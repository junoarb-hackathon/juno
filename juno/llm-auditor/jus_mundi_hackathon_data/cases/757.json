PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n**1. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy letter of June 26, 2001, MTD Equity Sdn (\"MTD Equity\"), a Malaysian company, and MTD Chile S.A (\"MTD Chile\"), a Chilean company, (collectively \"the Claimants\"or \"MTD\") filed a request for arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") against the Republic of Chile (\"the Respondent\" or \"Chile\"). The request, invoked the ICSID Arbitration provisions of the 1992 Agreement between the Government of Malaysia and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"the BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Centre, on 27 June 2001, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"Institution Rules\") acknowledged receipt of the request and on the same day transmitted a copy to the Republic of Chile and to the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nOn July 17, 2001, the Centre requested further information from the Claimants, with regard to the fulfillment by both Claimants of the requirement set forth in Articles 6(3)(i) and (ii) of the BIT concerning an attempt to resolve the dispute amicably through consultation and negotiation at least three months before the request for arbitration. The Centre also sought confirmation from the Claimants that neither of them had submitted the dispute to courts or administrative tribunals of Chile, as precluded by Article 6(3)(ii) and (iii) of the BIT; and that the majority of the shares in the second Claimant, MTD Chile were, for purposes of Article 6(2) of the BIT, owned by investors of Malaysia before the dispute arose. The Claimants responded by a letter of July 30, 2001.\n\n4.\n\nThe request was registered by the Centre on August 6, 2001, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, and on the same day the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**2. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThere were two successive arbitral tribunals in this case, the present Tribunal having been appointed upon the joint resignation of the first set of arbitrators.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the registration of the request for arbitration by the Centre, the parties agreed on a three-member Tribunal. The parties had agreed that each would appoint an arbitrator and that the third arbitrator, who would be the president of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants appointed Mr. James H. Carter Jr., a national of the United States of America, and the Respondent appointed Professor W. Michael Reisman, also a national of the United States of America. By agreement, the parties appointed Mr. Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez, a national of Mexico, as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre by a letter of March 5, 2002, informed the parties of the constitution of the Tribunal, consisting of Mr. James H. Carter Jr., Professor W. Michael Reisman, and Mr. Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez (\"the first Tribunal\"), and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1).\n\n9.\n\nAs agreed between the first Tribunal and the parties, in consultation with the Centre, the first Tribunal held its first session in New York on May 29, 2002, with the parties attending.\n\n10.\n\nIn advance of that session, the parties, by a joint letter dated May 24, 2002, communicated to the Tribunal their agreement on several items on the agenda proposed for the session. Those agreements by the parties were affirmed at the meeting and incorporated in the minutes.\n\n11.\n\nArbitrators had requested a rate of remuneration higher than the Centre's current rate. The Respondent and the Claimants, by letters dated September 17, 2002 and September 24, 2002, respectively, advised the Tribunal that they were unable to offer the rate of remuneration proposed by the Tribunal members.\n\n12.\n\nBy a letter dated October 2, 2002, the Tribunal notified the parties that it would not be able to serve on the basis of the fees agreed by the parties and that each of its members would be resigning his appointment. By a joint letter of October 17, 2002, members of the first Tribunal tendered their resignation to the Secretary-General of the Centre.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 18, 2002, the Centre notified the parties of the resignations of Mr. Aguilar Alvarez, Mr. Carter and Professor Reisman and informed them that the proceeding was suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2). In accordance with Arbitration Rule 11, the parties were by that letter invited to appoint new arbitrators by the same method by which the initial arbitrators were appointed.\n\n**3. Appointment of the present Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nBy a letter of November 26, 2002, the Claimants informed the Centre of their appointment of Mr. Marc Lalonde, a Canadian national, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. James H. Carter, and invited the Respondent to appoint a replacement for Professor W. Michael Reisman and to engage in consultations aimed at reaching an agreement on the person to replace Mr. Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n15.\n\nBy a letter of December 16, 2002, the Respondent notified the Centre that it had appointed Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno Blanco, a national of Costa Rica, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Professor W. Michael Reisman.\n\n16.\n\nThe parties, by separate letters of January 23, 2003, notified the Centre of their appointment, by agreement, of Mr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nAll three arbitrators accepted their appointments and, on January 29, 2003, the Centre notified the parties that the Tribunal had been reconstituted and the proceeding recommenced on that day, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 12.\n\n**4. Written and Oral Procedure**\n---------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAt the first session of the first Tribunal on May 29, 2002, it was agreed that the proceeding would be in English and Spanish. Documents filed in one language would be followed within five business days by a translation in the other language. The procedural arrangements agreed by the first Tribunal have been adhered to by the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nThe following schedule was also agreed for the exchange of written submissions: t he Claimants to file their Memorial by October 1, 2002; the Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial by February 1, 2003; the Claimants to file their Reply by April 15, 2003; and the Respondent to file its Rejoinder by July 1, 2003.\n\n20.\n\nIt was also agreed that a hearing would be held from Monday August 4 to Thursday, August 14, 2003, including Saturday, August 9, 2003.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants filed their Memorial on October 1, 2002, followed on October 8, 2002 by a Spanish language translation. These submissions were not transmitted to the first Tribunal but were sent to the present Tribunal after it was constituted.\n\n22.\n\nUpon the resignation of the members of the first Tribunal, the proceeding was suspended on October 18, 2002, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2) which provides:\n\n\"Upon the notification by the Secretary-General of a vacancy on the Tribunal, the proceeding shall be or remain suspended until the vacancy has been filled.\"\n\n23.\n\nArbitration Rule 12 further provides:\n\n\"As soon as a vacancy on the Tribunal has been filled, the proceeding shall continue from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy occurred. \u2026\"\n\n24.\n\nOn December 26, 2002, the Respondent wrote to the Centre suggesting that the effect of ICSID Arbitration Rules 10(2) and 12 was that suspension of the proceeding upon the resignation of the first Tribunal meant a suspension of the schedule established for the filing of submissions, and requested an extension for the filing of its CounterMemorial. The Claimants in a letter of January 10, 2003 rejected the Respondent's interpretation of Arbitration Rule 10(2), but agreed with the Respondent that the matter should be determined by the new Tribunal upon its constitution.\n\n25.\n\nAfter the present Tribunal was constituted, by Procedural Order No. 1 of February 3, 2003, issued in English and Spanish, the Tribunal requested the parties to present, no later than by February 14, 2003, any observations that they may have on the effect of the suspension of the proceeding on time limits for filing pleadings. On that day, the parties simultaneously filed submissions.\n\n26.\n\nOn February 18, 2003, the Claimants requested the Tribunal \"to address one new argument\" asserted in the Respondent's submission of February 14, 2003.\n\n27.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 2, dated February 20, 2003, the Tribunal decided:\n\n\"that the meaning of the term \u2018suspension' in Rules 10 and 12 of the [ICSID] Arbitration Rules applies to all matters related to the proceeding, including time limits, and not only to matters related to action required from the Tribunal,  \nthat the time limit to present the counter-memorial originally fixed [for] February 1, 2003 [be] extended by 103 days [the duration of the suspension] to May 15, 2003.\"\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal in that Order then directed the parties:\n\n\"(a) to consult each other on the subsequent schedule of the proceeding and other pending matters, including the matter related to business records, and\n\n(b) advise the Tribunal of the result of their consultations not later than March 14, 2003.\"\n\n29.\n\nBy a letter of March 14, 2003, the Claimants notified the Tribunal that the parties were still in discussions on the modified schedule.\n\n30.\n\nBy a letter of March 17, 2003, the Claimants advised the Tribunal of their agreed schedule for the submission of the remaining pleadings and notified the Tribunal that the parties had resolved the matter related to the business records referred to in Procedural Order No. 2. The Respondent in a letter of March 18, 2003, confirmed the agreement of the parties as communicated in the Claimants' letter of the previous day.\n\n31.\n\nFollowing a request by the Tribunal that the hearing commence a day later than that proposed by the parties, and correspondence with the parties in that regard, the Tribunal, by a letter dated April 21, 2003, formally took note of the agreed schedule for the submission of the remaining pleadings and proposed dates of the hearing from December 9, 2003 to December 19, 2003, including Saturday, December 13.\n\n32.\n\nOn June 9, 2003, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial in English and the Spanish version on June 16, 2003.\n\n33.\n\nBy letters of July 11, 2003 and July 14, 2003, respectively, the Claimants and the Respondent notified the Tribunal of each other's witnesses and experts that should be made available for cross examination at the oral hearing.\n\n34.\n\nOn September 15, 2003, the Claimants filed their Reply in English language, followed on September 23, 2003 by Spanish translations.\n\n35.\n\nOn October 14, 2003, counsel for the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal concerning their participation in the proceeding stating that:\n\n\"due solely to budgetary constraints faced by the Republic of Chile, White & Case LLP must withdraw as counsel of record for the Respondent in respect of [this] case. For the avoidance of doubt we wish to emphasize that our withdrawal does not relate in any way to the merits of the issues raised in the case. We shall assume limited role as advisor to the Republic of Chile with regard to this matter.\n\nAll communications and service of documents henceforth may continue to be addressed to us, as well as the other advisors of the Republic in regard to this matter\".\n\n36.\n\nOn November 21, 2003, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder in Spanish language, followed by the English language version on December 1, 2003.\n\n37.\n\nAs previously agreed, the hearing on merits was held from December 9 to 19, 2003, in Washington, D.C., at the seat of the Centre. The hearing was conducted in English and Spanish and full verbatim transcripts in both languages were made and distributed to the parties.\n\n38.\n\nPursuant to Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on March 26, 2004, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed, having deliberated by various means.\n\n**II. THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n39.\n\nThe facts described below follow the narrative of the Claimants and, unless noted, have not been contested by the Respondent.\n\n40.\n\nIn 1994 Dato'1 Nik of MTD visited Chile as a member of a trade delegation organized by the Malaysian Ministry of Public Works. During this visit, he met with government officials and business leaders who emphasized Chile's encouragement of foreign investment. Dato' Nik so reported to the Management Committee of MTD. He also met with Mr. Musa Muhamad, the Malaysian External Trade Commissioner in the Malaysian embassy in Santiago, who encouraged MTD to invest in Chile.2\n\n\"Dato'\" is a Malaysian title of honor.\n\nMemorial, para. 13.\n\n41.\n\nIn April 1996, Dato' Nik heard from Mr. Muhamad about \"an opportunity to build a large planned community near Santiago.\" Dato' Nik informed Dato' Azmil Khalid who at the time was traveling in the United States. Dato' Azmil Khalid traveled directly from the United States to Chile to investigate this opportunity. There he met with Messrs. Muhamad and Antonio Arenas, a local businessman. They informed Dato' Khalid that they had found \"the perfect location for a planned community.\"3\n\nIbid., paras. 14-15.\n\n42.\n\nDato' Khalid visited the site in the small town of Pirque and met with the owner of the land, Mr. Jorge Fontaine Aldunate. Mr. Fontaine is reported to have said that \"he would like to work with MTD to build a mixed-use planned community on the Malaysian model\". Although the site was zoned for agricultural use, Mr. Fontaine is alleged to have said that the land was unproductive and \"could readily be rezoned, particularly if it would attract foreign investment.\"4\n\nIbid., para. 16.\n\n43.\n\nDato' Khalid returned to Malaysia and reported to MTD's Management Committee about this opportunity in Chile. The Management Committee decided to investigate it further. For this purpose, Messrs. Lee Leong Yow (Vincent Lee), MTD's Group General Manager and Head of Operations, and Nazri Shafiee, expert in land valuation, traveled to Chile from May 14 to May 18, 1996. Dato' Nik was also in Chile on May 16-17, 1996. He visited the project site and met with Mr. Fontaine and his family.5\n\nIbid., para. 13.\n\n44.\n\nMessrs. Lee and Shafiee visited the Foreign Investment Commission (FIC) on May 16, 1996. There they met with Mr. Joaqu\u00edn Morales Godoy, Senior Legal Counsel.6 The next day, Mr. Shafiee met with Mr. Fernando Guerra Francovich, the head of Servicio de Vivienda y Urbanizaci\u00f3n (\"SERVIU\").7 After these meetings, Messrs. Lee and Shafiee concluded that MTD should pursue the investment opportunity and so reported to MTD's Management Committee.8 Based on their report, the Management Committee decided \"to pursue negotiations with Mr. Fontaine while continuing to study the feasibility of a joint venture to develop the Project.\"9\n\nIbid., paras. 20-22.\n\nIbid., para. 23.\n\nIbid., paras. 25-26.\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\n45.\n\nMTD engaged Banco Sud Americano in Santiago to appraise the land. In September 1996, the appraisers submitted their report valuing the land of Mr. Fontaine, 3000 hectares, at $34,385,487. The appraisal assumed that the land could be developed as an upscale community after changing the existing zoning for agricultural use.10\n\nIbid., para. 28.\n\n46.\n\nIn September 1996, the negotiations of MTD with Mr. Fontaine appeared to have reached a dead end because of disagreement on which hectares to develop and the control of the joint venture: Mr. Fontaine wanted: (i) to develop all 3000 hectares while MTD wished to develop first the 600 located at the lowest elevations; and (ii) a 50/50 split of the equity while for MTD it was essential to have control.11\n\nIbid., para. 29.\n\n47.\n\nNegotiations resumed in November 1996. The law firm Vial & Palma represented MTD, specifically attorneys Alberto Labb\u00e9 Valverde and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Olivares. The parties prepared a \"Promissory Contract\" dated as of November 21, 1996.12\n\nIbid., para. 30.\n\n48.\n\nOn November 6, 1996, according to the Respondent, a meeting took place between Mr. Edmundo Hermosilla, Minister of MINVU, Mr. Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez Tapia, *Secretario Regional Ministerial* (\"SEREMI\"), and representatives of MTD.13 That this meeting took place, who attended and what was said at the meeting is a matter of controversy between the parties.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 24.\n\n49.\n\nIn December 1996, Messrs. Dato' Azmil Khalid and Lee negotiated the documents implementing the Promissory Contract and signed them on December 13, 1996.14 The Promissory Contract would take effect only after FIC's approval of the MTD's investment and provided for: (i) development of the land at first in two tranches of 600 and 630 hectares, the second tranche at the option of MTD; and (ii) the creation of a Chilean corporation, \"El Principal Inversiones S.A.\" (\"EPSA\"), to be owned 51 per cent by MTD Chile S.A. and 49 per cent by Mr. Fontaine.15\n\nMemorial, para. 30.\n\nIbid., para. 31.\n\n50.\n\nOn December 13, 1996, after signature of the Promissory Contract, Dato' Khalid and Mr. Labb\u00e9 met with Mr. Eduardo Moyano, Executive Vice President of the FIC.16\n\nIbid., para. 32.\n\n51.\n\nOn January 14, 1997, MTD filed an application with the FIC for approval of an initial investment of US$ 17,136 million. The application described the project as follows:\n\n\"[D]evelop a township of 600 hectares of Fundo El Principal de Pirque, which will be a self-sufficient satellite city, with houses, apartments for diverse socioeconomic strata, schools, hospitals, universities, supermarkets, commerce of all sorts, services, and all other components necessary for self-sufficiency\" (Exhibit 12 at 3. Translation of the Claimants).\"\n\n52.\n\nThe application specified the location as \"Pirque, Metropolitan Region\" and that \"the investment would provide initial capital to a newly formed corporation named MTD Chile S.A., which would use the capital to acquire a 51 percent stake in El Principal S.A., which would own the land and develop the Project.\"17\n\nIbid., para. 33.\n\n53.\n\nThe application was approved by the FIC at its session of March 3, 1997. The following members of FIC attended: the President of FIC (the Minister of Economy, Development and Reconstruction), the President of the Central Bank, the Undersecretary of Finance, the Undersecretary of Mining, and the Undersecretary of Planning and Cooperation. The FIC informed MTD of the approval by letter dated March 6, 1997 and enclosed the standard contract used by Chile for these purposes.18\n\nIbid., paras. 35 and 36\n\n54.\n\nThe Foreign Investment Contract was signed on March 18, 1997 by the President of FIC on behalf of Chile and Mr. Labb\u00e9 on behalf of MTD. The Foreign Investment Contract provides that MTD will develop \"a real estate project on 600 hectares of Fundo El Principal de Pirque. The aforementioned project consists of the construction of a self-sufficient satellite city, with houses, apartments, schools, hospitals, commerce, services, etc.\" (\"the Project\").19\n\nExhibit 14 to the Memorial at 2.\n\n55.\n\nAfter signature of the Foreign Investment Contract, MTD injected US$ 8.4 million into EPSA as a capital contribution and with US$ 8,736 million MTD purchased 51% of the EPSA shares from Mr. Fontaine \"who was receiving them in return for his contribution to EPSA of 600 hectares of land.\"20 The funds contributed by MTD came from the resources of the MTD group and US$ 12 million from a loan made to MTD by the Arab-Malaysian Bank in Kuala Lumpur.21\n\nIbid., para. 43.\n\nIbid., para. 43.\n\n56.\n\nIn March 1997, MTD representatives met three architectural firms of Santiago\n\n\"to assist in the design work, performing engineering studies and obtaining regulatory approvals\"22: Darraidou, Larrain & Uranga (DLU), San Mart\u00edn & Pascal and URBE. In April 1997, MTD selected DLU \"to assist in obtaining zoning changes, subdividing the land, and designing prototype models of the houses and other structures.\"23 According to the Claimant, all three firms confirmed that the process to change the zoning would need to be initiated by the Municipality of Pirque and the change would need to be endorsed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (\"MINVU\").24\n\nIbid., para. 44.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n57.\n\nMTD submitted a second application to FIC on April 8, 1997 for approval to invest additional working capital of US$ 364,000. The second application was approved by FIC and MTD informed by letter dated April 22, 1997. The letter of approval enclosed the form of the standard foreign investment contract. The contract for this additional investment was signed on May 13, 1997. Its second clause provides that the investment will be used \"[t]o make capital contributions and/or increases to the Chilean receiving company called MTD Chile S.A., which is developing a real estate project on 600 hectares of the Fundo El Principal de Pirque.\"25\n\nMemorial, para. 39.\n\n58.\n\nOn April 22, 1997, representatives of MTD and Mr. Labb\u00e9 met with Messrs. Alberto Carbacho Duarte, the MINVU architect with overall responsibility for the Southern region of Santiago, which includes Pirque, and Mr. Sergio Lepe Corval\u00e1n, an official in the same office. According to the Claimants, Messrs. Carbacho and Lepe explained that \"because Pirque was covered by the *Plano Regulador Metropolitano de* *Santiago* (PMRS) [...] the MINVU would need to coordinate and approve the necessary zoning changes for the Project...the review process would be handled at the MINVU by the *Secretario Regional Ministerial* (SEREMI).\"26\n\nIbid., para. 45.\n\n59.\n\nOn May 16, 1997, representatives of MTD met with the Mayor of Pirque, Mr. Manuel Jos\u00e9 Ossand\u00f3n.27\n\nIbid., para. 46.\n\n60.\n\nOn May 20, 1997, Dato' Azmil Khalid met with Minister Edmundo Hermosilla. The same day, the MTD team met with Mr. Ricardo Lagos Escobar, then Minister of Public Works.\n\n61.\n\nThe Mayor of Pirque formally endorsed the Project by a letter dated August 14, 1997 and offered his assistance in obtaining approvals.28\n\nIbid., para. 50.\n\n62.\n\nDuring this period, Minister Hermosilla was replaced by Mr. Sergio Henr\u00edquez D\u00edaz.\n\n63.\n\nOn September 29, 1997, at an official state dinner on the occasion of the visit of the Prime Minister of Malaysia to Chile, President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle of Chile delivered a toast making reference, *inter alia*, to \"*the innovative real estate project in Pirque*\" Memorial, para. 51.29 The next day appearance of the President at the inauguration of the Project was cancelled because of an alleged meeting with the President of Brazil. According to the Respondent, the speech to be read by the President, that was already in the hands of the Claimants, was withdrawn. This fact is contested by the Claimants.\n\nIbid., para. 51.\n\n64.\n\nAround November, 1997, \"MTD heard from its consultants that SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez of the MINVU was showing reluctance about modifying the PMRS for Pirque.\"30\n\nIbid., para. 54.\n\n65.\n\nOn December 12, 1997, the *Diario Oficial* published the approval of the modification of the PMRS to include the Chacabuco area, North of Santiago, in order to permit its development under the system of *Zonas de Desarrollo Urbano Condicionado* (\"ZDUCs\").31\n\nIbid., para. 54.\n\n66.\n\nIn early 1998, MTD engaged the services of Mr. Pablo Heilenkotter, an attorney with expertise in land use regulation and real estate development. Since SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez was unwilling to initiate the process to change the zoning, Mr. Heilenkotter and other consultants considered other alternatives under the *Ley General de Urbanismo y Construcci\u00f3n* (\"LGUC\"): \"(i) the preparation of a sectional plan limited to a modification for the zoning in the area of the Project; (ii) the preparation of a communal plan for the Municipality of Pirque that would also include a zoning change for the area of the Project; and (iii) an application under article 55 for the construction of housing to complement a pre-existing activity.\"32\n\nIbid., para. 55.\n\n67.\n\nMr. Heilenkotter met with Mr. Lepe on March 6, 1998, and two weeks later with Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez together with other consultants of MTD. According to the Claimants, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez informed them that he did not wish to undertake another modification to the PMRS \"because it had just been changed in December 1997 to incorporate the Chacabuco area.\"33\n\nIbid., paras. 56-57\n\n68.\n\nAs MTD understood the LGUC, it was possible to pursue a change by way of a sectional plan and the *Consejo Regional de la Regi\u00f3n Metropolitana* (\"CORE\") would \"ultimately decide whether to approve the sectional plan, and it could do so over the MINVU's objection.\"34\n\nIbid., para. 58.\n\n69.\n\nAt this point, the Mayor of Pirque proposed to the Municipal Council to prepare a sectional plan to obtain a change in zoning. The Council approved such approach and the Mayor informed EPSA on March 31, 1998.\n\n70.\n\nOn April 13, 1998, MTD representatives and consultants met with Mr. Quintana, the CORE President. He suggested that, since Pirque did not have a Communal Regulatory Plan, the Municipality should submit with its sectional plan a strategic plan outlining Pirque's anticipated growth.35\n\nIbid., para. 60.\n\n71.\n\nSometime in April 1998, Dato' Azmil Khalid met with FIC Executive Vice-President Moyano \"to discuss the slow progress of the zoning change request\". Mr. Moyano reportedly said that he would make inquiries.36\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\n72.\n\nOn April 16, 1998, the Mayor of Pirque, and MTD representatives and consultants met with Mr. Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez who informed them that the Project was inconsistent with MINVU's urban development policy37. After the meeting, the Mayor wrote to SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez asking for \"guidance about presenting a sectional plan to the MINVU for the development of the Project.\"38\n\nIbid., para. 61.\n\nIbid., para. 63.\n\n73.\n\nOn April 20 1998, Mayor Ossand\u00f3n requested a meeting with the new MINVU Minister, Mr. Henr\u00edquez. The meeting took place on May 6, 1998 and it was also attended by representatives and consultants of MTD.39\n\nIbid., para. 62.\n\n74.\n\nThe SEREMI's office responded to the letter of April 16 on June 3, 1998 and explained: that \"it would be inconvenient to initiate any changes to the PMRS pending completion of studies aimed at revising the *Plan Regional de Desarrollo Urbano* (PRDU)\"; that \"a sectional plan could not be used to obtain a change in zoning for the Project because only the SEREMI could initiate changes to the PMRS\"; and that \"before the investment contracts were signed, Minister Hermosilla had informed Mr. Fontaine and the Malaysian businessmen that it would not be possible to develop the Project in Pirque.\"40\n\nIbid., para. 63.\n\n75.\n\nAt the request of MTD and as a consequence of the letter of June 3, another meeting with Minister Henr\u00edquez took place on June 12, 1998. The Minister endorsed the letter of SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez and confirmed that the MINVU would \"neither initiate nor support any modification to the PMRS that would allow the Project to proceed.\"41\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\n76.\n\nThe same day, Mr. Heilenkotter met with Mr. Banderas of the FIC who informed him that \"the FIC could not assist MTD and that its role is strictly limited to approving the inflow of foreign investment funds into Chile\".42 At the request of Mr. Labb\u00e9, another meeting took place with Messrs. Moyano and Banderas. Mr. Moyano confirmed at the meeting that the approval of the FIC was without prejudice to other necessary approvals and that the FIC's authority was limited to the approval of the flow of funds into the country.43\n\nIbid, para. 66\n\nIbid., para. 67.\n\n77.\n\nThe Council of the Municipality of Pirque approved the Sectional Plan on July 3, 1998 and the Mayor submitted it to the SEREMI of MINVU on August 11, 1998. On September 8, 1998, the Mayor also submitted an Environmental Impact Study (\"EIS\") to the *Comisi\u00f3n Regional del Medio Ambiente, Regi\u00f3n Metropolitana* (\"COREMA\"). On September 15, 1998, the COREMA informed the Municipality that it would review the EIS and announced the review in a public statement.44\n\nIbid., paras. 70-71.\n\n78.\n\nMTD's representatives held meetings with Mr. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who suggested that the Malaysian Government write him and President Frei requesting assistance to address MTD's situation. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia wrote to Mr. Insulza and the Malaysian Prime Minister to President Frei on September 11 and September 15, 1998, respectively.45\n\nIbid., para. 69.\n\n79.\n\nOn September 25, 1998, the SEREMI of the MINVU returned the sectional plan to the Mayor of Pirque without evaluating the plan on its merits. The letter of SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez indicated that \"only the SEREMI could change the PRMS, that doing so would be \u2018inconvenient', and that a sectional plan could not be used to modify the PMRS.\"46\n\nIbid., para. 72.\n\n80.\n\nOn October 19, 1998, MTD's representatives and their advisors met with the MINVU Minister, Mr. Henr\u00edquez, and SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez. Mr. Henr\u00edquez re-affirmed that the policy of the Government was to encourage development of Santiago towards the North and not the South where Pirque is located. Hence, he would not support the required zoning change, and the Project should be built elsewhere in Chile. On October 27, 1998, Mr. Shafiee sent Mr. Henr\u00edquez a letter thanking him for the meeting and including draft minutes of the meeting. The Minister responded on November 4, 1998 formally rejecting the Project. He stated that the SEREMI of the MINVU \"will not initiate a change to the Regulating Plan for the Santiago Metropolitan Region to make this project possible\". In a press release of the same day, MINVU indicated that it had rejected the Project because it conflicted with existing urban development policy and that the Mayor of Pirque no longer supported the Project.47\n\nIbid., paras. 74-75.\n\n81.\n\nOn November 26, 1998, the COREMA rejected the EIS because the sectional plan was incompatible with the existing zoning for the land.48\n\nIbid., para. 77.\n\n82.\n\nOn December 15, 1998, the MINVU issued a more detailed press release about the rejection of the Project.49\n\nIbid., para. 75.\n\n83.\n\nOn June 2, 1999, MTD notified the Respondent that an investment dispute existed under the Malaysia-Chile Bilateral Investment Treaty (the BIT). At the end of the three-month negotiation period required by the BIT before the dispute may be brought to arbitration, no solution to the dispute had been found.50 At the request of the Respondent, the parties agreed to a 30-day extension of the negotiation period. Negotiations continued without an agreement being reached at the expiry of the extension.51\n\nIbid., para. 80.\n\nIbid., para. 81.\n\n84.\n\nOn September 9, 1999, a third Foreign Investment Contract was signed between Chile and MTD for the purpose of providing an additional US$ 25,000 of working capital to MTD Chile. As stated in the Memorial, \"The third Contract was executed after the State of Chile had announced that the Project was incompatible with its urban-development policy and does not reference the Project in Pirque.\"52\n\nIbid., para. 40.\n\n85.\n\nOn October 8, 1999, MTD informed representatives of the Respondent that it would pursue this matter in formal dispute settlement proceedings under the auspices of ICSID. MTD continued to meet with representatives of the Respondent until it filed the request for arbitration in June 2001.53\n\nIbid., paras. 82 and 84.\n\n**III. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n86.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the Convention is the relevant provision for determining the law applicable to the merits of the dispute between the parties. This article requires the Tribunal to \"decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties\". This being a dispute under the BIT, the parties have agreed that the merits of the dispute be decided in accordance with international law. Applicable law has not been a matter of controversy between the parties except as it pertains to the issue of whether the Respondent has failed to meet its obligations, under the Foreign Investment Contracts, to grant the necessary permits for the Claimants to carry out their investment in Chile. The Claimants argue that the alleged failure of the Respondent has to be considered under international law because Article 3(1) of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Chile and Denmark (the \"Denmark BIT\") has the effect of internationalizing the obligations of the Respondent under the Foreign Investment Contracts. The Respondent denies that Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT had such effect and maintains that Chilean law applies on the basis of Article 42(1) of the Convention. The Respondent affirms that, in the absence of agreement between the parties, \"The applicable law in regard to the foreign investment contracts is Chilean domestic legislation, according to the provisions of the Washington Convention.\"54\n\nRejoinder, para. 126 and footnote 61.\n\n87.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal will limit itself to note that, for purposes of Article 42(1) of the Convention, the parties have agreed to this arbitration under the BIT. This instrument being a treaty, the agreement to arbitrate under the BIT requires the Tribunal to apply international law. The Tribunal will analyze further this issue when considering the effect of Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT.\n\n**2. Significance of an Investment Dispute**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAt the beginning of its Counter-Memorial, Chile has made statements and provided statistics in support of Chile as \"a place to invest\". Indeed, between 1974 and 2001, US$ 82.9 billion in foreign investment were authorized, and more than four thousand companies invested in Chile. Chile has also pointed out that the case before the Tribunal is the first time that foreign investors appear before ICSID claiming that Chile violated DL 60055 and engaged in discriminatory practices.56\n\nDecree Law 600, the Foreign Investment Law of the Republic of Chile.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 1 and 2.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal, in noting the success of the Respondent in attracting foreign investment, wishes to record its understanding that a dispute before an ICSID Tribunal is not necessarily a black mark on the record of a country or an investor. Bilateral investment treaties are relatively new and it is not unreasonable that their application or the many factors that affect foreign investment be a source of disagreement. The fact that disagreements are brought to the decision of a third party, such as an ICSID arbitral tribunal, and that a country has offered to do so in a treaty strengthens rather than detracts from a country's endeavor to attract foreign investment and treat investors fairly and equitably.\n\n**3. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n90.\n\nAs regards the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal, the Claimants maintain that their dispute with the Respondent is a legal dispute that arises out of an investment made in Chile by a national of another Contracting State, Malaysia. The Respondent has not raised any objections about this matter.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration under the BIT and the Claimants consented when they filed their request for arbitration.\n\n92.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes [\u2026] any dispute arising between that Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party which involves: (i) an obligation entered into by that Contracting Party with the investor of the other Contracting Party regarding an investment by such investor, or (ii) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment by such investor.\"\n\n93.\n\nMTD Equity is a \"national of another Contracting State\": it is a corporation organized under the laws of Malaysia and has its seat and operations in Malaysia. It is also an \"investor\" under the terms of Article 1(c)(ii) of the BIT, which defines investor as including: \"any corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, organization, association or enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of that Contracting Party and have their seat and operations in the territory of that same Contracting Party.\"\n\n94.\n\nMTD Chile is wholly owned by MTD Equity and is a corporation organized under the laws of Chile. Under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 6(2) of the BIT, such a corporation is to be deemed as a Malaysian national for purposes of arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention.\n\n95.\n\nThe dispute between the parties qualifies as a dispute under each of the categories of Article 6(1) of the BIT. It involves an obligation entered into by the Respondent with the Claimants regarding their investment in Chile and an alleged breach of their rights under the BIT in respect of such investment.\n\n96.\n\nThe requirement of Article 6(3)(i) of the BIT that the parties try to solve the dispute \"amicably through consultation and negotiation\" for at least three months before resorting to arbitration has also been satisfied. Negotiations took place for a period exceeding three months and through a one-month extension after the Claimants notified, on June 2, 1999, the President of Chile and the Minister of Economy that a dispute had arisen and invoked Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the dispute between the parties arises out of an investment made by MTD Equity, a national of Malaysia, in Chile and that the investment so made qualifies as such under the Convention and the BIT.\n\n**4. The Right of States to adopt Policy and enact Legislation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with statements made by the Respondent to the effect that it has a right to decide its urban policies and legislation. Indeed, the States parties to the BIT have agreed that their commitment to encourage and create favorable conditions for investors and admit their investments is \"subject to [each party's] rights to exercise powers conferred by its laws, regulations and national policies.\"57 Furthermore, in the definition of investment, the term \"investment\" is understood to refer to \"all investments approved by the appropriate Ministries or authorities of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its legislation and national policies.\"58\n\nArticle 2(1).\n\nArticle 1(b).\n\n99.\n\nThus, by entering into the BIT, the Contracting Parties did not limit the exercise of their authority under their national laws or policies except to the extent that this exercise would contravene obligations undertaken in the BIT itself. An arbitral tribunal in the specific case of ICSID would not consider the policies or legislation of a country and changes thereto unless a connection can be established with the investment concerned. This connection may be \"established if those general measures are adopted in violation of specific commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts. What is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments.\"59\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Republic of Argentina.* Case No. ARB/01/8 *.* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 27.\n\n**5. The Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Clause**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants have based in part their claims on provisions of other bilateral investment treaties and have alleged that these provisions apply by operation of the MFN clause of the BIT. The Respondent has not argued against the application of these provisions but, in the case of Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT and Article 3(3) and (4) of the bilateral investment treaty between Chile and Croatia (\"the Croatia BIT\"), the Respondent has qualified its arguments by stating that, even in the event that the clause concerned would apply, the facts of the case are such that it would not have been breached. Because of this qualification in the Counter-Memorial and the Rejoinder, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine the MFN clause in the BIT and satisfy itself that its terms permit the use of the provisions of the Denmark BIT and Croatia BIT as a legal basis for the claims submitted to its decision.\n\n101.\n\nThe first paragraph of the MFN clause of the BIT - (Article 3(1)) - reads as follows:\n\n\"1. Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable, and not less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State.\"\n\n102.\n\nThe other provisions of this Article extend the clause to compensation related to losses suffered because of wars or like events or limit its application by excluding benefits provided in regional cooperation and taxation related agreements.\n\n103.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether the provisions of the Croatia BIT and the Denmark BIT which deal with the obligation to award permits subsequent to approval of an investment and to fulfillment of contractual obligations, respectively, can be considered to be part of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the meaning of fair and equitable treatment below and refers to that discussion. The Tribunal has concluded that, under the BIT, the fair and equitable standard of treatment has to be interpreted in the manner most conducive to fulfill the objective of the BIT to protect investments and create conditions favorable to investments. The Tribunal considers that to include as part of the protections of the BIT those included in Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT and Article 3(3) and (4) of the Croatia BIT is in consonance with this purpose. The Tribunal is further convinced of this conclusion by the fact that the exclusions in the MFN clause relate to tax treatment and regional cooperation, matters alien to the BIT but that, because of the general nature of the MFN clause, the Contracting Parties considered it prudent to exclude. *A contrario sensu,* other matters that can be construed to be part of the fair and equitable treatment of investors would be covered by the clause.\n\n**IV. CONSIDERATIONS ON THE MERITS**\n------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached:\n\n(i) Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the BIT and Article 4(1) of the Croatia BIT by treating their investment unfairly and inequitably;\n\n(ii) Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT by breaching the Respondent's obligations under the Foreign Investment Contracts;\n\n(iii) Article 3(2) and (4) of the Croatia BIT by impairing through unreasonable and discriminatory measures the use and enjoyment of the Claimants' investment and by failing to grant the necessary permits to carry out an investment already authorized; and\n\n(iv) Article 4 of the BIT by expropriating their investment.\n\n106.\n\nThe alleged breaches of the Denmark and Croatia BITs are based on the MFN clause of the BIT. The Tribunal will now consider each of these claims and the allegation made by the Respondent that the Claimants acted irresponsibly and contrary to the prudent and diligent standard of behavior expected from an experienced investor.\n\n**1. Fair and equitable treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the BIT requires that \"Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all time be accorded fair and equitable treatment [...]\" The Croatia BIT provides that the right to fair and equitable treatment shall \"not be hindered in practice\" (Article 4(1)). There is no dispute between the parties about the applicability of these provisions, but they disagree on key facts to determine whether the standard of fair and equitable treatment has been breached. They also disagree on the significance of actions taken by the Respondent in relation to the approval of the investment and the execution of the Foreign Investment Contracts, and the significance of the conduct of the Claimants in reaching and executing their decision to invest in Chile.\n\n108.\n\nThe parties appear to agree on the meaning of fair and equitable treatment, but in view of comments made by them in the memorials, the Tribunal will address this matter first and then will consider the facts underlying the Claimants' submission for purposes of applying this standard of treatment.\n\n***(i) Meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\"***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe parties agree that there is an obligation to treat investments fairly and equitably. The parties also agree with the statement of Judge Schwebel that \"the meaning of what is fair and equitable is defined when that standard is applied to a set of specific facts\"60 As defined by Judge Schwebel, \"fair and equitable treatment\" is \"a broad and widely-accepted standard encompassing such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, nondiscrimination, and proportionality\"61.\n\nOpinion of Judge Steven Schwebel, para. 23. Witness Statement submitted with the Memorial.\n\nIbid.\n\n110.\n\nThe parties have commented on whether the fair and equitable standard is part of customary international law or additional to customary international law in reference to recent awards of arbitral tribunals established under NAFTA before and after the interpretation of Article 1105(1) by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission. The Free Trade Commission has interpreted \"fair and equitable treatment\" as not requiring treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the international law minimum standard.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Chile has not argued that this is how \"fair and equitable treatment\" should be understood under the BIT. Chile has simply drawn attention to this interpretation and the consequences it had on the application of the standard of fair and equitable treatment by NAFTA arbitral tribunals. The Tribunal further notes that there is no reference to customary international law in the BIT in relation to fair and equitable treatment.\n\n112.\n\nThis being a Tribunal established under the BIT, it is obliged to apply the provisions of the BIT and interpret them in accordance with the norms of interpretation established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties, which is binding on the State parties to the BIT. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires that a treaty be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n113.\n\nIn their ordinary meaning, the terms \"fair\" and \"equitable\" used in Article 3(1)62 of the BIT mean \"just\", \"even-handed\", \"unbiased\", \"legitimate\".63 These terms are also used in Article 2(2) of the BIT entitled \"Promotion and Protection of Investments\"64. As regards the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal refers to its Preamble where the parties state their desire \"to create favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\", and the recognition of \"the need to protect investments by investors of both Contracting Parties and to stimulate the flow of investments and individual business initiative with a view to the economic prosperity of both Contracting Parties\". Hence, in terms of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. Its terms are framed as a pro-active statement -\"to promote\", \"to create\", \"to stimulate\"- rather than prescriptions for a passive behavior of the State or avoidance of prejudicial conduct to the investors.\n\nArticle 3(1): \"Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable, and not less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State.\"\n\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, fifth edition.\n\nArticle 2(2): \"Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all time be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n114.\n\nFaced with a similar task, the tribunal in *TECMED* described the concept of fair and equitable treatment as follows:\n\n\"[...] to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the state that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities. The investor also expects the state to use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation.\"65\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)00/2, award dated May 29, 2003, para. 154. See also *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, para. 98.\n\n115.\n\nThis is the standard that the Tribunal will apply to the facts of this case. The facts or their significance are controversial and the Tribunal will first describe the allegations of the parties as they relate to them.\n\n***(ii) Allegations of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment provisions of the BIT and the Croatia BIT when it \"created and encouraged strong expectations that the Project, which was the object of the investment, could be built in the specific proposed location and entered into a contract confirming that location, but then disapproved that location as a matter of policy after MTD irrevocably committed its investment to build the Project in that location.\"66 Furthermore, to the extent that, as alleged by MINVU, the Respondent was always opposed to the Project even before the signing of the Foreign Investment Contracts, then the Respondent acted \"duplicitously and in bad faith, for at that time - according to the MINVU's argument - the State of Chile had already made a decision to block the Project.\"67 The Respondent disputes such allegations by referring to meetings the Claimants had with Government officials and by questioning the significance attributed by the Claimants to the approval of their investment by the FIC.\n\nMemorial, para. 102.\n\nIbid., para. 103.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent places great significance on the November 6, 1996 meeting with Minister Hermosilla and SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez. The Claimants deny that such meeting ever took place. According to the Respondent, in this meeting, the Chilean officials warned Claimants' representatives that \"the PMRS, which categorically forbade urban development in Pirque, posed a serious impediment to the Project\", and that \"because the Project was inconsistent with the goals of the PMRS, one of which was to promote urban densification, the office of the SEREMI would not be able to sponsor the project before the CORE.\"68 The Respondent concludes the narrative of the November 6 meeting by saying that that meeting \"should have left MTD with grave doubts about the viability of a real estate project in Pirque. At this point, a reasonable investor would have undertaken rigorous due diligence as to whether, among other things, any further developmental costs were warranted. Instead, despite having been put on clear notice that its proposed Project faced serious risks, MTD proceeded to enter into a joint venture agreement, further solidifying its commitment to the El Principal Project.\"69\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 25-27.\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that, through the many meetings that representatives of the Claimants had with officials of the Chilean Government, the Claimants were informed about the difficulty of achieving a change in the PMRS, that the SEREMI of MINVU had the initiative to propose such change, and that a sectional plan was not the proper vehicle to change the PMRS because it is an instrument hierarchically lower from a normative point of view. The meetings that the Claimants had with various urban planning firms in March 1997 and related correspondence show that already at that time they were aware of the need to re-zone El Principal.70\n\nIbid., paras. 48-96.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent further alleges that the role of the FIC is only to approve the capital transfer and not the details of the project itself, hence the limited nature of the description of the purpose of the investment. The Foreign Investment Contracts guarantee the foreign investor the same treatment as a national investor and provide that the authorization to import capital into Chile is \"without prejudice to any others which, pursuant to such laws and regulations must be granted by the competent authorities.\" Therefore, the Foreign Investment Contracts required \"MTD to obtain zoning permits, environmental approvals and other applicable authorizations relating to the Project.\"71\n\nIbid., paras. 31-32.\n\n120.\n\nAs regards claims of Chile's extra-contractual liability, the Respondent alleges that they \"betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the FIC approval process and other provisions of Chilean law\", and contests even the existence of a possibility of extra-contractual liability: if a contract exists, \"a claim may only be brought alleging the contractual breach; an additional claim alleging quasi-contractual liability is inadmissible.\"72\n\nIbid., para. 129 quoting expert Feli\u00fa's opinion.\n\n121.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the FIC is not obliged under article 15(c) of DL 600, as the Claimants maintain, to obtain reports prior to deciding on foreign investment applications except in limited circumstances required by legislation other than DL 600 itself. There is no legal norm or regulation that imposes upon the FIC the obligation to obtain from any other authority a report or pre-approval of a real estate project such as the proposed investment of the Claimants.73 The FIC is not required either to seek a change in the PMRS after the approval of the foreign investment application. If this were the case, then Article 9 of DL 600 and Clause Four of the foreign investment contracts would be rendered meaningless and the FIC would operate outside the scope of its authority.74\n\nIbid., para. 131.\n\nIbid., para. 133.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the FIC's jurisdiction does not \"extend to determining the legal, administrative, technical or economic feasibility of those investments, nor does it restrict or limit the authority or jurisdiction of any government agency. The jurisprudence of domestic courts has uniformly recognized the limited jurisdiction of the Committee and the limited scope of the Investment Contract.\"75 According to the Respondent, the Claimants have completely misrepresented the functions of the FIC by assigning to it the character of a \"one-stop window\". As explained by expert Feli\u00fa, in public law the \"*principle of lawfulness\"* requires that, in order for a public body to act as a \"one-stop window\", it needs to be so authorized.76 It was not the FIC's \"duty to reject MTD's Foreign Investment Application due to restrictions of land use, because the Committee did not have the legal authority to carry out such an evaluation. MTD chose to take the risk associated with its investment, which involved executing an urban development project in a restricted area, while speculating that the policies regarding land use in Chile would be modified in its favor.\"77 The Respondent maintains that the reference to the Municipality of Pirque in the Application does not modify \"the authority of the Committee, nor does it make the Committee the underwriter of the viability of the project.\"78\n\nRejoinder, para. 37.\n\nIbid., paras. 40-41.\n\nIbid., para. 47.\n\nIbid., para. 50.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent also dismisses the argument that it is extra-contractually liable because the Minister of MINVU, as \"relevant Minister\" under article 13(d) of the DL 600, did not attend the meeting which approved the Claimants' request. The Respondent maintains that this argument has no basis because under Article 14 the only requirement for a meeting is that a certain quorum be achieved with or without the \"relevant Minister\". In any case, it is the SEREMI of MINVU who is responsible for recommending the modification of the PMRS and the SEREMI acts independently of the MINVU Minister. The Respondent affirms further that, if the Minister of MINVU had attended the meeting, the outcome would have remained the same. He would presumably have commented that the project was risky but that in itself would not have been grounds for rejecting the application since the investor had the right to seek a modification of the PMRS: \"It is not within the FIC's authority or mandate to perform a risk assessment with respect to the investments that are the subject of the capital inflows it approves. The resolution of questions involving risk is wholly within the investor's sphere, and such issues have no bearing on the FIC's approval or disapproval of foreign investment applications.\"79\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 134-137. See also Rejoinder para. 68.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the November 6, 1996 meeting ever took place and consider that the meeting is \"crucial to the Respondent's case: this is the sole warning that MTD is alleged to have received before committing its investment\". The documents presented as evidence of what was said at the meeting were written in 1998, not in 1996.80 There are no contemporaneous records of the meeting except for the word \"Malaysia\" in the appointment book of Minister Hermosilla. The Claimants note that \"It is striking that the Respondent's witnesses - without contemporaneous documentary record of the meeting - now remember details of the discussion so well seven years later, but are unable to recall who attended.\"81\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\nIbid., para. 18.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the warnings that MTD allegedly received from architects, urban planners and government officials after signing the first Foreign Investment Contract would have come too late.82 The Claimants also note that, in its Reply, the Respondent does not acknowledge that the President of Chile praised the Project as innovative in September 1997 and the Claimants were never informed that the cancellation of the President's appearance the next day related to the withdrawing of support for the Project.83 In fact, the reason given was that the President could not attend because of a conflicting meeting with the President of Brazil.\n\nIbid., para. 7.\n\nIbid., para. 8.\n\n126.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it was only in 1998 that they were informed about the meeting of November 6, 1996, and that the approval of the investment application only meant that MTD could import funds and that Chilean officials first began to raise environmental concerns: \"The Respondent does not explain why these supposedly long-standing and important governmental positions and policies were not communicated to MTD before 1998.\"84\n\nIbid., para. 9.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimants address the Respondent's assertion that, if they had acted diligently, they \"would quickly have discovered that its [their] Project was unfeasible\" by pointing out the following flaws: \"*First*, if it was indeed so clear that the Project was not feasible, why did none of the many officials with whom MTD representatives met inform MTD of this impossibility until 1998? *Second*, the Respondent's \u2018due diligence' argument is premised on the warnings supposedly given to MTD at the phantom meeting of 6 November 1996.\"85 In any case, \"If the Project was in fact \u2018unfeasible' from the beginning, the State of Chile should not have misled MTD by approving MTD's investment application and entering into Foreign Investment Contracts with MTD based on the illusory promise of a housing project in Pirque. If, on the other hand, the Project was not an impossibility, the Respondent should not have rejected MTD's requests for necessary approvals on the pretext that the applicable norms necessarily preclude any urban development in Pirque.\"86\n\nIbid., para. 28.\n\nIbid., para. 12.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants also note that the Counter-Memorial overlooks the description of the Project in the application to the FIC, and, instead, focuses on the capital contribution section. It is clear from the project description section and the Second Clause of the Foreign Investment Contract, which are essentially the same, that the project and its location are clearly identified and the contract states that the purpose of the investment is exclusive and it could only be modified with the prior authorization of FIC.87\n\nIbid., paras. 31-34.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimants address the Respondent's explanation that the specific identification of the project in a foreign investment contract lacks significance and state that: \"No Governmental official told MTD of any such limitation before signing the Foreign Investment Contracts.\" The opinions of the experts submitted with the CounterMemorial and the testimony of Mr. Moyano focus on the fact that a foreign investment contract does not automatically provide all governmental approvals necessary to realize a project, but \"they do not address the different question presented by this case: Whether the state of Chile may properly enter into a binding foreign investment contract that specifies the purposes and location of a particular investment project while, at the same time, knowing (and not telling the investor) that the Government will never allow the investor to carry out the project that is the premise of the contract.\"88\n\nIbid., para. 36.\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimants point out that although the Respondent refused to provide copies of the minutes of the FIC meetings, it did provide records of attendance that show that Ministers who were not permanent members of the FIC attended some meetings, \"presumably to discuss and vote upon foreign investment applications that were relevant to their areas of responsibility, as required by Article 13 of DL 600.\"89 According to the Claimants, if \"the role of the FIC were simply to approve the inflow of funds (as opposed to approving an investment for a particular project), then it would have been unnecessary and illogical for DL 600: (i) to provide that a Minister who is not a permanent member of the FIC is nevertheless a member for purposes of considering applications that are relevant to that Ministry's work; and (ii) to require the Executive Vice President of the FIC to coordinate with other government agencies concerning information and authorizations.\"90 Furthermore, the Respondent is obliged to ensure under article 15(a) of the DL 600 that the FIC coordinates and consults with Ministries concerned. Although requested by the Claimants, the Respondent was not able to find any \"responsive\" documents.91\n\nIbid., para. 41.\n\nIbid., para. 42.\n\nIbid., para. 49.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's position is inconsistent with the availability of other procedures for bringing foreign capital into Chile without signing a foreign investment contract and without necessarily identifying the object and purpose of their investment: \"If the FIC's role were limited to approval of the inflow of funds there would be no need for the FIC, because the Central Bank of Chile already has authority to [sic] the inflow of funds without consideration of the underlying project.\"92 The position of the Respondent is also inconsistent with the terms of the Foreign Investment Contract: \"If the object of the contract were limited to the inflow of funds, the contract would not need to specify the purpose of the investment, or provide that the purpose of the investment can be changed only with the FIC's approval.\"93\n\nIbid., para. 43.\n\nIbid., para. 44.\n\n132.\n\nAs regards Clause Four of the Foreign Investment Contract, the Claimants point out that \"It is one thing to argue that MTD must still satisfy norms and other requirements in the process of realizing the [P]roject - which MTD always understood. It is quite another matter for the Respondent to argue that Clause Fourth [sic] entitled it to approve and accept MTD's investment in Chile while knowing that the premise of the contract could never be realized.\"94\n\nIbid., para. 46.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent has not presented contemporaneous evidence to support the alleged actual reasons for the withdrawal of the speech of the President at the inauguration of the Project: \"If the President's office had \"withdrawn\" the text of a presidential speech that he sent to be read at the inauguration ceremony, it would be reasonable to expect some record of such withdrawal. And if MTD had used a presidential speech without permission, surely the Chilean Government would have taken some action at least to indicate its displeasure. By contrast, the Claimants have submitted to the Tribunal a copy of the fax that they received from the Government with the approved words of President Frei's message.\"95\n\nIbid., para. 58.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimants take issue with the statement of the Respondent that \"the laws and regulations that govern urban planning and development in Chile - and in particular modifications to the PMRS - are simple and transparent.\"96 It is the opinion of the Claimants that contrary to what the Respondent maintains, a sectional plan was an appropriate instrument to modify the PMRS. According to them, this instrument proposed by a municipality is not dependent on the MINVU for its initiation or completion: \"When a sectional plan is filed with the MINVU, the SEREMI is required to analyze the request and forward it to the CORE with a favorable or unfavorable report.\"97\n\nIbid., para. 70.\n\nIbid., para. 71.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants point out that uncertainty and confusion in the urban planning and development are also evident in respect of the recently proposed Modification No. 48 to the PMRS.98 The CORE approved said modification by Resolution No. 14/2003. However, the *Contralor\u00eda General* has refused to accept the legality of the resolution \"ruling that the CORE exceeded its authority by attempting to regulate rural lands located outside of the established urban limits.\"99 The decision has been appealed by CORE..\n\nThis modification of the PMRS permits *Zonas de Desarrollo Urbano Condicionado* in the area South of Santiago that includes Pirque.\n\nReply, para. 72.\n\n136.\n\nIn the opinion of the Claimants, Modification No. 48 contradicts the arguments of the Respondent as regards the uniqueness of Pirque from an environmental point of view: \"It demonstrates that Pirque is not a unique \"key sector\" that must be exempted from urban development to protect the so called \"environmental filter\" of the Santiago metropolitan region.\"100 The Claimants point out that it is striking that \"MINVU chose to submit a *Declaraci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental* (\"DIA\"), which involves a lower level of environmental analysis than an EIS, even though Modification No. 48 would introduce sweeping changes to the use of land throughout the Santiago Metropolitan Region, affecting over 34,000 hectares in comparison with the 600 hectares covered by the Municipality of Pirque's sectional plan. Further, the MINVU's DIA is much more vague and general than the EIS submitted with the sectional plan. Yet, in stark contrast to the way the COREMA treated the EIS submitted by the Municipality of Pirque, the COREMA concluded, after evaluating the DIA submitted by MINVU, that the proposed modification of the PMRS would not generate any relevant adverse environmental impacts.\"101\n\nIbid., para. 84.\n\nIbid., para. 85.\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimants consider \"disingenuous\" the argument put forward by the Respondent to the effect that the Claimants should have requested an amendment of the PMRS instead of designing a sectional plan \"because the Respondent made clear that it would not allow realization of the Project *under any procedure*. MTD and the Municipality of Pirque attempted the procedure of a sectional plan only after the MINVU indicated that it would not initiate such a change itself and the Respondent, through the MINVU, declined repeatedly to provide any guidance regarding the proper procedures to be followed to modify the PMRS.\"102\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants cannot excuse their failure to comply with the law by alleging ignorance of the law. The law was clear, the plot of land in the Fundo El Principal was exclusively for *silvoagropecuario* use and the foreign investment contracts grant investors only the authorizations provided therein.103 Referring to the cases decided by other arbitral tribunals relied on by the Claimants, the Respondent affirms that \"[i]n contrast, MTD *never had any right to carry out its Project*, which was always contingent on the obtaining of the relevant authorizations by means of the procedure established by law. MTD did not understand or did not want to understand the regulations in force, choosing instead to follow procedures clearly contrary to the law.\"104\n\nRejoinder, paras. 5-7.\n\nIbid., para. 9.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the two communications of 1998 that refer to the November 6, 1996 meeting \"were prepared and sent before any controversy existed between MTD and the Government, which thus belying [sic] MTD's argument that this meeting has been fabricated by the Government.\"105 The Respondent also addresses the Claimants' assertion that they did not receive any warning regarding the feasibility of their investment project before signing the Foreign Investment Contract and that if \"MTD had been told in 1996 that the Project was not feasible, it would never have invested in the Project.\" The Respondent comments that \"this argument is based on an erroneous assumption that the Government of Chile had the obligation to warn MTD about the feasibility of its project before it invested. In fact, it was MTD that had the obligation to obtain the necessary information regarding the legal and technical feasibility of its project. This is particularly true, given that this information was public, transparent, and readily available.\"106 The Respondent points out the failure of the Claimants to mention that, \"under the legislation in force at that time, it was possible, though difficult and not guaranteed, to obtain a modification of the PMRS, and that MTD tried to obtain such a modification by means of an erroneous procedure that necessarily led to its rejection.\"107\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\nIbid., para. 30.\n\nIbid., para. 36.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent rebuts the argument that their officials were unresponsive to the Claimants' requests for assistance. In fact, \"Due to the evident lack of competence of MTD's consultants, Mr. Carvacho and Mr. Leppe offered to assist the company by guiding them through the steps necessary to attempt a modification of the PMRS, but MTD never took them up on this offer.\"108\n\nIbid., para. 69.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent reaffirms that it had no obligation to modify the PMRS and to allow the Project to proceed. Every step taken by the Respondent's officials was taken in accordance to the law, including the rejection of the Sectional Plan. Sectional plans cannot alter or modify the norm established by instruments of a higher hierarchy and the modification of the PMRS was inconvenient because the MINVU SEREMI was undertaking the study of the Regional Plan of Urban Development (\"PRDU\"). As explained by the Respondent, \"The PRDU is the urban planning instrument that establishes the roles of the urban centers, their gravitational areas of reciprocal influence, gravitational relations, and growth targets, among others.\"109 The study of PRDU for the Santiago Metropolitan Region had began in 1994 after the entry into force of the PMRS, and \"it was being analyzed in 1998.\"110\n\nIbid., para. 83.\n\nIbid.\n\n142.\n\nThe contention that, according to Chilean law, the SEREMI had an obligation to forward the sectional plan to the CORE contradicts the LGUC which establishes the legal procedure for the elaboration of the norms of the PMRS, \"what the CORE approved or rejected was a proposal of the SEREMI and not a proposal of any other agency. The CORE did not have the power to consider or approve planning proposals of any other entities, including the sectional plans presented by the municipalities.\"111\n\nRejoinder, para. 75.\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent admits that \"Chilean urban planning regulations are complex, given their highly technical nature, but they are comprehensible, a diligent investor would require competent professional assistance, as would a domestic investor.\"112 In any case, the Respondent argues that \"complexity neither excuses MTD's negligence nor justifies MTD's attempts to circumvent the legally established procedures. MTD never followed these procedures but rather chose to evade them. MTD presented a Sectional Plan, through the Municipality of Pirque, to modify the provisions of the PMRS, even though it was well informed that [sic] procedure was contrary to the regulations in force.\"113\n\nIbid., para. 93.\n\nIbid.\n\n144.\n\nRespondent defends Modification No. 48 as proof of the evolution of the urban planning framework in Santiago: \"Land use regulation and the policies adopted in these matters in the Santiago Metropolitan Area can evolve over time. That evolution is carried out within a transparent administrative system, which mandates consultation with, and approval of, multiple government agencies [...] All the modifications [between 1997 and 2002] were the result of the procedures established under Chilean law and sought the public welfare of all the population.\"114\n\nIbid., para. 95.\n\n145.\n\nChile argues that \"The fact that the General Finance office of the Republic115 has formulated observations to the resolution [sic] approves [sic] that Modification No. 48 does not demonstrate to the \u2018uncertainty and confusion related to the rules governing development and urban planning in Chile, [\u2026] it demonstrates the functioning of the administrative regime and the Chilean democracy, and that the mere fact that the authority proposes modifications to the norm is no guarantee they will be implemented. This does not imply arbitrary conduct, but the normal process of creation of standards under a democratic and transparent system.\"116\n\n*Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica*.\n\nRejoinder, para. 96.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is wrong to characterize Modification No. 48 as a means to allow large-scale urban development in the area of Pirque. The Respondent maintains that \"MTD diminishes the impact of the conditions imposed on the development of new projects. In fact, Modification No. 48 would eventually allow the implementation of Conditional Urban Development Projects, only after the fulfillment of much stricter requirements than those previously imposed on any other housing project in the Santiago Metropolitan Area; the projects would have to be subjected to feasibility studies regarding basic conditions of location, size and profile of the proposal. These studies would be carried out by the municipalities where the project is located, by the SEREMI of Agriculture and the SEREMI of Housing. Subsequently, with the unanimous approval of those three agencies, the project would enter a technical evaluation phase by the SEREMI of Housing, which would have to determine if seven determinant conditions are fulfilled...the mere fulfillment of the requirements established in Modification No. 48 would not authorize the modification of land use.\"117\n\nIbid., paras. 99-100.\n\n147.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is clear that Modification No. 48 would make it more difficult for large-scale real estate projects to be carried out in areas currently outside urban limits, since, as the Respondent explains, they \"would have to go through two different and consecutive stages: *first,* they will have to fulfill the new requirements established in Modification No. 48 and, *second*, they will have to abide by the rules currently in place for PMRS modification. Between 1996 and 1998, however, MTD would only have had to fulfill this second stage.\"118\n\nIbid., para. 101.\n\n148.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Chile re-affirms its right to require that MTD comply with Chilean environmental and urban planning regulations. The Project \"constituted an inappropriate attempt to use a Sectional Plan to modify the land use restrictions established by the PMRS for that Municipality\". This was correctly pointed out by the COREMA and \"under article 16 of the General Law on the Environment, *COREMA had the obligation to reject it**.*\"119\n\nIbid., para. 105.\n\n149.\n\nFrom these allegations, three key issues emerge: the significance of the November 6, 1996 meeting, the scope of the approval by the FIC, and the conduct of the Claimants as diligent investors. The Tribunal will now consider them in that sequence.\n\n***(iii) The November 6, 1996 meeting***\n----------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent has attributed particular importance to the meeting allegedly held with \"Malaysian businessmen\" on November 6, 1996 in order to show the reckless behavior of the Claimants in proceeding to invest notwithstanding warnings of the obstacles that their investment would face. The Claimants contest that such meeting ever took place. As proof of that meeting, there is the word \"Malaysia\" in the calendar of Minister Hermosilla and reference made to the meeting in two documents of the Respondent dated two years later. There are no briefings prior to the meeting, nor written record of what was discussed, nor any contemporaneous written record of who attended the meeting. Neither Minister Hermosilla nor SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez could determine whether any of the MTD representatives who attended the hearings in Washington were one of the \"Malaysian businessmen\" that allegedly attended the November 6, 1996 meeting.\n\n151.\n\nThis notwithstanding, the Respondent has described in considerable detail the terms of the exchanges that took place at such meeting in the Counter-Memorial and the Rejoinder and so did Messrs. Hermosilla and Gonz\u00e1lez in their testimony. The Malaysian representatives of the Claimants, except for Mr. Lee, have presented their passports as proof that none of them was in Chile at the time. Mr. Lee lost his passport, but he was present at the Washington hearings when Messrs. Hermosilla and Gonz\u00e1lez testified.\n\n152.\n\nGiven the factual controversy surrounding this meeting, the Tribunal will analyze the situation with and without the meeting and to what extent the conduct of the parties is consequent with the statements allegedly made by Chilean officials and the Claimants' representatives.\n\n153.\n\nThe alleged meeting of November 6, 1996 is one of many meetings that took place before and after that date between representatives of the Claimants and Chilean Government officials. Representatives of the Claimants met with Mr. Morales of the FIC on May 16 and with Mr. Guerra of SERVIU on May 17, 1996. The timing of the November 6 meeting coincides with the resumption during that month of negotiations of MTD, through the firm Vial & Palma, with Mr. Fontaine, which led to the signature of the Promissory Contract on November 21, 1996. Hence, the importance attributed to the meeting by the Respondent to show that the Claimants had been warned about the existing difficulties to build the Project by Chilean officials at the highest level and at an early stage of the Claimants' decision-making on the Project.\n\n154.\n\nAccording to the Counter-Memorial, \"Upon hearing that MTD had selected Pirque as the location for its Project, SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez informed Minister Hermosilla that the Project was not feasible. Minister Hermosilla conveyed this point to MTD, explaining that the PMRS, which categorically forbade urban development in Pirque, posed a serious impediment to the Project. He added that the PMRS could not be circumvented and that the only way to develop a real estate project in Pirque was by modifying the PMRS.\"120 Allegedly, the process for modifying the PMRS was explained to the Claimants at their own request. SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez, \"the official with sole authority to initiate the modification process,\"121 explained that \"because the Project was inconsistent with the goals of the PMRS, one of which was to promote urban densification, the office of the SEREMI would not be able to sponsor the project before CORE.\"122 Mr. Hermosilla also suggested that \"MTD find an alternative location for its Project.\"123\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 25.\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n155.\n\nThis record of the meeting provided by the Respondent will be considered by the Tribunal in the context of the subsequent conduct of the parties.\n\n156.\n\nThe FIC approved the first request of the Claimants for foreign investment related to the Project on March 3, 1997. On March 18, 1997, the corresponding Foreign Investment Contract was signed. A second request for investment was approved by the FIC on April 8, 1997 and another Foreign Investment Contract signed on May 13, 1997. On September 29, 1997, the President of Chile at a state dinner in honor of the Prime Minister of Malaysia praised the Project as innovative and \"a tangible demonstration that people may fully profit from the favorable conditions that the governments are creating\". Then the next day the office of the President of Chile sent a public statement in similar terms to be read at the ceremony to inaugurate the Project in Pirque after canceling his appearance because of a meeting with the President of Brazil.\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the statement of the President intended to be read at the inauguration had been officially withdrawn. There is no evidence of such withdrawal nor of any disclaimer to this effect after the statement was actually read at the inauguration. It is also claimed now by the Respondent that the President cancelled his attendance at the inauguration at the request of the new Minister of MINVU, Mr. Henr\u00edquez, and that the actual reason for the cancellation of the President's attendance was that: \"Having learned of the difficulties that MTD's project faced and of the warnings that his predecessor had imparted to MTD, Minister Henr\u00edquez believed that President Frei's presence at the ceremony could be misinterpreted, and therefore urged the President not to attend.\"124 It is undisputed that the Claimants were not informed at the time of the real reason for the cancellation of the President's appearance or the alleged withdrawal of his statement. They have apparently learned about it during the course of these proceedings. Given that President Frei spoke at the state dinner only the evening before, there was no reason to suspect that there were other reasons for the cancellation of the President's appearance. The Respondent does not seem to have acted in accordance with the allegedly clear warnings given to representatives of the Claimants on November 6, 1996.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 59.\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants' own actions contradict also the allegation of what was said at the November 6 meeting assuming that it took place. Irrespective of the inconsequent business decisions taken notwithstanding the alleged clear warnings of the Respondent, a matter to which the Tribunal will turn later, the Claimants, in their dealings with Mr. Fontaine, sought protection in respect of the approval of their investment by the FIC. They conditioned the taking effect of the Promissory Contract to the FIC's approval of the transfer of funds. It would seem reasonable to assume that, if the statements made to them by Minister Hermosilla and SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez had been as clear as alleged, the Claimants would have protected themselves accordingly by looking for another site or canceling the proposed investment altogether. It would have been equally inconsequential for the Claimants to seek the FIC's approval for an investment considered unfeasible by high level officials of the Respondent. The Tribunal will have further to say about the Claimants' diligence.\n\n159.\n\nThe scope of the approval of the first two investments of the Claimants by the FIC is a key element in the consideration of whether the Respondent fulfilled its obligation to treat the Claimants fairly and equitably and the Tribunal will turn to this question now. At this point, the Tribunal is only concerned with the actual approval of the inflow of funds for the Project and with the fact that Chile entered into the Foreign Investment Contracts with the Claimants. The Tribunal will discuss later the claim that Chile breached the Foreign Investment Contracts and, by operation of the MFN clause, the BIT.\n\n***(iv) Significance of the Approval of the FIC***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe parties disagree on the meaning of the approval of the investment by the FIC under DL 600 and the significance of the absence of the Minister responsible for the sector of the proposed investment from the meeting where the investment was approved. Chile maintains that approval by the FIC does not mean more than an authorization to import funds into the country. The description of the project in the application to the FIC is too brief for it to be significant to the approval of the investment and it would be, in any case, beyond the scope of the FIC's authority to attribute to its approval any other meaning.\n\n161.\n\nAccording to Chile, who attends the meeting of the FIC is not important provided there is a quorum for the meeting and the provisions of DL 600 do not require that the sector Minister concerned be part of the quorum. In fact, according to the Respondent, the practice of the FIC is that the sector Ministers do not attend the FIC meetings except in the case of some sectors, e.g. mining, and that the documents related to an investment are not distributed to the sector Ministers before a FIC meeting nor is notice of the meeting sent to the non-permanent members of the FIC. In any case, argues Chile, even if the Minister of MINVU had attended, the outcome would have been the same given the limited role that the FIC plays. On the other hand, the Claimants consider the approval of the FIC to be the approval of the investment and of the Project at the described location, and to give them the right to develop the site. They attribute to the absence of the Minister of MINVU from the meeting of the FIC that approved the Project, the subsequent obstacles against which otherwise they would have been alerted.\n\n162.\n\nDL 600 confers on the FIC the power to approve on behalf of \"the Chilean State the inflow of foreign capital under this Decree-Law and to stipulate the terms and conditions of the corresponding contracts\" (Article 12). The FIC members are all at the ministerial level except for the president of the Central Bank (Article 13). Decisions are taken by simple majority and a quorum for a meeting requires only the presence of any three members (Article 14). In order for the FIC to exercise its functions, the Executive Vice-Presidency is responsible, *inter alia*, for the coordination of foreign investments and to carry out and expedite the procedures required by public institutions that must report or grant their authorization prior to the approval of the applications submitted to the FIC (Article 15). The applications require the investor to specify the location of the investment and the requirement is repeated in the non-negotiable standard foreign investment contract. It is this contract that, in terms of DL 600, evidences the authorization of the FIC (Article 3). A change in the location of the investment would require a change in the contract and hence, the approval of the FIC.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the ministerial membership of the FIC is by itself proof of the importance that Chile attributes to its function, and it is consequent with the objective to coordinate foreign investment at the highest level of the Ministries concerned. It is also evident from the DL 600 that the FIC is required to carry out a minimum of diligence internally and externally. Approval of a Project in a location would give *prima facie* to an investor the expectation that the project is feasible in that location from a regulatory point of view. The practice whereby the non-permanent member of the FIC is not notified of the FIC meetings and no information is distributed to the Minister concerned prior to the meetings, when followed consistently, may impair seriously the coordination function of the FIC. This is not to say that approval of a project in a particular location entitles the investor to develop that site without further governmental approval. The Foreign Investment Contracts are clear in that respect and this matter is dealt with separately in this award. What the Tribunal emphasizes here is the inconsistency of action between two arms of the same Government *vis-\u00e0-vis* the same investor even when the legal framework of the country provides for a mechanism to coordinate. This is even more so, if, as affirmed by the Respondent, the presence of the MINVU Minister in the FIC meeting where the investment was approved would not have made a difference.\n\n164.\n\nChile has argued that each organ of the Government has certain responsibilities, that it is not its function to carry out due diligence regarding the legal and technical feasibility of a project for investors, and that this is the investors' responsibility. The Tribunal agrees that it is the responsibility of the investor to assure itself that it is properly advised, particularly when investing abroad in an unfamiliar environment. However, in the case before us, Chile is not a passive party and the coherent action of the various officials through which Chile acts is the responsibility of Chile, not of the investor. Whether the Claimants acted responsibly or diligently in reaching a decision to invest in Chile is another question.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants contacted officials of the Respondent from the very beginning in May 1996. It is only in June 1998, almost two years after the supposed November 6, 1996 meeting, that the SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez informed the Claimants in writing about the policy against changing the zoning of El Principal and modifying the PMRS, and Minister Henr\u00edquez rejected the Project. Chile claims that it had no obligation to inform the Claimants and that the Claimants should have found out by themselves what the regulations and policies of the country were. The Tribunal agrees with this statement as a matter of principle, but Chile also has an obligation to act coherently and apply its policies consistently, independently of how diligent an investor is. Under international law (the law that this Tribunal has to apply to a dispute under the BIT), the State of Chile needs to be considered by the Tribunal as a unit.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied, based on the evidence presented to it, that approval of an investment by the FIC for a project that is against the urban policy of the Government is a breach of the obligation to treat an investor fairly and equitably. In this respect, whether the meeting of November 6, 1996 took place or not does not affect the outcome of these considerations. In fact, if it did take place, it is even more inexplicable that the FIC would approve the investment and the first two Foreign Investment Contracts would be signed. Minister Hermosilla and the FIC were different channels of communication of the Respondent with outside parties, but, for purposes of the obligations of Chile under the BIT, they represented Chile as a unit, as a monolith, to use the Respondent's term.\n\n167.\n\nThis conclusion of the Tribunal does not mean that Chile is responsible for the consequences of unwise business decisions or for the lack of diligence of the investor. Its responsibility is limited to the consequences of its own actions to the extent they breached the obligation to treat the Claimants fairly and equitably. The Tribunal will now address the alleged Claimants' lack of diligence and of prudent business judgment raised by the Respondent.\n\n***(v) The issue of the Claimants' diligence***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe lack of diligence of the Claimants alleged by the Respondent rests on the trust placed in Mr. Fontaine, the lack of adequate professional advice in the urban sector and the acceptance of an exorbitant land valuation at the time they made the investment.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants decided to invest in Chile without conducting meaningful due diligence. They relied on self-serving statements of Mr. Fontaine that the land was unproductive and could be readily re-zoned, \"particularly if it would attract foreign investment.\"125 If the Claimants had made \"even the most rudimentary of inquiries\" they would have learned that Pirque actually possesses high-quality agricultural land and plays an important role in the environmental health of the Metropolitan Region. They would have also learned about the PMRS adopted just two years earlier which \"expressly prohibited urban development in Pirque and designated it as an exclusive *silvoagropecuario* zone.\"126 The Respondent finds it striking that the two-man team of the Claimants arrived at its favorable recommendation to invest in Chile after only four days in the country, particularly when it is considered that the investment in El Principal \"appears to have been MTD's first venture outside of Southeast Asia.\"127\n\nIbid., para. 8.\n\nIbid., para. 9.\n\nIbid., paras. 9 and 11.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent contrasts the practices of the Claimants with those followed by diligent foreign investors. Normally, \"foreign investors routinely seek contractual protections against losses arising from difficulties in obtaining governmental authorizations by incorporating related representations and warranties, covenants, conditions precedent or subsequent, or other protective provisions\".128 The Claimants proceeded to enter into the Promissory Contract \"despite a cursory understanding of Chile's foreign investment laws, a flawed land appraisal, warnings from government officials regarding land use issues, and apparently no additional professional advice regarding the risks inherent to its proposed development of a satellite city on land restricted to urban development.\"129\n\nIbid., para. 29.\n\nIbid.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent draws attention to other arbitral awards not mentioned in Judge Schwebel's opinion. The Respondent refers to the need of an arbitral tribunal to take into account, quoting from the award in *American Manufacturing & Trading v. Republic of Zaire*, the \"existing conditions of the [host] country\"130 when applying the standards of a bilateral investment treaty: \"In Chile, zoning modifications, such as those required for the PMRS, involve a lengthy administrative process -a process that Chilean Government officials explained to MTD at length.\"131 The Respondent also refers to *Azinian132* to emphasize that the Claimants, like the claimants in that case, were \"alien to the host State's business environment, had not secured the resources and services needed to implement the Project, and had not commissioned \"any feasibility study worth the name.\"133\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, 36 I.L.M. 1531, at 1553 (1997).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 109.\n\n*Robert Azinian et al. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID (AF) Case N. ARB (AF)97/2, ICSID REV. -Foreign INV. L.J. 538 (1999).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 111.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the Claimants accepted as true the representations made by Mr. Fontaine that the land use restrictions on the Fundo El Principal could be modified and did not carry any further investigation to verify their validity.134 They also accepted the valuation of the land done by Banco Sud Americano on the assumption that the land would be re-zoned for urban use and without specific identification of the 600 hectare plot that the Claimants were interested in buying.135\n\nRejoinder, para. 14.\n\nIbid., paras. 24-25.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the assumptions underlying the valuation of Mr. Fontaine's land done by Banco Sud Americano. In the first place, the valuation ignored the limitations imposed by the PMRS and \"the appraisers assumed, without any analysis or explanation, that the land in El Principal would be re-zoned for urban use.\" According to the Respondent, had the Claimants made \"even the most primitive attempt to conduct reasonable due diligence and consult with any urban planner, environmental expert, architect, or, at the very least, a lawyer experienced in real estate development issues, the erroneous nature of the appraisal's re-zoning assumption would have been imparted to MTD's representatives.\"136\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 20.\n\n174.\n\nThe appraisal also assumed that the road known as the Paseo Pie Andino would be built within five years, and \"improperly suggested that the mere proposal of the unrealized Project raised the value of the land and erroneously assumed that the land could be divided into \"*parcelas de agrado*\" of 0.5 hectares.\" In fact, after the passage of the PMRS, the minimum subdivision possible was four hectares.137\n\nIbid., para. 22.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimants decided on the value of the land only on the basis of that appraisal without considering the specific value of the 600 hectares that would be the basis of the initial investment, or how the value of the land was affected by the existing road system, or applicable zoning restrictions. According to the Respondent, if a more \"exacting land appraisal\" had been conducted, the Claimants, would have discovered that the value of the 600-hectare area proposed for development under the Project was between US$ 4.1 and US$ 4.6 million.138\n\nIbid., para. 23.\n\n176.\n\nIt is clear from the record that no specialist in urban development was contacted by the Claimants until the deal had been closed. The firms contacted thereafter, to the extent that there is a contemporary written record, do not seem to have been as clear as they are now in their testimony about the difficulty of changing the zoning. The only thing that emerges with certainty is that the Claimants were in a hurry to start the Project.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants apparently did not appreciate the fact that Mr. Fontaine may have had a conflict of interest with the Claimants for purposes of developing El Principal. He played lightly to them the significance of the zoning changes and they seem to have accepted at first hand Mr. Fontaine's judgment. The price paid for the land was based on the Project going ahead and it was paid up-front without any link to the progress of the Project.\n\n178.\n\nThe BITs are not an insurance against business risk139 and the Tribunal considers that the Claimants should bear the consequences of their own actions as experienced businessmen. Their choice of partner, the acceptance of a land valuation based on future assumptions without protecting themselves contractually in case the assumptions would not materialize, including the issuance of the required development permits, are risks that the Claimants took irrespective of Chile's actions.\n\n\"the Tribunal must emphasize that Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad business judgments.\" *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 para. 69.\n\n**2. Breach of the BIT by Breach of the Foreign Investment Contracts**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's failure to observe its contractual obligations, \"constitutes a breach of its treaty obligation to observe the contractual obligations it undertook regarding MTD's investment. Because the breach at issue is a breach of an international obligation, the matter is governed, first and foremost, by international law. To the extent that the issue turns on the scope of the obligations arising out of the Foreign Investment Contracts, the Contract must be interpreted in accordance with its plain language and the general principles of contract law, in keeping with the internationalization of contract obligations [...] This conclusion is particularly relevant in this case, because the Foreign Investment Contracts do not contain a choice-of-law clause.\"140\n\nReply, para. 104.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize the fact that the Foreign Investment Contracts were contracts of adhesion because their terms were not negotiable.141 The location of the Project in Pirque was \"a fundamental assumption of the bargain between MTD and the State of Chile. MTD had a right to that location, and the State of Chile had a correlative obligation to take such steps as might be necessary to permit the use of that location for the development of the Project. The State of Chile breached that obligation by blocking the development of the Project on the ground that it was to be located in the very place designated in the Contracts.\"142 The refusal of the Respondent to re-zone the area concerned \"frustrated the rights and legitimate expectations of MTD under the Foreign Investment Contracts and treated the entire Foreign Investment Application procedure as an empty formality.\"143\n\nMemorial, para. 109.\n\nIbid., para. 110.\n\nIbid.\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the approval of the investment in Pirque has the effect of approving the location of the Project and that the reference in clause Four of the Foreign Investment Contracts to \"other\" authorizations refers to authorizations other than those granted in the Foreign Investment Contracts themselves: \"it would be the height of bad faith to construe Clause Fourth [sic] as giving the State of Chile the power to destroy the basis of the bargain by erasing, after the fact, the very object of the investment as specified in the Contracts.\"144\n\nIbid., para. 111.\n\n182.\n\nAs regards the obligation to grant the necessary permits for an authorized investment, the Claimants affirm that \"the Respondent is obligated *under the Treaty* to grant the necessary permits to the extent that doing so is *consistent* with its laws and regulations. The Respondent cannot seriously contend that modifying the PMRS to permit large-scale urban development project in Pirque would have been inconsistent with Chilean laws and regulations, for that is precisely what the Respondent is trying to do, on a far larger scale, through Modification No. 48.\"145\n\nReply, para. 117.\n\n183.\n\nChile argues that, even if Article 3(1) of the BIT between Chile and Denmark were applicable, it has not been proven by the Claimants that Chile has violated its obligations under that provision and \"under international law, the violation of a contract does not suppose an *ipso facto* violation of an international treaty.\"146\n\nRejoinder, para. 126.\n\n184.\n\nChile considers that it has complied with its obligations under the Foreign Investment Contracts and that the mere mention of El Principal in the Foreign Investment Contracts did not grant the Claimants an unfettered right to develop the Project in that location. The authorization granted by the FIC under DL 600 is only an authorization to transfer capital and it is without prejudice and independent from other authorizations that may be required under Chilean law. Foreign investors have no right to a preferential treatment *vis-\u00e0-vis* local investors: \"Just as a domestic investor cannot obtain a waiver of the PMRS by executive fiat, neither could MTD.\"147\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 124.\n\n185.\n\nBased on statements made by Chile in the Counter-Memorial, the Claimants point out that the Respondent refused \"*for reasons of \u2018inconvenience'\"* even \"to consider taking the administrative actions necessary to permit urban development on the piece of land designated in the Contracts, a result that was entirely in its power and discretion to achieve [...] To this it may now be added that, under the Respondent's own version of the facts, the State of Chile entered into Foreign Investment Contracts *with the intent that it would not allow the Project to be built in Pirque.*\"148\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants contest that the scope of the Foreign Investment Contracts is governed by Chilean law and that under that law the FIC did not have \"the capacity or authority to approve the nature and location of the investment project\".149 The Claimants state that \"Under basic principles of international law, the State of Chile may not evade its international responsibility by invoking any alleged insufficiency in the authority of the organ through which it acted.\"150 The Claimants also contest the argument that DL 600 guarantees treatment as a national investor and that they would have received better treatment if authorization of the investment and the Foreign Investment Contract would have given them the right to the modification of the PMRS. The Claimants argue that, under the BIT, they are \"entitled to certain standards of treatment even if the State of Chile chooses not to extend the same treatment to its own national investors [...] [L]ocal investors are not eligible to enter into foreign investment contracts and hence cannot receive any of the special guarantees or advantages that DL 600 authorizes [\u2026] [T]he principle of non-discrimination under Article 9 of DL 600 protects foreign investors from *worse* treatment than that accorded to national investors; it does not prevent them from receiving the benefits provided in the foreign investment contracts.\"151\n\nIbid., para. 107.\n\nIbid., para. 108.\n\nIbid., para. 109.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the legal basis of the claim valid based on the wide scope of the MFN clause in the BIT, as already discussed. The Tribunal notes the statement of the Respondent that under international law the breach of a contractual obligation is not *ipso facto* a breach of a treaty. Under the BIT, by way of the MFN clause, this is what the parties had agreed. The Tribunal has to apply the BIT. The breach of the BIT is governed by international law. However, to establish the facts of the breach, it will be necessary to consider the contractual obligations undertaken by the Respondent and the Claimants and what their scope was under Chilean law.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Chile treated unfairly and inequitably the Claimants by authorizing an investment that could not take place for reasons of its urban policy. The Claimants have based their arguments on the fact that \"the location of the Project was a fundamental assumption of the bargain between MTD and the State of Chile. MTD had a right to that location, and the State of Chile had a correlative obligation to take such steps as might be necessary to permit the use of that location for the development of the Project.\"152 The Tribunal accepts that the authorization to invest in Chile is not a blanket authorization but only the initiation of a process to obtain the necessary permits and approvals from the various agencies and departments of the Government. It also accepts that the Government has to proceed in accordance with its own laws and policies in awarding such permits and approvals. Clause Four of the Foreign Investment Contracts would be meaningless if it were otherwise. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Chile did not breach the BIT on account of breach of the Foreign Investment Contracts.\n\nMemorial, para. 110.\n\n189.\n\nAs already discussed under fair and equitable treatment, what is unacceptable for the Tribunal is that an investment would be approved for a particular location specified in the application and the subsequent contract when the objective of the investment is against the policy of the Government. Even accepting the limited significance of the Foreign Investment Contracts for purposes of other permits and approvals that may required, they should be at least in themselves an indication that, from the Government's point of view, the Project is not against Government policy.\n\n**3. Unreasonable and Discriminatory Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe argument of the Claimants regarding unreasonable and discriminatory measures is based on Article 3(3) of the Croatia BIT. This Article provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and liquidation of such investments.\"\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the unfair and inequitable measures described earlier are also unreasonable and that the Respondent's \"refusal to re-zone the El Principal Estate in Pirque to permit construction of the Project is discriminatory because the State of Chile has permitted construction of other large-scale real-estate projects in the Chacabuco area, north of Santiago.\"153\n\nMemorial, para. 115.\n\n192.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants maintain that the acceptance and approval of an environmental impact declaration (DIA) by COREMA in support of Modification No. 48 \"illustrates the State of Chile's unreasonable and discriminatory treatment of the EIS submitted by the Municipality of Pirque in support of the proposed Sectional Plan.\"154\n\nReply, para. 115.\n\n193.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of the modifications to the PMRS referred to by the Claimants were achieved through sectional plans and followed the standard PMRS modification procedure. Furthermore, Modification No. 48 \"will make the completion of large real estate projects more - rather than less - difficult in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago.\"155\n\nRejoinder, paras. 5-7.\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent finds also inadmissible the comparison of the EIS with the DIA prepared for Modification No. 48. An EIS is only required by the existing environmental regulation when projects entail significant environmental impacts.156 In contrast to the environmental consequences of the Project, \"Modification No. 48 would not generate direct impacts on the environment, it would set out conditions for the development of future Urban Conditional Development Projects\". Projects presented under Modification No. 48 will still need an EIS and satisfy \"a *more demanding* environmental evaluation than that applied to the Sectional Plan for Pirque.\"157\n\nIbid., para. 108.\n\nIbid., paras. 110-111.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent explains the justification given by COREMA to reject the EIS. First of all, the COREMA followed the prescribed procedure. It accepted the EIS for review within five days of receipt because *prima facie* there were no evident administrative errors. The next step was to consult with other Government agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters. This is what COREMA did in the case of MTD's EIS. COREMA issued a negative evaluation regarding the substance of the EIS only after \"consulting with other agencies about the environmental impacts of MTD's Project.\"158 The Project was inconsistent with the PMRS, which for purposes of evaluating an environmental impact study is considered an environmental regulation, and, hence, the Project failed to comply with environmental regulations. The EIS also failed to address identified environmental obstacles and was extremely vague.159\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 153.\n\nIbid., para. 154.\n\n196.\n\nTo a certain extent, this claim has been considered by the Tribunal as part of the fair and equitable treatment. The approval of an investment against the Government urban policy can be equally considered unreasonable. On the other hand, the changes of the PMRS related to Chacabuco or more recently Modification 48, as explained by the Respondent, do not dispense with specific changes of the PMRS when the land is zoned of \"*silvoagropecuario* interest\". Therefore, there is no basis for considering the modifications made to PMRS as discriminatory. The Tribunal is also satisfied by the explanation regarding the rejection of the EIS by COREMA.\n\n**4. Failure to Grant Necessary Permits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThis claim is based on the Croatia BIT by way of the MFN clause of the BIT. Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT reads as follows: \"When a Contracting Party has admitted an investment in its territory, it shall grant the necessary permits in accordance with its laws and regulations.\"\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants consider that this \"clause obligates the State, once the investment is approved, to grant the necessary permits to the investor, in accordance with the country's laws and regulations.\"160 And further, \"At the very minimum, this provision obligates the [S]tate of Chile to grant to MTD such permits as may be necessary to cover those aspects of the investment that were specifically considered by the [S]tate in admitting the investment. Accordingly, if a formal re-zoning permit is required for the development of the Project and if that permit can only take the form of an amendment of the PMRS, the [S]tate of Chile is required by the quoted provision [Article 3(2)] to grant such permit by adopting such an amendment to the PMRS.\"161\n\nMemorial, para. 118.\n\nIbid., para. 119.\n\n199.\n\nWhile the Claimants realize that permits must be granted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State and that the PMRS is one such regulation, they consider that, to use such reasoning, misses the point: \"It is the modification of the PMRS - which is entirely within the State of Chile's discretion - that is at issue here. There is nothing in the State of Chile's laws or regulations that would prevent the [S]tate of Chile from modifying the PMRS to allow the Project to be fulfilled [\u2026] The State of Chile refused to make such modification not because it lacked the power to do so, but because it chose not to do it for reasons of policy. Any interpretation that allowed the State to do just that would turn the treaty obligation to grant necessary permits for an approved investment into a dead letter.\"162 On the other hand, when Chile had the will to modify the PMRS, it found a way to justify it.\n\nIbid., para. 120.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent dismisses the Claimants' statement that no legal norm prevented Chile from modifying the PMRS to allow the carrying out of the Project.163 If the argument presented by the Claimants were correct, it would \"render meaningless that clause of the Chile-Croatia Treaty and the Foreign Investment Contracts - clauses found in countless other bilateral investment treaties and foreign investment contract worldwide - requiring foreign investors to comply with domestic laws and regulations.\"164 Under such theory, \"a foreign investor would be able [sic] circumvent the PMRS modification process, while domestic investors could not - a result that would contravene the nondiscrimination provision of DL 600.\"165\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 143.\n\nIbid., para. 144.\n\nIbid., para. 145.\n\n201.\n\nAs to the modifications made to the PMRS, the Respondent affirms that they reflect minor changes that underscore the firm commitment of Chile to respect this instrument. The most significant modification of land use involved re-designating land at La Platina from Ecological Preservation to a Complementary Green Area to allow the construction of a zoological park. The modification introduced by Resolution 39 in 1997 incorporated new lands in the PMRS rather than changed the use of land already in the PMRS, the municipalities of Colina, Lampa and Til-Til in the Province of Chacabuco. Furthermore, \"The incorporation of Chacabuco [...] was wholly consistent with the original purpose of the PMRS, which was to allow urban development in Santiago's north, where Chacabuco is located, rather than in the southeast, where Pirque is located.\"166 Chile does not deny that it can change the PMRS but asserts that it is not obliged to do so, \"[t]he simple fact that the PMRS *could* be modified did not mean that MTD was *entitled* to its proposed modification.\"167\n\nIbid., paras. 147-149.\n\nIbid., para. 150.\n\n202.\n\nChile points out that it is an unexplained indictment of the Claimants that Chile adhered to its urban planning policy: Chile - like any other sovereign State - has the power to establish its policies. In fact, it is a Government's *raison d'\u00eatre* to enact laws that reflect policy choices. MTD was aware of Chile's policy before it purchased El Principal and has \"no credibility to decry that policy now and argue -without support - that Chile was somehow automatically obligated as a matter of law to change a policy benefiting the millions of residents of [sic] Metropolitan Region.\"168\n\nIbid., para. 151.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent contests the argument that it failed to give the necessary permits and hence it violated Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT: \"Even assuming that article 3(2) [\u2026] is applicable to the present case, Chile has not violated that obligation. Chile has demonstrated that the actions of its officials were not carried for [sic] for extra-legal reasons such as the particular preferences or whims of government officials.\"169 The permits needed for the Project, as found by the tribunal in *TECMED* in interpreting a similar provision, need to be granted in accordance with the laws of the State concerned,170 and there is no merit to the contention of the Claimants that, \"Because the breach at issue is a breach of an international obligation, the matter is governed, first and foremost, by international law.\"171\n\nRejoinder, para. 130.\n\n*Environmental Techniques TECMED S.A. v. the Mexican United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Decision of May 29.2003.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 131-132.\n\n204.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the legal basis of the claim valid based on the wide scope of the MFN clause in the BIT, as already discussed. The Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent's statement that there is no merit to the contention of the Claimants that, if there is a breach of an international obligation, \"the matter is governed, first and foremost, by international law\". The breach of an international obligation will need, by definition, to be judged in terms of international law. To establish the facts of the breach, it may be necessary to take into account municipal law. In the instant case, the Tribunal will need to establish first whether the Respondent's failure to modify the PMRS to the benefit of the Claimants was in accordance with its own laws.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal draws a distinction between permits to be granted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country concerned and those actions that require a change of said laws and regulations. To the extent that the application for a permit meets the requirements of the law, then, in accordance with the BIT and Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT, the investor should be granted such permit. On the other hand, said provision does not entitle an investor to a change of the normative framework of the country where it invests. All that an investor may expect is that the law be applied.\n\n206.\n\nAs explained by the Respondent, the carrying out of the investment would have required a change in the norms that regulate the urban sector in Chile. The PMRS forms part of this normative framework, as repeatedly stated by the Respondent. Laws and regulations may be changed by a country but it is not an entitlement that can be based in Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT. This clause is an assurance to the investor that the laws will be applied, and to the State a confirmation that its obligation under that article is confined to grant the permits in accordance with its own laws. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not breach the BIT by not changing the PMRS as required for the Project to proceed.\n\n**5. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimants affirm that MTD made its investment \"after receiving authorization to do so from the State; was forced to halt the execution of its project because it was informed that it lacked a necessary permit; attempted to obtain such permit but the attempts were rebuffed; as a result it was unable to continue with the Project and essentially lost the value of its investment. In these circumstances, the treatment suffered by the investor constitutes an indirect expropriation.\"172\n\nMemorial, para. 127.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their investment has been expropriated by the Respondent in breach of Article 4 of the BIT. The Claimants allege indirect expropriation resulting from actions and failure to act by the Respondent, irrespective of whether \"the State intended or not to cause an indirect expropriation.\"173 In making this argument, the Claimants rely on definitions of indirect expropriation by arbitral tribunals in the cases of *Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican States174* and *CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic175* and consider that the facts of their case are analogous to *Metalclad* and *Biloune176* : in these two cases \"arbitral tribunals have found that the failure or refusal of the host State to provide a necessary permit to the investor constituted an indirect expropriation.\"177\n\nIbid., para. 124.\n\n\"covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host state.\" (*Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000, 103, 16 ICSID Rev.-FILJ 165 (2001)).\n\n\"De facto expropriation or indirect expropriation, i.e. measures that do not involve an overt taking but that effectively neutralize the benefit of property of the foreign owner, are subject to expropriation claims. This is undisputed under international law.\" (*CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award, 13 September 2001, 604 available at http://www.cnts.cz/doc 10/en/pdf/cme-cr-eng.pdf (citing Sacerdoti, J., *Bilateral Treaties and Multilateral Instruments on Investment Protection*, 1997 Recueil des Cours 382 (1998)).\n\n*Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd v. Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana*, 95 I.L.R. 183 (1994).\n\nMemorial, para. 126.\n\n209.\n\nChile is \"bewildered\" by this claim because \"MTD continues to enjoy full ownership of its interest in EPSA, and still has the right to seek zoning and other permits and approvals required under Chilean law [\u2026] MTD remains able to explore investment opportunities in Pirque and has the right to seek a modification of the PMRS, and other urban planning regulations.\"178 The Respondent draws attention to the award in *Feldman v. Mexico* which found that \"*not all governmental regulatory activity that makes it* *difficult or impossible for an investor to carry out a particular business, change in the* *law or change in the application of existing laws that makes it uneconomical to continue a particular business, is an expropriation.*\"179 The instant case does not concern \"the ***change*** of an existing law or the application thereof. To the contrary, this case merely involves the Republic of Chile's consistent application of its policies, regulations and laws.\"180\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 114 and Rejoinder, para. 10.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 115.\n\nIbid.\n\n210.\n\nIn the same vein, the Respondent contests the reliance of the Claimants on *Biloune*. There the arbitral tribunal held that \"the combination of measures used against the investor constituted constructive expropriation\". In the case before this Tribunal, the Respondent argues that \"*Biloune* simply does not support the theory that the denial of a permit alone or, as in the case of MTD, the absence of a change in zoning, constitutes a constructive expropriation [\u2026] contrary to the facts in *Biloune*, Chilean Government officials never assured MTD that a change in zoning would be *un*necessary or that MTD could proceed with its Project without modifying the PMRS.\"181\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimants respond to Chile's bewilderment about their expropriation claim by pointing out that, by definition, an indirect expropriation claim \"takes place when the State deprives the investor of the use and benefit of the investment without formally depriving the investor of title.\"182\n\nReply, para. 123.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants also contest the interpretation given by the Respondent to *Metalclad* and *Biloune* : \"MTD received authorization from the [S]tate of Chile to make an investment to develop a project in Pirque, but was denied the ability to proceed with the development because the State denied a key permit [\u2026] *Biloune is not a case about the number of acts that a State must undertake against an investment* [...] It is the overall impact of the state action on the investment that determines the existence of indirect expropriation. In this case, the refusal of the State of Chile to provide the key permit to allow the development of the Project in Pirque resulted in a complete frustration of the Project and a complete loss of in [sic] the value of MTD's investment.\"183\n\nReply, footnote 35 at pages 54-55.\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent contests again in the Rejoinder the arguments presented by the Claimants on expropriation and insists on the irrelevance of the cases relied on by the Claimants (*Middle East Cement*, *TECMED*) because no license was revoked or permit renewal denied: \"MTD has not identified any property right that has been seized by Chile. Moreover, MTD has admitted that it has been judicially compelled to accept an offer \u2018approximately equivalent to US $10,069,206' for its shares in EPSA, which hardly supports their claim that these are essentially without value.\"184\n\nRejoinder, para. 142.\n\n214.\n\nAs already stated, the Tribunal agrees with the argument of the Respondent that an investor does not have a right to a modification of the laws of the host country. As argued by the Respondent, \"every State has the power to amend any of its laws. The mere fact that Chile ***can*** change the PMRS does not mean, however, that Chile is ***obligated*** to do so.\"185 The issue in this case is not of expropriation but unfair treatment by the State when it approved an investment against the policy of the State itself. The investor did not have the right to the amendment of the PMRS. It is not a permit that has been denied, but a change in a regulation. It was the policy of the Respondent and its right not to change it. For the same reason, it was unfair to admit the investment in the country in the first place.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 144.\n\n**V. DAMAGES**\n--------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimants seek \"full compensation for the damage they have sustained as a consequence of the State of Chile's treaty violations, so that the Claimants are restored to the position they would be in had those treaty violations not occurred.\"186. This entails the recovery of : \"(i) the full cost of their investment (minus any remaining value), (ii) pre-award compound interest at a commercially reasonable rate, and (iii) the costs and expenses associated with this proceeding.\"187\n\nMemorial, para. 129.\n\nIbid., para. 130.\n\n216.\n\nChile contends that the Claimants have failed to prove the alleged losses and their causal link to the alleged breaches. Chile points out several fundamental flaws in their claim. First, they failed to mitigate their losses by entering into the Promissory Contract notwithstanding Minister Hermosilla's warning in the November 6, 1996 meeting that their project faced serious regulatory obstacles and without protecting themselves against the risks posed by these obstacles. The failure of the Claimants to mitigate losses is a cause of loss not attributable to the Republic of Chile.188\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 165.\n\n217.\n\nChile affirms that preparatory expenses till March 18, 1997 (date of signature of the first Foreign Investment Contract) should not be recoverable. As regards the other claimed losses, almost 80% occurred by transferring the funds to Chile between March 19, 1997 and the meeting held with Minister Hermosilla on May 20, 1997. During that period, architects, urban planners and governmental officials warned MTD that the Project faced serious difficulties and Mr. Hermosilla repeated his early warning.189 After May 20, 1997 and until September 25, 1998 when the SEREMI confirmed that the sectional plan could not be used to amend the PMRS, the Claimants spent more than US$ 1.4 million: \"any reasonable investor would have long since developed serious reservations about allocating additional funds to a questionable investment\".190 Even after September 25, 1998, the Claimants continued to spend more than US$ 3.2 million on the Project and then declined to take advantage of an opportunity to recover about half their losses when they rejected the offer made by Mr. Fontaine to buy their shares of EPSA on November 24, 2001.191\n\nIbid., para. 167.\n\nIbid., para. 168.\n\nIbid., para. 169.\n\n218.\n\nChile also questions whether the Claimants themselves actually incurred the losses: \"Most of the alleged losses - including equity injections, debt servicing, salary payments and various other expenses - are supported by documents relating to MTD Construction or MTD Capital.\"192 Chile also finds that the Claimants have failed to substantiate the fate of the amount injected in EPSA or \"explain whether the use of those funds constitutes recoverable losses.\"193\n\nIbid., para. 172.\n\nIbid., para. 173 and Rejoinder, para. 153.\n\n219.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there is no legal basis for the claim of interest or bank guarantee charges related to the loan used to finance the investment. Chile relies on the finding of the tribunal in *Middle East Cement* that \"denied costs related to a bank loan taken out by the claimant itself because such costs \u2018are normal commercial risks for the Claimant. They could only be claimed if, it were shown that they were caused by conduct of the Respondent which was in breach of the BIT'\"194. Chile argues that, \"[i]n the present case, Claimants not only did not take out the bank loan, but they also failed to demonstrate how a \u2018loss' relating to debt service was a direct result of actions or in actions by the Republic of Chile. Claimants fail to show that they incurred any losses related to debt servicing.\"195\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID CASE No. ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, paras. 153-154. Quoted in para. 178 of the Counter-Memorial.\n\nIbid., para. 178.\n\n220.\n\nChile contests the entitlement of Claimants to pre-award interest and maintains that \"international law, as a rule, does not allow compound interest\", and that, if the Tribunal should find that compound interest is allowed, then it would be \"required to take into account the circumstances of the case and not award compound interest.\"196\n\nIbid., para. 183.\n\n221.\n\nAs regards the level of the rate of interest, Chile offers the alternative of the average dollar-based \"*inter\u00e9s corriente*\"197 used for bank lending in Chile or the annual average of the London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\") as more reasonable alternatives to the 8% claimed by the Claimants.198\n\nThe statutory interest rate applied by courts in Chile.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 184.\n\n222.\n\nChile also argues that it is unclear how expenses under \"salaries\", \"travel expenses\" or \"other\" relate to the Project, and why they should be its responsibility.199\n\nIbid., paras. 179, 180 and 182.\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Claimants grossly understate the current value of their investment, particularly the value of the land that according to the valuation of the Claimants' expert is twenty times less than it was at the time they bought it.200\n\nIbid., paras. 185-189.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent requests that \"the Tribunal order Claimants to bear the expenses incurred by the Republic of Chile in connection with these proceedings, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in their entirety.\"201\n\nIbid., para. 191.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent does not dispute the standard of compensation advanced in the Memorial.202 They object to the interpretation given by the Respondent to the *Mihaly* award on the issue of preparatory costs. In that case, the tribunal found that \"certain preparatory expenses incurred by the investor did not give rise to an \u2018investment' for purposes of ICSID jurisdiction, in circumstances in which the State had made it clear that it did not intend to admit any investment from the claimant until execution of a binding investment contract.\"203 In the instant case, there is no dispute that the investment was approved and three Foreign Investment Contracts executed.\n\nReply, para. 127.\n\nIbid. para. 130.\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants also comment on the issue of mitigation of damages that precisely \"because the great majority of MTD's expenses are evidenced by its initial investment in early 1997, it was reasonable and consistent with MTD's obligation to mitigate damages for MTD to continue seeking Government approvals even after it became apparent that Government officials were opposing the Project.\"204 As for the failure to accept the buy-out offer of Mr. Fontaine, the Claimants maintain that such offer was illusory because of the terms of payment. In neither of the payment alternatives offered by Mr. Fontaine, the Claimants would be able to \"cash out\" their holdings in EPSA.205\n\nIbid., para. 131.\n\nIbid., paras. 132-135.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimants reaffirm that MTD Equity and MTD Chile directly made the initial investment with funds supplied to MTD Equity by MTD Capital: \"Contrary to the Respondent's assertions, MTD Equity directly incurred all other Project-related expenses, either directly through its owned subsidiary MTD Construction or by incurring legally enforceable obligations to its parent, MTD Capital, to repay expenditures that it made on MTD Equity's behalf.\"206\n\nIbid., para. 139.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the debt service and bank guarantee fees claimed as part of the damages are \"directly related to the State of Chile's actions destroying the value of MTD's investment and denying MTD any opportunity to recoup its costs and earn a return on capital. Because the Respondent's conduct breached its obligations to MTD under the Treaty, these payments fall squarely into the exception the *Middle East Cement* tribunal carved out for commercial risk costs that are incurred as a direct result of the State's misconduct.\"207\n\nIbid., para. 148.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants argue that compound interest is not unfair or inappropriate in the circumstances of this case because \"the State of Chile cannot escape the fact that it approved MTD's application to invest in a project in Pirque and then frustrated that investment. MTD's possession of the land does not diminish its losses. In contrast to the land owner in the *Santa Elena* case, which was \u2018able to use and exploit [the property] to some extent,' MTD has not been able to use its investment in the land held by EPSA for *any* kind of profitable activity.\"208\n\nIbid., para. 157.\n\n230.\n\nAs regards the interest rate applicable to pre-award interest, the Claimants recall that the dispute is not governed by Chilean law and therefore the *inter\u00e9s corriente* applied by Chilean courts is not appropriate. Similarly, it is not appropriate to apply LIBOR since they invest their dollars in local Malaysian markets: \"At a minimum, MTD should be awarded US$ 8,782 million in simple interest at its requested rate of 8 percent.\"209 The Claimants also find no merit to \"Chile's argument that the \u2018constructive value' of MTD's 51 percent share in EPSA should be US$ 12.8 million, which is based on a highly inflated estimate of land values and disallowance of most of MTD's investment expenses.\"210\n\nIbid., para. 158.\n\nIbid., para. 159.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants contest the current valuation of the land in the S\u00e1nchez Report commissioned by the Respondent. They allege that the S\u00e1nchez Report relies on valuation data for land that is not comparable to the land that EPSA owns. In particular, \"S\u00e1nchez relies on land values that he acknowledges have been affected by speculation about the pending Modification No. 48, which would permit urban development in Pirque.\"211 The Claimants argue that \"by relying on prices that may reflect speculation about potential opportunities for urban development if Modification No. 48 comes into effect, the Respondent is permissibly trying to capitalize on the effects of its own actions upon market values. Having denied MTD the opportunity to develop its Project on the ground that no urban development may be allowed, it cannot now take actions encouraging a speculative increase in price and thereby reduce MTD's compensation.\"212 The Claimants allege that the \"PIX assessment,213 which values land at US$ 1.27 million, is a more reliable measure of the impact of the State of Chile's refusal to allow development on the land.\"214\n\nIbid., para. 162.\n\nIbid., para. 163.\n\nCommissioned by the Claimants.\n\nReply, para. 163.\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimants consider faulty the argument that MTD overpaid for its shares in EPSA based on 1996 land values: \"To begin with, MTD did not simply buy land; it bought stock in a joint venture engaged in development of a business. The 1996 Palma Kitzing215 value analysis was based on the valuation of the assets to be used in such a venture, not bare land values, and assumed that the Project would be built. Ironically, the Respondent itself submitted (for very different purposes) the 1995 URBE Report, which estimated the value of the land for investment purposes in 1995-1996 at more than US$ 25 million.\"216 In any case, \"relying on the S\u00e1nchez Report's *post hoc* analysis as a basis to assess the value of the land in 1996 would be inconsistent with the practice of other international tribunals, which have rejected appraisals that were not prepared at the time the investor was injured.\"217\n\nPalma Kitzing is the firm contracted by Banco Sud Americano.\n\nIbid., para. 164.\n\nIbid., para. 166.\n\n233.\n\nAs regards Claimants' costs, the Claimants consider that the Respondent should bear all the costs associated with them because MTD's large investment losses were caused by the Respondent's improper actions.218\n\nIbid., para. 169.\n\n234.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent contests the additional claim of US$ 3.2 million in interest for \"delay resulting from Chile's request for an extension to file its Counter-Memorial.\"219 The Respondent argues that \"the Tribunal decided [...] that by application of Rules 10 and 12 of the Rules of Arbitration, the \u2018suspension' included all the issues related to the procedure, including time limits and the actions of the Tribunal. For that reason, the sum of US$ 3.2 million in interest that the Claimants attribute to the State must be rejected, since the procedure was suspended for all the \u2018issues related to the procedure.'\"220\n\nIbid., para. 147.\n\nIbid.\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent also points out that: (i) the Claimants are entitled to collect damages from their partner, Mr. Fontaine, in the amount offered by him to buy the Claimants' shares of EPSA; and (ii) the Claimants' concerns about the economic difficulties and solvency issues of their partner are of no relevance. The sum offered by Mr. Fontaine must be deducted from the amount claimed, as well as interest from November 24, 2001, the date of Mr. Fontaine's offer.221\n\nIbid., paras. 150-151.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent clarifies that, in the URBE report, the land was not appraised and this report only calculated the value of the project minus the costs, including the cost of land, a fact omitted by MTD. In contrast, Mr. S\u00e1nchez appraised the 600 hectares in El Principal and not the current value of the project, therefore, a comparison between the two is \"deceptive and inaccurate.\"222 The Respondent also finds that MTD has not been able to substantiate the fate of the US$ 8.4 million injected into EPSA.223\n\nIbid., paras. 176-177.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 173.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the following issues regarding damages that emerge from the parties' allegations:\n\n(i) Eligible expenses for purposes of calculating damages;\n\n(ii) Damages attributable to business risk;\n\n(iii) Date from which interest should accrue; and\n\n(iv) Applicable rate of interest.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that the BIT provides for the standard of compensation applicable to expropriation, \"prompt, adequate and effective\" (Article 4(c)). It does not provide what this standard should be in the case of compensation for breaches of the BIT on other grounds. The Claimants have proposed the classic standard enounced by the Permanent Court of Justice in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* : compensation should \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that had not been committed.\"224 The Respondent has not objected to the application of this standard and no differentiation has been made about the standard of compensation in relation to the grounds on which it is justified. Therefore, the Tribunal will apply the standard of compensation proposed by the Claimants to the extent of the damages awarded.\n\nQuoted in Reply, para. 127.\n\n**1. Eligible Expenditures**\n----------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have proven that the expenditures related to the Project were made by them or on their behalf and that they were made for purposes of the investment in Chile.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal considers as eligible for purposes of the calculation of damages the following expenditures:\n\n(i) Expenditures related to the initial investment in the amount of US$ 17,345,400.00.\n\n(ii) The Tribunal has found that Chile's responsibility is related to the approval of the transfer of funds by the FIC in spite of the policy of the Government not to change the PMRS. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that expenditures for the Project prior to the execution of the first Foreign Exchange Contract on March 18, 1997 are not eligible for purpose of the calculation of damages even if they could be considered part of the investment. For the same reason, expenditures made after November 4, 1998- the date on which Minister Henr\u00edquez informed the Claimants in writing that the PMRS would not be changed - are also to be excluded from said calculation. The total of expenditures during this period on account of salaries, travel, legal services and miscellaneous items, as detailed in Exhibit 93A submitted with the Reply, amount to US$ 235,605.37.\n\n(iii) The Tribunal considers the financial costs related to the investment made to be part of a business decision on how to finance the investment. As stated by the tribunal in *Middle East Cement* and referred to by the parties in their allegations: \"They could be claimed, if it were shown that they were caused by conduct of the Respondent which was in breach of the BIT.\"225 Since the Tribunal has found that Chile breached its obligation to treat the Claimants' investment fairly and equitably and this treatment is related to the decision of the Claimants to invest in Chile, the Tribunal considers that the financial costs related to the investment in the amount of US$ 3,888,582.95 are part of the eligible expenditures for purposes of the calculation of damages.\n\n*Middle East Cement*, para. 154.\n\n241.\n\nThe aggregate of the above eligible expenditures amounts to US$ 21,469,588.32. However, the residual value of the investment and the damages that can be attributed to business risk need to be deducted from such amount. The Tribunal will now turn its attention to these matters.\n\n**2. Damages Attributable to Business Risk. Residual value of the Investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal decided earlier that the Claimants incurred costs that were related to their business judgment irrespective of the breach of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT. As already noted, the Claimants, at the time of their contract with Mr. Fontaine, had made decisions that increased their risks in the transaction and for which they bear responsibility, regardless of the treatment given by Chile to the Claimants. They accepted to pay a price for the land with the Project without appropriate legal protection. A wise investor would not have paid full price up-front for land valued on the assumption of the realization of the Project; he would at least have staged future payments to project progress, including the issuance of the required development permits.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal considers therefore that the Claimants should bear part of the damages suffered and the Tribunal estimates that share to be 50% after deduction of the residual value of their investment calculated on the basis of the following considerations.\n\n244.\n\nMr. Fontaine has made an offer for MTD's EPSA shares of US$ 10,069,206. The Claimants are, by the terms of their shareholders' arrangements with Mr. Fontaine and as decided by an arbitral tribunal and confirmed by the Chilean courts, obliged to accept this offer or buy him out. For this reason, the Tribunal considers that the price offered by Mr. Fontaine for the shares of EPSA currently held by the Claimants constitutes the residual value of the investment. Because only part of the offer is in cash, the cash value of the remainder on a present value basis is US$ 9,726,943.48.226\n\nFor purposes of this calculation, the Tribunal has used the US dollar two-year swap rate of May 6, 2004 for a two-year swap effective May 21, 2004 published by *Bloomberg*. The two-year swap rate represents an interest rate at which semiannual cash flows may be discounted until the maturity of the swap. There are no LIBOR rates for period of more than one year.\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants had not accepted Mr. Fontaine's offer because it is not a full cash offer and are concerned about the uncertain financial situation of Mr. Fontaine. This is of no relevance to this Tribunal, since the risk of having chosen Mr. Fontaine as a partner should be borne by the Claimants. Chile had no participation in his selection nor has it been claimed that the financial difficulties of Mr. Fontaine can be attributed to Chile. The Claimants themselves have manifested that they knew all along about his financial difficulties. This is a business risk that the investors shall bear.\n\n246.\n\nTo conclude, the Claimants should bear the risk inherent in Mr. Fontaine's offer and 50% of the damages after deducting the present value of such offer from the total amount calculated in Section 1 above.\n\n**3. Date from which pre-award interest should accrue**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that interest on the amount of damages for which Chile is responsible should accrue from November 5, 1998, the day after Minister Henr\u00edquez notified the Claimants that it was against his Government's policy to modify the PMRS.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimants in their Reply increased the amount of their claim with the interest accrued during the extension granted by the Tribunal to the Respondent to file the Counter-Memorial. Chile has argued that the additional interest should not be awarded since the suspension was for all the \"issues related to the procedure.\"227 The Tribunal has awarded interest from November 5, 1998 for the reasons stated above and considers that the extension of the term for the submission of the Counter-Memorial does not have a bearing on this matter.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 147.\n\n**4. Applicable Rate of Interest**\n----------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants have requested that the Tribunal apply a compound annual interest rate of 8%. The Respondent has proposed the dollar-based annual rate of interest applicable in Chile or the average annual LIBOR. The Respondent has objected to a compound interest rate as not being in accordance with international law.\n\n250.\n\nThis being an international tribunal assessing damages under a bilateral investment treaty in an internationally traded currency related to an international transaction, it would seem in keeping with the nature of the dispute that the applicable rate of interest be the annual LIBOR on November 5 of each year since November 5, 1998 until payment of the awarded amount of damages. Based on the rates published daily by Bloomberg, the annual LIBOR on November 5 of each year since November 5, 1998 are as follows: (i) 5.03813 % in 1998, (ii) 6.16 % in 1999, (iii) 6.71625 % in 2000, (iv) 2.24625 % in 2001, (v) 1.62 % in 2002, and (vi) 1.4925 % in 2003.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that compound interest is more in accordance with the reality of financial transactions and a closer approximation to the actual value lost by an investor. As expressed by the tribunal in *Santa Elena* : \"Where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.\"228\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Final Award, 17 February 2000, para. 104.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n252.\n\nTaking into account that neither party has succeeded fully in its allegations, the Tribunal decides that each party shall bear its own expenses and fees related to this proceeding and 50 % of the costs of ICSID and the Tribunal.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n253.\n\nFor the reasons above stated the Tribunal unanimously decides that:\n\n1. The Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n2. The Claimants failed to protect themselves from business risks inherent to their investment in Chile.\n\n3. The Respondent shall pay the Claimants the amount of US$ 5,871,322.42.\n\n4. The Respondent shall pay compound interest on such amount from November 5, 1998 and determined as set forth in paragraphs 249- 251 above until such amount has been paid in full.\n\n5. The parties shall bear all their respective expenses and fees related to this proceeding.\n\n6. The parties shall share equally the fees and expenses incurred by ICSID and the Tribunal.\n\n7.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 30 September 2004, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre), pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), registered an application by the Republic of Chile (Chile) for the annulment of the Award of the Tribunal rendered on 25 May 2004 (the Award), in the case of *MTD Equity Sdn. & MTD Chile S.A. v. The Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/07) (the Application). Under the Award, the Republic of Chile is to pay approximately USD5.87 million, plus interest, to MTD Equity Sdn. & MTD Chile S.A. (MTD or the Claimants).\n\n2.\n\nThe Application contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules, for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n3.\n\nUpon registering the Application for Annulment on 30 September 2004, the Secretary General of ICSID notified the parties that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nOn 23 March 2005, at the first session of the Annulment Committee, consisting of the Hon. Judge Gilbert Guillaume of France as President, and Professor James Crawford of Australia and Dr. Sara Ordo\u00f1ez Noriega of Colombia as Members, MTD made a request under Arbitration Rule 54(2) for the stay of enforcement of the Award to be terminated unless appropriate security was put in place by Chile.\n\n5.\n\nThe Committee, having heard the oral arguments of the parties in that regard, requested Chile to file any proposal that it might have by 11 April 2005, and MTD to file any comments thereon by 18 April 2005. By agreement of the parties, the thirty-day deadline for a decision under Arbitration Rule 54(2) was extended on the understanding that the Committee would make its decision promptly after the Claimants\u2019 submission. Chile\u2019s submission was filed on 11 April 2005 and the Claimants\u2019 submission was filed, with the Tribunal\u2019s permission, on 20 April 2005.\n\n6.\n\nOn the same day Chile requested that it be allowed to file a further submission in response. Although objected to by MTD, the Committee granted Chile\u2019s request to make the further submission, while allowing MTD an equal amount of time to file a response. Each party filed its second round submission as thus permitted on 25 April 2005 and 2 May 2005, respectively.\n\nB. The Parties\u2019 Contentions\n---------------------------\n\n7.\n\nIn its observations dated 11 April 2005, Chile requested a continuance of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with Article 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. It submitted that Chilean law provides powerful international guarantees which \u201crender unnecessary the granting of any additional security in order to continue such a stay\u201d. It added that under Chilean law, \u201carbitration awards issued by a duly constituted Tribunal or Committee in accordance with the Convention, Regulations and Rules of ICSID, are fully recognized as awards emanating from a competent authority\u201d.\n\n8.\n\nIn particular \u201cthese obligations are formally sanctioned on an annual basis in the Law of Budgets of the Public Sector\u201d and more specifically for 2005, in Law No.19,986, title no. 50, chapter no.01, program 03, sub chapter 26, item 02- 001 entitled \u201cCumplimiento de Sentencias Ejecutoriadas\u201d (\u201cFulfillment of Final Judgments\u201d).\n\n9.\n\nFurthermore, under article 28 of Decree Law no. 1263 of 1973 of the Ministry of Finance, \u201cEl Ejecutivo podr\u00e1 ordenar pagos, excedi\u00e9ndose a las sumas consultadas en los rubros correspondientes \u2026 para el cumplimiento de sentencias ejecutoriadas dictadas por autoridad competente\u201d, which according to Chile could be translated into English as follows: \u201cThe Executive will be able to order payments exceeding the sums consulted in the corresponding areas \u2026 for the fulfillment of final judgments dictated by competent authority.\u201d\n\n10.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Executive is thus authorised to order payments exceeding the sums anticipated in the budget and it exercises this function through budgetary reassignment or additional sources of funding. Therefore, \u201cthe amount of the reserve will always hold sufficient funds to fulfill the Republic of Chile\u2019s expenses in connection with a judgment against it.\u201d\n\n11.\n\nFor these reasons Chile \u201crequest[s] that the Committee continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, without requiring any additional security over and above that which Chilean law already expressly contemplates.\u201d\n\n12.\n\nIn their response dated 20 April 2005, the Claimants \u201curge the Committee not to continue the stay of enforcement against the Award unless \u2026 Chile posts financial security guaranteeing payment promptly upon a decision refusing to annul the Award.\u201d\n\n13.\n\nMTD states that \u201chaving spent a decade pursuing the procedure specified by the Chile-Malaysia BIT and ICSID Convention, MTD should not face any additional delay in receiving payment if the Award is not annulled.\u201d It stresses that under article 52(5) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 54(2), \u201cannulment is an exceptional and rarely granted remedy.\u201d\n\n14.\n\nMTD submits that \u201cChile has not provided any meaningful assurance that MTD would receive full payment (with interest) immediately upon a decision refusing to annul the Award.\u201d According to MTD, Chile only identifies the procedure to be followed in order to request payment after the decision of the Committee. MTD adds that the authorities cited by Chile do not guarantee such a payment. In particular, the Budget law for the Public Sector for 2005 did not earmark any funds to pay the Award. Decree law 1263 of 1973 \u201cauthorizes payment of final judgments (*sentencias*), not final awards (*laudos*)\u201d in excess of the amount set forth in the Budget Law. Moreover the decree law authorizes such payment but does not require it. In any case, Chile may not rely upon provisions of its domestic law in an attempt to guarantee future compliance with its international obligations.\n\n15.\n\nThe request for stay presented by Chile, according to MTD, also fails because there is no showing that a stay is \u201crequired\u201d (see *CDC Group PLC v. Republic of Seychelles*, Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Whether to Continue Stay and Order, July 2004). \u201cThe two-year delay MTD faces in enforcing the Award\u201d must be \u201ccounterbalanced by financial security guaranteeing prompt payment if the Award is not annulled.\u201d\n\n16.\n\nAccording to the Reply of Chile dated 25 April 2005, \u201cMTD\u2019s principal argument [is] that the mere incidence of delay in obtaining enforcement of the Award as a result of the annulment proceedings requires the posting of financial security by the Republic of Chile\u201d. MTD had no ground of concern that the Award might not be honored by Chile pursuant to its ICSID obligations. In fact, MTD only stresses that it made its investment in 1996, has been receiving no return on the capital since then and would have to wait another year or so for the Committee\u2019s decision.\n\n17.\n\nChile submits that accepting MTD\u2019s argument would mean that all *ad hoc* Committees \u201cwould automatically have to decide that each and every State applying for annulment would have to post security\u201d. Moreover it would imply that the Committee will accept MTD\u2019s substantive claims. Finally, Chile contends that the two-year delay MTD faces until the day of payment is counter- balanced by the interest it would receive if Chile\u2019s application is not upheld.\n\n18.\n\nChile adds that it has not delayed the proceedings in the arbitration, and that annulment is a serious remedy provided by the ICSID Convention which Chile has the right to invoke and which it invoked within the prescribed time- limit.\n\n19.\n\nChile contends also that the continuance of the stay is not at issue in the present case, but only the question of the assurance to be given with respect to financial security: \u201cHad a briefing on the continuance of the stay been called for, Chile would have addressed the extensive circumstances to be considered in favor of continuation of such a stay, including the difficulty and costs imposed by the necessity for\u2026Chile, once having prevailed in the annulment proceedings, to recoup an Award\u2026 from a private company in Malaysia which would have had the free use of such wind fall amount for more than a year\u201d; the seriousness of the application for annulment; the harmful consequences of a payment upon the economic and social development of Chile; the commitment taken by Chile in writing to carry out its international obligation and the fact that the Award carries interest and that the Claimants suffer no conceivable loss.\n\n20.\n\nAnswering questions posed by the Committee on 22 April 2005, Chile states that it \u201clacks precise precedent showing that the term \u2018*sentencias*\u2019 in Decree Law 1263 and 3346 include international Awards\u201d. However it recalls that Chile has promulgated the ICSID Convention as domestic law (decree No. 1304 published in the *Diario oficial* of 9 January 1992) and that Article 54 of the Convention, in its Spanish version, as published, creates an obligation to enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by an award (\u201c*laudo*\u201d) as if it were a final judgment (\u201c*sentencia*\u201d).\n\n21.\n\nFinally, Chile submits that \u201ca continuance of the stay of the enforcement of the Award is appropriate and justified, and that a requirement of an additional financial security \u2026 is unwarranted and unsupported by the totality of the circumstances presented by the annulment proceedings\u201d. Chile reiterates its commitment to \u201cthe fulfillment of its ICSID obligations upon the issuance of a decision by the Committee\u201d.\n\n22.\n\nIn its Rejoinder dated 2 May 2005, MTD recalls its concern about past delays and expresses the fear that MTD will face new delays in the enforcement of the Award, taking into account Chile\u2019s change of administration scheduled for March 2006 and Chile\u2019s internal payment procedures. MTD notes that Chile \u201ccannot cite any authority showing that the term \u2018*sentencias*\u2019 (judgments) in Decree-Laws 1263 and 3346 includes international arbitral Awards\u201d and that it \u201ccites no provision of its domestic law that actually implements the obligation of Article 54 [of the ICSID Convention], that is that converts an ICSID Award into a domestic judgment or otherwise provides for its enforcement.\u201d\n\n23.\n\nMTD also contends that Chile does not meet its obligation to specify the circumstances that require the stay. It submits that, even if such a stay was to be decided, it must be accompanied by the posting of security. In this respect it states that \u201cthe accrual of interest does not redress the full measure of harm to MTD that would result from additional delays. Every month of delay in repayment prevents MTD from undertaking projects and creating jobs with [its] capital\u201d.\n\nC. The *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s Views\n---------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides: \u201c(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\u201d\n\n25.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n**\u201cStay of Enforcement of the Award**\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3)\u00a0shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay\u00a0of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\u201d\n\n26.\n\nOn a request under Rule 54(1), the Committee has a discretion which it should exercise, after both parties have had an opportunity to be heard, taking into account any relevant circumstances. The effect of the stay is that the award is not subject to enforcement proceedings under Article 54 of the Convention pending the outcome of the annulment application. Since a stay is not automatic the Tribunal could grant the request subject to conditions, including a condition that an appropriate bond be provided.\n\n27.\n\nThe question whether a stay should be granted unconditionally or on condition of a bank guarantee has been discussed in a number of earlier proceedings.1\n\n(a) In *Amco Asia Corporation v Republic of Indonesia (First Annulment)*, the Committee granted a stay on condition of the furnishing of a bank guarantee.2 A similar order was made in the second annulment proceeding between the same parties.3\n\n(b) In *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v Republic of Guinea*, the Committee declined to impose the condition of a guarantee, on the basis that this would be costly and would place the Claimant \u201cin a much more favourable position than it enjoys at the present time\u201d.4\n\n(c) In *Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt*, the Committee continued the stay of execution conditional on the provision of a guarantee in the amount of the award.5\n\n(d) In *CDC Group PLC v Republic of the Seychelles*, the Committee held that there was no evidence of \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d to the Respondent which could follow the immediate enforcement of the award, and that as a matter of fairness to the Claimant the delay caused by the annulment proceedings should be addressed by the provision of security as a condition of a stay.6\n\n(e) In *Mitchell v Democratic Republic of Congo* the Committee by majority declined to make the stay conditional upon the posting of security on the basis that it was \u201cnot convinced that the DRC, albeit its present political difficulties, will not comply in the future with its international obligations driving from the ICSID Convention\u201d.7\n\nSee also C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention.

Democratic Republic of Congo* (Case No ARB/99/7), Decision of 30 November 2004, para. 42.\n\n28.\n\nThe Committee agrees with earlier decisions to the effect that, unless there is some indication that the annulment application is brought without any basis under the Convention, i.e., that it is dilatory, it is not for the Committee to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not it is likely to succeed. In requesting annulment, an applicant avails itself of a right given by the Convention. There is no indication here that Chile is acting in a merely dilatory manner. Thus the Committee does not need to form any view as to the likelihood of success of the application for annulment in the present case.\n\n29.\n\nAs a general matter a respondent State seeking annulment should be entitled to a stay provided it gives reasonable assurances that the award, if not annulled, will be complied with. It should not be exposed, while exercising procedural rights open to it under the Convention, to the risk that payment made under an award which is eventually annulled may turn out to be irrecoverable from an insolvent claimant. At the same time a Respondent seeking a remedy under the Convention should demonstrate that for its part it will comply with the Convention, and if there is doubt in that regard the Committee may order the provision of a bank guarantee as a condition of a stay.\n\n30.\n\nIt is true that the provision of a bank guarantee puts a claimant in a better position than it would be if annulment had not been sought, since it converts the undertaking of compliance under Article 53 of the Convention into a financial guarantee and avoids any issue of sovereign immunity from execution, which is expressly reserved by Article 55 of the Convention. On the other hand, a request for annulment causes significant delay to the claimant, with the consequent possibility of prejudice. Although this can be dealt with by an award of interest in the event that the annulment application fails, nonetheless there will have been a further delay in the award becoming enforceable and this is a factor entitled to some weight.\n\n31.\n\nDespite this, in the Committee\u2019s view the key feature of the situation is that, by the express terms of Article 54 of the Convention, an ICSID award is to be given the same effect as a final judgment of the courts of the Respondent State. As compared with other international arbitral arrangements, final awards under the ICSID Convention are directly enforceable, upon registration and without further jurisdictional control, as final judgments of the courts of the host State. It is true that immunity from execution is reserved (Article 55), but this simply leaves the issue of immunity to be dealt with under the applicable law: \u201cImmunity from execution of the host State in its own courts would depend entirely on its domestic law.\u201d8\n\nSchreuer, 117\n\n32.\n\nStates Parties to the Convention have an obligation to give effect to Article 54 of the Convention in their internal law. Exactly how this is done depends on the constitutional arrangements of the State Party concerned; the point for the Committee is to be satisfied that the State Party has taken appropriate steps in accordance with its constitutional arrangements to give effect to Article 54. Where it has done so, subsequent compliance by that State with a final award will be a matter of legal right under its own law, as well as under international law.\n\n33.\n\nChile states that the annual law of budgets of the public sector, and in particular the law for the year 2005, contains an item entitled \u201cfulfillment of final judgments\u201d. It recognizes that under this item only a token amount of money is provided. However it adds that article 28 of Decree Law 1263 of 1973 of the Ministry of Finance authorizes the Executive to order payments exceeding the sums anticipated, *inter alia* for the fulfillment of final judgments (\u201c*para el cumplimiento de sentencias ejecutoriadas*\u201d). Moreover, under article 2(m) of Decree Law 3346 of 1980, the Ministry of Justice is required to perform the following functions: \u201c(m) to take the necessary measures for the fulfillment of the final judgments rendered against the Treasury\u201d (\u201c*dictar las resoluciones necesarias para el cumplimiento de las sentencias ejecutoriadas que condenen al fisco*\u201d).\n\n34.\n\nIt is doubtful whether an award of an ICSID Tribunal falls within the term \u201c*sentencias*\u201d in Decree-Laws 1263 and 3346. However the Respondent points out that a Presidential decree has implemented the Convention as part of Chilean law. Decree No. 1304, published in the *Diario Oficial* of 9 January 1992, recites the Congressional approval given to Chilean ratification of the Convention and specifies that:\n\n\u201cby the authority vested in me by articles 32 No. 17 and 50 No. 1 of the Political Constitution of the Republic, I decree and order that [the Convention] be executed and take effect as law and that an authorized copy of its text be published in the *Diario Oficial*.\u201d9\n\nThe original text reads: \u201cen uso de la faculdad que me confieren los art\u00edculos 32 N\u00b0 17 y 50 n\u00famero 1) de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de la Rep\u00fablica, dispongo y mando que se cumpla y lleve a efecto como ley y que se publique copia autorizada de su texto en el Diario Oficial.\u201d\n\n35.\n\nChile represents\u2014and the Committee has no basis for disagreeing\u2014that the effect of this provision is that an ICSID award is to be given exactly the same effect as a final judgment of the Chilean courts, i.e., it must thereupon be considered as a judgment for the purposes of Decree Laws 1263 and 3346. Chile has further noted that it has always complied with its international payment obligations and with all judgments or awards of international courts and tribunals. It affirms that it will do so, if and to the extent that the award against it becomes final, in the present case.\n\n36.\n\nHaving regard to the matters referred to above, in the Committee\u2019s view Chile has demonstrated that MTD will not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other than in respect of the delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which can be remedied by the payment of interest in the event that the annulment application is unsuccessful.\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Committee, unanimously:\n\nCONTINUES IN FORCE the stay in the enforcement of the award pending its decision on the Application for Annulment."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2007-03-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**A. THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS**\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 20 September 2004, the Republic of Chile (\"Chile\" or \"the Respondent\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") an application requesting the annulment of an Award dated 25 May 2004 rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration commenced by MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. (collectively \"the Claimants\" or \"MTD\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"). In it, the Respondent sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically that: the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers; that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and that the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based. The Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award pending decision on the Application for Annulment.\n\n3.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 30 September 2004 and on that date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the, ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties, at the same time forwarding to the Claimants copies of the Application and accompanying documentation. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was being provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of 18 January 2005, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified that the *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted, and was composed of Judge Gilbert Guillaume, Professor James Crawford and Dr. Sara Ordonez Noriega. The parties were further notified by letter of 24 January 2005, that Judge Gilbert Guillaume had been designated President of the Committee, and on 16 March 2005, the Centre sent to the parties copies of Declarations signed by Members of the Committee pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2).\n\n5.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held on 23 March 2005, at the premises of the World Bank in Paris, France, and several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. Also, at that meeting, the Claimants made a request under Arbitration Rule 54(2) for the stay of enforcement of the Award to be terminated unless appropriate security was put in place by Chile. The Committee, having heard oral arguments of the parties in that regard, established the schedule for the parties to file any further submissions that they would have in writing. By agreement of the parties, the thirty-day deadline for a decision under Arbitration Rule 54(2) was extended on the understanding that the Committee would make its decision promptly after the written submissions.\n\n6.\n\nIn its Decision of 1 June 2005, the Committee ordered that the stay of execution be continued without the need for Chile to put any security in place.1 It did so on the ground that the only prejudice the Claimants would suffer was in respect of delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and could be remedied by the payment of interest in the event the annulment application is unsuccessful. In particular the Committee noted Chile's representations (a) that the ICSID Convention has been fully implemented under Chilean law, with the consequence that an ICSID award is to be given exactly the same effect as a final judgment of the Chilean courts, and (b) that in conformity with its established practice, Chile will promptly comply with the present Award, if it is not annulled.2\n\nMTD Equity Sdn Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v.

THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nFollowing discussions with various Chilean officials, MTD Equity Sdn Bhd (a Malaysian company) and its wholly owned subsidiary, MTD Chile S.A. (a Chilean company), decided to pursue negotiations concerning a mixed-use planned community in the small town of Pirque, south of Santiago. The proposed site was zoned for agricultural use and, as the Claimants knew, would require rezoning in order to be developed. Following negotiations with the Chilean owner of the land, Mr. Jorge Fontaine Aldunate, and with three Chilean agencies, the Foreign Investment Commission (\"FIC\"), the Servicio de Vivienda y Urbanizaci\u00f3n (\"SERVIU\") and the Secretario Regional Ministerial (\"SEREMI\"), the Claimants entered into a Promissory Contract on 13 December 1996. The Promissory Contract was conditional upon FIC's approval of the Claimants' investment. It provided for the development of the land in two tranches and the creation of a Chilean corporation, El Principal Inversiones S.A. (\"EPSA\") to be owned 51% by the Claimants and 49% by Mr. Fontaine.\n\n12.\n\nOn 14 January 1997, the Claimants filed an application with the FIC for approval of an initial investment of US$17,136 million, for a project described as development of \"a township of 600 hectares of Fundo El Principal de Pirque, which will be a self-sufficient satellite city, with houses, apartments for diverse socio-economical strata, schools, hospitals, universities, supermarkets, commerce of all sorts, services and all other components necessary for self-sufficiency.\"3 The application was approved by the FIC on 3 March 1997. A standard Foreign Investment Contract was signed by the FIC and the Claimants on 18 March 1997; it provided that MTD would \"develop a real estate project on 600 hectares of Fundo El Principal de Pirque. The aforementioned project consists of the construction of a self-sufficient satellite city, with houses, apartments, schools, hospitals, commerce, services, etc..\"4 After signature of this first Contract, the Claimants made a US$8.4 million capital contribution to EPSA and with US$8,736 million purchased 51% of the shares in EPSA from Mr. Fontaine.\n\nAward, para. 51.\n\nAward, para. 54.\n\n13.\n\nOn 8 April 1997 the Claimants submitted a second application with the FIC for the investment of additional working capital of US$364,000, which was approved. A second standard Foreign Investment Contract, likewise specifying the location of the project, was signed on 13 May 1997.5\n\nMuch later, on 9 September 1999, a third Foreign Investment Contract was concluded. It did not specify the location of the Project. *See* Award, para. 84.\n\n14.\n\nBoth Foreign Investment Contracts contained the following clause:\n\n4. In any event, it is established that the Foreign Investor shall be subject to the current laws and regulations in effect regarding its activities. The present authorization is without prejudice to any others which, pursuant to such laws and regulations must be granted by the competent authorities.\n\nIt was not disputed that the word \"others\" in clause 4 refers to other authorizations required by Chilean laws and regulations.\n\n15.\n\nThe zoning of the site at Pirque was covered by the Plano Regulador Metropoliano de Santiago (\"PRMS\") and zoning changes for the Project were handled by the SEREMI. On 16 April 1998, the Claimants were informed that the Project was inconsistent with the Government's urban development policy. On 3 June 1998, the SEREMI wrote to MTD stating that the PRMS would not be changed: therefore the zoning changes required for the Project to go ahead were not approved. The Claimants' request for assistance from the FIC was rejected. On 4 November 1998, the Minister formally rejected the Project.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 June 1999, the Claimants notified the Respondent that an investment dispute existed under the terms of a 1992 Agreement between the Government of Malaysia and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the BIT).6 At the end of the three-month negotiation period required by Article 6(3) of the BIT before the dispute could be brought to arbitration, the dispute remained unresolved. At the Respondent's request, the negotiation period was extended by 30 days but no agreement was reached.\n\nAgreement between the Government of Malaysia and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 11 November 1992 (in force as of 4 August 1995). *See* Spanish version of the BIT, *available at* http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/chile\\_malasia\\_sp.pdf.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 June 2001, the Claimants filed the request for arbitration. The Claimants alleged, first, that the Respondent had breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT when, having created and encouraged the strong expectation that the Project was feasible from a regulatory viewpoint in the specific proposed location, it subsequently disapproved that location after the Claimants had irrevocably committed their investment.\n\n18.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants relied on the most-favoured-nation clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT, which provides that investments \"shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable, and not less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State.\" The Claimants argued that the MFN clause attracted several provisions of other Chilean BITs. In particular it relied on Article 3(1) of the BIT with Denmark,7 requiring the host State to observe \"any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments,\" an obligation which in this case extended to the Foreign Investment Contracts. The Claimants also contended that the Respondent had breached Article 3(3) of the Treaty with Croatia, which relates to impairment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures, as well as Article 3(2), which provides that when a contracting party had \"admitted an investment in its territory, it shall grant the necessary permits in accordance with its laws and regulations.\"8\n\nAgreement between the Government of the Republic of Chile and the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 28 May 1993 (in force: 3 November 1995): 1935 UNTS 263, *available at* http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/chile\\_denmark.pdf.\n\nThe text of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Chile and the Government of the Republic of Croatia concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, 28 November 1993 (in force: 15 June 1996), *available at* http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/chile\\_croatia.pdf.\n\n19.\n\nThirdly, the Claimants argued that the refusal to grant the necessary permits amounted to an indirect expropriation in breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n20.\n\nIn respect of these breaches MTD claimed \"all damages to which it may be entitled under applicable law, including, without limitation, (a) all ***damnum emergens*** suffered by MTD as a consequence of the Respondent's breach of the Investment Contracts and the Treaty, including the amounts invested under the Investment Contracts and all costs and expenses incurred by MTD in its efforts to carry out the Project; (b) all ***lucrum cessans*** that MTD would have derived from its investment had the Republic of Chile allowed the Project to go forward,\"9 together with costs and compound interest.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 74(iii).\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that any damage suffered was caused by a lack of due diligence by the Claimants. The trust placed in Mr. Fontaine, the lack of independent professional advice in the urban sector and the acceptance of an exorbitant land valuation at the time of making the investment were the effective causes of the Claimants' losses. At no stage did the Respondent or any of its officers commit to grant the planning approval which, as the Claimants knew or ought to have known, was required by law. On the contrary, according to the Respondent, MTD was told in the most explicit terms, at a meeting on 6 November 1996 attended by the Minister and the SEREMI, that there was a major obstacle to the Project in terms of the PRMS. In these circumstances MTD could have had no legitimate expectation as to the feasibility of the Project from a regulatory point of view, a position unaffected by the terms of the Foreign Investment Contracts concluded between the FIC and MTD.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S AWARD**\n---------------------------\n\n22.\n\nBy an award of 25 May 2004, the Tribunal (Dr. Andres Rigo Sureda, President; Messrs Marc Lalonde and Rodrigo Oreamuno Blanco) held, on the one hand, that Chile had breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(1) of the BIT but, on the other hand, that the Claimants had failed to protect themselves from business risks inherent in their investment in Chile. Responsibility for the loss being equally divided, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent should pay 50% of the assessed damages, viz., US$5,871,322.42, plus compound interest, and that each party should pay its own costs and 50% of the costs of arbitration.\n\n**(1) Overview**\n----------------\n\n23.\n\nMost aspects of the Tribunal's Award are not contested before the Committee and need only be briefly noted. The Tribunal held that:\n\n(a) MTD Equity was an investor under Article 1(c)(ii) of the BIT; MTD Chile, being wholly-owned by MTD Equity, was deemed to be a Malaysian national for purposes of arbitration proceedings in accordance with Article 6(2); thus both Claimants had standing to claim under the BIT.10\n\n(b) There was no breach of the MFN clause (in relation to Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT) by reason of any alleged breach of the Foreign Investment Contracts. As those Contracts made clear, the authorization to invest was only the beginning of a process which would require further permits and approvals. Since Chile was not in breach of the Foreign Investment Contracts in refusing permission for the Project, there was nothing on which the umbrella clause in Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT could operate.11\n\n(c) Adequate reasons having been provided for Chile's refusal to modify or avoid the PRMS, there was no basis for considering such refusals to be discriminatory.12\n\n(d) The Respondent did not breach the MFN clause (in relation to Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT) by refusing to change the PRMS to allow the Project to proceed. The Claimants had no right to a change in the normative framework of the country where it invested, and the PRMS was part of that framework. All that the Claimants could expect was that the law be applied.13\n\n(e) Since the Claimants \"did not have a right to the amendment of the PRMS,\" the refusal of permission did not amount to an expropriation; rather the issue was one of unfair treatment by the State when it approved an investment which was against the policy of the State itself at that time.14\n\nAward, paras. 92-94.\n\nAward, paras. 179-89.\n\nAward, paras. 190-96.\n\nAward, paras. 197-205.\n\nAward, paras. 207-14.\n\n24.\n\nChile also does not contest certain findings of the Tribunal which were consequential upon its finding of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In particular it does not contest:\n\n(f) the Tribunal's finding that the Claimants failed to take adequate and reasonable measures to investigate planning issues and to protect themselves in their contractual dealings with Mr Fontaine;15\n\n(g) except on two points, its calculation of the total damages;16\n\n(h) its finding that compound interest is payable.17\n\nAward, para. 168-78.\n\nAward, paras. 215-48. *See infra* para. 25(k) for the points of disagreement.\n\nAward, paras. 249-51.\n\n25.\n\nWhat Chile does contest in these annulment proceedings are the following findings:\n\n(i) the Tribunal's finding that \"approval of an investment by the FIC for a project that is against the urban policy of the Government is a breach of the obligation to treat an investor fairly and equitably,\"18\n\n(j) its finding that the damages must be shared equally between the parties, on the basis that each was partly responsible for the loss,19 and\n\n(k) two specific aspects of the damages calculation: one concerning the assessed price of the land; one concerning the Tribunal's choice of 4 November 1998 as the cut-of point for damages calculation when 3 June 1998 (or even some earlier date) should have been chosen.20\n\nAward, para. 166; *see, generally,* Award, paras. 107-67; Request for Annulment, paras. 52-81.\n\nAward, paras. 242-46; Request for Annulment, paras. 82-83.\n\nAward, para. 240(ii); Request for Annulment, paras. 84-85.\n\n26.\n\nBefore turning to the grounds for annulment invoked by Chile and their application to these aspects of the Award, it is helpful to set out in more detail the reasons given by the Tribunal for reaching the challenged decisions.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's findings on fair and equitable treatment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a)** ***The fair and equitable treatment standard***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nArticle 2 of the BIT is entitled \"Promotion and Protection of Investments.\" Article 2(2) provides that:\n\nInvestments of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\nArticle 3(1) (entitled \"Most Favoured Nation Provisions\") provides:\n\nInvestments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall receive fair and equitable treatment, and no less favourable than that granted to the investments made by investors of any third State.\n\nThere are thus not one but two provisions in the BIT providing that investments \"shall receive fair and equitable treatment.\" Furthermore, Article 4(1) of the Croatia-Chile BIT provides that the right to fair and equitable treatment shall \"not be hindered in practice.\" After drawing attention to the various sources of the obligation in the BIT,21 the Tribunal referred in generic terms to the \"obligation to treat investments fairly and equitably.\"22\n\nAward, paras. 105(i), 107, 113, 116.\n\n*See infra* paras. 78-79 on the relation between the various sources of obligation and the Tribunal's *dispositif*.\n\n28.\n\nWhile noting that the parties appeared to agree on the meaning of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal discussed aspects of the standard, concluding that:\n\n[I]n terms of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. Its terms are framed as a pro-active statement... rather than prescriptions for a passive behavior of the State or avoidance of prejudicial conduct to the investors.23\n\nAfter citing a passage from the award in the *TECMED* case24 it concluded: \"This is the standard that the Tribunal will apply to the facts of this case.\"25\n\nAward, para. 113; *see also* Award, paras. 109-13 for the discussion\n\nAward, para. 114 (citing\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)00/2, (2003) 10 ICSID Reports 130, 192-93, para. 154).\n\nAward, para. 116.\n\n**(b)** ***Application of the standard to the facts***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nTurning to the application of this standard to this dispute, in its presentation of this part of its claim the Claimants identified the key question as follows:\n\nWhether the state of Chile may properly enter into a binding foreign investment contract that specifies the purposes and location of a particular investment project while, at the same time, knowing (and not telling the investor) that the Government will never allow the investor to carry out the project that is the premise of the contract.26\n\nTo this question the Tribunal gave a negative answer.27\n\nAward, para. 129 (quoting Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 36).\n\n*See* Award, paras. 163, 166, 189, 196, 214, 240(ii) for different expressions of this finding.\n\n30.\n\nIn principle, given the Tribunal's interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard (to which the Committee will return), Chile could have responded to this question in four ways. First, it could have argued that it was not the policy of Chile at the time the investment was made that the Project would never be allowed and that the definitive decision not to allow it was taken later: on that basis there would have been no inconsistency between the Foreign Investment Contracts and the eventual planning decision. Second, it could have argued that Chile's urban development policy for the region was settled and was adverse to the Project but that the Claimants were expressly put on notice of this fact. Third, it could have argued that the \"binding foreign investment contract\" to which the Claimants refer did not entail any commitment by Chile as to the location of the Project but was simply indicative. Fourth, it could have argued that irrespective of the answers to the first three questions, the Claimants took the risk that their project might not be approved.\n\n31.\n\nIt must be stressed that while the Respondent made the second, third and fourth of these arguments before the Tribunal, it did not make the first. To have done so would have been inconsistent with its primary defence on the facts, which was based on the alleged meeting of 6 November 1996. Under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an annulment proceeding is not an appeal, still less a retrial; it is a form of review on specified and limited grounds which take as their premise the record before the Tribunal. Thus the core question for the Committee is - assuming for the moment that the Tribunal made no annullable error in its formulation of the fair and equitable treatment standard - whether any annullable error was made in answering the three basic arguments put before it.\n\n**(c)** ***The Tribunal's treatment of Chile's notice argument***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBefore the Tribunal, the Respondent placed heavy reliance on a meeting which it said took place on 6 November 1996, between Mr. Edmundo Hermosilla (then Minister of MINVU), the SEREMI (Mr. Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez Tapia) and representatives of MTD, at which explicit warnings were given that the Project was contrary to current planning regulations and faced corresponding difficulties.28 This date is significant in that it was before MTD signed the Promissory Contract (13 December 1996), applied for initial FIC approval of the investment (14 January 1997) or did any other of the acts which qualified it as an investor in Chile. The meeting was referred to in the letter from the SEREMI of 3 June 1998 which was the first written notification to MTD that permission would not be granted to change or avoid the PRMS. No contemporary record was kept of the meeting of 6 November 1996, and the Claimants denied that it had occurred, or at least that it was attended by any representative of MTD.\n\nAward, para. 48 (quoting Counter-Memorial, para. 24).\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal having set out the arguments of the parties29 addressed this factual issue at some length,30 but in the event declined to resolve it.31 Instead the Tribunal said that it would \"analyze the situation with and without the meeting and to what extent the conduct of the parties is consequent with the statements allegedly made by Chilean officials and the Claimants' representatives,\" at this and other meetings.32 It noted that if categorically negative warnings had been given at these meetings, it would have been \"inconsequential for the Claimants to seek the FIC's approval for an investment considered unfeasible by high level officials of the Respondent.\"33 After discussing the scope and meaning of FIC approval it concluded:\n\n[W]hether the meeting of November 6, 1996 took place or not does not affect the outcome of these considerations. In fact, if it did take place, it is even more inexplicable that the FIC would approve the investment and the first two Foreign Investment Contracts would be signed. Minister Hermosilla and the FIC were different channels of communication of the Respondent with outside parties, but, for purposes of the obligations of Chile under the BIT, they represented Chile as a unit, as a monolith, to use the Respondent's term.34\n\nThus the Tribunal would have held that there was a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard whether or not the Claimants had been put on notice of the Respondent's policy as to urban development of areas to the south of Santiago such as Pirque. That being so, it did not (as the Respondent notes)35 make detailed findings as to what may have been said at other meetings.\n\nAward, paras, 117, 124, 126.\n\nAward, paras, 150-59.\n\nApart from the lack of any contemporary documentation of any kind (except the word \"Malaysia\" in the Minister's diary), it was unclear which MTD officers were present, if any. Evidence was adduced that two of the main MTD officers involved were not in Chile at the time.\n\nAward, para. 152. Other meetings or encounters, held or planned to be held between the parties in the period prior to the SEREMI's letter of 3 June 1998, are referred to at Award, paras. 44, 50, 58, 59, 60, 63, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 153. There were also controversies about inconsistent Chilean statements after that date, which the Tribunal mentioned but did not resolve: Award, paras. 156-57.\n\nAward, para. 158.\n\nAward, para. 166.\n\n*See* Application for Annulment, paras. 7, 11, 19, 20, 25, 27.\n\n**(d)** ***The Tribunal's finding on the role of FIC approval***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn the event a more significant controversy in terms of the Tribunal's conclusion concerned the role of the FIC in the process of foreign investment. Before the Tribunal the Claimants' position was that they had a right vis-\u00e0-vis Chile to develop the Project on the land in question by reason of their contract with the FIC, an organ of the Chilean State, albeit that various permissions had to be obtained before this right could be implemented. The Respondent's position was that all the FIC could do in law, and all it did in fact, was to give permission for the import of the necessary capital.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal adopted neither of these positions. After succinctly stating the positions of the Parties, the Tribunal concluded that the FIC's approval, signified in the Foreign Investment Contracts, had a distinct significance which was not limited to the right to import capital:\n\nApproval of a Project in a location would give *prima facie* to an investor the expectation that the project is feasible in that location from a regulatory point of view.36\n\nEven accepting the limited significance of the Foreign Investment Contracts for purposes of other permits and approvals that may required, they should be at least in themselves an indication that, from the Government's point of view, the Project is not against Government policy.37\n\nAward, para. 163.\n\nAward, para. 189.\n\n36.\n\nIt gave three reasons for reaching this conclusion:\n\n(1) The terms of the Law establishing the FIC and giving it power to approve on behalf of \"the Chilean State the inflow of foreign capital under this Decree-Law and to stipulate the terms and conditions of the corresponding contracts\" (Article 12).38\n\n(2) The requirement that the Application, and the resulting Foreign Investment Contract, must specify the location of the investment: \"A change in the location of the investment would require a change in the contract and hence, the approval of the FIC.\"39\n\n(3) The composition of the FIC, made up of Ministers and the President of the Central Bank (Article 13): \"the ministerial membership of the FIC is by itself proof of the importance that Chile attributes to its function, and it is consequent with the objective to coordinate foreign investment at the highest level of the Ministries concerned.\"40\n\nAward, para. 162.\n\nAward, para. 162.\n\nAward, para. 163.\n\n**(e)** ***The Tribunal's finding on regulatory risk***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argued, the risk is always on the investor to ascertain local legal requirements and to obtain necessary approvals and permits, a position confirmed by Article 4 of the Foreign Investment Contracts. Independently of any meetings held or warnings given, the regulatory risk was exclusively on the investor. The Tribunal agreed up to a point but drew a distinction:\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that it is the responsibility of the investor to assure itself that it is properly advised, particularly when investing abroad in an unfamiliar environment. However, in the case before us, Chile is not a passive party and the coherent action of the various officials through which Chile acts is the responsibility of Chile, not of the investor.41\n\nChile claims that it had no obligation to inform the Claimants and that the Claimants should have found out by themselves what the regulations and policies of the country were. The Tribunal agrees with this statement as a matter of principle, but Chile also has an obligation to act coherently and apply its policies consistently, *independently of how diligent an investor is*. Under international law (the law that this Tribunal has to apply to a dispute under the BIT), the State of Chile needs to be considered by the Tribunal as a unit..42\n\nAward, para. 164.\n\nAward, para. 165 (emphasis added).\n\n**(f)** ***The Tribunal's conclusion on fair and equitable treatment***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThus the Tribunal drew a distinction between individual permissions and licenses, which the investor had to obtain under the law of the host State, and the question whether the Project was possible from a regulatory point of view.\n\nThe Claimants contacted officials of the Respondent from the very beginning in May 1996. It is only in June 1998, almost two years after the supposed November 6, 1996 meeting, that the SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez informed the Claimants in writing about the policy against changing the zoning of El Principal and modifying the PMRS, and Minister Henr\u00edquez rejected the Project...  \n The Tribunal is satisfied, based on the evidence presented to it, that approval of an investment by the FIC based on a project which is against the urban policy of the Government is a breach of an obligation to treat an investor fairly and equitably.43\n\nAward, paras. 165-66.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's finding on contributory fault**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe second finding challenged by the Respondent concerns the contributory fault of the Claimants. There was ample material on which the Tribunal could conclude that MTD failed adequately to protect itself against regulatory risk, and that finding is not challenged by the Respondent. What the Respondent challenges in these proceedings is the conclusion that MTD's damages should be reduced only by 50% on account of this finding. In its view the real and evident cause of the Claimants' loss was their failure to conduct adequate due diligence prior to signing the contract with Mr. Fontaine. On that basis, imposing 50% of the responsibility on Chile was both arbitrary and unexplained.\n\n40.\n\nHaving discussed MTD's failings in some detail, the Tribunal said:\n\nThe Tribunal decided earlier that the Claimants incurred costs that were related to their business judgment irrespective of the breach of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT. As already noted, the Claimants, at the time of their contract with Mr. Fontaine, had made decisions that increased their risks in the transaction and for which they bear responsibility, regardless of the treatment given by Chile to the Claimants. They accepted to pay a price for the land with the Project without appropriate legal protection. A wise investor would not have paid full price up-front for land valued on the assumption of the realization of the Project; he would at least have staged future payments to project progress, including the issuance of the required development permits.  \n The Tribunal considers therefore that the Claimants should bear part of the damages suffered and the Tribunal estimates that share to be 50% after deduction of the residual value of their investment calculated on the basis of the following considerations.44\n\nAward, paras. 242-43.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's assessment of damages**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nAs to quantum, the Tribunal relied on \"the classic standard enounced by the Permanent Court of Justice in the Factory at Chorzow: compensation should \u2018wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that had not been committed.'\"45 In calculating the amount of damages the Tribunal accepted Chile's argument that preparatory expenses prior to 18 March 1997 (the date of signature of the first Foreign Investment Contract) were not recoverable,46 but allowed costs of financing.47 It then deducted the residual value of the land, which was taken to be the amount offered by Mr. Fontaine in November 2001, an offer the Claimants should have accepted.48 The resulting award was 50% of this total by reason of MTD's contribution to the damage.\n\nAward, para. 238.\n\nAward, paras. 217, 240(ii).\n\nAward, para. 240(iii).\n\nAward, para. 244.\n\n42.\n\nAs to the points in time before and after which MTD's costs could not be recovered, the Tribunal said only that:\n\nChile's responsibility is related to the approval of the transfer of funds by the FIC in spite of the policy of the Government not to change the PMRS. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that expenditures for the Project prior to the execution of the first Foreign Exchange Contract on March 18, 1997 are not eligible for purpose of the calculation of damages even if they could be considered part of the investment. For the same reason, expenditures made after November 4, 1998 - the date on which Minister Henriquez informed the Claimants in writing that the PMRS would not be changed - are also to be excluded from said calculation.49\n\nAward, para. 240(ii).\n\n**D. THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn its Application the Respondent identifies a large number of perceived defects in the Award's finding of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and also in its calculation of damages. In terms of the grounds for annulment enumerated in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, the focus is on gaps and apparent contradictions in the reasoning, i.e., on the failure to state the reasons on which the award is based (Article 52(1)(e)), although there is also reliance on the ground of manifest excess of powers, in particular the failure to apply the proper law and the arrogation without authority of the power to decide *ex aequo et bono* (Article 52(1)(b)) and on serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)). Something should be said about each of these.\n\n**(2) Manifest excess of powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn the present case Chile does not deny that there was a protected investment or that there is a dispute concerning that investment. No question of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide that dispute is therefore raised. But the ground of manifest excess of powers is not limited to jurisdictional error; it is established that a complete failure to apply the law to which a Tribunal is directed by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention can constitute a manifest excess of powers, as also a decision given *ex aequo et bono* - that is to say, in the exercise of a general discretion not conferred by the applicable law - which is not authorised by the parties under Article 42(3) of the Convention. The Respondent claims that there was a manifest excess of powers in the present case on the ground that the Tribunal failed to apply international law or Chilean law as required, and that it effectively decided aspects of the dispute on an *ex aequo et bono* basis.\n\n45.\n\nCommittees have sought to distinguish between failure to apply the law and error in its application. The Committee in the *MINE* case said:\n\n[A] tribunal's disregard of the agreed rules of law would constitute a derogation from the terms of reference within which the tribunal has been authorized to function. Examples of such a derogation include the application of rules of law other than the ones agreed by the parties, or a decision not based on any law unless the parties had agreed on a decision *ex aequo et bono*. If the derogation is manifest it entails a manifest excess of power.  \nDisregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, *even if manifestly unwarranted*, furnishes no ground for annulment....50\n\nIn *CDC*, the Committee put it in the following way: \"Regardless of our opinion of the correctness of the Tribunal's legal analysis... our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavoured to apply English law.\"51\n\n*MINE* (1989) 4 ICSID Reports 79, 87 (paras. 5.03-5.04) (emphasis added).\n\n*CDC Group* (2005) 11 ICSID Reports 237, 252 (para. 45).\n\n46.\n\nIn an expert opinion submitted with the Reply and adopted by the Respondent, Sir Arthur Watts argues that failure to apply the proper law as a ground of annulment should extend to cases where the tribunal makes \"a real and substantial mess of the law it was purporting to apply.\"52 In his opinion:\n\nThere comes a stage... at which a tribunal, in purportedly applying a rule of law, gets it so wrong that it must be regarded as having disregarded the rule and not really having applied it at all. The purported application of the rule must be so inadequate, and suffused with such fundamental error, that it transcends the mere commission of an error in applying the law and becomes instead a veritable case of its non-application.53\n\nOpinion of 20 January 2006 annexed to the Respondent's Annulment Reply, para. 25.\n\n*Id.* para. 27.\n\n47.\n\nApart from its inconsistency with the test articulated in cases such as *MINE* and *CDC*, the problem with this formulation is that it goes far down the slippery slope of appeal for error of law - error of law combined with adjectives perhaps, but error of law nonetheless. The Committee accepts that the notion of endeavouring to apply the law is not a merely subjective matter. An award will not escape annulment if the tribunal while purporting to apply the relevant law actually applies another, quite different law.54 But in such a case the error must be \"manifest,\" not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough.\n\nIn *MINE* the Tribunal had referred to Article 1134 of the French Civil Code rather than its Guinean replica, Article 1134 of the Code Civil de l'Union Fran\u00e7aise. The Committee held that the error did not warrant annulment: (1989) 4 *ICSID Reports* 79, 96 (para. 6.40). Since there was no evidence that Article 1134 was applied in any different manner in Guinea than in France, the mistake was without incidence.\n\n48.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to a claim that a tribunal has decided *ex aequo et bono*. It should be noted that Article 42(3) of the ICSID Convention concerns the determination *ex aequo et bono* of *disputes*, i.e., of the substantial matter referred to the tribunal. This is different from taking into account considerations of fairness in applying the law. For example, individual rules of law will often require fairness or a balancing of interests to be taken to account. This is the case with the fair and equitable treatment standard itself, the standard the Tribunal was required to apply.\n\n**(3) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nRelatively little needs to be said about this ground for annulment. Subsequent committees have approved the following passage from the *Wena Hotels* annulment decision:\n\nThe Applicant has to identify the fundamental rule of procedure from which the Tribunal departed and it has to show that such departure has been serious.  \n [Article 52(1)(d)] refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defence and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other....55\n\nThe issue is thus due process, not the substance of the Award itself, a matter addressed by paragraphs (b) and (e) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention\n\n*Wena Hotels*, (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 129, 142 (paras. 56-57), referred to *e.g.*, by the Committee in *CDC Group* (2005) 11 ICSID Reports 237, 248-50 (paras. 34-37).\n\n**(4) Failure to state reasons**\n--------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOf more significance to the present case is failure to state reasons. The first Annulment Committee in the *Vivendi* case discussed this in the following terms:\n\n[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.... Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\n\nIn the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.56\n\nCommittees in other annulment cases have expressed similar views.57\n\n*Vivendi* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 340, 358 (paras. 64-65).\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Amco Asia I* (1986) 1 ICSID Reports 509, 519-21 (paras. 38-44); *MINE* (1989) 4 *ICSID Reports* 79, 88-89 (paras. 5.07-5.13); *Amco Asia II* (1992) 9 ICSID Reports 3, 48-49 (paras. 7.55-7.57); *Wena Hotels* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 129, 145-46 (paras. 77-82); *CDC Group* (2005) 11 ICSID Reports 237, 259-61 (paras. 66-72); *Mitchell v DRC*, decision of 1 November 2006, para. 21.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent appears to accept this test, emphasising principally that a Committee can only fill gaps in the reasoning of a tribunal in limited circumstances, i.e., where the missing reason is clearly implied or is so obvious as not to need stating.58\n\n*See e.g.*, Reply Memorial, para. 4; Expert Opinion of Sir Arthur Watts, paras. 35-55.\n\n**(5) The scope of annulment authority**\n----------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn every annulment decision so far, the *ad hoc* committee has proclaimed that it is not a court of appeal from the tribunal.59 This is obvious from the language of Articles 52 and 53 of the ICSID Convention as well as from its *travaux*.60 But Chile's Application raises a question as to the function of annulment in cases where (as here) there is no jurisdictional error, no obvious procedural failing and no refusal to decide.\n\n*See Klockner* (1985) 2 ICSID Reports 4, 119-20 (para. 61); *Amco Asia I* (1986) 1 ICSID Reports 509, 515 (para. 23); *MINE* (1989) 4 *ICSID Reports* 79, 87 (para. 5.04), 88 (para. 5.08); *Amco Asia II* (1992) 9 ICSID Reports 3, 39 (para. 7.19), 51 (para. 8.08); *Wena Hotels* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 129, 135 (para. 18); *Vivendi* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 340, 357-58 (paras. 62, 64); *CDC Group PLC v. Republic of the Seychelles* (2005) 11 ICSID Reports 237, 248-250 (paras. 34-37); *Mitchell v. DRC*, decision of 1 November 2006, paras. 19-20.\n\n*See* C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, CUP, 2001) 88-94 & ff.\n\n53.\n\nIn his expert opinion appended to the Respondent's Reply, Sir Arthur Watts argues for a more expansive role for annulment Committees in relation to the substantive correctness of ICSID awards. He acknowledges the contrary argument (put in the competing expert opinion of Professor Schreuer):61\n\nIt can be said, of course, that for an *ad hoc* Committee to engage in an assessment of whether the tribunal's misunderstanding or disregard of the applicable law is or is not gross, or whether or not it relates to some major aspect of the applicable law, or whether that major aspect is directly relevant to the case which was before the tribunal, would be for it to enter to an unacceptable degree into the merits of the tribunal's decision. But there is no greater impropriety in an *ad hoc* Committee acting in this way in the interests of ensuring the fundamental justice of the arbitral process than in such a Committee taking it upon itself to consider complex (and arguable) cases of alleged excess of power (and whether, if the excess has occurred, it is manifest), or whether or not a tribunal has given reasons for its award when the answer to that very question is wrapped in the pages of a complex award, or with what reasons not advanced by the tribunal the *ad hoc* Committee should nevertheless reconstruct (in reality, invent) the tribunal's missing reasoning, or with the assessment whether any of the adverbial or adjectival requirements of Article 52(1) have been satisfied (\u2018properly,' \u2018manifestly,' \u2018serious,' \u2018fundamental'). These are not easy matters to be resolved by applying simple rules, but are matters for judgment, the exercise of which is exactly the task which *ad hoc* Committees are well-placed to perform.62\n\nC. Schreuer, Opinion of 5 December 2005 annexed to Claimants' Annulment Counter-Memorial.\n\nExpert Opinion of Sir Arthur Watts, para. 28\n\n54.\n\nNo doubt annulment committees have a role to perform within the ICSID system in ensuring \"the fundamental justice of the arbitral process.\" It is true also that the grounds for annulment do not distinguish formally (as, say, the UNCITRAL Model Law does) between jurisdictional errors and errors concerning the merits of the dispute and that a manifest excess of powers could well occur on a question of merits. At the same time the role of an *ad hoc* committee in the ICSID system is a limited one. It cannot substitute its determination on the merits for that of the tribunal. Nor can it direct a tribunal on a resubmission how it should resolve substantive issues in dispute. All it can do is annul the decision of the tribunal: it can extinguish a *res judicata* but on a question of merits it cannot create a new one.63 A more interventionist approach by committees on the merits of disputes would risk a renewed cycle of tribunal and annulment proceedings of the kind observed in *Klockner* and *AMCO.* Given that (after an uncertain start) successive decisions of *ad hoc* committees have established with reasonable clarity the extent and limits of the grounds for annulment under Article 52, the Committee believes that \"the fundamental justice of the arbitral process\" under the Convention is best served by adhering to the established approach. It is reinforced in this view by two considerations, one general and one specific. The general consideration is that Article 52(1) as interpreted by successive committees does give scope for quality control. The specific consideration is that in the present case, whether one likes the Tribunal's decision or not, it was reached on a rather narrow and specific ground, without systematic implications for controversial issues of the law of investment protection.\n\nA reconvened tribunal following an annulment will no doubt have regard to the reasoning of an annulment Committee, but it is not formally bound by its views as to any issue on which the first tribunal's award has been annulled. *See Amco Asia II* (1992) 9 ICSID Reports 3, 36-39 (paras. 7.10-7.17). Furthermore, the ICSID practice so far has been to appoint different committee members on a second annulment, whereas requests for interpretation or revision as far as possible go to the same tribunal as rendered the award: Art. 50(2), 51(3).\n\n**E. THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT APPLIED**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Relationship between grounds for annulment**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn its Annulment Memorial the Respondent tended to present its claim in an aggregated way: for example, it complained of the Tribunal's \"failure to apply or explain application of\" international law or Chilean law.64 Of course an aspect of an award may be vulnerable to challenge on more than one ground, but it is still necessary to distinguish the different grounds for challenge. Failure to apply the proper law (in the sense explained in paragraph 46 above) may involve a manifest excess of powers; failure to explain its application concerns the distinct issue of failure to give reasons. The two may go hand in hand in a given case but they are analytically distinct.\n\n*E.g.*, Respondent's Annulment Memorial at 56.\n\n**(2) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIt is convenient to deal first with the ground of annulment set out in Article 52(1)(d), \"that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\" The Respondent argues that:\n\n[I]n holding that there was a lack of fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal fails to consider or otherwise respond to abundant evidence presented by the Parties with respect to material issues in dispute that would have affected significantly its holding on liability as well as its assessment of compensation. For example, the Tribunal fails to consider expert evidence presented by both Parties on a range of issues, including the substantive interpretation of the Foreign Investment Contracts and the DL 600, a key element to its determination with regard to fair and equitable treatment. Furthermore, there are numerous instances throughout the Award where the Tribunal simply recounts the important arguments presented by each party but never analyzes or makes determinations regarding such questions. Accordingly, the Tribunal seriously departs from its fundamental obligation to accord the parties the right to be heard, and the Award should be annulled.65\n\nThe matter was not, however, further developed in the Reply or in oral argument.66\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 104.\n\nTranscript, 10 April 2006, at 12.\n\n57.\n\nUnder Article 52 there is a distinction between a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and a failure to give reasons for a decision. Failure to give reasons is a separate ground for annulment and there is no reason to think that it is duplicated under the rubric of Article 52(1)(d).67 Conceivably an award might recite the arguments of the parties in such a defective or inaccurate way as to evidence a failure to hear the arguments in the first place. But it cannot be suggested that this was the case here. The complaints referred to in the passage cited above will accordingly be dealt with under the rubric of failure to give reasons. There is no indication in the present case of any procedural failure by the Tribunal, let alone a serious one.\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 203 refers to a passage from the *Vivendi* annulment decision in support of annulment on this ground. *See* (2004) 6 ICSID Reports 340, 362 (para. 83). Although the Committee mentioned in passing that the Tribunal had rendered a \"densely reasoned award,\" it did so in the context of the distinction between \"the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not the content of its decision.\" Failure to state reasons goes to the latter, not the former.\n\n**(3) Fair and equitable treatment: manifest excess of powers**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe scope of manifest excess of powers as a ground for annulment has already been discussed.68 The Respondent complains that the Tribunal either failed to apply international law and Chilean law to the issues to which they are respectively applicable, or that it applied them in such a cursory and indefensible way as to be tantamount to their non-application.\n\n*See supra* paras. 43-47.\n\n59.\n\nThis raises three questions: (1) what law was in truth applicable to a given issue, in accordance with Article 42 of the ICSID Convention; (2) what law did the Tribunal purport to apply to that issue; (3) is there any basis for concluding that the Tribunal's decision involved a manifest failure to apply the applicable law, in the limited sense explained in paragraph 46 above?\n\n60.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimants say that in default of any discernible law the Tribunal decided key issues *ex aequo et bono* without being authorised to do so. The Parties agree that the Tribunal was not authorised under Article 42(3) to decide the dispute on an *ex aequo et bono* basis, so here the question is whether it did so and with what consequence.\n\n**(a)** ***Failure to apply international law***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\nThe BIT was in force at the time of the events giving rise to the claim. MTD's claim is one for \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment by such investor\" (BIT, Article 6(1)(ii)), and thus international law as the proper law of the BIT is applicable to that claim and to any defence thereto. The Respondent insists - and the Claimants do not disagree - that the Tribunal had to apply international law as a whole to the claim, and not the provisions of the BIT in isolation.\n\n62.\n\nFor its part the Tribunal also agreed. It said:\n\n[F]or purposes of Article 42(1) of the Convention, the parties have agreed to this arbitration under the BIT. This instrument being a treaty, the agreement to arbitrate under the BIT requires the Tribunal to apply international law.69\n\nIt went on to apply international law to such questions as the scope of the MFN clause in relation to other Chilean treaties, to the interpretation of the BIT, in particular its fair and equitable treatment clause, and to reparation including causation and contribution.\n\nAward, para. 87; *see also id.* para. 112: \"This being a Tribunal established under the BIT, it is obliged to apply the provisions of the BIT and interpret them in accordance with the norms of interpretation established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties, which is binding on the State parties to the BIT.\"  \n In fact, Malaysia only became a party to the Convention in 1994, after the conclusion of the BIT: thus the Vienna Convention *qua* treaty does not apply to the BIT (*see* Vienna Convention, Art. 4). But since the norms of interpretation would apply in any event this point is without incidence so far as the Award is concerned.\n\n63.\n\nAs to the scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard itself, the Respondent makes two main criticisms.70 First it says that the Tribunal confused fair and equitable treatment with most-favoured-nation treatment under Article 3(1) of the BIT, rendering this aspect of the Award incomprehensible.71 Secondly and more importantly, that it misapprehended the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT, applying a standard expressed in a dictum of the *TECMED* tribunal which in no way represents international law and which cannot be derived from Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the BIT by any process of interpretation. The Committee will deal with these points in turn.\n\nThe Respondent also criticises the Tribunal's emphasis on the State of Chile as a single unit or \"monolith:\" this is discussed in paras. 86-88, *infra*.\n\n*See* Chile's Annulment Reply, para. 57; Expert Opinion of Sir Arthur Watts, paras. 64-71.\n\n64.\n\nOn the first point, the Committee referred in paragraph 27 above to the two provisions of the BIT which incorporate the fair and equitable treatment standard. It noted the argument that the most-favoured-nation clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT72 imported an additional element from the Croatia-Chile BIT.73 The Tribunal discussed this issue in the following terms:\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether the provisions of the Croatia BIT and the Denmark BIT which deal with the obligation to award permits subsequent to approval of an investment and to fulfillment of contractual obligations, respectively, can be considered to be part of fair and equitable treatment.... The Tribunal has concluded that, under the BIT, the fair and equitable standard of treatment has to be interpreted in the manner most conducive to fulfill the objective of the BIT to protect investments and create conditions favorable to investments. The Tribunal considers that to include as part of the protections of the BIT those included in Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT and Article 3(3) and (4) [*sic* - this should read Article 4(1)] of the Croatia BIT is in consonance with this purpose. The Tribunal is further convinced of this conclusion by the fact that the exclusions in the MFN clause relate to tax treatment and regional cooperation, matters alien to the BIT but that, because of the general nature of the MFN clause, the Contracting Parties considered it prudent to exclude. *A contrario sensu*, other matters that can be construed to be part of the fair and equitable treatment of investors would be covered by the clause.74\n\nThis passage appears to confuse the notion of fair and equitable treatment required by the first part of Article 3(1) of the Malaysia-Chile BIT with the most-favoured-nation treatment which is required by the second half. The most-favoured-nation clause in Article 3(1) is not limited to attracting more favourable levels of treatment accorded to investments from third States only where they can be considered to fall within the scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Article 3(1) attracts any more favourable treatment extended to third State investments and does so unconditionally. However, the uncertainty in the Tribunal's handling of Article 3(1) was without incidence for its resolution of the case. As to Articles 3(1) of the Denmark BIT and 3(3) of the Croatia BIT, these are distinct from the notion of fair and equitable treatment but MTD's claims based on those provisions failed. As to the additional stipulation in Article 4(1) of the Croatia BIT to the effect that the fair and equitable treatment \"shall not be hindered in practice,\" no further reference was made to it in the Award and there is no indication that it affected the outcome in any way.\n\nArt. 3(1) of the BIT provides: \"Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall receive fair and equitable treatment, and no less favourable than that granted to the investments made by investors of any third State.\"\n\nArt. 4(1) of the Chile-Croatia BIT provides: \"Each Contracting Party shall extend fair and equitable treatment to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party on its territory and shall ensure that the exercise of the right thus recognized shall not be hindered in practice.\"\n\nAward, paras. 103-04.\n\n65.\n\nOn the second point, the Respondent focuses on the Tribunal's apparent reliance on the following passage from the award in the *TECMED* case for the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard:\n\n[T]o provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the state that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities. The investor also expects the state to use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation.75\n\nAward, para. 114 (quoting *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)00/2, (2003), 10 ICSID Reports 130, 192-93, para. 154).\n\n66.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"the *TecMed* programme for good governance\" is extreme and does not reflect international law.76 The *TECMED* dictum is also subject to strenuous criticism from the Respondent's experts, Mr. Jan Paulsson77 and Sir Arthur Watts.78 They note, *inter alia*, the difference between the *TECMED* standard and that adopted in other cases, including one the Tribunal also cited in a footnote but without comment.79\n\n*See* Chile's Annulment Reply, para. 57.\n\nMr. Jan Paulsson, Expert Opinion, 22 July 2005, paras. 9-14.\n\nExpert Opinion of Sir Arthur Watts, paras. 93-106.\n\nAward, para. 114 (citing *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, (2004) 11 ICSID Reports 361, 386, para. 98).\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee can appreciate some aspects of these criticisms. For example the *TECMED* Tribunal's apparent reliance on the foreign investor's expectations as the source of the host State's obligations (such as the obligation to compensate for expropriation) is questionable. The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have. A tribunal which sought to generate from such expectations a set of rights different from those contained in or enforceable under the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do so manifestly.\n\n68.\n\nBut however that may be, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in the account it gave of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and this for three reasons.\n\n69.\n\nThe first is that legitimate expectations generated as a result of the investor's dealings with the competent authorities of the host State may be relevant to the application of the guarantees contained in an investment treaty. This is expressly accepted by the Respondent and in the case-law.80 The Committee examines below the question of MTD's reasonable expectations deriving from the conclusion of the Foreign Investment Contracts.\n\n*See* Mr. Jan Paulsson, Expert Opinion, 22 July 2005, para. 15; *see also* Transcript of Annulment hearing at 51 (Ms. Gehring Flores).\n\n70.\n\nSecondly, in the Committee's view the formulation of the fair and equitable treatment standard adopted by the Tribunal was that contained in paragraph 113 of the Award, where it said:\n\nin terms of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. Its terms are framed as a pro-active statement - \u2018to promote,' \u2018to create,' \u2018to stimulate' - rather than prescriptions for a passive behavior of the State or avoidance of prejudicial conduct to the investors.81\n\nThe *TECMED* dictum was cited in support of this standard, not in substitution for it.\n\nAward, para. 113; *see* Award, paras. 109-13, for the Tribunal's discussion of the standard.\n\n71.\n\nThirdly, a standard formulated in the terms of paragraph 113 is defensible. No doubt the extent to which a State is obliged under the fair and equitable treatment standard to be pro-active is open to debate, but that is more a question of application of the standard than it is of formulation. In any event the emphasis in the Tribunal's formulation is on \"treatment in an even-handed and just manner.\" In particular the Tribunal does not express the obligation in such a way as to eliminate the distinction between acts and omissions or to avoid all elements of risk for the investor. That is sufficient for the purposes of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In short, in articulating this standard there is no indication that the Tribunal committed any excess of powers, let alone that it did so manifestly.\n\n**(b)** ***Failure to apply Chilean law***\n------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nAs noted above, the *lex causae* in this case based on a breach of the BIT is international law. However it will often be necessary for BIT tribunals to apply the law of the host State, and this necessity is reinforced for ICSID tribunals by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Whether the applicable law here derived from the first or second sentence of Article 42(1) does not matter: the Tribunal should have applied Chilean law to those questions which were necessary for its determination and of which Chilean law was the governing law. At the same time, the *implications* of some issue of Chilean law for a claim under the BIT were for international law to determine. In short, both laws were relevant.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal said as much. The Claimants had argued that because breach of the Foreign Investment Contracts was internationalised by reason of the umbrella clause in the Danish BIT, therefore the Contracts themselves were governed by international law. The Tribunal disagreed:\n\nThe breach of the BIT is governed by international law. However, to establish the facts of the breach, it will be necessary to consider the contractual obligations undertaken by the Respondent and the Claimants and what their scope was under Chilean Law.82\n\nAnd in fact the Tribunal applied Chilean law in holding that there had been no breach of contract by Chile:\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the authorization to invest in Chile is not a blanket authorization but only the initiation of a process to obtain the necessary permits and approvals from the various agencies and departments of the Government. It also accepts that the Government has to proceed in accordance with its own laws and policies in awarding such permits and approvals. Clause Four of the Foreign Investment Contracts would be meaningless if it were otherwise. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Chile did not breach the BIT on account of breach of the Foreign Investment Contracts.83\n\nAward, para. 187; *see also id.* paras. 86-87.\n\nAward, para. 118.\n\n74.\n\nChile complains that despite its professions that it was applying Chilean law to such questions, in fact the Tribunal did not do so:\n\nThe Tribunal fails... to mention or explain if or how it applied Chilean law to those parts of its fair and equitable determination that require an interpretation of the Foreign Investment Contracts.\n\nThe Tribunal's silence on this issue signifies that the Tribunal failed completely to apply Chilean law to determine the Parties' obligations under or to interpret the substantive meaning of the DL 600 and the Foreign Investment Contracts; thus, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power....\n\nThere is, in fact, no evidence that the Tribunal applied Chilean law. It is true that the Tribunal quoted or paraphrased parts of Articles Three and Twelve through Fifteen of Chile's Foreign Investment Law, the DL 600. But the mere repetition of the articles of the statute is clearly not the application of Chilean law. It is important to note that the Parties submitted lengthy argument, evidentiary support, and fact and expert witness testimony on Chilean law with respect to what the Tribunal coined as one of the \u2018key issues' or \u2018key element[s]' of its determination with respect to fair and equitable treatment, namely the scope of approval of the Foreign Investment Contracts. The debate at the heart of this issue was whether Chile's Foreign Investment Law (the DL 600) or the Foreign Investment Contracts approved, as the Republic of Chile asserted, merely the transfer of foreign capital, or, as MTD asserted, the proposed project in the proposed location.84\n\nChile's Annulment Memorial, paras. 130-32.\n\n75.\n\nIn considering the implications of the Foreign Investment Contracts for fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal faced a hybrid issue. The meaning of a Chilean contract is a matter of Chilean law; its implications in terms of an international law claim are a matter for international law. The Committee will return to the reasons given by the Tribunal for its decision on the implications of the FIC's conduct. For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the Tribunal applied Chilean law to issues governed by it (such as the scope of FIC authority), and that there is no indication that it mischaracterised the scope of Chilean law in its decision on the fair and equitable treatment standard. Whether it got Chilean law (or for that matter international law) right on a matter falling within its jurisdiction is not for the Committee to decide on an annulment application.\n\n**(c)** ***Unauthorised ex aequo et bono determinations***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nLargely as a corollary of the arguments discussed in the previous two sections, The Respondent argues that since \"the underpinnings of the Tribunal's determinations are unidentifiable,\" the inference should be drawn that \"the Tribunal appears to be making its determination *ex aequo et bono* (unless the Tribunal is guided, in fact, by no principles).\"85 In its Reply on the other hand, the complaint essentially concerns the damages determination. There Chile argues that:\n\nThe Tribunal's failure to make any reference to a legal precept in its reduction of the damages award leads to the conclusion that the Tribunal made this determination *ex aequo et bono*.86\n\nChile's Annulment Memorial, para. 136.\n\nChile's Annulment Reply, para. 68.\n\n77.\n\nAs a general matter there is no indication that the Tribunal asserted any jurisdiction to decide the dispute under Article 42(3) of the Convention, or that the substance of its determination was made in a law-free zone on a basis of general equity. The Committee has already dealt with the question what law the Tribunal did apply; it will deal in the following sections with the adequacy of the Tribunal's reasoning both as to substance and damages. In light of the Committee's conclusions on those issues, there is no foundation for the claim that the Tribunal exercised power to decide *ex aequo et bono*.\n\n**(4) Fair and equitable treatment: failure to state reasons**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe second major challenge to the decision on the merits concerns the Tribunal's failure to state reasons. It will be recalled that the consistent jurisprudence of annulment committees treats this head of jurisdiction in terms of absence rather than inadequacy or brevity of reasoning - \"a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.\"87 It is also established that outright or unexplained contradictions can involve a failure to state reasons.\n\n*Vivendi* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 340, 358 (para. 64): the whole passage is set out in para. 49, *supra*.\n\n79.\n\nAn initial issue concerns outright contradiction. In his Expert Opinion attached to the Rejoinder, Sir Arthur Watts noticed that there appears to be a formal contradiction in Chapter VII of the Award which contains the *dispositif*.88 In paragraph 253(1) the Tribunal expressed its principal finding as follows: \"The Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 3(1) of the BIT.\" In paragraph 253(7), the Tribunal holds that \"All other claims filed in this arbitration shall be considered dismissed.\" As noted above, the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to investments is repeated in the same terms in Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the BIT.89 If the Claimants could be considered to have made two separate claims for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, one under Article 2(2) and another under Article 3(1), then the *dispositif* might seem to have upheld one claim and rejected the other without explaining the difference between them.\n\nExpert Opinion of Sir Arthur Watts, 20 January 2006, paras. 62-71.\n\n*See supra* para. 27.\n\n80.\n\nIn truth, however, there are neither distinct obligations of fair and equitable treatment under Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the BIT, nor were there distinct claims for breach of that obligation.90 The reference to \"other claims\" in paragraph 253(7) is a reference to the various claims brought by MTD which the Tribunal dismissed, not the one claim it upheld, and the failure to refer specifically to Article 2(2) in paragraph 253(1) was without incidence for the outcome of the Award. It is not a basis for annulment.\n\n*See* the Request for Arbitration, 26 June 2001, paras. 73, 74.\n\n81.\n\nTurning to questions of substance, the Tribunal stressed the coexistence of two facts: the FIC's approval of the Project in terms which specified its location, giving rise to a legitimate expectation that the Project was at least in principle possible from a regulatory point of view, and the determination of the competent planning authorities at that time that the Project was not possible. Relying on the principle of the \"unity of the State\" vis-\u00e0-vis foreign investors, the Tribunal held that this amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 3(1). The Respondent, by argument and through expert evidence, assails these three findings as essentially unreasoned and unsupported by evidence.91 The Committee will first summarise the reasoning of the Tribunal on each of them before applying the test for annulment laid down in Article 52(1)(e).\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, paras. 138-82; Respondent's Reply, paras. 6-50; s *ee also* the Expert Opinions of Mr. Jan Paulsson attached to these pleadings.\n\n**(a)** ***The implications of FIC approval***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent attacks as unreasoned the Tribunal's finding that:\n\nApproval of a Project in a location would give *prima facie* to an investor the expectation that the project is feasible in that location from a regulatory point of view.92\n\nIt argues that \"the Tribunal fails to explain how it was in fact possible for MTD to have formulated any expectations, *prima facie* or otherwise, regarding its investment,\"93 given the evidence tendered by the Respondent that there could be no such expectation under Chilean law arising from decisions of the FIC and the absence of any evidence that MTD had any such expectation at relevant times.\n\nAward, para. 163.\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 138.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal began its consideration of the factual issues in dispute by setting out at length the arguments of the Parties.94 It had earlier set out the facts in some detail, indicating which were disputed.95 On the implications of FIC approval the following points are recorded in the Award, either as undisputed facts or as findings of the Tribunal:\n\n\u2022 The FIC was aware of the proposed Project and was consulted by MTD about it.96\n\n\u2022 The FIC was an organ of the Chilean State composed of senior ministers and officials; it was stated to have a coordinating role in the admission of investment proposals made to it. \"It is... evident from the DL 600 that the FIC is required to carry out a minimum of diligence internally and externally.\"97\n\n\u2022 The Foreign Investment Contracts, which was drafted by the FIC, unequivocally specified the location and purpose of the investment.98\n\n\u2022 Upon its conclusion the first Foreign Investment Contract bound MTD to undertake the investment; a change in the location would have required further FIC approval.99\n\n\u2022 Article 4 of the Foreign Investment Contracts made it clear that the authorization given was \"without prejudice to\" other authorisations required by Chilean laws and regulations. The FIC's authorization to invest in Chile was \"not a blanket authorization but only the initiation of a process to obtain the necessary permits and approvals from the various agencies and departments of the Government... the Government has to proceed in accordance with its own laws and policies in awarding such permits and approvals.\"100\n\n\u2022 The Project Agreement was conditional upon FIC approval of the investment.101\n\nAward, paras. 116-48.\n\nAward, paras. 39-85.\n\nAward, paras. 44, 50.\n\nAward, para. 163; *see also* Award, paras. 53, 162.\n\nAward, paras. 51, 52, 54, 57, 162.\n\nAward, paras. para. 162.\n\nAward, para. 188. For the terms of Article 4 *see supra* para. 14.\n\nAward, paras. 49, 158.\n\n**(b)** ***Chile's \"urban policy\"***\n------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the \"urban policy\" on which the Tribunal relied is unspecified and equivocal: sometimes the Tribunal presents it as the policy embodied in the PRMS, on other occasions it is presented as a policy against changing the PRMS.102 As to the latter, there was no such policy - and certainly not at the time of FIC approval of the investment. As to the former, MTD was aware of the need for planning approval under the PRMS.\n\nRespondent's Annulment Reply, paras. 9-26. A point also forcefully made in the two Paulsson opinions.\n\n85.\n\nOn this question, the Tribunal found as follows:\n\n\u2022 At the time the Project was approved by the FIC, the SEREMI was of the view (and had informed the Minister) that it could not be implemented.103 He never deviated from that view.104\n\n\u2022 The Minister did not attend the relevant FIC meetings, despite provision for attendance of other relevant ministers in DL 600.105\n\n\u2022 There was no proof that MTD was aware of the SEREMI's opposition to the Project before the signature of the Foreign Investment Contracts; it was \"reasonable to assume\" that no categorical warnings had been given to MTD as alleged by Chile.106\n\n\u2022 The first written notification from Chile to MTD that the Project was unlikely to be approved was the SEREMI's letter of June 3, 1998.107\n\nAward, paras. 74, 151, 154.\n\nAward, paras. 66, 72, 74, 75, 79, 80.\n\nAward, paras. 53, 161-63.\n\nAward, para. 158; *see also* Award, para. 166.\n\nAward, para. 165.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"the policy against changing the zoning of El Principal and modifying the PMRS\"108 had not been formed at the time of the first FIC decision. It also argues that the idea of such a \"meta-policy\" makes no sense: there was nothing but the PRMS and a discretion to modify it or not, a discretion which it was entirely for Chile to exercise. As to this, two points may be made. The first is that Chile's position before the Tribunal was that the policy against urban development in Pirque already existed at that time of the first FIC approval.109 The second point is that there was evidence before the Tribunal, recorded in the Award, that the position of the planning authorities never changed.110\n\nAward, para. 165.\n\n*Cf*. *supra* para. 31.\n\n*Cf*. Award, para. 80.\n\n**(c)** ***Inconsistency of Chilean conduct and the \"unity of the State\"***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nEvidently the Tribunal placed considerable emphasis on \"the unity of the State\" in reaching its determination under Article 3(1). It refers to the point no fewer that four times:\n\nWhat the Tribunal emphasizes here is the inconsistency of action between two arms of the same Government *vis-\u00e0-vis* the same investor even when the legal framework of the country provides for a mechanism to coordinate.111\n\n[I]n the case before us, Chile is not a passive party and the coherent action of the various officials through which Chile acts is the responsibility of Chile, not of the investor.112\n\nChile also has an obligation to act coherently and apply its policies consistently, independently of how diligent an investor is. Under international law (the law that this Tribunal has to apply to a dispute under the BIT), the State of Chile needs to be considered by the Tribunal as a unit.113\n\nMinister Hermosilla and the FIC were different channels of communication of the Respondent with outside parties, but, for purposes of the obligations of Chile under the BIT, they represented Chile as a unit, as a monolith, to use the Respondent's term.114\n\nAward, para. 164.\n\nAward, para. 164.\n\nAward, para. 165.\n\nAward, para. 166.\n\n88.\n\nIn Chile's view this ignores the law of the host State and the necessary separation of powers which is the basis for the rule of law. Organs of the State can have different mandates and concerns: inconsistency of policy between them does not necessarily entail any breach of international law. Just because the decisions of the FIC are attributable to the State of Chile is no reason to accord the FIC more authority than it actually had, and to do so is to confuse the distinct concepts of attribution and breach. Despite the Tribunal's repetition of the \"unity\" argument, it is left essentially unexplained.115\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Annulment Reply, paras. 62-65.\n\n89.\n\nThe Committee agrees that to mix up attribution and breach would require explanation and would indicate confusion. But it does not agree that the Tribunal committed such an error. For example the conduct of the Mayor of Pirque in his official capacity was attributable to the State,116 but the Tribunal did not suggest that this gave rise to any issue under the BIT. Its point was that the FIC was a senior agency of the State whose formal acts could be regarded as significant in terms of the admission of investment: this, as has been seen, it explained.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Case concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.a. (ELSI)*, ICJ Reports 1989 at 15, 48-49 (concerning the Mayor of Palermo).\n\n**(d)** ***Conclusion***\n------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe question for the Committee is not whether the Tribunal's reasoning is unassailable but whether it is annullable under Article 52(1)(e). This is in the end a matter of appreciation, bearing in mind the distinction between annulment and appeal.117\n\n*See supra* paras. 48-52.\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee would make the following points. First, the notion of regulatory feasibility developed by the Tribunal (and applied consistently by it) is not a notion of Chilean law and was not presented as such: it was put forward in the context of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Secondly, it is not incoherent or contradictory to say that in a given situation a Project may go forward for regulatory assessment on the basis that it might be approved in accordance with the law of the host State. The Tribunal did not contradict itself in holding, on the one hand, that MTD could have expected from its contacts and contracts with the FIC that the Project was possible and, on the other hand, that it had no right to planning permission. Thirdly, there was material before the Tribunal - not least the letter of SEREMI Gonz\u00e1lez of 3 June 1998 - which supported the Tribunal's conclusion that the competent authorities were at no stage prepared to consider the Project as feasible from a regulatory perspective. The Respondent's version of the meeting of 6 November 1996 was also consistent with this conclusion (and the Claimants' version did not contradict it).118 Fourthly, it was open to the Tribunal to stress, from the perspective of the protection of foreign investment, the mandate and composition of the FIC; at any rate the Tribunal clearly addressed that issue at some length in its reasoning. Moreover it did so not from the point of view of attribution - it is undisputed that the FIC is an organ of the Chilean State and that foreign investment contracts are concluded by the FIC on behalf of the State - but from the point of view of the significance to be attached to the legal act of contracting for a Project in a specified location.\n\nMTD argued, and seems to have shown, that none of its senior representatives were present. There was evidence that Mr. Fontaine attended but it is not suggested that he represented MTD.\n\n92.\n\nIn the end the question is whether an informed reader of the Award would understand the reasons given by the Tribunal and would discern no material contradiction in them. In the Committee's view the answer to that question in the present case is that the reasons are sufficiently clear and sufficiently displayed and that they entail no contradiction: thus the case for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) fails.\n\n**(5) Contributory fault**\n--------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding on this point has already been noted.119 The Respondent attacks it on two basic grounds, both alleging a failure to state reasons.\n\n*See supra* paras. 37-38.\n\n94.\n\nThe first concerns causation. In the Respondent's view the Tribunal's own findings as to the due application of Chilean law meant that the Project could never have gone ahead in any event. There is in its view a fundamental discrepancy between the finding that the Foreign Investment Contract gave MTD no right to planning permission (and related findings that applications were properly rejected by the competent Chilean authorities), on the one hand, and the decision that Chile caused any part of the loss, on the other. The Respondent takes as an example the rejection by COREMA (the *Comisi\u00f3n Regional del Medio Ambiente, Regi\u00f3n Metropolitana*) of an environmental impact statement for the Project:\n\nThe Tribunal's finding that the COREMA acted properly in rejecting the EIS is significant as it means that even if the PRMS could have been modified, MTD could not have gone forward with its project because the COREMA had, as the Tribunal itself found, validly rejected it. It is astounding that the Tribunal recognizes this outcome but does nothing to dispose of the obvious conflict. Based on the foregoing, it is unclear how the Tribunal could find that Chile is directly responsible for MTD's alleged damages. It is even more inconceivable that the Tribunal could announce its finding without providing any explanation as to how it arrived at its conclusion.120\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 189.\n\n95.\n\nAs the Tribunal recorded, the environmental impact statement was part of an effort by the Pirque Municipal Council to avoid the impact of the PRMS through getting approval for a Sectional Plan. The Sectional Plan proposal was submitted on 11 August 1998; the related environmental impact statement was submitted on 8 September 1998 and rejected on 26 November 1998, after the Minister had finally informed MTD that the PRMS could neither be modified nor avoided.121 The principal reason COREMA rejected the environmental impact statement - unsurprisingly - was that it was incompatible with the existing zoning for the land, as just affirmed by the Minister.122\n\nAward, paras. 77, 81, 148.\n\nAward, para. 195 (noting that there were other subsidiary reasons).\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal considered the issue of the COREMA rejection, rather briefly, under the rubric of the claim concerning unreasonable and discriminatory measures. It said:\n\nTo a certain extent, this claim has been considered by the Tribunal as part of the fair and equitable treatment. The approval of an investment against the Government urban policy can be equally considered unreasonable. On the other hand, the changes of the PMRS related to Chacabuco or more recently Modification 48, as explained by the Respondent, do not dispense with specific changes of the PMRS when the land is zoned of '*silvoagropecuario* interest.' Therefore, there is no basis for considering the modifications made to PMRS as discriminatory. The Tribunal is also satisfied by the explanation regarding the rejection of the EIS by COREMA.123\n\nAward, para. 196.\n\n97.\n\nWhat the Respondent presents as a question of causation is only addressed by inference in this passage. But the reason is perfectly clear: the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard discerned by the Committee was not any of the subsequent decisions by Chilean agencies declining to allow the Project.124 What was held to be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard was the act of the FIC, an organ of the Chilean State, in approving a specific investment by reference to a location where the investment was not possible to be implemented. The Tribunal's finding to that effect has withstood an annulment challenge, for the reasons given above. Without the FIC's decision to admit the investment, the loss would not have occurred. By contrast no separate question of causation arose with respect to COREMA's decision of 26 November 1998, or any of the other decisions under Chilean law. The position would have been different had the Tribunal awarded damages by way of *lucrum cessans* for the loss of the Project but it did not, given that MTD never acquired any right to have the Project go ahead.\n\n\"It was the policy of the Respondent and its right not to change it. For the same reason, it was unfair to admit the investment in the country in the first place.\" Award, para. 214.\n\n98.\n\nThe second ground of complaint as to this finding is that, even if some apportionment of responsibility was appropriate (a process referred to in Respondent's pleadings as comparative negligence)125 the Tribunal gave no reason for apportioning the loss on a 50:50 basis:\n\nDue to the Tribunal's failure to state its reasons upon which it diminished the Award by an arbitrary and unexplained fifty percent (and not 100 percent), as well as its manifest failure to apply any law that the Parties agreed to in the BIT (whether the Tribunal applied equity or other unidentified precepts to make its fifty percent reduction), the Award must be annulled.126\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 193.\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 194.\n\n99.\n\nIt may be noted that the Respondent does not challenge the decision on contribution as a manifest excess of powers, and rightly not. In the words of Article 39 of the ILC's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of 2001:\n\n\" Contribution to the injury\n\nIn the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.\"\n\nPart II of the ILC Articles, in which Article 39 is located, is concerned with claims between States, though it includes claims brought on behalf of individuals, e.g., within the framework of diplomatic protection.127 There is no reason not to apply the same principle of contribution to claims for breach of treaty brought by individuals.\n\n*See* ILC Articles, Art. 33(2) and commentary, para. (4).\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal had found a breach of treaty at the time of the admission of the investment: without the act constituting the breach (the decision of the FIC), the investment would not have gone ahead. At the same time the Tribunal found that MTD had significantly contributed to its own loss, in the manner explained in some detail in the Award. The issue of contribution being thereby raised, the Tribunal proceeded forthwith to an appreciation of the comparative contribution. It estimated MTD's contribution to the damage to be 50% \"after deduction of the residual value of their investment calculated on the basis of the following considerations.\"128\n\nAward, paras. 242-43.\n\n101.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Respondent that some further reasons for a 50:50 split of damages could have been offered at this stage. But the Tribunal had already analysed the faults on both sides in some detail, holding both to be material and significant in the circumstances. As is often the case with situations of comparative fault, the role of the two parties contributing to the loss was very different and only with difficulty commensurable, and the Tribunal had a corresponding margin of estimation. Furthermore, in an investment treaty claim where contribution is relevant, the respondent's breach will normally be regulatory in character, whereas the claimant's conduct will be different, a failure to safeguard its own interests rather than a breach of any duty owed to the host State. In such circumstances, it is not unusual for the loss to be shared equally. International tribunals which have reached this point have often not given any \"exact explanation\" of the calculations involved.129 In the event, the Tribunal having analysed at some length the failings of the two parties, there was little more to be said - and no annullable error in not saying it.\n\nAs Gray notes in relation to the *Costa Rica Packet* case (1897): C Gray, *Judicial Remedies in International Law* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1987) 23. In that case Arbitrator Martens said little more than that \"the losses sustained... are not entirely the necessary consequences of this precautionary detention\": 5 Moore, *International Arbitrations* (1898) 4948, 4953.\n\n**(6) The assessment of damages**\n---------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe final area of controversy concerns the assessment of damages. The Respondent objects to this determination on two grounds.\n\n103.\n\nFirst, it objects that the Tribunal gave no reason \"for holding Chile responsible for the unreasonable price paid for the land.\"130 What the Tribunal did, as noted, was to take the price actually paid, to deduct the amount which MTD should have accepted for the land when offered by the vendor, and to halve the resulting amount because of MTD's failure to protect itself, a failure which included its failure to protect itself against a refusal of planning permission. In the context, in the Committee's view, the procedure adopted by the Tribunal was adequately explained.\n\nRespondent's Annulment Reply at 55.\n\n104.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent complains of the arbitrary and unexplained way in which, it says, the Tribunal fixed the cut-off date for taking into account as damages the expenses incurred by MTD on the Project:131\n\nThe Tribunal fails to explain why it used Minister Henr\u00edquez' letter of 4 November 1998 as the point after which MTD's expenditures would be excluded from the damages calculation. The Republic of Chile presented evidence to the Tribunal of several meetings between MTD and Chilean government officials, which occurred before Minister Henr\u00edquez' letter was written, that could have been used as alternative cut-off dates \u2014 as well as points at which MTD could have mitigated its losses \u2014 for the Tribunal's damages determinations. During these various meetings the Republic of Chile contended that MTD was warned of the regulatory obstacles facing its Project, but the Tribunal fails to determine the substance of many of these meetings.132\n\nAnd it goes on to list a series of \"dates the Tribunal could have used as alternative cut-off dates for its damages determination.\"133 In failing to explain the choice of 4 November 1998, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which a material part of the decision was based.134\n\n*See supra* para. 39 for the Tribunal's determination on this point.\n\nRespondent's Annulment Memorial, para. 195.\n\n*Id.* para. 196.\n\nIt is also said to be a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. *Id.*, para. 203. The Committee has already dealt with this as a separate ground for annulment. *See supra* paras. 55-56.\n\n105.\n\nIn the passage cited above (as elsewhere in its pleadings), the Respondent misconceives the basis on which the Tribunal made its decision. Had the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard depended on what was said at particular meetings with Chilean officials prior to the conclusion of the first Foreign Investment Contract, it would have been necessary for the Tribunal to make definitive findings as the content of those meetings.135 But this was not the basis for the decision. Rather the Tribunal emphasised that, an organ of the Chilean State having formally agreed in a written contract for the importation of substantial foreign capital for this specific Project, it was not until 3 June 1998 that an official statement that it would be \" *inconveniente* \" (i.e., inappropriate) to amend the PRMS was made to MTD in writing, and not until 4 November 1998 that the responsible Minister made it clear in writing that the Project would not proceed. The reasons for the Tribunal's decision in that regard were - as the Committee has already held - given in the Award. That being so it is not to the point that the cut-off for calculation of expenditures failed to take into account what may have been said at prior meetings.\n\nAlternatively, to the extent that things said at those meetings were relied on by the Respondent by way of defence, the Tribunal would have had to hold that the content of the meetings had not been proved.\n\n106.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal having held that there was a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard as a result of the Foreign Investment Contract concluded on 18 March 1997, the question to be determined was for how long thereafter it was reasonable for the MTD to incur expenses in the quest for a change in the PRMS to allow the Project to take place. The Tribunal cited the Claimants' argument that, having made the major authorized commitment of capital in early 1997, \"it was reasonable and consistent with MTD's obligation to mitigate damages for MTD to continue seeking Government approvals even after it became apparent that Government officials were opposing the Project.\"136 The Tribunal took as the cut-off date 4 November 1998, the date on which the Minister finally informed MTD in writing of his decision that the PRMS would not be changed. In effect, an organ composed of Chilean officials of ministerial rank having admitted in writing the investment, the Tribunal held that it was reasonable for the Claimants to continue to incur expenditure in quest of the Project until a final and definitive ministerial decision was made and communicated in writing to them that their quest could not succeed. The Committee agrees with the Respondent that the reasons given by Tribunal for this aspect of its quantum decision were extremely succinct. But they were not elusive. In the circumstances the Committee is not prepared to annul this minor aspect of the decision under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\nAward, para. 114 (quoting Rejoinder, para. 131).\n\n**(7) Conclusions**\n-------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn the event the Respondent's application for annulment must be dismissed. But the Committee would wish to emphasise again the actual basis on which the Tribunal's decision has been upheld. In the present case, a foreign investor failed to complete due diligence on a point fundamental to the investment. Land-use control is a core concern for the State, especially in the peripheries of urban areas. Whatever contracts foreign investors may make with the owners of rural land cannot be allowed to disrupt the due application of the law of the host State, nor should the vagueness inherent in such treaty standards as \"fair and equitable treatment\" allow international tribunals to second-guess planning decisions duly made (as the decisions here were made) in accordance with that law.\n\n108.\n\nBut criticism of the Tribunal on such grounds misapprehends the very specific basis of its decision, one which it was open to the Tribunal to reach. The Tribunal itself upheld the authority of Chilean planning law against arguments based on a \"right to planning permission.\"137 But the flow of foreign investment is also important and the State has undertaken obligations in this regard. In the event what emerged with credit from the examination was the planning process; what could do with improvement, as the Tribunal itself pointed out,138 was co-ordination at the level of the FIC.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Award, para. 188.\n\nAward, para. 163.\n\n**F. COSTS**\n------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Award not having been annulled, the ruling on the costs of the proceedings before the Tribunal stands and the stay of enforcement is automatically lifted as from the date of this Decision (Arbitration Rule 54(3)).\n\n110.\n\nIt remains to deal with the question of the costs of these annulment proceedings, as to which the Committee has a discretion. In all but one of the concluded annulment proceedings, Committees have made no order for the parties' own costs and have held that ICSID's costs should be borne equally by the parties. They did so not only where the application for annulment succeeded in whole or part but also where it failed.139 In the latter cases, the party successful, at least in part before the Tribunal, and successful in any case before the committee had to pay half the costs resulting from the request for annulment.\n\nIn the following seven cases, committees declined to order party costs against the unsuccessful party and split ICSID's costs of the proceedings: *Klockner* (1985) 2 ICSID Reports 4, 163; *Amco Asia I* (1986) 1 ICSID Reports 509, 542; *MINE* (1989) 4 *ICSID Reports* 79, 110; *Amco Asia II* (1992) 9 ICSID Reports 3; *Wena Hotels* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 129, 152; *Vivendi* (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 340, 371; *Mitchell v DRC*, decision of 1 November 2006, para 67.\n\n111.\n\nThis result might be thought anomalous. However, in the interest of consistency of ICSID jurisprudence and in the circumstances of the present case, the Committee proposes to follow the existing practice. It does so noting that this practice is not without flexibility and admits of exception. In this regard, it observes that in *CDC Group PLC v Republic of the Seychelles*, the committee ordered the unsuccessful respondent to pay both the claimant's and ICSID's costs of the annulment proceedings. The committee noted that the annulment application was \"fundamentally lacking in merit\" and that the respondent's case was \"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.\"140 The same cannot be said here. As the Committee has already observed, Chile has expressed reasonable concerns transcending the amounts at stake.\n\n(2005) 11 ICSID Reports 237, 266 (para. 89).\n\n112.\n\nThe costs of the parties' own representation during the annulment proceedings are likewise within the Committee's discretion. The present case involved a complex and novel question of public importance concerning the assessment of regulatory risk in a case where a formal contract of foreign investment was concluded specifying the location of the investment. Taking into account that both parties were held to be at fault in relation to the dispute, the Committee decides to make no order as to the costs of representation before it.\n\n**G. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n113.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES:\n\n(1) The Respondent's request for annulment is dismissed.\n\n(2) Each party shall bear one half of the costs incurred by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(3) Each Party shall bear its own costs of representation in connection with this annulment proceeding."}]}
