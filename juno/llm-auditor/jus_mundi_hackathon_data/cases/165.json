INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Mr Dawood Ajum Rawat ***(Rawat),*** is pursuing this arbitration against the Respondent, the Republic of Mauritius ***(Mauritius),*** to claim for alleged breaches of the Investment Promotion Treaty entered into on 22 March 1973 between the Republic of France and Mauritius ***(France-Mauritius BIT).*****1** Rawat brings this arbitration under the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules ***(UNCITRAL Rules)*** through the Most Favored Nation ***(MFN)*** clause in the France-Mauritius BIT and the arbitration clause in the 2007 Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the Promotion and Protection of Investments ***(Finland-Mauritius BIT).*****2**\n\n*Convention entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de l\u2019Ile Maurice sur la protection des investissements, sign\u00e9e \u00e0 Port-Louis le 22 mars 1973* (Exh C-l). The authentic language of the France-Mauritius BIT is French.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 12 September 2007 (Exh C-2).\n\n2.\n\nIn brief, Rawat alleges that Mauritius violated the France-Mauritius BIT by freezing and misappropriating his protected investment in the group of companies known as British American Investment Co. (Mtius) Ltd ***(BAICM Group),*** which includes the Bramer Banking Corporation Ltd ***(Branier Bank).***  He seeks compensation for these alleged treaty breaches in an amount exceeding US$ 1 billion. Mauritius does not dispute that certain of the actions alleged by Rawat have occurred, but denies any violation of its obligations under the France-Mauritius BIT. According to Mauritius, the freeze of Rawat\u2019s personal and business assets and related actions are part of an ongoing, and legal, investigation of alleged Ponzi-like schemes orchestrated by him and/or his family members, involving money laundering and fraud at the level of MUR 1 billion.\n\n3.\n\nBoth Parties have submitted applications for interim measures in this Initial Phase of the arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nFirst, Rawat requests the Tribunal to order Mauritius to fund the entire advance on costs directly or by unfreezing certain of his bank accounts and real property and/or releasing certain documents to potential third party funders; to enjoin Mauritius from continuing alleged retaliation measures against his family; and to enjoin Mauritius from taking action aggravating the dispute such as media campaigns and retaliatory measures. Second, Mauritius seeks \u20ac 3 million in security for costs.\n\n5.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal denies both applications, with leave to re-apply.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 8 June 2015, Rawat sent a Notice of Dispute to Mauritius, through his legal representatives Dr Andrea Pinna and Prof Xavier Boucobza. By letter dated 11 September 2015, through its appointed legal representatives LALIVE SA, Mauritius informed Rawat that it found no basis in the France-Mauritius BIT for his claims.\n\n7.\n\nOn 9 November 2015, Rawat sent a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim to Mauritius ***(Notice of Arbitration).***\n\n8.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, Rawat notified Mauritius of his appointment of Mr Jean-Christophe Honlet as the first arbitrator. By letter dated 9 December 2015, Mauritius notified Rawat of its appointment of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC as the second arbitrator. By Rawat\u2019s letter dated 6 May 2016 and Mauritius\u2019 letter dated 15 May 2016, the Parties appointed Professor Lucy Reed as Presiding Arbitrator of the Tribunal. In paragraph 4.4 of the Terms of Appointment executed on 2 September 2016, the Parties confirmed that the members of the Tribunal have been validly appointed in accordance with the France-Mauritius BIT, the Finland-Mauritius BIT and the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n9.\n\nPursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and as confirmed in paragraph 2.6 of the Terms of Appointment, these proceedings are deemed to have commenced on 9 November 2015, the date on which the Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n10.\n\nBy email dated 31 May 2016, counsel for Mauritius sent the Tribunal drafts of the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1, prepared jointly by the Parties. The drafts highlighted remaining differences between the Parties, notably the place of arbitration, the language of arbitration, and the responsibility to pay the advance on costs.\n\n11.\n\nBy email also dated 31 May 2016, Rawat indicated his intention to request that Mauritius bear the entire advance on costs:\n\n*As regards the advance on costs, Mr Dawood Rawat has seen in April 2015 all of its assets in Mauritius (i) either appropriated (it is Claimant's position that they have been misappropriated) by the Republic of Mauritius (ii) or frozen. As a consequence of the actions of the Republic of Mauritius, the Claimant is not in a position to finance the advance of costs in this arbitration. It is Claimant's intention to ask the Tribunal by way of an application of interim relief to decide that the advance of costs will be paid in full by the Republic of Mauritius.*\n\n*The abovementioned application will also include other requests for interim relief.*\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 31 May 2016, Mauritius indicated its intention to seek termination of the case should Rawat refuse to contribute his equal share of the advance on costs - in this arbitration, which he had commenced against Mauritius - in violation of Article 41 (1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n13.\n\nAfter further exchanges of correspondence, the Tribunal conducted a procedural conference call with counsel for the Parties on 9 June 2016 to address the Initial Phase of the arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 15 June 2016. Procedural Order No. 1 provides in full:\n\n*We agree with the Claimant that it is premature to rule on its request to shift responsibility for the advance on costs without allowing the Parties to make full submissions. We also consider it premature to terminate the case, without having yet ordered deposits of an advance on costs.*\n\n*We appreciate counsel\u2019s agreement during the conference call that the Tribunal is validly constituted and the proceedings are validly underway under the Rules. Given this status, and in light of Article 39 of the Rules, which allows an UNCITRAL tribunal to fix its fees, we find that an executed Terms of Appointment is not necessary for us to exercise our jurisdiction and to set advances on costs and order deposits.*\n\n*We agree with the Respondent that, without prejudice to the final decision of the Tribunal on the requested shifting of advances and other interim relief requested, the first step at least under Article 41(1) of the Rules has to be to request deposits from both Parties in equal shares.*\n\n*We have determined to set an advance on costs for an initial phase of proceedings (\"Phase 1\")* [also called the Initial Phase] *of Euro 100,000 to cover: (a) the Tribunal members\u2019 fees and expenses to date for pre- and post-constitution services; (b) the Claimant\u2019s anticipated application for interim measures to shift responsibility for the full advances on costs to the Respondent, including the Respondent\u2019s anticipated defenses; (c) the Respondent\u2019s anticipated application for security for costs for the interim measures application; (d) the review of both Parties\u2019 arguments regarding the place and language(s) of the arbitration; and (e) the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on the applications on the basis of written submissions only. If either Party demands a hearing on any application, we will have to revisit the amount of the advance for Phase 1.*\n\n*Subject to the Parties' compliance with the steps ordered below and related developments, the Tribunal expects to issue a Procedural Order No. 2 based on the Parties\u2019 draft Procedural Order No. 1, with the addition of the place and language of the arbitration and any other direction that the Tribunal may deem proper at that time. Also dependent on developments, the Tribunal would expect to issue a further Procedural Order for a jurisdictional objections phase.*\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Order below regarding the administration of the arbitration by the Permanent Court of Arbitration or such other administering institution as the Parties may agree, as well as the language used in this Order, are without prejudice to the ultimate decision of the Tribunal regarding the place and language(s) of the arbitration.*\n\n*In light of all of the above, the Tribunal ORDERS as follows:*\n\n*1. By 17 June 2016, the Parties are jointly to request the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA or such other administering institution as they may agree, to administer this arbitration, and copy the Tribunal on all relevant correspondence.*\n\n*2. By 13 July 2016, each Party is to deposit one-half of the Phase 1 advance on costs, in the amount of Euro 50,000, with the PCA or substitute administering institution.*\n\n*....*\n\n15.\n\nBy email dated 17 June 2016, in response to inquiries from the Parties, the Tribunal clarified the role for an administering institution as follows:\n\n*... Procedural Order No. 1 does not require the Parties to agree to full administration by the PCA or other institution. We expect the Parties to discuss the various administration options available from the PCA and other institutions, for example the LCIA. Most important is collection and management of deposits toward the advance on costs for Phase 1, as the Tribunal members are not in a position to open and manage an escrow account.*\n\n16.\n\nThe Parties proceeded to arrange depository services with the PCA. By email dated 14 July 2016, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Respondent\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s deposits of \u20ac 50,000 for the Initial Phase on 30 June and 12 July 2016, respectively.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on 12 August 2016. Procedural Order No. 2 establishes Brussels as the place of arbitration and English as the language of arbitration, and annexed the procedural calendar for the Initial Phase. The Initial Phase is described to include the Claimant\u2019s *'\"request for interim measures to shift responsibility for the full advances on costs to the Respondent\"* and the Respondent\u2019s *\"application for security for costs in relation\"* to the Claimant\u2019s interim measures request.\n\n18.\n\nOn 1 August 2016 (before the 5 September deadline), Rawat submitted his Request for Interim Measures ***(Rawat Request).*** The Rawat Request includes 10 witness declarations, including the Witness Statement of Rawat dated 29 July 2016 ***(Rawat Witness Statement)*** 65 documentary exhibits, and six legal authorities. The full Request for Relief in the Request for Interim Measures is set out below in Section V.\n\n19.\n\nThe Terms of Appointment were executed and finalized on 2 September 2016.\n\n20.\n\nOn 5 September 2016, Mauritius submitted its Application for Security for Costs ***(Mauritius Application).*** The Mauritius Application includes four documentary exhibits and 20 legal authorities. The full Prayers for Relief in the Mauritius Application are set out below in Section VI.\n\n21.\n\nOn 26 September 2016, Mauritius submitted its Answer to the Rawat Request with 22 legal authorities. On the same date, Rawat submitted his Answer to the Mauritius Application with five additional documentary exhibits, and one additional legal authority.\n\n22.\n\nOn 10 October 2016, Mauritius submitted its Reply to Claimant\u2019s Answer with three witness statements, three additional documentary exhibits, and four additional legal authorities. On the same date, Rawat submitted his Reply to Respondent\u2019s Answer with three additional documentary exhibits and one additional legal authority.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 14 October 2016, Rawat asked the Tribunal to direct Mauritius to indicate whether two of his properties, described as his *\"former residence in Mauritius and the villa at La Preneuse\"* were subject to freezing orders in Mauritius.\n\n24.\n\nOn 16 October 2016, with leave of the Tribunal, Mauritius submitted six new exhibits related to Mauritian court proceedings involving, among others, Rawat\u2019s daughter, Ms Laina Rawat.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 17 October 2016, Rawat asked to submit a short declaration of Ms Rawat explaining her motivation to discontinue her request for appointment of a new receiver to represent Bramer Bank in Mauritian court proceedings.\n\n26.\n\nAs envisioned in Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal conducted a procedural conference call on 17 October 2016 *\"to consider hearing requests and next steps for the Initial Phase\".* As neither Party had requested a hearing, the Tribunal confirmed that it would decide the Rawat Request and the Mauritius Application on the written submissions. During the conference call, counsel addressed Rawat\u2019s requests in his letters of 14 and 17 October 2016 and, at the request of the Tribunal, the question of *prima facie* jurisdiction for the Initial Phase in relation to the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n27.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal ordered as follows:\n\n*1. The Parties are to consult on the status of the two properties that are the subject of the Claimants letter dated 14 October 2016, namely a former residence and a villa at La Preneuse, as to whether the properties are subject to a freezing order or not, and to report to the Tribunal by 25 October 2016;*\n\n*2. The Parties are to file any further legal submissions on the issue of prima facie jurisdiction in relation to the Most Favored Nation provision of the France-Mauritius bilateral investment treaty dated 22 March 1973, also by 25 October 2016; and*\n\n*3. The Claimant s request by letter of 17 October 2016 to submit the short declaration of Ms Laina Rawat, explaining the motivation of her decision, as effected through her counsel\u2019s letter dated 18 July 2016 (Exh R-12), to discontinue the request for appointment of a new receiver to Bramer Bank to represent the latter in legal proceedings, is granted, and the declaration is to be filed by 19 October 2016.*\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 October 2016, Rawat submitted Ms Laina Rawat\u2019s declaration dated 17 October 2016 ***(Laina Rawat Declaration),*** which annexed three documents from the Mauritian Supreme Court case of *Laina Dawood Rawat* v *Financial Intelligence Unit* (Serial No. 914/2016). By letter dated 20 October 2016, Mauritius requested the Tribunal to exclude the Declaration from the record as being outside the scope of Procedural Order No. 3 or, in the alternative, to afford the Declaration no weight. On 21 October 2016, Rawat responded. By Procedural Direction dated 22 October 2016, the Tribunal *\"determined not to strike the Declaration, with the assurance that* we *will give it \u2014 like all the evidence in the record \u2014 appropriate weight in our future analysis and decisions\",* and directed Mauritius to submit any reply to the Declaration by 28 October 2016. In its reply of 28 October 2016, Mauritius challenged the accuracy and relevance of the Declaration, and underscored that Ms Rawat is receiving MUR 100,000 monthly pursuant to a September 2015 court order; Mauritius attached a copy of the relevant agreement as Exh R-16.\n\n29.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Rawat filed its Submission on the Issue of *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction in Relation to the Most Favoured Nation Provision of the France-Mauritius Bilateral Investment Treaty, with three additional documentary exhibits, and five additional legal authorities.\n\n30.\n\nAlso on 25 October 2016, Mauritius filed its Supplementary Submission on *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction, with two documentary exhibits and 16 legal authorities. By letter dated 2 November 2016, Rawat commented on Mauritius\u2019 discussion in its Supplementary Submission of the 2010 France-Mauritius bilateral investment treaty, which has not yet entered into force.\n\n31.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, Mauritius informed the Tribunal that the two properties Rawat had inquired about - his former residence and the villa at La Preneuse -are not on the list of his frozen properties but that they are subject to charges granted by him to creditors.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n32.\n\nAt this Initial Phase of the proceedings, none of the facts alleged by the Parties has been tested. In ruling on Rawat\u2019s Request for Interim Measures and Mauritius\u2019 Application, we are to take the facts alleged by Rawat as true, without prejudice to our findings at any further stage of this arbitration. Nothing in this Decision is to be construed otherwise.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal below summarizes the alleged facts necessary to place the Parties\u2019 interim measures requests in context.\n\n34.\n\nRawat alleges that he ultimately owns and controls the BAICM Group, including Bramer Bank, and that his indirect ownership of shares in BAICM is an *\"investment\"* under the France-Mauritius BIT. He accuses Mauritius of a series of actions violating its obligations under the France-Mauritius BIT to protect a US$ 1 billion investment. The alleged violations include: a campaign of premature encashment by Government of Mauritius officials and Government-related entities of funds from their Bramer Bank accounts; revocation of Bramer Bank\u2019s Banking License; appointment of receivers for Bramer Bank and transfer of Bramer Bank assets to a company wholly-owned by Mauritius for a value far below their market value; appointment of conservators for BAICM affiliate British American Insurance Company Ltd ***(BAI);*** improper enactment of the Mauritius Insurance (Amendment) Act 2015 with a retroactive effect applying to BAI; appointment of special administrators for BAI and all BAICM Group companies; and disposal of assets of BAICM Group companies to the benefit of Mauritius or third parties.\n\n35.\n\nIn May 2015, the Bank of Mauritius commissioned an investigation of BAICM Group activities from nTan, an accounting firm based in Singapore, into the activities of the BAICM Group from 2007 through 2014. According to the nTan interim report dated 27 January 2016 ***(nTan Report),*** which is publicly available, BAICM Group liabilities exceeded assets by MUR 12 billion by the end of financial year 2013, which the Group was able to hide by operating Ponzi-like schemes. As characterized by Mauritius, the nTan Report sets out evidence that the BAICM Group channelled funds exceeding MUR 1 billion to Rawat and/or his family members. The nTan Report caveats that the investigation proceeded without informing all individuals and entities investigated, and such individuals and entities were not provided the opportunity to offer comments or corrections and \"[t]his *report should be read subject to this limitation\"* (Exh C-34, page i).\n\n36.\n\nRawat is currently facing a warrant of arrest in Mauritius for money laundering, conspiracy to defraud, and misuse of company assets. Rawat, who remains outside Mauritius, has not been convicted of any of these crimes. According to Mauritius, as a matter of Mauritian criminal law, Rawat faces \"provisional charges\" until he can be physically presented before a judge. Receivers of Rawat\u2019s companies have also initiated civil suits in Mauritius, in which Rawat and various family members are named defendants.\n\n37.\n\nRawat\u2019s daughters Laina and Adeela Rawat and sons-in-law Brian Burns and Claudio Feistritzer have been questioned by Mauritius\u2019 Central Criminal Investigation Department; and arrested and provisionally charged for money laundering, conspiracy to defraud, misuse of company property, and giving false statements. According to both Parties, all are currently free on bail. They are barred from leaving Mauritius by operation of an Objection to Departure issued by the Mauritius Passport and Immigration Office, and have had to surrender their passports to the Mauritius courts.\n\n38.\n\nIn connection with the investigation, the Mauritian Supreme Court issued an Order on 18 April 2015 listing immovable properties allegedly belonging to Rawat that *\"shall not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with, by any person, except upon a Judge\u2019s Order\"3* (Exh C-29). As reported by Mauritius in its submission of 4 November 2016, this Order was extended for one year on 18 April 2016 (Exh R-17). The two properties that Rawat has inquired about in these proceedings - a former residence and the Villa La Preneuse - are not on the list of frozen properties. According to Mauritius in its 4 November 2016 submission:\n\n*The Respondent has however been informed that the Two Properties are subject to several fixed and floating charges granted by Mr Rawat to his creditors as security for loans and other credit facilities, including (but not necessarily solely) from companies of the BAI Group and Bramer Bank. We understand that these charges may preclude the Claimant from disposing of the Two Properties.*\n\nOrder issued by Her Ladyship, Mrs Gaytree Jugessui-Manna, Judge of the Supreme Court of Mauritius sitting in Chambers dated 18 April 2015, p. 2 (Exh C-29).\n\n39.\n\nThe freezing order also covers the assets of several of Rawat\u2019s family members, who have also lost their employment with BAICM Group companies. Laina Rawat and other of Rawat\u2019s immediate family members do receive funds for living expenses in Mauritius.\n\n40.\n\nAccording to Rawat, Mauritius has orchestrated a negative media campaign against him and his family.\n\n41.\n\nIn the Request for Interim Measures (paras. 60-62), Rawat states that he has no assets available for living except those in foreign countries and, of those, he has been obliged to sell an apartment in London, reportedly his only asset outside Mauritius (Rawat Witness Statement, para. 43), and his wife is the owner of other properties. Rawat also alleged that Mauritius\u2019 freezing of assets of his close family deprived them of the possibility of assisting him, and he had to borrow the \u20ac 50,000 to pay the advance on costs for the Initial Phase of these proceedings from friends.\n\n42.\n\nRawat alleges that third party funders are interested in funding this case, but they cannot take a decision without access to the documents underlying the nTan Report, to perform the necessary due diligence. He does not identify interested funders or details of his discussions with them.\n\n**IV. THE APPLICABLE STANDARD FOR INTERIM MEASURES**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe applicable UNCITRAL Rule is Article 26.1, which provides (emphasis added):\n\n*At the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems **necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute,** including measures for the conservation of the goods forming the subject-matter in dispute, such as ordering their deposit with a third person or the sale of perishable goods.*\n\n44.\n\nThe Parties agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that a grant of interim measures requires exceptional circumstances.\n\n45.\n\nOne element of necessity under Article 26.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules is that the applicant must have a recognizable right to be preserved, whether substantive or procedural. More concretely, for an interim measure to be necessary, the requesting party must demonstrate that the measure is both (a) urgent, and (b) essential to prevent irreparable harm to its rights. The accepted test for urgency is whether *\"action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before* [a] *final decision is given\".*4 As for irreparable harm, it is well-established that harm claimed is not irreparable if it can be compensated by monetary damages.5\n\nFor example, *Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt (Finland* v *Denmark),* Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures, Order of 29 July 1991, (1991) *I.C. J. Reports* 12, para. 23 (Exh RLA-36).\n\nFor example, *Plama Consortium Limited* v *Republic of Bulgaria,* Order on Provisional Measures, ICSID Case No. ARB//03/24, 6 September 2005, para. 46 (Exh RLA-38).\n\n46.\n\nIn determining whether interim measures are necessary for purposes of Article 26.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules, tribunals also consider the balance of the parties\u2019 respective interests and assess whether such measures would harm either party. Further, tribunals avoid granting interim measures if to do so would involve prejudgment of the merits of the dispute.6\n\nFor example, *Transglobal Green Energy LLC and Transglobal Green Panama S.A.* v *Republic of Panama,* Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Shifting the Costs of the Arbitration, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/28, 4 March 2015, para. 43 (Exh RLA-41) *(Transglobal* v *Panama).*\n\n**V. RAWAT\u2019S REQUEST FOR INTERIM MEASURES**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn his Request for Interim Measures of 1 August 2016, Rawat requests seven separate interim measures, broken down into three categories:\n\n***i. End of the Retaliation Measures by the Republic of Mauritius against the Investor and his family***\n\n*102. The Investor respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an order to end the retaliation measures against the Investor and members of his family by enjoining the Republic of Mauritius, directly and through any entity it controls - including for the avoidance of doubt, entities and persons appointed as \"Special Administrator\", \"Receiver\", \"Conservator\" or otherwise - to stop the Retaliation Measures against the Investor and Members of his family, including for the avoidance of doubt the stay of the conditions to the bail imposed and the Objection to Departure concerning Adeela Rawat, Laina Rawat, Claudio A.S. Feistritzer and Brian Burns.*\n\n***ii. The measures to be ordered to allow the Investor Access to Justice in these proceedings***\n\n*103. The Investor respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal, either alternatively or concurrently:*\n\n*- order the Republic of Mauritius to pay, in its entirety, the advance on costs of an amount to be determined by the Tribunal or, alternatively, the advance on costs related to the jurisdictional objection announced by the Republic of Mauritius; and/or*\n\n*- order the unfreezing by the Republic of Mauritius of the bank account n\u00b03100002222MUR03 held at the Bramer Bank (now MauBank) with a balance of 14,126,650 Mauritian rupees as at 2 April 2015 (approximately USD 403,000); and/or*\n\n*- order the unfreezing by the Republic of Mauritius of the following two contiguous plots of land in Port Louis, Mauritius:*\n\n*A plot of land of the extent of 878.70m2 situated at no.35, Rue Monseigneur Gonin, Port Louis, Mauritius, acquired by Mr Dawood Rawat on 1 December 2008 by virtue of title duly transcribed in Vol 7247/26, of an approximate value at the time of the freezing order of Mauritian rupees 31,861,440 (approx. USD 909,000);*\n\n*A plot of land of the extent of 809.14m2 situated at no.34, Rue Dr. Eugene Laurent, Port Louis, Mauritius, acquired by Mr Dawood Rawat on 24 September 2009 by virtue title deed duly transcribed in Vol 7496/61, of an approximate value at the time of the freezing order of MUR 16,000,000 (approx. USD 456,000); and/or*\n\n*- order the Republic of Mauritius to provide the Claimant with all documents made available to nTan for making its report; and/or*\n\n*- order any other measure that it deems appropriate to ensure the respect of the Investor s right to access justice.*\n\n***iii. Non-aggravation of the Dispute***\n\n*104. The Investor respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an order enjoining the Republic of Mauritius to refrain from taking any measure or action that would have the effect of aggravating the dispute, including but not limited to, any further retaliatory measures and media campaign against the Investor, any member of his family and their respective property until the Tribunal has issued a final award in the instant case.*\n\n48.\n\nFor ease of reference, the Tribunal will refer to these three categories of measures as the Retaliation Measure, the Costs Advance Measures, and the Aggravation Measure.\n\n**A. Scope and Admissibility of the Rawat Request**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, Mauritius asks the Tribunal to reject as inadmissible all but one of the seven specific interim measures requested - Rawat\u2019s request to shift responsibility for the entire advance on costs to Mauritius - as outside the scope of the Initial Phase of these proceedings. The Tribunal turns first to this issue.\n\n**i. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Parties take directly opposite positions.\n\n51.\n\nThe heart of Mauritius\u2019 position is that the Tribunal, in Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 2, expressly defined the scope of the Initial Phase to be Rawat\u2019s demand that Mauritius fund the entire advance on costs, on grounds that Mauritius wrongly deprived him of his assets. All other requests for interim measures, says Mauritius, are inadmissible in this Initial Phase.\n\n52.\n\nIn reply, Rawat argues that neither Procedural Order No. 1 nor Procedural Order No. 2 expressly limits the scope of the interim measures encompassed. Further, he emphasizes that he clearly indicated prior to the Procedural Orders that he would seek interim measures beyond his request to shift responsibility for the entire advance on costs to Mauritius. In his email of 31 May 2016, quoted above at paragraph 11, he stated that his application on the advance on costs *\"will also include other requests for interim relief\".* In his Notice of Arbitration (at para. 95), he indicated that he: *\"will apply for other interim measures such as the interruption of the local media campaign and of the retaliations effected by the Republic of Mauritius and the unfreeze of its bank accounts*\".\n\n**ii. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that both Parties have valid arguments, as the language in Procedural Orders No. 1 and 2 can be read as ambiguous.\n\n54.\n\nMauritius is correct that, following the first procedural conference call on 9 June 2016, the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1 did describe the *\"immediate issue before the Tribunal\"* to be *\"the Claimant\u2019s request that the Respondent bear the full amount of the advances on costs in this arbitration\"* and did order the Parties each to deposit \u20ac 50,000 to cover *\"the Claimant\u2019s anticipated application for interim measures to shift responsibility for the full advances on costs to the Respondent, including the Respondent\u2019s anticipated defenses* \".\n\n55.\n\nRawat is correct that we also stated in Procedural Order No. 1 that our order for the shared initial advance on costs was *\"without prejudice to the final decision of the Tribunal on the requested shifting of advances and other interim relief requested...\".*\n\n56.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2 anticipates, but without restriction, that *\"in the Initial Phase of this arbitration the Claimant will submit a request for interim measures to shift responsibility for the full advances on costs to the Respondent... and the Respondent will submit an application for security for costs...\".*\n\n57.\n\nUnder the circumstances, in the interests of fairness and efficiency, we have determined to admit all seven of Rawat\u2019s specific requests for interim measures. The Parties\u2019 thorough submissions allow us to rule on all seven requests.\n\n**B.** ***Prima Facie*** **Jurisdiction of the Rawat Request**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs a second preliminary and overarching matter, Mauritius submits that Rawat has failed to establish that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to hear his claims on the merits, which he must do before the Tribunal can order interim measures in his favor. Rawat insists that he has established such *prima facie* jurisdiction.\n\n59.\n\nRawat is a French national as well as a Mauritian national. Without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate decision on Mauritius\u2019 objection to jurisdiction related to his dual nationality, the Tribunal accepts that *prima facie* Rawat is a French investor and may benefit from the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n60.\n\nFor reasons explained below, the critical issue of *prima facie* jurisdiction now before us turns on the interpretation of the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal first sets out the relevant treaty provisions and then summarizes the Parties\u2019 contrary interpretive positions.\n\n**i. The Relevant BIT Provisions**\n----------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe France-Mauritius BIT does not provide for a direct right of arbitration of a dispute between an investor and the host state under the treaty.\n\n63.\n\nArticle 9 does provide that investment contracts between an investor and the host state must include a dispute resolution clause providing for ICSID arbitration if amicable resolution cannot be reached:\n\n*Les accords relatifs aux investissements \u00e0 effectuer sur le territoire d\u2019un des Etats contractants, par les ressortissants, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou autres personnes morales de l\u2019autre Etat contractant, comporteront obligatoirement une clause pr\u00e9voyant que les diff\u00e9rends relatifs \u00e0 ces investissements devront \u00eatre soumis, au cas o\u00f9 un accord amiable ne pourrait intervenir \u00e0 bref d\u00e9lai, au Centre international pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements, en vue de leur r\u00e8glement par arbitrage conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Convention sur le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d\u2019autres Etats.*\n\nIn free translation:\n\n*Agreements relating to investments to be made in the territory of one of the Contracting States by nationals, companies or other legal persons of the other Contracting State, must include a clause providing that their disputes relating to these investments shall be submitted, in the event that an amicable agreement cannot be reached within a short period of time, to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, with a view to their settlement by arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States.*\n\n64.\n\nThe relevant MFN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT, Article 8 paragraph 2, provides (emphasis added):\n\n***Pour les mati\u00e8res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention** autres que celles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article* 7 [tax matters], *les investissements des ressortissants, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou autres personnes morales de l\u2019un des Etats contractants b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient \u00e9galement de toutes les dispositions plus favorables que celles du pr\u00e9sent Accord qui pourraient r\u00e9sulter d\u2019obligations internationales d\u00e9j\u00e0 souscrites ou qui viendraient \u00e0 \u00eatre souscrites par cet autre Etat avec le premier Etat contractant ou avec des Etats tiers.*\n\nIn free translation:\n\n***For the matters governed by7 the present Convention** other than those referred to in article* 7 *[tax matters], investments made by nationals, companies or other legal persons of one of the contracting States shall also benefit8 from all provisions more favourable than those of the present Agreement, which may result from international obligations already entered into or to be entered into by this other State with the first contracting State or third States.*\n\nRawat translated the introductory clause of Article S paragraph 2 as \"[f] or *the subject matter covered by this agreement\"* (Notice of Arbitration, para. 70). Mauritius translated the same as \"[f]or *the matters subject to the present Convention\"* (Respondent\u2019s Answer to Rawat Request, para. 37). The Tribunal considers that the English verb \"govern\" more closely captures the French verb \"r\u00e9gir\" in the original text. The difference in translation is of little import, however, because the French text of the France-Mauritius BIT is the authentic text and the one relied upon by the Tribunal.\n\nWe note that the French present tense of *\"b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient\"* denotes an existing imperative, as opposed to an obligation to do something in the future.\n\n65.\n\nThe MFN clause expressly applies to the *\"mati\u00e8res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention autres que celles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 7\"* (the matters governed by the present Convention other than those referred to in article 7). Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT refers to the obligation of the host States to include an ICSID arbitration clause in investment agreements.\n\n66.\n\nArticle 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT of 2007, executed almost 35 years after the France-Mauritius BIT, expressly includes a right for an investor to pursue arbitration directly against the host state:\n\n*1. Any dispute arising directly from an investment between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party should be settled amicably between the two parties to the dispute.*\n\n*2. If the dispute has not been settled within three months from the date on which it was raised in writing, the dispute may, at the choice of the investor, be submitted:*\n\n*(a) to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made; or*\n\n*(b) to arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),...; or*\n\n*(c) to any ad hoc arbitration tribunal which unless otherwise agreed on by the parties to the dispute, is to be established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).*\n\n67.\n\nIn 2010, Mauritius and France entered into a new bilateral investment treaty, which also includes a right for an investor to pursue arbitration directly against the host state under the ICSID Rules.9 France has not ratified the treaty, and it has not come into force.\n\n*Accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de la Republique de Maurice sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproque des investissements, sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Port-Louis le 8 mars 2010* (Exh R-14).\n\n**ii. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIt is Rawat\u2019s case that Mauritius consented to UNCITRAL arbitration of disputes arising between it and French investors in two steps:\n\n(1) in 1973, by consenting to the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT, Article 8; and\n\n(2) in 2007, by consenting to the direct arbitration provision in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT, fully aware of the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n69.\n\nRawat emphasizes that the determination of whether an MFN clause applies to dispute resolution mechanisms, on a *prima facie* or definitive basis, can only be done with reference to the particular clause. This is what the International Law Commission Study Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause sets out in its 2015 Final Report ***(ILC MFN Report):** \"the key question of ejusdem generis -what is the scope of the treatment that can be claimed - has to be determined on a case-by-case basis\"*.10\n\nFinal Report of the Study Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, Adopted by the International Law Commission at its 67th session in 2015, and submitted to the UN General Assembly, para. 147 (Exh CLA-8) *(ILC MFN Report).*\n\n70.\n\nRawat interprets the opening phrase of the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT *- \"les mati\u00e8res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention\" -* to apply to Article 9, the contractual investor-state dispute settlement provision of the France-Mauritius BIT, and to allow Rawat, as a French investor, also to benefit from -and be able to accept - the arbitration \"offer\" made by Mauritius to Finnish investors in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT and, by virtue of the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT, to French investors as well.\n\n71.\n\nRawat argues, first, that this MFN clause is drafted in very broad terms, and falls into the broad ILC MFN Report category of MFN clauses referring to *\"all treatment\"* or *\"all matters governed by the treaty\".* Article 8 expressly excludes only tax matters from the scope of the MFN clause. There is no such exclusion of Article 9 addressing dispute resolution matters and, according to Rawat, it is therefore included.\n\n72.\n\nSecond, Rawat argues that investor-state arbitration in fact is expressly a *\"matter subject to\"* (or *\"governed by\")* the France-Mauritius BIT, because Article 9 provides that investments made in the territory of one of the two states by natural or legal persons of the other state are to include ICSID arbitration clauses in investment contracts.\n\n73.\n\nThird, there is a strong line of investor-state treaty arbitration decisions recognizing that direct arbitration is essential to protect the investor\u2019s substantive rights in the treaty, and hence procedural protections fall within language such as *\"all matters governed by the treaty\".* Rawat cites the tribunal in the *Maffezini* v *Spain* case:\n\n*Notwithstanding the fact that the basic treaty containing the clause does not refer expressly to dispute settlement as covered by the most favored nation clause, the Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors....*11\n\n*Emilio Augustin Maffezini* v *Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 (Decision of the Tribunal on the objections to jurisdiction dated 25 January 2000), pp. 20-21 (Exh CLA-10) *(Maffezini v Spain).*\n\n74.\n\nRawat submits that these interpretive arguments are sufficient to meet the *prima facie* standard for an order of interim measures, recognizing that the Tribunal is not to make a final determination of jurisdiction at the interim measures stage. He relies on the recent case of *Menzies v Senegal,* first mentioned by Mauritius, in which the tribunal found that it had *prima facie* jurisdiction to decide on interim measures sought by the claimant on the basis of the MFN provision in Article II of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.12 That the *Menzies* v *Senegal* tribunal ultimately found that it lacked jurisdiction, says Rawat, does not undermine the importance of its decision on *prima facie* jurisdiction to get to that stage of the case.\n\n*\"**Menzies Middle East and Africa S.A. et Aviation Handling Services International Ltd.* v *Republic of Senegal,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/21, 6 August 2016, Procedural Order 2, 2 December 2015, paras. 111-112 (Exh RLA-39) *(Menzies* v *Senegal).*\n\n**iii. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nAs set out in its Supplementary Submission on *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction (para. 2), Mauritius argues that the relevant test for determining *prima facie* jurisdiction to grant interim measures here is *\"to consider whether the underlying BIT contains a dispute resolution clause incorporating the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate\".* The France-Mauritius BIT does not. Article 9 of the treaty envisions only contractual investor-state ICSID arbitration based on specific consent in each relevant investment agreement. The MFN clause in the treaty - however broad - cannot on its own create the necessary standing consent to direct investor-state arbitration under the treaty.\n\n76.\n\nMauritius distinguishes *Maffezini* v *Spain* and its progeny, in which claimants were allowed to import some more favorable aspect of a direct investor-state arbitration clause in another treaty by invoking the MFN clause in the relevant base treaty, on the ground that the base treaty in each and every case contained a clause expressly giving investors the right to initiate arbitration directly against the host state. The France-Mauritius BIT does not contain such a clause.\n\n77.\n\nMauritius emphasizes that the state\u2019s consent to arbitration is *\"the cornerstone of an arbitral tribunals imperium\"* (Supplemental Submission, para. 9). To emphasize the importance of consent, Mauritius cites the ICJ in the *Case Concerning Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters:*\n\n*whatever the basis of consent, the attitude of the respondent State must be \"capable of being regarded as \u2018an unequivocal indication\u2019 of the desire of that State to accept the Courts Jurisdiction in a \u2018voluntary and indisputable\u2019manner\".13*\n\n*Case Concerning mutual assistance in criminal matters (Djibouti* v *France),* Judgment, 4 June 2008, (2008) I.C.J. Reports 177, para. 62 (Exh RLA-49).\n\n78.\n\nIn investor-state arbitration, the requirement of consent is mandatory. As stated by the tribunal in *Menzies v Senegal,* the requirement *\"flows from the respect of the sovereignty of States and the principle that under international law, States\u2019 consent to arbitration is the exception and not the rule.\"14*\n\n*Menzies* v *Senegal, supra* note 12, para. 130 [translated by Respondent].\n\n79.\n\nAbsent a clause in the France-Mauritius BIT, as the base treaty, providing for a direct right of French investors to commence arbitration against Mauritius, Rawat simply cannot rely on the MFN clause in Article 8 to benefit from the direct investor-state arbitration clause in the Finland-Mauritius BIT (or in any other French BIT) to establish jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis.* The silence means that direct investor-state dispute settlement, as opposed to contractually-agreed ICSID arbitration, is not and cannot be among the *\"matters subject to the present Convention\".*\n\n80.\n\nAccordingly, Mauritius argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, even on a *prima facie* level, to grant the interim measures Rawat seeks.\n\n**iv. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision and Analysis**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe central interpretation question posed to the Tribunal is the scope of *\"les mati\u00e8res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention\"* in the MFN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT and, in specific, whether the *\"mati\u00e8re\"* in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT is \"contractual ICSID arbitration\", \"investor-state dispute settlement\" or otherwise, and whether that *\"mati\u00e8re\",* once defined, can be considered *ejusdem generis* with the *\"mati\u00e8re\"* in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT, as also to be defined, it being recalled that this provision includes a direct right to investor-state arbitration.\n\n82.\n\nIn other words, to grant the interim measures Rawat seeks in this Initial Phase, the Tribunal would have to decide whether, as a *prima facie* matter, the MFN language in Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT is capable of extending to French investors the offer of direct arbitration made by Mauritius to Finnish investors in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT and thus, by hypothetically allowing French investors to accept the offer through the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT, can be interpreted to constitute Mauritius\u2019 consent to UNCITRAL arbitration. The Tribunal focuses in its analysis on the specific terms of the treaties,15 to be interpreted pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ***(VCLT)******.***\n\nWe agree with the conclusions of the Study Group in the ILC MFN Report, *supra* note 10 at para, 215, that \"[t]he *application of MFN clauses to dispute settlement provisions in investment treaty arbitration, rather than limiting them to substantive obligations, brought a new dimension to thinking about MFN provisions and perhaps consequences that had not been foreseen by parties when they negotiated their investment agreements. Nonetheless, the matter remains one of treaty interpretation\".*\n\n83.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that many international decisions addressing *primci facie* jurisdiction are concerned with the question of whether the facts alleged by a claimant, if assumed to be true without regard to the respondent\u2019s jurisdictional defenses, would amount *prima facie* to a breach of the claimant\u2019s substantive treaty rights within the limits of the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Here, the very question before us concerns the limits of our jurisdiction, and so the *\"prima facie\"* issue arises at an earlier stage. The question is not whether Rawat\u2019s claims, if assumed true, would constitute breaches of the France-Mauritius BIT - it is apparent that they would. The question is whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction at all, via the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n84.\n\nThis has proven to be a difficult question, not answerable by categorical positions. There are many cases in which claimants bringing claims under base treaties with clauses expressly providing in some way for direct investor-state arbitration - including, for example, an 18-month \"cooling off period\" or a local remedies requirement - have obtained the benefit of better elements of arbitration from other host state BITs for example, a shorter \"cooling off period\" or waiver of a local remedies avenue16 In comparison, counsel for the Parties have been unable to point the Tribunal to any decision in which an investment tribunal tasked with interpreting a BIT without any direct investor-state arbitration clause has found jurisdiction on the basis of an MFN clause in the base treaty, thereby allowing an investor effectively to accept an arbitration offer made by the host state to investors of a third state.17\n\nFor example, *Impregilo v Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award, 21 June 2011.\n\nThe *Menzies v Senegal* tribunal found *prima facie* jurisdiction at the interim measures stage in the absence of any arbitration agreement in the base treaty including the MFN clause, the General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement, although it ultimately denied jurisdiction in its award. The Tribunal notes, however, that the *Menzies* v *Senegal* tribunal did not order interim measures that went beyond an order for non-aggravation of the dispute, something international law provides for in any event *(supra* note 12, para. 134).\n\n85.\n\nNor, however, have counsel for the Parties been able to point us to any decision interpreting a base treaty providing for contractual investor-state arbitration but not direct investor-state arbitration. This seems to be a case of first impression in investment treaty interpretation.\n\n86.\n\nAfter full consideration, and despite the high quality of the Parties\u2019 written submissions to date, including the assistance of the requested submissions on the issue of *prima facie* MFN jurisdiction, the Tribunal decides that a finding of *prima facie* jurisdiction is unnecessary to dispose of the applications, because we have determined to deny the applications on non-jurisdictional grounds.\n\n87.\n\nWe address arrangements for the next jurisdictional phase at the end of Section V.C below. The Parties will then be able to complete their jurisdictional briefings on what is a complex issue of treaty interpretation under the VCLT.\n\n**C. The Costs Advance Measures**\n---------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe heart of the Rawat Request, and the focus of most of the Parties\u2019 attention, is on Rawat\u2019s request that Mauritius pay his equal half share of the advance on costs - if not for the full proceedings, then at least for this Initial Phase and the next jurisdiction phase - either directly or indirectly by unfreezing certain of his assets or otherwise facilitating his efforts to obtain financing.\n\n89.\n\nAgain, the Parties take squarely contrary positions.\n\n**i. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nRawat takes the position that Mauritius should fund the entire advance on costs, even though he is the claimant, because it was Mauritius\u2019 misappropriation of his assets that has left him unable to contribute. In the Request for Interim Measures (para. 96), he alleges that Mauritius\u2019 conduct *\"aims at preventing* [him] *from financing the arbitration proceedings and thereby from exercising his basic right to access justice\",* thereby \"caus[ing] *harm to the arbitral process\".*\n\n91.\n\nRawat alleges that, as a consequence of the wrongful freezing of personal and professional assets in Mauritius, he *\"does not have any assets available for living with the exception of the ones located in foreign countries\"* (Rawat Request, para. 60). These include an apartment in London, which he has been obliged to sell, and real property owned by his wife. Further, *\"the freezing of members of his close family\u2019s assets prevent him from seeking financial support from them\"* and he was forced to borrow the \u20ac 50,000 for his advance on costs for this Initial Phase from friends (Rawat Request, paras. 61-62).\n\n92.\n\nRawat argues that, under the circumstances, it is imperative that the Tribunal order Mauritius to pay the advance on costs for the entire proceedings or for a next jurisdictional phase, or to facilitate his payment of such advance by unfreezing certain bank accounts and/or real properties. He commits to use such unfrozen funds only for these arbitration proceedings. As a further alternative, he seeks release of the documents underlying the nTan Report to facilitate his arranging third party financing.\n\n93.\n\nIn the words of Article 26.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Rawat argues that it is *\"necessary\"* for Mauritius to fund or assist him to fund the advance on costs, or his substantive treaty rights will go unprotected. He relies upon Q *uiborax* v *Bolivia:*\n\n*In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form the subject matter of the dispute, but may extend to procedural rights....*\n\n*The rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party\u2019s ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal....18*\n\n*Ouiborax S.A. Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplan* v *Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, paras. 117-118 (Exh CLA-5) *(Quiborax v Bolivia).*\n\n94.\n\nRawat argues that he will suffer irreparable harm if Mauritius does not fund this arbitration or at least unfreeze enough of his allegedly wrongfully frozen assets in Mauritius to allow him to pay the advance on costs himself. In the Rawat Request (paras. 10 and 30), he explains that he originally desired to seek restitution, but the *fait accompli* of Mauritius\u2019 sale and transfer of his assets has left him with no choice but to seek monetary damages. Therefore, Mauritius\u2019 argument that his monetary damages claim demonstrates that the harm alleged is *per se* reparable, by indemnity, is an *\"absolute non sense\";* it is his position that the harm he faces is precisely being barred from proceeding with the arbitration (Reply to Respondent\u2019s Answer, para. 74). Where the right to be protected is his right to access justice, the potential harm is the very impossibility of ever obtaining the damages claimed.\n\n95.\n\nLooking to the balancing of interests between the Parties, Rawat argues that his fundamental right to access justice substantially outweighs Mauritius\u2019 potential right to be able to collect costs if its defenses prove successful.\n\n**ii. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nMauritius contends that Rawat has failed to show that he is seeking the protection of a right capable of being protected by way of interim measures. Absent consent by Mauritius to arbitrate in the France-Mauritius BIT, Mauritius is not obliged to provide a corresponding legal right to access arbitral justice before an international tribunal.\n\n97.\n\nMauritius argues that Rawat\u2019s refusal to pay his share of the advance on costs is a breach of his own purported consent to arbitrate this dispute. Such consent brings with it an obligation to comply with Article 41.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which calls for equal deposits by both parties. Mauritius recognizes that Article 41.4 on its face gives UNCITRAL tribunals discretion to request either party to make the full advance should the other party refuse to pay its half share, but emphasizes that there is not one instance of a BIT tribunal requiring the respondent state - as compared to the claimant investor - to fund the entire advance on costs.\n\n98.\n\nIn the Answer to the Rawat Request (para. 8), Mauritius emphasizes the dangers posed should the Tribunal order such unprecedented relief:\n\n*Allowing a shift of the burden to bear the total advance on costs on to the Respondent, or any measure akin thereto, would in fact set a dangerous precedent in investor-state arbitration. It would in effect relieve claimants from any litigation risk, provided they could submit prima facie evidence of their impecuniosity. Claimants could even be incentivized to organize their insolvency or impecuniosity, for instance by putting their personal assets in the name of relatives, as Mr Rawat did. The end result would be that respondent states facing frivolous claims, as Mauritius in this case, would have to fund these cases on tax payers\u2019 money.*\n\n99.\n\nEven if the Costs Advance Request is a proper matter for interim relief, argues Mauritius, Rawat has failed to show that the relief requested is necessary for purposes of Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n100.\n\nFirst, Rawat cannot show irreparable harm because he is seeking relief only in the form of monetary damages. Mauritius cites the *Menzies* v *Senegal* tribunal in support of this argument:\n\n*as the Claimants requested to be compensated for their loss and did not make a request for specific performance, the Arbitral Tribunal infers therefrom that they consider their loss as reparable by the award of monetary damages.... The Arbitral Tribunal thus considers that the harm invoked by the Claimants is not irreparable.19*\n\n*Menzies v Senegal, supra* note 12, Procedural Order No. 2, paras. 120-121 [translated by Respondent].\n\n101.\n\nSecond, Rawat cannot show urgency as he has not demonstrated exhaustion of all options to finance his case. He admits, in the Rawat Request (para. 60), that he owns assets in his own or his wife\u2019s names. He has chosen not to seek extensions of time to obtain financing to pay his share of advances.\n\n102.\n\nThird, the balance of the Parties\u2019 respective interests falls on Mauritius\u2019 side, as it has the greater interest on behalf of its tax payers - in recovering its share, as well as Rawat\u2019s share, of the costs should the Tribunal accept its defenses and rule in its favor. (This argument overlaps with Mauritius\u2019 own Application for Security for Costs, discussed below.)\n\n103.\n\nFinally, the Costs Advance Request is inseparable from Rawat\u2019s case on the merits - Mauritius\u2019 alleged misappropriation of and interference with his assets - and so the Tribunal cannot grant the requested measures without prejudging the merits. Mauritius relies on the outcome of the *Transglobal Green Energy v Panama* arbitration, where the tribunal denied Panama\u2019s application to shift the arbitration costs to the claimants because of the risks posed by the claimants\u2019 financial difficulties, which were allegedly due to Panamanian actions:\n\n*As regards the financial condition of the Claimants, it is a contentious matter between the Parties whether such condition is the result of alleged measures of Respondent subject of this arbitration.... At this very early stage of the proceedings it would be premature for the Tribunal to make a determination on the financial condition of Claimants and the extent to which it may or may not be the result of Respondent\u2019s measures.20*\n\n*Transglobal* v *Panama, supra* note 6.\n\n104.\n\nMauritius resists Rawat\u2019s requests that it unfreeze the bank accounts and/or real property he designates in his Request for Relief. Even if those requests are admissible, the decisions to freeze those assets have been made by independent Mauritian courts in an ongoing criminal investigation. Furthermore, if those assets were released to Rawat to fund this arbitration, it would be to the prejudice of creditors.\n\n105.\n\nMauritius also resists Rawat\u2019s request for production of documents underlying the nTan Report. Even if the request were admissible, Rawat has not submitted any evidence that such documents would improve his position vis-\u00e0-vis third party funders.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal is whether Mauritius can and should be made responsible to fund - either directly or indirectly - the entire advance on costs for the entire proceedings, or initially for the next jurisdictional phase, in an arbitration it is defending.\n\n107.\n\nThe applicable rules are technically straightforward. Article 41.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules authorizes a tribunal to direct the parties to deposit the advance on costs in equal shares. Pursuant to Article 41.4, if one party does not pay its deposit within 30 days, *\"the arbitral tribunal shall so inform the parties in order that one or another of them may make the required payment\".*\n\n108.\n\nAs far as the Tribunal is aware, and with the assistance of the Parties\u2019 counsel, no other tribunal has ordered the respondent state to pay the investor\u2019s share of the advance on costs for a BIT arbitration. The reported decisions all concern decisions ordering the claimant - the party that commenced the arbitration - to pay the respondent state\u2019s share of the advance on costs.\n\n109.\n\nRawat acknowledges this, but differentiates his situation by presenting his Costs Advance Requests under the umbrella of the alleged right to protected access to arbitral justice. As such, Rawat\u2019s claims based on his impecuniosity skate very close to the merits of his case, which turn on whether Mauritius violated the France-Mauritius BIT by freezing and taking other actions depriving him of his assets in Mauritius. This is, to a certain degree, inherent in the process of assuming the facts as alleged by Rawat to be true (which we do), at this preliminary stage.\n\n110.\n\nHaving considered both Parties\u2019 positions on this vigorously contested issue, the Tribunal finds that it does not need to decide Mauritius\u2019 defense that the Costs Advance Requests do not engage rights capable of being protected with interim measures. This is because we find that Rawat has not proven, on a balance of the probabilities, that he meets the separate requirements of urgency and irreparable harm to his rights in this arbitration.\n\n111.\n\nIn our view, Rawat has not sufficiently demonstrated that he has exhausted the options available to finance his case, at least through the next jurisdiction phase. We are not convinced Rawat does not have short-term access to sufficient funds to pay his share of the next advance on costs to cover a focused jurisdiction phase, in which the Parties are to make additional submissions on the MFN issue, the dual nationality issue, and any other jurisdictional issues. We cannot ignore the fact that Rawat was successful in obtaining funds to pay the first deposit of \u20ac 50,000 on the advance on costs for the Initial Phase, and that he has succeeded in having his lawyers make substantial filings in the case thus far.\n\n112.\n\nWe recognize Rawat\u2019s argument that it is circular for Mauritius to argue that he admits he will suffer no irreparable harm by pursuing only monetary damages, when he allegedly is impecunious because of Mauritius\u2019 own misappropriation of his assets, and so cannot fund the arbitration necessary to attempt to recoup damages for that alleged misappropriation. But this is the situation faced by any investor claimant in a similar situation. If Mauritius were required to fund the proceedings, it would protect Rawat from all litigation risk, at the expense of the Mauritian tax payers.\n\n113.\n\nWe also find no basis for Rawat\u2019s alternative requests that Mauritius be ordered to fund his share indirectly by unfreezing the bank accounts and/or the real property identified in his Request for Relief. In any event, to order such an interim measure would risk crossing the border into the merits of the case, as unfreezing the relevant assets would in effect provide to Rawat the first instalment of the relief he seeks on the merits.\n\n114.\n\nNor can we find any basis for Rawat\u2019s request that we order Mauritius to release the documentation underlying the nTan Report to assist him in obtaining third party funding for this arbitration. Rawat has not supported this request with particulars as to the identity of allegedly interested funders, or the information they require to complete their necessary due diligence.\n\n115.\n\nIn our view, this document production request would in any event more appropriately be made at the merits phase of the arbitration, if the case reaches that phase and Mauritius has not voluntarily produced the requested nTan documents.\n\n116.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal will establish the next advance on costs for the jurisdictional phase at \u20ac 200,000, which should be sufficient to cover the full expenses of the Initial Phase and to allow the Tribunal to consider the Parties\u2019 full written submissions and, if requested, oral submissions in a short hearing. We accordingly direct the Parties to arrange for the PCA to continue to provide depository services, and to each deposit \u20ac 100,000 with the PCA within 60 days.\n\n117.\n\nOur determination is without prejudice to Rawat\u2019s resubmitting his Costs Advance Requests if he is unable to obtain funds sufficient to make his share of the requested deposit within 60 days, and is able to prove that he has exhausted reasonable funding avenues.\n\n**D. The Retaliation and Aggravation Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nRawat combines the arguments supporting his requests for interim measures of protection against Mauritius\u2019 alleged retaliation against him and his family, and against Mauritian actions aggravating the dispute. The Tribunal accordingly addresses the Retaliation and Aggravation Measures together.\n\n**i. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nIn the Request for Relief in his Request for Interim Measures (para. 102), Rawat seeks an order from the Tribunal ending all retaliation measures against him and his family members, by:\n\n*enjoining the Republic of Mauritius, directly and through any entity it controls - including for the avoidance of doubt, entities and persons appointed as \"Special Administrator\", \"Receiver\", \"Conservator\" or otherwise \u2014 to stop the Retaliation Measures against the Investor and Members of his family, including... the stay of the conditions to the bail imposed and the Objection to Departure concerning Adeela Rawat, Laina Rawat, Claudio A.S. Feistritzer and Brian Burns.*\n\n120.\n\nAs briefly described in Section III above, this alleged retaliation campaign includes the criminal charges, travel bans and orders that have frozen certain assets of his daughters and sons-in-law; the termination of his relatives\u2019 employment by BAICM Group special administrators; the civil suits brought against Rawat and other BAICM Group directors; and a media campaign against Rawat and his family. Rawat supports these allegations with witness statements and documentary evidence.21\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated 7 September 2016, counsel for Rawat objected that the paucity of factual evidence in the Mauritius Application violated paragraph 4.3 of Procedural Order No. 2, which requires Parties to identify the evidence adduced or to be adduced in the submissions in support of their cases. This requirement was not meant to apply to this Initial Phase, in which we are to assume the truth of facts alleged in relation to the Parties\u2019 interim measures applications.\n\n121.\n\nIn the Request for Relief (para. 104), Rawat also requests the Tribunal to enjoin Mauritius (emphasis in original):\n\n***to refrain from taking any measure or action that would have the effect of aggravating the dispute,** including but not limited to, any further retaliatory measures and media campaign against the Investor, any member of his family and their respective property until the Tribunal has issued a final award in the instant case.*\n\n122.\n\nRawat connects the necessity for the Retaliation and Aggravation Measures sought to his overall argument based on denial of access to arbitral justice. He submits that the Mauritian legal proceedings and negative media campaign have left him and his family impecunious, and have so compromised his reputation that he can no longer obtain external financing.\n\n123.\n\nThese Requests also overlap with his Costs Advance Request in relation to the nTan Report, He alleges that Mauritius\u2019 actions have prevented him from obtaining third party funding, in particular the public distribution of the nTan Report without release of the underlying BAICM financial documentation that Mauritius confiscated.\n\n124.\n\nTo demonstrate the necessity for the Retaliation and Aggravation Measures under Article 26.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Rawat relies on the arguments made in connection with the Costs Advance Measures as to urgency, irreparable harm, and balancing of interests. As summarized in the Request for Interim Measures (para. 55), he submits:\n\n*The suspension of the legal proceedings and retaliation measures requested by* [him] is *necessary to safeguard the fairness and the integrity of the arbitral process and to insure the non-aggravation of the dispute.*\n\n**ii. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIn reply, Mauritius argues that there are no justifiable grounds for the Tribunal to order the Retaliation and Aggravation Measures. Neither Rawat, who is outside of Mauritius, nor his relatives are under any direct or immediate threat that could justify the granting of interim measures under the necessity standard of Article 26.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n126.\n\nMauritius emphasizes that none of Rawat\u2019s relatives is being held in custody, all have been given the opportunity to be heard in court, and all have been given appropriate access to assets for living expenses. Among other things, the Laina Rawat Declaration records that she reached a settlement with the administrator for Bramer Bank, allowing her to transfer hinds in her name.\n\n127.\n\nIt is Rawat\u2019s decision, says Mauritius, not to return to Mauritius to defend himself in the investigation and court proceedings. Given that decision, there is no urgency in his request for interim measures and no showing whatsoever of irreparable harm from the status quo.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s assessment of Rawat\u2019s requests for the Retaliation and Aggravation Measures need not be lengthy. His arguments in support of these requests are derivative of those made in support of his requests for the Costs Advance Measures, which we have rejected as not meeting the necessity standard for interim measures.\n\n129.\n\nEven assuming as true all the facts Rawat alleges concerning retaliatory Mauritian criminal investigations, the freezing of his and his family\u2019s assets, the termination of his relatives\u2019 employment, and a negative media campaign, the Tribunal perceives no threat entailing a risk of irreparable harm to his or his family interests in relation to these proceedings. Should Rawat ultimately prove that Mauritius has taken retaliatory actions against him or Iris family in violation of the France-Mauritius BIT, any harm proven will be reparable via the monetary damages he claims.\n\n130.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal sees no need for any further procedural action concerning the Laina Rawat Declaration. That Declaration is now in the record and, as stated in our Procedural Direction of 22 October 2016, *\"we will give it \u2014 like all the evidence in the record \u2014 appropriate weight in our future analysis and decisions\".*\n\n131.\n\nNor does the Tribunal see any need for any further procedural action concerning the former residence and Villa La Preneuse that Rawat inquired about through these proceedings. Mauritius has reported that those two properties were not and are not on the relevant list of Court-ordered frozen properties, although Rawat may have made them subject to creditor claims.\n\n132.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal recalls the general legal principle requiring each party to a dispute to avoid any action that might prejudice the rights of the other party in respect of the fulfilment of any future tribunal decision on the merits, and to avoid any action of any kind, including media statements, that might aggravate or extend the dispute.22 This principle applies to the parties at all stages of arbitration, independently of the criteria for ordering other interim measures. Without prejudice to the public to be informed fairly and accurately of developments, the Tribunal expects both Parties to abide by this principle.\n\nFor example, Q *uiborax* v *Bolivia, supra* note 18, paras. 132-138; *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium* v *Bulgaria),* Order of 5 December 1939, PCIJ series A/B, No. 79, p. 199; *Amco Asia* v *Indonesia,* Decision on Request for Provisional Measures of 9 December 1983, ICSID Reports, 1993, p. 192; *Pictor* *Pey Casado & Fundaci\u00f3n Presidente Allende v Chile,* Decision on Provisional Measures, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, 25 September 2001, para. 67 (Exh RLA-5).\n\n**VI. MAURITIUS\u2019APPLICATION FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nIn its Application for Security for Costs, in the amount of \u20ac 3 million, Mauritius makes the following Prayers for Relief:\n\na) *to order the Claimant to provide security for the Respondents*\n\n*costs of these proceedings in the amount of EUR 3 million, as the case may be in stages:*\n\n*- In the form and terms indicated in Annex 1 of this Application for Security [Model Bank Guarantee];*\n\n*- Alternatively, in the form and terms indicated in Annex 2 of the Application for Security [Model Escrow Agreement]; or*\n\n*- Alternatively, in any other form and terms deemed appropriate by the Tribunal;*\n\n*b) In any event, to declare that the present proceedings will be immediately terminated with prejudice, in case of non-compliance by the Claimant;*\n\n*c) to order the Claimant to pay the Respondent's costs of this Application.*\n\n134.\n\nIn many respects, the Parties\u2019 arguments on the Mauritius Application duplicate their arguments on the Rawat Request. The discussion below can therefore be relatively succinct.\n\n135.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Parties agree that, like any interim measure, an order for security for costs is warranted only if Mauritius can show that security for costs is necessary, urgent, required to prevent irreparable harm and required by exceptional circumstances.\n\n136.\n\nMauritius further submits that, as compared to the Rawat Request, the Tribunal need not have jurisdiction to order security for costs, because it is well established that respondent states are not required to demonstrate or agree to the tribunal\u2019s *prima facie* jurisdiction to obtain security for costs. Mauritius cites the assenting opinion of Dr Gavan Griffith QC in the security for costs decision in *RSM v St Lucia* in support.23\n\n*RSM Production Corporation* v. *Saint Lucia,* Decision on Saint Lucia\u2019s Request for Security for Costs, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, 13 August 2014, Assenting Opinion of Dr Gavan Griffith QC, paras. 4-6 (Exh RLA-8).\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nAs set out at the opening of the Mauritius Application (para. 2), Mauritius bases its Application on Rawat\u2019s *\"acknowledgement that he will not be able to, and thus will not, pay his share of the costs deposit to be ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal for the conduct of the proceedings pursuant to Article 41.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules\".* Mauritius submits that this is a breach of Rawat\u2019s purported consent to arbitrate, which justifies termination of the proceedings under Articles 34.2 and 41.4 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Mauritius maintains its request that the Tribunal terminate these proceedings immediately if Rawat fails to pay any advance on costs ordered by the Tribunal.\n\n138.\n\nMauritius argues that Rawat\u2019s admission that he cannot pay any further advance on costs *a fortiori* amounts to an exceptional admission that he will not satisfy any adverse costs award. This suffices, says Mauritius, to satisfy the necessity test for an order for security for costs, because, without such early protection, there is every possibility that Mauritius will suffer the irreparable harm of never being able to recover the costs expended to defend itself. Mauritius again relies on the example of the *RSM* v *St Lucia* tribunal awarding security for costs in favor of St Lucia.\n\n139.\n\nMauritius also contends that it has established an arguable defence to Rawat\u2019s claim, in particular on jurisdiction, and the general principle of costs following the award ensures the possibility that Mauritius will be awarded costs. Therefore, argues Mauritius, the Tribunal need not prejudge the outcome on jurisdiction or the merits to protect Mauritius here with security for costs.\n\n**B. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nRawat does not dispute that he does not have the financial capacity to fund this arbitration, as evidenced by the fact that he had to borrow funds from friends to pay his initial \u20ac 50,000 share on the advance on costs. He also does not dispute that he has been unable to secure external financing.\n\n141.\n\nRawat relies, however, on the proposition that mere financial difficulties of a party do not constitute the necessarily exceptional circumstances that would justify an order of security for costs against him. Rawat also cites the *RSM v St Lucia* case, which is the sole case in which an investment treaty tribunal has ordered security for costs against a claimant.\n\n142.\n\nRawat argues that Mauritius has not demonstrated a risk that it will suffer irreparable harm. This is because, by seizing and freezing all of his personal and professional assets, Mauritius has effectively created for itself a *de facto* security for costs. Mauritius is now in the position of being able to sell his assets and thereby recover any costs.\n\n143.\n\nIn light of Mauritius\u2019 self-redress for costs, Rawat argues in his Answer to the Mauritius Application (para. 44) that an order for security for costs against him would be would be a *\"triple penalty\".* He would not only be denied his assets, but also prevented from accessing his assets to finance the arbitration and obliged to find more funds to finance a security for costs order.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal is not prepared to order security for costs in Mauritius\u2019 favor against Rawat at this juncture. As far as we are aware, the *RSM* v *St Lucia* tribunal stands alone in ordering security for costs against a claimant in an investment treaty arbitration. The tribunal reached its decision on the basis of a panoply of exceptional circumstances, including first and foremost the claimant\u2019s proven history of failing to comply with costs orders and awards, and, incidentally, uncertainties posed by the claimant\u2019s unidentified third party funder.\n\n145.\n\nWe do not find that Rawat\u2019s impecuniosity is sufficient to create the exceptional circumstances necessary to order security for costs. Our determination is not based on Rawat\u2019s allegations that Mauritius has access to funds belonging to him to satisfy any ultimate costs order against him. Our determination is without prejudice to Mauritius resubmitting this application should future developments so warrant.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal also denies Mauritius\u2019 prayer for a declaration that the proceedings are to be immediately terminated if Rawat fails to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s decision that it deposit one-half of the advance on costs for the jurisdictional phase. Again, this decision is without prejudice to Mauritius resubmitting this application should future developments so warrant.\n\n**VII. ORDER**\n--------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal orders as follows:\n\n(1) The Respondent\u2019s request to deny as inadmissible all of the Claimant\u2019s specific requests for interim measures except the request for shifting to Mauritius the responsibility to fund the entire advance on costs, as falling outside of the scope of this Initial Phase as determined in Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 2, is denied.\n\n(2) The Claimant\u2019s Request for Interim Measures, including all of the specific requests for interim measures, is denied, with leave to re-apply.\n\n(3) The Respondent\u2019s Application for Security for Costs is denied, with leave to re-apply\n\n(4) The Tribunal sets the advance for costs for the next jurisdiction phase at \u20ac 200,000. The Parties are to liaise with the Permanent Court of Arbitration ***(PCA) to*** continue its depository services for the jurisdiction phase. Subject to Rawat\u2019s leave to re-apply, each Party is to deposit its half-share of \u20ac 100,000 for the jurisdiction phase with the PCA within 60 days of the date of this Order.\n\n(5) Upon confirmation from the PCA that the entire advance on costs for the jurisdiction phase has been deposited, the Tribunal will schedule a further procedural conference call to establish the procedural timetable for the jurisdiction phase.\n\n(6) The allocation of costs in relation to this Initial Phase is reserved.\n\n(7) All other requests for relief are denied."}, {"Title": "Award on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2018-04-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award on Jurisdiction\n---------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Mr Dawood Ajum Rawat ***(Rawat),*** is pursuing this arbitration against the Respondent, the Republic of Mauritius (***Mauritius),*** to claim for alleged breaches of the Investment Promotion Treaty entered into on 22 March 1973 between the Republic of France and Mauritius ***(France-Mauritius BIT).1*** Rawat brings this arbitration under the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules through the Most Favored Nation ***(MFN)*** clause in the France-Mauritius BIT and the arbitration clause in the 2007 Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the Promotion and Protection of Investments ***(Finland-Mauritius BIT).2***\n\n*Convention entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de I'lle Maurice sur la protection des investissements, sign\u00e9e \u00e1 Port-Louis le 22 mars 1973 **(France-Mauritius BIT)*** (Exh C-l). The authentic language of the France-Mauritius BIT is French.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 12 September 2007 (Exh C-2).\n\n2.\n\nIn brief, Rawat alleges that Mauritius violated the France-Mauritius BIT by freezing and misappropriating his protected investment in the group of companies known as British American Investment Co. (Mauritius) ***(BAICM),*** which includes the Bramer Banking Corporation Ltd (***Bramer Bank).*** He seeks compensation for these alleged treaty breaches in an amount exceeding US$ 1 billion. Mauritius does not dispute that certain of the actions alleged by Rawat have occurred, but denies any violation of its obligations under the France-Mauritius BIT. According to Mauritius, the freeze of Rawat\u2019s personal and business assets and related actions are part of an ongoing, and legal, investigation of alleged Ponzi-like schemes orchestrated by him and/or his family members, involving money laundering and fraud at the level of MUR 1 billion.\n\n3.\n\nMauritius has raised preliminary objections based on the alleged lack of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis and ratione personae,* and requests the Tribunal to dismiss Rawat\u2019s claims. In response, Rawat requests the Tribunal to dismiss the jurisdictional objections and proceed to decide the merits of his claims.\n\n4.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal determines that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* to hear the claims made.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 June 2015, the Claimant sent a Notice of Dispute to the Respondent, through his legal representatives Dr Andrea Pinna and Professor Xavier Boucobza. By letter dated 11 September 2015, through its appointed legal representatives Lalive SA, Mauritius informed Rawat that it found no basis in the France-Mauritius BIT for his claims.\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 November 2015, Rawat sent and Mauritius received the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim. Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and as confirmed in paragraph 2.6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Terms of Appointment executed on 2 September 2016, these proceedings are deemed to have commenced on 9 November 2015.\n\n7.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, Rawat notified Mauritius of his appointment of Mr Jean-Christophe Honlet as the first arbitrator. By letter dated 9 December 2015, Mauritius notified Rawat of its appointment of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC as the second arbitrator. By Rawat\u2019s letter dated 6 May 2016 and Mauritius\u2019 letter dated 15 May 2016, the Parties appointed Professor Lucy Reed as Presiding Arbitrator. In paragraph 4(4) of the Terms of Appointment, the Parties confirmed that the members of the Tribunal have been validly appointed in accordance with the France-Mauritius BIT, the Finland-Mauritius BIT and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n8.\n\nBy email dated 31 May 2016, counsel for Mauritius sent to the Tribunal drafts of the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1, prepared jointly by the Parties. The drafts highlighted remaining differences between the Parties, notably the place of arbitration, the language of arbitration, and the responsibility to pay the advance on costs for the arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nBy email also dated 31 May 2016, Rawat indicated his intention to request that Mauritius bear the entire advance on costs. In turn, by letter dated 31 May 2016, Mauritius indicated its intention to seek termination of the case should Rawat refuse to contribute his equal share of the advance on costs, as envisioned in Article 41(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n10.\n\nAfter a further exchange of correspondence, the Tribunal conducted a conference call with counsel for the Parties on 9 June 2016 to address procedures for the opening phase of the arbitration. In Procedural Order No. 1 issued on 15 June 2016, the Tribunal ordered the Parties jointly to request the Permanent Court of Arbitration **(PC4),** or such other institution as they might agree, to administer this arbitration, and to deposit the initial advance on costs of \u20ac 100,000 in equal shares with the PCA or substitute institution by 13 July 2016.\n\n11.\n\nBy email dated 17 June 2016, in response to inquiries from the Parties, the Tribunal clarified that the role for the PCA or other administering institution was most importantly to collect and manage the deposits toward the advance on costs, as the Tribunal members were not in a position to open and manage an escrow account.\n\n12.\n\nThe Parties proceeded to arrange depository services with the PCA. By email dated 14 July 2016, the PCA acknowledged receipt of Mauritius\u2019 and Rawat\u2019s initial deposits of\u20ac 50,000 each on 30 June and 12 July 2016, respectively.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on 12 August 2016. This Order established Brussels as the place of arbitration and English as the language of arbitration, and annexed the procedural calendar for the Initial Phase of the arbitration. The Initial Phase was described to include Rawat\u2019s anticipated *\"request for interim measures to shift responsibility for the full advances on costs to Mauritius\"* and Mauritius\u2019 anticipated *\"application for security for costs in relation\"'* to Rawat\u2019s interim measures request.\n\n14.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, Rawat submitted his Request for Interim Measures. He asked the Tribunal to order Mauritius to fund the entire advance on costs, either directly or by unfreezing certain of his bank accounts and real property and/or releasing certain documents to potential third-party funders; to enjoin Mauritius from continuing alleged retaliation measures against his family; and to enjoin Mauritius from taking action aggravating the dispute, such as media campaigns and retaliatory measures. The Request included 10 witness declarations, including the Witness Statement of Rawat dated 29 July 2016, 65 documentary exhibits, and six legal authorities. On 5 and 7 September 2016, Rawat submitted six additional documentary exhibits.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 September 2016, Mauritius submitted its Application for Security for Costs in the amount of \u20ac 3 million. The Application included four documentary exhibits and 20 legal authorities.\n\n16.\n\nOn 26 September 2016, Mauritius submitted its Answer to Rawat\u2019s Request for Interim Measures, with 22 legal authorities. On the same date, Rawat submitted his Answer to Mauritius\u2019 Application for Security for Costs, with five documentary exhibits and one legal authority.\n\n17.\n\nOn 10 October 2016, Mauritius submitted its Reply to Claimant\u2019s Answer to the Application for Security for Costs, with three witness statements, three additional documentary exhibits, and four additional legal authorities. On the same date, Rawat submitted his Reply to Respondent\u2019s Answer to the Request for Interim Measures, with three additional documentary exhibits and one additional legal authority.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 14 October 2016, Rawat asked the Tribunal to direct Mauritius to indicate whether two of his properties, described as his \"*former residence in Mauritius and the villa at La Preneuse\"* were subject to freezing orders in Mauritius.\n\n19.\n\nOn 16 October 2016, with leave of the Tribunal, Mauritius submitted six new exhibits related to Mauritian court proceedings involving, among others, one of Rawat\u2019s daughters, Ms Laina Rawat. By letter dated 17 October 2016, Rawat asked to submit a short declaration of Ms Rawat explaining her motivation in discontinuing her request for appointment of a new receiver to represent Bramer Bank in the Mauritian court proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nAs envisioned in Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal conducted a procedural conference call on 17 October 2016 \"to *consider hearing requests and next steps for the Initial Phase\".* As neither Party had requested a hearing, the Tribunal confirmed that it would decide Rawat\u2019s Request for Interim Measures and Mauritius\u2019 Application for Security for Costs on the written submissions. During the conference call, counsel addressed Rawat\u2019s requests in his letters of 14 and 17 October 2016 and, at the request of the Tribunal, the question of *prima facie* jurisdiction for the Initial Phase in relation to the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on 18 October 2016. The Tribunal authorized Rawat to submit a short declaration by Ms Rawat regarding the relevant Mauritian court proceedings by 19 October 2016, and ordered the Parties to consult on the status of the residence and villa referenced in Rawat\u2019s 14 October letter, in particular whether the properties were subject to a freezing order or not, and to report on the same by 25 October 2016. The Tribunal also ordered the Parties to file any further legal submissions on the issue of *prima facie* jurisdiction in relation to the MFN Clause of the France-Mauritius BIT by 25 October 2016.\n\n22.\n\nOn 18 October 2016, Rawat submitted Ms Rawat\u2019s Declaration dated 17 October 2016, which annexed three documents from the Mauritian Supreme Court case of *Laina Dawood Rawat v Financial Intelligence Unit* (Serial No. 914/2016). By letter dated 20 October 2016, Mauritius requested the Tribunal to exclude Ms Rawat\u2019s Declaration from the record as being outside the scope of Procedural Order No. 3 or, in the alternative, to afford the Declaration no weight. On 21 October 2016, Rawat objected to Mauritius\u2019 request. By Procedural Direction dated 22 October 2016, the Tribunal *\"determined not to strike the Declaration, with the assurance that we will give it\u2014like all the evidence in the record\u2014appropriate weight in our future analysis and decisions\",* and directed Mauritius to submit any reply to Ms Rawat\u2019s Declaration by 28 October 2016. In its reply on 28 October 2016, Mauritius challenged the accuracy and relevance of the Declaration, and underscored that Ms Rawat has been receiving MUR 100,000 monthly pursuant to a September 2015 court order.\n\n23.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Rawat filed its Submission on the Issue of *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction in Relation to the Most Favoured Nation Provision of the France-Mauritius BIT, with three documentary exhibits and five legal authorities. Also on 25 October 2016, Mauritius filed its Supplementary Submission on *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction, with two documentary exhibits and 16 legal authorities. By letter dated 2 November 2016, Rawat commented on Mauritius\u2019 discussion in its Supplementary Submission of the 2010 Bilateral Investment Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the Protection of Investments (***2010 France-Mauritius BIT),*** which is signed but has not yet entered into force.\n\n24.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, Mauritius informed the Tribunal that the two properties Rawat had inquired about\u2014his former residence and the villa at La Preneuse\u2014are not on the list of his frozen properties but are subject to charges granted by him to creditors.\n\n25.\n\nOn 11 January 2017, the Tribunal issued its reasoned Order Regarding Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s Requests for Interim Measures. The Tribunal denied Rawat\u2019s Request for Interim Measures, with leave to re-apply, and denied Mauritius\u2019 Application for Security for Costs, also with leave to re-apply. The Tribunal reserved the issue of allocation of costs in relation to the Initial Phase.\n\n26.\n\nIn the 11 January 2017 Order, the Tribunal set the advance on costs for the next jurisdiction phase at \u20ac 200,000 and directed each Party to deposit its half-share of \u20ac 100,000 with the PCA within 60 days. On 22 February and 6 March 2017, the PCA informed the Tribunal and the Parties of its receipt of the Parties\u2019 deposits.\n\n27.\n\nOn 11 March 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to consult and attempt to agree an efficient timetable for written submissions and a hearing for the jurisdiction phase. By email dated 18 March 2017, Rawat reported to the Tribunal that the Parties were unable to agree on a timetable.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal conducted a further procedural conference call on 29 March 2017. Following the conference call, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 and a Procedural Directive dated 12 April 2017 governing the jurisdiction phase. The Tribunal ordered Mauritius to file its Memorial on Jurisdiction by 31 July 2017 and Rawat to file his Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction by 22 November 2017, and set the cut-off date for additional documentary evidence and legal authorities at 18 December 2017. The Tribunal scheduled the jurisdiction hearing for 16 and 17 January 2018, reserving a decision on the hearing venue for a later date.\n\n29.\n\nOn 6 April 2017, Mauritius informed the Tribunal that the Parties had conferred but were unable to agree on the hearing venue. Mauritius stated its preference for Brussels, the designated place of the arbitration. The Tribunal, by email dated 19 April 2017, suggested The Hague, considering that the PCA\u2019s administrative role provided free use of hearing facilities at the Peace Palace, and requested the Parties\u2019 views. Mauritius agreed to The Hague.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 25 April 2017, Rawat relayed his concern about the hearing being held in Brussels, The Hague or any other place outside France. He requested Paris as the hearing venue on grounds that he and his family members were subject to criminal proceedings in Mauritius, and attached a copy of a Mauritian \"Warrant to Apprehend\" dated 20 April 2015. Rawat argued that any travel outside France without a written undertaking from Mauritius to protect his attendance at the hearing would *\"put his security at risk;\".*\n\n31.\n\nIn the same letter of 25 April 2017, Rawat requested the Tribunal to take *\"all required measures to preserve all evidence regarding the sale of BAICM\u2019s assets pending the decision on the merits of the case\",* in the context of the appointment by the Mauritius Council of Ministers in April 2017 of a Committee of Inquiry to review the sale of Britam Kenya shares, which were indirectly owned by BAICM at the relevant time. In particular, he requested that the Tribunal order:\n\n*(i) that Respondent communicate to the Claimant information and documents regarding the sale of Claimant\u2019s assets obtained and issued by the Committee of Inquiry as they become available, or alternatively (ii) any other measure granting the preservation of evidence, notably by ordering Respondent to provide to the Tribunal and the Claimant\u2019s counsel a copy of all documents obtained and issued by the Committee of Inquiry.*\n\n32.\n\nMauritius responded by letter on 9 May 2017. Mauritius objected to the jurisdiction hearing being held in Paris, proposing that Rawat instead attend in The Hague or Brussels via video-link. With regard to Rawat\u2019s request for measures to preserve evidence, Mauritius submitted that Rawat had not shown any circumstances giving rise to a legitimate concern that Mauritius would imminently destroy, or had any intention to destroy, any documents relevant to the arbitration or documents relevant to the sale of the Britam Kenya shares or any former BAICM assets. Mauritius argued that, to the contrary, the establishment of the Committee of Inquiry to investigate the Britam Kenya share sale suggested the opposite intention.\n\n33.\n\nBy Procedural Directive on 16 May 2017, the Tribunal denied Rawat\u2019s informal request (by letter of 25 April 2017) to order measures to preserve evidence, without prejudice to his pursuing a formal application for provisional measures should the need arise.\n\n34.\n\nIn the Procedural Directive of 16 May 2017, the Tribunal also requested Mauritius to confirm or deny the validity of the 20 April 2015 Warrant to Apprehend provided by Rawat and, if valid, whether it might subject him to a risk of extradition in connection with the alleged events underpinning this arbitration if the hearing were held outside France. Subject to Mauritius\u2019 response, the Tribunal asked Rawat to explain the legal basis for the alleged risk that he could be arrested and extradited to Mauritius.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2017, Mauritius confirmed that Rawat was subject to a valid Warrant to Apprehend and a related Interpol Red Notice. Mauritius further stated that it could not provide any undertaking that the Warrant would not be executed, because the matter lay within the control of Interpol and local law enforcement authorities in the relevant state.\n\n36.\n\nOn the same day, 22 May 2017, Rawat addressed the Tribunal\u2019s question regarding the risk of arrest and extradition. He submitted that Belgium and Switzerland both have extradition treaties with Mauritius, and that the domestic Dutch Extradition Act provides a possibility of extradition under the United Kingdom-Netherlands extradition treaty, which could be extended to Mauritius as a member of the Commonwealth.\n\n37.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 5 dated 25 May 2017, the Tribunal established Paris as the venue for the jurisdiction hearing. By Procedural Directive dated 17 October 2017, following an exchange concerning the specific location in Paris for the hearing, the Tribunal selected Multiburo Op\u00e9ra as the location and requested the Parties to make the necessary logistical arrangements.\n\n38.\n\nMauritius filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 31 July 2017, together with 37 documentary exhibits and 54 legal authorities. Rawat filed his Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 22 November 2017, together with three documentary exhibits and 65 legal authorities.\n\n39.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Mauritius reported to the Tribunal the Parties\u2019 agreement to a one-day hearing on 16 January 2018, with 17 January being held in reserve. Under the circumstances, and with the Parties\u2019 concurrence, the Tribunal cancelled the prehearing procedural conference call scheduled for 12 December 2017.\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, the Tribunal sent to the Parties the following list of issues on which it would welcome elaboration or clarification during the jurisdiction hearing:\n\n*1. Whether the order in which the Tribunal assesses the two jurisdictional objections regarding nationality and MFN objections has significance and, if so, why;*\n\n*2. The relationship between the ICSID Convention and bilateral investment treaties in general insofar as each apparently sets out limits on jurisdiction and/or admissibility; and, more particularly, the meaning of the term \"ressortissants \" in Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and in Article 1(2) of the France-Mauritius treaty, and the question of the relationship of the meaning(s) of that term in those contexts, with focus on potential development of the parties\u2019 positions on the arguments in paragraphs 70-72 of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial;*\n\n*3. Clarification, if possible, of the parties\u2019 positions on the interpretation question posed in paragraph 81 of the Tribunal\u2019s Order Regarding Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s Requests for Interim Measures \u2014 what is the \"matiere\" of Article 9 of the France-Mauritius treaty and the \"matiere \" of Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius treaty and, in both cases, why?*\n\nFor convenience, paragraph 81 reads in full:\n\n*The central interpretation question posed to the Tribunal* [in the context of the request for interim measures] *is the scope of \"les mati\u00e9res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention \" in the MFN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT and, in specific, whether the \"matiere\" in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT is \"contractual ICSID arbitration\", \"investor-state dispute settlement\" or otherwise, and whether that \"matiere\", once defined, can be considered ejusdem generis with the \"matiere \" in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT, as also to be defined, it being recalled that this provision includes a direct right to investor-state arbitration.*\n\n*4. Whether effet utile is among the principles of treaty interpretation to be applied by the Tribunal and, if so, what is the result of its application to the France-Mauritius treaty?*\n\n41.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the cut-off date for submission of further documentary exhibits and/or legal authorities set in Procedural Order No. 4, Rawat submitted one additional exhibit and Mauritius submitted nine additional legal authorities.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal conducted the hearing on jurisdiction on 16 January 2018, with the reserve date of 17 January not proving necessary. For the Claimant, the attendees were Mr Dawood Rawat himself, his wife Mrs Ayesha Motala Rawat, and the counsel team of Professor Xavier Boucobza and Dr Andrea Pinna, Ms Hortense Fouchard and Ms Gabriela Mihaescu of De Gaulle Fleurance et Associ\u00e9s. For the Respondent, the attendees were Mr Rajesh Ramloll SC, Deputy Solicitor-General of the Republic of Mauritius, and the legal team of Dr Veijo Heiskanen, Ms Domitille Baizeau, Ms Laura Halonen and Ms El\u00e9onore Caroit of Lalive SA.\n\n43.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, counsel for the Parties made submissions on the jurisdiction issues in two rounds and in response to Tribunal questions. At the close of the hearing, counsel confirmed that neither Party had any complaint or objection on the procedure or the process, or on the neutrality and independence of the Tribunal.3\n\nTranscript of 16 January 2018 with consolidated corrections ***(Transcript),*** p 191, lines 24-25, Dr Pinna; p 192, lines 2-3, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n44.\n\nOn 5 March 2018, the Tribunal requested statements of costs from each Party by 19 March 2018, *\"including both their arbitration costs and their legal fees and expenses through the jurisdictional objection phase\".* The Parties filed their respective statements on 19 March 2018. The PCA provided an accounting of arbitration costs on 27 March 2018.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below a factual summary, not in full but as necessary to place the jurisdictional objections in context. These facts are as alleged by the Claimant, except where indicated otherwise.\n\n**A. Rawat\u2019s Personal History**\n-------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIt is not disputed that Rawat is a national of Mauritius.4 Rawat was bom in 1944 in Port Louis, Mauritius.5 He holds a Mauritian driving license and several directorships of Mauritian companies, and is registered as a voter in Mauritius.6 While he was residing in Rose Hill, Mauritius, he married a French national, Ayesha Motala, on 11 September 1969, and they have three daughters, all bom in Mauritius and married to Mauritian nationals.7\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 68; copy of Rawat\u2019s Mauritian National Identity Card dated 17 November 1989 (Exh R-25); Claimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 1.\n\nCertified Extract of a Birth Entry of Dawood Ajum Rawat dated 23 August 1944 (Exh R-29).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner of Police of Port Louis, Mauritius, Attestation certifying driving licence dated 2 June 2017 (Exh R-36); Mauritian Registrar of Companies, List of companies in which Rawat is involved dated 6 June 2017 (Exh R-48); letter from the Electoral Commissioner to the Solicitor General dated 23 June 2017 (Exh R-32).\n\nCertified Extract of a Marriage Entry between Dawood Ajum Rawat and Ayesha Hassam Motala dated 11 September 1969 (Exh R-31); certified Extract of a Birth Entry of Kerima Dawood Rawat dated 23 July 1971 (Exh R-37); certified Extract of a Birth Entry of Adeela Dawood Rawat dated 16 December 1977 (Exh R-38); certified Extract of a Birth Entry of Laina Dawood Rawat dated 6 March 1981 (Exh R-39).\n\n47.\n\nIn addition to being a prominent businessman, Rawat has been a philanthropist and political advisor in Mauritius. He served as the President of the Mauritian Employers\u2019 Federation and a member of the Commission of the Prerogative of Mercy, advising the President of Mauritius in relation to the President\u2019s extraordinary right to grant pardon, respite, remit or substitute punishments to persons convicted of offences.8 Rawat also made a donation to a local college in Mauritius in 2009, naming the college after his grandfather.9\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 96; L'express.mu, *\"L'homme derriere I'empire: B(h)ai Dawood, le self-made man\"* dated 2 April 2015 (Exh R-50); L'express.mu, *\"Affaire BAI: qui est Dawood Rawat?\"* dated 5 April 2015 (Exh R-49).\n\nMinistry of education & human resources, \"History of GMD Atchia State College\" (Exh R-44).\n\n48.\n\nOn 22 December 1998, Rawat submitted a Declaration of French Nationality under Article 21-2 of the French Civil Code,10 which was registered by the French authorities on 4 October 1999. According to Rawat, as the French authorities did not oppose his Declaration within one year from the date of registration, he acquired French citizenship as of 22 December 1998 by operation of Article 21-4 of the French Civil Code.11\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, p 5, and para 21; *Declaration de Nationalit\u00e9 francaise de Monsieur Dawood Rawat* (Exh C-53).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 25, in 12; *Acquisition de la nationalit\u00e9 francaise a raison du mariage,* French Civil Code in force on 2 December 1998, French Civil Code, First Book, Title I bis \"The French Nationality\", Article 21-4 (Exh CLA-18).\n\n49.\n\nRawat holds a French identity card issued on 17 June 2011, and a French passport issued on 13 February 2015.12\n\nCopy of Rawat\u2019s French identity card issued on 17 June 2011 and valid until 16 June 2021 (Exh C-95); copy of Rawat\u2019s French passport issued on 13 February 2015 and valid until 12 February 2025 (Exh C-94).\n\n50.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, Rawat was made a knight of the French *Legion d\u2019Honneur* in recognition of his *\"distinguished contribution to the economic and social life of Mauritius, as the president of an important group of companies and as a French and Mauritian citizen\".*13 The French embassy in Mauritius thanked Rawat for the contribution of his company to the organization of the French national day of 14 July in Mauritius and for his contribution to the training center of the Institut Francais de Maurice.\n\nLetter from the French embassy in Mauritius to Dawood Rawat dated 22 July 2014 (Exh C-96).\n\n**B. BAICM and Bramer Bank History**\n------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Rawat, as an employee of British American Insurance (Mauritius branch) ***(BAI),*** acquired a 20% share as part of his compensation package.14 He went on in 1990 to acquire a 70% shareholding in British American Insurance Company ***(BAIC),*** the then parent company of BAI.15 In 1992, he purchased a further 30% share of BAI through an Initial Public Offering. According to the Respondent, in addition to the BAICM group, Rawat owned shares in and participated in numerous other Mauritian businesses.16\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim ***(Statement of Claim),*** para 10.\n\nStatement of Claim, para 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 95, fn 133; Registrar of Companies, list of companies in which Rawat is involved dated 6 June 2017 (Exh R-48).\n\n52.\n\nIn 1993, Rawat settled a trust called Carmina Trust, of which he is the beneficiary, and Klad Investment Corporation ***(Klad),*** wholly owned by Rawat\u2019s Carmina Trust, was incorporated in the Bahamas in 1994.17\n\nStatement of Claim, para 14.\n\n53.\n\nIn 2003, BAI was re-structured into BAICM, a new public holding company.18 In 2006, BAIC sold its Kenya and Malta companies and BAICM became the parent company of BAIC.19 BAICM acquired South East Asia Bank in 2008, which was renamed Bramer Banking Corporation Ltd. Bramer Bank provided retail, private, corporate and international banking services.20 The Bank of Mauritius issued a banking license to Bramer Bank on 27 August 2008, and Bramer Bank commenced operations.21\n\nStatement of Claim, para 12.\n\nStatement of Claim, para 13\n\nStatement of Claim, para 36.\n\nStatement of Claim, para 36.\n\n54.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2015, BAICM was composed of more than 50 companies operating in the economic sectors of financial services, transportation, construction and property development, tourism and leisure, healthcare, and information and communication technology.22\n\nStatement of Claim, para 29.\n\n55.\n\nIn 2010, BAICM was delisted and held in a corporate chain. Carmina Trust wholly owned Klad, Klad owned 85.15% of subsidiary Seaton Investment Ltd (incorporated in Mauritius), and Seaton controlled the delisted and privately held BAICM.23 Thereafter, with approval of the Bank of Mauritius, Bramer Bank acquired debt from and amalgamated with other related companies.24\n\nStatement of Claim, para 14; Simplified Organogram of the Group at 31 March 2015 (Exh C-8); 2010 Takeover by Seaton Investment Ltd of the Minority Shareholdings in BAI (Exh C-97).\n\nLetter from Bramer Bank dated 16 March 2015, p 2 (Exh C-62); Report on the examination by nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd, Consultant appointed by the Bank of Mauritius, dated 27 January 2016, paras 2, 10 and 158168 and 168(3) ***(nTan Report)*** (Exh C-34).\n\n**C. Developments Post-November 2014**\n--------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAccording to Rawat, Mauritius took a series of actions in violation of its obligations under the France-Mauritius BIT to protect his US$ 1 billion investments, starting from 15 December 2014 with the withdrawal by the State Insurance Company of Mauritius of MUR 30 million from Bramer Bank and continuing through 2015. The alleged violations include: a campaign of premature encashment by Government of Mauritius officials and Government-related entities of funds from their Bramer Bank accounts; revocation of Bramer Bank\u2019s Banking License; appointment of receivers for Bramer Bank and transfer of Bramer Bank assets to a company wholly-owned by Mauritius for a value far below their market value; appointment of conservators for BAICM affiliates; improper enactment of the Mauritius Insurance (Amendment) Act 2015 with retroactive effect applying to BAI; appointment of special administrators for BAI and all BAICM companies; and disposal of assets of BAICM companies to the benefit of Mauritius or third parties.\n\n57.\n\nIn May 2015, the Bank of Mauritius commissioned an investigation by nTan, an accounting firm based in Singapore, into the activities of BAICM from 2007 through 2014. According to the nTan interim report dated 27 January 2016, which is publicly available, BAICM liabilities exceeded assets by MUR 12 billion by the end of financial year 2013, which the group was able to hide by operating Ponzi-like schemes. As characterized by Mauritius, the nTan Report sets out evidence that BAICM channeled funds exceeding MUR 1 billion to Rawat and/or his family members. The nTan Report caveats that the investigation proceeded without informing all individuals and entities investigated, and such individuals and entities were not provided the opportunity to offer comments or corrections and \"[t]his *report should be read subject to this limitation\".*25\n\nnTan Report, p i (Exh C-34).\n\n58.\n\nAccording to the submissions before the Tribunal, Rawat is facing a Warrant to Apprehend in Mauritius for money laundering, conspiracy to defraud, and misuse of company assets. Rawat, who remains outside Mauritius in France, has not been convicted of any of these crimes. According to Mauritius, as a matter of Mauritian criminal law, Rawat faces provisional charges until he can be physically presented before a judge. Receivers of Rawat\u2019s companies have also initiated civil suits in Mauritius, in which Rawat and various family members are named defendants.\n\n59.\n\nIn connection with the criminal investigation, the Mauritius Supreme Court issued an Order on 18 April 2015 listing immovable properties allegedly belonging to Rawat that *\"shall not be disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, by any person, except upon a Judge\u2019s Order\".*26\n\nOrder issued by Her Ladyship, Mrs Gaytree Jugessur-Manna, Judge of the Supreme Court of Mauritius sitting in Chambers dated 18 April 2015, p 2 (Exh C-29).\n\n60.\n\nRawat\u2019s daughters Laina and Adeela Rawat and sons-in-law Brian Bums and Claudio Feistritzer were questioned by Mauritius\u2019 Central Criminal Investigation Department, and arrested and provisionally charged for money laundering, conspiracy to defraud, misuse of company property, and giving false statements. It is undisputed that all were freed on bail. However, they were barred from leaving Mauritius by operation of an Objection to Departure issued by the Mauritius Passport and Immigration Office, and had to surrender their passports to the Mauritius courts. As of 25 April 2017, according to Mauritius, the measures affecting Rawat\u2019s daughters and their husbands objected to by Rawat in the Initial Phase *\"have been abandoned following the closing of the investigations\"*.27\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, p 5, fn 6; Mauritius News, *\"BAI Case - Court strikes out charges against the Rawat sisters\"* dated 25 April 2017 (Exh R-19).\n\n61.\n\nOn 2 December 2015, administrators initiated legal proceedings before Mauritius courts against Rawat through the administrator BDO & Co., claiming the sum of MUR 24 billion.28 On 29 December 2015, the appointed BAICM Special Administrator served a Summons against Rawat and 18 others, claiming MUR 3.5 billion.29 In July 2016, BAICM\u2019s assets, the Apollo Bramwell Hospital and Britam Kenya\u2019s shares were sold.30\n\nClaimant\u2019s Application for Interim Measures, para 48; letter from counsel for BDO & Co. dated 2 December 2015 (Exh C-7).\n\nClaim against the Investor for compensations amounting to MUR 3.5 billion (approximately USD 97 million) (Exh C-71).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Application for Interim Measures, para 28; Plum LLP, Circular to the shareholders of Britam Holdings Limited on the proposed acquisition of four hundred and fifty two million, five hundred and four thousand (452,504,000) ordinary shares by Plum LLP, 30 June 2016 (Exh C-l8); Sixth National Assembly, Parliamentary Debates, First Session, 5 July 2016 (excerpts) pp 71-72 (Exh C-84).\n\n62.\n\nAround 6 to 9 April 2017, Mauritius appointed a Committee of Inquiry to review the sale of BAICM assets.31\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 25 April 2017.\n\n**IV. KEY TREATY PROVISIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out the relevant treaty provisions below and, in the next section, summarizes the Parties\u2019 treaty interpretation submissions.\n\n64.\n\nThe France-Mauritius BIT does not provide for a direct right of arbitration of a treaty dispute between an investor of one Contracting State and the host Contracting State.\n\n65.\n\nArticle 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT provides that investment contracts between an investor and the host state must include a dispute resolution clause providing for International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ***(ICSID)*** arbitration if amicable resolution cannot be reached:\n\n*Les accords relatifs aux investissements a effectuer sur le territoire d\u2019un des Etats contractants, par les ressortissants, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou autres personnes morales de l\u2019autre Etat contractant, comporteront obligatoirement une clause pr\u00e9voyant que les diff\u00e9rends relatifs a ces investissements devront \u00e9tre soumis, au cas ou un accord amiable ne pourrait intervenir \u00e1 bref d\u00e9lai, au Centre international pour le r\u00e9glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements, en vue de leur r\u00e9glement par arbitrage conform\u00e9ment a la Convention sur le r\u00e9glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d\u2019autres Etats.*\n\nIn free translation:\n\n*Agreements relating to investments to be made in the territory of one of the Contracting States by nationals, companies or other legal persons of the other Contracting State, must include a clause providing that their disputes relating to these investments shall be submitted, in the event that an amicable agreement cannot be reached within a short period of time, to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, with a view to their settlement by arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States.*\n\n66.\n\nThe relevant MFN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT, Article 8 paragraph 2, provides:\n\n***Pour les mati\u00e9res regies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention** autres que celles vis\u00e9es a l\u2019article 7* [tax matters], *les investissements des ressortissants, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou autres personnes morales de l\u2019un des Etats contractants b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient \u00e9galement de toutes les dispositions plus favorables que celles du pr\u00e9sent Accord qui pourraient r\u00e9sulter d\u2019obligations internationales d\u00e9jd souscrites ou qui viendraient a \u00e9tre souscrites par cet autre Etat avec le premier Etat contractant ou avec des Etats tiers.* (Emphasis added)\n\nIn free translation:\n\n***For the matters governed by32 the present Convention** other than those referred to in article 7* [tax matters], *investments made by nationals, companies or other legal persons of one of the contracting States shall also benefit from all provisions more favourable than those of the present Agreement, which may result from international obligations already entered into or to be entered into by this other State with the first contracting State or third States.*\n\nRawat translated the introductory clause of Article 8, paragraph 2, as \"[f]*or the subject matter covered by this agreement\"* (Notice of Arbitration, para 70). Mauritius translated the same as \"[f]*or the matters subject to the present Convention\"* (Respondent\u2019s Answer to Rawat Request, para 37). In the Tribunal\u2019s Order Regarding Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s Requests for Interim Measures of 11 January 2017 ***(Interim Measures Order),*** the Tribunal considered that the English verb *\"govern\"* more closely captures the French verb *\"regir\"* in the original text. The difference in translation is of little import, because the French text of the France-Mauritius BIT is the authentic text and the one relied upon by the Tribunal.\n\n67.\n\nArticle 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT of 2007, executed almost 35 years after the France-Mauritius BIT, expressly includes a right for an investor to pursue arbitration directly against the host state:\n\n*1. Any dispute arising directly from an investment between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party should be settled amicably between the two parties to the dispute.*\n\n*2. If the dispute has not been settled within three months from the date on which it was raised in writing, the dispute may, at the choice of the investor, be submitted:*\n\n*(a) to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made; or*\n\n*(b) to arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),...; or*\n\n*(c) to any ad hoc arbitration tribunal which unless otherwise agreed on by the parties to the dispute, is to be established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)....*\n\n68.\n\nIn 2010, Mauritius and France entered into the 2010 France-Mauritius BIT, which expressly includes a right for an investor to pursue ICSID arbitration directly against the host state.33 As of the date of Rawat\u2019s Notice of Arbitration and to the present, France had not ratified the treaty, and it has not come into force.\n\n*Accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique de Maurice sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproque des investissements, sign\u00e9 \u00e1 Port-Louis le 8 mars 2010* (Exh R-14).\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below the Parties\u2019 main positions on the preliminary objections on jurisdiction. Both sides provided the Tribunal with erudite and thorough submissions, both in writing and at the hearing, which we found extremely helpful. Although we recite below what we assessed to be the most significant arguments, we considered each and every point raised by both the Claimant and the Respondent.\n\n**A.

The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Mauritius took the position that the Tribunal should first decide the objection to jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis,* because this objection goes to foundational consent to arbitration:34\n\n*Such a* [consent] *clause is a fundamental basis of jurisdiction in the sense that, in the absence of such a clause, other potential issues relating to the jurisdiction of the tribunal such as jurisdiction ratione temporis, ratione personae or ratione materiae, cannot even arise. As issues relating to the **scope** (rather than the **existence)** of the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the dispute resolution clause, they can only arise if there is a dispute resolution clause in the applicable treaty in the first place.* (Emphasis in original)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 13.\n\n71.\n\nMauritius contends that the lack of consent is clear. There is no clause in the France-Mauritius BIT providing for direct investor-state arbitration and, absent such an arbitration clause, Rawat cannot be allowed to use the MFN clause to import the direct investor-state arbitration clause in the Finland-Mauritius BIT\u2014in its entirety\u2014into the France-Mauritius BIT. To do so, argues Mauritius, would be to use the MFN clause to import basic consent to arbitration, rather than simply more favorable arbitration provisions. As Mauritius has not consented to arbitrate any BIT dispute with Rawat, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis.*\n\n72.\n\nIt is undisputed that there is no direct investor-state arbitration clause in the France-Mauritius BIT. The Claimant acknowledges this in his Notice of Arbitration:35\n\n*The France-Mauritius BIT does not provide for a clause of settlement of [disputes] between a contracting Party and an investor, unless an agreement has been entered into in relation to the investment.*\n\nStatement of Claim, para 68.\n\n73.\n\nThe France-Mauritius BIT does contain a clause\u2014Article 9\u2014providing that investment contracts between a national of one of the Contracting States and the other Contracting State are to contain ICSID arbitration clauses: Article 9 is quoted in paragraph 65 above.\n\n74.\n\nMauritius acknowledges Rawat\u2019s position that Article 9 *\"ensure[s] that the substantial rights established by the BIT will actually be enforced\",* but only inasmuch as disputes arising under investment *contracts* are to be resolved through ICSID *contractual* arbitration.36 Article 9 *\"does not purport to say, and does not say, anything about investor-State arbitration under the Treaty\".*37\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 16.\n\n75.\n\nMauritius submits that the Contracting States have the same understanding of the meaning of Article 9. Mauritius relies primarily on the 2010 France-Mauritius BIT, which does provide for direct investor-state arbitration under the ICSID Convention. As evidenced by the impact assessment study prepared by the French National Assembly, one reason for the new treaty was to *\"modernise\"* the 1973 BIT, including to *\"garantir l\u2019acc\u00e9s \u00e1 une justice neutre et ind\u00e9pendante via l\u2019arbitrage international investisseur-Etat\"* (in free translation: *\"grant... access to neutral and independent justice via investor-State arbitration*\").38 This confirms, says Mauritius, the view of the Contracting States that the 1973 Treaty *\"did **not** contain a dispute resolution clause providing for investor-State arbitration* (emphasis in original).39\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 17; Impact assessment concerning the draft law authorising the approval of the agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments, p 4 (Exh R-15).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 18.\n\n76.\n\nWithout a direct investor-state arbitration clause\u2014at all\u2014in the France-Mauritius BIT, Mauritius denies that Rawat can establish jurisdiction via the MFN clause. Mauritius relies on what it argues is the *\"well-established principle of international law that, to be able to rely on an MFN clause in the basic treaty, a party must first establish the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under that treaty\",40* citing the decision of the International Court of Justice ***(ICJ)*** in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company* case. As found by the tribunal in *Venezuela US, S.R.L. v Venezuela,* where, as here, the issue is consent to direct investor-state arbitration:41\n\n*the MFN clause cannot serve the purpose of importing consent to arbitration when none exists under the* [basic treaty].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 20-35; *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Case (United Kingdom* v *Iran), Preliminary objection,* Judgment of 22 July 1952, (1952) I.C.J. Reports 93, p 109 (Exh RLA-51).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 29; *Venezuela US, S.R.L* v *The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* Interim Award on Jurisdiction, PCA Case No. 2013-34, 26 July 2016, para 105 (Exh RLA-66).\n\n77.\n\nMauritius further contends that, absent clear language otherwise, MFN clauses do not apply to dispute resolution and cannot be used to import dispute resolution clauses from other treaties.42 Here, says Mauritius, the MFN clause\u2014Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT\u2014is silent on dispute resolution and, indeed, the language used implicitly excludes dispute resolution. Interpreting Article 8 with the ordinary meaning rule in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ***(VCLT)*** and the *ejusdem generis* rule, the scope of the MFN treatment obligation is limited to *\"les mati\u00e9res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention\"(\"the* matters governed by the present Convention\").43 As direct investor-state arbitration is not mentioned in the France-Mauritius BIT, it cannot be a *\"mati\u00e9re\"* governed by the Treaty, and it necessarily falls outside the MFN clause.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 37, citing *Plama Consortium Ltd v the Republic of Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, 8 February 2005, para 212 (Exh RLA-53).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 38-43.\n\n78.\n\nFurther, counsel for Mauritius argued at the hearing that Article 8 limits the benefit of the MFN clause to treatment of \"investments\", not \"investors\", even assuming that Claimant were a protected *\"ressortissant\": \"Pour les mati\u00e9res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention..., les **investissements** des ressortissants... b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient \u00e9galement de toutes les dispositions plus favorable que celles du pr\u00e9sent Accord\"* (emphasis added).44 In any event, Mauritius rejects Rawat\u2019s argument that Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT makes dispute resolution a *\"mati\u00e9re\"* governed by the treaty, triggering MFN rights. Counsel emphasized that Article 9 references ICSID arbitration only in the context of future investment *contracts.* Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT deals with *\"the procedure for conclusion of investment contracts\",* while Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT is a *\"jurisdictional clause.\"*45\n\nTranscript, p 39, line 22 to p 40, line 6, Dr Heiskanen.\n\nTranscript, p 41, line 23 to p 42, line 4, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n79.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, Mauritius explains that the *ejusdem generis* rule could allow Rawat to import a more favorable direct investor-state arbitration provision from another BIT, *if* the France-Mauritius BIT contained a direct investor-state arbitration clause of the same *genus,* meaning a similar (but less favorable) clause for direct investor-state arbitration.46 But there is no dispute resolution clause of that *genus* in the France-Mauritius BIT. Mauritius relies on the finding of the tribunal in the *Daimler* v *Argentina* case that the state: *\"must have consented to the particular type of dispute settlement in question before the claimant may raise any MFN claims before the designated forum\"* (emphasis in original).47\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 44.\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG* v *Argentine Republic,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, 22 August 2012, para 204 (Exh RLA-69).\n\n80.\n\nMauritius emphasizes that, except for the *Menzies v Senegal* case, in every case addressing the question of whether an MFN clause can be used to import more favorable arbitral provisions from another treaty, for example, a shorter cooling-off period, the basic treaty contained a direct investor-state arbitration clause.48 Even in *Menzies v Senegal,* where the claimants attempted to invoke consent to arbitration under the General Agreement on Trade in Services ***(GATS),*** which has no investor-state dispute resolution clause, by way of the MFN clause of the GATS and a third-state treaty, the tribunal declined jurisdiction because of the lack of *\"express, clear and unequivocal\"* consent to arbitrate of the host state.49 Mauritius cites commentary in support of its position that the investor must establish the state\u2019s consent to arbitrate in the basic treaty and only then be allowed to invoke an MFN clause to import more favorable provisions from third-state treaties.50\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 48.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 54; *Menzies Middle East and Africa S.A. and Aviation Handling Services International Ltd v Republic of Senegal,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/21, 5 August 2011, para 130 ***(Menzies v Senegal)*** (Exh RLA-18).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 25-26; Z Douglas, \"The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration-Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails\" (2011) (2)1 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 97, p 107 (Exh RLA-32).\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal to follow the same path in the instant arbitration. As counsel submitted in the hearing:51\n\n*The decision on whether international jurisdiction exists cannot be driven by our individual views as to whether extending the scope of international jurisdiction is generally a good thing as a matter of legal policy or otherwise. Whether or not international jurisdiction exists is exclusively a matter of law and evidence, and what is required as a matter of international law is a strict proof of consent.*\n\nTranscript, p 8, lines 1-9, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n82.\n\nAt the hearing, counsel also addressed the Tribunal\u2019s fourth written question concerning the applicability of *effet utile* as a principle of treaty interpretation. Citing the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, counsel described *effet utile* as a principle embodied in the general rule in VCLT Article 31 that a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning given to its terms in context and in light of its object and purpose.52 Investment treaty tribunals have cautioned that *effet utile* cannot be used to justify an illegitimate extension of meaning. As stated by the *Cemex* v *Venezuela* tribunal:53\n\n*[T]his principle does not require that a maximum effect be given to a text. It only excludes interpretations which would render the text meaningless, when a meaningful interpretation is possible.*\n\nTranscript, p 72, line 18 to p 73, line 25, Dr Heiskanen; Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, with Commentaries, text adopted by the International Law Commission at its eighteenth session, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1966, vol. II, p 219 (Exh RLA-108).\n\nTranscript, p 75, lines 15-23, Dr Heiskanen; *CEMEX Caracas Investments B.V. and CEMEX Caracas II Investments B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, 30 December 2010, para 114 ***(CEMEX)*** (Exh RLA-125).\n\n83.\n\nThe *effet utile* principle, argued counsel, *\"cannot be applied to extend the scope of the treaty... contrary to the letter and spirit of the treaty\",* and in this case, *\"it certainly cannot be applied to give effect to the provisions of the France-Mauritius BIT so as to create jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims, whether ratione voluntatis or ratione personae...* [and] *result in creating jurisdiction out of thin air\".54*\n\nTranscript, p 76, lines 6-16, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n***ii. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn his Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Rawat chose first to defend against Mauritius\u2019 jurisdiction *ratione personae* objection, as he argues it goes to his very status as a protected investor under the France-Mauritius BIT and thus to the sheer possibility for him even to invoke the MFN clause.\n\n85.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* objection, Rawat\u2019s main position is that the very broad language in the MFN clause, Article 8, of the France-Mauritius BIT\u2014covering *\"les mati\u00e9res regies par la pr\u00e9sente convention autres que celles vis\u00e9es a l\u2019article 7\" (\"the matters governed by the present Convention other than those referred to in Article* 7\")\u2014allows investors to benefit from all more favorable substantive and procedural treatment granted by either France or Mauritius to third-state investors in other investment treaties. As investor-state dispute resolution is covered in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT, albeit for contractual investor-state arbitration, \"investor-state dispute resolution\"55 is the relevant *\"matiere\"* for purposes of the MFN clause. Therefore, Rawat asserts, Mauritius consented to direct arbitration with French investors as soon as Mauritius entered into an investment treaty with a third state providing access to such direct arbitration, such as the 2007 Finland-Mauritius BIT.56\n\nTranscript, p 132, lines 15-25, Dr Pinna.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 157.\n\n86.\n\nRawat\u2019s case is that Mauritius gave its consent to arbitrate the present dispute in two steps: first, in 1973, when it consented to the MFN clause, drafted in very broad terms, through which it undertook to grant French investors any more favorable treatment that it would grant investors of third states; and second, in 2007, when it offered arbitration in the Finland-Mauritius BIT, granting more favorable treatment to those third-party investors and thus setting the MFN clause into motion.57\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, p 37.\n\n87.\n\nAs a preliminary issue, Rawat contends that it is necessary to interpret the specific language of an MFN clause on a case-by-case basis, applying the rules of interpretation in the VCLT. In support, Rawat cites commentary58 and the International Law Commission\u2019s Final Report of the Study Group on the MostFavoured-Nation Clause ***(ILC Report):** \"the key question of ejusdem generis\u2014what is the scope of the treatment that can be claimed\u2014has to be determined on a case-bycase basis\".*59 The Tribunal should approach interpretation *\"neither restrictively nor expansively but rather objectively and in good faith\".*60\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 162-164, 169; Z Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (Cambridge University Press, 2009), Rule 43, p 344 (Exh CLA-9). E Gaillard, \"Establishing jurisdiction through a Most-Favored-Nation Clause\", New York Law Journal, 2 June 2005, Volume 233, No 105 (Exh CLA-52); SW Sehili, \"Multilateralizing Investment Treaties Through Most-Favored-Nation Clauses\", (2014) 27(2) Berkeley Journal of International Law 496, p 549 (Exh RLA-83).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 161; Final Report of the Study Group on the MostFavoured-Nation clause, Adopted by the International Law Commission at its sixty-seventh session, in 2015, and submitted to the General Assembly, p 26, para 147 ***(ILC Report)*** (Exh CLA-8).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 168.\n\n88.\n\nAmong his arguments, Rawat disagrees with Mauritius on the significance of the 2010 France-Mauritius BIT. Noting that the Contracting States intended the 2010 BIT to *\"modernize\"* the 1973 France-Mauritius BIT and to improve the *\"legal security\"* of foreign investors, he contends that these intentions were fulfilled by making express the procedural rights and substantive protections that investors already enjoyed under the earlier BIT.61 The express right to direct investor-state dispute resolution would serve to enhance legal security.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 202-204.\n\n89.\n\nRawat\u2019s core argument is that the MFN clause, interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, includes investor-state dispute resolution as a covered *\"mati\u00e9r\u00e9\".*\n\n90.\n\nFirst, as a matter of ordinary meaning, the expression *\"mati\u00e9res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente convention\"* is widely recognized to cover dispute resolution mechanisms. Rawat relies on the ILC Report, which identifies six categories of MFN clauses according to their respective drafting features and the common interpretation attached to them by tribunals. Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT, which applies to all *\"mati\u00e9res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente Convention\",* falls under the second category in the ILC Report\u2014MFN clauses that refer *\"to 'all treatment' or 'all matters'governed by the treaty\"\u2014* and tend to be interpreted broadly.62\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 176; ILC Report, supra note 59, p 34, para 197.\n\n91.\n\nIn addition, Rawat refers to the tribunal\u2019s decision in *Maffezini v Spain,* where the MFN clause was applicable to *\"all matters subject to this Agreement\", that \"[n]otwithstanding the fact that the basic treaty containing the clause does not refer expressly to dispute settlement as covered by the most favored nation clause, the Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors\".*63 Rawat also refers to the *Suez* v *Argentina* case and commentary, as supporting the interpretation that the phrase *\"all matters\"* in an MFN clause includes matters relating to dispute settlement.64\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 177; *Emilio Augustin Maffezini* v *Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision of the Tribunal on the objections to jurisdiction dated 25 January 2000, paras 5456 (Exh CL A-10).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 178-182; Sehili, supra note 58 at p 550 (Exh RLA-83); Gaillard, supra note 58 (Exh CLA-52); B Poulain, *\"Clauses de la Nation la Plus Favoris\u00e9e et Clauses d\u2019Arbitrage Investisseur-Etat: est-ce la Fin de la Jurisprudence Maffezini?\",* ASA Bulletin 2/2007 (June), pp 279-340 (Exh CLA-77); *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua* v *Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 16 May 2006, para 59 ***(Suez)***  (Exh CLA-54).\n\n92.\n\nStill examining ordinary meaning, Rawat emphasizes that there is, in fact, an investor-state dispute resolution provision in the France-Mauritius BIT\u2014this is *\"precisely covered by Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT\".*65 Article 9 provides that any agreement concluded between a Contracting State and an investor of the other Contracting State shall contain an arbitration agreement. Rawat argues that this is *how* the *\"mati\u00e9re\"* of \"investor-state arbitration\" is *\"regie\"* (i.e. \"governed\" or \"treated\") in the BIT.66 That this is limited to contractual investor-state arbitration, he says, is justified by the fact that, in 1973, it was not usual for states to include permanent offers to arbitrate in BITs, as compared to investment contracts. Nonetheless, argues Rawat, within this context *\"it is obvious that investor-State arbitration was one of the matters envisaged by the contracting States when they entered into this* BIT\".67\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 185.\n\nTranscript, p 130, lines 1-5, Dr Pinna.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 185.\n\n93.\n\nAs further confirmation that France and Mauritius intended dispute resolution to be among the *\"mati\u00e9res r\u00e9gies par la pr\u00e9sente convention\"* for MFN purposes, Rawat points to the express exclusion of tax matters (Article 7) in Article 8. If the Contracting States had intended also to exclude dispute resolution matters, they would have specified that as they did for tax matters and would have excluded Article 9 from the scope of MFN treatment in addition to Article 7. In support, Rawat refers to the decisions of the tribunals in *Suez v Argentina* and *Gas Natural SDG v Argentina,* which found that where an MFN clause excludes certain matters, the absence of dispute resolution from the excluded matters indicates that dispute resolution was intended to be included for MFN treatment.68\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 187-189; *Suez,* supra note 64, para 56 (Exh CLA-54); *Gas Natural SDG v Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision of the Tribunal on Preliminary Questions on Jurisdiction dated 17 June 2005, para 30 (Exh CLA-55).\n\n94.\n\nSecond, Rawat turns to interpretation of Article 8 in context and in light of the object and purpose of MFN clauses.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Rawat, one reason that states agree to MFN provisions in BITs is so that, at any given time, investors will benefit from the outcome of more successful negotiations with a third state. Here, Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT is more favorable than the France-Mauritius BIT because it allows investors the choice of dispute settlement with a Contracting State before the national courts or an international arbitral tribunal.69\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 197.\n\n96.\n\nAnother reason for states to agree to MFN provisions is to allow a treaty to adapt to legal evolution that cannot be foreseen.70 Rawat submits that, before the *AAPL v Sri Lanka* Award in 1990, France and Mauritius did not expect that a state\u2019s consent to arbitrate with an investor could be inferred directly from an investment treaty.71 Hence, Article 8 *\"comes as an adjustment clause in order to grant the Investor the benefit of the evolution of the analysis of the State\u2019s consent to arbitrate\".*72\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 200-201.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL)* v *Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990 (Exh CLA-13).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 201.\n\n97.\n\nRawat contends that a broad interpretation of Article 8 is consistent with the object and purpose of the France-Mauritius BIT, to *\"prot\u00e9ger et stimuler les investissements\"* (in free translation: *\"protect and stimulate investments\").*73 He cites with approval Professor Stephan Sehili\u2019s opinion that *\"policies underlying investment treaties further justify the broadening of MFN treatment to include the host State\u2019s broader consent to investor-State dispute settlement\",*74\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 208.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 209; Sehili, supra note 58 at p 554 (Exh RLA-83).\n\n98.\n\nThird, Rawat submits that a broad interpretation of Article 8 is confirmed by supplementary means of interpretation, as envisioned in VCLT Article 32.75 He characterizes the debates before the French *S\u00e9nat* in relation to the France-Mauritius BIT, including Article 9 on ICSID arbitration, as emphasizing the importance of arbitration to investment protection.76\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 160 and 210.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 213-214.\n\n99.\n\nFourth, in related vein, Rawat looks to the negotiations of the France-Mauritius BIT to argue that the Contracting States endorsed investor-state dispute resolution. As direct access to investor-state arbitration was not usual at the time of the negotiations, the language of Article 9 reflects the *\"-will of the Parties to submit State-investors disputes to arbitration\"* by contract.77 In that era, the purpose of investment treaties was merely to provide governing rules for investment contracts. It was only after 1990, and the *AAPL v Sri Lanka* developments, that Mauritius changed the drafting of its dispute resolution provisions, such as the one in the Finland-Mauritius BIT. Given the context prior to 1990, Article 9 must be interpreted as a clear expression of the Contracting States\u2019 intent to submit any investor-state disputes to arbitration.78\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 220.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 224-226.\n\n100.\n\nFifth, Rawat turns to the *ejusdem generis* rule of interpretation of MFN clauses. He submits that the *ejusdem generis* rule applies when the basic treaty, here the France-Mauritius BIT, is of the same nature and concerns the same subject matter as the relevant third-state treaty, here the Finland-Mauritius BIT.79 Accordingly, as both the France-Mauritius BIT and the Finland-Mauritius BIT are investment treaties and both have dispute resolution provisions, Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT should be interpreted to allow him to benefit from the more favorable investor-state arbitration rights in the Finland-Mauritius BIT.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 234-237, citing Gaillard, supra note 58 (Exh CLA-52) and Sehili, supra note 58 at p 523 (Exh RLA-83).\n\n101.\n\nRawat disagrees with Mauritius\u2019 position that the *ejusdem generis* rule requires direct investor-state arbitration clauses in both the France-Mauritius and Finland-Mauritius BITs. In his view, the focus for *ejusdem generis* review must be the subject matter of the MFN clause itself rather than the specific treaty provision that is sought to be applied through MFN. In support, he cites the ILC\u2019s commentary on the 1978 Draft Articles on MFN Treatment:80\n\n*It is also not proper to say that the treaty or agreement including the clause must be of the same category (ejusdem generis) as that of the benefits that are claimed under the clause. To hold otherwise would seriously diminish the value of a most-favoured-nation clause.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 246; ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses, with Commentaries 1978, p 30 (Exh RLA-71).\n\n102.\n\nIn any event, Rawat submits that the Finland-Mauritius BIT is of the same nature as the France-Mauritius BIT for purposes of application of the *ejusdem generis* rule81 and that Articles 9 of the two treaties, alternatively, are also of the same nature for these purposes, because they both address the resolution of disputes between investors and a host state, regardless of how consent to arbitration is established in either case (i.e. simultaneously through contract in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT or consent being dissociated in time\u2014\"arbitration without privity\"\u2014in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT).82 In essence, Rawat argues that \"investor-state dispute settlement\" is the *\"matiere\"* of both Articles 9 of the two treaties and that \"arbitration consent to be given by contract\" or \"arbitration consent given under treaty\" are how these *\"mati\u00e9res\"* are \"governed\" or \"treated\" in each treaty respectively.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 232 and 250.\n\nTranscript, p 131, lines 10-12, Dr Pinna; p 133, lines 17-25, Dr Pinna; and p 134, lines 1-3, Dr Pinna.\n\n103.\n\nAs a final argument against Mauritius\u2019 position on the relationship between the MFN clause and consent to arbitration, Rawat submits that the MFN clause, Article 8, of the France-Mauritius BIT automatically went into effect when Mauritius entered into the Finland-Mauritius BIT. This is reflected by use of the verb *\"b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient\"* in Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT, which is in indicative present tense, denoting an imperative in the French language, as opposed to an obligation to do something in the future.83\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 256-257. This is something that the Tribunal had noted in its Interim Measures Order, supra note 32, at footnote 8, p 16.\n\n104.\n\nAt the hearing, Rawat\u2019s counsel addressed the Tribunal\u2019s fourth written question concerning *effet utile* in connection with interpretation of Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT. Counsel agreed with Mauritius\u2019 counsel that *effet utile* is *\"indeed, a principle of interpretation... included in the good faith condition of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention* [with the purpose to avoid] *too restrictive* [an] *interpretation of clauses and of terms that would deprive the clause of any role at all\".*84 Counsel went on to argue that *effet utile* supports Rawat\u2019s interpretation of the MFN clause, which reflects the drafters\u2019 support of arbitration, and undermines Mauritius\u2019 *\"very, very narrow\"* interpretation, which would leave the clause *\"useless\"* with respect to Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT.85\n\nTranscript, p 138, line 23 to p 139, line 14, Dr Pinna.\n\nTranscript, p 139, lines 19-25, Dr Pinna.\n\n105.\n\nIn sum, according to Rawat, with the ratification of the Finland-Mauritius BIT, the direct investor-state arbitration provisions in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT became available to protected French investors by automatic operation of Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT. At that moment, Mauritius consented to arbitrate with French investors, which offer was accepted by Rawat when filing for arbitration in this case.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n***i. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nShould Rawat prevail on the issue of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis,* Mauritius submits that the Tribunal manifestly lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* for three separate reasons.86 First, Rawat has failed to prove his French nationality and, even if he were a French national, the France-Mauritius BIT does not apply to dual nationals. Second, even if the BIT does apply to dual nationals, Rawat\u2019s dominant and effective nationality is Mauritian, and there is no exception in the BIT to the international law principle that a dual national cannot bring a claim against his state of dominant and effective nationality. Third, the BIT requires an investor to have the nationality of a Contracting Party on the date of the relevant investment, and Rawat made his investment before allegedly becoming a French national in 1998.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 56-60.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent, as well as the Claimant, devoted most attention to the dual nationality issue.\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Dual Nationality**\n--------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nMauritius originally challenged Rawat\u2019s status as a French national, arguing that Rawat\u2019s Declaration of Nationality based on marriage to a French national is insufficient proof.87 Following Rawat\u2019s production of his 2015 French passport and 2011 French identification card, Mauritius effectively accepted that Rawat became a French national in December 1998 by reason of marriage. Mauritius\u2019 counsel stated at the hearing:88\n\n*The Claimant has produced new evidence in the Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction to prove his French nationality. This evidence is still unsatisfactory in our view, but for the purposes ofthis hearing the Respondent does not challenge the Claimant\u2019s French nationality.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 62.\n\nTranscript, p 47, line 25 to p 48, line 5; p 57, lines 2-7, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n109.\n\nDual nationality does not support jurisdiction *ratione personae,* submits Mauritius, because the France-Mauritius BIT does not protect dual nationals.\n\n110.\n\nMauritius relies most heavily to support this argument on the text of Article 1(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT, in specific the reference therein to investments made by the ***\"ressortissants,** soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou autres personnes morales de Tun des Etats contractants\"* (emphasis added).89 Mauritius distinguishes use of the French term *\"ressortissants\"* in the 1973 BIT from use of the broader term *\"nationaux\"* in more recent investment treaties concluded by France.90\n\nFrance-Mauritius BIT, Article 1(2) (Exh C-l).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 64.\n\n111.\n\nThe term *\"ressortissant\",* contends Mauritius, has an established ordinary meaning in the French language that specifically excludes dual nationals.91 In support, Mauritius cites the *Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie francaise,* described as having the status of an official administrative document, and the *Larousse* dictionary, which define *\"ressortissant\"* as a person possessing the nationality of a state and who benefits from that state\u2019s diplomatic and consular protection outside that state.92\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 64-65.\n\n*Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie francaise* (9th ed), JORF (2017) dated 26 January 2017, p 1 (Exh R-23): *\"Toute personne poss\u00e9dant la nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019un Etat et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant a l\u2019\u00e9tranger de sa protection diplomatique et consulaire\"; Larousse online dictionary* (last visited on 4 July 2017) (Exh R-24): *\"Personne prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par les repr\u00e9sentants diplomatiques ou consulaires d\u2019un pays donn\u00e9, lorsqu'elle r\u00e9side dans un autre pays\".*\n\n112.\n\nTo qualify as a French *\"ressortissant\"* under the France-Mauritius BIT, therefore, Rawat must prove not only that he is a French national, but also that he is entitled to the benefits of consular and diplomatic protection of France in Mauritius.93 He cannot do this, because the official position of the French Government is that it does not grant consular or diplomatic protection to French citizens who are also nationals of the state in which they reside or travel. To quote from the website of the French Government:94\n\n*Un Francais binational ne peut... pas faire pr\u00e9valoir sa nationalit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise aupr\u00e9s des autorit\u00e9s de l\u2019autre ou des autres Etat(s) dont il poss\u00e9de aussi la nationalit\u00e9 lorsqu'il r\u00e9side sur son territoire.

This dual national or multi-national is then generally considered by these States as their **exclusive ressortissant** and it follows that France cannot exercise its diplomatic protection against the dual national\u2019s other State of nationality.* (Emphasis added)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 66-68.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 68; extract from the website of the French Government (last visited on 4 July 2017) https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F334 (Exh R-26).\n\n113.\n\nIn sum, even as a French-Mauritian dual national, Rawat cannot qualify as a French *\"ressortissant\"* under the France-Mauritius BIT.95\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 69.\n\n114.\n\nIn reliance on Article 31 of the VCLT, Mauritius adds that this ordinary meaning interpretation of *\"ressortissant\"* is supported by the context and object and purpose of the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n115.\n\nAs for object and purpose, Mauritius looks to the Preamble of the France-Mauritius BIT, where the two states recite that they are \"[a]*nimated by the desire to intensify economic cooperation between the two countries* [and] [i]*nterested to this effect in protecting and stimulating investments\".*96 This can only mean protection of foreign investment, says Mauritius, not domestic investment. In support, Mauritius cites the *Lemire* v *Ukraine* ICSID Award:97\n\n***States confer rights to foreign investors, which are unavailable to their own citizens.***\n\n\u2026\n\n*The different treatment between foreign and domestic investors is a natural consequence of a BIT. However, this unequal treatment is not without justification: justice is not to grant everyone the same, but suum cuique tribuere. Foreigners, who lack political rights, are more exposed than domestic investors to arbitrary actions of the host State and may thus, as a matter of legitimate policy, be granted a wider scope of protection.* (Emphasis added)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 73 (in free translation).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 74; *Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, 28 March 2011, paras 56-57 (Exh RLA-89).\n\n116.\n\nTurning to context, Mauritius argues that the term *\"ressortissant\"* is not used synonymously with \"national\" in the BIT. The term \"national\" does not appear and the term *\"ressortissant\"* is expressly used in all articles of the treaty except Articles 11 and 12. Most significantly, the term *\"ressortissant\"* is used in connection with contractual ICSID arbitration.98 Article 9 provides that investment contracts between a Contracting State and a *\"ressortissant\"* (or a company or other legal entity) of the other Contracting State *\"must include a clause providing that their disputes relating to these investments shall be submitted, to...* [ICSID], *with a view to their settlement by arbitration, in accordance with the* [ICSID Convention]\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 70-72.\n\n117.\n\nIn turn, Article 25(2)(a) of the official English version of the ICSID Convention expressly excludes from arbitral jurisdiction *\"any person who... also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\".*99 The official French version of Article 25(2)(a) uses the term *\"ressortissant\"* in this context:100\n\n*\"Ressortissant d\u2019un autre Etat contractant\" signifle :*\n\n*(a) toute personne physique qui poss\u00e9de la nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019un Etat contractant autre que l\u2019Etat partie au diff\u00e9rend \u00e1 la date \u00e1 laquelle les parties ont consent\u00ed a soumettre le diff\u00e9rend a la conciliation ou a l\u2019arbitrage ainsi qu'a la date a\u00a0laquelle la requete a ete enregistree ... **a l'exclusion de toute personne qui,\u00a0a l'une ou a l'autre de ces dates, possede egalement Ia nationalite de l'Etat\u00a0contractant partie au differend;***\n\nThe English official version reads as follows:101\n\n*\"National of another Contracting State \" means:*\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered..., **but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute;***(Emphasis added)\n\nICSID Convention (English official version), p 18, Article 25(2)(a) (Exh RLA-87).\n\nICSID Convention (French official version), p 18, Article 25(2)(a) (Exh RLA-88).\n\nICSID Convention (English official version), p 18, Article 25(2)(a) (Exh RLA-87).\n\n118.\n\nRelying on the context of Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT read with Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, Mauritius argues that the BIT *\"therefore makes clear that dual nationals are not covered by the Treaty\".*102 The ICSID Convention and the reference to it in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT support interpreting *\"ressortissant\"* to exclude dual nationals under VLCT Article 31(1), with Article 9 as context, and under VCLT Article 31(3)(c), with ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(a) as a relevant rule of international law applicable between Mauritius and France.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 72-73.\n\n119.\n\nAt the hearing, counsel specifically addressed the Tribunal\u2019s second written question, namely the relationship between the ICSID Convention and the France-Mauritius BIT and, *\"more particularly the meaning of the term \"ressortissants \" in Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and in Article 1(2) of the France-Mauritius treaty\".* Counsel took the position that Article 9 offers no consent to jurisdiction for direct investor-state arbitration:103\n\n*Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT is not a jurisdictional clause. There is no consent to arbitrate. It simply requires \u2014 creates an obligation for the State parties to consent to arbitrate in an investment contract.*\n\nTranscript, p 168, lines 3-7, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n120.\n\nMauritius\u2019 counsel argued further that the France-Mauritius BIT should be interpreted in accordance with the ICSID Convention:104\n\n[Rawat] *cannot escape the effects of the ICSID Convention, since the ICSID Convention is the only treaty that is referred to in this BIT, and it therefore forms part of the context of interpretation of this treaty.*\n\nTranscript, p 53, lines 7-10, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n121.\n\nMauritius\u2019 counsel submitted that if an ICSID arbitration clause were to be inserted into an investment contract with Rawat, it would not be enforceable:105\n\n*Now, to conclude on the issue of context and Article 31.3(c), if the term, \"ressortissants\", is not given the same meaning in the French \u2014 France-Mauritius BIT and the ICSID Convention, if it is not given the meaning excluding dual nationals, this would lead to the absurd result that Mauritius, if it entered into an Investment Contract with Mr Rawat, would be under an obligation to include, in that contract, an ICSID arbitration clause that would be unenforceable.*\n\nTranscript, p 55, lines 11-19, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n122.\n\nIn summary, whether looking to plain meaning of the term *\"ressortissant\",* the context or the object and purpose of the France-Mauritius BIT, Mauritius argues that the treaty does not protect the Claimant as a dual national.\n\n**b. The Claimant\u2019s Dominant and Effective Nationality**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nEven if the France-Mauritius BIT could be interpreted to protect dual French-Mauritian nationals, Mauritius argues that Rawat\u2019s claims would fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae,* because the international law rule of \"dominant and effective nationality\" is applicable under the BIT and Rawat\u2019s dominant and effective nationality is indisputably Mauritian.\n\n124.\n\nMauritius first explains that, while classic international law excluded claims by dual nationals against states\u2014as reflected in the terms of the France-Mauritius BIT and the ICSID Convention\u2014a *\"further and more nuanced rule\"* has developed allowing claims by dual nationals who can establish that their dominant and effective nationality is that of their espousing state (for diplomatic protection) or their home state (for direct claims).106 In support, Mauritius cites the ICJ\u2019s judgment in *Nottebohm* and other diplomatic protection related authorities.107 Mauritius further cites the *Case No. A/18* decision of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal ***(IUSCT)***  as:108\n\n*an important development in the application of the dominant and effective nationality rule... because, as the IUSCT noted, arbitration before the IUSCT did not represent a form of diplomatic protection. Private parties had direct access to the IUSCT and accordingly the dominant and effective nationality rule came to be applied primarily as a jurisdictional rule rather than as a rule of admissibility....*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 76-77.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 78-81; *Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein* v *Guatemala),* Judgment of 6 April 1955, (1955) I.C.J.

II, Part Two, p 43 ***(ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection)*** (Exh RLA-91).\n\n126.\n\nMauritius acknowledges that the dominant and effective nationality rule is not a *jus cogens* norm, and accordingly state parties to a treaty\u2014which would be *lex specialis\u2014* may consent to allow their own nationals to assert claims against them. However, argues Mauritius, the dominant and effective nationality rule must apply in the instant case absent a clearly stated exception regarding dual nationals in the France-Mauritius BIT. As there is no such exception, the BIT reflects the classic rule of international law that excludes claims by dual nationals against either of their states of nationality, and the dominant and effective nationality rule applies.110 This follows from VCLT Article 31(3)(c), which directs that account must be taken of *\"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\"* in interpreting the treaty.111\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 104-110.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 105-107.\n\n127.\n\nIn applying the dominant and effective nationality rule, tribunals examine the facts of the overall life of the relevant individual. As stated by the *Ballantine* v *Dominican Republic* tribunal, absent any express standards in the relevant treaty, the elements include:112\n\n*the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, the individual\u2019s personal attachment for a particular country, and the center of the person\u2019s economic, social and family life.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 86; *Michael Ballantine and Lisa Ballantine* v *The Dominican Republic,* Procedural Order No. 2, PCA Case No. 2016-17, 21 April 2017, p 6, para 25 (Exh RLA-101).\n\n128.\n\nSecond, Mauritius contends that the relevant elements readily demonstrate that Rawat is dominantly and effectively a Mauritian national.\n\n129.\n\nAs set out in the Factual Background above, the Claimant\u2019s links to Mauritius are long and deep.113 He was bom and raised in Mauritius and, with the exception of three years in the United States and his recent residency in France, has had his habitual residence in Mauritius. He was married in Mauritius, and his children were all bom in Mauritius, married Mauritian nationals, and reside in Mauritius. He owns substantial property in Mauritius, including what he considers to be his principal residence. He holds a Mauritian driving license and is registered to vote in Mauritius. He has held management positions or shares in at least 65 companies incorporated in Mauritius. He has always used his Mauritian passport to enter Mauritius and, apparently except on two occasions, has always used his Mauritian passport to enter France.114 To the best of Mauritius\u2019 knowledge, Rawat has not made any application under the applicable Mauritian law to acquire his properties as a foreign national.115\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 88-97.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 97; Mauritian movement summary and passport and immigration office travel history of Mr Rawat, p 13 (Exh R-51).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 90.\n\n130.\n\nIn comparison, says Mauritius, Rawat\u2019s links to France are tenuous.116 He apparently spent only two years in France over 51 years, and has no significant business interests or assets there. He was awarded the French *Legion d\u2019Honneur* as a foreigner, nominated by the Protocol Service of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for his long service as president of an investment company in Mauritius.117\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 98-99.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 99; *Code de la l\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur et de la m\u00e9daille militaire,* pp 15 and 37 (Exh R-52); *Pr\u00e9sidence de la R\u00e9publique, Ordre national de la l\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, D\u00e9cret portant promotion et nomination, JORF* (2014) dated 11 July 2014, p 5 (Exh R-53); excerpt from the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Exh R-54).\n\n**c. The Claimant\u2019s Nationality at the Time of Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nMauritius\u2019 third and final argument against jurisdiction *ratione personae* is that, even accepting that Rawat acquired French nationality in 1998, he was not a French national when he acquired his relevant interests in Mauritius, in his own terms, from the *\"late eighties\"* to 1992.118\n\nWitness Statement of Dawood Rawat dated 29 July 2016, p 2 *et seq* (Exh C-50).\n\n132.\n\nMauritius relies on Article 1(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT, which provides for protection of *\"les investissements que les ressortissants... de l\u2019un des Etats contractants ont, en conformit\u00e9 de la l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019autre Etat contractant, effectu\u00e9s* [made]... *sur le territoire de ce dernier\".*119 As Rawat was exclusively a Mauritian national when he made the relevant investments in BAIC and BAI from the late eighties to 1992, he is not a protected investor under the BIT.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 117-119.\n\n***ii. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant disputes all of the Respondent\u2019s arguments on jurisdiction *ratione personae.* Rawat asserts that, if the France-Mauritius BIT is interpreted properly under VLCT Article 31, the only relevant requirement of the BIT is that he be a national of one of the Contracting States\u2014which he is. There is no need, submits Rawat, for the Tribunal to address his status as a dual national or his dominant and effective nationality.\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Dual Nationality**\n--------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nFirst, Rawat focuses substantial attention on the ordinary meaning of the term *\"ressortissant\"* in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT. He argues that the non-legal definitions of *\"ressortissant\"* in French language dictionaries cited by the Respondent cannot, apply in interpreting the BIT in context. As the term *\"ressortissant\"* is not defined in the France-Mauritius BIT, it should be used as a synonym of the term *\"national\"* according to French law and conventional practice in the context of investment treaties.120\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 35-36.\n\n135.\n\nRawat emphasizes that French law on nationality does not distinguish between *\"ressortissants\"* and *\"nationaux\".* Several provisions of the French Civil Code refer to these terms interchangeably in designating natural persons holding French nationality.121\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 37-38. Rawat cites, in particular, Article 21-13-1 of the French Civil Code, which provides that a person can be granted French nationality through a declaration if, amongst other conditions, he is a direct ascendant of a French *\"ressortissant\"* (Exh CLA-78).\n\n136.\n\nFurther, Rawat submits that the definitions given to the terms *\"ressortissants\"* and *\"nationaux\"* in other BITs are important, as states rely on prior practice in treaty negotiations. Based on BITs concluded by France between 1960 and 1990, in which both terms are defined as *\"les personnes physiques poss\u00e9dant la nationalit\u00e9 de Tune des Parties contractantes\"*,122 Rawat asks the Tribunal to infer that the drafters of the France-Mauritius BIT did not intend to distinguish between *\"nationaux\"* and *\"ressortissants\"*. In particular, Rawat cites the examples of the 1978 France-Jordan BIT, the 1977 France-Korea BIT and the 1978 France-Sudan BIT, which use the term *\"nationaux\"* to define protected individual investors, and the term *\"ressortissant\"* to describe the protection granted to these persons.123 Moreover, the term *\"ressortissant\"* used in Article 3 of the Hague Convention on Certain Questions relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws, adopted by Mauritius in 1969, is defined as *\"national\"', \"a person having two or more nationalities may be regarded as its national by each of the States whose nationality he possesses\".*124\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 40-41.\n\n*Convention entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement du Royame Hach\u00e9mite de Jordanie sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection des investissements,* 23 February 1978 (entered into force on 18 October 1979) (Exh CLA-25); *Accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique de Cor\u00e9e sur I 'encouragement et la protection des investissements, sign\u00e9 a Paris le 28 d\u00e9cembre 1977* (entered into force on 1 February 1979), Article 3, (Exh CLA-32); *Convention entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Soudan sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements, sign\u00e9e \u00e1 Paris le 31 juillet 1978* (entered into force on 5 July 1980), Article 8 (Exh CLA-26).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 43; Convention on Certain Questions relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws, signed at The Hague on 12 April 1930, Article 3, (Exh CLA-15) (Claimant\u2019s free translation from French original: \"[s]ows *r\u00e9serve des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente convention, un individu poss\u00e9dant deux ou plusieurs nationalit\u00e9s pourra \u00e9tre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, par chacun des Etats dont il a la nationalit\u00e9 comme son ressortissant\").*\n\n137.\n\nSecond, Rawat looks to the object and purpose in the Preamble of the France-Mauritius BIT to *\"intensify the economic cooperation between the two States\"* and to *\"protect and encourage investments\",*125 Rawat argues that dual French-Mauritian nationals who invest either in Mauritius or France self-evidently do contribute to the economic cooperation between these two States. He relies on the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal in *Venezuela v Garcia Armas,* which noted the object and purpose of the relevant treaty in refusing to distinguish between single and dual nationals regarding their eligibility to protection *ratione personae* under the treaty.126\n\nFrance-Mauritius BIT (Claimant\u2019s free translation from French original: *\"intensifier la coop\u00e9ration \u00e9conomique entre les deux pays\", \"prot\u00e9ger et stimuler les investissements\").*\n\n*Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* v *Seraf\u00edn Garcia Armas and Karina Garcia Gruber,* Court of Appeal of Paris, RG No. 15/01040, Decision of 25 April 2017 ***(Venezuela v Garcia Armas)*** (Exh RLA-115). The tribunal\u2019s award was eventually partially set aside by the Paris Court of Appeal, on a different ground.\n\n138.\n\nThird, emphasizing that the France-Mauritius BIT does not contain any condition on the nationality of natural person investors other than being a *\"ressortissant\"* of one of the Contracting States, Rawat cautions that additional conditions cannot be added to the BIT. This is what the Tribunal would be doing, argues Rawat, if it were to accede to the Respondent\u2019s request to examine his dominant and effective nationality as an international law rule applicable between the Contracting States under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. In support, he cites findings by the *Saluka v Czech Republic* and *Oostergetel v Slovak Republic* tribunals that the relevant BIT did not require the investor\u2019s nationality to be *\"effective\"* or impose further conditions such as the existence of a genuine link to the non-host state,127 and that the treaty\u2019s object and purpose to promote mutual investment would not be furthered if dual nationals are excluded from protection.128\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 54-56; *Saluka Investments B.V. v Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, paras 229 and 241 (Exh CLA-33); *Oostergetel* v *Slovak Republic Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL Ad Hoc Arbitration, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 April 2010, para 130 (Exh CLA-16).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 57-59; *V\u00edctor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Award I, 8 May 2008, para 415 ***(Pey Casado*** v ***Chile)*** (Exh CLA-34); *Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas and Karina Garcia Gruber* v *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2013-3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2014, paras 180-181 **(Garcia Armas v Venezuela)**  (Exh CLA-35).\n\n139.\n\nRawat adds that if France and Mauritius had intended to set additional limitations on jurisdiction *ratione personae,* they would have expressly done so. Both France and Mauritius have expressly provided such restrictions in many other treaties, for example, the France-China BIT and the Mauritius-Egypt BIT.129\n\n*Accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique populaire de Chine sur l 'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements, 30 May 1984* (entered into force on 19 March 1985, terminated), Article 1(3) (Exh CLA-37); Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments, 25 June 2014 (entered into force on 17 October 2014), Article 1(3) (Exh CLA-40).\n\n140.\n\nFourth, Rawat points out that unlike Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the UNCITRAL Rules\u2014under which this arbitration is filed\u2014do not contain an express exclusion of dual national claims against a host state. Indeed, argues Rawat, the need for the express exclusion of dual national jurisdiction in the ICSID Convention demonstrates the common understanding under international law that dual nationals are not precluded from bringing claims against one of their states of nationality. The ICSID exclusion of dual nationals, therefore, cannot be generalized to investment treaty arbitration under other rules.130\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 70.\n\n141.\n\nAt the hearing, addressing the Tribunal\u2019s second written question, counsel took the position that the question of nationality must be assessed separately under the France-Mauritius BIT and the ICSID Convention. Counsel argued that the term *\"ressortissant\"* in the France-Mauritius BIT has a different ordinary meaning than *\"ressortissant\"* in the ICSID Convention. While the ordinary meaning is as *\"a synonym of, \"National\"* [and] *does not exclude dual national*\",131 the term is a *\"precisely and... specifically-defined term in the ICSID Convention\".*132\n\n*The reference in the ICSID Convention \u2014 the reference to the ICSID Convention in Article 9 of the BIT cannot be interpreted as restricting the meaning of the term, \"ressortissants\", and restricting the meaning of the term, \"ressortissants\", to physical persons having the nationality of only one contracting State, and not to the State nationality of the host State of the investment.*\n\nTranscript, p 107, lines 21-24, Dr Pinna.\n\nTranscript, p 109, lines 15-16; p 109, line 22 to p 110, line 4, Dr Pinna.\n\n142.\n\nThe very length of the definition of *\"ressortissant\"* in the ICSID Convention, argued counsel, shows that the term is not being used in its general sense because *\"[i]f this was the ordinary meaning of the term, it was not necessary to go into such a long definition\".*133\n\nTranscript, p 107, lines 19-20, Dr Pinna.\n\n143.\n\nCounsel cautioned against interpreting the general coverage of claims under the France-Mauritius BIT against the specific reference in Article 9 to mandatory inclusion of ICSID arbitration clauses in investment contracts:134\n\n[I]*t would be very artificial to try to find in the language of Article 9 a specific definition, a delimitation of the general scope of application of the treaty. Article 9 and the specific condition of Article 9, Investment Contract, are very limited, the scope is much more broad.*\n\nTranscript, p 111, lines 19-24, Dr Pinna.\n\n144.\n\nCounsel stressed that Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT reflects Mauritius\u2019 general willingness to settle investment disputes by arbitration.135\n\nTranscript, p 116, lines 1-14, Dr Pinna.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, Rawat submits that the Tribunal, in interpreting the France-Mauritius BIT under VCLT Article 31(3)(c), may refer to rules of international law only if their application to a particular issue is not disputed, which distinguishes rules from broader principles or considerations that may not be firmly established.136 The dominant and effective nationality concept, says Rawat, is not such a rule of international law applicable to investor-state disputes. It was developed in the limited context of diplomatic protection. The diplomatic protection cases cited by Mauritius, and the awards of the special-purpose Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, are not relevant to a determination of whether this rule applies in the context of investment treaty protection generally.137 Investment treaty tribunals, including in the cases of *Micula* v *Romania* and *Pey Casado* v *Chile,* have repeatedly found that diplomatic protection rules, and in particular the dominant and effective nationality principle, do not apply in investor-state disputes, absent express inclusion as in the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement.138\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 72-76; C McLachlan, \"The Principle of Systemic Integration and Article 31(3)(C) of the Vienna Convention\", (2005) 54(2) The International and Comparative Law Quarterly 279, p 290 (Exh RLA-107).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 77-79 and 80-91.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 92; *Micula et al. v Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, para 99 (Exh CLA-45); *Pey Casado* v *Chile,* supra note 128, para 415.\n\n146.\n\nIn sum, Rawat submits that the France-Mauritius BIT constitutes *lex specialis* for the Parties and, absent the express inclusion of the dominant and effective nationality rule in the treaty, excludes application of the rule. Rawat\u2019s interpretation of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection is that they cannot be applied when they are *\"inconsistent\"* with *\"provisions for the protection of investments\",* which is the case with the France-Mauritius BIT.139\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 103-105; ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, supra note 109, pp 89-90.\n\n**b. The Claimant\u2019s Dominant and Effective Nationality**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nAs Rawat does not accept the applicability of the dominant and effective nationality rule, he offered no submissions on his dominant and effective nationality. He did not materially dispute the facts alleged by Mauritius as to his comparative links to Mauritius and France.\n\n**c. The Claimant\u2019s Nationality at the Time of Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nRawat rejects Mauritius\u2019 submission that he must prove he was a French national when he made\u2014 *\"a effectu\u00e9\"\u2014* his original investments in Mauritius. He contends that, for the purposes of personal jurisdiction, he had to be\u2014and was\u2014a French national when Mauritius allegedly breached its BIT obligations in 2015 and when he submitted his Notice of Arbitration in late 2015.140\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 120.\n\n149.\n\nIn support, Rawat relies on the tribunal decisions in *Pey Casado* v *Chile* and in *Garcia Armas* v *Venezuela.*141 In the latter case, the Paris Court of Appeal notably confirmed that it was enough in order to establish the *ratione personae* jurisdiction of the tribunal, that one of the contracting states should recognize the investor as its own national at the time the investor brought the relevant treaty claim.142 He further relies on leading commentary.143\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 121-126; *Pey Casado* v *Chile,* supra note 128, para 414; *Garcia Armas* v *Venezuela,* supra note 128.\n\nThe Paris Court of Appeal however partially set aside the award on the basis of a mixed *ratione materia/ratione temporis* objection, *ie* that the specific language in the relevant treaty required, in its view, the investments to have been made at a time when the investor already held the home state\u2019s nationality. *Venezuela* v *Garcia Armas,* supra note 126, p 7.\n\nFor example, R Dolzer and C Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law (2012), p 252 (Exh CLA-47).\n\n150.\n\nRawat argues that, in any event, his original investments continued for approximately 40 years, with reinvestment of profit and dividends. In his view:144\n\n*It would therefore be artificial to require an investor, and in particular Mr Rawat, to hold the nationality of one of the contracting parties to a bilateral investment treaty at the time of the first purchase of the shares that constitutes only the first step of the whole investment under consideration.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 148.\n\n**C. The Relief Requested**\n---------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction, and order the Claimant to pay Respondent\u2019s costs on a full indemnity basis as defined in Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, rule that it has jurisdiction to decide the merits of the claims, and order the Respondent to pay all costs of this phase of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Sequence for Addressing the Jurisdictional Objections**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nAs noted in the Procedural History section above, the Tribunal posed four written questions to the Parties in advance of the jurisdiction hearing. The first was: *\"Whether the order in which the Tribunal assesses the two jurisdictional objections regarding nationality and MFN objections has significance and, if so, why?\"*\n\n154.\n\nRawat\u2019s counsel took the position at the hearing that the nationality objection should come first because it concerns the very *applicability* of the France-Mauritius BIT to Rawat as a protected investor, which must be determined before examining the applicability of the MFN clause:145\n\n*[T]he question of nationality, whether Mr Rawat is a protected investor under the BIT, concerns the general scope of application, the applicability of the treaty in general as a whole. On the other hand, the question of the MFN clause to determine whether it applies to jurisdictional protection, or to the jurisdictional protection Mr Rawat is asking, is a question of applicability of only one clause of the treaty, of Article 8.2. This question arises once and only once the claim of Mr Rawat is considered to fall within the general scope of application of the treaty.*\n\nTranscript, p 85, lines 8-18, Dr Pinna.\n\n155.\n\nMauritius\u2019 counsel took the opposite position on grounds that the MFN objection relates to the *existence* of Mauritius\u2019 consent to arbitration, which must be determined before assessing the *scope* of that consent, including whether Rawat is a protected investor:146\n\n*So the sequence is first you have an Arbitration Agreement, then you can make an MFN claim. An MFN clause is not a jurisdictional clause.*\n\nTranscript, p 27, lines 19-21, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n156.\n\nCounsel for Mauritius, without disagreement from Rawat\u2019s counsel, acknowledged at the hearing that the Tribunal has full discretion to set the order for determining the preliminary jurisdictional objections:147\n\n*The Tribunal certainly remains free to choose the legal basis of its decision, so if the Tribunal decides that the nationality issue is more appropriately addressed first, it is certainly free to do so, and choose the basis of its legal decision. This doesn't change the \u2014 what we just said, but it is the exercise of discretion that the Tribunal has on this issue.*\n\nTranscript, p 4, lines 17-23, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the jurisdiction *ratione personae* objection. Although we first examine that objection, as proposed by Rawat, we consider the question of Rawat\u2019s status as a dual French-Mauritian national fundamentally to raise an issue of consent to jurisdiction as well, as prioritized by Mauritius.\n\n**B. Analysis of Consent**\n--------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mauritius that consent to arbitration is foundational to jurisdiction. This is in fact common ground between the Parties. All objections to jurisdiction, be they of a *ratione personae, ratione materiae* or *ratione temporis* nature, are for this reason sub-types of *ratione voluntatis* objections. The first question before us is whether Mauritius, as a Contracting State, consented to confer jurisdiction on the Tribunal to resolve this dispute with this Claimant.\n\n159.\n\nThe analysis of consent requires two steps.\n\n160.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal must determine if the 1973 France-Mauritius BIT applies, meaning whether the disputed conditions for application are met. If the treaty *does not* apply, consent to jurisdiction is missing, and Rawat is not entitled to any of the substantive protections provided in the BIT, including access to the MFN clause in Article 8.\n\n161.\n\nThe second step is necessary if the BIT *does* apply. This step would entail examining, in the absence of an express direct investor-state arbitration provision in the BIT, whether the MFN clause in Article 8 operates to demonstrate Mauritius\u2019 consent to such direct arbitration through application of the direct investor-state arbitration clause in the 2007 Finland-Mauritius BIT.\n\n***i. Step 1: Does the France-Mauritius BIT Apply?***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThere is no dispute that, for purposes of the condition in Article 1(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT, Rawat made substantial *\"investissements\"* (investments) in Mauritius over a long period of time. This is reflected in the Factual Background section above.\n\n163.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT does not use the term *\"investisseur\"* (investor), but only the term *\"ressortissant\",* the precise meaning of which (in French or English) is not agreed between the Parties. It plainly is a condition of application of the BIT that a natural person claiming protection, such as Rawat, be a *\"ressortissant\"* of France or Mauritius. The term *\"ressortissant\"* is used in every article of the BIT except Articles 11 and 12, which deal with the purely state-level issues of entry into force, denunciation and implementation of the treaty in the domestic legislation of the Contracting States.\n\n164.\n\nThe question, therefore, is whether Rawat is a French *\"ressortissant\"*, as understood under the BIT, who can invoke the protections of the BIT against Mauritius.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that Rawat is a French national, and was a French national long before this dispute arose and he commenced arbitration.148 Whether or not Mauritius definitively waived its objections to Rawat\u2019s proof of his French nationality at the hearing, we find the evidence sufficient to prove that he became a French national in 1998 by operation of French law, following registration of his Declaration of Nationality based on marriage to a French national. (Factual Background, paragraph 48) Further, although Mauritius explained that one need not be a French national to be made a knight of the French *L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur,* the fact remains that when Rawat was so honored he received it *\"as a French and Mauritian citizen\".* (Factual Background, paragraph 50)\n\nThe Tribunal need not resolve the Parties\u2019 dispute as to whether Rawat also had to be a French national before he made the relevant investments in Mauritius, in light of our dismissal of his claims on other grounds.\n\n166.\n\nIt is undisputed that Rawat is also a Mauritian national, and has been since his birth in Mauritius in 1944. The Tribunal notes that, if we had to determine Rawat\u2019s dominant and effective nationality, the basic facts of his connections to Mauritius recited in the Factual Background readily show that he is dominantly and effectively Mauritian. As will be clear from the analysis to follow, such a determination is immaterial to resolution of the present dispute.\n\n167.\n\nWhat is material, for purposes of determining the applicability of the France-Mauritius BIT to the present case, is that Rawat is a dual national of Mauritius and France.\n\n168.\n\nThe first and key legal question, then, is whether the term *\"ressortissant\",* as used throughout the France-Mauritius BIT includes or excludes dual nationals. The question of whether an individual (or legal entity) is a national or *\"ressortissant\"* of a state is a question of municipal law. Whether that nationality, once demonstrated, has legal effects on the international plane\u2014the plane of investment treaties\u2014is a question of international law.149\n\n*D\u00e9crets tunisiens et marocains de nationalit\u00e9,* PCIJ Reports, Series B, Advisory Opinion No. 4, 7 February 1923, p 24 (CLA-14); ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, supra note 109, pp 31-35; *Soufraki* v *United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Award, 7 July 2004, para 55 (Exh RLA-85); *Pey Casado* v *Chile,* supra note 128, paras 255-257, 319.\n\n169.\n\nThis brings the Tribunal to the challenge of interpreting the relevant provisions of the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts, as argued by Rawat, that we are not to add conditions to the BIT, as drafted and ratified by France and Mauritius. There is no express exclusion of dual nationals from protections under the BIT, unlike other investment treaties entered into by both Mauritius and France (referenced in paragraph 139 above). This would seem to point to the inclusion, rather than the exclusion, of dual nationals within the scope of the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n171.\n\nThis is not the end of the matter, however. As both Parties emphasized, the lodestar for our finding on how dual nationals are to be treated under the BIT must be Article 31(1) of the VCLT. Under Article 31(1), we are to interpret terms in the BIT\u2014 including the term *\"ressortissant\"\u2014* according to *\"the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their **context** and in the light of its object and purpose\"* (emphasis added).\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, but for the requirement that we take the context of the ordinary meaning of the term *\"ressortissant\"* into account, the object and purpose of the France-Mauritius BIT would also point to the outcome of including, rather than excluding, dual nationals as protected *\"ressortissants\"* within the ambit of the BIT. The Preamble highlights the goal of the treaty to *\"protect and stimulate\"* investment, and the BIT does not distinguish between the possible sources of the investments sought. Other investment treaty tribunals have reached the same conclusion, for example in the cases of *Pey Casado v Chile* and in *Garcia Armas v Venezuela,* as cited by Rawat.150\n\nAs will be clear from the following discussion, the Tribunal does not purport to disagree with the conclusions reached by the tribunals in these two cases, but deems that the context of the two treaties involved in these cases, the Spain-Chile BIT on the one hand, and the Spain-Venezuela BIT on the other hand, was different. Importantly, these treaties provided for a *menu* of jurisdictional options for investors. They did not make it an *obligation* for investors to bring disputes against the host state before an arbitral tribunal constituted under the auspices of ICSID, unlike what is set out in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT in the present case.\n\n173.\n\nHowever, in addition to the object and purpose of the France-Mauritius BIT, we must interpret the term *\"ressortissant\",* as applicable to dual nationals, in context. Under VCLT Article 31(2), the context includes the *text* of the treaty itself, including its preamble and annexes. Interpreting treaty text in context means, of necessity, *examining the relevant provisions of the BIT in which the term to be interpreted is used.*\n\n174.\n\nTurning back to the France-Mauritius BIT, the term *\"ressortissant\"* is used beyond Article 1(2). Most important to the interpretation issue before the Tribunal, which goes to arbitral jurisdiction, Article 9 of the BIT also uses the term *\"ressortissant\".* Article 9 directs all French and Mauritian *\"ressortissants\"* who enter into investment contracts with the other state to arbitrate disputes with the host state under the ICSID Convention. The text of Article 9 bears quoting again, in French and English:\n\n*Les accords relatifs aux investissements a effectuer sur le territoire d\u2019un des Etats contractants, par les ressortissants, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou autres personnes morales de l 'autre Etat contractant, comporteront obligatoirement une clause pr\u00e9voyant que les diff\u00e9rends relatifs \u00e1 ces investissements devront \u00e9tre soumis, au cas o\u00fc un accord amiable ne pourrait intervenir \u00e1 bref d\u00e9lai, au Centre international pour le r\u00e9glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements, en vue de leur r\u00e9glement par arbitrage conform\u00e9ment \u00e1 la Convention sur le r\u00e9glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d\u2019autres Etats.*\n\nIn free translation:\n\n*Agreements relating to investments to be made in the territory of one of the Contracting States by nationals, companies or other legal persons of the other Contracting State, must include a clause providing that their disputes relating to these investments shall be submitted, in the event that an amicable agreement cannot be reached within a short period of time, to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, with a view to their settlement by arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States.*\n\n175.\n\nArticle 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, to which Article 9 of the BIT necessarily refers by referencing the ICSID Convention, also uses the term *\"ressortissant\"* in the authentic French version. Indeed, the ICSID Convention includes a definition of the term, which also bears quoting again:\n\n*\"Ressortissant d\u2019un autre Etat contractant \" signifie :*\n\n*(a) toute personne physique qui poss\u00e9de la nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019un Etat contractant autre que l\u2019Etatpartie au diff\u00e9rend a la date a laquelle les parties ont consent\u00ed a soumettre le diff\u00e9rend a la conciliation ou a l\u2019arbitrage ainsi qu'a la date a laquelle la requ\u00e9te a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e... **\u00e1 l\u2019exclusion de toute personne qui, \u00e1 Tune ou d l\u2019autre de ces dates, poss\u00e9de \u00e9galement la nationalit\u00e9 de l\u2019Etat contractant partie au diff\u00e9rend;*** (Emphasis added)\n\nThe English official version reads as follows:\n\n*\"National of another Contracting State \" means:*\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered..., **but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute;***(Emphasis added)\n\n176.\n\nArticle 25(2) expressly and definitively excludes dual nationals from the term *\"ressortissant\"*. The import is clear: there would be no ICSID jurisdiction of any dispute that arises under a hypothetical investment contract between a French-Mauritian dual national and either France or Mauritius.\n\n177.\n\nTo repeat, Article 9 of the BIT and\u2014by explicit reference in Article 9 to the ICSID Convention\u2014Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention are also part of the *context* in which the BIT term *\"ressortissant\"* must be interpreted. Even accepting the Claimant\u2019s position that the general meaning of *\"ressortissant\"* can be equated with the notion of the term \"national\" in French,151 the duty of the Tribunal is to interpret *\"ressortissant\"* according to the ordinary meaning of the term *in the context* of the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal essentially agrees with the Claimant in this respect. If anything, and putting aside the specific context in which the term must be interpreted in the BIT, the notion of *\"ressortissant\"* is in general synonymous with, and in certain circumstances may even be seen to be broader than, the notion of \"national\", not narrower as argued by Mauritius. Consistent with this interpretation, the Respondent in fact recognized at the hearing that the notion of *\"ressortissant\" \"entitled certain individuals who were not nationals of France to diplomatic protection\".* Transcript, p 50, lines 11-15, Dr Heiskanen.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it decisive, in interpreting the term *\"ressortissant\"* in the treaty context, that Article 9 of the BIT makes it an *obligation,* as opposed to an *option,* for the Contracting States to include an ICSID arbitration clause in investment contracts with protected *\"ressortissants\".* This creates a strict and conventional alignment between the notion of *\"ressortissant\"* under the ICSID Convention and under the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot but conclude that, by incorporating a *mandatory* reference to the ICSID Convention in the notion of *\"ressortissant\"* through Article 9 of the BIT, France and Mauritius have implicitly, but necessarily, excluded French-Mauritian dual nationals from the scope of application of the BIT.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges Rawat\u2019s argument seeking to avoid this conclusion. At the hearing, his counsel agreed that had he sought the application of Article 9 with his French nationality in a (hypothetical) investment contract with Mauritius, the mandatory ICSID arbitration clause would have had no effect due to his dual nationality.152 Counsel effectively asked the Tribunal to read Article 9, as applied to dual nationals, out of the BIT and instead focus on the possibility offered by the MFN language in Article 8 of the BIT and Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT to open the effective avenue of UNCITRAL arbitration, which poses no express jurisdictional bar to dual nationals.\n\nTranscript, p 115, lines 21-25, Dr Pinna.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal carefully examined this argument, but finds that it cannot succeed. Taken to its logical conclusion, the result would be two different meanings being ascribed to the same term in the same treaty. The term *\"ressortissant\"* would be read to include dual nationals in all provisions of the BIT except Article 9, and to exclude dual nationals in Article 9. There is no room for such an internally conflicting interpretation of the same term in a treaty under VCLT Article 31. That a treaty term must be ascribed the same meaning throughout the treaty is in fact undisputed between the Parties.153\n\nTranscript, p 89, line 23 to p 90 line 9, Dr Pinna, referring to the fact that the term *\"ressortissanf'* has *\"exactly the same meaning\"* throughout the France-Mauritius BIT.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* is confirmed by application of the principle of *effet utile,* which the Parties agreed (in response to our fourth written question), is part of the applicable interpretive principles. *Effet utile,* although not expressly set out in the VCLT, is generally accepted to flow from the principle of interpretation of treaties in good faith as envisioned in VLCT Article 31(1). The *Cemex v Venezuela* tribunal described the principle of *effet utile as* \"exclud[ing] *interpretations which would render the text meaningless, when a meaningful interpretation is possible\".*154 We consider that it would indeed be meaningless here to interpret Article 9 of the BIT as obliging France and Mauritius to enter into investment agreements containing ICSID arbitration clauses with *\"ressortissants\"* of the other state who are French-Mauritian dual nationals, when such arbitration clauses would be ineffective precisely because of that dual nationality.\n\n*CEMEX,* supra note 53, para 114.\n\n183.\n\nTo conclude, having found that the term *\"ressortissant\"* cannot encompass dual nationals when interpreted in the context of the France-Mauritius BIT, the Tribunal holds that the BIT does not apply to Rawat as a dual national of Mauritius and France. The Claimant is neither protected under Article 1(2) of the BIT nor under the BIT as a whole, and Mauritius has not consented in the BIT to arbitrate with him.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore upholds Mauritius\u2019 objection to jurisdiction *ratione personae,* as formulated at paragraphs 70-72 of Mauritius\u2019 Memorial on Jurisdiction, and subsequently addressed by the Parties and the Tribunal at the hearing, with the effect that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the claims made.\n\n***ii. Step 2: Does the MFN Clause in Article 8 of the BIT Apply?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nAs a result of the Tribunal\u2019s decision that personal jurisdiction is lacking, we need not advance to the second step and examine whether the Claimant may benefit from the MFN avenue in Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT. Because dual nationals are not covered by the BIT, the Claimant cannot avail himself of the substantive protections of the BIT, including Article 8.\n\n186.\n\nWe do wish to express our appreciation for the high quality of both Parties\u2019 submissions on the jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* objection, which to our knowledge involved an issue of first impression in investment treaty arbitration.155 As the Tribunal pointed out in its Interim Measures Order (paragraph 84):\n\n*counsel for the Parties have been unable to point the Tribunal to any decision in which an investment tribunal tasked with interpreting a BIT without any direct investor-state arbitration clause has found jurisdiction on the basis of an MFN clause in the base treaty, thereby allowing an investor effectively to accept an arbitration offer made by the host state to investors of a third state.*\n\nThe *Menzies* v *Senegal* case, supra note 49, though similar in some respects, is different in that the treaty, including the MFN clause, that the claimants sought to rely on\u2014the GATS\u2014was not an investment treaty.\n\n187.\n\nIf it had proven necessary to decide the Respondent\u2019s second jurisdictional objection, the questions to be resolved would have included defining for MFN purposes the *\"mati\u00e9re\"* in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT and the *\"mati\u00e9re \"* in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT, and deciding whether these were of the same kind. This would have been the heart of the *ejusdem generis* test to be applied and would have involved an assessment of the level of granularity156 at which the *\"mati\u00e9res\"* needed to be considered, in order to distinguish \"matters\" from \"treatment\" of these matters in the respective Articles 9 of the two investment treaties. \"Matters\" cannot be \"bettered\" by virtue of MFN clauses; \"treatment\" of matters may, in accordance with the wording of each relevant MFN clause. It was such questions that the Tribunal highlighted in its Order on Interim Measures (paragraph 81).\n\nBy this, the Tribunal means for instance that \"dispute settlement\" is less granular as a *\"mati\u00e9re\"* than \"investor-state dispute settlement\", which is itself less granular than \"contractual investor-state dispute settlement\".\n\n**C. Costs**\n------------\n\n188.\n\nTo recall, on 5 March 2018, the Tribunal requested statements of costs from each Party by 19 March 2018, *\"including both their arbitration costs and their legal fees and expenses **through** the jurisdictional objection phase\"* (emphasis added).\n\n189.\n\nIn its 19 March 2018 Statement of Costs, counsel for Rawat reported his total costs and fees, as of 31 July 2017 (the date of Mauritius\u2019 Memorial on Jurisdiction), to be \u20ac 277,523.66, including: arbitration costs of \u20ac 100,000 deposited with the PCA, legal fees of \u20ac 172,056.69 of De Gaulle Fleurance & Associ\u00e9s for 685 hours, and expenses of \u20ac 5,466.97. The Statement indicated that *\"Claimant understands that the Statement of Costs shall be limited to the jurisdictional objection phase only\".*\n\n190.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s Cost Statement, also filed on 19 March 2018, counsel for Mauritius reported its total costs and fees, from the date of receipt of the Notice of Arbitration through the jurisdictional objection phase, to be US$ 723,973.53. In addition to Mauritius\u2019 deposits of \u20ac 100,000 and \u20ac 50,000 to the PCA for arbitration costs, counsel divided legal fees and expenses between five phases, as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Phase** | **Legal Fees to Lalive** | **Expenses** |\n| Initial Phase | $ 193,315.70 (464.54 hours) | $ 5,204.30 |\n| Interim Measures | $ 179,262.70 (524.66 hours) | $ 6,644.98 |\n| Memorial on Jurisdiction | $ 158,369.60 (471.30 hours) | $ 5,223.14 |\n| Hearing on Jurisdiction | $ 152,459.70 (419.58 hours) | $ 12,882.41 (counsel) $6,491.00 (client) |\n| Cost Statement | $ 4,000.00 (10 hours) | $ 120.00 |\n\n191.\n\nIn its Statement of Account of 27 March 2018, the PCA Secretariat confirmed that:\n\n(1) each Party had deposited \u20ac 150,000 as advances on costs, bringing the total advance on costs to \u20ac 300,000; (2) the PCA incurred fees, expenses and other bank, printing and telecommunications costs of \u20ac 4,886.76; and (3) the total fees and expenses of the Tribunal were \u20ac 295,113.24. (This reflects reductions taken by the Tribunal members and the PCA to keep the total owing for fees and expenses to the deposited \u20ac 300,000.) The PCA\u2019s Statement of Account is annexed to this Award.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal sets the arbitration costs at \u20ac 300,000.\n\n193.\n\nOn the basis that neither Party prevailed on its request for interim measures, and that both Parties presented strong arguments on complex jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal determines that each Party should bear one-half of the total arbitration costs of \u20ac 300,000. As Rawat and Mauritius each deposited \u20ac 150,000 as advances on costs with the PCA, no further action is necessary with respect to arbitration costs.\n\n194.\n\nOn the basis that neither Party prevailed on its request for interim measures, and that Mauritius prevailed on one of its two jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal (by majority) determines that Rawat shall bear one-third of Mauritius\u2019 total fees and expenses for the jurisdictional objection phase. Using the amounts set out in the Respondent\u2019s Costs Statement for the Memorial and Hearing on Jurisdiction phases, this comes to US$ 111,697.00 ($163,592.74 plus $171,833.11 equals $ 335,425.85, multiplied by 33.3%, equals $111,696.81). Payment is to be made within 45 days of the date of this Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n**VII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n195.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following award:\n\n(1) The Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection to jurisdiction *ratione personae* is upheld;\n\n(2) The Tribunal therefore decides that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims made;\n\n(3) Each of the Parties is to bear one-half of the total arbitration costs of \u20ac 300,000, as confirmed by the PCA Secretariat, and its own legal fees and expenses through the interim measures phase; no reimbursement therefore needs to be made in this respect; and\n\n(4) The Claimant is to pay the Respondent US $ 111,697.00 within 45 days of the date of this Award on Jurisdiction."}]}
