PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 24 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, to which a provisional timetable for the arbitration was attached as Annex A (the \"**Procedural Calendar**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 11 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, whereby it set out a revised Procedural Calendar with the final dates of three possible scenarios for procedural timetables: *(a)* Scenario 1, applicable in the event that any objections to jurisdiction were made with the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, and there was no request for bifurcation; *(b)* Scenario 2, applicable in the event that objections to jurisdiction were made in response to the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits and there was a request for bifurcation, which was granted; and *(c)* Scenario 3, applicable in the event that objections to jurisdiction were made in response to the Memorial on the Merits and there was a request for bifurcation, which was denied.\n\n3.\n\nOn 7 October 2019, the Claimant filed a Memorial on Merits and Damages dated 6 October 2019, together with supporting documentation.\n\n4.\n\nOn 15 November 2019, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation, together with supporting documentation (\"**Request for Bifurcation**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 23 December 2019, the Claimant filed Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation (\"**Observations on Bifurcation**\").\n\n6.\n\nThis Procedural Order sets out the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Request for Bifurcation.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to hear its jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase, and also to bifurcate any merits proceedings into separate phases for liability and quantum.1\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 60.\n\n8.\n\n*First,* according to the Respondent, Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1), (3) and (4), and Article 829 of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (the \"**FTA**\") grant the Tribunal the discretionary authority to decide jurisdictional issues as a preliminary question, separate from the merits, and to further bifurcate the merits into liability and quantum phases.2 The Respondent also argues that it is standard practice for ICSID tribunals to decide jurisdictional and admissibility objections separately from the merits of the dispute.3\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 7, 12.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 6.\n\n9.\n\n*Second,* the Respondent raises two sets of objections to jurisdiction that can be briefly summarized as follows.\n\n10.\n\n**Objection A** :4 The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimant failed to comply with several of the conditions precedent set out in Article 821 of the FTA, which are necessary to submit the dispute to arbitration.5 In particular,6 the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration includes complaints about certain measures for which *(i)* the Claimant did not previously deliver a notice of intent stating the legal and factual basis for such claims (Article 821(2)(c)(iii)), although it did provide a notice of intent addressing claims about other measures;7 and *(ii)* the Claimant did not comply with the mandatory six-month cooling-off period with respect to the same measures (Article 821(2)(b) and (c)).8 The Respondent also contends that *(iii)* the Claimant did not comply with the FTA's mandatory time limitations, by submitting claims for which more than 39 months had elapsed since it \"first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that [it] has incurred loss or damage thereby\" (Article 821(2)(e)(i)).9\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00a7 III.A.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent suggests that it may also have intended to raise a \"condition precedent\" objection that the Claimant failed to comply with the FTA\u2019s waiver requirements, but the Respondent did not return to this issue again elsewhere in its Request, and the Claimant accordingly did not brief the issue either.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 21-27 (arguing that the dispute submitted by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration concerns additional measures beyond those included in the Notice of Intent, specifically (a) Judgment SU-133 of the Colombian Constitutional Court, dated 28 February 2017, and (b) the alleged imposition of fines and the failure to timely issue environmental permits in connection to the Segovia project).\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 28-31.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 32-38.\n\n11.\n\n**Objection B** :10 The Respondent contends that pursuant to Article 814(2) of the FTA, it was entitled to deny the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant and did, in fact, properly deny such benefits on 31 May 2018.11 This denial of benefits was made on the basis that the Claimant purportedly was owned and controlled by investors of a non-Party to the FTA *(i.e.,* not by Canadian nationals), and does not have substantial business activities in Canada.12\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00a7 III.B.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47; Exhibit R-1.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 47-52 (arguing that the Claimant in fact was controlled by two Venezuelan nationals, and the limited activities that the Claimant carries out in Canada do not meet the FTA\u2019s requirement of \"substantial business activities\").\n\n12.\n\n*Third,* the Respondent argues that each of these objections to jurisdiction warrants bifurcation.13 For this, Respondent relies on a *\"three-part test\"* set forth in the *Philip Morris* case, involving an assessment of whether the jurisdictional objections at issue *(i)* were *prima facie* serious and substantial, *(ii)* could be examined without prejudging or entering into the merits, and *(iii)* if successful, disposed of all or an essential part of the claims.14 According to the Respondent, these three criteria are all met in this case. In addition, the Respondent argues that bifurcation here would be consonant with the principles of procedural economy and efficiency, as it \"avoids the expense... of having to prepare extensive submissions, gather evidence and develop complex legal arguments to address the merits of a dispute over which a tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\"15 It further argues that if only one jurisdictional objection warrants bifurcation, the Tribunal can also decide to consider all the remaining jurisdictional objections in the bifurcated jurisdictional stage.16 The Respondent considers that, in light of these factors, its two sets of objections to jurisdiction must be heard as a preliminary question, separate from the merits of the dispute.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00a7\u00a7 III.A.2 and III.B.2.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 13 (citing *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia,* UNCITRAL, PCA\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 10.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 16.\n\n13.\n\nIn particular, with respect to its \"**Objection A**\" regarding conditions precedent,17 the Respondent states that this is *prima facie* serious and substantial since these conditions are necessary to establish the parties\u2019 consent to arbitration under the FTA.18 Moreover, in deciding on the objection, the Tribunal would be required to review only a discrete, selfcontained set of facts, without prejudging the merits of the case.19 Finally, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the objection is capable of disposing of the entire case, because it means that the Parties have not perfected their consent to submit this dispute to arbitration under the FTA.20\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00a7 III.A.2.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 40.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 44.\n\n14.\n\nSimilarly, with respect to its \"**Objection B**\" regarding denial of benefits,21 the Respondent submits *first* that there is credible evidence that supports the objection, making it serious and substantial.22*Second,* in deciding on the objection, the Tribunal would only have to decide on a distinct and discrete factual scenario, without prejudging the merits of the dispute.23*Third,* if the Tribunal decides that the Respondent has properly denied the Claimant the benefits of the FTA, including the possibility of submitting the dispute to arbitration, then the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction and would be required to dispose of the entire case.24\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00a7 III.B.2.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 54.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 55.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 56.\n\n15.\n\n*Finally,* the Respondent also submits that the merits of the dispute should be bifurcated between a liability and a quantum phase, due to the complexity of the case at hand. It submits that the case is based on a complex fact pattern that gives rise to entirely distinct and separate claims. Accordingly, such a complex fact pattern makes it impossible to accurately calculate the amount of damages, an exercise that moreover would be futile if the Tribunal finds no liability. Thus, the principles of efficiency and judicial economy would warrant this further bifurcation.25\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 57-59 (citing *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v.

Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent has not met its burden of proof and, therefore, the Request for Bifurcation should be denied.26\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 68.\n\n17.\n\n*First,* the Claimant argues that the Tribunal should determine whether bifurcation would serve the principle of \"procedural economy and fairness\" and whether the requesting Party has demonstrated this *prima facie.27* It agrees with the three-part test set forth in *Philip Morris,28* but argues that the Respondent misstates the applicable standard.29 The Claimant submits that, under the proper standard: *(i)* the objection must be sufficiently serious and substantial so as to justify bifurcation; *(ii)* it must not raise questions of fact or law that bear on Claimant\u2019s claims on the merits; and *(iii)* the Tribunal must be convinced that, if successful, the objection would substantially reduce the scope of issues before the Tribunal at the merits phase.30\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 3 (citing *Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Procedural Order No. 2, Decision on Bifurcation, 28 June 2018 (CL-161), \u00b6 50 (\"***Eco Oro\"**)).*\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 15-16 (citing *Eco Oro,* \u00b6 49; *Philip Morris,* \u00b6 109).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 5 and \u00a7 I(A).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 15.\n\n18.\n\n*Second,* the Claimant argues that, as the moving party, the Respondent has the burden of proof to demonstrate all the required elements of the test.31 However, the Respondent has not done so.32\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 16 (citing *Azurix Corp. v. Republic of Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 1 September 2009 (CL-164), \u00b6 215; *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd (AAPL) v. Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990 (CL-70), \u00b6 56).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 18.\n\n19.\n\n*Third,* the Claimant addresses the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent and argues that the Respondent has failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to every objection.33 First, with respect to \"**Objection A**,\"34 the Claimant argues that it has complied with the conditions precedent set out in Article 821 of the FTA, as follows:\n\na. **Concerning the legal and factual basis for the claim**.35 The Claimant argues that its Notice of Intent satisfied the requirements under Article 821 of the FTA and states that the Respondent has certified such compliance.36 Further, it argues that such objection does not warrant bifurcation. *First*, the objection is not *prima facie* serious or substantial because the Respondent was sufficiently notified in the Notice of Intent about all of the claims which are the subject-matter of the dispute and, in any case, the measures identified by the Respondent post-dated the Notice of Intent and were simply continuations of earlier measures.37*Second,* a dispute on the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the alleged breaches would require the Tribunal to rule on facts and questions related to the merits.38*Third,* exclusion of the alleged un-noticed fact patterns from the merits would not substantially reduce the scope of issues to be determined at the merits stage.39\n\nb. **Regarding compliance with the mandatory six-month cooling-off period**.40 The Claimant rejects this objection and argues that it does not warrant bifurcation.41*First,* it asserts that the objection is meritless and constitutes a reformulation of the first objection with respect to continuing measures and events that postdate the Notice of Intent and that deal with the same subject-matter as those measures included in the Notice of Intent.42*Second,* deciding this objection likewise would require the Tribunal to decide on facts and questions related to the merits of the case.43*Third,* even should the objection be successful, it would not substantially reduce the scope of issues to be determined at the merits phase.44\n\nc. **Concerning compliance with the FTA\u2019s mandatory time limitations**.45 The Claimant argues that this objection does not satisfy any of the three factors of the applicable test.46*First,* the objection is not serious inasmuch as it is based on misrepresentations by the Respondent of the facts on which the Claimant\u2019s claims are made, and in particular about which measures the Claimant actually challenges in this case, which all post-date the \"critical date\" for purposes of any time bar.47*Second*, to resolve this objection, the Tribunal would have to enter into the merits of the case during the preliminary jurisdictional phase.48*Third,* even if the objection is successful, the objection would not significantly affect the Claimant\u2019s claims on liability and damages, and would not dispose of the entire case.49\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 19.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00a7 II.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00a7 II(A).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 20 (citing the Correspondence and the Minutes of the April 2017 Meeting between Gran Colombia Gold Corp. and the Republic of Colombia following Gran Colombia Gold Corp.\u2019s Notice of Intent, 25 October 2016 - August 2017 (C-9), pp. 4, 30).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 21-28.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 29.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 30.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00a7 II(B).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 31.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b632-35.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 36.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 36.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00a7 II(C).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 38.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 39-49.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 52.\n\n20.\n\nSimilarly, with respect to the Respondent\u2019s \"**Objection B**\" regarding denial of benefits,50 the Claimant argues that this is not properly a jurisdictional objection but an objection on the merits, making it unsuitable for bifurcation.51 However, even if it could be resolved in a preliminary phase, the Respondent\u2019s purported denial of benefits in this case postdated the Claimant\u2019s filing of its Request for Arbitration with ICSID, and there is no basis for giving it retroactive effect so as to vitiate an acceptance already made of the Respondent\u2019s prior offer to arbitrate.52 Moreover, the Respondent bears the burden of establishing the proper grounds for a denial of benefit, which it has not done.53 As a result, this objection does not fulfill the required elements for bifurcation54 because it could not be *prima facie* serious and substantial without even an attempt to demonstrate the elements required for a denial of benefits.55\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00a7 II(D).\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55-57.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 53.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.\n\n21.\n\n*Finally*, for reasons of \"procedural economy and fairness,\" the Claimant asks the Tribunal to deny the Respondent\u2019s request to separate the quantum phase from the liability phase.56 It argues that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate its alleged likelihood of success on the merits of the case, and therefore a likelihood that quantum will not need to be determined.57 Moreover, the Claimant\u2019s analogy to the *Suez* case is misplaced, because there the decision to bifurcate liability and quantum was adopted after the Tribunal received the Parties\u2019 pleadings on damages, and this case in any event lacks the complexity from a quantum perspective that was involved in the *Suez* case.58\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 61.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 62.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 63-67 (citing *Suez,* \u00b6 272).\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered all of the arguments presented by the Parties. The fact that this Procedural Order may not expressly reference all arguments does not mean that such arguments have not been considered; the Tribunal includes only those points which it considers most relevant for its decision. This Procedural Order sets out the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, which is without prejudice to its eventual decision on the substance of the Respondent\u2019s various jurisdictional objections.\n\n**A. Considerations Relevant to Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to rule on the Request for Bifurcation is embodied in Article 829 of the FTA as well as in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 829(1) of the FTA states that \"[t]he Tribunal shall have the power to rule on preliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility,\" and Article 829(2) states that such objections \"shall be made in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules...\" Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention states that a tribunal \"shall determine\" whether to resolve any jurisdictional objection \"as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute,\" and Rule 41(4) states that a tribunal \"may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute.\"\n\n24.\n\nNotably, however, neither the FTA nor the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules set forth an applicable legal standard for determining the appropriateness of bifurcation. Rather, each of these instruments leaves this decision entirely to the discretion of an arbitral tribunal, exercising its good faith judgment regarding the best interests of the case in light of its particular circumstances.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal of course is aware that in exercising the discretion thus granted, other tribunals have identified certain factors as important to their analysis. This includes, *inter alia*, whether the objection is \"substantial\" and not \"frivolous\"; whether the jurisdictional issue is sufficiently discrete from the factual and legal issues that would need to be heard on the merits, so that it may be resolved without the parties being put to the burden and expense of potentially duplicative presentations; and whether the objection is aimed at only a subset of claims, or has the potential either to dispose of the entire case or to result in a material reduction of scope in the next phase of proceedings. More generally, in addressing the question of procedural efficiency, tribunals consider whether the \"costs and time required of a preliminary proceedings... will be justified in terms of the reduction in costs at the subsequent phase of proceedings.\"59 The Tribunal agrees that these are all highly relevant considerations. In general, the Tribunal accepts that the exercise is one of \"weighing for both sides the benefits of procedural fairness and efficiency against the risks of delay, wasted expense and prejudice.\"60\n\n*Glamis Gold,* \u00b6 12 (RL-3).\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Procedural Order Deciding Bifurcation and Non-Bifurcation, 25 January 2013, \u00b6 10 ***(\"Apotex\"**).*\n\n26.\n\nYet, while the jurisprudence identifies certain relevant considerations, it does not suggest that there is a rigid or mandatory formula regarding the process of *weighing* these considerations. There is no consensus on whether they are to be considered holistically or sequentially (much less in what sequence); whether any particular factor is mandatory; or whether certain factors should be weighted more heavily than others for purposes of reaching an eventual result. Given the absence of standards in the governing instruments, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that no \"one-size-fits-all\" analytical structure be imposed on the reasoning process, leaving each tribunal free to consider all factors that it considers relevant in the particular circumstances of its case.61\n\n*See similarly Apotex,* \u00b6 10 (acknowledging that \"[t]here is no bright dividing-line\" in the application of bifurcation factors, and the tribunal must decide the application \"in the particular circumstances of this case. It serves no purpose for this Tribunal to follow blindly what other tribunals have or have not done in other circumstances, particularly with hindsight.\").\n\n27.\n\nCertainly, the Tribunal accepts as a starting point that jurisdictional objections must not be frivolous on their face; it is self-evident that a frivolous objection would not warrant bifurcation and the attendant delay in proceeding to determination of the merits. But this does not mean that every jurisdictional objection that surpasses that low threshold presumptively warrants bifurcation. While the Tribunal appreciates the concern that Parties should not be put to the expense of litigating merits issues if there is a reasonable possibility that a claimant lacks jurisdiction to proceed, the fact remains that the current Arbitration Rules do not build in any presumption of bifurcation, as the prior 1984 version of the Arbitration Rules did.62 The amendment of the Arbitration Rules in 2006 to remove the presumption of bifurcation - which was followed by a similar modification of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules63 - reinforces the broad discretion of tribunals to take all considerations into account in assessing the procedural framework that best serves the overall interests of the case. As noted above, those considerations include appropriate attention to concerns about fairness and efficiency, including whether granting bifurcation on balance is likely to conserve time and resources or to impose additional burdens that otherwise could be minimized or avoided. At the same time, a tribunal always must be guided by its ultimate duty to protect the integrity of proceedings, including its ability to hear all appropriate evidence and to provide meaningful relief. In certain cases, such issues may also factor into the bifurcation analysis.\n\nICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, 25 September 1984, Rule 41(3) (\"Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the proceeding on the merits shall be suspended.\").\n\nCompare UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 1976, Article 21(4) (\"[i]n general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question\") with UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 2010, Article 23(3) (\"The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 2 either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits.\").\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nWhile the Tribunal believes its decision with respect to bifurcation ultimately should be made holistically with an eye towards serving the overall interests of justice in a particular case, it is necessary to make certain brief comments regarding the nature of the particular objections that the Respondent advances here.\n\n29.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considers that the various issues presented as part of the Respondent\u2019s \"**Objection A**\" are unlikely, even if successful, to dispose of all (or perhaps even most) of the issues in the case. In particular, there is no dispute that the Claimant did present a Notice of Intent, which identified a series of actions or omissions about which the Claimant complained.64 There appears likewise to be no dispute that the Claimant observed the required cooling-off period after the Notice of Intent and before its filing of the Request for Arbitration, so this objection does not arise with respect to the actions or omissions that were addressed in the Notice of Intent. The Respondent\u2019s objections rather relate to two *additional* developments that were not referenced in the Notice of Intent, apparently because they postdated it. The question therefore is whether a claimant in these circumstances is required under the FTA to present a second notice, and observe a second cooling-off period, before it may properly include complaints about such later developments in an arbitration that otherwise satisfied the requisite conditions precedent. Regardless of how the Tribunal eventually resolves this question, at most it appears to impact the differential scope of the case, not whether substantial portions of the case will proceed in any event.\n\nNotice of Intent to submit the claim to arbitration with Annexes 1 -6 attached thereto, 10 October 2016 (C-8).\n\n30.\n\nMoreover, resolving these objections may require a greater understanding of the underlying facts, and the interrelationship between various events and measures, than is suitable for accelerated determination in advance of a merits phase. The Claimant has argued that the later developments it seeks to include in this case were (a) simply \"continuations of conduct noticed and preexisting the [Notice of Intent],\" and (b) in any event would be admissible as \"ancillary claims\" under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.65 The latter standards require a determination of whether incidental or additional claims \"aris[e] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute....\"66 Addressing these issues would require the Parties to brief, and the Tribunal eventually to consider, the factual and legal relationship between the events identified in the Notice of Intent and the events that were not. The Tribunal is not convinced that it would be procedurally efficient to examine these factual issues in a preliminary jurisdictional phase, considering that they may well overlap significantly with the factual issues the Tribunal would need to consider anyway in the merits phase which appears likely to proceed (at minimum) with respect to the originally noticed claims.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 34.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention; Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n31.\n\nThe same point applies with respect to the third prong of the Respondent\u2019s \"**Objection A**,\" which concerns application of the limitations period in the FTA. The Respondent says that the Claimant knew or should have known of certain events prior to the \"critical date\" for jurisdiction; the Claimant responds that those prior events are not the ones about which it complains in this case, but rather that its claims of an FTA breach are for State acts or omissions post-dating the critical date. Exploring this objection may well require nuanced assessments about the interrelationship between events occurring before and after the critical date, in order to determine when the Claimant could be said to have first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of various alleged breaches and the incurrence of associated loss or damage. Moreover, even with such a nuanced appreciation of the facts, it is entirely possible that even if the objection succeeds in part (with respect to certain alleged breaches), it would not succeed in full (with respect to other alleged breaches), with the result that significant parts of the case would remain. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not believe that procedural economy would be served by examining these issues in a preliminary phase.\n\n32.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal considers that \"**Objection B**,\" the denial of benefits objection, does not suffer from these two infirmities from the perspective of a bifurcation analysis. *First*, unlike the other objections, this has the potential (if successful) to dispose of the entire case, and not merely some subset either of additional claims (raised after the Notice of Intent) or early breaches (predating the critical date). *Second*, unlike the other objections, the denial of benefits objection is not likely to present factual issues overlapping with the merits. Part of the objection is entirely legal in nature, concerning when a denial of benefits must be declared in order to be effective *(i.e.,* was the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits timely as a matter of law?). While a second part of the objection is factual *(i.e.,* were the FTA\u2019s grounds for denial of benefits met in this case?), the factual issues to be explored are quite limited, revolving around ownership and control of the Claimant and the nature and substantiality of its business activities in Canada. These issues are entirely discrete from - and not intertwined with - the sequence of events underlying the challenged State measures.\n\n33.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Tribunal considers that the grounds for bifurcation would be met with respect to the denial of benefits objection, provided that briefing and resolution of this objection could be accomplished fairly expeditiously, so as not to unduly delay proceeding with the balance of the case if the objection ultimately does not succeed. The Tribunal is mindful that Procedural Order No. 2 provided a presumptive timetable for a bifurcated proceeding, under which the case would not be ready for a hearing on jurisdiction until the first quarter of 2021, while in a non-bifurcated proceeding, the entire case could be ready for a hearing in the last few months of 2021.67 This schedule was predicated, however, on the assumption that there could be multiple bifurcated jurisdictional issues and that some of these could be law- or fact-intensive. For example, Procedural Order No. 2 envisioned 9 weeks for each of the Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 12 weeks thereafter to complete document requests and production, then a further 7 weeks for each of the Reply on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, and then still a further 3 weeks for the Parties to determine which witnesses they wished to cross-examine at the hearing. These periods seem far longer than necessary to prepare the discrete denial of benefits issue for a hearing. Given the narrowness of the issue involved - as well as the Tribunal\u2019s issuance of its Decision on Bifurcation two weeks earlier than originally anticipated in Procedural Order No. 2 - it should be possible with the cooperation of the Parties to accelerate the briefing schedule, in order to achieve a hearing on this single issue later this year.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, Annex A, Scenario 2.\n\n34.\n\nFor example, the Tribunal attaches as Annex A a draft (revised) Procedural Schedule which would enable a 1-3 day jurisdictional hearing (depending if there will be witnesses) to proceed as early as September 2020. The Tribunal also indicates several alternative dates of availability in October, November and early December, if the Parties are unable to accommodate a September 2020 jurisdictional hearing or prefer somewhat more time to develop the denial of benefits issue. The Parties are requested to confer and report jointly in one week as to (1) which of the various alternative hearing dates they wish to reserve, and (b) any requested adjustments to the attached draft (revised) Procedural Schedule leading up to those hearing dates.\n\n35.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal defers for the time being the question of whether, should this case proceed to the merits, there may be sufficient efficiencies to warrant addressing issues of quantum only after a decision on liability is rendered. The Tribunal accepts that in some cases there may be considerable burdens and costs associated with preparing quantum submissions, including the need to develop damages models to address multiple possible scenarios, and that this burden may be exacerbated in cases where challenges are brought to multiple different government acts, and the quantum analysis may differ depending on which (if any) acts eventually are found to violate which (if any) treaty articles. In such cases, a decision to defer quantum submissions may enable the parties to accelerate the liability briefing schedule, while later focusing any quantum submissions on the relevant liability scenario which applies. In other cases, however, the quantum analysis is relatively straightforward, and therefore the added delay occasioned by deferring quantum until after liability is resolved is not justified. The Tribunal acknowledges the Parties\u2019 different views of which type of case this one is, based on the pleadings thus far submitted. However, there is no need to resolve the issue at present, given the Tribunal\u2019s decision first to accelerate briefing on a discrete jurisdictional issue. Once that issue is resolved, the Tribunal naturally will consult the Parties further regarding the expeditious scheduling of the remaining stages (if any) of the proceeding, including whether any adjustments may (or may not) be warranted to the basic briefing structure or intervals of time previously provided in Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n36.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. The Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation with respect to the \"**Objection A**\" issues is denied, with such objection preserved and joined to the merits for further proceedings;\n\nb. The Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation with respect to the \"**Objection B**\" issue (denial of benefits) is granted, but on the basis of an accelerated timetable which will enable resolution of this discrete issue as expeditiously as reasonably possible;\n\nc. The Parties are invited to confer promptly with respect to the draft (revised) Procedural Schedule for a discrete jurisdictional phase proposed in Annex A, and to report jointly in one week as to (1) which of the various alternative hearing dates they wish to reserve (on the basis of a presumptive 1-3 day hearing on jurisdiction), and (b) any requested adjustments to the draft (revised) Procedural Schedule leading up to the selected hearing dates.\n\nCase No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014 (RL-14), \u00b6 109 ***(\"Philip***\n\n***Morris\"**)).* The Claimant contends that other tribunals have applied similar criteria for bifurcation analyses. *See* Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 15 (citing, *inter alia,* *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia signed on 21 November 2008 and which entered into force on 15 August 2011 (the \"**FTA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (\"**GCG**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada.\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Colombia (\"**Colombia**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to Colombia's measures and omissions which have allegedly negatively impacted the Claimant's investments in the Colombian gold and silver mining sectors.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Colombia has breached its obligations under *(i)* Article 811 of the Treaty by means of the indirect expropriation of its investments; *(ii)* Article 805 of the Treaty and customary international law concerning the standard of full protection and security; and *(iii)* Article 805 of the Treaty concerning the fair and equitable treatment standard. The Claimant submits that it is entitled to receive compensation for damage caused as a result of the Respondent's violations of the Treaty.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims. Among other jurisdictional objections, the Respondent claims that Colombia has effectively denied the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant pursuant to Article 814(2) of the Treaty (the \"**DoB Objection**\"). The Claimant acknowledges that Colombia purported to deny such benefits, by letter of 31 May 2018, but contends that this was improper and without effect. Additionally, the Claimant submits an ancillary claim under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, alleging that Colombia has breached Article 814(2) of the FTA by means of its unfounded denial of benefits to GCG. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should reject the Claimant's claim, on the basis that the requirements of Rule 40 are not met.\n\n8.\n\nThis Decision sets out the Tribunal's ruling on the Respondent's DoB Objection and upon the admissibility of the Claimant's ancillary claim.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 29 May 2018, ICSID received a request for arbitration from GCG against Colombia (\"**Request for Arbitration**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 2 July 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\"). In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n11.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal was composed (until 5 February 2019) of Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, a national of Italy, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof. Bernard Hanotiau, a national of Belgium, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n13.\n\nOn 31 October 2018, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mrs. Ana Constanza Conover Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, the Claimant filed a proposal for disqualification of Ms. Loretta Malintoppi and the proceeding was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). On 12 December 2018, the Respondent filed observations on the proposal for disqualification. On 21 December 2018, Ms. Malintoppi furnished explanations in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). On 4 January 2019, the Claimant filed additional observations on the proposal for disqualification. On 5 February 2019, following the resignation of arbitrator Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the vacancy on the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, a national of the United States, accepted her appointment as presiding arbitrator, appointed by the Parties in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1). On the same date, the Tribunal was reconstituted. Its members are: Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof. Bernard Hanotiau, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 June 2019, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n17.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 24 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the Parties' agreements on procedural matters and the decisions of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 established, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out a provisional timetable for the arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nOn 11 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning revisions to the procedural calendar applicable to the arbitration.\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 October 2019, the Claimant filed a Memorial on Merits and Damages dated 6 October 2019 (\"**Claimant's Memorial**\"), with a consolidated index of factual exhibits and legal authorities (C-0001 to C-0274 and CL-0001 to CL-0160, respectively). The pleading was also accompanied by five witness statements and two expert reports, as follows: *(i)* Witness Statement of Alejandro Ramirez Echeverry, dated 4 October 2019; *(ii)* Witness Statement of Alessandro Cecchi, dated 4 October 2019, with Annexes A-D; *(iii)* Witness Statement of Gabriel Gaviria, dated 3 October 2019; *(iv)* Witness Statement of Lombardo Paredes Arenas, dated 3 October 2019; *(v)* Witness Statement of Michael M. Davies, dated 3 October 2019; *(vi)* Expert Quantum Report of Jos\u00e9 Alberro, Ph.D., dated 6 October 2019, with Annexes 1-18; and *(vii)* Expert Report of R. Bruce Kennedy, dated 5 October 2019, with Annexes 1-5 and supporting documents BK-0001 to BK-0042.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 November 2019, the Respondent filed a request to address its objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question (\"**Request for Bifurcation**\") accompanied by exhibit R-0001 and legal authorities RL-0001 to RL-0028. On 23 December 2019, the Claimant filed observations on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation accompanied by factual exhibits C-0275 to C-0276 and legal authorities CL-0161 to CL-0183.\n\n21.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3. In its order, the Tribunal decided to hear the Respondent's DoB Objection in a preliminary phase on the basis of an accelerated timetable, and invited the Parties to confer with respect to a proposed schedule for accelerated determination of the bifurcated jurisdictional issue.\n\n22.\n\nBy emails of 25 January 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to the Tribunal's proposed schedule.\n\n23.\n\nOn 6 February 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the DoB Objection would be decided pursuant to the schedule agreed by the Parties, including 28-30 September 2020 as the applicable dates for a hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 13 February 2020, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to adopt certain procedural measures aimed at promoting the efficiency of the proceeding. On 21 February 2020, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant's proposals, together with supporting documentation. On 23 February 2020, the Claimant submitted further observations related to its request of 13 February 2020.\n\n25.\n\nOn 2 March 2020, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Memorial on Jurisdiction**\"), with factual exhibits R-0002 to R-0043 and legal authorities RL-0029 to RL-0046.\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 March 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the Claimant's request of 13 February 2020.\n\n27.\n\nOn 31 March 2020, the Claimant submitted an application for the Tribunal to put into place a confidentiality order. On 6 April 2020, the Respondent submitted observations on the Claimant's application. On 8 April 2020, the Claimant submitted a reply to the Respondent's observations of 6 April 2020. On 8 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the Claimant's application of 31 March 2020.\n\n28.\n\nOn 13 April 2020, the Claimant filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\"), with factual exhibits C-0277 to C-0348 and legal authorities CL-0184 to CL-0202. The pleading was also accompanied by one witness statement and one expert report, as follows: *(i)* Second Witness Statement of Michael M. Davies, dated 10 April 2020; and *(ii)* Expert Report by Neill May of Goodmans LLP, dated 11 April 2020, with supporting documents NM-0001 to NM-0013.\n\n29.\n\nOn 4 May 2020, following exchanges between the Parties, the Parties filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents. On 11 May 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning production of documents.\n\n30.\n\nOn 1 July 2020, the Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdiction, with factual exhibits R-0044 to R-0058 and legal authorities RL-0047 to RL-0052 (\"**Reply on Jurisdiction**\").\n\n31.\n\nOn 31 July 2020, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, with legal authorities CL-0203 to CL-0212 (\"**Rejoinder on Jurisdiction**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, Canada provided written notice of its intention to file a written submission as a non-disputing State Party by 14 August 2020 on questions of interpretation of the Treaty.\n\n33.\n\nOn 7 August 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to hold the hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue remotely by videoconference. On the same date, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' agreement and released 30 September 2020 from the list of hearing dates.\n\n34.\n\nOn 11 August 2020, Canada notified the Parties and the Tribunal that it would exercise its right to attend the hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue, as provided for under Article 827(7) of the Treaty.\n\n35.\n\nOn 14 August 2020, Canada filed a written submission as a non-disputing State Party pursuant to Article 827(2) of the Treaty (\"**Canada's NDP Submission**\").\n\n36.\n\nOn 11 September 2020, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n37.\n\nOn 18 September 2020, the Claimant introduced a new legal authority to the record as CL-0213.\n\n38.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning the organization of the hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue.\n\n39.\n\nA hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue was held remotely through the videoconference platform called Zoom, hosted by FTI Consulting, Inc., on 28 and 29 September 2020 (the \"**Hearing on Jurisdiction**\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing on Jurisdiction:\n\n*Tribunal* :  \nMs. Jean Kalicki President  \nProf. Bernard Hanotiau Co-Arbitrator  \nProf. Brigitte Stern Co-Arbitrator\n\n*Assistant to the President of the Tribunal* :  \nDr. Joel Dahlquist\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :  \nMs. Ana Constanza Conover Blancas Secretary of the Tribunal  \nMs. Marisela V\u00e1zquez Marrero Paralegal  \nMr. Dante Herrera Legal Assistant\n\n*For Claimant* :  \nCounsel  \nMr. John J.

On 13 October 2020, the Parties jointly requested the Tribunal to defer its consideration of El Cogote's NDP Application until after the submission of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on all issues, should the proceedings continue after the present jurisdictional phase. On 30 October 2020, the Tribunal granted the Parties' joint request to defer the decision on El Cogote's NDP Application, on the basis that several of the factors to be considered under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) would be better understood against the backdrop of both Parties' first-round substantive pleadings.\n\n41.\n\nOn 29 October 2020, the Parties submitted agreed corrections to the Hearing transcripts.\n\n42.\n\nOn 23 and 24 October 2020 respectively, the Claimant and the Respondent filed statements of costs. On 30 October 2020, each Party filed observations on the other Party's statements of costs.\n\n**III. PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) dismiss Respondent's objection to jurisdiction on the basis of Article 814(2) of the FTA, (b) declare that Respondent breached Article 814(2) through its purporting to deny benefits in circumstances where the requirements of that Article were not met, (c) proceed to hear the merits of the dispute and (d) reserve its decision on costs for determination in the eventual award.1\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 163.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n... declare that the Respondent validly denied the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA to the Claimant, and, accordingly, to dismiss GCG's claims for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n... dismiss GCG's claim pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA, including for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n... order GCG to pay the Republic of Colombia all costs associated with these proceedings, including arbitration costs and all professional fees and disbursement, as well as the fees of the arbitral tribunal, plus interest thereon.2\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 161-163.\n\n**IV. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn this section, the Parties' main arguments with respect to the DoB Objection are presented succinctly. The Tribunal emphasizes that it does not purport to set out all arguments presented, much less all authorities and evidence cited in support of those arguments, and the absence of reference to particular assertions or particular supporting material should not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal has carefully considered all points presented in connection with the DoB Objection.\n\n46.\n\nThe Parties' arguments focus on three main issues: **(1)** the timeliness of Colombia's denial of benefits and the burden of proof; **(2)** the grounds for denial of benefits, namely, **(a)** ownership and control of the Claimant and **(b)** whether the Claimant has substantial business activities in Canada; and **(3)** the admissibility of the Claimant's ancillary claim, which the Claimant frames as a claim for breach of Article 814(2) of the FTA, but which the Respondent characterizes as a claim pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA.\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(1) Timing of Colombia's denial of benefits and burden of proof**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent's DoB Objection is based on Article 814(2) of the Treaty, which provides as follows:\n\n**Article 814: Denial of Benefits**\n\n...\n\nA Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of that investor if investors of a non-Party or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is constituted or organized.\n\n48.\n\nBefore arguing that the conditions of Article 814(2) of the FTA are met, the Respondent addresses two preliminary matters raised by the Claimant: **(a)** whether the denial of benefits was timely, and **(b)** the burden of proving the requirements of Article 814(2) of the Treaty.\n\n**a. Timing of Colombia's denial of benefits**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent claims that, by letter of 31 May 2018,3 it properly denied the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant \u2013 including access to international arbitration \u2013 pursuant to Article 814(2) of the Treaty.4\n\nLetter from the National Agency for the Legal Defense of the State (ANDJE) to Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (L. Paredes Arenas), dated 31 May 2018 (R-0001).\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 13 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 38. According to the Respondent, the reference in Article 814(2) of the FTA to the Contracting Parties\u2019 right to deny \"the benefits of this Chapter [*i.e.,* Chapter Eight]\" necessarily includes, as among the benefits which may be denied, the right to submit a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter Eight of the FTA. *See* Resp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6 3.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the denial of benefits was timely. In this regard, it requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimant's two main arguments to the contrary, namely: *first*, that when Colombia denied the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant, GCG had completed the process of submitting the dispute to arbitration by filing its Request for Arbitration to ICSID on 25 May 2018, and, *second*, that the denial of benefits clause cannot apply retroactively to an arbitration agreement that was already in effect as of 25 May 2018.5\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 14.\n\n51.\n\n***First***, the Respondent claims that, at the time Colombia denied the benefits of the FTA to GCG on 31 May 2018, the Claimant had not yet completed the process of submitting the dispute to ICSID. While the Request for Arbitration was filed electronically on 25 May 2018, Colombia was informed of the filing and received a copy of the Request on 30 May 2018. Moreover, ICSID did not register the case until 2 July 2018 (*i.e.*, 32 days after Colombia's denial of benefits), after having requested certain clarifications and obtained additional documentation from GCG.6\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 15-17 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6 42.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, even assuming, *arguendo*, that the Request for Arbitration was validly filed on 25 May 2018, it still denied the benefits of the FTA to GCG at the earliest possible time, merely one day after it received a copy of the Request for Arbitration. There was no reason for Colombia to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA before then, as it had been engaged in negotiations with GCG and could not be certain that GCG would seek to invoke the benefits of the FTA until receiving GCG's Request for Arbitration.7\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 18 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 38-46.\n\n53.\n\n***Second***, the Respondent claims that nothing in Article 814(2) of the Treaty imposes a specific time limit for Colombia to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight. Among other arguments, the Respondent claims that: ***(i)*** Article 814(2) should be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of its terms (which contain no time limit requirement), pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"); ***(ii)*** unlike other treaties, the FTA does not require the State Party to give prior notification of the denial of benefits, which shows that the State Parties to the FTA actively chose not to include any requirements concerning the timing of the denial of benefits; ***(iii)*** the decisions the Claimant cited in support of its arguments regarding timeliness concern the application of a different treaty and are inapposite; and, in contrast, ***(iv)*** other tribunals have found that there is no justification for imposing any time limits not expressly included in the wording of denial of benefits clauses.8\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 19-31.\n\n54.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that it would be unworkable to impose upon Colombia a requirement to deny the benefits of the FTA prior to the submission of any particular dispute to arbitration, as it could not practically or reasonably be expected to investigate and issue denial of benefits notices to all potential foreign investors who may fall within the scope of Article 814(2). The Respondent further rejects the Claimant's contention that GCG's Notice of Intent implied that it would invoke the benefits of the Treaty. It stresses that the purpose of such notification is the amicable settlement of claims against the State. Also, in this case, there was uncertainty as to whether GCG would resort to arbitration since the Parties extended their negotiation period and the Request for Arbitration was filed several months after the negotiations ended.9\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 26-31 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 46.\n\n55.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertion that a presumption of non-retroactivity of a denial of benefits results from Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent argues that denial of benefits clauses form part of the investment protection offered by host States, essentially as a condition on which any consent is predicated, and therefore the invocation of this condition cannot be characterized as a withdrawal of consent. The Respondent further argues that a general presumption of non-retroactivity based on a provision of the ICSID Convention that concerns only one of many advantages that a State could deny under Article 814(2) would be unreasonable, and the Claimant's argument that Article 28 of the VCLT codifies a presumption of non-retroactivity is unsustainable, since that provision simply delimits the temporal scope of Colombia's obligations, not the Claimant's rights or obligations.10\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 32-36.\n\n**b. Burden of proof**\n----------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Claimant's characterization of the principle *onus probandi incumbit actori*, to support its contention that the Respondent bears the burden of proving the justification in fact and law for the DoB Objection, is simplistic, selective and incomplete as a matter of international law, as it ignores that the Claimant bears the burden to rebut the evidence Colombia presents.11\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 47-58.\n\n57.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent asserts that the decisions on which the Claimant relies expressly refer to both parties' obligation to cooperate in the provision of evidence. Moreover, the ICSID Rules underline the tribunal's discretion to freely assess the evidence presented by the parties.12\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 49-54.\n\n58.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant has a burden to cooperate and assist the Tribunal in establishing the relevant facts, and the Tribunal is free to rely on the evidence provided by the Respondent and to draw adverse inferences from the Claimant's lack of cooperation.13\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6 56-58.\n\n**(2) Grounds for Denial of Benefits**\n--------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nArticle 814(2) of the Treaty grants State Parties the right to deny the advantages of Chapter Eight of the FTA to investors which are owned or controlled by nationals of the denying State Party or of third States, and which have no substantial business activities in their State of incorporation. As summarized below, the Respondent claims that the grounds for denial of benefits are met in this case since GCG **(a)** is owned or controlled by non-Canadians, and **(b)** has no substantial business activities in Canada, its State of incorporation.14\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 13, 32.\n\n60.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent submits that the requirements of Article 814(2) of the FTA were satisfied in this case at the time GCG claimed the benefits of the Treaty, regardless of whether such date is considered to be 2 July 2018 (the date on which ICSID registered this case), as the Respondent maintains, or 25 May 2018 (the date of GCG's initial filing of its Request for Arbitration), as the Claimant maintains.15\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 33-40.\n\n**a. Ownership and control of the Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent first refers to ***(i)*** the applicable standard, and then proceeds to submit that GCG was neither ***(ii)*** owned by nationals of Canada, nor ***(iii)*** controlled by nationals of Canada, on any of the potentially applicable critical dates.\n\n62.\n\n***First***, with regard to the applicable standard, the Respondent argues that: the requirements of \"ownership\" and \"control\" are alternative requirements;16 such requirements must be assessed by reference to ultimate ownership and control of GCG and not merely to nominal ownership or formal control by virtue of direct shareholding;17 and relevant factors to determine *de facto* control include financial interest in the investment, the ability to exercise substantial influence over the investment's management and operation and the selection of board members, and the fact of serving as a consistent driving force behind the company.18\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 42; Resp. Reply, \u00b6 68.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 43.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 45 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\n63.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent considers the Claimant's suggestion that \"ownership\" of the enterprise must be exercised by a single investor to be unsupported by the wording of Article 814(2) of the FTA (which expressly refers to ownership and control exercised by \"investors\"), and incompatible with the Treaty's broad definition of \"enterprise\" in Article 106 and the principle of *effet utile*. The concepts of both ownership and control must be interpreted broadly, the Respondent says, to include indirect and beneficial ownership and indirect and *de facto* control. This is necessary to accord meaning and effectiveness to the underlying purpose of denial of benefits clauses, which exist to safeguard against the use of nationalities of convenience to take advantage of the FTA's protections.19\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 9-12, 42, 46-47 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 69, 78-89, 91, 101.\n\n64.\n\nFurther, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's assessment of control based on Canadian corporate and securities law. Instead, it argues that the existence of control should be assessed on a case-by-case basis (absent a definition of \"control\" in the FTA) and remains a matter of international law and not national law.20\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 94, 116.\n\n65.\n\n***Second***, the Respondent claims that GCG is not owned by nationals of Canada. It argues that, at the time GCG claimed the benefits of the Treaty, Canadian nationals did not own the majority of GCG's shares. The Respondent bases its analysis of GCG's ownership on public corporate documents issued prior to 25 May and 2 July 2018.21\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 48-59.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, while GCG did not have any individual shareholders who owned shares carrying more than 10% of the attached voting rights as of 4 May 2018, publicly available information establishes that \"almost all of GCG's publicly known shareholders were not Canadian nationals.\"22 The Respondent's evidence in this regard includes:23\n\na Management Information Circular of GCG dated 4 May 2018, which identifies six shareholders, each holding between 0,001% and 3.89% of shares in GCG;\n\nan Alternative Monthly Report of GCG dated 5 June 2018, which shows that GCG's shareholding structure remained largely the same between 25 May and 2 July 2018;\n\npublicly available sources demonstrating that the six shareholders identified are nationals or companies incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, Colombia, Cuba, Italy, the United States of America, and Venezuela, and do not appear to be Canadian nationals; and\n\nreports from the Canadian System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders which identify other GCG shareholders that are not Canadian.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 51-54 (referring, *inter alia,* to GCG\u2019s Management Information Circular, 4 May 2018 (R-0011) (\"**GCG\u2019s Management Information Circular**\") and GCG, Alternative Monthly Report, 5 June 2018 (R-0012), pp. 1-2).\n\n67.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's reliance on shareholding information which post-dates 2 July 2018, deeming this irrelevant for purposes of the DoB Objection.24 It further opposes the Claimant's assertion that, as of 30 May 2018, 99,632% of GCG's shares were registered in the name of a Canadian securities depository. It considers that the Claimant's argument fails because it focuses on direct (formal) ownership as opposed to beneficial ownership. In this case, it is undisputed that GCG has a myriad of beneficial owners.25\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 56.\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 100-107.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that GCG had 11 known shareholders as of 25 May and 2 July 2018, out of which 9 were nationals of Colombia or a third State and held at least 11,731% of GCG's outstanding shares. Beyond such information, which is publicly available, GCG has not provided a more detailed breakdown of the nationality of its beneficial shareholders as of the relevant dates. In other words, GCG has failed to rebut Respondent's *prima facie* case regarding beneficial ownership made on the available evidence. Therefore, according to the available evidence, the Tribunal should find that GCG was not owned by Canadian nationals at the time it invoked the benefits of the FTA.26\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 57-58 and Table 1; Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 98, 105, 111, 114.\n\n69.\n\n***Third***, the Respondent claims that GCG is not controlled by nationals of Canada. Instead, the Claimant is controlled by GCG's two founders, Messrs. Iacono (an Italian citizen who obtained Colombian nationality in 2010) and de la Campa (a citizen of Venezuela and Cuba, who likewise obtained Colombian nationality in 2010).27\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 60-91 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6 122.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa founded GCG in 2010 through a so-called \"**Reverse Takeover**,\" which allowed GCG's predecessor, Gran Colombia Gold S.A. (\"**GCG Panama**\"), a Panamanian entity, to take over Tapestry Resources Corp.'s (\"**Tapestry**\") corporate position as a Canadian public company.28 The Respondent adds that GCG Panama's registry office was in Colombia and its business activity had a primary emphasis on Colombia, while Tapestry served as a shell company for GCG Panama's Colombian activities.29\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 5, 62-63, 65, 89 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6 124.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 64 (citing Tapestry Resources Corp., Filing Statement, 12 August 2010 (R-0034)) and 66.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa control the Claimant based, *inter alia*, on the following: they exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of GCG in their capacity of directors of the company (and their ability to control GCG is recognized in GCG's corporate documents); Mr. Iacono is \"the public face of GCG,\" regularly referenced in the company's press statements in his capacity as its Co-Chairman; and Mr. Iacono has publicly acknowledged that he and Mr. de la Campa share a working relationship with members of GCG's management far beyond GCG's lifespan.30\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 67-70 (citing GCG\u2019s Management Information Circular, p. 19) and Resp. Reply, \u00b6 122.\n\n72.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent relies on GCG's documents to assert that at the time GCG invoked the benefits of the FTA, there was no Canadian majority in GCG's Board of Directors.31\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n73.\n\nFinally, the Respondent criticizes the Claimant's lack of cooperation in establishing the relevant facts concerning the precise role of Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa within GCG, as well as its lack of an alternative case as to whom controls GCG.32\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 116, 118-120.\n\n**b. Claimant's business activities in Canada**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent first refers to ***(i)*** the applicable legal standard, and then submits that ***(ii)*** GCG does not have substantial business activities in Canada.\n\n75.\n\n***First***, the Respondent argues that the phrase \"substantial business activities\" implies that the investor must not be a shell company. Instead, its activities should go beyond the normal functions required merely by the fact of its corporate existence. Tribunals should therefore focus on \"the genuineness of the business,\" that is, whether the activities in the home State are both real and \"material.\" In conducting this materiality analysis, the Respondent contends, tribunals must take into account the nature of the business at issue, and assess the existence of substantial activities on a case-by-case basis.33\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 78-80 and Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\n76.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 814(2) of the FTA, the company not only must have substantial activities, but must locate those substantial activities in the territory where the enterprise is organized.34 In considering the *locus* of a company's substantial activities, the Respondent contends, it is important to distinguish mining enterprises (which is what GCG publicly contends it is) from investment or holding companies, which were at issue in the cases on which the Claimant relies, and which the Respondent for that reason considers inapposite.35\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 135.\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 133.\n\n77.\n\n***Second***, the Respondent claims that GCG did not have any substantial business activities in Canada at the time it invoked the benefits of the Treaty. It argues that: GCG's public filings state that substantially all of its assets are located outside of Canada; GCG's documents confirm that it has a primary emphasis on acquiring and developing properties in Colombia, with no identified projects in Canada; GCG's directors and management appear to be located outside of Canada; GCG had an insignificant number of employees in Canada (less than 10, in contrast to more than 2,000 in Colombia); and GCG does not appear to undertake any material or recurrent activities at either its head office (where the entrance does not have GCG's name, logo or any other signs of corporate activity) or its registered office (where GCG's name does not appear in the list of tenants).36\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 81-91.\n\n78.\n\nAs further evidence that GCG did not conduct any substantial activities in Canada, the Respondent mentions that: GCG acknowledged that it undertook mining operations only in countries other than Canada; GCG's key functions in Canada, as identified by the Claimant, relate only to the maintenance of its status as a publicly-traded company and are unrelated to mining activities; GCG's fundraising and investing activities were mainly targeted towards servicing debt, not financing mining operations; and GCG has failed to identify any mining-related premises in Canada.37\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 150-156.\n\n79.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that GCG is an investment management company (as opposed to a gold and silver exploration and development company), and therefore only must demonstrate substantial activities in Canada related to services of investment management. The Respondent finds such argument contrary to GCG's representations to investors and the public. Rather, the Respondent asserts, this is a case brought by a company which regularly described itself as a gold and silver exploration, development and production company but did not undertake any substantial activities in Canada with regard to its core mining business at the time it invoked the benefits of the Treaty.38\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 139-149.\n\n80.\n\nBased on the above, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to rule that Colombia properly invoked the denial of benefits provision of the FTA, and accordingly that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over GCG's claims in this case.\n\n**(3) The Claimant's Ancillary Claim under Article 1101 of the FTA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal to declare that it does not have jurisdiction with regard to the new claim presented for the first time in the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, which the Respondent characterizes as a claim regarding Article 1101 of the FTA.39\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Claimant's new claim must be rejected because: ***(i)*** it is not incidental or additional to the claims contained in GCG's Request for Arbitration or its Memorial, but constitutes an entirely new claim; and ***(ii)*** it does not meet the requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, according to which ancillary claims must be within the scope of the consent of the parties and within the jurisdiction of the Centre. Regarding this latter argument, the Respondent submits that GCG may not invoke Article 1101 of the FTA, because Chapter Eleven of the FTA as a whole concerns investments in financial institutions, which does not apply to GCG. Moreover, the Respondent contends, the provisions of Chapter Eleven of the FTA fall outside the categories of claims that investors of a party may submit to arbitration under Section B of Chapter Eight of the Treaty. To adjudicate claims based on Chapter Eleven of the FTA, the Claimant would have to initiate dispute resolution pursuant to Article 1101(2)(b) of the Treaty.40\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) Timing of Colombia's denial of benefits and burden of proof**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the alleged denial of benefits was untimely and that the Respondent has not met its burden of proof concerning the DoB Objection.\n\n**a. Timing of Colombia's denial of benefits**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Colombia's effort to deny benefits to GCG was untimely based on two main grounds: ***(i)*** consent to ICSID arbitration was perfected prior to Colombia's supposed denial of benefits; and ***(ii)*** the denial of benefits clause cannot operate retroactively.41\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 141-180.\n\n85.\n\n***First***, the Claimant asserts that Colombia's consent was perfected prior to its purported denial of benefits and may not be unilaterally withdrawn.42 The Claimant states that Colombia provided advance consent to the submission of claims to arbitration under Article 823 of the FTA on 15 August 2011 (the date of the FTA's entry into force). GCG in turn gave its consent when it submitted its claim to arbitration on 25 May 2018 (*i.e.*, when its Request for Arbitration was received by the ICSID Secretary-General pursuant to Article 822(4) of the Treaty). Accordingly, consent to ICSID arbitration was perfected on 25 May 2018.43 The Claimant also highlights the interplay between Articles 823(2) and 822(4) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that once consent has been given, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.44 Therefore, since the Respondent purported to deny benefits after consent to ICSID arbitration was perfected, its letter of 31 May 2018 can have no impact on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.45\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 142-161.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 142-144 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 147.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 150-151 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 135.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6 152 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 8.\n\n86.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant also points out that denial of benefits is not included among the conditions to consent set out in Article 821 of the FTA regarding conditions precedent to arbitration and, accordingly, Article 823 of the Treaty does not make the Parties' consent subject to a subsequent denial of benefits.46\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 136-137.\n\n87.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, none of the Respondent's arguments to the contrary has merit.47 For instance, it dismisses the Respondent's assertion that consent was perfected only upon ICSID's registration of the case, based on the clear terms of Article 822(4) of the FTA and the fact that ICSID's screening process of requests for arbitration mean that there is always a delay between the receipt of the request and its registration.48\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 153-180. *See also* Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 147-154.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 154-158.\n\n88.\n\n***Second***, the Claimant argues that nothing in the text, the context or the object of the FTA suggests that the denial of benefits clause may have retroactive effects.49 For instance, Article 814(2) contains no wording to the effect that a denial of benefits has retrospective effects. Regarding context, other provisions of the FTA (including Articles 2114 and 2115) also deal with adjustment of benefits and the mechanisms in those articles are prospective only.50 The Claimant further refers to the general principle of non-retroactivity of treaty provisions codified in Article 28 of the VCLT (and applied in a number of international proceedings) to conclude that the absence of a stated retroactive effect signals an intent for the treaty to apply prospectively.51\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 162-179 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 133-146.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 163, 169-170. *See also* Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 140-142.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 171-174 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 145.\n\n89.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the Treaty imposes no time limit on denial of benefits decisions. GCG argues that \"the real issue is not whether Article 814(2) applies retroactively, but whether *a decision to deny benefits* under the authority of that Article has retroactive effect.\"52\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 146 (emphasis in the original).\n\n90.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant argues that the six months' advance notice period, in the form of a notice of intent, that Article 821(2)(c) of the FTA requires before a claim may be submitted to arbitration, constitutes sufficient time for a State to consider whether denial of benefits is warranted. In the Claimant's view, it also shows the Contracting Parties understood that after submission to ICSID arbitration, the consent given could not be withdrawn. In this case, there was a period of almost one year and a half (16 months) after GCG's Notice of Intent, and before arbitration was commenced, during which Colombia could have denied the benefits of the Treaty to GCG.53 Certainly, the Claimant points out, the terms of the Notice of Intent and of the letter declaring the Parties' negotiations unsuccessful showed no uncertainty regarding GCG's reliance on its rights under the FTA, including the right to resort to arbitration.54\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 176, 179 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 148.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 150-153.\n\n91.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's reliance on cases dealing with treaties lacking equivalent notice provisions is misplaced and that its remaining authorities are inapposite.55\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\n**b. Burden of proof**\n----------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the principle of international law that each party has the burden of proving the facts on which it relies (*onus probandi incumbit actori*) to observe that Colombia, as the State party raising objections to jurisdiction, \"bears the burden of proving the justification in fact and law for its purported denial of benefits.\"56 The Claimant argues that the Respondent has not met such burden of proof.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6 23. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 24-26 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 92.\n\n93.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Claimant addresses the issue of burden of proof as part of its analysis of one of the grounds for denial of benefits (alleged control by non-Canadians), as it considers that there is no evidentiary dispute (only a legal dispute) between the Parties concerning the second requirement of denial of benefits (alleged lack of substantial business activities in Canada).57 In that context, the Claimant relies on the *Apotex* case to distinguish \"between the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence).\"58 It adds that the party on whom the burden rests must present *prima facie* evidence that proves this proposition for the evidential burden to shift. However, in this case, for the reasons identified below, Colombia has not satisfied that threshold.59\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 90.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 91 (citing *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v.

Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93.\n\n94.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refutes the Respondent's suggestion that the relevant evidence is uniquely within GCG's control. It asserts that the legal issue is whether the facts relied upon by Colombia as a basis to deny benefits under the Treaty supported that decision. Therefore, it is incumbent upon Colombia to provide the basis for its attempted denial of benefits in May of 2018.60\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.\n\n**(2) Grounds for Denial of Benefits**\n--------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAs summarized below, the Claimant submits that the DoB Objection should be rejected because Colombia has failed to prove that GCG **(a)** is owned or controlled by non-nationals of Canada and **(b)** has substantial business activities in Canada, its State of incorporation.\n\n96.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant submits that the two requirements of Article 814(2) of the FTA are cumulative and the Respondent therefore must prove both requirements in this case.61 In the Claimant's view, neither of these requirements of Article 814(2) of the FTA was satisfied on the relevant date, regardless of whether such date is considered to be 25 May 2018 (the date of GCG's initial filing of its Request for Arbitration), 31 May 2018 (the date of the Respondent's alleged denial of benefits), or \u2013 as the Respondent maintains \u2013 2 July 2018 (the date on which ICSID registered this case).62\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 65, 71-72.\n\n99.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant refers to the definition of the term \"enterprise\" in Article 106 of the FTA, as \"enterprise\" is the object of the verb \"own or control\" in Article 814(2). It finds that some of the forms of entity mentioned in that definition (*e.g.*, \"sole proprietorship\") are capable of being owned by a single person. According to the ordinary meaning of the terms, owning an enterprise may encompass a situation where an investor owns all of the corporation's shares, whereas controlling an enterprise implies shareholding or contractual rights which accord a decisive power over the company's future.64 Therefore, the Claimant concludes, \"for Colombia to prove that [an] investor of other than Canada 'owns' GCG, it must show that such an investor owns all of Claimant GCG's outstanding shares.\"65 Accordingly, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's allegation that an investor may own an enterprise even if the investor owns only a part of it.66\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 84-87 (citing *B-Mex, LLC and others v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/3, Partial Award, 19 July 2019 (CL-0192), \u00b6\u00b6 200-203).\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 88.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59-64.\n\n100.\n\nConcerning the legal standard applicable to the issue of control, the Claimant argues that: an investor may exercise control through either the legal capacity to control the enterprise or *de facto* control; tribunals have required compelling evidence to support an allegation of *de facto* control; while the content of \"control\" in the Treaty is a matter of international law, the Tribunal may be assisted by Canadian securities law in applying that term to a public Canadian company such as GCG, and such law contains a rebuttable presumption of control where holders may exercise direction over 20% or more of a class of securities; and the reference to \"investors\" in Article 814(2) of the FTA, read jointly with Article 808(2), suggests that control over the enterprise must be exercised in the capacity of an investor (not merely through separate functions as an employee, officer or director).67\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 112-120 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 87.\n\n101.\n\n***Second***, the Claimant submits that no single shareholder owns GCG. However, the owner of substantially all of GCG's shares is Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (\"**CDS**\"), a Canadian company.68 The Claimant refers to the British Columbia Business Corporations Act, which requires corporations to maintain a central securities register listing the owners of shares in companies governed by that Act. Such register shows that, in May 2018, there was no single owner of the entirety of GCG's outstanding shares, and indeed 90 separate owners of shares in GCG, but ownership was dominated by CDS, which owned more than 99% of GCG's outstanding shares. Accordingly, the Claimant argues that pursuant to Canadian law, the legal owner of nearly all of GCG's shares is Canadian.69\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 3, 78, 89, 94 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 15, 73.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 90-94.\n\n102.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant argues that, while Canadian corporate and securities law recognizes the concept of beneficial owners of shares, these are not registered owners of shares. As the Treaty's reference to ownership concerns legal title, beneficial ownership is not pertinent to the question of who holds legal title of the shares.70 In any event, the identity of all of GCG's beneficial owners is not ascertainable, except for a limited class of beneficial owners who have provided permission for their identities to be disclosed (the so-called Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners or \"**NOBOs**\"). Focusing therefore on the limited information that exists concerning the NOBOs, the records show nearly 1,900 beneficial owners, representing about 17% of GCG's outstanding shares as of May 2018, 97% of whom were Canadian residents. Hence, no beneficial owner could be viewed as \"owning\" GCG.71\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 95-97 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 75.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 4, 98-102 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 81.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the Respondent's contention that a majority of GCG's shares were not owned by Canadian nationals on May 2018. It argues in this regard that: Respondent's argument is based on shares beneficially owned by individuals who, in the aggregate, account for less than 12% of GCG's outstanding shares in May 2018; the argument fails as a matter of law because that 12% of shares does not meet the legal threshold of ownership (*i.e.*, ownership of all the outstanding shares of an enterprise); the Respondent *prima facie* fails to identify a non-Canadian who can be said to \"own\" GCG; and the wording of the FTA does not support the Respondent's proposed interpretation that ownership includes indirect and beneficial ownership. Accordingly, the Respondent has failed to prove that investors of a third State owned GCG at the relevant times.72\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 103-108 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 77-78, 93.\n\n104.\n\n***Third***, the Claimant asserts that, at all relevant times, no single shareholder controlled GCG.73 The Claimant notes that CDS owns shares to allow financial intermediaries to participate in the CDS registry system and, in turn, those intermediaries held the shares for a wide share of beneficial owners. The record of this case does not establish any beneficial owner of GCG's shares of any nationality having a controlling interest in GCG (*i.e.*, carrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding common shares). Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa, for instance, collectively controlled only 5.79% of GCG's shares, which does not constitute a controlling interest by any objective standards.74\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 76, 109, 121.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 6, 122-123 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 110-111.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant therefore rejects the Respondent's contentions concerning GCG's alleged control by non-Canadians.75 It argues in this regard that: the Respondent's allegation that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa were the \"public face\" and directors/officers of GCG is legally insufficient to establish the element of control, because directors are elected by (and serve at the pleasure of) the company's shareholders;76 the 2018 Management Information Circular to which the Respondent refers recognizes that, as of the date of that circular, Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa did not hold a controlling combination of shares;77 and the fact that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa are not Canadian does not strip GCG of its Canadian nationality.78 Also, the Respondent's allegation that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa exercise substantial influence over GCG because they have been directors of the company since 2010 fails both as a matter of law and evidence, since the activities the Respondent identifies as demonstrating the extent of their influence are simply within the directors/officers' scope of work.79\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 125-139.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 16, 126 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 118, 120.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 130-132 (referring to Resp. Mem., \u00b6 68 citing GCG\u2019s Management Information Circular, p. 19).\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 127.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 134-135.\n\n106.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant notes that, while it is correct that GCG historically was the result of a reverse takeover, that 2010 transaction is not pertinent to the issue of control in 2018.80 The Claimant also asserts that it is irrelevant whether a majority of GCG's Directors are Canadian, for purposes of determining control. Finally, the Claimant observes that the absence of a controlling beneficial owner in a public Canadian company is not an unusual scenario, nor is it evidence of non-Canadian control.81\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 129 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 119.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 136-137.\n\n**b. Claimant's business activities in Canada**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant first refers to ***(i)*** the applicable legal standard, and then submits that ***(ii)*** GCG has substantial business activities in Canada.\n\n108.\n\n***First***, with regard to the applicable standard, the Claimant argues that, as the Respondent acknowledges, the terms \"substantial business activities\" in Article 814(2) of the FTA imply that the investor must not be a shell company; *a contrario sensu*, the Claimant notes, an enterprise with any business activity of substance may not be denied benefits.82\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\n109.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant relies on prior cases in which tribunals have found that: the \"substantial business activities\" test is met where the record shows at least a relatively small number of activities in terms of quantity and quality (*i.e.*, \"substantial\" relates to the materiality, not the magnitude, of the business activity), and is dependent on the nature of the business; funding sourced through financial markets in the country in which an enterprise is incorporated constitutes proof of a genuine connection to that country; and in one prior case, the tribunal considered that the \"substantial business activities\" test was satisfied by an investor's status as a holding company with substantial international assets under its control.83\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40-43, 66-67 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 46.\n\n110.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent's assertions, no tribunal has ever applied a limitation of \"substantial business activities\" that is focused on the sector of activity performed,84 such that (for example), a company involved in overseas mining activities must also conduct mining in its country of incorporation in order to satisfy the relevant Treaty test.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n\n111.\n\n***Second***, the Claimant submits that it conducts substantial activities in Canada. In this regard, the Claimant mentions, *inter alia*, that GCG has raised over US$500 million in Canada's equity and debt markets over the past decade; pays millions of dollars every year in Canada to Canadians for salaries, goods and services; and conducts some of its most important corporate functions from Canada.85\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 2, 35, 45, 56 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 21.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant states that most of its key functions are performed out of its global headquarters in Toronto (including accounting, shareholding relations, legal and IT support), where it incurs expenses for office space rent, utilities and other costs related to its local activities. The Claimant dismisses the Respondent's photographs of the premises, suggesting that they may depict the entrance in the brief period where renovation works were underway, and presents pictures taken on March and April 2020 which are said to accurately depict GCG's global headquarters since October 2017.86 Moreover, GCG employs eight full-time employees at its global headquarters in Toronto, to whom it paid compensation exceeding CAD$ 1 million in 2018 alone; it incurs expenses for legal services in Canada; and it contracts professional services in Canada on an as-needed basis, including accounting and tax related services. In addition, in or about May 2018, GCG held six bank accounts in Canada with accounts holding assets in excess of US$25,500,000.87\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 50-54 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 21.\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant notes that it raises the financial resources for GCG's global operations on the Canadian capital markets and lists some of its most significant fundraising and investment transactions in Canada. It further notes that these transactions entailed millions spent on professional services from Canadian advisors and bankers, and that all securities issued by GCG trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Moreover, the Claimant stresses that GCG's shareholder and investor relations activities are performed in Canada, including the organization of the annual general and special meetings of GCG's shareholders in Toronto, the publication of official documents, press releases, social media communications, among other activities.88\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 56-62.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's contentions concerning the alleged non-substantial activities of GCG in Canada. Among other arguments, the Claimant submits the following: GCG had material assets in Canada in May 2018, including bank accounts (and even if it did not, it would still meet the \"substantial business activities\" test given its standing as a holding company with substantial international assets); the question of whether GCG's primary emphasis for mining operations in 2018 was Colombia is unrelated to whether GCG nonetheless had substantial business activities in Canada; and Respondent's argument that some of GCG's directors and management appear to be located outside Canada is irrelevant, as the presence of even a small number of full-time employees in Canada is sufficient to establish substantial business activities.89\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 65-75.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, the Claimant considers as legally misplaced the Respondent's observation that GCG did not prove it conducted any mining operations activities in Canada. According to the Claimant, Article 814(2) requires the Respondent to show that GCG has \"no substantial business activities\" in Canada, but does not limit the inquiry about business activities to a particular type or sector of activities.90 Similarly, because the focus of a denial of benefits inquiry is on the activities of the investor (the Canadian entity) on a standalone basis, the activities of other operational companies (*i.e.*, mining operating companies) that GCG owns and controls are not pertinent for the DoB Objection.91\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 17, 23-24, 34-41.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 53.\n\n116.\n\nIn sum, given that the record shows substantial business activities of GCG in Canada, that the Claimant's shares are largely owned by a Canadian company and the fact that it has no controlling investor, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to reject the DoB Objection and resume the proceedings on the merits.92\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 19, 139.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Ancillary Claim under Article 1101 of the FTA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant refers to Article 1101 of Chapter Eleven of the Treaty regarding financial services, which incorporates by reference Section B of Chapter Eight (Investment - Settlement Of Disputes Between An Investor And The Host Party) for claims that a Party has breached, *inter alia*, Article 814 of the FTA regarding denial of benefits.93 The Claimant contends that this reference demonstrates the possibility of bringing a substantive claim under the FTA for alleged breach of Article 814.\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6 183.\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" it therefore presents an incidental claim under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, alleging that Colombia has breached Article 814(2) of the FTA by means of its unfounded denial of benefits to GCG. The Claimant adds that this incidental claim is within the Tribunal's jurisdiction as it arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute and falls within the scope of the Parties' consent.94\n\nCl. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 185-187 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 158-162.\n\n**V. CANADA'S NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nCanada's non-disputing party submission focuses on three main issues: **(1)** general observations concerning Article 814 of the Treaty; **(2)** burden of proof and timing of a denial of benefits under Article 814(2); and **(3)** the grounds for denial of benefits.\n\n120.\n\n***First***, as a preliminary matter, Canada states that Article 814 of the Treaty must be understood by reference to the Contracting Parties' objectives set out in the Treaty's preamble (including the stimulation of mutually beneficial business activity and the strengthening of friendly relations between the Contracting Parties). The denial of benefits provision allows a Contracting Party to deny the benefits of the FTA if the objectives of the Treaty would not be advanced, such as where investors are enterprises with no real economic link or ties with the country in which they are constituted or organized. This prevents enterprises of non-Parties or of the denying Party from gaining access to treaty protection simply through incorporation in the jurisdiction of a Contracting Party.95\n\nCanada\u2019s NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5-9.\n\n121.\n\n***Second***, with regard to burden of proof, Canada submits that a claimant must meet its burden of establishing that it satisfies the definition of \"investor of a Party\" and of \"investment of an investor of a Party\" under Article 838 of the Treaty. If so, then the burden is on the party wishing to invoke the denial of benefits provision to establish that the conditions to deny benefits are met. A tribunal may take into account all evidence before it to determine whether the conditions to deny benefits under the Treaty are met, including evidence submitted by either disputing party. As to the consequences of a proper invocation of Article 814(2), Canada states that the investor of the other Contracting Party will not be entitled to treaty protection and a tribunal will not have jurisdiction over claims of breach of the treaty obligations.96\n\nCanada\u2019s NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 10-14.\n\n122.\n\nConcerning the timing of a denial of benefits, Canada notes that the FTA does not contain any time limitation to invoke the denial of benefits provision, nor any restriction precluding a Contracting Party from invoking this provision after a claim has been submitted to arbitration. It refers to rulings of arbitral tribunals that have invoked a similar absence of any limiting language when interpreting comparable provisions in other agreements, and argues that requiring States to invoke a denial of benefits before a claim is submitted to arbitration would entail an unnecessary and untenable burden on the respondent State. Accordingly, Canada submits that a State's advance consent to arbitrate under the FTA is limited by the denial of benefits provision, and that this provision can be invoked after the submission of a claim.97\n\nCanada\u2019s NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 15-20.\n\n123.\n\n***Third***, Canada addresses the two grounds for denial of benefits, namely ownership or control of the enterprise and whether the enterprise has substantial business activities in the other party in which it is incorporated.\n\n124.\n\nWith respect to \"ownership\" or \"control\" under Article 814(2) of the FTA, Canada notes that neither term is defined in the Treaty. Hence, these terms should be interpreted according to Article 31 of the VCLT. Also, because there is no established definition of those terms under international law, these concepts can derive meaning from domestic corporate law. In Canada's view, ownership of a corporation usually requires at a minimum the ownership of a majority of the voting shares, while control of a corporation is a fact-based inquiry that may extend beyond consideration of share ownership and must be considered on a case-by-case basis.98\n\nCanada\u2019s NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n\n125.\n\nFinally, concerning the existence of substantial business activities under Article 814(2) of the FTA, Canada argues that such determination requires a fact-based analysis, as it will depend on the circumstances of the case and a number of factors. It adds that the materiality of the business activity is the key question to establish whether the enterprise has real business operations creating an economic link to the other Party in which it is incorporated.99\n\nCanada\u2019s NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Timing of Colombia's denial of benefits**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with the uncontroversial proposition that pursuant to VCLT Article 31(1),\u00a0Article 814(2) of the FTA \u2013 like any other treaty provision \u2013 is to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the \"ordinary meaning\" of its terms, in the \"context\" in which they occur and in light of the Treaty's \"object and purpose.\"100 But in assessing the terms of any particular treaty provision, it is relevant to consider not only what they say, but equally what they do not say. Here, Article 814 of the FTA is entirely silent with respect to any time frame within which a Contracting Party may invoke its provisions to deny the benefits of the FTA's Chapter Eight (on \"Investment\") to an enterprise of the other Contracting Party. The only conditions regulating such a denial of benefits are non-temporal in nature, *e.g.*, with respect to Article 814(2), that \"investors of a non-Party or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory\" where it is constituted or organized.\n\nVCLT (CL-0173), Article 31(1).\n\n127.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal would have great difficulty concluding that the FTA implicitly contains an additional (temporal) limitation on the Contracting Parties' exercise of the right they expressly agreed to retain in Article 814, but without stating any such limitation. States are free to grant reciprocal protections to investors through the mechanism of investment treaties, but they are also free to condition such grants on particular qualifying principles. Some such conditions are framed as absolute: for example, that an investor must satisfy stated nationality requirements in order to qualify for treaty benefits. Other conditions may be framed in terms of State discretion, allowing a State Party to choose whether to invoke them, even if the requirements for doing so are met. Article 814 falls in the latter category (\"A Party *may* deny...\"): it permits, but does not require, a State Party to invoke its terms with respect to a given investor and its investments. In confirming that the State Parties thus have a choice with respect to denial of benefits, it would have been easy for the Contracting Parties to specify a deadline by which such choice must be made, in order to limit their mutual exercise of discretion. The fact that the Contracting Parties did not do so must be given considerable weight. In general, it is not for arbitral tribunals, in interpreting the text of investment treaties, to read into such texts additional requirements (either on States or on investors) that the State Parties have not chosen to impose.\n\n128.\n\nIn this case, both the Claimant and the Respondent have offered arguments about the potential *practical consequences* of each other's position with respect to when States may deny FTA benefits to investors under Article 814(2), coupled with *object and purpose* arguments that are predicated on accepting the propositions about practical consequences. For example, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's approach \u2013 requiring any denial of benefits to predate the filing of a request for arbitration \u2013 would impose an impossible burden on States (which they could not have intended to assume) to investigate and monitor, for all investors in their country with whom they have no dispute whatsoever, potentially evolving facts regarding ownership and control or the extent of business activities in their State of incorporation.101 The Claimant responds that its reading would not require any such sweeping monitoring program, because FTA Article 821.2(c) requires any investor wishing to pursue an arbitration claim to provide at least six months' advance notice of its intent to do so, which should provide sufficient time for a State to make any Article 814(2) determinations with regard to that specific investor. For its part, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's approach \u2013 allowing States to deny benefits even after a case has been filed \u2013 would run counter to the FTA's objective of providing investors with predictability about available protections. The Respondent replies that any object and purpose of predictability is ensured by investors understanding, in advance, that they must organize their ownership, control and business activities in such a way as to meet the minimal threshold for avoiding any issue of denial of benefits.\n\nCanada expresses similar concerns in its NDP Submission. *See* Canada\u2019s NDP Submission, \u00b6 17.\n\n129.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is little need to enter into this debate. States have a choice whether to incorporate in their treaties express limits on when any denial of benefits must be invoked. While it may be interesting to debate whether they should do so \u2013 which would involve balancing a number of considerations \u2013 ultimately that is a policy question that is not for tribunals to resolve. Absent any evidence that particular States intended to impose a particular limitation on a right which they granted or reserved in a particular treaty, it is not within a tribunal's remit to impose such an additional limitation.\n\n130.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal declines the Claimant's invitation to conclude that the Contracting Parties to the FTA may invoke Article 814(2) to deny benefits to an investor only up until the date the investor files its request for arbitration.102 As Article 814(2) contains no such temporal restriction, investors operating in Canada and Colombia must understand, *ex ante*, that any protections otherwise offered to them in Chapter Eight of the FTA (which includes both substantive protections and dispute resolution mechanisms) may be subject to their ability to demonstrate that they meet the ownership or control and substantial business activity requirements of that provision. This is little different from understanding, *ex ante*, that they may eventually be called upon to substantiate their claims of qualifying nationality, or their status as *bona fide* investors with qualifying investments, or any other core jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty. Moreover, the fact that the FTA effectively conditions Treaty protection on the Article 814(2) requirements \u2013 although State Parties may choose whether or not to invoke the conditions in a particular case \u2013 does not mean that the Treaty in that respect operates \"retroactively,\" or in contravention of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as the Claimant contends.103 It simply means that by the terms of the FTA itself, investors are placed on notice in advance, from the time the FTA entered into force, that they may face a risk of not being able to rely on the FTA's protections if they choose not to organize their activities in accordance with the standards set forth in Article 814.104\n\n*See* *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012 (RL-0041) (\"***Pac Rim***\"), \u00b6 4.85 (finding that such a limitation \"could not be justified on the wording of CAFTA Article 10.12.2,\" which contained no stated time limit for denial of benefits); *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2011-17, Award, 31 January 2014 (RL-12) (\"***Guaracachi***\"), \u00b6 377 (noting that the Contracting Parties to a US-Bolivia investment treaty \"could have agreed\" to preclude any denial of benefits after initiation of arbitration, but did \"not... do so.\").\n\n*See Pac Rim,*\u00b6 4.90\u00a0(RL-0041) (concluding that a CAFTA Party\u2019s \"consent to ICSID arbitration... is necessarily qualified from the outset by [the denial of benefits clause],\" and accordingly a denial of benefits invoked after an ICSID arbitration commences \"cannot be treated as the unilateral withdrawal of that Party\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration under ICSID Article 25(1)\").\n\n*See Guaracachi,* \u00b6\u00b6 371-372 (RL-0012) (concluding that \"the denial of benefits cannot be equated to the withdrawal of prior arbitral consent.... [T]he consent by the host State to arbitration itself is conditional and thus may be denied by it, provided that certain objective requirements... are fulfilled. All investors are aware of the possibility of such a denial....\"); *Ulysseas, Inc. v. The Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 28 September 2010 (RL-0038), \u00b6\u00b6 173 (noting that \"the possibility for the host State to exercise the right in question is known to the investor from the time when it made its... investment,\" and \"the protection afforded by the BIT\" remains \"subject... to th[at] possibility\").\n\n131.\n\nFinally, while the FTA itself imposes no limitation on when States may invoke Article 814(2), the operative Arbitration Rules may well impose their own limitations. A State's well-grounded denial of benefits has the effect of denying jurisdiction to a claimant seeking to rely on the substantive and dispute resolution provisions of Chapter Eight of the FTA; as such, any objection to jurisdiction must be raised no later than permissible under the applicable Arbitration Rules. In cases governed by the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, the applicable deadline for objecting to jurisdiction on any grounds is the date of a respondent's counter-memorial,105 so that effectively becomes the deadline for any enforceable denial of benefits. In this case, Colombia invoked Article 814(2) much earlier than that \u2013 just one day after its receipt of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration \u2013 so its invocation was timely under the applicable rules.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) (CL-0036).\n\n132.\n\nThe question therefore becomes simply whether Colombia's invocation of Article 814(2) was well-grounded in its substance. The Tribunal turns to that issue below.\n\n**B. Grounds for Denial of Benefits**\n-------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nIt is undisputed that States have the power to agree on the characteristics of investors to whom to extend treaty protection \u2013 and provided their agreement is clear, tribunals are obligated to honor that agreement. Here, the agreement between Canada and Colombia, reflected in Article 814(2) of the FTA, is that either State may deny the benefits of FTA Chapter Eight to an enterprise registered in the other State, if two *cumulative* conditions are met: (a) the enterprise is not owned or controlled by nationals of its home State, and (b) it has no substantial business activities in its home State. An enterprise which is unable to rebut even one of these showings \u2013 *i.e.*, because it is neither owned nor controlled by home State nationals, nor has any substantial business activities in its home State \u2013 cannot assume entitlement to protection by the FTA. That is because the host State retains the right on that basis to deny it the benefits of the Treaty. The enterprise in such circumstances would only be able to claim Treaty benefits if the host State chooses not to exercise its retained (but discretionary) right to deny benefits under Article 814(2).\n\n134.\n\nConversely, the host State has no right to deny benefits to the enterprise if *only one* of Article 814(2)'s two cumulative conditions is met. As a result, an investor need demonstrate only that it satisfies *one* of the relevant criteria, in order to defeat a putative denial of benefits.\n\n135.\n\nAccordingly, in this case, the issue of ownership and control of GCG, as a Canadian registered company, becomes relevant only if GCG has no substantial business activities in Canada \u2013 and equally, the extent of GCG's business activities in Canada becomes relevant only if the company is not owned or controlled by Canadian nationals. That reality simplifies matters to a considerable degree. The Parties have raised interesting issues about ownership and control of GCG, including how such matters are to be determined for a publicly traded company whose shares are nominally owned by the CDS, but on behalf of apparently diffuse beneficial owners whose identity is largely unavailable. The Parties also have debated the extent of any *de facto* control that may be wielded by Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa, and whether it is necessary for that inquiry to distinguish among the various capacities in which they might exert influence, including as company founders, corporate directors, or shareholders. Ultimately, however, the Tribunal need not decide any of these interesting issues, because in any event, GCG satisfies the alternate prong of the Article 814(2) inquiry, by virtue of having \"substantial business activities\" in Canada. The latter conclusion flows both from analysis of the phrase \"any substantial business activities,\" and from the facts that have been demonstrated about GCG's various Canadian activities.\n\n136.\n\nStarting with the treaty text, Article 814(2) permits a denial of benefits if there are \"no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is constituted or organized.\" The word \"no,\" which qualifies \"substantial business activities,\" makes clear that the inquiry is not about whether Canada is the jurisdiction with which GCG might have the *most* substantial connections. Companies may have business activities in many jurisdictions, including both the country in which they are registered and other countries in which they choose to conduct operations. Article 814(2) does not require a comparative analysis, weighing these various activities against each other to determine the single jurisdiction in which the enterprise has its most extensive or dominant connections. It simply requires that a Canadian-registered company have *some* substantial business activity in Canada.\n\n137.\n\nThe next word in the treaty text, \"substantial,\" nonetheless provides an important materiality threshold. A business activity may not be mere cursory, fleeting or incidental, but must be of sufficient extent and meaning as to constitute a genuine connection by the company to its home State. That genuine connection is necessary to ensure that the company is one that the home State has an interest to protect, and which the host State would consider it appropriate for the home State to protect. The connection between the company and its home State cannot be merely a sham, with no business reality whatsoever, other than an objective of maintaining its own corporate existence. That requirement is reinforced by the last words in the treaty text, \"business activities\"; the activities of the company in its State of registration must be of a \"business\" nature. If the company has no activities in its home jurisdiction other than those required to maintain its bare registration, then it is impossible to conclude that it is conducting any \"business\" there, in any real sense of that word.\n\n138.\n\nAt the same time, while the company must have some real, material business activities in its home State, the Treaty contains no limitations on the nature of that business. It certainly does not require that the activities at home be of the *same* nature as those the company conducts in other jurisdictions. Nothing in the Treaty suggests, for example, that a company engaged overseas in natural resource exploration and development must conduct similar resource exploration or development at home, in order to satisfy the requirement of having substantial business activities there. It is entirely consistent with the Treaty text for such a company to locate coordinating or support functions in its home State, or to use its home State as a hub for investment and financing activities that make possible the operational activities in other places. Either way, the activities in the home State must be examined on their own merits \u2013 separate from the activities undertaken in other jurisdictions, including by the company's subsidiaries or affiliates106 \u2013 to determine if they are of sufficient reality and materiality as to satisfy the requirement that there be some \"substantial business activities\" in the country of registration.\n\n*See similarly Pac Rim,*\u00b6 4.66(RL-0041) (noting that the substantial business activities test \"relates not to the collective activities of a group of companies, but to activities attributable to the 'enterprise\u2019 itself.... If that enterprise\u2019s own activities do not reach the level stipulated..., it cannot aggregate to itself the separate activities of other natural or legal persons to increase the level of its own activities: those would not be the enterprise\u2019s activities for the purpose of applying CAFTA Article 10.12.2\").\n\n139.\n\nHere, that requirement is amply satisfied, on any of the dates possibly relevant for the analysis. With respect to those dates, there has been no suggestion that the nature or substantiality of GCG's activities in Canada changed in any way between 25 May 2018 (the date it filed the Request for Arbitration), 31 May 2018 (the date Colombia invoked Article 814(2) to deny FTA benefits), or 2 July 2018 (the date ICSID registered the case). In these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no need to resolve in the abstract which of these dates might be most critical for evaluating the effectiveness of Colombia's denial of benefits. The important point is that for this entire period, the record reflects, *inter alia*, the following activities by GCG in Canada:\n\nCore corporate functions in Toronto : corporate finance, fundraising, accounting, shareholder relations, legal, administration and IT support;107\n\nOffice space : spending over US$100,000 on rent, utilities and related expenses in 2018;108\n\nEight full-time employees in Toronto : In 2018, GCG spent over CAD$1.2 million in Canada on compensation and benefits.109\n\nSeveral bank accounts in Canada : Six bank accounts through which GCG actively conducts its business; in or about May 2018, those six accounts contained more than US$25 million;110\n\nAnnual purchases of goods and services in Canada : GCG has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars related to accounting and advisory services, legal services, and shareholder and investor related activities, as well as miscellaneous services such as IT, liability policies and a listing fee for the Toronto Stock Exchange;111 and\n\nFinancing activities : GCG has raised more than US$500 million over the last 10 years, in transactions on the Canadian debt and equity markets, in order to support its operations.112\n\nCl.

They are undoubtedly \"business\" in nature, even if the business in question in Canada appears \u2013 as the Claimant contends \u2013 to be essentially investment management and financing, to support a different type of business (mining operations) conducted in Colombia by affiliated entities. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Colombia's argument that GCG must show mining activities *within* Canada, simply because its public-facing statements focus on mining activities; as the Claimant reasonably explains, public-facing statements often focus on the collective activities of a corporate group, including overseas activities and not solely home office activities. This does not change the nature of the Treaty inquiry, which is simply whether the Claimant entity \u2013 viewed on its own \u2013 has *any* substantial business activities in Canada, in any business sector.\n\n141.\n\nIn this case, the record shows that GCG does. Its activities in Canada go well beyond that which would be necessary for a \"mailbox\" or \"shell\" company to maintain its corporate form. The Tribunal accordingly has no doubt that these activities (taken together) satisfy the relevant criteria in Article 814(2), in order to render ineffective Colombia's attempted denial of benefits to GCG under the Treaty.\n\n**C. Admissibility of the Claimant's Ancillary Claim**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal notes as a threshold matter that the Parties differ in their characterization of the Claimant's ancillary claim, with the Claimant framing it as one alleging breach of Article 814(2) of the FTA,113 and the Respondent characterizing it as one brought pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA.114 The first step in addressing the admissibility of any ancillary claim is a determination of *what claim in fact has been submitted*.\n\n*See* Cl. Rej., \u00b6 163 (requesting that the Tribunal \"declare that Respondent breached Article 814(2) through its purporting to deny benefits in circumstances where the requirements of that Article were not met\").\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6 162 (requesting that the Tribunal \"dismiss GCG\u2019s claim pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA, including for lack of jurisdiction\").\n\n143.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is generally for the party submitting a claim to articulate what claim it actually is pursuing. To the extent there was any ambiguity on this score in the Claimant's Counter-Memorial,115 the Claimant has now clarified its intention in its Rejoinder, stating that \"the claim presented is not one under Chapter Eleven of the FTA, the financial services chapter.... [T]he claim is one under Chapter Eight for breach of Article 814(2).\"116 The Tribunal has no basis for disregarding this framing of the claim. Indeed, it would be nonsensical to decide a proposition about the admissibility of a claim, while ignoring the Claimant's clarifications about what that claim actually is.\n\n*See* Cl. C-Mem., \u00b6 183 (stating that \"GCG has observed that the Treaty itself contemplates an additional approach to qualifying an unfounded denial of benefits,\" and citing Article 1101 of the FTA as \"incorporat[ing] into [Chapter Eleven] by reference selected portions of the investment chapter (Chapter Eight),\" including \"for claims that a party has breached Article []... 814 (Investment - Denial of Benefits\"); *id.*, \u00b6 184 (\"[t]he Treaty thus contemplates that an appropriate remedy for a Party\u2019s unfounded invocation of the denial-of-benefits provision is a claim by the investor for breach of Article 814\"); *id*., \u00b6 186 (\"GCG therefore presents an incidental claim that Colombia has breached Article 814(2) through its unfounded denial of benefits\").\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 159; *see id.,* \u00b6 160 (stating that while Article 1101 is \"instructive in that it expressly recognizes the propriety of a claim... for an unfounded denial of benefits under Article 814,\" and \"thus provides useful context for such a claim,\" \"the claim asserted here is for breach of Article 814, not breach of Article 1101\").\n\n144.\n\nThe Parties clearly differ about whether the FTA contemplates any affirmative claims for a State's unfounded denial of benefits, with the Claimant saying it does, and the Respondent saying it does not. This appears to be an issue of first impression, and ultimately, any tribunal resolving this debate would need to consider a number of issues. Without prejudice to further briefing, the relevant questions would seem to include *at least* the following:\n\na. Was Article 814 intended solely to create a defense for the Contracting States (*i.e.,* to deny benefits in certain circumstances), or also to create substantive treaty obligations (*i.e.,* not to deny benefits otherwise), which might be capable of being breached and for which a claim might be brought?\n\nb. To the extent Article 814 might create substantive obligations, what is the applicable standard for breach? For example, is the provision breached any time a State attempts to deny benefits, simply because that attempt is later rejected by a tribunal? Or does the standard incorporate some element of wrongfulness, which distinguishes between a bad faith invocation of Article 814 and a potentially mistaken but good faith invocation, based on the State's contemporaneous understanding or belief about an investor's ownership, control and substantial business activities?\n\nc. For this question, should an analogy be made to the assertion of other jurisdictional objections or merits defenses, which (even if unsuccessful), generally are not considered to give rise to additional substantive treaty breaches, or is a denial of benefits qualitatively different, such that an unfounded denial would be an independent breach of a State's obligations to investors?\n\nd. To the extent any breach were to be found, would it give rise to any claim for relief other than a potential assessment of costs incurred in disputing a denial of benefits, which already may be considered in the context of a holistic costs determination at the end of an arbitration proceeding?\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no need to engage now in any analysis of any of these questions, which the Parties have not yet briefed in any detail. As discussed during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the only question properly before the Tribunal at this stage is whether the Claimant's new claim is *admissible* under Arbitration Rule 40.117 The main purpose of Arbitration Rule 40 is to regulate when new claims may be asserted in the context of an ongoing proceeding, and alternatively when they may need to be pursued (if at all) through the commencement of a separate proceeding.\n\nRev. Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 148:4-150:17 (answers by Mr. Legum and Mr. Adam, for the Claimant and the Respondent respectively, to questions by the Tribunal President).\n\n146.\n\nArbitration Rule 40(1), entitled \"Ancillary Claims,\" provides as follows:\n\n(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its observations thereon.\n\n147.\n\nThe three paragraphs of Rule 40 may be seen as addressing, respectively, the substantive, temporal and procedural requirements of admissibility of an ancillary claim. The Tribunal considers these requirements in turn below.\n\n148.\n\nWith regard to the substantive requirements, the admissibility of a new claim is governed by the same regime whether the claim at issue is characterized as an \"incidental\" or an \"additional\" claim. Although the two terms are not defined, their plain meaning carries somewhat different connotations, with the word \"incidental\" generally connoting \"something that happens in connection with something else, as a minor consequence of or an accompaniment to the other matter,\" whereas the word \"additional\" does not on its own terms necessarily require a connection to an existing event.118 Nonetheless, Arbitration Rule 40 draws no distinction between incidental and additional claims, both of which are deemed to be subsets of a broader concept, denominated as \"ancillary claims.\"119 In both instances, the applicable test is the same.\n\n*Lao Holdings N.V. and Sanum Investments Limited v. Lao People\u2019s Democratic* Republic, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/(AF)/16/2 and ADHOC/17/1 (\"***Lao Holdings\"**).* Procedural Order No. 2 (23 October 2017), \u00b6 21 (referencing various dictionary definitions of the word \"incidental\"), available at http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C5526/DC11255 En.pdf.\n\n*Cf.**Lao Holdings,* Procedural Order No. 3 (14 November 2017), \u00b6 10\u00a0(making the same observation about Article 47 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules); available at http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C5526/DC11336 En.pdf.\n\n149.\n\nThat test has two components. First, as a threshold matter, a Tribunal must consider under Arbitration Rule 40(1) whether the new claim would \"be within the scope of consent of the parties and... otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" The Tribunal does not interpret this language as requiring \u2013 nor has either Party in this case suggested it requires \u2013 \"a mini-trial and decision on all potential jurisdictional objections in order to determine, at the threshold stage, if an ancillary claim even may be admitted for examination.\"120 Rather, \"[i]f the same claim could have been admitted... for further proceedings had it had been included in an original request for arbitration, then [this] threshold admissibility inquiry... is likewise satisfied.\"121 Simply put, a tribunal may admit an ancillary claim for consideration, while still permitting a respondent to raise jurisdictional objections as part of its observations on that claim.\n\n*Lao Holdings,* Procedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 7.\n\n*Id.*\n\n150.\n\nThe second and more immediate requirement for admissibility under Arbitration Rule 40(1) is whether the incidental or additional claim \"aris[es] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute.\" For this purpose, the Tribunal considers that the subject matter of the dispute cannot be defined strictly by the boundaries of the original legal claims, or the test would become a tautology requiring that any new claims arise directly from prior claims, which by definition any \"additional\" claim (as distinct from a purely \"incidental\" claim) could never satisfy. For the test to have any meaning, \"the dispute\" must be defined as having an objective subject matter that is broader than the original legal claims themselves, so as to allow for the possibility of an \"additional\" claim that is distinct from the prior claims, but still arises directly out of the same *subject matter* of the general dispute.\n\n151.\n\nThis is entirely consistent with the framing of the unofficial commentary on the original 1968 ICSID Arbitration Rules, which queries whether adjudication of the ancillary claims is necessary to \"achieve the final settlement of *the dispute*,\" as distinct from the final settlement only of the original claims.122 The commentary envisions that this will occur only where there is a close \"factual connection\" between the original and ancillary claims, but this does not mean that an ancillary claim cannot involve *additional* facts \u2013 simply that any additional factual inquiry must have a sufficient *connection* to the matrix of facts already present in the dispute before the tribunal. A factual connection is not the same as an identity of facts.\n\nICSID Rules and Regulations 1968 (with commentary), available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/ICSID%20Regulations%20and%20Rules%201968%20-%20ENG.pdf (commentary on Rule 40) (emphasis added).\n\n152.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal does not accept that the \"subject-matter of the dispute\" can be defined so expansively as to mean any and all harm to a particular investment, which can be attributed to a given State under laws of international State responsibility. If one set of official acts against a particular investment (say, by Actor A in Year B) has no real factual connection to another set of official acts against that investment (say by Actor C in Year D), the fact that the two entirely separate grievances independently caused harm to the same investment would not necessarily mean that claims about the latter \"aris[e] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\" initiated to resolve the former. This again is why the Explanatory Note requires a sufficiently close \"factual connection\" between the two sets of claims, which cannot be established simply by observing that the they both involve the same investment and the same respondent State.\n\n153.\n\nApplying these principles to the case at hand, the Tribunal considers that there is sufficient linkage between the original claims and the proposed new claim to satisfy the requirements of Arbitration Rule 40(1). The new claim about an allegedly unfounded invocation of the denial of benefits provision has a direct factual connection to the original claims, since the benefit sought to be denied is the ability to pursue redress for the subject matter of the original claims. It would be nonsensical, in these circumstances, to require the new claim to be brought in a separate proceeding.\n\n154.\n\nAs for the second requirement of Arbitration Rule 40 \u2013 addressing the temporal requirements for asserting an ancillary claim that meets the substantive admissibility requirement set forth in Article 40(1) \u2013 Article 40(2) distinguishes between (a) ancillary claims that may be presented as a matter of right (\"[a]n incidental or additional claim shall be presented no later than in the reply\"), and (b) ancillary claims that may be presented later only with Tribunal authorization (\"unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim an upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in this proceeding\"). There is no dispute that the Claimant's new claim in this case falls into the former category, as it was presented during an initial bifurcated phase of this case to consider one of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, and well prior to the Claimant's reply on the merits.\n\n155.\n\nFinally, the third provision in Arbitration Rule 40 addresses the procedural implications of a decision to admit an ancillary claim. Rule 40(3) provides that \"[t]he Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its observations thereon.\" Taken together with Rule 40(2), which provides claimants the right to file ancillary claims as late as their reply on the merits, the text suggests that an ancillary claim may be permitted even if only one round of responsive briefing still may be afforded in the written stage of the proceeding (*i.e.,* in a respondent's rejoinder memorial). This is consistent with the unofficial commentary to Rule 40, which sets out explicitly that \"[n]ormally the written procedure on an ancillary claim is restricted to one 'round,'\" although tribunals obviously have discretion to permit additional briefing if they consider this appropriate.123 Be that as it may, because the Claimant in this case pleaded its ancillary claim prior to the Respondent's counter-memorial on the merits, the Respondent will have two opportunities to address the claim, namely in that submission and, after the Claimant responds in its reply on the merits, in its subsequent rejoinder.\n\n*Id.* (commentary on Rule 40). Indeed, even with respect to claims originally pleaded, the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant parties as a matter of right only one round of written submissions, while making a potential second round subject to party agreement or tribunal discretion. *See* ICSID Arbitration Rule 31(1) (\"the written procedure shall consist of... (a) a memorial by the requesting party; (b) a counter-memorial by the other party; and, *if the parties so agree or the Tribunal deems it* necessary: (c) a reply by the requesting party; and (d) a rejoinder by the other party.\") (emphasis added).\n\n156.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the substantive, temporal and procedural requirements of Arbitration Rule 40 have been met. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant's new claim as admissible, without prejudice to the Respondent's ability to challenge that claim, in its forthcoming written submissions, on either jurisdictional or substantive grounds.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n157.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) the Respondent's request to dismiss the Claimant's claims, on the basis that the Respondent validly denied the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA to Claimant pursuant to Article 814(2) of the FTA, is denied;\n\n(2) the Claimant's request to dismiss the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction on the basis of Article 814(2) of the FTA is granted;\n\n(3) the Respondent's request to dismiss the Claimant's new claim for breach of Article 814(2) of the FTA, on the grounds that it does not meet the requirements for an ancillary claim under Arbitration Rule 40, is denied;\n\n(4) the Claimant's request for a declaration that Respondent breached Article 814(2) through its purporting to deny benefits is denied as premature, pending further briefing from the Parties regarding the availability of relief for such a claim; and\n\n(5) the Tribunal reserves decision on the Parties' respective requests for costs, for determination in conjunction with any subsequent such requests at the close of this proceeding."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 10 (Decision on Non-Disputing Party Application)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2021-08-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 10 (Decision on Non-Disputing Party Application)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

It provides, *inter alia*, that these proceedings are conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, except to the extent modified by Section B of Chapter Eight (Investment) of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia signed on 21 November 2008 and which entered into force on 15 August 2011 (the \"**Treaty**\" or the \"**FTA**\").

The parties shall have the right to submit observations in relation to any non-disputing party application for leave to file a non-disputing party submission, and to any non-disputing party submissions, in accordance with the schedule prescribed by the Arbitral Tribunal or as agreed to between the parties.\n\n25.3. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) and Article 831 of the Treaty, the Tribunal shall ensure that any non-disputing party submission does not unduly disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party.\n\n25.4. The Tribunal shall decide whether and to what degree a non-disputing party granted leave to make a submission shall be granted access to the pleadings submitted by the parties, subject to the deletion of confidential information and excluding their supporting documentation (including exhibits, witness statements, and expert reports). Any access to the pleadings shall be granted upon the execution of a non-disclosure agreement by the non-disputing party.\n\n3.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), and Article 831 and Annex 831 of the Treaty, referenced in Section 25 of PO1 provide as follows:\n\n**Rule 37**\n\n[\u2026] **Submissions of Non-disputing Parties**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(2) After consulting both parties, the Tribunal may allow a person or entity that is not a party to the dispute (in this Rule called the \"non-disputing party\") to file a written submission with the Tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute. In determining whether to allow such a filing, the Tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which:\n\n(a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties;\n\n(b) the non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;\n\n(c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding.\n\nThe Tribunal shall ensure that the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party, and that both parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the non-disputing party submission.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**Article 831: Submissions by a Non-Disputing Party**\n\n1.

The application for leave to file a non-disputing party submission shall:\n\n(a) be made in writing, dated and signed by the applicant, and include the applicant's address and other contact details;\n\n(b) be no longer than five typed pages;\n\n(c) describe the applicant, including, where relevant, its membership and legal status (e.g., company, trade association or other non-governmental organization), its general objectives, the nature of its activities, and any parent organization (including any organization that directly or indirectly controls the applicant);\n\n(d) disclose whether the applicant has any affiliation, direct or indirect, with any disputing party;\n\n(e) identify any government, person or organization that has provided any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission;\n\n(f) demonstrate that the applicant has a significant interest and specify the nature of this interest in the arbitration;\n\n(g) identify the specific issues of fact or law in the arbitration that the applicant will address in its written submission;\n\n(h) explain why the Tribunal should accept the submission; and\n\n(i) be made in a language of the arbitration.\n\n2. The submission filed by a non-disputing party shall:\n\n(a) be dated and signed by the person filing the submission;\n\n(b) be concise, and in no case longer than 20 typed pages, including any appendices;\n\n(c) set out a precise statement supporting the applicant's position on the issues; and\n\n(d) only address matters within the scope of the dispute.\n\n4.\n\nOn 5 October 2020, the *Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual de Mineros \"EL COGOTE\"* (the \"**El Cogote Association**\" or the \"**Applicant**\") filed with ICSID an application for leave to intervene as non-disputing party, written in Spanish, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), Article 831 and Annex 831 of the Treaty (the \"**Application**\"). A copy of the Application was transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Claimant and the Respondent (jointly, the \"**Parties**\") and the Members of the Tribunal on 6 October 2020.\n\n5.\n\nOn 6 October 2020, the Tribunal invited the representatives of the El Cogote Association to submit an English translation of their Application at their earliest convenience, on the basis that the procedural languages of this arbitration are English and Spanish. In addition, the Tribunal informed the representatives of the El Cogote Association that it would invite comments from the Parties pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) upon receipt of that translation.\n\n6.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Parties requested the Tribunal to defer its decision on the Application on the ground that it was premature, as they considered that none of the issues raised by the Applicant was pertinent to the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. In particular, the Parties requested the Tribunal to defer its decision on the Application until after the Tribunal's resolution of the Respondent's denial of benefits objection to jurisdiction and, should that objection be denied, until after the Respondent's submission of its Counter-Memorial on the remaining jurisdictional and merits issues in the case.\n\n7.\n\nOn the same date, the El Cogote Association filed an English translation of its Application of 5 October 2020. A copy of that translation was transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Tribunal and the Parties on 14 October 2020.\n\n8.\n\nOn 30 October 2020, the Tribunal granted the Parties' request of 13 October 2020. It decided that deferral of the Application was appropriate, *inter alia*, as the Tribunal would be assisted by reference to the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, which was yet to be filed, in addition to the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits filed on 7 October 2019, to determine whether the proposed non-disputing party submission met the standard set out in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 December 2020, following the Tribunal's Decision on the Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue of 23 November 2020 - by which it dismissed the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction based on Article 814(2) of the FTA - the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (\"**PO8**\"), setting out revised dates of the procedural calendar for the arbitration. The revised schedule set out in PO8 included the following deadlines: ***(i)*** 10 June 2021, for any interested third party to apply for leave to file a non-disputing party submission pursuant to Article 831 of the FTA; ***(ii)*** 15 July 2021, for the Parties to file responses to any non-disputing party application; ***(iii)*** 12 August 2021, for the Tribunal to rule on any non-disputing party application; and ***(iv)*** 26 August 2021, for the filing of non-disputing party submissions.\n\n10.\n\nOn 6 May 2021, following a request from the Respondent for a 7-week extension of the deadline to submit its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 (\"**PO9**\"), concerning the procedural calendar. Pursuant to the revised dates of the procedural calendar set out in PO9, the deadlines regarding non-disputing party participation were amended as follows: ***(i)*** 8 July 2021, for any interested third party to apply for leave to file a non-disputing party submission pursuant to Article 831 of the FTA; ***(ii)*** 12 August 2021, for the Parties to file responses to any non-disputing party application; ***(iii)*** 9 September 2021, for the Tribunal to rule on any non-disputing party application; and ***(iv)*** 23 September 2021, for the filing of non-disputing party submissions.\n\n11.\n\nOn 11 June 2021, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with accompanying documents.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 August 2021, pursuant to the schedule set out in PO9, the Parties filed their respective responses to the Application filed by the El Cogote Association. Claimant's submission was accompanied by a consolidated index of factual exhibits and legal authorities, as well as legal authorities CL-0214 to CL-0220. Respondent's submission was accompanied by a consolidated list of legal authorities, as well as legal authorities RL-0210 to RL-0215.\n\n13.\n\nThis Order sets out the Tribunal's decision on the Application filed by the El Cogote Association.\n\n**II. THE APPLICATION**\n-----------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **A****pplicant**\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Application is submitted by the Mutual Association of Miners \"El Cogote,\" a non-profit Colombian legal entity based in the Municipality of Segovia. The El Cogote Association states that it has \"more than 40 years of work in the region,\" dedicated to \"non-profit mining extraction and reverting its surpluses in its corporate purpose with 119 associates which generate employment for more than 600 people in the Antioquia Northeast Region.\"1\n\nApplication, pp. 1-2.\n\n**B. S****ignificant** **I****nterest**\n---------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant submits that it has a significant interest in the arbitration as a result of the Claimant's reference in its Request for Arbitration to the El Cogote mine. The Applicant refers to its mission to defend the possession of the El Cogote mine by traditional and ancestral miners associated with the Applicant, and to safeguard the well-being of the population in the Municipalities of Segovia and Remedios. It also claims a right to information and participation in the proceedings in order to respond to allegations regarding illegal mining at the El Cogote mine, and to provide distinct views on disputed issues related to its goals and activities.2\n\nId., pp. 2-3.\n\n**C. T****he** **S****ubject****-M****atter of the** **P****roposed** **S****ubmission**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Applicant states that it wishes to address in a written submission the following factual and legal issues in dispute: **(*****i*****)** the socioeconomic and cultural context of the El Cogote mine; **(*****ii*****)** the historical context of investment in FGM3 assets, demand for direct repair against the State, alleged corruption in the acquisition of the RPP-140 title and the possession of the El Cogote mine; ***(iii)*** the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*; **(*****iv*****)** manifestations of the civilian population, including related negotiations, Claimant's proposals and a precautionary measure resolution by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights; **(*****v*****)** the Claimant's responsibility for violation of collective rights; and **(*****vi*****)** the mining legislation in favor of large extractive industries, the difference between illegal and traditional or ancestral mining, Colombia's international responsibility and Canada's extraterritorial responsibility for the Claimant's actions.4\n\nThe Tribunal understands the Applicant to refer to Frontino Gold Mines Ltd, the previous owner of some of the mining titles now owned by the Claimant, including RPP-140.\n\nApplication, pp. 3-4.\n\n17.\n\nThe Applicant further invites the Tribunal to a site visit in the Municipalities of Segovia and Remedios to conduct an investigation of the investment project at issue.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimant****'****s** **R****esponse**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn its letter of 12 August 2021, the Claimant opposes on three grounds the Applicant's request to file a non-disputing party submission. The Claimant did not comment on the Applicant's request to schedule a site visit.\n\n19.\n\n***First***, with reference to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) and Article 831 of the FTA, the Claimant argues that the Applicant's submission would unfairly prejudice it because the El Cogote Association does not seek merely to assist the Tribunal as a \"friend to the court\" by offering special perspectives on issues in dispute, but rather acts as a protagonist implicated in the underlying facts.5\n\n5 The Claimant\u2019s Response dated 12 August 2021, pp. 1-2.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant points out that its claims in the arbitration relate, *inter alia*, to Colombia's failure to enforce eviction orders in favor of GCG Segovia against illegal miners operating in the El Cogote mine, which orders were granted by the Colombian Mining Agency, after GCG Segovia's unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate with the El Cogote Association to hire its constituents as contract miners.6 The Applicant's intervention thus would not bring a useful perspective on broader policy issues in dispute, as was the case for *amici curiae* submissions in cases such as *Methanex*, *Biwater* and *Eli Lilly* (where none of the non-disputing parties played a role in the underlying dispute), but instead would provide essentially a witness statement on disputed questions of fact, without permitting the Claimant or the Tribunal to test its credibility and reliability through cross-examination.7\n\nId., p. 2.\n\nId., p. 3.\n\n21.\n\n***Second***, the Claimant contends that the subject-matter of the proposed submission would fall outside the scope of the dispute as defined by the Parties, such as allegations of corruption, the alleged extraterritorial responsibility of Canada or the alleged violation of collective rights by the Claimant.8\n\nId., p. 4.\n\n22.\n\n***Finally***, the Claimant argues that the El Cogote Association would not bring a new perspective, particular knowledge or insight from that presented by Colombia in its submissions. It notes in this regard that the Applicant intends to refer to several factual and legal matters that have been already covered by the Respondent in its submissions or that merely echo the Respondent's position.9\n\nId., pp. 4-5.\n\n**B. T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **R****esponse**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn its response of 12 August 2021, the Respondent does not object to the Application and \"considers that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to allow it,\" although it disagrees that a site visit and inquiry in Segovia and Remedios would be necessary for the Tribunal to resolve the dispute.10\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Response dated 12 August 2021, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 16.\n\n24.\n\n***First***, given a number of references to the El Cogote Association and its activities in the Parties' submissions and witness statements, the Respondent asserts that the Applicant has a significant interest in the arbitration. It notes that the issues in dispute concern the community of artisanal and small-scale miners in Segovia whom the Applicant represents, which makes the Applicant uniquely placed to assist the Tribunal in offering its first-hand perspective, knowledge and insight different from those provided by the Parties.11\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.12 Id., \u00b6\u00b6 12-15\n\n25.\n\n***Second***, the Respondent submits that the questions which the El Cogote Association has proposed to address in the proceedings are relevant and apposite for the resolution of the dispute. This includes, for example, matters related to the socioeconomic and cultural context of El Cogote mine and the negotiations between artisanal miners and the Claimant.12\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 12-15\n\n26.\n\n***Finally***, the Respondent submits that the Applicant's proposed submission would not unfairly prejudice either Party or disrupt the arbitration, as the FTA and Annex A of PO1 (as amended by PO9) set out detailed conditions and procedural steps for non-disputing party applications.13\n\nId., \u00b6 15\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nUnder the applicable test, pursuant to Article 831 and Annex 831 of the FTA, ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), referenced in Section 25 of PO1, the Tribunal may allow a non-disputing party application if each of four conditions is met:\n\ni. The non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceedings;\n\nii. The non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;\n\niii. The non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceedings by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing Parties; and\n\niv. The non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceedings or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party.\n\n28.\n\n*With respect to the first condition*, the Claimant does not dispute that the El Cogote Association has an interest in the proceedings. The dispute revolves around the RPP-140 title, which encompasses the El Cogote mine, and both Parties refer extensively to the local miners in their written submissions in this arbitration. Indeed, part of the Claimant's case is the Respondent's alleged failure to enforce eviction orders against miners, one of them regarding miners specifically in the El Cogote mine. Against this background, the Tribunal considers that the Applicant not only has an interest in the proceedings, but also that such interest is \"significant,\" within the meaning of the first condition of the applicable test.\n\n29.\n\n*As for the second condition*, the El Cogote Association explains in its Application that if granted leave to file a submission, it will do so with reference to six separate issues. For the sake of convenience, they are recounted here:\n\ni. the socioeconomic and cultural context of El Cogote mine, the Municipalities of Segovia and Remedios, and the Armed Conflict;\n\nii. the historical context of investment in FGM assets, demand for direct repair against the State, alleged corruption in the acquisition of the RPP-140 title and the possession of El Cogote mine;\n\niii. the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*;\n\niv. manifestations of the civilian population, including related negotiations, Claimant's proposals and a precautionary measure resolution by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights;\n\nv. the Claimant's responsibility for violation of collective rights, healthy environment and others; res judicata by the Council of State and alleged corruption case; and\n\nvi. the mining legislation in favor of large extractive industries, the difference between illegal and traditional or ancestral mining, Colombia's international responsibility and Canada's extraterritorial responsibility for the Claimant's actions.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that while certain aspects of the El Cogote Association's intended submission would address matters within the scope of the dispute, at least parts of two of the six issues fall outside of the scope. These are number (v), *i.e.*, \"the Claimant's responsibility for violation of collective rights, healthy environment and others,\" and part of number (vi), *i.e.*, \"Colombia's international responsibility and Canada's extraterritorial responsibility for the Claimant's actions.\" There is no claim in this case regarding an alleged violation (a) by the Claimant of some duty vis-\u00e0-vis \"collective rights, healthy environment and others,\" (b) by Colombia of some \"international responsibility\" to protect traditional or ancestral mining, or (c) by Canada of some responsibility over \"the Claimant's actions.\" To the extent the Application seeks to present arguments regarding such alleged violations, such arguments clearly would expand this dispute outside of its scope, in contravention of the applicable legal framework for non-disputing party submissions.\n\n31.\n\nBy contrast, three of the issues identified by the Application are clearly within the scope of the dispute, namely issues (i), (iii) and (iv). The Parties themselves have referenced these issues in their respective submissions. The same is true for part of issue (vi), namely \"the mining legislation in favor of large extractive industries [and] the difference between illegal and traditional or ancestral mining,\" which has been addressed by the Respondent in its Counter Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n32.\n\nIssue number (ii) presents more difficulties, in particular as it reflects an intention by the Applicant to address alleged corruption in the acquisition of the RPP-140 title. On the one hand, neither Party has raised any corruption allegations, which means that such allegations could be viewed as outside of the scope of the dispute. On the other hand, the RPP-140 title itself is clearly within the scope of the dispute, in the sense that the Claimant's case rests on the assumption that the relevant mining permissions are valid and convey rights, which the Claimant says the Respondent violated and/or failed to protect. If (entirely hypothetically at this juncture) those permissions had been obtained through corruption, that fact could be of relevance to the existence or enforceability of the very rights the Claimant seeks to assert. It could also be of relevance to the Tribunal's assessment of its duties under the Treaty, the ICSID Convention, and international law. Moreover, as a general matter, the fact that neither an investor nor a host State may wish to address non-party allegations of corruption \u2013 including those that may implicate their respective representatives \u2013 does not require a tribunal to turn a blind eye to such allegations, if (again, entirely hypothetically) those allegations were to prove serious and well-substantiated. For these reasons, the Tribunal on balance considers that issue number (ii) is \u2013 or at least has the potential to be brought \u2013 within the scope of the dispute.\n\n33.\n\nThis leaves four issues and a part of a fifth*,* *to be tested against the third condition*, which requires that the Tribunal be assisted \"in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing Parties.\" In the Tribunal's view, one issue plainly fails to meet this condition, namely issue (iii) concerning the Tribunal's alleged lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*. It has not been established how the Tribunal would be assisted by the El Cogote Association's particular knowledge or insight on this issue, which is one of an intrinsically legal nature where the Association's knowledge can be assumed to be of limited assistance to the Tribunal, and which furthermore has been covered in the Parties' submissions. The same is true for issue (vi)'s reference to \"the mining legislation in favor of large extractive industries [and] the difference between illegal and traditional or ancestral mining\"; the Tribunal does not consider it to have been demonstrated that a non-disputing party submission on these issues would assist the Tribunal, particularly given their legal nature and the fact that they already have been addressed by at least one Party.\n\n34.\n\nBy contrast, issues (i), (ii) and (iv) would seem to meet the third condition, because they address the specific context of the El Cogote mine, the local miners whom the El Cogote Association claims to represent, and the interactions between those miners and the GCG Segovia. On these issues, the Tribunal accepts that the El Cogote Association has a \"perspective, particular knowledge or insight\" that is likely to be different from that of either Claimant or Respondent.\n\n35.\n\nHaving found that the El Cogote Association has a significant interest in the proceedings, and that three of the issues it seeks to address meet the second and third conditions of the applicable test, the Tribunal now turns to the final condition, *i.e.*, whether the submission would \"disrupt the proceedings or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party.\"\n\n36.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to show that the filing of a 20-page submission, as limited to these three issues, would constitute such disruption, burden or prejudice. The Tribunal notes that the procedural calendar contained in PO9 already includes a deadline for the filing of any non-disputing party's submission, and that this filing was scheduled deliberately to fall before the Parties' second round of submissions (Reply and Rejoinder), in order to provide ample opportunity for the Parties to comment.\n\n37.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal finds unpersuasive the Claimant's arguments that the potential factual (as opposed to purely legal) nature of any submission by the El Cogote Association creates undue prejudice, by equating such submission to a witness statement which cannot be tested in cross-examination. First, both Rule 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Annex 831(g) of the FTA specifically envision non-disputing party submissions on factual issues, the former by referencing submissions that \"would assist the Tribunal in *the determination of a factual* or legal issue related to the proceeding,\" and the latter by requiring an applicant to \"identify the *specific issues of fact* or law in the arbitration that the applicant will address in its written submission\" (emphasis added). If the very fact that a proffered submission is likely to contain factual assertions on disputed issues were grounds to reject an application for undue prejudice, then these requirements in the applicable rules would be rendered nugatory. As for the fact that the Applicant is allegedly a \"protagonist\" in this dispute, there is no requirement in the applicable rules that a non-disputing party has had no role in the underlying events, such that the factual issues it wishes to address (pursuant to the rules) are solely ones in which it did not participate. Indeed, any such requirement would tend to undermine Rule 37(2)(a)'s requirement that an applicant have a \"perspective, *particular knowledge* or insight\" into the \"specific issues of fact or law in the arbitration\" that it wishes to address. Almost by definition, \"particular knowledge\" regarding an \"issue[] of fact \u2026 in the arbitration\" is likely to have been obtained by participating in the factual events in question.\n\n38.\n\nThe important point is that the Parties will have the opportunity to comment on the credibility and weight of any assertions by the El Cogote Association, and that this Tribunal, like any tribunal permitting a non-disputing party submission on issues in dispute, has tools available to evaluate the non-disputing party assertions as well as the Parties' comments thereon. The Tribunal will review the submissions of the El Cogote Association alongside the Parties' submissions, oral pleadings and the totality of the evidence on record before rendering any decision in this arbitration. Moreover, if the non-disputing party submission contains notable factual assertions which the Tribunal feels ought to be tested directly, the Tribunal has the power to request further evidence from the El Cogote Association, including but not limited to non-party witnesses,14 in order to examine whether such assertions are properly supported. In granting the Application of the El Cogote Association at least in part, the Tribunal expressly puts that Association on notice that the Tribunal may ask it to substantiate any significant factual assertions if it wishes those assertions to be given any potential weight.\n\n14 See generally Procedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 19.1 (allowing the Tribunal to take guidance from the 2010 IBA Rules); IBA Rules, Articles 3(9), 3(10), and 4(9) (addressing the authority of arbitral tribunals to seek documents or witness testimony from non-parties).\n\n39.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal denies the El Cogote Association's \"invitation\" that the Tribunal conduct a site visit to the Municipalities of Segovia and Remedios. As a threshold matter, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the FTA authorize a non-disputing party to seek permission to file a written submission, but say nothing about any right of a non-disputing party to seek a site visit. Moreover, in circumstances where neither Party has requested a site visit, the Tribunal struggles to understand \u2013 and the El Cogote Association has failed to demonstrate \u2013 how such a complex and costly site visit would be justified.\n\n**V. ORDER**\n------------\n\n40.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal hereby:\n\na) GRANTS the El Cogote Association's Application only insofar as it seeks leave to file a written submission on points (i), (ii) and (iv) of its application, described as:\n\n\u2022 the socioeconomic and cultural context of El Cogote mine and the Municipalities of Segovia and Remedios, and the Armed Conflict;\n\n\u2022 the historical context of investment in FGM assets, demand for direct repair against the State, alleged corruption in the acquisition of the RPP-140 title and the possession of El Cogote mine; and\n\n\u2022 manifestations of the civilian population, including related negotiations, Claimant's proposals and a precautionary measure resolution by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights;\n\nb) DENIES the El Cogote Association's Application to file a written submission on any other issues;\n\nc) DIRECTS that the submission of the El Cogote Association comply with the requirements of Annex 831(2) of the FTA, including specifically that the submission be no more than 20 pages;\n\nd) DIRECTS that the submission of the El Cogote Association be filed electronically (in English and Spanish) with the ICSID Secretariat by 23 September 2021, pursuant to the timetable set forth in Procedural Order No. 9; and\n\ne) DENIES the invitation of the El Cogote Association that the Tribunal conduct a site visit."}]}
