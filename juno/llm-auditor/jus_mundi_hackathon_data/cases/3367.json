Veeder\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision addresses a proposal filed on October 18, 2019 by Ayat Nizar Raja Sumrain, Eshraka Nizar Raja Sumrain, Alaa Nizar Raja Sumrain and Mohamed Nizar Raja Sumrain (the \"**Claimants**\"), for the disqualification of a majority of the members of the Tribunal, *i.e.*, the President of the Tribunal, Prof. Zachary Douglas, appointed by agreement of the Parties and Mr. V. V. Veeder, the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent (the \"**Proposal**\").The State of Kuwait (\"**Kuwait**\", or the \"**Respondent**\") opposes the Proposal.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Article 58 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\"), this Decision has been taken by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (the \"**Chairman**\"). The Decision sets out the relevant procedural history in Section II, then summarizes the Proposal, the Parties' submissions and the Arbitrators' explanations in Section III. In Section IV, the Chairman provides the reasons for the decision contained in Section V.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn June 12, 2019, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") received a Request for Arbitration submitted by the Claimants against Kuwait. In accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request on June 30, 2019.\n\n4.\n\nBy email of August 3, 2019, the Claimants informed ICSID that they wished to appoint Mr. N. Fernando Pi\u00e9rola, a national of Peru and Switzerland, as arbitrator. By the same email, the Claimants made a proposal to the Respondent regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. By letter of August 5, 2019, ICSID informed the Parties that absent a determination of the method of the constitution of the Tribunal, the Centre could not take further action on the proposed appointment of Mr. Pi\u00e9rola.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 11, 2019, the Claimants informed ICSID that they had chosen the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention with respect to the constitution of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 12, 2019, ICSID confirmed to the Parties that the Tribunal would be constituted pursuant to Art. 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and would consist of three arbitrators: one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties. ICSID further informed the Parties that it would proceed to seek Mr. Pi\u00e9rola's acceptance of his appointment in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 5(2). By the same letter, ICSID invited the Claimants, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 3(1)(a)(i) and (ii), to make a proposal for the President of the Tribunal and invited the Respondent to concur in this proposal and to appoint an arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of September 13, 2019, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Pi\u00e9rola had accepted his appointment as arbitrator in this case.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 16, 2019, by email addressed directly to the Respondent and copied to ICSID, the Claimants proposed a list of candidates to act as President of the Tribunal. That list included Prof. Zachary Douglas, a national of Australia.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of September 27, 2019, the Respondent informed ICSID that it appointed Mr. V. V. Veeder, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. By that same letter, the Respondent agreed with the Claimants' proposal of Prof. Douglas as President of the Tribunal. By letter of the same date, ICSID took note of the Respondent's appointment of Mr. Veeder and of the Parties' agreement to appoint Prof. Douglas as the presiding arbitrator. ICSID further informed the Parties that it would proceed to seek Mr. Veeder's and Prof. Douglas' acceptance of their respective appointments, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 5(2).\n\n10.\n\nMr. Veeder accepted his appointment on September 28, 2019 and submitted a signed Declaration pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2). By email of the same day, the Claimants stated that they \"accept the appointment of Mr. Veeder as the [R]espondent['s] party-appointed arbitrator [\u2026] [and] confirm the appointment of Prof. Zachary Douglas as the president of the arbitral tribunal.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn September 29, 2019, the Claimants sent two emails. The first email stated: \"[W]e regret to inform you that we reject the appointment of Mr. V. V. Veeder QC, and also Prof. Zachary Douglas QC; as they have worked together with the [R]espondent[] and [its] legal representative[s]. We shall explain in detail in another email.\" The second email contained the Claimants' explanations for now objecting to the appointments of Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder. The Claimants also invited the Respondent to appoint another arbitrator replacing Mr. Veeder and propose another candidate to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nBy email of September 30, 2019, the Respondent stated that it was considering the Claimants' correspondence of September 29, 2019.\n\n13.\n\nBy email of September 30, 2019, the Claimants proposed a second list of candidates to act as President of the Tribunal and invited the Respondent to choose one of those candidates. On the same day, ICSID took note of the Parties' correspondence of September 29 and 30, 2019, and recalled ICSID Arbitration Rule 7, allowing each party to replace an arbitrator appointed by it and the Parties to replace any arbitrator by agreement, at any time before the Tribunal is constituted.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 1, 2019, ICSID informed the Parties that on September 30, 2019, it had notified Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder of the Claimants' observations of September 29 and 30, 2019. By the same letter, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Veeder did not consider the Claimants' observations of September 29, 2019 to affect his acceptance of the appointment and consequently, he confirmed his acceptance of the appointment as arbitrator in this case.\n\n15.\n\nBy email of the same day, the Claimants reiterated: (i) their objections to the appointments of Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder; and (ii) their invitation to the Respondent to appoint another arbitrator and to propose another candidate for President of the Tribunal. The Claimants also proposed to extend the 90-day period provided for in Art. 38 of the ICSID Convention by 10 days.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, the Respondent replied to the Claimants' October 1, 2019 email, requesting that the Centre \"pay no credence\" to the Claimants' most recent correspondence and stating that \"[o]nce the Tribunal is constituted, it will be open to either party (including the Claimants) to seek to disqualify any of the members of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9.\"\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of the same day, ICSID noted that given the Respondent's letter, there did not seem to be agreement to replace Prof. Douglas or Mr. Veeder pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 7. ICSID also confirmed that it would convey the Respondent's letter to Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder.\n\n18.\n\nOn October 3, 2019, Prof. Douglas accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal and provided a Statement accompanying his Declaration pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2). Prof. Douglas confirmed in his Statement that he is currently sitting as an arbitrator in another ICSID case involving the State of Kuwait and that he did not consider this to be a circumstance that might cause his reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date.\n\n20.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, the Claimants submitted the Proposal. ICSID informed the Parties on the same day that the proceeding was suspended pending a decision on the Proposal, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). ICSID also provided a procedural calendar for the Parties' submissions on the Proposal and for explanations by Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). On October 23, 2019, following exchanges between the Parties, the procedural calendar was revised.\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with the revised procedural calendar, the Respondent responded to the Proposal on November 6, 2019 together with supporting documentation (the \"**Response**\").\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of November 13, 2019, ICSID transmitted the explanations of Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder furnished in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants filed observations on Prof. Douglas' and Mr. Veeder's explanations (the \"**Observations**\") on November 20, 2019. By email of November 21, 2019, the Respondent confirmed that it did not wish to submit observations on Prof. Douglas' and Mr. Veeder's explanations.\n\n**III. PARTIES' POSITIONS AND ARBITRATORS' EXPLANATIONS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Proposal and Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants' arguments on the Proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder were set forth in their submissions of October 18 and November 20, 2019. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder should be disqualified under Art. 57 of the ICSID Convention for manifest lack of the qualities required by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.1\n\nProposal, para. 13.\n\n***(1) Relevant Legal Standard***\n---------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants state that Art.14(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that the arbitrator \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgement.\"2 They argue that this requires an arbitrator to be \"impartial and independent,\"3 meaning that the arbitrator must be lacking in bias, predisposition towards a party, and external control.4\n\nProposal, para. 13.\n\nProposal, para. 17.\n\nProposal, para. 17.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the test for impartiality and independence under the ICSID Convention is an objective one, \"based on a reasonable evaluation by an informed third person of the circumstances and facts that justified doubts about an arbitrator's independence and impartiality.\"5 The Claimants assert that the appearance of bias or dependence is sufficient to satisfy this test. In this regard, they rely on the *Urbaser* case, in which it was held that \"[a]n appearance of such bias from a reasonable and informed third person's point of view is sufficient to justify doubts about an arbitrator's independence or impartiality.\"6\n\nProposal, para. 18 (citing *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, December 13, 2013 (\"***Burlington***\"), para. 67.\n\nProposal, para. 18 (citing *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Claimants' Proposal to Disqualify Professor Campbell McLachlan, August 12, 2010 (\"***Urbaser***\") (**R-001**), para. 43).\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants also cite the *Raiffeisen* case, which sets out the test for independence and impartiality as follows:\n\nArticles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias. All relevant facts shall be taken into account in establishing the appearance of dependence or bias. The legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an 'objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party [\u2026]7\n\nProposal, para. 19 (citing *Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Raiffeisenbank Austria D.D. v. Republic of Croatia*, ICSID Case No: ARB/17/34, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Stanimir Alexandrov, May 17, 2018 (\"***Raiffeisen***\") (**R-009**), paras. 83-84; *Elitech B.V. and Razvoj Golf D.O.O. v. Republic of Croatia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/32, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern, April 23, 2018 (\"***Elitech***\") (**R-008**), paras. 45-46).\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the *Tidewater* case and allege that multiple appointments of an arbitrator by the same party give rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality when accompanied by \"a material risk that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors outside the record in the case as a result of his or her knowledge derived from other cases.\"8\n\nProposal, para. 20 (citing *Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Coribe, C.A. and others. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Claimants' Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator, December 23, 2010 (\"***Tidewater***\") (**R-002**), para. 62).\n\n***(2) The Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Douglas***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants' Proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas alleges that he \"manifestly lacks the quality that an arbitrator may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"9\n\nProposal, para. 14.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants base this allegation on two facts: (i) Prof. Douglas presently sits as an arbitrator appointed by Kuwait in one on-going ICSID proceeding; and (ii) Prof. Douglas was appointed by States in the majority of cases in which he has served as arbitrator.\n\n**a. Prof. Douglas' Serves as an Arbitrator in One Pending ICSID Arbitration Appointed by Kuwait**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Prof. Douglas presently sits as the \"Kuwait-appointed arbitrator\" in one pending ICSID case, *Rizzani de Eccher S.p.A., Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain S.A. and Trevi S.p.A. v State of Kuwait* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/8) (\"***Rizzani***\").10 They argue this \"would raise in the mind of an informed and reasonable third party [\u2026] justified doubts as to Professor Douglas's reliability to exercise independent judgement [\u2026].\"11\n\nProposal, para. 14.\n\nProposal, para. 16.\n\n33.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, there is a material risk of influence by factors outside of the record, where multiple arbitrator appointments are made by the same party. In the Claimants' view, these factors may impact an arbitrator's independence and impartiality if: (i) similarities exist between the cases on which the challenged arbitrator sits; and (ii) there is a significant overlap in facts and parties.12 The Claimants submit that these two factors are present in this case.\n\nProposal, para. 21 (citing *Raiffeisen* (**R-009**), paras. 83-84); Observations, paras. 10-11.\n\n34.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants contend that the present case is similar to the *Rizzani* case, as the treaty provisions in the *Rizzani* case are \"almost identically-worded\" to the treaty provisions in the present case. The Claimants further contend that the two cases concern \"identical facts and conduct of Kuwait,\" which occurred partially within the same time frame (2010-2017), in the same area (Kuwait City), and involved investments in the same industry (construction).13\n\nProposal, paras. 22, 14-15; Observations, paras. 11, 13-16, 25.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the investors in both cases complain of Kuwait's alleged failings with respect to the issuance of required permits, and of \"unexpected and unjustified hostility,\" including alleged harassment and arbitrary application of financial penalties toward their joint ventures.14\n\nProposal, para. 24; Observations, para. 11.\n\n36.\n\nIn their Observations, the Claimants also noted that: (i) the cases concern projects which were part of the same urban development plan in Kuwait City;15 (ii) the contracts this case and the *Rizzani* case were awarded through a tender process;16 (iii) the location of the two projects are a 11-12 minute-drive apart and the roads on which the two projects are located are connected and hence \"practically the same;\"17 and (iv) the witnesses will potentially be the same because of the involvement of the same Kuwaiti governmental bodies in both projects.18\n\nObservations, para. 16.\n\nObservations, para. 21.\n\nObservations, paras. 16, 20.\n\nObservations, para. 19.\n\n37.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's arguments that there is not sufficient similarity between the two cases, the Claimants contend that the fact that the construction projects of the investors in the two cases were made under different investment contracts concluded with different government ministries is immaterial in the context of investment treaty claims seeking redress for breach of international obligations.19\n\nObservations, para. 15.\n\n38.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the two differences between the two cases raised by the Respondent *i.e.*, that the Respondent is represented by different legal counsel in each case and that the claimant investors in each case are different, are \"patently immaterial\".20\n\nObservations, para. 14.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the two cases involve similar facts, parties and similarly-worded treaty provisions, and clearly and objectively demonstrate that Prof. Douglas cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgement.21\n\nProposal, para. 25.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the *Elitech* case to argue that a disqualifying overlap exists when the other cases on which a challenged arbitrator sits arise in the same industry and appear to arise out of the same State conduct.22 The Claimants contend that this occurred in the present case.23\n\nProposal, para. 26 (citing *Elitech* (**R-008**), para. 54).\n\nProposal, para. 26.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the *Caratube* case to establish that \"prior exposure of an arbitrator to similar facts in another already pending arbitration against the same Respondent taint[s]\" the arbitrator's \"objectivity and open-mindedness, [and] objectively (in the view of a reasonable third person) constitutes a ground for disqualification.\"24 They submit that \"[t]his ground for disqualification is so well established in ICSID practice that any reasonable and informed third party would have expected Professor Douglas, as an experienced investment arbitrator, to refuse the appointment as President of the Tribunal in this case.\"25 Further, they argue that Prof. Douglas, like the arbitrator challenged in *Caratube*, cannot be expected to \"maintain a 'Chinese wall' in his own mind\" with respect to any information acquired in his capacity as arbitrator in *Rizzani*, and that Prof. Douglas would prejudge legal issues in the present case based on his knowledge of the facts underlying the *Rizzani* case.26\n\nProposal, para. 27 (citing *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Bruno Boesch, March 20, 2014 (\"***Caratube***\") (**R-004**), paras. 45, 90).\n\nProposal, para. 28.\n\nProposal, paras. 31-32 (citing *Caratube* (**R-004**), paras. 89-90).\n\n42.\n\nFinally, the Claimants take issue with the explanations provided by Prof. Douglas, which they describe as \"partial, insufficient, and defective.\" They assert that Prof. Douglas' description of events leading to the Tribunal's constitution contradicts the relevant correspondence and that he \"deliberately\" ignored the Claimants' objections to his appointment, reinforcing the view that a reasonable third party would have justifiable doubts about Prof. Douglas' reliability for independent judgment.27\n\nObservations, paras. 31-42.\n\n**b. Multiple Appointments of Prof. Douglas by Respondent States**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe second basis for the Claimants' Proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas is that he has been appointed by Respondent States as an arbitrator in 44 cases, contrasted with just two cases in which he was appointed by claimant investors and one case in which he was appointed by the appointing authority.28 In addition, the Claimants state that Prof. Douglas has served as a presiding arbitrator in only two prior cases.29 In the Claimants' view, Prof. Douglas' multiple arbitrator appointments by Respondent States are \"not a neutral and irrelevant factor in considering the present challenge.\"30\n\nProposal, para. 36, *see* fn. 24-25.\n\nProposal, para. 37.\n\nProposal, para. 38; Observations, para. 62.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Prof. Douglas' multiple arbitrator appointments by Respondent States demonstrates his established status as a \"pro-State arbitrator\" and causes him to lack the impartiality required of an ICSID presiding arbitrator.31 Referring to the ASIL-ICCA Joint Task Force on Issue Conflicts in Investor-State Arbitration, the Claimants argue that the appointment of a \"truly impartial presiding arbitrator\" goes to the core of the legitimacy of the tribunal,32 and that the right to a \"truly impartial arbitrator\" cannot be waived by any disputing party.33 The Claimants refer to the *OPIC* case in which the unchallenged arbitrators held that, \"[\u2026] multiple appointments of an arbitrator are an objective indication of the view of parties and their counsel that the outcome of the dispute is more likely to be successful with the multiple appointee as a member of the tribunal than would otherwise be the case.\"34\n\nProposal, para. 40; Observations, para. 63.\n\nProposal, para. 42 (referring to ICCA, \"Report of the ASIL-ICCA Joint Task Force on Issue Conflicts in Investor-State Arbitration\", in ICCA Reports No. 3, March 17, 2016 (the \"**ASIL-ICCA Report**\") (**R-006**), para. 34).\n\nProposal, paras. 42-43.\n\nProposal, para. 39 (citing *OPIC Karimum Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/14, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Professor Phillippe Sands, Arbitrator, May 5, 2011 (\"***OPIC***\") (**R-003**), para. 47).\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that Prof. Douglas' multiple appointments by Respondent States and his current service as a State-appointed arbitrator in a related case would cause any reasonable third party observer to conclude that Professor Douglas manifestly lacks the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.35\n\nProposal, para. 44.\n\n***(3) The Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Veeder***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants' Proposal for the disqualification of Mr. Veeder alleges that he manifestly lacks the qualities required by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention36 for two reasons, namely: (i) multiple arbitrator appointments of Mr. Veeder by the firm of Baker & McKenzie LLP (representing the Respondent in this arbitration) in several ICSID cases; and (ii) because Mr. Veeder served with Prof. Douglas on other ICSID tribunals.37\n\nProposal, para. 45.\n\nProposal, para. 46.\n\n47.\n\nAs to the first point, the Claimants identify two concluded ICSID cases in which the Claimants allege Mr. Veeder was appointed by Baker & McKenzie LLP *i.e.*, *Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A. and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3) (\"***Gemplus***\") and *Talsud, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/4) (\"***Talsud***\").38\n\nProposal, para. 46.\n\n48.\n\nOn the second point, the Claimants assert that Mr. Veeder served as arbitrator with Prof. Douglas in three ICSID cases: (i) *Mercer International, Inc. v. Canada* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3) (\"***Mercer***\"); (ii) *Orange SA v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/10) (\"***Orange SA***\"); and (iii) *Koch Minerals S\u00e0rl and Koch Nitrogen International S\u00e0rl v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/19) (\"***Koch***\").39\n\nProposal, para. 46.\n\n49.\n\nIn their Observations, the Claimants allege that Mr. Veeder failed to disclose other \"relations with the respondents' legal counsels\" and other professional or educational interactions with Prof. Douglas.40 With regard to the former, the Claimants allege that: (i) one of the Respondent's counsel, Mr. Poulton, and Mr. Veeder are both in the Law Society of England and Wales; (ii) another member of Respondent's counsel team, Ms. Finkel is in Essex Court Chambers with Mr. Veeder, was working at King's College London when Mr. Veeder was a visiting professor, and was an arbitrator in the Skadden Arps FDI moot court competition in 2011, when Mr. Veeder was also an arbitrator in that competition.41 The Claimants also note that Mr. Veeder and Prof. Douglas were both in Jesus College at Cambridge University but do not mention the relevant dates in this regard.42\n\nObservations, para. 74.\n\nObservations, para. 74.\n\nObservations, para. 74.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Mr. Veeder intentionally failed to disclose his prior appointments by Baker & McKenzie LLP and his prior work with Prof. Douglas. They argue that paragraph 3.3.8 of the IBA Guidelines applies to investment treaty arbitration and required Mr. Veeder to disclose such information.43\n\nProposal, paras. 47-48; Observations, paras. 78-79. The relevant section of the IBA Guidelines require disclosure where: \"[t]he arbitrator has, within the past three years, been appointed on more than three occasions by the same counsel, or the same law firm.\"\n\n51.\n\nTo support their conclusion, the Claimants refer to the proposal to disqualify Prof. Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a in *Burlington* which discusses multiple appointments of Prof. Vicu\u00f1a by the firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.44 In the Claimants' view, this case established that there is a material risk that an arbitrator may be influenced by external factors where there is \"excessive dependence on\" the firm which appointed the arbitrator and a significant overlap in facts and parties.45\n\nProposal, para. 50 (referring to *Burlington*).\n\nProposal, para. 50.\n\n52.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants compare *Burlington* and the present case, asserting that the two cases concerned similarly-worded treaty provisions, and the same conduct by the State consisting in \"a series of actions purportedly taken by the Respondent to delay and disrupt the regular progress of the works [\u2026].\"46\n\nProposal, para. 50.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Mr. Veeder's repeat appointments by Baker & McKenzie LLP, together with his \"defective\" disclosure, would raise justifiable doubts in the mind of an informed third party concerning his reliability to exercise independent judgment. The Claimants submit that this would justify his disqualification pursuant to Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.47\n\nProposal, para. 49.\n\n***(4) The Respondent's Request for Costs***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants did not request their costs incurred in connection with their Proposal. The Claimants also argue that the Respondent's request for its costs is frivolous and abusive.48 Consequently, the Claimants request that the Chairman dismiss the Respondent's request for costs.49\n\nObservations, para. 55.\n\nObservations, sec. VIII.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent's response to the Claimants' Proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder was set forth in its submission of November 6, 2019. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n***(1) Relevant Legal Standard***\n---------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent accepts the Claimants' submission that the term \"independent judgment\" in Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention includes both impartiality and independence.50 It also agrees that the test for this requirement is an objective one, based on a reasonable evaluation by an informed third party.51 Further, the Respondent accepts that there is no requirement to prove actual dependence or bias, although it emphasizes that Art. 57 of the ICSID Convention requires that \"the lack of impartiality or independence must appear to an informed third party to be manifest.\"52 In support, the Respondent cites the *Urbaser* case.53 The Respondent further notes the decision on the challenge to Prof. Philippe Sands in *OPIC* stating that:\n\nThere thus exists a relatively high burden for those seeking to challenge ICSID arbitrators. The Convention's requirement that the lack of independence be \"manifest\" necessitates that this lack be clearly and objectively established. Accordingly, it is not sufficient to show an appearance of a lack of impartiality or independence.54(Emphasis in original)\n\nResponse, para. 5.5 (referring to Proposal, para. 17).\n\nResponse, para. 5.2 (referring to Proposal, para. 18).\n\nResponse, paras. 5.2, 5.5-5.6 (referring to Proposal, paras. 17-20).\n\nResponse, paras. 5.5-5.6 (citing *Urbaser* (**R-001**), paras. 34, 43).\n\nResponse, para. 5.7 (citing *OPIC* (**R-003**)*,* para. 45).\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the *Raiffeisen* case, on which the Claimants' rely, stating:\n\nThe legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an 'objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.' As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.55 (Emphasis in original)\n\nResponse, para. 5.8 (citing *Raiffeisen* (**R-009**), para. 84).\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the mere fact of repeat appointments is insufficient, in and of itself, to establish a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.56 In this regard, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' reliance on the *Tidewater*, *Elitech*, *OPIC* and *Caratube* cases.\n\nResponse, para. 5.11.\n\n59.\n\nFirst, the Respondent disputes the Claimants' reliance on the *Tidewater* case to establish that multiple appointments by the same party give rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality if combined with other factors.57 The Respondent clarifies that in *Tidewater*, the \"arbitrators' measured view was that a 'potential' conflict 'may' arise if multiple appointments were accompanied with other objective circumstances where, together, these gave rise to a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\"58 The *Tidewater* arbitrators elaborated a cautious approach to disqualification based on multiple appointments by the same party.59 In rejecting the proposal to disqualify the challenged arbitrator in *Tidewater*, the arbitrators found that the mere fact of being named in three other cases by the same party did not, without more, indicate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality on her part.60\n\nResponse, para. 5.12 (referring to Proposal, para. 20).\n\nResponse, para. 5.13.\n\nResponse, para. 5.13 (citing *Tidewater* (**R-002**), paras. 63-64.\n\nResponse, para. 5.14 (citing *Tidewater* (**R-002**), para. 64).\n\n60.\n\nSecond, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' arguments based on *Elitech*. According to the Respondent, *Elitech* rejects the view that the existence of repeat appointments by the same party or their legal counsel is, in and of itself, a reason to question the independence or impartiality of an arbitrator.61 According to the Respondent, the *Elitech* case also sets a high standard for the other circumstances that must be present for a disqualification proposal to succeed under the ICSID Convention.62\n\nResponse, paras. 5.15-5.17 (citing *Elitech* (**R-008**), paras. 12, 18(ii), 50, 52, 54).\n\nResponse, para. 5.17.\n\n61.\n\nThird, the Respondent takes issue with the Claimants' reliance on the *OPIC* case. In the Respondent's view, although the arbitrators in *OPIC* disagreed with the finding in the *Tidewater* case by holding that the mere fact of multiple appointments by the same party is *not* neutral,63 arbitrators before and after the *OPIC* decision have \"taken a strikingly different approach.\"64 In any event, the Respondent argues, the *OPIC* decision does not assist the Claimants. In all three cases cited (*Tidewater*, *Elitech* and *OPIC*), the disqualification proposal was dismissed, despite repeat appointments by the same party and certain overlaps between cases.65\n\nResponse, para. 5.18 (citing *OPIC* (**R-003**), para. 47).\n\nResponse, para. 5.19.\n\nResponse, para. 5.19.\n\n62.\n\nIn the Respondent's submission, a finding of manifest lack of independence and impartiality arising from multiple appointments by the same party (or the same legal counsel), requires a significant overlap in the factual and legal issues in the cases.66\n\nResponse, para. 5.20.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its approach is consistent with paragraph 3.1.3 of the IBA Guidelines, requiring disclosure if: \"[t]he arbitrator has, within the past three years, been appointed as arbitrator on two or more occasions by one of the parties, or an affiliate of one of the parties.\"67\n\nResponse, para. 5.21 (citing IBA Guidelines (**R-005**), para. 3.1.3).\n\n64.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent concludes that it is not sufficient for there to have been multiple appointments by the same party and some overlap in the relevant cases. The Respondent submits that the threshold is a high one and past ICSID decisions on this issue have demonstrated that the following additional circumstances do not give rise to a disqualification: (i) the arbitrator was appointed several times by the same party or same legal counsel; (ii) the arbitrator was appointed in \"parallel\" cases where disputes arose out of the same treaty; and (iii) the arbitrator was appointed by the same party in a related case.68 The Respondent notes that this high threshold has only been met in one case on which the Claimants rely, *Caratube*.69\n\nResponse, para. 5.22 (referring to *Elitech* (**R-008**), para. 54).\n\nResponse, para. 5.23.\n\n65.\n\nFourth, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' reliance on the *Caratube* case. Although the challenged arbitrator in *Caratube* was disqualified, the case applies a very high threshold to the meaning of \"significant overlap\" between cases in which an arbitrator has been appointed by the same party.70 The Respondent states that the *Caratube* case involved \"(a) a clear finding that the fact of multiple appointments does not give rise to apparent bias or dependence; and (b) a significant overlap in both underlying facts and the relevance of these facts for the determination of the legal issues in the other arbitration.\"71 As a result, the Respondent concludes that the circumstances of the *Caratube* case \"could not be further removed from the present matter.\"72\n\nResponse, para. 5.23.\n\nResponse, para. 5.27.\n\nResponse, paras. 5.24-5.27.\n\n***(2) The Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Douglas***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent addresses arguments raised by the Claimants concerning: (i) Prof. Douglas' involvement as arbitrator in other ICSID proceedings; and (ii) Prof. Douglas' arbitrator appointment history.\n\n**a. Other ICSID Proceedings**\n------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent makes two arguments with respect to the Claimants' assertion that Prof. Douglas manifestly lacks independence because he presently serves as an arbitrator appointed by Kuwait in the *Rizzani* case.\n\n68.\n\nFirst, the Respondent asserts that Prof. Douglas has not been appointed multiple times in ICSID proceedings by either the Respondent or by its legal counsel.73 According to the Respondent, Prof. Douglas has been appointed as co-arbitrator once by Kuwait in the *Rizzani* case, and by appointment of the Parties in the present case as presiding arbitrator.74\n\nResponse, para. 6.5.\n\nResponse, paras. 3.3 and 6.5.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that even though the Claimants do not dispute that repeat appointments *by the same party* is one of the pre-requisites to alleging a manifest lack of bias on the basis of multiple appointments, the Claimants have not satisfied this requirement in the present case. In the Respondent's view, the Claimants failed to explain how their own proposal of Prof. Douglas to serve as presiding arbitrator by agreement of the Parties constitutes an appointment by the Respondent.75\n\nResponse, para. 6.5(b).\n\n70.\n\nFurther, the Respondent observes that Prof. Douglas was appointed to serve as arbitrator in the *Rizzani* case on June 7, 2017, two years before the present case commenced, and that his appointment was a matter of public record. As a result, the Claimants may not claim that they were unaware of Prof. Douglas' appointment in the *Rizzani* case before they proposed him as presiding arbitrator in this case on September 16, 2019.76\n\nResponse, para. 6.5(c).\n\n71.\n\nSecond, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' arguments that there is significant overlap between the *Rizzani* case and the present case. According to the Respondent, the two cases: (i) involve unrelated projects - while the Claimants' project relates to Heritage Village, the *Rizzani* case relates to the construction of a large highway; (ii) the projects are located in different geographical areas;77(iii) are managed by different government ministries of the Respondent; (iv) involve different parties; and (v) invoke different treaties.78\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(a).\n\nResponse, paras. 3.4 and 6.6.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that the claims arise out of two different contracts, concluded at different times and with different entities. The contract in the present case was concluded with the Ministry of Finance and was for a private sector development of an urban development project. By contrast, the claims in the *Rizzani* case arise out of a contract concluded with the Ministry of Public Works for a joint venture road construction project.79\n\nResponse, paras. 6.7(b) and (c)(ii).\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimants' argument that the two cases are similar because both involve Kuwait.80 The Respondent argues that unlike in the *Caratube* case, there is no relationship between the claimants in the two cases. The present case involves four Egyptian nationals with interests in the Heritage Village Real Estate Company, whereas the claimants in the *Rizzani* case are Italian and Spanish companies.81\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(c) (referring to Proposal, paras. 14 and 25).\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(c)(i).\n\n74.\n\nWith reference to the Claimants' assertion that there is significant overlap because the underlying treaties in both cases are similarly worded, the Respondent observes that the claims in the two cases arise from three different treaties: the Kuwait-Egypt BIT in the present case, and the Kuwait-Italy and Kuwait-Spain BITs in the *Rizzani* case.82 Further, the Respondent argues that past ICSID decisions have found that no significant overlap between cases exists, even if the cases arise out of the same treaty.83\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(d) (referring to Proposal, para. 23).\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(d) (referring to *Elitech,* para. 54).\n\n75.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' assertion that the claims in the two cases relate to events which occurred within the same time frame, *i.e.*, in 2010-2017, the Respondent points out that the contracts were concluded several years apart. The Heritage Village project contract was concluded in 2004 while the *Rizzani* project contract was concluded in 2011.84 In the Respondent's view, the fact that some of the conduct complained of occurred \"in part\" within the same seven-year period, \"has no bearing on any assertion that the two cases are similar.\"85\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(e).\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(e).\n\n76.\n\nFinally, the Respondent states that the relevance of the projects being in the same geographical area is not clear, but in any event, they are in different areas. The Claimants' project, Heritage Village, is located on Abdullah Al Ahmed Street, whereas the *Rizzani* case concerns the replacement of the existing Jamal Abdul Nasser Street, stopping short of the Heritage Village site.86\n\nResponse, para. 6.7(f).\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that Kuwait has instructed two different legal counsel to represent it in the two cases. It also underlines that this decision to appoint counsel was taken by Kuwait before the Claimants proposed Prof. Douglas as presiding arbitrator.87\n\nResponse, paras. 6.8-6.9.\n\n78.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent concludes that even if there were multiple appointments by the same party, there is no significant overlap between the present case and the *Rizzani* case. In the Respondent's view:\n\nBy virtue of the different factual matrixes, the conduct complained of arises out of distinct circumstances and any factual determinations in the *Rizzani* case will have no bearing on the present proceedings. Contrary to the circumstances in the *Caratube* case, the claimants in the two cases are not related, there will be no overlap between the evidence that is presented to the Tribunal in either case, and the allegations are made under different contracts and different investment treaties.88\n\nResponse, para. 6.8.\n\n**b. Appointment History**\n--------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is unclear whether the Claimants' allegation that Prof. Douglas manifestly lacks the required independence and impartiality as a result of previous multiple appointments by a State party is a self-standing one or whether it goes toward the general matrix of facts.89 The Respondent contends that, \"[w]hichever the case, the Claimants' submissions on this point are hopeless.\"90\n\nResponse, para. 6.11.\n\nResponse, para. 6.11.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertions with regard to Prof. Douglas' alleged multiple appointments by Respondent States, for three reasons.\n\n81.\n\nFirst, the facts of the *OPIC* case on which the Claimants rely are inapposite to the facts of the present case.91 In *OPIC*, the claimants in that case referred to multiple arbitrator appointments by the same party or their legal counsel, whereas in the present case Prof. Douglas has not been appointed several times by the Respondent or its legal counsel.92\n\nResponse, para. 6.13.\n\nResponse, para. 6.13.\n\n82.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that prior ICSID decisions considering the issue, including those cited by the Claimants, concluded that \"the mere fact of having been appointed multiple times by the same party does not (in and of itself) give rise to a finding of bias.\"93 The Respondent argues that there must be objective circumstances demonstrating that prior arbitrator appointments manifestly influence the arbitrator's ability to exercise independent judgment in the present arbitration.94 According to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to demonstrate any objective circumstances that would lead an informed third party to conclude that prior appointments influenced Prof. Douglas' ability to exercise independent judgment in the present case.95\n\nResponse, para. 6.14.\n\nResponse, para. 6.14.\n\nResponse, para. 6.14.\n\n83.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that it selected Prof. Douglas from the list of individuals proposed by the Claimants for presiding arbitrator because he had the most significant ICSID experience, and not because of his alleged State affiliation. In addition, the Respondent notes that some of the other candidates proposed by the Claimants had only been appointed by Respondent States in ICSID proceedings.96\n\nResponse, paras. 6.15-6.17.\n\n84.\n\nFinally, the Respondent dismisses the Claimants' allegation that a presiding arbitrator requires an elevated level of independence or impartiality. The Respondent states that the ASIL-ICCA Report on which the Claimants rely in this regard, confirms that all arbitrators are subject to the same obligations of impartiality and independence.97\n\nResponse, paras. 6.18-6.20 (citing the ASIL-ICCA Report (**R-006**), para. 35).\n\n***(3) The Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Veeder***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' arguments regarding their Proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder.98 The Respondent's arguments are summarized below.\n\nResponse, para. 7.2.\n\n86.\n\nFirst, the Respondent clarifies that the two cases involving Baker & McKenzie LLP, *Gemplus* and *Talsud*, were joined (*i.e.*, *de facto* consolidated), and that Mr. Veeder was appointed as presiding arbitrator by agreement of the parties in those joined cases, and not solely by Baker & McKenzie LLP.99 The Respondent further notes that *Gemplus* and *Talsud* resulted in the issuance of an award in 2010, almost 10 years ago.100\n\nResponse, paras. 3.6 and 7.3.\n\nResponse, para. 3.6.\n\n87.\n\nSecond, the Respondent explains that even if Mr. Veeder's appointments were considered appointments by Baker & McKenzie LLP alone, these would still only be two prior appointments occurring more than three years ago. As such, no disclosure would be required under the IBA Guidelines, should these be applicable.101\n\nResponse, para. 7.4.\n\n88.\n\nThird, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertions that Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder having served together on the same arbitral tribunal in past ICSID cases would affect their impartiality and independence. In the Respondent's view, the suggestion that Mr. Veeder cannot form an independent view because he sat on a tribunal with Prof. Douglas in the past is untenable.102\n\nResponse, paras. 3.7 and 7.5.\n\n***(4) The Respondent's Request for Costs***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Chairman ought to order the Claimants to pay its legal costs of dealing with the challenge \"because this process is plainly a waste of resources.\"103\n\nResponse, para. 8.1(b).\n\n**C. The Arbitrators' Explanations**\n------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nProf. Douglas and Mr. Veeder furnished explanations to the Chairman pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n***(1) Prof. Douglas' Explanations***\n-------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nProf. Douglas notes that he was informed that he had been appointed as presiding arbitrator by agreement of the Parties by ICSID's letter of September 27, 2019, and he accepted the appointment on that basis.104\n\nLetter from Prof. Douglas to the Secretary-General dated November 12, 2019, para. 2.\n\n92.\n\nIn Prof. Douglas' view, the correspondence exchanged in this case establishes that he was appointed by agreement of the Parties. Prof. Douglas notes that the Claimants proposed his candidacy on September 16, 2019 and that the Respondent accepted the Claimants' proposal by letter of September 27, 2019. The Claimants subsequently confirmed Prof. Douglas' appointment on September 28, 2019.105\n\nLetter from Prof. Douglas to the Secretary-General dated November 12, 2019, para. 3.\n\n93.\n\nProf. Douglas adds no further explanations, noting that the grounds for disqualification are based on information in the public domain.106 Prof. Douglas confirms that he can be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and to act fairly and impartially as between the Parties in discharging his duties.\n\nLetter from Prof. Douglas to the Secretary-General dated November 12, 2019, para. 4.\n\n***(2) Mr. Veeder's Explanations***\n-----------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nIn his explanations, Mr. Veeder confirms his independence and impartiality as an arbitrator in these proceedings. Mr. Veeder's explanations also address the facts of the five cases referenced in the Proposal, *Gemplus*, *Talsud*, *Orange SA*, *Koch* and *Mercer*.107\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 1.\n\n95.\n\nMr. Veeder states that *Gemplus* and *Talsud* were heard together as one arbitration, and that he was appointed as presiding arbitrator by agreement of the three disputing parties.108 Mr. Veeder notes that the claimants' legal representatives in these cases included the law firm of Baker & McKenzie LLP. Further, these cases concluded on June 18, 2010 upon the issuance of an award. Mr. Veeder clarifies that Prof. Douglas was not involved in these two cases.\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 1.\n\n96.\n\nWith respect to the three previous ICSID cases in which the Claimants allege that Mr. Veeder and Prof. Douglas served together as arbitrators on the same tribunal, Mr. Veeder further notes:\n\na. As regards the first case, *Orange SA*, Mr. Veeder was appointed by agreement of the parties and Prof. Douglas served as one of the co-arbitrators. Baker & McKenzie LLP was not involved in this case. Further, this case was suspended soon after the constitution of the tribunal and was discontinued in 2016 following an amicable settlement between the parties.109\n\nb. In the second case, *Koch*, Mr. Veeder was appointed as presiding arbitrator by agreement of the parties. Prof. Douglas replaced the initial co-arbitrator and the case was partially reheard for the benefit of Prof. Douglas. The tribunal issued its award on October 30, 2017, by a majority, and Prof. Douglas dissented from the award. Again, Baker & McKenzie LLP was not involved in this arbitration.110\n\nc. As regards the third case, *Mercer*, Mr. Veeder notes that he was appointed jointly by the parties as presiding arbitrator. He served with Prof. Douglas on that tribunal which rendered an award on March 6, 2018, with a supplementary decision on December 10, 2018. Baker & McKenzie LLP was not involved in the arbitration.111\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 1.\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 2.\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 2.\n\n97.\n\nMr. Veeder states that, as an arbitrator, he has not hitherto considered it necessary to disclose the participation of a law firm in an arbitration concluded long ago or any prior involvement with a co-arbitrator in earlier arbitration proceedings where he had been a member of the same tribunal.112 Mr. Veeder notes that the full information regarding his involvement as an arbitrator with both Baker & McKenzie LLP and Professor Douglas \"lies in the public record, having been publicly recorded on the ICSID and other websites readily available to any disputing party to an arbitration.\"113\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 2.\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p. 2.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, Mr. Veeder states that he does not consider that the mere participation of a legal representative or arbitrator in previous ICSID cases where he served as an arbitrator affect his independence, impartiality or suitability as an arbitrator in a later arbitration.114\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, pp. 1-2.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nArt. 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\n\n100.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in this provision means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"115 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.116\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Decision on the Parties' Proposals to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, November 12, 2013 (\"***Blue Bank***\") para. 61; *BSG Resources Limited, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) S\u00c0RL v.

Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Second Edition (2009), p. 1202, paras. 134-154.\n\n101.\n\nThe Proposal for the disqualification of Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder alleges that both arbitrators manifestly lack the qualities required by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention and hence should be disqualified under Art. 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n102.\n\nThe required qualities are stated in Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention as follows:\n\nPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n103.\n\nIn this case, the Proposal alleges that Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\n\n104.\n\nWhile the English version of Art. 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"independent judgment,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d'ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions*\" (guaranteed independence in exercising their functions), the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is understood that pursuant to Art. 14(1) arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.117 Indeed, both Parties in this case accept that understanding.118\n\n*Blue Bank*, para. 58; *BSG*, para. 56.\n\n*See above* at paras. 26-29; 56-57.\n\n105.\n\nImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case*.*\"119\n\n*BSG*, para. 57; *Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v.

While rules or guidelines such as these may serve as useful references, the Chairman is bound by the standard in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Arts. 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Analysis of the Proposals**\n--------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nAs indicated above, with respect to the Proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas, the Claimants contend that: (i) Prof. Douglas is presently a co-arbitrator appointed by Kuwait in another ongoing ICSID proceeding, which the Claimants allege is similar to the present case; and (ii) Prof. Douglas has been appointed multiple times by Respondent States.\n\n111.\n\nWith respect to the Proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder, the Claimants allege that: (i) Mr. Veeder has been appointed repeatedly by Baker & McKenzie LLP, the Respondent's counsel in this arbitration; and (ii) Mr. Veeder and Prof. Douglas have served on the same tribunal in past ICSID cases. Each of these points are dealt with below.\n\n***(1) The Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Douglas***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Prof. Douglas' Participation in the** ***Rizzani*** **Case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Prof. Douglas cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment because he presently sits as an arbitrator in *Rizzani v Kuwait*, appointed by Kuwait.124 They argue that there is significant overlap between the facts of the present case and the *Rizzani* case: both disputes arise out of the same industry, relate to projects in the same geographical area, involve the same Respondent State and concern the same type of investment.125 In addition, the Claimants argue that the treaty provisions in the two cases are \"almost identically worded.\"126\n\nProposal, para. 14.\n\nProposal, paras. 14 and 22.\n\nProposal, para. 23.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent replies that Prof. Douglas has not been appointed multiple times by Kuwait (or its legal counsel). To the contrary, Prof. Douglas has been appointed once by Kuwait (*Rizzani*) and jointly by agreement of the Parties in the present arbitration.127 The Respondent submits that there is no relevant factual or legal overlap between the present case and the *Rizzani* case, since the parties to the dispute are different, the treaties and contracts that gave rise to the dispute are different, and the two disputes pertain to unrelated projects in different geographical areas, managed by different State entities of the Respondent.128\n\nResponse, para. 6.5.\n\nResponse, paras. 3.4, 6.6-6.7.\n\n114.\n\nThe Statement attached to Prof. Douglas' Declaration of October 3, 2019, reads as follows:\n\nI confirm that I am currently sitting as an arbitrator in another ICSID case involving the State of Kuwait: *Rizzani de Eccher, OHL & Trevi v State of Kuwait* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/8). This is a matter of public record. I do not consider that this is a circumstance that might cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party but I confirm this fact nonetheless in the interests of full transparency.\n\n115.\n\nThe Chairman agrees with the Respondent's submission that Prof. Douglas has not been appointed multiple times solely by the Respondent.129 As the information on the record makes clear, Prof. Douglas has been appointed once by the State of Kuwait in the *Rizzani* case and jointly by the Parties as presiding arbitrator in the present case. Therefore, the Chairman does not need to address the effect of multiple appointments by the same party.\n\nResponse, para. 6.5.\n\n116.\n\nIn light of the arguments presented by the Claimants, the Chairman must consider whether this case and the *Rizzani* case present common facts or issues that are sufficient to give rise, objectively, to the appearance of lack of independence or impartiality of an arbitrator sitting concurrently on both cases.130\n\n*Universal*, para. 72; *Caratube* (**R-004**) para. 57.\n\n117.\n\nAs a starting point, the decisions in *Tidewater* and *Raiffeisen* are instructive. In *Tidewater*, the unchallenged arbitrators stated that \"multiple appointments as arbitrator by the same party in unrelated cases are neutral, since in each case the arbitrator exercises the same independent function.\"131 In *Raiffeisen*, the Chairman found that \"the same principle applies \u2026 to multiple appointments by different claimants, even if they are in cases against the same respondent.\"132 The same principle must apply in this case as well.\n\n*Tidewater* (**R-002**) para. 60.\n\n*Raiffeisen* (**R-009**) para. 88.\n\n118.\n\nMoreover, as noted in *Raiffeisen*, where a proposal for disqualification rests on consideration of the same issue(s) in multiple arbitrations, there must be an additional significant overlap of facts that are specific to the merits and the parties involved, as was the case in *Caratub* e133 \u2013 a case on which the Claimants heavily rely.\n\n*Raiffeisen* (**R-009**) para. 91.\n\n119.\n\nIn *Caratube*, the unchallenged arbitrators considered whether the participation of the respondent-appointed arbitrator in an UNCITRAL arbitration (*Ruby Roz*) and appointed by the same respondent, would put into question his impartiality and independence due to the similarities between the two cases.134 The unchallenged arbitrators determined that there was a \"significant overlap in the underlying facts\" between *Caratube* and *Ruby Roz.*135 In particular: (i) there was a direct personal and commercial relationship between the claimants in the two cases; (ii) an overlap in the witnesses submitting statements in the two cases; (iii) the *Ruby Roz* tribunal had already formed an opinion as to credibility with respect to some of the witnesses giving evidence in the *Caratube* case; and (iv) in both cases the respective claimants had relied on certain identical factual allegations regarding events underlying state criminal investigations and expropriation of the related claimants and their companies.136 As a result, the unchallenged arbitrators found that a reasonable and informed third party would find it highly likely that the challenged arbitrator would prejudge the legal issues in *Caratube* based on his knowledge of the facts in the *Ruby Roz* case.137\n\n*Caratube* (**R-004**) paras. 71 *et seq*.\n\n*Caratube* (**R-004**) paras. 88-90.\n\n*See* Response, para. 5.25; *Caratube* (**R-004**) paras. 78 *et seq*.\n\n*Caratube* (**R-004**) para. 90.\n\n120.\n\nApplied to the present case, the Chairman notes that there are some commonalities between this arbitration and the *Rizzani* case. In both cases: (i) the responding party is Kuwait; (ii) the investors allege that the dispute arose out of a measure by Kuwait; (iii) the projects arose out of the construction sector;138 and (iv) there are some similarities between the treaties pursuant to which the respective claims have been brought. However, that is where the few commonalities end.\n\n*See* case details on the ICSID website: https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/cases/casedetail.aspx?CaseNo=ARB/19/20 and https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/cases/casedetail.aspx?CaseNo=ARB/17/8\n\n121.\n\nThe overlap of the periods during which the conduct complained of in each case took place, absent more, is of little relevance. Likewise, the fact that the two projects are located in Kuwait City is not relevant. The claimant investors in the two cases are distinct, and there is no evidence that there is any relationship between them. The projects themselves and the contracts governing them are entirely distinct. Although the Claimants suggested that there are \"the same potential witness[es]\" in the two cases,139 they failed to identify any specific individuals who would be potential witnesses. In short, there is no significant overlap in this case such as was found to exist in the *Caratube* case.\n\nObservations, para. 19.\n\n122.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants failed to identify an overlap between the *Rizzani* case and the present arbitration that would be relevant to the consideration of the legal issues in the present dispute. Accordingly, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts alleged and the arguments submitted would not conclude that there is a manifest lack of the qualities required by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**b. Multiple Arbitrator Appointments by States**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that Prof. Douglas has been appointed repeatedly by Respondent States and therefore he manifestly lacks the independence and impartiality required of an arbitrator by Art. 14(1). The Claimants characterize Prof. Douglas as a \"pro-State arbitrator,\" and state that he has been appointed by Respondent States in 44 ICSID cases.140\n\n*See above* at paragraphs 43-45.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that the mere fact of multiple arbitrator appointments by State parties is insufficient, in and of itself, to demonstrate a manifest lack of the qualities in Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. They also argue that no other objective circumstance in this case would support the conclusion that these appointments by State parties undermined Prof. Douglas' ability to exercise independent judgment in the present case.141\n\n*See above* at paragraphs 81-84.\n\n125.\n\nThe Chairman notes that the Parties do not disagree that Prof. Douglas has been appointed repeatedly by States. However, the mere fact that Prof. Douglas has been appointed repeatedly by States is insufficient by itself to establish a manifest lack of independence and impartiality. Rather, there must also be objective circumstances demonstrating that these prior appointments manifestly influence the arbitrator's ability to exercise independent judgment in the arbitration in question. Moreover, a finding that a lack of impartiality or independence is manifest \"must exclude reliance on speculative assumptions or arguments\" and \"the circumstances actually established \u2026 must negate or place in clear doubt the appearance of impartiality.\"142\n\n*Raiffeisen* (**R-009**) para. 88 (citing *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee, October 3, 2001, para. 25).\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants' suggestion that Prof. Douglas will favor Kuwait in this arbitration because he has more frequently been appointed by States is speculation. No evidence has been submitted demonstrating that an informed third-party observer would conclude that Prof. Douglas would favor the Respondent in this arbitration. To the contrary, the fact that the Claimants proposed Prof. Douglas as the presiding arbitrator in the first place, and then re-confirmed their agreement to appoint Prof. Douglas before subsequently calling his appointment into question, significantly undermines the Claimants' arguments.\n\n127.\n\nIn light of the above, the Chairman rejects the Claimants' proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas on this ground.\n\n***(2) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n128.\n\nOn the facts established in this case, whether considered separately or cumulatively, the factors alleged by the Claimants do not satisfy the test required under Art. 57 in relation to repeat appointments by States. Consequently, in the Chairman's view, the combination of the factors alleged by the Claimants do not impugn the independent judgment to be exercised by Prof. Douglas.\n\n129.\n\nThe Chairman finds that the Claimants have not demonstrated that an informed third party would conclude that Prof. Douglas manifestly lacks the qualities required of an arbitrator by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas is rejected.\n\n***(3) The Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Veeder***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Multiple Arbitrator Appointments by the Same Counsel and Other Alleged Relationships with Counsel**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimants propose to disqualify Mr. Veeder due to alleged prior appointments by the Respondent's counsel, Baker & McKenzie LLP, in two ICSID cases concluded in 2010. The Claimants criticize Mr. Veeder for not disclosing these appointments upon acceptance of his appointment, arguing that he was required to do so under the IBA Guidelines. The Respondent argues that no disclosure was required under the IBA Guidelines and that these prior appointments have no impact on Mr. Veeder's independence or impartiality.\n\n131.\n\nAs noted above, the Chairman is bound by Art. 57 of the ICSID Convention and considers any reference to the IBA Guidelines as merely illustrative. With respect to Mr. Veeder's alleged multiple arbitrator appointments by Baker & McKenzie LLP, the Chairman notes that Mr. Veeder was appointed 15 years ago in the consolidated *Gemplus* and *Talsud* cases. The appointments in *Gemplus* and *Talsud* were made by agreement of the parties, only one of which was represented by Baker & McKenzie LLP. An appointment by agreement of the disputing parties which involved Baker & McKenzie LLP as one of the multiple representatives is not an appointment that can be said to have been made by Baker & McKenzie LLP only.\n\n132.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Veeder did not disclose the *Gemplus* and *Talsud* appointments made by party agreement is not inconsistent with the IBA Guidelines. The provision of the IBA Guidelines on which the Claimants rely requires disclosure of appointments by the same law firm \"on more than three occasions\" within the past three years. Here, there are only two relevant appointments, and they were not made by the same law firm. Notably, the Claimants did not challenge these facts in their submissions.\n\n133.\n\nAlthough the Claimants allege that Mr. Veeder ought to also have disclosed certain other \"relations with the respondents' legal counsels\" and other professional or educational interactions with Prof. Douglas,143 they provide no evidence or detail concerning the \"relations\" or interactions they allege, and make no argument as to how they may impact Mr. Veeder's independence and impartiality. At least some of the allegations appear to be misleading, when considered in light of the information on the record. For example, the Claimants allege that one of the Respondent's counsel is \"in Essex Court Chambers,\" but she is in fact a member of the law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP. In any event, the alleged \"relations\" and interactions of Mr. Veeder with members of Respondent's counsel team and Prof. Douglas do not establish a lack of independence and impartiality.\n\n*See above* at paragraph 49.\n\n134.\n\nThe Chairman agrees with Mr. Veeder's assessment that the mere participation of a legal representative or arbitrator in one or more earlier arbitrations where he was also an arbitrator was not a factor affecting his independence, impartiality or suitability as an arbitrator in a later arbitration.144\n\nMr. Veeder's Explanations dated November 3, 2019, p.2.\n\n135.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chairman finds that an informed third party would not conclude that Mr. Veeder manifestly lacks independence and impartiality based on this ground.\n\n**b. Service as Co-Arbitrators on Same Tribunal in Prior ICSID Cases**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants further propose to disqualify Mr. Veeder because he served with Prof. Douglas on the same tribunal in prior ICSID cases.145 The Respondent opposes this and argues that the Claimants have not established that the arbitrators' past service on the same tribunal would objectively give rise to an appearance of lack of independence and impartiality in the present case.146\n\n*See above* at paragraphs 32-42.\n\n*See above* paragraph 88.\n\n137.\n\nThe Chairman notes that the mere fact that Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder sat together on the same tribunal does not indicate that there is a lack of independence or impartiality to decide the issues in the present case. In fact, the information on record demonstrates that Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder have reached different conclusions when sitting together in the *Koch* case. An informed third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of these facts would not conclude that Mr. Veeder manifestly lacks the qualities required by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention because he served with Prof. Douglas in prior ICSID cases.\n\n***(4) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n138.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' arguments, the Chairman concludes that an informed third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts alleged would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required by Art. 14(1) of the ICSID Convention on the part of Mr. Veeder. Accordingly, the Claimants' Proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder is rejected.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n139.\n\nHaving previously stated the conclusions in paragraphs 129 and 138 above, the Claimants' Proposal to disqualify Prof. Douglas and Mr. Veeder is dismissed.\n\n140.\n\nThe allocation of costs incurred in connection with this decision is a matter for determination by the Tribunal in the.course of the arbitration, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1), and the Chairman makes no decision in this regard."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Suspension of Proceedings and on the Procedure with regard to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2020-04-23T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Suspension of Proceedings and on the Procedure with regard to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its previous summary of the parties' positions on the suspension of these proceedings in its letter of 9 April 2020. In summary, the parties were agreed that these proceedings should be suspended due to the difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, but disagreed as to the terms of that suspension.\n\n2.\n\nIn order to resolve this disagreement, the Tribunal, *inter alia,* invited the Claimants to confirm, by 13 April 2020, whether or not they intended to pursue their request for provisional measures before any suspension would take effect and, if so, to explain the urgency of the measures requested. Separately, the Tribunal invited the parties to confirm, by 10 April 2020, whether or not they agreed to extend the deadline for holding the first session for 60 days.\n\n3.\n\nIn their correspondence dated 10 April 2020, the Claimants retracted their position that a suspension of these proceedings was necessary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also refused to extend the deadline for the first session. The Respondent, in its correspondence of 10 April 2020, confirmed its agreement to extend the deadline for the first session.\n\n4.\n\nAs there was no agreement between the parties on the extension of the deadline in ICSID Rule 13(1) for holding the first session, the Tribunal duly held the first session without the parties on the final day of the period specified in Rule 13(1); viz., on 13 April 2020. (The Tribunal records that the Respondent sent a further letter on 13 April 2020 calling for the Tribunal to extend the deadline for the first session in view of the lack of agreement of the parties to do the same. Without deciding whether or not the Tribunal has such discretion, the Tribunal notes that the Tribunal received the Respondent's letter after it had already held the first session by telephone conference without the parties as it had foreseen in its letter of 9 April 2020. In any case, the Tribunal will convene a further session with the parties to discuss, *inter alia*, drafts of the first procedural order and the schedule for this arbitration at an appropriate juncture in due course.)\n\n5.\n\nOn 13 April 2020, the Claimants filed a document entitled \"Request for Provisional Measures\". The Tribunal does not understand this to be the Claimants\u2019 definitive request as it is not supported by evidence (the Tribunal indicated that this was a requirement in its letter of 9 April 2020). The Tribunal, moreover, specifically stated in its letter of 9 April 2020 that: *\"For the avoidance of doubt, the Claimants would not be expected to file their detailed request for provisional measures on 13 April but simply explain the urgency of the request so that the Tribunal can make an informed decision about whether or not to suspend the proceedings with immediate effect.\"* The Claimants did, in any case, comply with the Tribunal\u2019s instruction to provide an explanation of the urgency of the request for provisional measures, which is set out at paragraphs 22 to 32 of their document.\n\n6.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, the Respondent, as requested by the Tribunal in its letter of 9 April 2020, filed its observations on the Claimants\u2019 submission on the urgency of its request for provisional measures as well as its submission in support of the immediate suspension of the proceedings.\n\n**II. DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal now has to rule on a narrow issue, which is whether these proceedings should be suspended immediately, as requested by the Respondent, due to the current difficulties it faces in participating in this arbitration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus before a procedure is fixed by the Tribunal to deal with any request for provisional measures made by the Claimants. The Tribunal reiterates that the Claimants had previously requested the suspension of these proceedings but on the condition that the Tribunal ruled upon their request for provisional measures first. That position was withdrawn in the Claimants\u2019 letter of 13 April 2020.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal has the discretion, under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, to decide on \"any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this general power includes the discretion to suspend these arbitral proceedings upon the showing of good cause. In deciding whether or not to exercise this discretion in the present circumstances, the Tribunal will weigh the prejudice that may be suffered by the Claimants in not having its request for provisional measures adjudicated upon immediately against the prejudice that may be suffered by the Respondent in having to defend itself under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This balancing exercise essentially focuses on two issues that the Tribunal anticipated in its letter of 9 April 2020: the urgency of the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures against the severity of the constraints upon the Respondent resulting from governmental policies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine the urgency of the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures first. The Claimants\u2019 request of 13 April 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Request\") is fashioned as seeking *\"to stay of executing the eviction order No 4 of year 2019 issued by the Kuwaiti Authorities till the final settlement of this dispute before the arbitral tribunal*\" (at p. 2). The Tribunal is inhibited to some extent in the review of the Claimants\u2019 Request because the various documents and regulations that are referred to therein are not referenced as exhibits on the record and are not otherwise appended to the Request. Nonetheless, it is clear that the said eviction order is \"Administrative eviction decision No. (4) of 2019\" which was previously appended to the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration as Exhibit C-19 (\"Eviction Order\"). Although the English version of that document does not appear to be dated, both the Claimants in the Request for Arbitration (at p. 8) and the Respondent in its letter of 16 April 2020 have confirmed that the Eviction Order was made on 1 April 2019.\n\n10.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration (at p. 22), the Claimants included a request for an \"interim measure\" to prevent the Respondent from calling on a performance bond that the Claimants say they provided to the Respondent. The Eviction Order was referred to in this context but only as a reason that the Respondent may be likely to call upon the performance bond.\n\n11.\n\nThe first time that the Claimants raised the issue of seeking a provisional measure to prevent the execution of the Eviction Order was by their email of 26 March 2020. It follows that, when the Claimants' request was first made, almost a year had elapsed since the issuance of the Eviction Order. In their Request, the Claimants do not indicate any basis for concluding that the execution of the Eviction Order is now imminent or refer to any change of circumstance that would provide a basis for such conclusion. For its part, the Respondent states in its letter of 16 April 2020 that, *\"[n]o action can be undertaken on the Heritage Village site [in respect of which the Eviction Order was made] during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019\"* due to the lockdown imposed on all non-critical government departments and work. The Respondent references various websites with details of the Government of Kuwait's measures in relation to COVID-19.\n\n12.\n\nOn the basis of this record, the Tribunal must assess the likelihood that the Eviction Order will be executed by the Government of Kuwait imminently or during the period in which the Respondent requests these proceedings to be suspended. The Tribunal considers that it is unlikely that the Eviction Order, which was made more than a year ago on 1 April 2019, will be executed by the Government of Kuwait in the foreseeable future and especially while non-critical government work has been suspended as a result of COVID-19. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal's assessment of the urgency of the Claimants' request at this stage is limited to its determination of the question as to whether the proceedings should be suspended before or after consideration of the Claimants' request and is without prejudice to the Tribunal's ultimate consideration of the Claimants' definitive request for provisional measures if and when it is filed.\n\n13.\n\nTurning to the prejudice that the Respondent may suffer given the constraints presented by the lockdown measures in Kuwait, the Respondent states in its letter of 16 April 2020 that: *\"[O]n 11 March 2020, the Council of Ministers issued a decision to suspend all ministries, government entities, public authorities and institutions as a precautionary measure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain key sectors are exempted. None are relevant to the present dispute.\"*. The Respondent then addresses the impact of these measures on the Department of Legal Advice and Legislation, which is responsible for the administration of this case for the Respondent: \"*[E]mployees of the Department of Legal Advice and Legislation are not allowed to enter into office premises, unless they are one of only eight individuals listed on the emergency team for the sole purpose of reviewing urgent procurement contracts for other ministries which require urgent supplies and services to address the pandemic. During this time, it is also impossible for state employees to liaise with other departments to obtain any information, much of which is still held in physical form. For auditing and accountability purposes, no entity representative is able to respond to a query unless these are addressed in an official form. Responding by email is extremely difficult.\"*\n\n14.\n\nThe Council of Ministers\u2019 decision of 11 March 2020 and the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Circular No. 7 (2020) implementing that decision are not appended to the Respondent\u2019s letter, but the Respondent had undertaken to provide these documents together with certified translations upon the Tribunal\u2019s request (see footnote 3).\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, contest the Respondent\u2019s previous representations about the extent of the government lockdown in Kuwait (see paragraph 11 of their Request).\n\n16.\n\nGiven that this matter is contested, the Tribunal considered that it was appropriate to require the Respondent to provide the official documents detailing the nature and scope of the government lockdown before the Tribunal issued its decision. The Respondent duly complied with that request on 20 April 2020 and the Tribunal was able to confirm that its description of the nature and scope of the lockdown was accurate. In particular, Circular No. 7 (2020) reads:\n\n*The Civil Service Commission would like to inform all government agencies that the Council of Ministers has decided, in its meeting held on Wednesday 11/03/2020, to suspend the work of all government ministries and agencies, and public bodies and institutions as a precautionary measure due to the outbreak of the recent coronavirus fora period of fifteen days - as official public holidays - as from Thursday 12/03/2020 until Thursday 26/03/2020, provided that official working hours shall resume on Sunday 29/03/2020.*\n\n17.\n\nThe government lockdown was extended by the Decision of the Council of Ministers dated 21 March 2020 until 12 April 2020, and then again by the Decision of the Council of Ministers dated 6 April 2020 until 26 April 2020. The Claimants, for their part, sent further documents relating to the lockdown on 20 April 2020. The Tribunal does not consider that these documents contradict the essential position recorded in the official documents referred to above which is that all government work is currently suspended unless it is directed towards maintaining a vital service or coordinating efforts to combat the COVID-19 virus.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the governmental measures referred to above are likely to impose serious constraints on the ability of the Respondent to defend its position in relation to the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures while the current lockdown measures remain in place for the Government of Kuwait. Given that the lockdown has already been extended twice, it seems likely that it will be extended again before it is due to elapse on 26 April 2020.\n\n19.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the lack of urgency of the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures and the constraints that the Respondent is facing due to the lockdown measures in place for the Government of Kuwait that the Respondent\u2019s position should be accommodated in the procedure going forward. The Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that a full suspension of the proceedings is the appropriate way to deal with this situation.\n\n20.\n\nFirst, if the Respondent were to give an undertaking that the Eviction Order will not be enforced without reasonable prior notice being given to the Claimants and the Tribunal, then the Tribunal may be prepared to stay any consideration of the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures.\n\n21.\n\nSecond, if the Respondent is not prepared or able to give such an undertaking, then the Claimants, who maintain they are not inhibited in participating in this arbitration on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, can prepare and file their definitive request for provisional measures with supporting evidence and legal authorities. The Respondent, by that time, may be in a position to respond in full (if the lockdown has been eased to a relevant extent) or in part (in relation to matters for instance that do not require factual investigations). The Tribunal can assess the position with the parties once it is in receipt of the Claimants' definitive request.\n\n22.\n\nThird, the Respondent indicated in letter of 13 April 2020 that it was prepared to hold the first meeting on 20 May 2020. The Respondent thus appears to share the view that at least some aspects of this arbitration can be progressed notwithstanding the governmental lockdown.\n\n**III. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal thus makes the following directions pursuant to its discretion in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention:\n\na. The Respondent shall indicate on or before 1 May 2020 whether it can give an undertaking of the nature referred to in paragraph 20 and on what terms;\n\nb. If an undertaking is given by the Respondent: then the Claimants shall indicate within 24 hours after receipt of the Respondent's communication as to whether or not they are prepared to consent to a stay of any request for provisional measures in light of that undertaking (if they do not consent then the Tribunal will decide whether or not the procedure for dealing with the Claimants' request for provisional measures will be stayed);\n\nc. If an undertaking is not given by the Respondent or the Claimants have rejected it and the Tribunal has resolved that there will be no stay on the basis of the undertaking as provided: then the Claimants shall file their definitive request for provisional measures with supporting evidence and legal authorities on or before 8 May 2020 should they wish to do so;\n\nd. Following receipt of the Claimants\u2019 definitive request for provisional measures, the Respondent shall, within 2 days of receipt, indicate whether it is still constrained in responding to any aspect of that request and the reasons for the same (the Tribunal will then set a timetable for dealing with the Claimants\u2019 request taking any such constraints into account);\n\ne. The Respondent is at liberty to file its submission on whether the Tribunal has discretion to extend the deadline for an application under Rule 41(5) notwithstanding that the Claimants do not consent to any extension of the same (as confirmed by their letter of 20 April 2020) and, if, so, whether that discretion should be exercised in the circumstances. Following receipt of that submission, the Tribunal will establish a timetable for the Claimants to respond;\n\nf. The parties shall indicate their first availability for a telephone conference to discuss the draft Procedural Order No. 1 (which will be circulated once the date of the conference has been confirmed) on or before 1 May 2020 (for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal considers that such telephone conference should take place as soon as possible and need not await the resolution of any of the foregoing matters)."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Joinder Application", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2020-10-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Joinder Application\n-----------------------------------\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 26 June 2020, the Tribunal held a case management meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n5.\n\nFollowing the case management meeting, on 30 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 based on the agreement and discussion with the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006; that the procedural language would be English; and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Transmitted together with Procedural Order No. 1 was a draft procedural timetable, on which the Tribunal requested the Parties' comments by 8 July 2020.\n\n6.\n\nAs instructed by the Tribunal, the Parties submitted their comments on the draft procedural timetable on 8 July 2020. With their comments, the Claimants indicated that they would be making a request for joinder and made proposals for the inclusion of that phase in the procedural timetable.\n\n7.\n\nOn 9 July 2020, counsel for the Claimants submitted a Request for Joinder of Third Party as a Claimant, together with Exhibits A-001 through A-019 (the \"**Joinder Application**,\" or the \"**Application**\") on behalf of Ms. Amal Ibrahim Abdel Hamid (\"**Ms. Abdel Hamid**,\" or the \"**Applicant**\"). On that same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its observations on the Application by 17 July 2020.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 17 July 2020, the Respondent stated, *inter alia*, that it did not consent to the Application and requested to provide a response to the Application by 8 August 2020.\n\n9.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 22 July 2020, the Tribunal issued Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the procedural calendar, including a timetable for the Parties' submissions on the Joinder Application.\n\n10.\n\nFollowing further exchanges between the Parties, by letter of 28 July 2020 sent by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal confirmed the deadlines set forth in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to the procedural calendar, on 8 August 2020, the Respondent filed a Response to the Joinder Application, together with Exhibits 001 through 008 (the \"**Response**\"). On that same date, the Claimants filed observations on the Joinder Application (the \"**Observations**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 8 September 2020, the Applicant filed a Reply to the Parties' Observations on the Joinder Request, together with Exhibit A-022 (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed all the aforementioned submissions and materials in preparing this Decision.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Applicant, Ms. Amal Ibrahim Abdel Hamid, claims to have an interest in these proceedings as the owner of 49% of the shares in \"*The Technical Field Company*\", which in turn \"*owns the portfolio managed by The International Investor Company, which in the time of the HVREC's incorporation formed 80% of HVREC's shares*\".1 HVREC (the Heritage Village Real Estate Company) is a party to the build, operate and transfer contract with the Ministry of Finance of Kuwait signed on 24 November 2004, which is at the heart of this arbitration. It is also claimed that the Applicant is the main creditor and financier of HVREC insofar as she is said to finance \"*the Letter of Guarantee (Performance Bond)*\" in the sum of \"*KD2,050,000*\" pursuant to the said contract.2\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a72.\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a72.\n\n15.\n\nThe Joinder Application was filed on 9 July 2020. The present arbitration proceedings were commenced on 12 June 2019 when the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration. It is undisputed that the Applicant was not identified as a party in the Request for Arbitration and therefore cannot be considered as an existing claimant in these proceedings. This explains the request by the Applicant as a third party to be joined to this arbitration as a claimant.\n\n16.\n\nThere are no specific provisions dealing with the joinder of a third party in the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as the Applicant and the Respondent recognize.3 The Applicant has nonetheless invoked Articles 25, 36 and 44 of the ICSID Convention in support of her Joinder Application.4\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a786; Response, \u00a73.1.\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a73.\n\n17.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention is the core provision of that instrument dealing with the \"*Jurisdiction of the Centre*\". It does not address the joinder of parties. Article 36 addresses the \"*Request for Arbitration*\" and does not address the matter either. Article 44 provides:\n\n*Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.*\n\n18.\n\nArticle 44 certainly envisages that the Tribunal has the power to resolve procedural issues that are not expressly regulated by the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules or any agreement reached by the parties to the dispute. The question is whether the joinder of a third party is a procedural issue in respect of which the Tribunal has full discretionary power.\n\n19.\n\nWhen the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration on 12 June 2019, they purported to accept the Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate contained in Article 10 of the BIT. At that point in time, an arbitration agreement came into existence between the Claimants and the Respondent (this discussion is without prejudice to the Tribunal's adjudication of any jurisdictional objections that it may have to decide in due course). The Applicant is not a party to that arbitration agreement.\n\n20.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules reveal a heightened concern that the precise identities of the parties to the dispute are stipulated in the Request for Arbitration (*see* Article 36(2) and Rule 2(1) respectively). That concern is understandable due to the importance of defining the parties to the dispute and, in the context of investment treaty arbitration, the parties to the arbitration agreement itself.\n\n21.\n\nOnce an arbitration agreement comes into existence and the parties to that agreement have been defined, the arbitral tribunal cannot modify that agreement without the consent of all the parties to that agreement. That is a fundamental principle: a tribunal can interpret and apply an arbitration agreement, but it cannot rewrite or amend it. The joinder of a third party to the arbitration agreement (as a claimant) would undoubtedly constitute a modification to it.\n\n22.\n\nThere are situations where the consent of the parties to the joinder of a third party can be divined from their prior agreement. For instance, if the parties have entered into a contract to govern their relations, they can elect to include specific provisions for dealing with the joinder of a third party to any arbitration commenced on the basis of an arbitration clause in that contract, which the tribunal will then be able to interpret and apply. Likewise, the parties might agree to the application of set of arbitration rules that include particular provisions for dealing with the joinder of a third party.\n\n23.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate in the BIT, which the Claimants accepted by filing their Request for Arbitration on 12 June 2019, contains no specific provisions that would allow this Tribunal to order the joinder of a third party. Nor do the arbitration rules that have been chosen to apply to this arbitration vest this Tribunal with such a power either.\n\n24.\n\nIn these circumstances, the only permissible route to the joinder of the Applicant as a third party that is available is through the express consent of both the Claimants and the Respondent in this arbitration (*i.e.*, all the existing parties to the arbitration agreement). The Claimants have provided that consent,5 whereas the Respondent has declined to do so.6 In the absence of the consent of all the parties, the Tribunal is compelled to reject the Joinder Application.\n\nObservations, \u00a72.\n\nResponse, \u00a71.3.\n\n25.\n\nIt remains for the Tribunal to deal with two subsidiary points raised by the Applicant.\n\n26.\n\nThe Applicant has sought to establish that she qualifies as an investor who has made an investment under the BIT7 and the ICSID Convention8 and that all the requirements for submitting her dispute to ICSID arbitration by reference to the terms of Kuwait's standing offer to arbitrate in the BIT would be satisfied.9 The Applicant may or may not be correct in these submissions (and the Tribunal refrains from expressing any views) but they are not actually germane to the issue that the Tribunal must decide in ruling on the Joinder Application. Even if all the requirements under the BIT and the ICSID Convention could be satisfied by the Applicant as a putative claimant in her own hypothetical arbitration against the Respondent, there must still be a legal basis to join the Applicant as a party to the present arbitration proceedings. As the Tribunal has already stated, there is no such legal basis in the absent of the consent of all parties to the existing arbitration agreement between the Claimants and the Respondent.\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a7\u00a768-74.\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a7\u00a782-90.\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a7\u00a775-81.\n\n27.\n\nThe Applicant has further relied upon the civil procedural law in Kuwait, which in her submission allows the joinder of parties to existing proceedings.10 The position under civil procedural law is, however, irrelevant to these arbitration proceedings for at least two reasons. First, the rules of municipal laws have no application to the procedure of this arbitration, which is regulated by the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Secondly, international arbitration is a creature of consent in the sense that the powers of the tribunal must be traced to the underlying agreement to arbitrate that binds the parties to the dispute. National courts are in an entirely different position as their source of powers is normally a constitutional instrument. It is for this reason that national courts have wider-ranging powers over third parties in any litigation: those powers are not dependent upon the common denominator of consent of the existing parties to the same litigation.\n\nJoinder Application, \u00a7\u00a791-92.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n28.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal rejects the Joinder Application."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2021-02-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 12 June 2019, Ayat Nizar Raja Sumrain (the \"**First Claimant**\"), Eshraka Nizar Raja Sumrain (the \"**Second Claimant**\"), Alaa Nizar Raja Sumrain (the \"**Third Claimant**\"), and Mohamed Nizar Raja Sumrain (the \"**Fourth Claimant**\") (together, the \"**Claimants**\"), filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") a Request for Arbitration against the State of Kuwait (\"**Kuwait**\" or the \"**Respondent**\") on the basis of the Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of the State of Kuwait (the \"**Kuwait-Egypt BIT**\"). The ICSID Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration on 30 June 2019.\n\n2.\n\nFollowing a first session held on 13 April 2020 and a case management meeting held on 26 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") on 30 June 2020. Annex A to PO1 sets forth the procedural calendar, including a separate briefing schedule for a potential request for bifurcation. Annex A was modified by agreement of the Parties on 22 July 2020 and further modified by the Parties' agreements of 6 and 28 October 2020.\n\n3.\n\nPursuant to the procedural calendar, on 10 December 2020, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits (the \"**Memorial**\"), together with: (i) the Witness Statement of Ayat Nizar Raja Sumrain dated 10 December 2020; (ii) the Expert Report of Steve Harris and Glenn Brill of FTI Consulting dated 10 December 2020, with Appendices 1 through 10 and Exhibits FTI-001 through FTI-0077; and (iii) Exhibits C-0001 through C-0260 and Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0054.\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 January 2021, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Request**\"), together with: Exhibits R-0001 through R-0005 and Legal Authorities RL-0001 through RL-0048.\n\n5.\n\nOn 21 January 2021, the Claimants filed a Reply to Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Reply**\"), together with: Exhibit C-0261 and Legal Authorities CL-0055 through CL-0070.\n\n**II. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S REQUEST FOR BIRFURCATION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent has requested that five objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and/or the admissibility of the Claimants' claims be determined in a preliminary phase of these proceedings, with a hearing scheduled for 18-19 May 2021 for this purpose.\n\n7.\n\nThose five objections, as formulated by the Respondent in its Request, are as follows:\n\na. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* because the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of proving that they validly hold Egyptian nationality (\"**First Objection**\");\n\nb. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they have made an investment under the Kuwait-Egypt BIT and the ICSID Convention (\"**Second Objection**\");\n\nc. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and/or the Claimants have committed an abuse of process because the Claimants made their alleged investments after their claims and/or the dispute arose (\"**Third Objection**\");\n\nd. The Claimants' claims are inadmissible because as shareholders of Heritage Village Real Estate Company (\"**HVREC**\") they have no rights to the Heritage Village Project (\"**Project**\") or rights under the Build Operate and Transfer contract entered into between HVREC and the Ministry of Finance of Kuwait dated 24 November 2004 (\"**Contract**\") and/or the claims are purely contractual and/or there is an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Contract in favour of the Kuwaiti courts (\"**Fourth Objection**\"); and\n\ne. The Claimants have failed to comply with the pre-conditions to jurisdiction in Article 10 of the Kuwait-Egypt BIT (written notification and six-month period to pursue amicable settlement) (\"**Fifth Objection**\").\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Test for Bifurcation**\n-------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal has a broad discretion under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to order the determination of certain preliminary objections in a separate or bifurcated phase of the arbiration.\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties have also cited various cases in which certain criteria have been enumerated for ruling upon an application for birfurcation. The test in *Philip Morris v. Australia* appears to be among the more prominent examples, and it sets out three criteria:\n\n1) Is the objection *prima facie* serious and substantial?\n\n2) Can the objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits?\n\n3) Could the objection, if successful, dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised?1\n\nRL-0036, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, 14 April 2014 (\"*Philip Morris*\"), \u00a7109.\n\n10.\n\nThere is a risk that a test, which is formulated to meet the exigencies of one case, becomes a box-ticking exercise in other cases when divorced from its original context.\n\n11.\n\nThe first limb of the test\u2014\"*whether the objection is prima facie serious and substantial*\" *\u2014* may be problematic. What exactly is the threshold that is envisaged by such a formulation? It is not helpful in this respect that the *Philip Morris* tribunal went on to apply a different standard to the one it had formulated at the outset (\"*The Tribunal cannot prima facie exclude that this Objection might be successful.*\"2) Nor is it helpful that some subsequent tribunals have interpreted *\"prima facie serious and substantial\"* to mean \"*not frivolous or vexatious*\",3 whereas others have nailed their colours to the notion that \"*a higher threshold must be applied than merely requiring that the objection is not frivolous or vexatious*\".4\n\nRL-0036, *Philip Morris*, \u00a7\u00a7111, 119, 125.\n\nE.g., *Carlos Sastre and others v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/2, Procedural Order No. 2, 13 August 2020, \u00a7\u00a739-40; available at: https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw11833.pdf.\n\nE.g., RL-0047, *Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 June 2018, \u00a751.\n\n12.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Tribunal has misgivings about any test that would require labelling a particular objection relating to its jurisdiction or the admissibility of claims as \"*frivolous or vexatious*\" at this early stage (which would follow by implication if bifurcation is not ordered) when the Parties' submissions on the substantive issues are limited to the Claimants' Memorial, the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation and the Claimants' Reply. It is by no means inconceivable that perceptions as to the merits of an objection presented for bifurcation may shift considerably by the time it is actually pleaded and heard by a tribunal: particularly negative labels should be avoided in this context as the risk of at least the appearance of prejudgment is not insignificant.\n\n13.\n\nNor, at the other end of the spectrum, would it be appropriate to apply a threshold as high as \"*more likely than not to succeed*\": that would be tantamount to giving a preliminary ruling on the very substance of the objection, which would be manifestly inappropriate in a procedural decision on bifurcation.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a party requesting the determination of an objection to its jurisdiction or the admissibility of claims (or other issue) in a preliminary phase of the arbitration must demonstrate that such an objection raises a serious issue to be determined on the basis of the materials currently before the tribunal. This test is not a surogate for a bare assessment of the merits of the objection: for example, a serious issue may arise because it is an entirely novel point of law such that no guidance is available in the existing jurisprudence; whereas the absence of a serious issue to be determined may follow the inability of the party to make good certain factual allegations at the preliminary stage in support of the objection, even though it is quite conceivable that this might be rectified later in the proceedings.\n\n15.\n\nThe test in *Philip Morris* also makes no distinction between issues of jurisdiction, on the one hand, and all other issues that do not call into question the adjudicative authority of the tribunal (admissibility, liability and quantum), on the other.5 That does not seem to be appropriate: there are by definition more compelling reasons for a tribunal to establish if it has adjudicative authority at all before it exercises that authority over the dispute in its entirety. There is no doubt that a tribunal has the power, on the basis of competence-competence, to adjudicate upon objections to its jurisdiction. The question is rather at what stage of the proceedings the tribunal should exercise this power of competence-competence. If a tribunal reserves its decision on jurisdiction until after a full examination of the merits of the case, then the tribunal will be acting throughout the proceedings on the assumption that it does have jurisdiction\u2014every step that the tribunal takes in the arbitration presupposes that is properly vested with adjudicative authority over the parties and their dispute on the basis of a valid reference to arbitration. The same issue does not arise in respect of questions relating to admissibility, liability or quantum. The Tribunal is not advocating for a presumption that jurisdictional objections should be decided in a preliminary phase of the arbitration; it is simply opining that it is a relevant factor to take into consideration.\n\nThis was not an oversight: the tribunal in stated that \"*at least for the issue of bifurcation, it does not matter whether the* [objection] *is characterized as going to jurisdiction or admissibility*\"; RL-0036, *Philip Morris*, \u00a7118.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus consider whether it is fair and expedient to order that certain objections be determined in a preliminary phase of this arbitration by reference to the following factors:\n\na. Does the objection raise a serious issue to be determined on the basis of the materials currently before the Tribunal?\n\nb. Does the objection raise an issue of jurisdiction as opposed to admissibility, liability or quantum?\n\nc. If the objection is upheld, will this lead to the termination of the proceedings in their entirety or in significant part?\n\nd. In ruling upon the objection, will it be necessary to consider issues that are intertwined with liability and/or quantum such that any potential savings in time and costs will not be consequential?\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that adjudicating upon a request for bifurcation should not presage a mini-trial on the merits of the prospective objections; it is an application that should be decided without excessive delays and unreasonable costs. The Parties are to be commended in this case by agreeing to a tight schedule both for their own submissions and for the Tribunal\u2019s decision, which fell due within a week of the Claimants\u2019 Reply.\n\n**B. The First Objection**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Claimants have failed to \"*discharge* [] *their burden of proving that they were Egyptian nationals at the relevant points in time*\".6\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.10.\n\n19.\n\nIf the Respondent were to succeed in demonstrating that the Claimants were not Egyptian nationals at the relevant points in time, then that would put an end to these proceedings as the Tribunal would be without jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the Kuwait-Egypt BIT. Moreover, questions of nationality are separate from issues relating to the merits and hence there would be no difficulty in determining this objection in a preliminary and bifurcated phase. The question is whether the Respondent has demonstrated that there is a serious issue to be determined in respect of this objection based on the materials available at this stage.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Claimants have the burden of proving that they were Egyptian nationals both at the date of the breach of the treaty obligations forming the basis of their claims and continuously thereafter until they filed their Request for Arbitration. The Claimants have relied upon copies of their Egyptian naturalization certificates and current Egyptian passports for this purpose. The question of nationality under the BIT and the ICSID Convention is governed by international law because what is at stake is access to a dispute resolution mechanism established by treaty, but there is a renvoi to national law in resolving this question even if existing status under national law is not conclusive in this context. Official documents issued by the responsible national authorities do raise a presumption before an international tribunal that nationality has been validly conferred upon the individuals concerned. The Claimants argue that once tendered before the Tribunal, the burden then shifts to the other party to rebut that presumption and establish why they should not be accorded deference in applying the test for nationality under the applicable treaty.\n\n21.\n\nIn setting out its preliminary case on this objection, the Respondent makes three points. First, it says that an \"*Egyptian national is required to obtain approval from the Minister of Interior before acquiring another foreign nationality*\" and it points to the Egyptian Nationality Law No. 26/1975 and its amendment Law No. 154/2004 in this context,7 but it does not cite to any particular provision. The Claimants reply to this argument by noting that Article 10 of the said law, which contains a requirement for prior approval from the Egyptian Minister of the Interior, applies to Egyptian nationals seeking to be naturalized as nationals of foreign countries and thus not to the situation concerning the Claimants, who say they were nationals of Jordan and Canada before obtaining Egyptian nationality in 2005.8 Based upon the materials currently before the Tribunal, it cannot be said that there is a serious issue to be determined in relation to this part of the objection.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.12 (emphasis in original). *See* C-0261, Arab Republic of Egypt, Law No. 26/1975 dated 29 May 1975; C-0014, Arab Republic of Egypt, Law No. 154/2004 (excerpts) in force as of 15 July 2004.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a724.\n\n22.\n\nSecond, the Respondent says that Egyptian nationality may be withdrawn if it was acquired by fraud or based on false information.9 The Claimants note that, under Egyptian law, the time limit for revoking nationality on this basis expired more than five years ago.10 (The relevance of this time limit for the question of whether a particular nationality is opposable to a State for the purposes of the test under the applicable treaties is not germane to the disposal of the present application and the Tribunal leaves it to one side.) The Respondent has advanced two points of \"concern\" at this stage: (i) the Claimants were children when they purported to obtain Canadian citizenship based upon their investments in Canada; and (ii) the Egyptian ministerial decrees alleged to have granted the Claimants Egyptian nationality do not mention that the Claimants had Canadian citizenship in addition to Jordanian citizenship.11 As the Claimants\u2019 Canadian citizenship is not in issue, the Tribunal does not presently understand the relevance of the first point. As to the second point, the Respondent states that this is \"*particularly material where the forms require the applicant to disclose the nationality s/he holds at the time of application*\". But there is no citation to the forms in question or any analysis of the legal consequences for such an alleged omission under Egyptian law. These omissions may or may not be rectified in due course but the Tribunal cannot, at this stage, conclude that there is a serious issue to be determined on this basis.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.12.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a725.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.13.\n\n23.\n\nThird, the Respondent has taken issue with the Claimants' reliance upon scanned copies of their naturalization cetificates, which \"*are not valid evidence of their nationality*\"  \"*unless they are legalised originals*\".12 The Claimants, in response, have invited the Respondent to \"*inspect the originals at its convenience*\" and enclosed a copy of Ayat Sumrain's original certificate of naturalization as certified by the Consul of the Egyptian Consulate in Kuwait (with the offer of producing certified copies for the other Claimants).13 The Claimants thus appear to have answered the Respondent's concern about the authenticity of the documents in question and, at this stage, there is no serious issue to be determined.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.14.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a726.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal declines to order the bifurcation of the First Objection.\n\n**C. The Second Objection**\n---------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants have not made an investment in accordance with the terms of Article 1 of the BIT or Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent's principal argument is that the Claimants have not paid consideration for their shares in HVREC and/or Thimar Kuwait Holding Company (\"**Thimar**\") and thus cannot demonstrate that they have made a contribution or have assumed any risk, which the Respondent maintains are essential elements for a qualifying investment under the treaties. The Respondent highlights the fact that the share acquisitions by the Claimants were made on the basis of loans provided by the Claimants' mother or the First Claimant, which are payable only on demand and do not envisage the payment of interest.14 The Claimants maintain that direct contibutions were made15 and, in any event, as a matter of law, it is not necessary for the Claimants to make personal contributions in order to have a qualifying investment under the BIT or the ICSID Convention.16\n\nR's Request, \u00a7\u00a73.34-3.36.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a729.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a731.\n\n26.\n\nThe question of law raised by this Second Objection is whether a contribution by the Claimants themselves is required at the time they acquired their shares. (The Respondent does not currently challenge the fact that contributions were originally made by the Claimants\u2019 mother in relation to the Project.)17 The jurisprudence appears to be divided on this issue. On the one hand, some decisions have interpreted the text of the relevant investment treaty to require an \"active contribution\" from the claimant investor; whereas other decisions deny that this is a requirement and point to the ramifications of such an approach: it would mean that an investment acquired by an individual as a gift or through inheritance from a family member, for example, would be deprived of protection upon the transfer. It is not the time or place for the Tribunal to attempt to resolve this legal issue now but it is bound to acknowledge that it is a serious one.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.49; Cs' Reply, \u00a728.\n\n27.\n\nDepending on how that question of law is resolved, the factual issue is whether the Claimants have personally advanced consideration for their shares in HVREC and/or Thimar (or personally advanced funds for increases in capital), even if there is no serious challenge at this stage to the fact that they acquired legal title to the shares. The Claimants\u2019 argument that the Claimants have made other contributions by taking on different roles in relation to the Project (e.g., as architect, chief financial officer, marketing and public relations manager, and so on)18 does not, at this stage, appear to be relevant unless those contributions resulted in the acquisition of assets in the Project that would otherwise come within the definition in Article 1 of the BIT.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a729.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent raises two other points. The first rests upon its observation that \"*the share transfer slips record the relevant share acquisitions at an undervalue compared to the loan agreements*\";19 the Respondent maintains that \"[i]*t is necessary to examine the documentation provided by the Claimants under Kuwaiti law to determine whether this inconsistency is in fact a breach of applicable laws, intended to conceal the true value and/or nature of the transactions from relevant Kuwaiti state authorities.*\"20 There is no particularization as to which laws may be at issue and why. On the basis of this bare allegation, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the Respondent\u2019s position that the transactions \"*are an unenforceable sham from a Kuwaiti law perspective*\"21 raises a serious issue to be determined at this stage.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.44.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.45.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.45.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second point is its submission that the Claimants do not \"*own*\" or \"*have a majority interest*\" in the Project, or HVREC or Thimar.22 According to the Respondent, even if the Claimants own the shares that they say they own, it still only amounts to a 49% interest in HVREC (and the same applies to Thimar). The Respondent provides a chart setting out the alleged shareholdings.23 The Claimants have responded to this point simply with the assertion that \"[t]*he Claimants hold (directly or indirectly) 70.9% of HVREC\u2019s shares*\".24 No reference or further elaboration is provided. The difference between the Parties appears to be that the Claimants, to use the Respondent\u2019s expression, \"*amalgamate all of their shareholdings*\"25 to reach their 70.9% figure.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.46\n\nR's Request, \u00a7\u00a73.47-3.48.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a733.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.48.\n\n30.\n\nThe reason that this is potentially significant is that Article 1(1) of the BIT provides that \"[t]*he term \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of asset located in a Contracting State and that an investor of the other Contracting State owns, or has a majority interest in*,*directly or indirectly*...\". Article 1(1) goes on to provide that \"[t]*his term includes, in particular, but is not limited to... (b) a company or commercial enterprise or joint venture, or stakes, or shares, and other forms of equity participation*...\".26\n\nCL-0012, Kuwait-Egypt BIT.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants say that their investments consist of shares in HVREC and rights in the Project (which are directly held by HVREC under its Contract (and the Addendum to the Contract dated December 2014)).27 The Respondent appears to be raising the question as to whether it is necessary for the Claimants to demonstrate that they have a \"*majority interest*\" in HVREC (directly or indirectly) in order to claim the Project rights as their indirect investment.28 The Tribunal considers that this is a serious issue to be determined.\n\nCs' Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7186-188.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.48.\n\n32.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Second Objection, relating to the existence of a qualifying investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, is a threshold jurisdictional question and hence the particular sensitivities that have already been discussed in relation to such objections apply.\n\n33.\n\nAlthough the arguments for and against bifurcation are finely balanced, the Tribunal considers that a ruling on this objection as a preliminary issue would be fair and expedient in all the circumstances. Certain factual issues would be raised by this Second Objection but they would be limited in scope and would not overlap with the merits. If the objection were to be upheld in relation to all Claimants, then it would effectively dispose of the case, thus saving both Parties significant resources. But even if the objection were not upheld or upheld partially in respect of some but not all of the Claimants, then it would still be beneficial to have clarity at an early stage as to the nature and scope of the investments as this may assist in narrowing the issues for the subsequent consideration of the merits (and possibly quantum). This is reinforced in connection with the Tribunal's consideration of the Third Objection, to which it will now turn.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal has thus resolved to adjudicate upon this Second Objection in a preliminary phase save in respect of the Respondent's allegation of illegality in relation to the acquisition of the investments, which will be joined to the merits phase (if jurisdiction is upheld and if the Respondent elects to pursue this argument at that stage).\n\n**D. The Third Objection**\n--------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants acquired their alleged investments in respect of claims arising out of events that pre-date those investments, such that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over such claims,29 or, alternatively, it may not exercise its jurisdiction because an acquisition of an investment when a dispute is foreseeable is an abuse of process.30\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.56.\n\nR's Request, \u00a7\u00a73.59-3.60.\n\n36.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants say this:\n\n[T]he Claimants first invested in Kuwait when Ayat Sumrain acquired a first tranche of shares in HVREC on 15 April 2013. The Claimants acquired further shares in HVREC between 2013-2017. The dispute, which relates to Kuwait\u2019s treatment of these investments, particularly following the Addendum (concluded in December 2014), therefore falls within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione temporis*.31\n\nCs' Memorial, \u00a7192.\n\n37.\n\nFrom this brief summary, the Tribunal considers that there is at least a serious issue to be determined concerning the timing of each Claimant\u2019s investment and the timing of the elements of each claim for a breach of the BIT that are pleaded by the Claimants, as well as the timing of the dispute. The above-quoted paragraph suggests that the dispute arose at some point following the Addendum (signed in December 2014) and that some of the Claimants acquired their investments between 2013 and 2017. There may be overlap between these two critical dates. Moreover, the Claimants\u2019 Memorial also suggests that it is possible that some of the elements of the claims arose before some of the Claimants acquired their investments, as such elements are pleaded as \"*starting in 2015*\".32\n\nCs' Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7216-217.\n\n38.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal finds that it is unlikely, based upon the materials before it, that the Third Objection would dispose of the entire dispute even if it were upheld on the terms pleaded by the Respondent given that, on the Claimants\u2019 pleaded case, the First Claimant acquired her investment well before the other Claimants and thus might be said to be in a different position in this respect. The Respondent contends that its Third Objection would also dispose of the First Claimant\u2019s claims, as it maintains that the dispute arose earlier than in 2014, but nonetheless opines that its objection is \"stronger\" in relation to the Second to Fourth Claimants.33 The Tribunal would not have bifurcated this Third Objection in isolation but, given its decision in relation to the Second Objection, it considers that it would be expedient to determine the Third Objection as a preliminary issue alongside the Second Objection. The Second Objection focuses on the nature and scope of the alleged investments, whereas the Third Objection focuses on their timing. Once again, it would be useful to have clarity on these issues even if the objections were to be rejected because this may limit the scope of issues to be decided in a liability/quantum phase.\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.65.\n\n39.\n\nThe Third Objection will require the Tribunal to consider carefully the formulation of the claims as presented by the Claimants in their Memorial to ascertain the points in time at at which the claims arose from a legal perspective, but that does not involve trespassing onto the merits of those claims at a preliminary stage. Likewise, the Tribunal may need to decide when the dispute actually arose in accordance with the objective legal criteria, but that does not entail venturing into the merits either.\n\n40.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal considers that it would be expedient to determine the Third Objection in a preliminary phase in conjunction with the Second Objection.\n\n**E. The Fourth Objection**\n---------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Fourth Objection is that *\"claims for contractual breaches are inadmissible\"*. It argues that:\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 claims are plainly claims for breaches of contract.\n\nWhile the Claimants attempt to shoehorn their contractual claims into treaty claims by alleging breach of legitimate expectations, breach of an umbrella clause and even expropriation, they fail to point to any conduct by the Respondent that affected their shareholding.34\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.77.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent continues:\n\n[T]he investment the Claimants are seeking to protect are the *shares* they hold in HVREC, either directly or indirectly through Thimar. Their attempt at claiming that they hold a separate investment in the Contract or the Project is untenable.35\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.78 (emphasis in original).\n\n43.\n\nThis submission needs to be addressed in segments. First, the question of whether the Claimants \"*hold a separate investment in the Contract or the Project*\" appears to depend, on the Respondent\u2019s case, on the resolution of the issue embedded in the Second Objection concerning whether the Claimants have a \"*majority interest*\" in HVREC (directly or indirectly) for the purposes of Article 1 of the BIT. This points to the expediency of deciding the Second Objection before addressing the Fourth Objection.\n\n44.\n\nSecond, the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Claimants\u2019 claims as \"*claims for breaches of contract*\" will, as the Claimants argue, entail a detailed investigation into the merits of the claims.36 The Tribunal will have to consider, among other things, whether the Respondent's conduct remained within the four corners of the contractual relationship with HVREC or whether the Respondent exercised sovereign powers outside the contractual framework in a manner that undermined HVREC's contractual rights. This also points to the expediency of joining this objection to the merits.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a751.\n\n45.\n\nThird, the Respondent characterizes the Fourth Objection as relating to the admissibility of claims. For the reasons previously discussed, the particular sensitivities in exercising jurisdiction in circumstances where the jurisdictional mandate is challenged do not arise here.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal thus declines to order the bifurcation of the Fourth Objection.\n\n**F. The Fifth Objection**\n--------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to comply with the requirements for the submission of this dispute to arbitration under Article 10 of the BIT, which reads in relevant part:\n\n1. Disputes which arise between a Contracting State and an investor of the other Contracting State, in relation to an investment of the latter in the territory of the first State, shall be settled, as far as possible, by amicable means.\n\n2. If such dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date on which either of the two parties to the dispute requested an amicable settlement by notifying the other party in writing, then the dispute shall be referred for resolution by one of the following means, to be chosen by the investor who is a party to the dispute...37\n\nCL-0012, Kuwait-Egypt BIT.\n\n48.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to deliver a written notice to the Respondent requesting the amicable settlement of the dispute and did not allow the six-month period to elapse before filing the Request for Arbitration.38 The Respondent maintains that these failures deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.39 The Claimants counter with evidence that they did satisfy the requirements of Article 10 of the BIT and they maintain that they are properly characterized as \"*procedural and directory in nature, rather than jurisdictional and mandatory*\".40\n\nR's Request, \u00a73.89.\n\nR's Request, \u00a7\u00a73.91-3.92.\n\nCs' Reply, \u00a760.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants rely upon several letters relating to the dispute that were sent to the Respondent starting with a letter to the Prime Minister on 28 November 2018. That letter concludes with the following paragraph:\n\nTherefore, due to the damages incurred by the investment, the Investors are forced to resort to the international arbitration authorities before the investors\u2019 disputes settlement committee under the auspices of the World Bank in order to present their case and to seek compensation for the damage incurred due to the governmental authorities\u2019 arbitrary actions as to the ongoing obstacles to date. This is in case the existing and regularly emerging obstacles and problems facing the Project are not removed, so that we are able to implement the Project.41\n\nC-0238, Letter from HVREC to Kuwaiti Prime Minister dated 28 November 2018, p. 5.\n\n50.\n\nThe further letters are dated 28 November 2018, 15 January 2019 and 12 May 2019.42 The final letter was sent within six months of the Request for Arbitration. There was no response from the Respondent to these letters save that the First Claimant has testified that she received a phone call from the Respondent proposing an amicable settlement on 4 July 2019 after the Request for Arbitration was filed.43\n\nC-0237, Letter from HVREC to Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance dated 28 November 2018; C-0246, Letter from HVREC to Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance dated 15 January 2019; C-0253, Letter from HVREC to Kuwaiti Prime Minister dated 12 May 2019.\n\nWitness Statement of Ayat Sumrain, \u00a7143.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent takes certain points in relation to these letters: the Respondent says that they were printed on HVREC\u2019s letter head; not all the Claimants signed every letter; and the letters do not, in express terms, request an \"*amicable settlement of the dispute*\".44\n\nR's Request \u00a73.90.\n\n52.\n\nAs the Tribunal has elected to birfurcate the Second and Third Objection, it considers that the issues raised by the Fifth Objection are so narrow and self-contained that it would be expedient to rule upon the Fifth Objection in the preliminary phase in conjunction with the Second and Third Objections.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S RULING**\n-----------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal orders the bifurcation of the Second, Third and Fifth Objections raised by the Respondent. Given this ruling, the Claimants are invited to consider whether they would wish to include, at their discretion, any of the other objections raised by the Respondent in the preliminary phase (the Tribunal proceeds on the assumption that the Respondent, having requested that all its objections be heard in the preliminary phase has already consented to the same). The Claimants are requested to state their position on this issue on or before **5 February 2021**.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that it has additional availability on 20 May 2021 should the Parties consider that a three-day hearing is required. The Parties are invited to state their position on this issue on or before **12 February 2021**."}]}
