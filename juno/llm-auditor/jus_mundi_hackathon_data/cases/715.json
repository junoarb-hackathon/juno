PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy letter of 24 December 2002, Plama Consortium Limited (\"Plama\" or \"the Claimant\"), a Cypriot company, filed a request for arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") against the Republic of Bulgaria (\"Bulgaria\" or \"the Respondent\"). The request invoked the ICSID arbitration provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") and the most favored nation (\"MFN\") provision of a bilateral investment treaty (\"BIT\") entered into in 1987 between the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the Agreement on Mutual Encouragement and Protection of Investments (\"the BIT\"), which would import into the BIT the ICSID arbitration provisions of other BITs entered into by Bulgaria.\n\n2.\n\nThe Centre, on 14 January 2003, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Institution Rules\") acknowledged receipt of the request and on the same day transmitted a copy to the Republic of Bulgaria and to the Bulgarian Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nThere ensued exchanges of correspondence between the parties and the Acting Secretary General of ICSID concerning the jurisdiction of ICSID over the Request made by the Claimant and its registerability under Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\") and ICSID Institution Rules 6 and 7.\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the Claimant filed a Supplement to Request for Arbitration dated 6 April 2003. The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Supplement to Request for Arbitration, on 17 April 2003, and on the same day transmitted a copy to the Republic of Bulgaria and to the Bulgarian Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n5.\n\nOn 12 June 2003, Professor Emmanuel Gaillard and Mr. John Savage of the law firm, Sherman & Sterling LLP, informed the Centre that they had been retained as new counsel for the Claimant, replacing Mr. Christian Nordtomme.\n\n6.\n\nUpon requests from both parties, the Centre deferred registration. A further postponement of registration was finally sought by the Respondent on 12 August 2003, but was opposed by the Claimant.\n\n7.\n\nThe request as supplemented was registered by the Centre on 19 August 2003, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, and on the same day the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 August 2003, the Respondent informed the Centre that it had retained as counsel in the proceeding Mr. Paul D. Friedland, Mmes. Carolyn B. Lamm and Abby Cohen Smutny of the law firm, White & Case LLP. By a letter of 25 March 2004, the Respondent further indicated having retained Mr. Lazar Tomov of the law firm, Tomov & Tomov.\n\n9.\n\nFollowing the registration of the request for arbitration by the Centre, the parties agreed on a three-member Tribunal. The parties agreed that each would appoint an arbitrator and that the third arbitrator, who would be the president of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the parties. The parties agreed that if they failed to agree on the presiding arbitrator, the Centre would appoint the President of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimant appointed Mr. Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, IT Tower - 9th Floor, 480, Avenue Louise, Bte 9, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium, and the Respondent appointed Mr. V. V. Veeder, a national of the United Kingdom, Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, England.\n\n11.\n\nIn the absence of agreement by the parties regarding the appointment of a President, the Centre, after consultation with the parties as far as possible, appointed directly as President of the Tribunal, Mr. Carl F. Salans, a national of the United-States, 9 rue Boissy d'Anglas, 75008 Paris, France.\n\n12.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre by a letter of 10 February 2004, informed the parties of the constitution of the Tribunal, and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID's Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"the ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). The parties were further informed that Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Written and Oral Procedure**\n---------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), after consulting with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal scheduled a first session, in Paris for 25 March 2004. The parties, by a joint letter of 19 March 2004, communicated to the Tribunal the agreements they had reached on procedural matters identified in the provisional agenda for the first session, which had been sent to them by the Tribunal's Secretary. In that letter, the parties notified the Tribunal that the Respondent intended to raise objections to jurisdiction, which the Tribunal would be required to rule on before proceeding to the merits of the case in accordance with Article 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The parties in the same letter informed the Tribunal that they had not reached an agreement on the procedural schedule.\n\n14.\n\nAt the first session of the Tribunal held in Paris on 25 March 2004, the parties reiterated their agreement on the points communicated to the Tribunal in their joint letter of 19 March 2004, and the remainder of the procedural issues on the agenda for the session were discussed and agreed. All the conclusions were reflected in the written minutes of the session, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and provided to the parties, as well as all Members of the Tribunal. It was agreed that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction would be treated as a preliminary question. A schedule for the filing of memorials and for the holding of a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris on 20 and 21 September 2004, was agreed.\n\n15.\n\nPursuant to the agreed schedule, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction on 26 May 2004. The Claimant submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 25 June 2004. This was followed, on 26 July 2004, by a Reply on Jurisdiction from the Respondent. The Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 26 August 2004, was received by the Centre on 30 August 2004.\n\n16.\n\nOn 26 July 2004, the Respondent submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal a request for the production of documents by the Claimant. By letter dated 6 August 2004, the Claimant opposed that request. After considering the views of the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal, on 11 August 2004, issued an Order directing the Claimant to produce all documents falling within the categories listed in the Order, no later than with the filing of its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. The Claimant filed certain documents with its 26 August 2004 Rejoinder. Further to a request for extension made on 17 August 2004, which was accepted by the Respondent, the Claimant submitted to the Respondent, under cover of a letter dated 6 September 2004, documents pursuant to the Tribunal's Order. The Claimant made an additional production of documents by letter dated 13 September 2004.\n\n17.\n\nA hearing on the preliminary questions was held in Paris on 20 and 21 September 2004, during which Messrs. Emmanuel Gaillard and John Savage addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant and Mr. Paul D. Friedland, Ms. Carolyn B. Lamm, Ms. Abby Cohen Smutny and Mr. Jonathan Hamilton addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent. One witness, Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin, testified for the Claimant.\n\n18.\n\nFollowing the September 2004 hearing, the parties filed submissions relating to the documents produced pursuant to the Tribunal's Order of 11 August 2004 as well as to costs.\n\n**II. Background Facts**\n------------------------\n\n19.\n\nAccording to the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant -- then known as Trammel Investment Limited -- purchased from EuroEnergy Holding OOD (hereafter, \"EEH\") all of EEH's 49,837,849 shares of Plama AD, which later changed its name to Nova Plama AD (\"Nova Plama\"), a Bulgarian company which owned an oil refinery in Bulgaria, representing 96.78% of Nova Plama's capital. The share purchase agreement was concluded on 18 September 1998. The transfer of shares took place on 18 December 1998.\n\n20.\n\nThe refinery's key industrial asset was a lubricants manufacturing unit which processes base-oils produced by the refinery into a wide range of industrial and consumer lubricants which were used as raw materials for lubricants at the refinery or by third party blenders. Nova Plama also has its own power plant with a capacity for sales of excess electric power to the local grid.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Bulgarian government, the national legislative and judicial authorities and other public authorities and agencies deliberately created numerous grave problems for Nova Plama and/or refused or unreasonably delayed the adoption of adequate corrective measures. These actions and omissions, according to the Claimant, caused and are still causing material damage to the operations of the refinery and have had, and are still having, a direct negative impact on the reputations and market values of the respective Plama group companies. Bulgaria's actions and/or omissions violate the ECT, to which both Bulgaria and Cyprus are parties,1 and the BIT. The Claimant seeks an award of damages for breaches of the treaties and compensation for expropriation.\n\nBulgaria ratified the ECT on 15 November 1996 and Cyprus, on 16 January 1998.\n\n22.\n\nThe Energy Charter Treaty is a multilateral convention whose purpose, according to Article 2 of the Treaty, is to establish a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy sector. In Part III of the Treaty, Contracting States undertake the obligation to accord to the Investments of Investors (as those terms are defined in the Treaty) of other Contracting States \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"the most constant protection and security\". By Article 17 of the Treaty, which is found in Part III, Contracting States reserve the right to deny the advantages of Part III to a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control that entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized. Article 26, Part V, of the Treaty is devoted to dispute resolution and provides, *inter alia*, the right of Investors to resort to arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent, in the first instance, argues that the claims made by the Claimant fall outside the jurisdiction of ICSID.\n\n24.\n\nBulgaria ratified the ICSID Convention on 13 May 2001. Cyprus did so on 25 November 1996.\n\n25.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n26.\n\nBecause they are referred to repeatedly in the parties' submissions and in this Decision, the texts of certain provisions of the ECT and the BIT as well as of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties are set forth at this point.\n\n***ECT***\n\n*Article 17 - Non-Application of Part III2 in Certain Circumstances.*\n\n*Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:*\n\n*(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized;...*\n\n*(2) an Investment, if the denying Contracting Party establishes that such Investment is an Investment of an Investor of a third state with as to which the denying Contracting Party:*\n\n*(a) does not maintain a diplomatic relationship; or*\n\n*(b) adopts or maintains measures that:*\n\n*(i) prohibit transactions with Investors of that state; or*\n\n*(ii) would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Part were accorded to Investors of that state or to their Investments.*\n\n*Article 26 - Settlement of Disputes Between An Investor and a Contracting Party.*\n\n*(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another* *Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the* *former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.*\n\n*(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.*\n\n*(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:*\n\n*(a)(i) The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\"), if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the* *Contracting Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*...*\n\n*(b) a sole arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (hereinafter referred to as \"UNCITRAL\"); or*\n\n*(c) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n*...*\n\n*(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.*\n\n***THE BIT***\n\n*Article 3*\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall apply to the investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment which is not less favorable than that accorded to investments by investors of third states.*\n\n*...*\n\n*Article 4*\n\n*4.1 The legality of the expropriation shall be checked at the request of the concerned investor through the regular administrative and legal procedure of the contracting party that had taken the expropriation steps. In cases of dispute with regard to the amount of the compensation, which disputes were not settled in an administrative order, the concerned investor and the legal representatives of the other Contracting Party shall hold consultations for fixing this value. If within 3 months after the beginning of the consultations no agreement is reached, the amount of the compensation at the request of the* *concerned investor shall be checked either in a legal regular procedure of the Contracting Party which had taken the measure on expropriation or by an international \"Ad hoc\" Arbitration Court.*\n\n*4.2 The International Court of Arbitration mentioned in paragraph 4.1 of the Article 4 shall be established on a case-by-case basis. Each Contracting Party shall designate one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators agree upon a national of the third state to be a Chairman. If the appointments are not made within the time period specified above, and if no other arrangement is agreed, either Contracting Party may request the Chairman of the Court of Arbitration to the Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm to make the necessary appointments.*\n\n*4.3 The arbitration procedure is determined by the Arbitration Court itself, by applying the arbitration regulations of the U.N. Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) of 15th December 1976.*\n\n***THE VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES***\n\n*Article 31 General rule of interpretation*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.*\n\n*Article 32 Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n*Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.*\n\nPart III of the ECT provides for the treatment to be accorded by the Contracting Parties to investments covered by the Treaty in their territory.\n\n**III. The Submissions of the Parties on Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant argues in the Request for Arbitration that the Respondent has consented to ICSID arbitration of disputes regarding investments such as that made by PCL in Nova Plama by virtue of its ratification of the ECT as well as by virtue of the Most Favored Nation (\"MFN\") clause of the BIT.\n\n**A. The Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 May 2004, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction whose principal arguments are summarized in paragraphs 29 to 39 hereafter.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction must be established by reference to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which requires the consent in writing of the parties to the dispute to submit to ICSID disputes arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent contends that its consent to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration under Article 26 (1) ECT is expressly limited to disputes concerning an alleged breach of an obligation arising under Part III of the ECT. Part III contains Article 17, which reserves to a Contracting Party the right to deny the advantages of that Part to \" *a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized* \".\n\n31.\n\nPromptly upon receiving the Claimant's Request for Arbitration on 24 December 2002, the Respondent, in a letter to ICSID dated 18 February 2003, exercised its right in accordance with Article 17(1) ECT to deny the advantages of the ECT to the Claimant, citing the lack of evidence as to ownership and control. It did so on the basis that the Claimant is a \"mailbox company\" which has no substantial business activities in the Republic of Cyprus, where it is incorporated; and it has failed to establish that it is owned or controlled by nationals of an ECT Contracting State.\n\n32.\n\nSince, the Respondent says, it has denied and continues to deny to the Claimant the protections afforded by Article 17(1) ECT, Bulgaria's consent to submit disputes as to alleged breaches of ECT obligations does not provide a basis for jurisdiction in this case.\n\n33.\n\nIt is the contention of the Respondent that when, on the basis of Article 17(1), a Contracting Party rightfully denies the advantages of Part III to a legal entity, the ECT does not apply to the circumstances of that entity. Consequently, there can be no corresponding breach of any ECT Part III obligation. The entity's posture vis-\u00e0-vis the ECT is akin to a legal entity from a non-ECT State, which could not avail itself of Part III of the treaty.\n\n34.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence which it has been able to find, and which has been produced to it by the Claimant, the Respondent concludes that it is at best unclear whether an ECT national owned or was in control of the Claimant over the period of time relevant to its claims, as from its incorporation until after Bulgaria raised its Article 17(1) objection. The Respondent asserts that a Mr. Timothy O'Neill, a Canadian national, and a Bahamian company, Dolsamex International S.A. (\"Dolsame\"x), hold the bearer shares of PCL, that 1000 shares of the Claimant have been owned indirectly by unknown non-residents of Cyprus from 2 September 1998, to the present, that from 1 March 2001 until today a further 4000 shares in the Claimant have been held by another non-ECT mailbox company and that as from incorporation until after Bulgaria raised its objection under Article 17(1) ECT the directors of the Claimant were either mere nominees or non-ECT nationals, making it uncertain whether an ECT national was in control during the time period relevant to its claims.\n\n35.\n\nTurning to the BIT between Cyprus and Bulgaria, it is the Respondent's contention that it did not consent by virtue of the MFN clause of that treaty to submit claims presented by the Claimant to ICSID arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nCiting Article 4 of the International Law Commission's Final Draft Articles on Most Favored Nation Clauses, the Respondent says that an MFN obligation applies only \"in an agreed sphere of relations\" (the *ejusdem generis* rule). The rule provides that MFN treatment can be claimed only within the framework set by the clause and relates only to the subject matter for which the clause has been stipulated. Bulgaria's treaty practice and the context of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT demonstrate that Bulgaria did not consider the terms of its consent to international arbitration to be encompassed in its agreements to extend MFN treatment. Consequently, the 1987 Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT provides investors only limited access to international arbitration subject to restrictive terms. BITs concluded by Bulgaria following the collapse of communism reflect fundamental changes in Bulgaria's public policy and in the applicable legal regime which do not inform the object and purpose or context of its earlier BITs, such as that with Cyprus.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the MFN provision of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT cannot be interpreted as providing consent to submit a dispute under that treaty to ICSID arbitration. It summarizes its three basic arguments. First, that absent express evidence otherwise, an MFN provision cannot create a basis for jurisdiction where none exists in the basic treaty. Second, that the subject matter of the MFN provision in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT does not encompass dispute resolution. Third, that even if dispute resolution is deemed to fall within the subject matter of the treatment contemplated by the BIT, the Claimant cannot invoke MFN treatment to override fundamental policy considerations reflected in the BIT's provisions.\n\n38.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that ICSID's Secretary General did not register the Claimant's request for ICSID arbitration of its dispute as to the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT but only as to the ECT, compelling the conclusion that the dispute is outside ICSID's jurisdiction with respect to the BIT.\n\n39.\n\nFor all the reasons set forth in its memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent asks that the Claimant's claims be dismissed in their entirety. The Respondent also requests the Tribunal to order the Claimant to compensate it for all the costs and expenses of this proceeding.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 25 June 2004. It claims that Bulgaria has consented in Article 26 ECT to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration or, in the alternative, through operation of the MFN clause in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT. The Claimant's principal arguments are summarized in paragraphs 41 - 53 below.\n\n41.\n\nWith respect to the ECT, the Claimant's position is that the Respondent's reliance on Article 17(1) to deny the Claimant the advantages of Part III of the ECT is not a true objection to jurisdiction but rather is a defense on the merits - a denial by the Respondent of the benefits of Part III, which would not affect Bulgaria's offer of (or consent to) arbitration, which is found in Part V of the ECT. The Claimant argues that from the moment it alleges a breach by Bulgaria of its obligations under Part III of the ECT, those allegations become an acceptance of Bulgaria's offer of arbitration under Article 26(3) ECT.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant goes on to say that even though Bulgaria's objection based on Article 17(1) is not an issue of jurisdiction, the Claimant is prepared to have the Arbitral Tribunal decide on that objection as part of the preliminary phase of the arbitration.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant argues that any valid denial of Part III benefits by Bulgaria would only affect benefits otherwise applicable after the date of denial. Article 17(1) ECT constitutes a reservation by each Contracting Party of a right to deny the advantages of Part III but does not constitute a denial of the benefits in itself. That right, to become effective, must be expressly exercised, and once exercised, cannot take effect retroactively. The Claimant contends that the Respondent's purported exercise of the denial of Part III benefits to the Claimant only occurred on 18 February 2003, when its Ministry of Finance sent a letter to ICSID stating that the application of the ECT to the Claimant \"shall be denied\".\n\n44.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant says, Article 17(1) ECT cannot apply in this case because the conditions for its application do not exist. These conditions are that the investor company must be owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a state not party to the ECT and that the investor must have no substantial business activities in the area of the Contracting State in which it is organized. According to the Claimant, the burden is on Bulgaria, the party relying on Article 17(1), to show that the two conditions of application are satisfied.\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it has been owned and controlled from the date of investment to the present time by Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin, a national of France, which is a contracting party to the ECT. This ownership and control is described by the Claimant as set forth in paragraphs 46 - 49 below.\n\n46.\n\nPCL was incorporated in Cyprus on 2 September 1998 under the name Trammel Investments, Ltd. It changed its name to Plama Consortium Limited on 24 September 1998. PCL has an authorized share capital of 5000 shares. On 2 September 1998, 500 shares were issued to Mediterranean Link (Nominees) Ltd. (\"MedLink Nominees\") and 500 shares to Mediterranean Link (Trustees) Ltd. (\"Medlink Trustees\"), both purportedly acting as nominees of a Cyprus non-resident beneficiary, Plama Holding Limited (\"PHL\").\n\n47.\n\nPHL has an authorized capital of 5000 shares. On 13 September 1998, it issued 500 shares to MedLink Nominees and 100 shares to MedLink Trustees, both purportedly acting as nominees of a Cyprus non-resident beneficiary, EMU Investments Limited (\"EMU\"). A further 400 shares of PHL were issued to MedLink Trustees as nominee of a Cyprus non-resident beneficiary, Norwegian Oil Trading (\"NOT\"). On 26 October 1998, 400 shares of PHL were transferred from MedLink Trustees as nominee of NOT to MedLink Trustees as nominee of EMU. From that date, EMU has been the sole beneficial owner of PHL.\n\n48.\n\nOn 1 March 2001, PCL issued its remaining 4000 shares to EMU. From 1 March 2001, EMU has been the immediate majority shareholder of PCL, with PHL retaining, through MedLink Nominees and MedLink Trustees, 1000 shares or twenty percent of PCL's shares.\n\n49.\n\nEMU was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 21 August 1997. On that date, the Board of Directors issued 60 bearer shares. In the autumn of 1998, when EMU became the sole shareholder of PHL, Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin was the owner of EMU's entire issued share capital, which means that through EMU's ownership of the shares of PHL and PCL, Mr. Vautrin was and is the sole beneficial owner of PCL. The 60 bearer share certificates of EMU were initially in the possession of Mr. Vautrin. From June or July 1999 to February 2004, these shares were held for the exclusive benefit of Mr. Vautrin by Mr. Per Christian Nordtomme, a Norwegian lawyer. Since February 2004, he has held 30 of these bearer shares for the benefit of Mr. Vautrin; and Mr. Tom Eivind Haug, another Norwegian lawyer, has held 30 bearer shares of EMU for Mr. Vautrin's benefit since 12 February 2004.\n\n50.\n\nAs for the Dolsamex/O'Neill claim to ownership of PCL's shares, the Claimant argues that they were mere \"chargees\" with a lien on those shares, which could not give rise to a legal or beneficial right of ownership over the shares. While they were able to obtain possession of PCL's share certificates through court actions in Switzerland, there has been no transfer of either legal or beneficial ownership of the shares to Mr. O'Neill, Dolsamex or Mr. O'Neill's Bulgarian associates. Moreover, any rights as chargees or otherwise they may have would attach to only 1000, or twenty percent of PCL's shares owned by PHL which were held in escrow to secure royalty payments under certain agreements made by the parties, since, on 1 March 2001, PCL had issued 4000 shares directly to EMU.\n\n51.\n\nWith respect to the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, it is the position of the Claimant that Bulgaria consented to ICSID arbitration of this dispute by virtue of the MFN clause of that treaty. The Claimant argues that the MFN clause must be construed as extending to more favorable dispute settlement mechanisms than those in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT which are contained in other investment treaties concluded by Bulgaria. Bulgaria's objections on the basis of policy and otherwise are irrelevant and misguided.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, the Claimant says that the registration by ICSID of its Request for Arbitration can have no effect on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. Rule 6 of the Institution Rules does not allow for the partial registration of a request, and, therefore, the Claimant's Request must be deemed to have been registered in its entirety.\n\n53.\n\nIn its request for relief, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to make a decision:\n\n(i) dismissing Bulgaria's objections to jurisdiction, and retaining jurisdiction over the claims raised by PCL in this arbitration;\n\n(ii) in the event that it finds the conditions of application of Article 17(1) ECT to be fulfilled in this case, declaring that Bulgaria's exercise of its right under Article 17(1) ECT shall only operate to deny PCL the advantages of Part III of the ECT after the date of such exercise, and that (a) PCL therefore benefited from the advantages of Part III of the ECT prior to such date, and (b) the pursuit by PCL of claims in respect of breaches by Bulgaria of the obligations (or advantages) owed to PCL under Part III of the ECT prior to such date is therefore unaffected by Bulgaria's exercise of its right to deny PCL Part III advantages;\n\n(iii) ordering Bulgaria to pay the full costs incurred by PCL in resisting Bulgaria's objections to jurisdiction, including the fees and expenses of the Centre, the arbitrators and PCL's legal counsel.\n\n(iv) granting PCL any other relief that the Tribunal shall deem appropriate; and\n\n(v) proceeding to hear the merits of PCL's claims.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 26 July 2004, the Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdiction. Its principal arguments are summarized below in paragraphs 55-68 below.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent states first that in the terms of Article 17(1) ECT, PCL has never had any substantial business activity in Cyprus. As for the tests of ownership or control in Article 17(1), the Respondent states that it has assembled evidence that:\n\n(i) a consortium of foreign investors, including a Swiss company, Andr\u00e9 & Cie (\"Andr\u00e9\"), and the Norwegian company, NOT, (Switzerland and Norway not being parties to the ECT), was responsible for the purchase of Nova Plama in late 1998;\n\n(ii) to the extent that Mr. Vautrin was involved in the solicitation and supervision of the investment in Nova Plama in his 1998-2001 contacts with the Respondent, he was at all times presented and identified as acting, not on his own behalf, but as a representative of Andr\u00e9;\n\n(iii) The Claimant has been directly owned and controlled by entities and individuals from non-ECT States, including the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and Norway.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant is asking the Tribunal to ignore the *documented* role of all these entities in favor of the *undocumented* role of one French national whose name does not appear on any publicly available corporate records of ownership (in terms of shareholding) or control (in terms of directors) of PCL until June 2003, well after Bulgaria first raised its Article 17(1) ECT objection.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Claimant also is asking the Tribunal to ignore the fact that, when the Claimant made its original investment, it concluded contracts with third parties (O'Neill/Dolsamex) granting security interests over the shares in PCL; that events leading those third parties to seek to exercise their security interests occurred; that the Claimant took steps to frustrate those parties from exercising their rights; and that litigation is now proceeding in several courts regarding the legal consequences of these events.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent argues that consistent with ECT Understanding N\u00b0 3, the Claimant bears the burden of proof under Article 17 ECT. Even if the Respondent initially had the burden of proving the justification for the denial of Article 17(1) ECT benefits, given the above evidence, the burden of proof has shifted to the party which is in exclusive control of the relevant evidence, i.e., the Claimant.\n\n59.\n\nIn addition, the fact that issues central to the ownership and control of PCL are subject to litigation in Switzerland (and possibly other jurisdictions as well), in regard to a dispute that pre-dates this arbitration, makes a determination by this Tribunal as to ownership unworkable because this Tribunal's decisions cannot bind all the parties to the wider dispute about ownership and control of the Claimant.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to produce credible evidence demonstrating that Mr. Vautrin has ever been its ultimate owner. Nor has it produced such evidence regarding Mr. Vautrin's control over the non-ECT entities which have exercised control over the Claimant. The fact that the Claimant has refused to produce relevant evidence uniquely in its control is a sufficient basis to conclude that Mr. Vautrin's unsworn, unsupported assertions regarding ownership and control cannot be sustained.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to allege that there is substantial evidence that Andr\u00e9 and NOT and other entities have owned or controlled the Claimant and that the consent of the Republic of Bulgaria to sell Nova Plama was predicated on the fact that these two companies were the purchasers, i.e., that PCL was a consortium of Andr\u00e9 and NOT. During the negotiation of that sale, Mr. Vautrin represented himself to the Bulgarian authorities not as an investor on his own behalf but as a representative of Andr\u00e9. Should material misrepresentation be found, the investment must be deemed to have been solicited and pursued in violation of Bulgarian law, with the consequence that the protections of the ECT and the BIT would not apply.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent repeats the argument contained in its Memorial on Jurisdiction that the rights of ownership and control of the Claimant are held by Mr. Timothy O'Neill and Dolsamex International, S.A. The rights of Dolsamex are effectively those of an owner, not a mere \"chargee\". The issuance in March 2001 of 4000 shares in PCL to EMU was an attempt by the Claimant to dilute PHL's shareholding in PCL and was wrongful. In light of the contracts involving those parties and related disputes pending in Swiss courts, the Respondent says the Claimant cannot prove and the Tribunal cannot find that there is an adequate degree of certainty regarding Mr. Vautrin's asserted ownership and control of the Claimant and, accordingly, should sustain the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction. As an alternative, in light of the fact that Mr. Vautrin's ownership and control of the Claimant are *sub judice* in Switzerland, the Tribunal should stay the arbitration until the litigation has been definitively resolved. Otherwise, the Respondent will be exposed to the risk that multiple claims may be commenced by competing owners claiming to be acting for the Claimant and that, should an award be issued in the Claimant's favor, the Respondent will pay an award to an entity with no legal entitlement to act for the company.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Mr. O'Neill and Dolsamex have had contractual rights under a Throughput Agreement and Deed of Charge to control the Claimant since the Claimant's alleged initial investment and that Mr. Vautrin's claim to ownership and control of the Claimant cannot be quieted while disputes with Mr. O'Neill and Dolsamex remain unresolved.\n\n64.\n\nIn answer to the Claimant's argument that Article 17(1) ECT constitutes a reservation which permits a Contracting State to exercise the right to deny benefits to certain investors, which denial, to be effective, must be exercised, the Respondent says that Article 17 is not a reservation. Rather Article 17 contains substantive provisions of the treaty which qualify, limit or narrow the scope of the Contracting Parties' Part III obligations. Where the conditions in Article 17(1) are met, ECT Contracting Parties have no Part III obligations. A Contracting Party need not take any further step to realize its right to deny.\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has only consented in Article 26 ECT to submit a defined class of disputes to ICSID arbitration, i.e., one concerning an alleged breach of an obligation under Part III. The Claimant cannot allege a breach of an obligation of Bulgaria under Part III because Bulgaria owes no Part III obligations to the Claimant.\n\n66.\n\nWith respect to the MFN clause in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, Bulgaria demonstrated in its Memorial that the MFN clause in the BIT cannot support jurisdiction in this case. That is because (a) the MFN provision in this case does not encompass dispute resolution and (b) the MFN provision cannot transform the consent given by Bulgaria under other treaties to submit other disputes to ICSID arbitration into consent to submit disputes under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT to ICSID arbitration. The terms of the MFN provision, interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context, and in light of the BIT's object and purpose, show the Respondent did not consent to the ICSID arbitration of the disputes in issue in the present case.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates its argument that the registration of this case by ICSID shows that the Request for Arbitration was registered only with respect to the ECT, not the BIT.\n\n68.\n\nFinally, the Respondent sets forth its request for relief in identical terms to those in its Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n**D. The Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 26 August 2004. The principal arguments made in the Rejoinder are summarized below in paragraphs 70 - 80 below.\n\n70.\n\nWith respect to Article 17(1) ECT, the Claimant says that ECT Part III does not include the Treaty's investor/state dispute resolution provisions which are found in Part V, Article 26, and, therefore, does not affect either the parties' consent to ICSID jurisdiction or ICSID's jurisdiction more generally. The Respondent's objection, consequently, is not an objection to jurisdiction but a defense to the merits of the Claimant's claims.\n\n71.\n\nIn any event, argues the Claimant, Article 17 ECT can only operate to allow the Respondent to deny advantages or benefits otherwise available after the date of the exercise of the right to deny those benefits; and Article 17 does not apply at all because the Claimant is owned and controlled by an ECT national and has been since it invested in Bulgaria in 1998.\n\n72.\n\nIt cannot be, according to the Claimant, that Article 17 ECT operates automatically to deny benefits under Part III to investors falling within its ambit because, if that were the case, Article 17 would be no more than an \"exception\" or exclusion clause which, unlike Article 24 ECT, it is not.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant argues that to interpret Article 17(1) ECT as requiring a Contracting State to exercise its option to deny rights to certain investors would not be burdensome to the Contracting State. If it is deemed important enough that various categories of investors within the scope of Article 17 be denied the benefits of the ECT, it is open to such State to declare this upon its accession to the ECT and thereby exercise its right to deny such benefits from the outset.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that it does not conduct substantial business activities in Cyprus. However, as to the ownership of PCL, the Claimant states that the British Virgin Islands company, EMU, which owns PHL and PCL, issued bearer shares, that Mr. Vautrin is able to produce the bearer shares in question, and that it is in the nature of such shares that their presentation is sufficient *prima facie* proof of ownership at the present time. With regard to ownership and possession of the shares in the past, the Claimant relies on personal testimony of himself, nominees, agents and others that Mr. Vautrin was in actual physical or constructive possession of the shares at all material times. Unless the Respondent is able to produce evidence casting doubt on Mr. Vautrin's possession of those shares at the relevant times, no further proof of previous ownership is necessary to discharge the Claimant's *prime facie* burden of proof.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant admits that at the time of its purchase of Nova Plama certain of Bulgaria's representatives were unaware that Mr. Vautrin was the ultimate owner of the Claimant. But Mr. Vautrin, the Claimant or others made no misrepresentations as to the Claimant's ownership. The Respondent appeared largely indifferent as to the identity of the Claimant's ultimate owner.\n\n76.\n\nRegarding the claims by Dolsamex and Mr. O'Neill to ownership or control of PCL, the Claimant denies (a) that they have had a contractual right to control the Claimant since the date of the Claimant's incorporation; (b) that the Throughput Agreement and Deed of Charge granted Dolsamex absolute ownership and control rights over the Claimant and not those of a mere \"chargee\"; (c) that Mr. O'Neill's physical possession of PCL share certificates is *prima facie* evidence of Dolsamex's right to control the Claimant and that the Claimant has frustrated Mr. O'Neill's security rights and Dolsamex's attempt to sell the shares in the Claimant by not providing Dolsamex with the original instruments of transfer; (d) that the issuance of the remaining 4000 shares in the Claimant to EMU was an attempt to dilute PHL's shareholding in the Claimant and was not performed in accordance with Cypriot law; and (e) that to acknowledge Mr. Vautrin's ownership of and control over the Claimant in the face of legal proceedings in Switzerland would expose Bulgaria to the risk of multiple claims by owners claiming to act for the Claimant.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant states that the names on its share certificates are MedLink Nominees holding 500 shares on trust for PHL, MedLink Trustees holding another 500 shares on trust for PHL and EMU holding 4000 shares - which constitutes the entire issued share capital of the Claimant. Under Cypriot law, all shareholders of the Claimant must be registered in the Register of Members of the Claimant. Only a registered shareholder can claim to be a legal and beneficial owner of Claimant's shares. No instruments of transfer of the Claimant's shares have been remitted to Dolsamex or Mr. O'Neill, which means they cannot be registered as the shareholders of the Claimant in Cyprus. Absent instruments of transfer and the registration of shareholding, neither Dolsamex nor Mr. O'Neill can lay claim to ownership of any shares of the Claimant.\n\n78.\n\nIf the Swiss litigation were decided in favor of Dolsamex and Mr. O'Neill, the Claimant argues, they can only be awarded rights over the 1000 shares held by PHL, i.e., twenty percent of the Claimant's shares, since EMU holds the other 4000 shares of the Claimant. In addition, says the Claimant, if Dolsamex and Mr. O'Neill did or do own or control the Claimant, the latter will still be owned or controlled by ECT nationals and, therefore, not meet the conditions for application of Article 17(1) ECT. Mr. O'Neill is a French national, and the other owners of Dolsamex are Bulgarian nationals. Even if Bulgarian nationals cannot bring ECT claims directly against Bulgaria, as the Respondent alleges, they can bring claims as ultimate owners and controllers of a company incorporated in Cyprus as they, too, are ECT nationals and do not meet the conditions of application of Article 17(1) ECT.\n\n79.\n\nAs regards the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, the Claimant contends that the scope of the MFN clause in that treaty extends to dispute settlement and that by operation of the MFN clause, the dispute resolution provisions of other Bulgarian BITs such as the Bulgaria-Finland BIT of 3 October 1997, which provides for the possibility of ICSID arbitration, are imported into the Bulgarian-Cyprus BIT. The Respondent has, therefore, through the MFN provision, consented to submit investment disputes with investors of Cyprus to ICSID arbitration regardless of the scope of the dispute resolution provision in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT; and none of the policy exceptions to the operation of the MFN clause relied upon by the Respondent applies in this case.\n\n80.\n\nSlightly modifying the requests for relief by comparison with those in its CounterMemorial, the Claimant added a new paragraph (ii) requesting that the Arbitral Tribunal issue a decision:\n\n*(ii) Denying the application of Article 17(1) to the dispute on the grounds that the conditions of application of that provision are not satisfied.*\n\nOtherwise, the Claimant's requests for relief remain the same as in the CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n**E. The Hearing on 20 and 21 September 2004**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAt a hearing on 20 and 21 September 2004, Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin was examined and cross-examined by the parties' counsel. There followed oral presentation by each side of its respective case.\n\n1. The Respondent's Arguments\n-----------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments were presented in three parts: (1) the Dolsamex/O'Neill litigations and their incidence on the ownership of PCL; (2) the ECT and Article 17(1); and (3) the MFN issue. The Respondent also requested an award of costs for the jurisdiction phase of the arbitration.\n\n83.\n\nWith respect to the Dolsamex/O'Neill litigations, the Respondent argued that they cast a cloud over the ownership of PCL such that it is impossible to find with adequate assurance that PCL is even present in this arbitration. This uncertainty makes it impossible for the Claimant to satisfy the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention3 because it cannot be found with adequate assurance that PCL has consented to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration. If this arbitration is allowed to proceed, according the Respondent, and it is ultimately found that Mr. Vautrin does not actually own PCL, Bulgaria stands exposed to the risk of another claim by the true owners for the same events alleged in this arbitration.\n\nSee paragraph 25 *supra.*\n\n84.\n\nRegarding Article 17(1) ECT, the Respondent said that this \"denial of benefit provision means that a Contracting State is not obligated to extend any treaty protections to a national that does not have a meaningful link with the other Contracting State. Article 17(1) gives to the Contracting State an option to provide ECT Part III benefits or not when the circumstances described in that article exist. Its purpose is to provide states with flexibility to determine when such a denial of benefits is warranted. Article 17 does not require a Contracting State to give advance notice of denial of benefits to an investor: Article 17 is itself a notice. The Claimant is wrong when it interprets the ECT as obligating Contracting States to provide all of the Treaty's advantages in all circumstances unless and until they decide affirmatively to deny. A company which falls afoul of Article 17 conditions has, according to the Respondent, no reasonable expectation that the ECT obligations are owing to it because States are not bound to provide those advantages in that circumstance; the investor in that situation knows from the outset that it has no ECT rights. There is, thus, no retroactive effect as the Claimant argues. Moreover, Article 26 ECT, the dispute resolution provision, is not binding on a State vis-\u00e0-vis an investor which falls afoul of Article 17.\n\n85.\n\nIt was the Respondent's submission at the hearing that Article 17 operates to defeat jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and/or Article 26 ECT. To establish Bulgaria's consent to ICSID arbitration, there must be a dispute that concerns an alleged breach of an ECT Part III obligation. If the Arbitral Tribunal were to decide that the circumstances are present to satisfy an Article 17(1) denial, then the facts alleged by the Claimant necessarily would be incapable of forming the basis of a claim that ECT Part III has been breached. In that circumstance, Article 17(1) operates to defeat Bulgaria's consent, which extends only to disputes involving a possible breach of Part III and would operate to defeat jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. There would be no substantive obligations applicable in the relationship between the parties which would be capable of forming the basis of a legal dispute as required by the ICSID Convention.\n\n86.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contended, Article 17 ECT was intended to have the effect of denying all the benefits that flow from claims espousal as expressed in the investment treatment portion of the ECT. A principal benefit of Part III is that ECT Part V expressly provides a dispute resolution mechanism for breaches.\n\n87.\n\nTurning to the issue of Mr. Vautrin's ownership and control of PCL, the Respondent argued that Mr. Vautrin's resistance to disclose fully and openly what the ownership of PCL is raises serious doubts as to the credibility and reliability of the information he has now given as to ownership. The Respondent pointed to inconsistencies in and unanswered questions raised by the documents in evidence. Reference was made to pledge agreements only recently produced by the Claimant in which the shares of EMU were pledged by two Seychelles companies, Panorama Industrial Limited (\"Panorama\") and Allspice Limited (\"Allspice\"), stating that they were the owners of the shares, which also casts doubt on the ultimate ownership of PCL.\n\n88.\n\nEven if the Arbitral Tribunal were to find that Mr. Vautrin is the ultimate owner of PCL, the Respondent argued, the Claimant obtained the right to acquire its investment in Bulgaria by intentionally misleading the Bulgarian government regarding the ownership of PCL, the investor, in order to obtain the consent of its Privatization Agency. Bulgaria objects to jurisdiction on the ground that none of the protections of the ECT, the Cyprus-Bulgaria BIT or the ICSID Convention can be used by a the Claimant that obtained its investments through fraudulent misrepresentations. The consent of Bulgaria to the underlying investment, and, therefore, the Claimant's purchase of Nova Plama shares are void as a matter of Bulgarian law. The Claimant does not own the shares of Nova Plama, and consequently it has no investment in Bulgaria under any of the applicable treaties.\n\n89.\n\nFinally, the Respondent addressed the MFN issue, arguing that the MFN clause in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT could not be used to import into that BIT from another treaty a forum for dispute resolution different from the forum designated in that BIT.\n\n2. The Claimant's Arguments\n---------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant pointed out that PCL, as a company incorporated in Cyprus, is a covered investor under the ECT, under the definition in Article 1(7) ECT. By buying Nova Plama, PCL made an investment in Bulgaria falling within the definition in Article 1(6) ECT. In Part III of the ECT, Bulgaria committed itself to protect covered investments by covered investors of other contracting parties such as Cyprus. And in Article 26 ECT, Bulgaria consented to ICSID arbitration of disputes such as those subject of the present arbitration.\n\n91.\n\nIn reply to the Respondent's contention that Bulgaria's consent to arbitrate disputes must concern an alleged breach of an obligation under ECT Part III and that there is no such obligation in this case, the Claimant argued that PCL, as a covered investor with a covered investment, enjoys Part III protections until they are validly denied. Bulgaria only purported to deny benefits on 18 February 2003; prior thereto it had owed PCL Part III obligations for over four years during which time it had committed the breaches of the ECT alleged by the Claimant. By 18 February 2003, both parties had perfected their consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 26 ECT concerning those alleged breaches, which consent cannot be unilaterally withdrawn under the ICSID Convention.\n\n92.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant argued, Article 17(1) ECT cannot apply because a third State national does not own or control PCL. In this respect, the Claimant repeated what it had said earlier in the arbitration, that it accepted that PCL has no substantial business activities in Cyprus [D2.8]4. Counsel for the Claimant proceeded to describe the facts which he said showed that Mr. Vautrin has ultimately owned and controlled PCL at all times after the acquisition of Nova Plama.\n\nReferences to the Transcript of the Hearing on 20-21 September 2004 are to Day 1 or 2 followed by the page number of the transcript of that day's hearing\n\n93.\n\nDuring this presentation, the Claimant's counsel explained, as had Mr. Vautrin in his testimony, that pledge agreements of 13 November 2002, by which Mr. Nordtomme was depository of all of EMU shares on behalf of their owners, Panorama and Allspice, were never consummated; and the shares were never transferred to Panorama and Allspice. But even if they had been, these entities were beneficially owned by Mr. Vautrin; so that would have changed nothing.\n\n94.\n\nWith respect to the issue of alleged misrepresentation by PCL vis-\u00e0-vis Bulgaria at the time of its purchase of Nova Plama's shares, the Claimant did not necessarily dispute that Bulgaria understood at the time that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were the owners of PCL. Neither Andr\u00e9 nor NOT, and certainly not Mr. Vautrin who wanted to keep his ownership of PCL confidential, saw any need to correct Bulgaria's understanding. However, the Claimant pointed out that Mr. Vautrin and Mr. Nordtomme had both testified that during the pre-closing negotiations they told Bulgarian officials that Andr\u00e9 and NOT had withdrawn. There was no requirement that Mr. Vautrin disclose that he was the owner of PCL. There is no false representation as to ownership of PCL, the Claimants asserted, but at most an incorrect understanding by Bulgaria.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant went on to argue that Mr. Vautrin's control over PCL is demonstrated by the fact that the directors and secretaries of PCL were all lawyers or nominee companies who took their instructions from Mr. Vautrin or his lawyers.\n\n96.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's argument that, because of the Dolsamex/O'Neill litigations and the cloud they cast over Mr. Vautrin's ownership of PCL, PCL may not have validly given its consent to arbitration, the Claimant replied that it is the directors of PCL, not the shareholders, who have power to authorize the company to commence an arbitration, which they did. The ownership of PCL is, therefore, irrelevant to the validity of PCL's consent to arbitration.\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimant asserted that Dolsamex did not have a valid claim to ownership of PCL, but that even if it were the owner it is principally held by Bulgarian nationals, and, consequently, Article 17(1) ECT does not apply. Moreover, even if Dolsamex had a valid claim, that claim would relate only to 20% of PCL's capital.\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimant explained again its interpretation of Article 17(1) ECT as reserving the right of a Contracting State to deny ECT benefits to certain investors. Until the Contracting State exercises that right - and Bulgaria did so only on 18 February 2003 - the protections of the ECT are owed to the investor. Since the Claimant's Request for Arbitration was filed on 19 December 2002, Bulgaria's purported denial of benefits took place after the Claimant's consent to arbitration was effected and can have no effect on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant reiterated its contention that pursuant to the MFN clause of the Bulgarian-Cyprus BIT, PCL benefits from the more favorable provisions of other Bulgarian BITs, such as the Bulgaria-Finland BIT, permitting dispute resolution under ICSID. The argument was that PCL is an investor under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, that that BIT contains an MFN provision which applies to all aspects of \"treatment\" and that treatment refers not only to substantive provisions of other BITs but to settlement of dispute provisions as well. It is more favorable treatment than the restrictive recourse to arbitration in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT for an investor to have, as is provided in other Bulgarian BITs, a choice of fora for its arbitration and to have the merits of a dispute settled by arbitration rather than only the quantum of damages.\n\n**F. Post-Hearing Submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n1. The Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission\n-------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent filed a post-hearing submission on jurisdiction dated 22 October 2004.\n\n101.\n\nThe documents produced by the Claimant on 26 August, 6 September and 13 September 2004, says the Respondent, do not support the Claimant's claim that Mr. Vautrin owned and controlled PCL from the outset. On the contrary, the documents show that other entities and individuals have had ownership and control interests in PCL, such as Panorama and Allspice, Andr\u00e9, Forus, and Russian financiers acting through Forus and Mr. Bonev. At best, the Claimant's evidence supporting its claim of Mr. Vautrin's ownership and control is uncertain and conflicting. As such, it cannot support the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n102.\n\nMoreover, the documents demonstrate that if the Claimant is correct that Mr. Vautrin owns and controls the Claimant, it acquired its investment in Bulgaria through misrepresentations to the Government of Bulgaria and is not entitled to the protections of any of the treaties at issue in this case. The Claimant never disclosed to Bulgaria that Andr\u00e9 and NOT did not intend to purchase the shares of Nova Plama and that Mr. Vautrin intended instead to purchase them in his personal capacity.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that since the ownership and control of the Claimant is subject to ongoing litigation with Dolsamex and Mr. O'Neill, it is impossible to determine the ownership and control of the Claimant as required by Article 17(1) ECT - or even whether the person(s) purporting to act on behalf of the Claimant in commencing this arbitration is (are) properly authorized to do so.\n\n104.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submitted the costs it has incurred in respect of its jurisdictional objections amounting to US$ 2,679,400. It requested that it be awarded all these costs.\n\n2. The Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission\n-----------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Post-Hearing Response on 19 November 2004. The Claimant complained, in that Response, that the Respondent had ignored the Tribunal's directions given at the September 2004 hearing by not limiting itself in its post-hearing submission to arguments concerning the Claimant's document production prior to the hearing. The Claimant, therefore, requested the Tribunal to disregard the Respondent's submission other than as it relates to such documents.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant's submission argues that the documents it has produced in this arbitration do not show that a non-ECT national owned or controlled PCL and do not allow the Respondent to discharge its burden of proving that the factual conditions of Article 17(1) ECT are satisfied. The documents rather confirm that it is Mr. Vautrin who owned and controlled PCL at all relevant times. At no time did Panorama, Allspice, Andr\u00e9, Mr. Bonev, Ms. Guichoud, Messrs. Vassiliades and Co., Mr. Nordtomme or anyone else own or control PCL.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant submitted information regarding litigation in Bulgaria relevant to the claim by Mr. O'Neill and Dolsamex of ownership of PCL shares.\n\n108.\n\nAs regards Bulgaria's allegations that PCL's investment in Nova Plama was obtained through misrepresentations to the Bulgarian authorities, the Claimant argues that this allegation was first raised as an objection to jurisdiction at the September 2004 hearing, too late, it says, for the Tribunal to consider it. In any event, the Claimant asserts that there was no misrepresentation by the Claimant as to the ownership of PCL, as ownership of PCL was not an issue at the time of the acquisition. Since it was not then an issue, there was no requirement for disclosure of that ownership.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimant submits a claim for costs of US$ 1,256,775.49. It argues that costs should follow a decision by the Tribunal in PCL's favor, that the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration could have been avoided or abbreviated with more cooperation from the Respondent, and that PCL is impecunious as a result of Bulgaria's unlawful conduct and, therefore, in urgent need of financial relief. It attacks the Respondent's claim for costs as excessive.\n\n3. The Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply\n--------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply was filed on 3 December 2004. In the Reply, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's charge that costs claimed by it are excessive. The Respondent had to bear high costs, it argues, because the Claimant refused to disclose information in its possession and, thereby, needlessly aggravated the costs to Bulgaria of having itself to find relevant information.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes the Claimant's allegations regarding recent Bulgarian court orders relevant to the claims of Dolsamex and Mr. O'Neill as patently incorrect.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent's reply reiterates and defends its request to be awarded costs and asks the Arbitral Tribunal to deny the Claimant's request for an award of costs in the Claimant's favor.\n\n113.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertions that the Respondent's PostHearing Submission went beyond the scope of the Tribunal's directions.\n\n114.\n\nIn a letter to the Tribunal dated 8 December 2004, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply on grounds that it makes arguments entirely unrelated to the Claimant's costs and submits new documents, contrary to the Tribunal's directions. The Claimant requests the Tribunal to disregard all submissions made by the Respondent in its Post-Hearing Reply except those on costs and to disregard new documents submitted.\n\n115.\n\nWith regard to all the foregoing arguments, the parties cite the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, rules of international law, decisions of courts and arbitral tribunals and learned authors to support their respective provisions. The Arbitral Tribunal will, in the course of its examination of the parties' arguments below, discuss the law and jurisprudence and their applicability to the facts of the present case. The Tribunal adds that while Part V of this Decision summarizes the principal arguments of the parties, other arguments were made and considered by the Tribunal and will be referred to later to the extent the Tribunal considers them relevant to its decision.\n\n**IV. EXAMINATION OF THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal is required to decide the Respondent's objection, under Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules that the present dispute and the Claimant's claims are not within the competence or jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the Centre. The Claimant contends that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is established under three instruments referred to at the outset of this Decision: (a) the Energy Charter Treaty (the \"ECT\"); (b) the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Bulgaria and Cyprus (\"the BIT\"); and (c) the ICSID Convention (\"the ICSID Convention\"). The Claimant also contends that the Tribunal's jurisdiction can be established under either the ECT or the BIT as alternatives. It is therefore appropriate below for the Tribunal to consider the ECT and the BIT separately in turn, although the ICSID Convention is relevant to both.\n\n117.\n\n*Applicable Law:* All three instruments are treaties under international law; and their interpretation is governed by rules of international law, expressed in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 quoted in paragraph 26 *supra*. Under Article 31(1), the general rule requires a treaty to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their \"context\" and in the light of the treaty's \"object\" and \"purpose\"; Article 31(2) defines \"context\"; and the remaining provisions of Articles 31 and 32 provide further means of interpretation as applicable. The Tribunal considers these provisions in more detail below.\n\n118.\n\n*Burden of Proof* : As regards the burden of proof on the Respondent's jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal adopts the test proffered by Judge Higgins in her separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms Case*5. In addressing the question, \"what is the test by which the Court is to make its finding\" in face of a preliminary objection to its jurisdiction on grounds that a party's claims do not fall under the treaty invoked, Judge Higgins cited the *Mavrommatis Case*6, in which the International Court of Justice held that in the absence of any test set forth in the treaty or in the rules governing the Court itself, the Court was *\"at liberty to adopt the principle which it considers best calculated to ensure the administration of justice, most suited to procedure before an* *international tribunal and most in conformity with the fundamental principles of international law\"* (para. 28 of the separate opinion). The learned Judge continued:\n\n*The only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims of [Claimant] are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept pro tem the facts as alleged by [Claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret Articles I, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes, that* *is to say, to see if on the basis of Iran's claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.* (para. 32).\n\nStated in another way, the principle Judge Higgins proposed was the following:\n\n*The Court should... see if, on the facts as alleged by Claimant], the [Respondent's] actions complained of might violate the Treaty articles (\u00a7 33)... Nothing in this approach puts at risk the obligation of the Court to keep separate the jurisdictional and merits phases... and to protect the integrity of the proceedings on the merits... what is for the merits,* *(and which remains pristine and untouched by this approach to the jurisdictional issue) is to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of...[the treaty] and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation... In short it is at the merits that one sees 'whether there really has been a breach'.* (para. 34).\n\nCase concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), 1996, ICJ Reports 803, at 810).\n\nMavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgement N\u00b0 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A. N\u00b0 2, p. 16.\n\n119.\n\nThis approach has subsequently been followed by several international arbitration tribunals deciding jurisdictional objections by a respondent state against a claimant investor, including *Methanex v USA*, *SGS v Philippines* and *Salini v Jordan*. In the last of these cases7, the tribunal decided that it was up to the claimant to present its own case as it saw fit; that, in doing so, the claimant must show that the alleged facts on which it relied were capable of falling within the provisions of the treaty (paras. 131 *et. seq.*); and that:\n\n*In considering issues of jurisdiction, courts and tribunals do not go into the merits of the case without sufficient prior debate. In conformity with this jurisprudence, the Tribunal will accordingly seek to determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimant in this case, if established, are capable of* *coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.* (para. 151) *.*\n\nThis Tribunal does not understand that Judge Higgins' approach is in any sense controversial, either at large or as between the parties to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Tribunal applies this approach to the jurisdictional issues considered below.\n\nSalini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Award of 15 November 2004, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n120.\n\nAs regards the burden proof on other issues, relating to the merits and not to jurisdiction, the Tribunal cannot apply the same approach; and the parties' request that the Tribunal should decide such issues at this early stage of these proceedings has created certain difficulties. In particular, there was a significant difference between the parties as to which of them bore the burden of proof on disputed facts; and there was no agreement on the standard of proof or (as the Respondent contended but the Claimant denied) whether and how far it was appropriate for the Tribunal to draw any adverse inferences against the Claimant. As applicable, the Tribunal returns to these difficulties in more detail below.\n\n**A. The Energy Charter Treaty**\n--------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant here rests its case on Article 26 ECT. Part V of the ECT regulates the settlements of disputes, with Article 26 providing for state-investor disputes and Article 27 for state-state disputes. In relevant part taken from the ECT's English version, Article 26 (1), (2) and (4) provide: \" *Disputes between a Contracting Party* *and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in* *the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably\";* and if not so amicably settled within a period of three months, *\"the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution\"* to, *inter alia*, international arbitration under the ICSID Convention. Article 26 is limited to the state's obligations under Part III ECT; whereas state-state arbitration under Article 27 is not so limited. (The text of Article 26 is more fully set out in paragraph 26 of this Decision, *supra*). The ECT was the first multilateral treaty to provide as a general rule the settlement of investor-state disputes by international arbitration; and to date, it has been signed by at least 51 states and the European Communities.\n\n1. Qualifying Definitions\n-------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIt is necessary first to address the definition of certain terms used in Article 26: \"Contracting Parties\", \"Investor\", \"Investment\" and \"alleged breach\".\n\n123.\n\n*Contracting Parties:* Bulgaria is a \"Contracting Party\" within the definition provided by Article 1(2) ECT, as a state having consented to be bound by the ECT and for which the ECT is in force, having ratified the ECT on 15 November 1996. Cyprus and France are also Contracting Parties, having ratified the ECT on 16 January 1998 and 28 September 1999 respectively.\n\n124.\n\n*Investor:* The Claimant is an \"Investor of another Contracting Party\" within the definition provided by Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT, being a company organized in accordance with the law applicable in Cyprus. With its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant produced a certificate dated 29 March 2002 from Cyprus' Department of Registrar of Companies, certifying that in accordance with its records, the Claimant was registered on 2 September 1998 and remained on its register (Exhibit C6).\n\n125.\n\n*Investment:* There is undoubtedly a dispute between the Respondent and the Claimant, the first relevant issue being whether the dispute relates to the Claimant's \"Investment in the Area\" of Bulgaria. As defined by Article 1(6) ECT, *\"\u2018Investment' means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor\";* and there follows a broad, non-exhaustive list of different kinds of assets encompassing virtually any right, property or interest in money or money's worth, including *\"(b)... shares, stock or other forms of equity participation in a company...\"*. As defined by Article 1(10), *\"\u2018Area' means with respect to any state that is a Contracting Party (a) the territory under its sovereignty\".* The Claimant asserts that its substantial shareholding in Nova Plama, as a company carrying on business in Bulgaria, qualifies as an \"Investment\". The Claimant produced with its Request for Arbitration a temporary shareholding certificate endorsed on 18 December 1998 showing a transfer of 4,976,377 shares of Nova Plama to the Claimant (Exhibit C4) and a temporary shareholding certificate also endorsed on 18 December 1998 showing a further transfer of 44,862,472 of Nova Plama's shares to the Claimant (Exhibit C5). As recorded in Paragraph 19 of this Decision (*supra*), those shares represented 96.78% of Nova Plama's share capital.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent contended, at the September hearing, that there was no \"Investment\" under Article 1(6) ECT because the Claimant had materially misrepresented or willfully failed to disclose the Claimant's true ownership to the Bulgarian authorities in violation of Bulgarian law. Accordingly, Bulgaria's Privatization Agency's consent to the Claimant's purchase of Nova Plama shares was null and void under Bulgarian law; and it followed that the Claimant had never made any valid investment. This particular submission had not been advanced before the September Hearing. In paragraph 80 of its Reply (p. 34), the Respondent had stated that it \" *reserves the right,* *should the Tribunal sustain jurisdiction on the basis that Mr. Vautrin was at all times* *the sole owner of PCL, to raise an objection relating to whether Claimant's investment was made in accordance with law\"*. Subsequently, after receiving the Claimant's Rejoinder of 26 August 2004 and hearing Mr. Vautrin's further testimony at the September Hearing, Bulgaria's Counsel stated that it was now making its objection and \"exercising that right\" [D1,227-229].\n\n127.\n\nAs understood by the Tribunal, as a jurisdictional objection, this submission is distinct from albeit factually similar to the broader case advanced by the Respondent on \"misrepresentation\", which the Tribunal considers separately below. In any event, it was also subject to the Claimant's procedural complaint recorded at the September Hearing [D2.56]. It is however appropriate to decide this particular submission here because, in the Tribunal's view, it necessarily fails *in limine* as a jurisdictional challenge on several grounds.\n\n128.\n\nFirst, whatever the eventual merits of the Respondent's \"misrepresentation\" case (which is denied by the Claimant), it remains the case that the Claimant was an \"Investor\" under Article 1(7) ECT: it is here irrelevant who owns or controls the Claimant at any material time. The definition of \"Investment\" under Article 1(6) refers to the Investor's investment, in other words it is again here irrelevant who owns or controls the Claimant at any material time; and as already noted above, the definition is broad, extending to \" *any right conferred by law or contract* \". That definition would be satisfied by a contractual or property right even if it were defeasible. Applying Judge Higgins' approach to disputed facts, the Tribunal must accept, *pro tem*, the investment as alleged by the Claimant; and on this ground alone, the Tribunal decides that Bulgaria's submission fails.\n\n129.\n\nSecond, it is clear that no point was taken by the Respondent on the validity of the Privatization Agency's consent as a jurisdictional point until the September Hearing. In particular, as at the time of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration of 24 December 2002 and the Respondent's Memorial of 26 May 2004, the Claimant's investment as an \"Investment\" under Article 1(6) ECT had not been impugned by the Respondent, no attempt having been made to avoid or to treat as null and void under Bulgarian law the Privatization Agency's consent. In these circumstances, the actual state of the Privatization Agency's consent under Bulgarian law and its effect on the Claimant's investment remains unclear to the Tribunal. The Tribunal here expresses no criticism of either party's conduct; but it decides that this submission cannot be admitted so belatedly as a jurisdictional challenge. This decision is limited to this jurisdictional submission; and in particular it does not extend to the merits of the Respondent's case on \"misrepresentation\".\n\n130.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent's charges of misrepresentation are not directed specifically at the parties' agreement to arbitrate found in Article 26 ECT. The alleged misrepresentation relates to the transaction involving the sale of the shares of Nova Plama by EEH to PCL and the approval thereof given by Bulgaria in the Privatization Agreement and elsewhere. It is not in these documents that the agreement to arbitrate is found. Bulgaria's agreement to arbitrate is found in the ECT, a multilateral treaty, a completely separate document. The Respondent has not alleged that the Claimant's purported misrepresentation nullified the ECT or its consent to arbitrate contained in the ECT. Thus not only are the dispute settlement provisions of the ECT, including Article 26, autonomous and separable from Part III of that Treaty but they are independent of the entire Nova Plama transaction; so even if the parties' agreement regarding the purchase of Nova Plama is arguably invalid because of misrepresentation by the Claimant, the agreement to arbitrate remains effective.\n\n131.\n\nAccordingly, in the Tribunal's view, the present dispute does relate to an \"Investment\" by the Claimant as an \"Investor\" in Bulgaria's \"Area\".\n\n132.\n\n*Alleged Breach:* The next issue is whether the parties' present dispute concerns \"an alleged breach of an obligation of [the Respondent] under Part III\". Part III ECT is the chapter entitled \"Investment, Promotion and Protection\", containing the ECT's principal substantive protections for Investors, including Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments, Compensation for Losses, Key Personnel and Expropriation under Articles 10, 12 and 13 ECT, respectively. It is self-evident from the Claimant's written and oral submissions to date that it is \"alleging\" violations by the Respondent of several provisions in Part III of the ECT. For example, the Claimant pleads as its \"principal causes of action\" Articles 10, 12 and 13 ECT in paragraphs 127 and 130144 of its Request for Arbitration. These are all alleged breaches of the Respondent's obligations under Part III of the ECT. In the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary, at this jurisdictional stage of the proceedings, for the Claimant to prove positively actual violations by the Respondent: the unambiguous wording in Article 26 ECT is met by the Claimant's *allegations* of such violations. Referring again to Judge Higgins' test in *Oil Platforms*, if on the facts alleged by the Claimant, the Respondent's actions might violate the ECT, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine exactly what the facts are and see whether they do sustain a violation of that Treaty.\n\n2. The Claimant's \"Consent\"\n---------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it validly exercised its right under Article 26 ECT in referring its disputes with the Respondent to ICSID Arbitration; and that its own \"consent in writing\" expressly submitting to ICSID's jurisdiction, as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, is contained in paragraphs 109-111 of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration, which was confirmed by the Claimant's letter dated 24 December 2002 to the Respondent (Exhibit C15). As recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Claimant's board of directors dated 11 November 2002, the board resolved that Mr. Nordtomme *(inter alios)* be entrusted to bring ICSID arbitration proceedings against the Respondent (Exhibit C19); and a power of attorney to that end was granted by the Claimant to Mr. Nordtomme also dated 11 November 2002. The Claimant's Request for Arbitration and the Claimant's letter dated 24 December 2002 were both signed by Mr. Nordtomme as attorney for the Claimant; and by profession, Mr. Nordtomme is a practicing attorney from Oslo, Norway.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the validity of this exercise and expression of consent in the Claimant's name on the ground that the persons purporting to act for the Claimant were not entitled or authorized to do so. This submission is based on the disputed ownership of shares in the Claimant as between Dolsamex, Mr. O'Neill and PHL. (This is a different submission from, albeit not factually dissimilar to, the issue addressed below relating to Article 17(1)'s first limb on the Claimant's continuous ownership and control.)\n\n135.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the issue raised by the Respondent must be dismissed on two cumulative grounds. First, the relevant exercise and consent were made by the Claimant acting through its duly appointed corporate organs of management and duly authorized attorney. It was not performed by the Claimant's shareholders or persons purporting to act as shareholders. The Claimant's articles of association incorporate Table A of the Companies Act of Cyprus, whereby the Claimant's board of directors is granted the general power to manage the Claimant, including the right to bring legal or arbitration proceedings in the company's name. That power is not granted to the Claimant's shareholders; and accordingly, any dispute over the Claimant's share ownership is irrelevant to the legal validity of the acts undertaken in the Claimant's name by its duly authorized and appointed managers and agents for the time being. It is not suggested, nor could it be on the materials currently before the Tribunal, that the appointment of the Claimant's board members or the power of attorney granted to Mr. Nordtomme were otherwise invalid.\n\n136.\n\nSecond, the litigation between Dolsamex, Mr. O'Neill and PHL over the Claimant's share ownership remains unresolved in the Swiss and Bulgarian Courts; and those unresolved disputes, still months if not years from their final end, cannot by themselves invalidate the otherwise valid acts of the Claimant's managers and attorneys. Of course, if the disputes were to be finally resolved adversely to PHL in the future, that might then lead to a significant change in the composition of the Claimant's board and the continuing authority of its attorneys; but these changes would operate only for the future; and neither, by themselves, could render invalid retrospectively what had otherwise been done validly at the time in the Claimant's name. Nor would the change of ownership or of the board of the Claimant affect any decision rendered by this Tribunal, which will be *res judicata* between PCL and Bulgaria.\n\n137.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that there was a valid exercise by the Claimant of its right to refer its dispute with the Respondent to ICSID under Article 26 ECT and that it validly made the requisite written consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3. The Respondent's \"Consent\"\n-----------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Bulgaria's signature and accession to the ECT constitutes the Respondent's \"consent in writing\" to ICSID arbitration, required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. It submits that Article 26 ECT contains a standing, open written offer of (*inter alia*) ICSID arbitration by Contracting States to Investors of other Contracting States. By filing its Request for Arbitration, as already noted, the Claimant accepted that offer; and having given its own written consent to arbitration under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal's jurisdiction is established under the ICSID Convention and Article 26 ECT.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent counters that to establish Bulgaria's consent to ICSID arbitration, there must be a dispute that concerns an alleged breach of an ECT Part III obligation. The conditions of Article 17(1) ECT having been fulfilled, according to the Respondent, there can be no claim of a breach of Part III and no consent of Bulgaria to arbitrate any such claim.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimant's analysis of the ECT and ICSID Convention of investor-state arbitration; but for purposes which will appear later, it wishes to emphasize several characteristics of the parties' arbitration agreement created by these two instruments. First, Article 26(3)(a) ECT provides that the Contracting Parties thereby give their \"unconditional assent\" to such state-investor arbitration (subject to specific exceptions which are here immaterial); and accordingly, as a Contracting Party, the Respondent thereby expressed unconditionally its written consent required under the ICSID Convention. Second, Article 46 ECT provides that no reservations may be made to the ECT; none were in fact made in regard to Article 26 by Bulgaria; and accordingly Bulgaria's consent was unreserved. Third, under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, when the parties have given their consent, no party \"may withdraw its consent unilaterally\"; and accordingly the Respondent's consent was also irrevocable from the date of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration. Lastly, Article 45(1) ECT provides that each signatory agrees to apply the treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory; and in accordance with Article 25 of the Vienna Convention, it follows that Article 26 ECT provisionally applied from the date of a state's signature, unless that state declared itself exempt from provisional application under Article 45(2)(a) ECT. (Bulgaria made no such declaration).\n\n141.\n\nFor all these reasons, Article 26 ECT provides to a covered investor an almost unprecedented remedy for its claim against a host state. The ECT has been described, together with NAFTA, as *\"the major multilateral treaty pioneering the extensive use of legal methods characteristic of the fledging regulation of the global economy\"*, of which *\"perhaps the most important aspect of the ECT's investment regime is the provision for compulsory arbitration against governments at the option of foreign investors...\"* ; and these same distinguished commentators concluded: *\"With a paradigm shift away from mere protection by the home state of investors and traders to the legal architecture of a liberal global economy, goes a coordinated use of trade and investment law methods to achieve the same objective: a global level playing field for activities in competitive markets\"*8. By any standards, Article 26 is a very important feature of the ECT which is itself a very significant treaty for investors, marking another step in their transition from objects to subjects of international law.\n\nBamberger, Lineham and W\u00e4lde, The Energy Charter Treaty in 2000 (in Energy Law in Europe, ed Roggenkamp; 2000), pp. 11, 31 and 32 (Legal Appendix to Reply, Exhibit 73).\n\n4. The Tribunal's Conditional Conclusion on Article 26 ECT\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nIn conclusion, subject to the major issue raised by the Respondent on Article 17(1) ECT (which is considered below), it follows from the decisions so far that this Tribunal decides that it would have jurisdiction to determine on its merits the present dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent under Article 26 ECT and the ICSID Convention, and that both parties to the dispute have given their written consent thereto within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5. Article 17 ECT\n-----------------\n\n143.\n\nArticle 17 ECT is contained in Part III of the ECT, the same part containing the ECT's substantive protections for Investors but a different part from Part V containing the provisions for dispute settlement. Article 17 is entitled \"Non-Application of Part III in Certain Circumstances\"; and taken from the ECT's English version, Article 17(1) provides: *\"Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part* [i.e., Part III] *to: (1) a legal entity [Limb i] if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and [Limb ii] if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organised;..*.\". The Tribunal attaches significance to the word \"and\" linking both limbs of Article 17(1), thereby requiring both to be satisfied. (For ease of reference below, the Tribunal has added in the quotation above the roman numerals in square brackets to indicate these first and second limbs). Article 17(2) ECT contains a similar provision for an \"Investment\" in differently specified circumstances. (The full text of Article 17 ECT is set out in paragraph 26 of this Decision, *supra).*\n\n144.\n\nBy letter dated 18 February 2003 to ICSID's Acting Secretary-General, the Respondent exercised its right under Article 17(1) ECT to deny the advantages of Part III to the Claimant, purportedly including the right to refer its claim to arbitration under Article 26 ECT, as follows: *\"The application of ECT shall be denied to the claimant since Plama Holding Limited [sic] has not provided any evidence that the ultimate owners of its shares are nationals or citizens of a Contracting State to ECT and that it has any substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organised, namely Cyprus.\"* (Exhibit C36). In a further letter dated 4 March 2003 to the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, the Respondent clarified its position: *\"... the clear and unambiguous wording of Article 17 of the ECT leaves no doubt that each [Contracting Party] has reserved this right with the conclusion of the ECT and that no prior or subsequent reservation is needed for its exercise... Consequently, Article 17 of the ECT confers on each [Contracting Party] a direct and unconditional right of denial which may be exercised at any time and in any manner.\"* (Exhibit C37).\n\n145.\n\nIt will be noted, as was emphasized by the Claimant in its submissions, that the language here first used by the Respondent apparently assumed (i) the need to \"exercise\" the right of denial and (ii) that its effect was prospective from the right's exercise (\"shall be denied\"), using the future tense to deny advantages to the Claimant as if for the future only. In that event the Claimant submitted that, even if Article 17(1) applied in the present case, given that the Claimant had already submitted its Request for Arbitration earlier on 24 December 2002, it could not deprive this Tribunal of any jurisdiction or even operate as a defense on the merits to any claims pleaded by the Claimant arising from still earlier events. It is necessary for the Tribunal to consider Bulgaria's submissions on Article 17(1) separately as regards jurisdiction and merits.\n\n6. Article 17 as a Jurisdictional Issue\n---------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe first question is whether any issue raised under Article 17(1) by Bulgaria can deprive this Tribunal of all jurisdiction to decide the merits of the parties' dispute. As already described in Section III of this Decision (*supra*), the Claimant submits that the Respondent's reliance on Article 17(1) can only relate to the merits and not to jurisdiction, whereas Bulgaria primarily contends the opposite. The Respondent contends that there can be no dispute over its obligations under Part III of the ECT when the Claimant has no relevant \"advantages\" under Part III legally capable of giving rise to any claim pleaded under Part III. The Respondent contends that the denial of such \"advantages\" are not limited to those conferred by Part III of the ECT but include also all advantages relating to Part III, including the right to invoke international arbitration under Article 26 of Part V of the ECT alleging any breach of Part III. In its counsel's words at the September Hearing: \" *it's the whole thing* \" [D1,160]; and as the Tribunal has already noted, unlike Article 27, Article 26 is a remedy limited to an alleged breach of Part III.\n\n147.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's jurisdictional case here turns on the effect of Articles 17(1) and 26 ECT, interpreted under Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. The express terms of Article 17 refer to a denial of the advantages \"of this Part\", thereby referring to the substantive advantages conferred upon an investor by Part III of the ECT. The language is unambiguous; but it is confirmed by the title to Article 17: \"Non-Application of *Part III* in Certain Circumstances\" (emphasis supplied). All authentic texts in the other five languages are to the same effect. From these terms, interpreted in good faith in accordance with their ordinary contextual meaning, the denial applies only to advantages under Part III. It would therefore require a gross manipulation of the language to make it refer to Article 26 in Part V of the ECT. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered whether any such manipulation is permissible in the light of the ECT's object and purpose.\n\n148.\n\nArticle 26 provides a procedural remedy for a covered investor's claims; and it is not physically or juridically part of the ECT's substantive advantages enjoyed by that investor under Part III. As a matter of language, it would have been simple to exclude a class of investors completely from the scope of the ECT as a whole, as do certain other bilateral investment treaties; but that is self-evidently not the approach taken in the ECT. This limited exclusion from Part III for a covered investor, dependent on certain specific criteria, requires a procedure to resolve a dispute as to whether that exclusion applies in any particular case; and the object and purpose of the ECT, in the Tribunal's view, clearly requires Article 26 to be unaffected by the operation of Article 17(1). As already noted above, for a covered investor, Article 26 is a very important feature of the ECT.\n\n149.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the contrary approach would clearly not accord with the ECT's object and purpose. Unlike most modern investment treaties, Article 17(1) does not operate as a denial of all benefits to a covered investor under the treaty but is expressly limited to a denial of the advantages of Part III of the ECT. A Contracting State can only deny these advantages if Article 17(1)'s specific criteria are satisfied; and it cannot validly exercise its right of denial otherwise. A disputed question of its valid exercise may arise, raising issues of treaty interpretation, other legal issues and issues of fact, particularly as regards the first and second limbs of Article 17(1) ECT. It is notorious that issues as to citizenship, nationality, ownership, control and the scope and location of business activities can raise wide-ranging, complex and highly controversial disputes, as in the present case. In the absence of Article 26 as a remedy available to the covered investor (as the Respondent contends), how are such disputes to be determined between the host state and the covered investor, given that such determination is crucial to both? According to the Respondent, there is no remedy available to a covered investor under the ECT at all: it has no advantages under the ECT at all; it has no rights under Article 26 to amicable negotiations or international arbitration; and any attempt to initiate arbitration before ICSID will be met with a demand by the host state that the request for arbitration should not be registered under Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention (as the Respondent contended in its letter dated 4 March 2003, cited above). Towards the covered investor, under the Respondent's case, the Contracting State invoking the application of Article 17(1) is the judge in its own cause. That is a license for injustice; and it treats a covered investor as if it were not covered under the ECT at all. It is not tempered, as the Respondent's counsel tentatively suggested at the September hearing, by the possibility that the Contracting State might choose, in its discretion, to extend in a friendly but wholly voluntary way any or all of the advantages of Part III during amicable negotiations with the aggrieved investor [D1,151ff].\n\n150.\n\nThis contrary approach also cannot be reconciled with Article 27 ECT on state-state arbitration. Under Article 27, a Contracting Party can refer to arbitration a dispute with the host state (as another Contracting Party) any dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the ECT, including the host state's exercise of its right of denial to a covered investor under Article 17(1) ECT. The Contracting Party's right to arbitration is unqualified by the host state's invocation of Article 17(1); and it follows that a Contracting Party could pursue a claim against the host state for its improper reliance on Article 17(1) towards a covered investor. In other words, even if (as the Respondent contends), the investor cannot invoke Article 26 at all, it would leave intact its home state's right, as a Contracting State, to invoke Article 27 against the host state. It seems an unnecessarily complicated result to resolve that dispute when, on the ordinary meaning of Article 17(1), the covered investor could invoke Article 26 directly against the host state without the assistance of its home state. The Tribunal notes again that for a covered investor, Article 26 is a very important feature of the ECT; and as a remedy exercisable by an investor by itself and in its own right against the host state, it cannot be equated with Article 27. Under the ECT, the covered investor is more than an object of international law (see *supra,* paragraph 139).\n\n151.\n\n*Conclusion:* For these reasons, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent's case on Article 17(1) cannot support a complaint to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in this case. It would ordinarily be appropriate to stop here as regards any further consideration of Article 17(1) ECT. However, for understandable reasons, both parties requested the Tribunal to decide upon the application or non-application of Article 17(1) ECT even if it did not relate to the Tribunal's jurisdiction but related to the merits of their dispute. Accordingly, the Tribunal now proceeds further to meet the parties' request.\n\n7. Article 17 as an Issue on the Merits\n---------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses this part of the parties' submissions on the assumption (as decided above) that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant's claims against the Respondent for one or more alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT. These submissions raise distinct issues of legal interpretation and related factual issues.\n\n153.\n\n*Exercise of the Right to Deny* : The Claimant contends first that where a Contracting State wishes to deny the advantages of Part III of the ECT to a legal entity under Article 17(1) ECT, that State must first exercise its right to deny such advantages or take equivalent positive action that it intends to do so; and further that the denial then operates only prospectively from the date of such exercise or other action. Accordingly, the legal entity enjoys in full the advantages of Part III of the ECT up to that date. In its counsel's words at the September Hearing: \"... *\u2018reserves the right',* *this means the right exists, but it's not yet exercised, the right to deny exists, but not* *the denial* \" [D2.65]; and reference was made to Professor W\u00e4lde's expert opinion filed by the Respondent in support of its Memorial on Jurisdiction to the effect that Article 17(1) provides an \"option\" for the Contracting State, thereby also suggesting the need for that option to be exercised by the state (at paragraph 62).\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent contends otherwise: first that Article 17(1) ECT requires no action by Bulgaria; and, second, whether or not it did, the denial of benefits would operate retrospectively. It contends that Article 17(1) is a so-called \"denial of benefits\" provision found in many modern investment treaties; that the principal feature of such treaties is the implementation, in a pragmatic way, of the home State's right under customary international law to provide diplomatic protection to its nationals through the mechanism of claims espousal against the host state; and that under such law, the host state is not obliged to entertain a claim presented by the home state unless there is a genuine and continuous link between that state and its national from the date of the alleged injury until the award settling the inter-state claim, relying on the ICJ's decision in the *Nottebohm Case*9.\n\nLiechtenstein v Guatemala, 1955 ICJ 4.\n\n155.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the existence of a \"right\" is distinct from the exercise of that right. For example, a party may have a contractual right to refer a claim to arbitration; but there can be no arbitration unless and until that right is exercised. In the same way, a Contracting Party has a right under Article 17(1) ECT to deny a covered investor the advantages under Part III; but it is not required to exercise that right; and it may never do so. The language of Article 17(1) is unambiguous; and that meaning is consistent with the different state practices of the ECT's Contracting States under different bilateral investment treaties: certain of them applying a generous approach to legal entities incorporated in a state with no significant business presence there (such as the Netherlands) and certain others applying a more restrictive approach (such as the USA). The ECT is a multilateral treaty with Article 17(1) drafted in permissive terms, not surprisingly, in order to accommodate these different state practices.\n\n156.\n\nMoreover, if the Respondent were correct, it is surprising that Article 17(1) should be drafted as it is: it would have been much easier to draft suitable wording to make the Respondent's meaning plain. For example, the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services of December 1995 provides in Article VI (\"Denial of Benefits\"):\n\n*The benefits of this Framework Agreement shall be denied to a service supplier who is a natural person of a non-Member State or a juridical person owned or controlled by persons of a non-Member State constituted under the laws of a Member State, but not engaged in substantive business operations in the territory of Member States(s).* (Exhibit C66).\n\nThat simple language requires no exercise or other action by a contracting state; and it leaves no room for ambiguity, even though this treaty is of a different type from the ECT. It requires little effort to imagine other similarly effective language which could have been used for Article 17(1) ECT - but which has not there been used. In these circumstances, it would clearly not be permissible for the Tribunal to re-write Article 17(1) ECT in the Respondent's favor.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered whether the requirement for the right's exercise is inconsistent with the ECT's object and purpose. The exercise would necessarily be associated with publicity or other notice so as to become reasonably available to investors and their advisers. To this end, a general declaration in a Contracting State's official gazette could suffice; or a statutory provision in a Contracting State's investment or other laws; or even an exchange of letters with a particular investor or class of investors. Given that in practice an investor must distinguish between Contracting States with different state practices, it is not unreasonable or impractical to interpret Article 17(1) as requiring that a Contracting State must exercise its right before applying it to an investor and be seen to have done so. By itself, Article 17(1) ECT is at best only half a notice; without further reasonable notice of its exercise by the host state, its terms tell the investor little; and for all practical purposes, something more is needed. The Tribunal was referred to Article 1113(2) NAFTA as an example of a term providing for the denial of benefits which provides for a form of prior notification and consultation; and whilst the wording is materially different from Article 17(1) ECT, this term does suggest that the Tribunal's interpretation is not unreasonable as a practical matter.\n\n158.\n\nFor these reasons, in the Tribunal's view, the interpretation of Article 17(1) ECT under Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires the right of denial to be exercised by the Contracting State. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides in the present case that the Respondent was required to exercise its right against the Claimant; and that it did so only on 18 February 2003, more than four years after the Claimant made its investment in Nova Plama. The real point at issue, therefore, is whether that exercise had retrospective effect to 1998 or only prospective effect from 2003, on the Claimant's \"advantages\" under Part III ECT.\n\n159.\n\n*Retrospective or Prospective Effect:* The language of Article 17(1) ECT is not by itself clear on this important point. There is some slight guidance from Article 17(1) suggesting a prospective effect, given the use of the present tense to coincide with the right's exercise (\"own or control\"... \"has no substantial activities\"... \"is organized\"); and likewise, Article 17(2) ECT suggests only a prospective effect to a denial of advantages to an Investment (\"... if the denying Contracting Party establishes...\" etc). However, the Tribunal would not wish to base its decision on such semantic indications only.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal returns to the object and purpose of the ECT under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The parties did not here invoke under Article 31(3) and (4) any subsequent agreement or practice between the ECT's Contracting Parties or under Article 32 any of the ECT's preparatory work. Accordingly, as with many issues of disputed interpretation turning on a relatively few words, it is a short point of almost first impression.\n\n161.\n\nThe covered investor enjoys the advantages of Part III unless the host state exercises its right under Article 17(1) ECT; and a putative covered investor has legitimate expectations of such advantages until that right's exercise. A putative investor therefore requires reasonable notice before making any investment in the host state whether or not that host state has exercised its right under Article 17(1) ECT. At that stage, the putative investor can so plan its business affairs to come within or without the criteria there specified, as it chooses. It can also plan not to make any investment at all or to make it elsewhere. After an investment is made in the host state, the \"hostagefactor\" is introduced; the covered investor's choices are accordingly more limited; and the investor is correspondingly more vulnerable to the host state's exercise of its right under Article 17(1) ECT. At this time, therefore, the covered investor needs at least the same protection as it enjoyed as a putative investor able to plan its investment. The ECT's express \"purpose\" under Article 2 ECT is the establishment of \" *... a legal framework in order to promote* *long-term* *co-operation in the energy field... in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter* \" (emphasis supplied). It is not easy to see how any retrospective effect is consistent with this \"long-term\" purpose.\n\n162.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, therefore, the object and purpose of the ECT suggest that the right's exercise should not have retrospective effect. A putative investor, properly informed and advised of the potential effect of Article 17(1), could adjust its plans accordingly prior to making its investment. If, however, the right's exercise had retrospective effect, the consequences for the investor would be serious. The investor could not plan in the \"long term\" for such an effect (if at all); and indeed such an unexercised right could lure putative investors with legitimate expectations only to have those expectations made retrospectively false at a much later date. Moreover, in the present case, the Respondent asserts a retrospective effect from a very late date, even after the Claimant's Request for Arbitration and the accrual of the Claimant's causes of action under Part III ECT.\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that by the very existence of Article 17(1) in the ECT, the Investor is put on notice before it makes its investment that it could be denied ECT advantages if it falls within that Article and, therefore, if it did so fall within Article 17(1) it would have no legitimate expectations of such advantages. Such an interpretation of the ECT would deprive the Investor of any certainty as to its rights and the host country's obligations when it makes its investment and must be rejected.\n\n164.\n\nFor the Investor, the practical difference between prospective and retrospective effect is sharp. The former accords with the good faith interpretation of the relevant wording of Article 17(1) in the light of the ECT's object and purpose; but the latter does not. Moreover, if (contrary to the Tribunal's decision), the effect could be retrospective, the Tribunal would have to decide whether, nevertheless, in the present case it was not so exercised, given the terms of the Respondent's letter dated 18 February 2003. In the circumstances, however, it is unnecessary to decide this further question.\n\n165.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent's exercise of its right under Article 17(1) ECT by its letter dated 18 February 2003 only deprived the Claimant of the advantages under Part III of the ECT prospectively from that date onwards. In the present case, it may well be that this particular decision will render moot, or substantially moot, any further need to consider other issues arising from the first and second limbs of Article 17(1) ECT. Nonetheless, as requested by the parties, the Tribunal has sought to address these issues here also.\n\n8. Burden and Standard of Proof\n-------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent bears the burden of showing that Article 17(1) applies factually to the present dispute to disqualify its claim on the merits. The Respondent contends that, although it might have borne the burden initially in asserting Article 17(1), the burden subsequently shifted to the Claimant to show that its ownership and control has never been held by a national of a third state, being an approach consistent with ECT Understanding No 3 (relating to Article 1(6) defining \"Investment\" where there is a \"doubt\" as to whether an Investor controls an Investment, directly or indirectly). Further, Respondent contended that the burden shifted to the Claimant when it alone could produce the relevant documentation and testimony required to resolve disputed factual issues over its own ownership and control.\n\n167.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as already indicated above, the burden of proof on the merits is significantly different from the burden applied to a jurisdictional issue. Further, the parties were not agreed on the standard of proof, including the drawing of adverse inferences; and the parties' submissions may disguise a further difference between the legal and evidential burdens of proof. Given these factors, the Tribunal has experienced difficulties in addressing factual issues disputed between the parties, particularly as regards Article 17(1)'s first limb. It is however convenient to begin with its second limb where no such difficulties arise.\n\n9. Article 17(1)'s Second Limb: \"No Substantial Business Activities\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nUnder Article 17(1)'s second limb, the factual question is whether the Claimant \" *has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized* \", i.e., Cyprus. In its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant asserted that it had \" *substantial business activities in Nicosia* \" (see paragraph 85). In its Rejoinder, the Claimant appeared to concede that it did not conduct substantial business activities in Cyprus. In an equivocal footnote number 49 (at page 24), the Claimant there stated that it was \" *prepared to accept, for present purposes, that it does not conduct substantial business activities in Cyprus. The same is not true of PHL...* \". At the hearing on 21 September 2004, that concession was confirmed by the Claimant's counsel without any qualification: \" *We do accept that the second limb of Article 17 is satisfied; we accept that PCL* [the Claimant] *has no substantial business activities in Cyprus, the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organised, for the purposes of the ECT...* \" [D2.8].\n\n169.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the concession was rightly, if belatedly, made by the Claimant. It is clear to the Tribunal that the Claimant itself has never had any substantial business activities in Cyprus; and contrary to the Claimant's pleading, this shortfall cannot be made good with business activities undertaken by an associated but different legal entity, Plama Holding Limited (\"PHL\"), even where PHL owns or controls the Claimant. In the Tribunal's view, the second limb of Article 17(1) is satisfied and applies to the present case.\n\n10. Article 17(1)'s First Limb: \"Own or Control\"\n------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nUnder Article 17(1)'s first limb, the question is whether the Claimant is a legal entity owned or controlled \"by citizens or nationals of a third state\". A \"third state\" being a non-Contracting State under the ECT, it would not include France (as a Contracting State); and if a national of France \"owned\" and \"controlled\" the Claimant at all material times, it would follow that Article 17(1)'s first limb would not be satisfied in the present case. In the Tribunal's view, the word \"or\" signifies that ownership and control are alternatives: in other words, only one need be met for the first limb to be satisfied, as the Claimant rightly conceded at the September Hearing [D2.37]. Also, in the Tribunal's view, ownership includes indirect and beneficial ownership; and control includes control in fact, including an ability to exercise substantial influence over the legal entity's management, operation and the selection of members of its board of directors or any other managing body. This interpretation appeared to be common ground between the parties: see the Respondent's Memorial at paragraphs 49 ff (page 17) and the Claimant's submissions at the September Hearing [D2.38]. What was not remotely common ground were the relevant facts.\n\n11. Mr. Vautrin\n---------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimant's present case relies on Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin as a French national controlling and owning the Claimant at all material times; and accordingly the factual question under this first limb can be reformulated more simply: does the evidence submitted support the Claimant's assertion that the Claimant's shares were and remain beneficially owned by PHL, incorporated in Cyprus; that PHL's shares were and remain beneficially owned by EMU Investments Limited (EMU), incorporated in the British Virgin Islands; that EMU's bearer shares were and remain beneficially owned by Mr. Vautrin; and that consequently the Claimant was a legal entity \"owned\" by Mr. Vautrin as a French national under Article 17(1) ECT and by virtue of such ownership, Mr. Vautrin \"controlled\" the Claimant? The answer to this question is not, however, simple from the materials currently available to the Tribunal.\n\n172.\n\nMr. Vautrin provided three written witness statements dated 25 March, 25 June and 26 August 2004; and he testified orally in French before the Tribunal on 20 September 2004, as recorded in English translation in the corrected transcript10. At the outset of his oral evidence to the Tribunal, Mr. Vautrin made the following declaration: (translation from the French) \" *I solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience that I shall speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth* \" (in accordance with Rule 35(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules); and he also confirmed the truth of his earlier witness statements [D1.5]. At the September Hearing, he was examined by the Claimant and cross-examined by the Respondent and answered questions from the Tribunal. [D1.5: examination by the Claimant; D1.39: cross-examination by the Respondent; and D1.82: examination by the Tribunal]. Subject to Article 21(a) of the ICSID Convention, Mr. Vautrin thereby took personal responsibility over his testimony.\n\nAs of the date of this Decision, the parties had not yet agreed on a transcript of either the original French or English translation of Mr. Vautrin's testimony, a fact which does not affect this Decision.\n\n173.\n\nMr. Vautrin testified that he was a French national and that he had never been the national of any other country [D1.6]. He testified that he was a businessman by profession and, a factor which may bear certain relevance in this case, not a lawyer [D1.6 and 49]. He testified that, in the summer of 1998, he decided to participate in his personal capacity in the purchase of Nova Plama [D1.22 and 83], that it was he who had then given instructions to his own lawyer, Mr. Nordtomme, to incorporate the Claimant and to act for the Claimant in the negotiations for Nova Plama's purchase [D1.23 and 25.]. He unequivocally testified that he was the Claimant's ultimate owner from 1998 onwards and that the Claimant was run according to his instructions also from 1998 onwards [D1.38-39].\n\n174.\n\nMr. Vautrin testified that whilst he had never sought to mislead the Bulgarian Government as to who owned or controlled the Claimant in the negotiations and purchase of Nova Plama's shares in 1998, he had also not told them that he did [D1.59]. He explained that subsequently he did not wish to disclose publicly his true role out of concern for his personal safety in Bulgaria; and that he only very belatedly agreed to disclose that role in connection with these arbitration proceedings because \" *it* *was explained to me that I had to do so; but I decided to do so as late in time as* *possible* \" [D1.67]. That time was the first session of these arbitration proceedings held in Paris on 25 March 2004, where counsel for the Claimant disclosed, in the presence of Mr. Vautrin (and in accordance with Mr. Vautrin's first witness statement made that same day), that Mr. Vautrin was the sole person ultimately owning and controlling the Claimant; and further that the reference in the plural to \"ultimate owners\" in paragraph 84 of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration was a mistake by the Claimant's previous legal representatives, which (as the record shows) included Mr. Nordtomme.\n\n175.\n\nAs regards the Dolsamex/O'Neill claim to ownership of PCL's shares, Mr. Vautrin unequivocally testified in his second witness statement: \"... *I confirm that neither* *Mr. O'Neill nor any entity owned or represented by him possess any ownership rights relating to PCL or any of the Plama group entities. No rights of any nature have been recognised to these persons by courts in Switzerland or elsewhere. Neither have these*  *persons at any time prior to this sought to exercise any type of management control over PCL or any of the companies in the project* \" (paragraph 53).\n\n176.\n\nAs regards the Pledge Agreement of 13 November 2002 whereby EMU shares were apparently pledged to a lending institution as pledgee by Allspice Trading Inc and Panorama Industrial Inc (both incorporated in the Seychelles), Mr. Vautrin unequivocally testified that no EMU bearer shares had in fact been transferred to these Seychelles companies for the purpose of this pledge (or at all); and in any event that he had owned and still owned the shares in these two Seychelles companies [D1.37]. Accordingly, the Claimant submitted that this Pledge Agreement did not evidence any break in Mr. Vautrin's continuous ownership and control of the Claimant.\n\n177.\n\nBulgaria complains that the Claimant's explanations of its ultimate ownership and control by Mr. Vautrin are belated, incomplete, unreliable, incredible and even where technically correct, less than the whole truth. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should reject Mr. Vautrin's testimony and decide that the Claimant has failed to establish that Mr. Vautrin owns and controls the Claimant within the meaning of the first limb to Article 17(1) ECT. For reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not here accept this submission; but it is appropriate to record that Mr. Vautrin's evidence as to his ultimate ownership and control of the Claimant is not only largely unsupported by contemporary documentation but that it is materially inconsistent with parts of that documentation and also contradicted by other statements apparently attributable to Mr. Vautrin, particularly in the several legal proceedings by Mr. O'Neill and Dolsamex and in the local and international press. It is also appropriate to record that the Tribunal did not hear relevant testimony at the September Hearing from other important witnesses from the Claimant, especially Mr. Nordtomme (although as he was tendered by the Claimant to the Respondent as a witness available for crossexamination).\n\n178.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fact remains that Mr. Vautrin testified under crossexamination before the Tribunal at the September Hearing; his own testimony remained unequivocal on the relevant issues; and on the existing materials, the Tribunal would not wish to reject his evidence as false at this stage of the proceedings. If this were a factual issue relevant only to jurisdiction, the Tribunal would therefore be minded to accept Mr. Vautrin's testimony at face value under Judge Higgins' approach, notwithstanding any doubts regarding Mr. Vautrin's continuous ownership of the Claimant from September 1998 to the present day. As the Tribunal has already decided, however, Article 17(1)'s first limb is not a jurisdictional issue; nor is it necessary to decide this issue on the merits for the non-application of Article 17(1) retrospectively from 18 February 2003. Moreover, the Tribunal is concerned that the factual issue of the Claimant's ownership may significantly overlap the \"misrepresentation\" case advanced by the Respondent on the merits, which cannot be decided by the Tribunal at this stage of these proceedings (as explained further below). There is a risk of the Tribunal prejudicing one or other party's position on these future issues; and for the time being, therefore, the less said here the better. If it later proves necessary for the Tribunal to decide on the merits whether Article 17(1)'s first limb was satisfied, it can always do so. For all these reasons, the Tribunal decides that it would be wrong here to decide whether or not Article 17(1)'s first limb was or was not satisfied; and the Tribunal does not do so. It reserves that decision for a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n12. Summary on the Energy Charter Treaty\n----------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nIt is convenient to summarize the Tribunal's several decisions on the ECT: (A) As to the *jurisdictional* issues: (1) Under Article 26 ECT and the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on the merits the Claimant's claims against the Respondent for alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT; (2) Article 17(1) ECT has no relevance to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to determine those claims; (3) Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the ECT and ICSID Convention; and (B) as to the *merits* of the Respondent's case under Article 17(1) ECT; (4) Article 17(1) requires the Contracting State to exercise its right of denial and such exercise operates with prospective effect only, as it did in this case from the date of the Respondent's exercise by letter of 18 February 2003; (5) the second limb of Article 17(1) regarding \"no substantial business activities\" is satisfied to the Tribunal's satisfaction; and (6) the Tribunal declines for the time being to decide the first limb of article 17(1) regarding the Claimant's \"ownership\" and \"control\".\n\n**B. The Respondent's Request that the Arbitral Proceedings Be Suspended**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent requests that, in the event the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction over this dispute, which it has now done, it suspend the arbitral proceedings until the Swiss courts finally decide in the Dolsamex litigation who the real owner of the shares of PCL is. The Respondent argues that should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction and decide this case and should Dolsamex then be found by the competent courts to be the owner of PCL's shares, the Respondent risks a second arbitration claim against it by the Claimant and its new owners. Should an award be issued in favor of the Claimant, the Respondent may pay any monies awarded to an entity with no legal entitlement to act for PCL.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that is a correct analysis of the situation. PCL, not the shareholders of PCL, is the party to this arbitration. As already noted in paragraph 135 *supra,* PCL has shown, in the record, that its filing for arbitration was authorized by its registered directors. It is not seriously contested that they had the authority under Cyprus law to do so. Any decision rendered by the Tribunal will be binding upon PCL as well as on Bulgaria and will be *res judicata* between the parties. If Dolsamex is found to be the owner of the shares of PCL, it may have a claim against the company or against Mr. Vautrin; but the Tribunal does not see how PCL, with new shareholders, could successfully make the same claims against the Respondent as in the present arbitration or reopen the Tribunal's decision.\n\n182.\n\nAs a consequence of the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's request that it suspend the arbitration proceedings.\n\n**C. Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal under The Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant contends that to the extent that Bulgaria's denial of Part III advantages of the ECT affects this Tribunal's jurisdiction, Bulgaria consented to ICSID arbitration of the present dispute in the 1987 Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT through the MFN provision contained therein. The mechanism for arriving at that conclusion is, according to the Claimant, the following: (a) the Claimant qualifies as an investor under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT; (b) the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT contains an MFN provision; (c) the MFN provision in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT applies to all aspects of \"treatment;\" and (d) \"treatment\" covers settlement of disputes provisions in other BITs to which Bulgaria is a Contracting Party. In that connection, the Claimant relies, *inter alia*, on the Bulgaria-Finland BIT. The Respondent contests the Claimant's contention on grounds that will be considered below.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the MFN provision of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT cannot be interpreted as providing consent to submit a dispute under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT to ICSID arbitration for the reasons set forth hereafter.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the Respondent does not seriously contest that the Claimant qualifies as an investor under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT. As a result, the question before the Tribunal is how the MFN provision in that BIT should be interpreted.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant's position appears to be prompted by the limited dispute settlement provisions in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT (quoted at paragraph 26 *supra*). Said provisions are concerned only with disputes relating to expropriation, the legality of which *\"shall be checked at the request of the concerned investor through the regular administrative and legal procedures of the Contracting Party that had taken the appropriate steps.\"* (Article 4.1). A dispute *\"with regard to the amount of compensation... shall be checked either in a legal regular procedure of the Contracting Party which has taken the measure on expropriation or by an* *international \u2018AdHoc' Arbitration Court\" (id.),* which is detailed in Articles 4.2 - 4.5 (basically, UNCITRAL arbitration, the \"Chairman of the Court of Arbitration to the Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm\" being the Appointing Authority). The Claimant does not invoke these dispute settlement provisions in the present case.\n\n187.\n\nThe MFN provision set forth in Article 3 of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT reads as follows:\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall apply to the investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment which is not less favourable than that accorded to investments by investors of third states.*\n\n*2. This treatment shall not be applied to the privileges which either Contracting Party accords to investors from third countries in virtue of their participation in economic communities and unions, a customs union or a free trade area.*\n\n188.\n\nWhilst the Claimant and the Respondent agree that this provision is to be interpreted pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention of 1969 (see text at paragraph 26, *supra*), they reach opposite conclusions.\n\n189.\n\nIt is not clear whether the ordinary meaning of the term \"treatment\" in the MFN provision of the BIT includes or excludes dispute settlement provisions contained in other BITs to which Bulgaria is a Contracting Party. Inclusion or exclusion may or may not satisfy the *ejusdem generis* principle (i.e., when a general word or phrase follows a list of specifics, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only items of the same type as those listed), but as it will be seen below, it is not relevant to address that question.\n\n190.\n\nIn this connection, the difference between the terms *\"treatment... accorded to investments,\"* as appearing in Article 3(1) of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, and \" *treatment... accorded to investors*,\" as appearing in other BITs, is to be noted. The Tribunal does not attach a particular significance to the use of the different terms, in particular not since Article 3(1) contains the words *\"investments by investors\"*11.\n\nSee also, *Siemens v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision of 3 August 2004, at paragraphs 91-92, http://www.asil.org/ilib/Siemens\\_Argentina.pdf.\n\n191.\n\nThe second paragraph of Article 3 of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT contains an exception to MFN treatment relating to economic communities and unions, a customs union or a free trade area. This may be considered as supporting the view that all other matters, including dispute settlement, fall under the MFN provision of the first paragraph of Article 3 (on the basis of the principle *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*). However, the fact that the second paragraph refers to \"privileges\" may be viewed as indicating that MFN treatment should be understood as relating to substantive protection. Hence, it can be argued with equal force that the second paragraph demonstrates that the first paragraph is solely concerned with provisions relating to substantive protection to the exclusion of the procedural provisions relating to dispute settlement.\n\n192.\n\nThe \"context\" may support the Claimant's interpretation since the MFN provision is set forth amongst the Treaty's provisions relating to substantive investment protection. However, the context alone, in light of the other elements of interpretation considered herein, does not persuade the Tribunal that the parties intended such an interpretation. And the Tribunal has no evidence before it of the negotiating history of the BIT to convince it otherwise.\n\n193.\n\nThe object and purpose of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT are: *\"the creation of favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"* (Preamble, see also title which refers to *\"mutual encouragement and protection of investments\"*). The Claimant places much reliance on the foregoing and on the Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention of 1965, according to which: *\"the creation of an institution designed to facilitate the settlement of disputes between States and foreign investors can be a major step toward promoting an atmosphere of mutual confidence and thus stimulating a larger flow of private international capital in those countries which wish to attract it\"* (Exhibit C60, at paragraph 9). The Claimant further relies on UNCTAD's study \"Bilateral Investment Treaties in the Mid-1990s\" which contains language to the same effect (Exhibit C104 at p. 5). The Claimant also points to the *Maffezini* decision in which it is observed: *\"dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors, as they are also related to* *the protection of rights of traders under treaties of commerce\"12*. Such statements are as such undeniable in their generality, but they are legally insufficient to conclude that the Contracting Parties to the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT intended to cover by the MFN provision agreements to arbitrate in other treaties to which Bulgaria (and Cyprus for that matter) is a Contracting Party. Here, the Tribunal is mindful of Sir Ian Sinclair's warning of the *\"risk that the placing of undue emphasis on the \u2018object and purpose' of a treaty will encourage teleological methods of interpretation [which], in some of its more extreme forms, will even deny the relevance of the intentions of the parties\"13*.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction of 25 January 2000, reprinted in 16 ICSID Rev.-F.I.L.J. 212 (2001), at paragraph 54.\n\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 2nd ed. 1984, at 130\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no guidance in the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, as there are no facts or circumstances that point to their application. The same goes for paragraph 4 of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention *(\"A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended\").*\n\n195.\n\nIt is true that treaties between one of the Contracting Parties and third States may be taken into account for the purpose of clarifying the meaning of a treaty's text at the time it was entered into. The Claimant has provided a very clear and insightful presentation of Bulgaria's practice in relation to the conclusion of investment treaties subsequent to the conclusion of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT in 1987. In the 1990s, after Bulgaria's communist regime changed, it began concluding BITs with much more liberal dispute resolution provisions, including resort to ICSID arbitration. However, that practice is not particularly relevant in the present case since subsequent negotiations between Bulgaria and Cyprus indicate that these Contracting Parties did not intend the MFN provision to have the meaning that otherwise might be inferred from Bulgaria's subsequent treaty practice. Bulgaria and Cyprus negotiated a revision of their BIT in 1998. The negotiations failed but specifically contemplated a revision of the dispute settlement provisions (see Witness Statement by Christo P. Tepavitcharov at paragraph 20 and Exhibit 5 thereto, containing an exchange of notes between Bulgaria and Cyprus). It can be inferred from these negotiations that the Contracting Parties to the BIT themselves did not consider that the MFN provision extends to dispute settlement provisions in other BITs.\n\n196.\n\nIt may be mentioned here (see also Article 32 of the Vienna Convention) that the parties to the present arbitration have not produced preparatory work of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT. They did provide some indication of the circumstances surrounding its conclusion. At that time, Bulgaria was under a communist regime that favored bilateral investment treaties with limited protections for foreign investors and with very limited dispute resolution provisions.\n\n197.\n\nThe previous two paragraphs indicate that, at the time of conclusion, Bulgaria and Cyprus limited specific investor-state dispute settlement to the provisions set forth in the BIT and had no intention of extending those provisions through the MFN provision.\n\n198.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the following consideration is equally, if not more, important. With the advent of bilateral and multilateral investment treaties since the 1980s (today estimated to be more than 1,500), the traditional diplomatic protection mechanism by home states for their nationals investing abroad has been largely replaced by direct access by investors to arbitration against host states. Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that phenomenon does not take away the basic prerequisite for arbitration: an agreement of the parties to arbitrate. It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an agreement should be clear and unambiguous. In the framework of a BIT, the agreement to arbitrate is arrived at by the consent to arbitration that a state gives in advance in respect of investment disputes falling under the BIT, and the acceptance thereof by an investor if the latter so desires.\n\n199.\n\nDoubts as to the parties' clear and unambiguous intention can arise if the agreement to arbitrate is to be reached by incorporation by reference. The Claimant argues that the MFN provision produces such effect, stating that in contractual relationships the incorporation by reference of an arbitration agreement is commonplace. In support thereof, the Claimant relies on Article 7(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of 1985. The Claimant adds that in treaty relationships the importation of the arbitration agreement through the MFN provision operates in exactly the same way.\n\n200.\n\nArticle 7(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law provides:\n\n*The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement provided that the contract is in writing and* *the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract* *.* (emphasis added)\n\nThus, a reference may in and of itself not be sufficient; the reference is required to be such as to make the arbitration clause part of the contract (i.e., in this case, the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT). This is another way of saying that the reference must be such that the parties' intention to import the arbitration provision of the other agreement is clear and unambiguous. A clause reading *\"a treatment which is not less favourable than that accorded to investments by investors of third states\"* as appears in Article 3(1) of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, cannot be said to be a typical incorporation by reference clause as appearing in ordinary contracts. It creates doubt whether the reference to the other document (in this case the other BITs concluded by Bulgaria) clearly and unambiguously includes a reference to the dispute settlement provisions contained in those BITs.\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the MFN provision in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT is a broad provision and is in contrast to other types of MFN provisions, such as Article 1103 NAFTA:\n\n*Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.*\n\n202.\n\nThe same provision can be found in Free Trade of the Americas (FTAA) draft of 21 November 2003. Footnote 13 to the draft FTAA reads:\n\n*Note: One delegation proposes the following footnote to be included in the negotiating history as a reflection of the Parties' shared understanding of the Most-Favored-Nation Article and the Maffezini case. This footnote would be deleted in the final text of the Agreement:*\n\n*The Parties note the recent decision of the arbitral tribunal in the Maffezini (Arg.) v. Kingdom of Spain, which found an unusually broad most favored nation clause in an Argentina-Spain agreement to encompass international dispute resolution procedures. See Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7\u00a7 38-64 (January 25, 2000), reprinted in 16 ICSID Rev.-F.I.L.J. 212 (2002). By contrast, the Most-Favored-Nation Article of this Agreement is expressly limited in its scope to matters \"with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\" The Parties share the understanding and intent that this clause does not encompass international dispute resolution mechanisms such as those contained in Section C.2.b (Dispute Settlement between a Party and an Investor of Another Party) of this Chapter, and therefore could not reasonably lead to a conclusion similar to that of the Maffezini case.*\n\n203.\n\nThis shows that in NAFTA and probably in the FTAA the incorporation by reference of the dispute settlement provisions set forth in other BITs is explicitly excluded. Yet, if such language is lacking in an MFN provision, one cannot reason *a contrario* that the dispute resolution provisions must be deemed to be incorporated. The specific exclusion in the draft FTAA is the result of a reaction by States to the expansive interpretation made in the *Maffezini* case. That interpretation went beyond what State Parties to BITs generally intended to achieve by an MFN provision in a bilateral or multilateral investment treaty. The Tribunal will examine the *Maffezini* decision in more detail below.\n\n204.\n\nRather, the intention to incorporate dispute settlement provisions must be clearly and unambiguously expressed. This is, for example, the case with the UK Model BIT, which provides in its Article 3(3):\n\n*For avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.*\n\nArticles 8 and 9 of the UK Model BIT provide for dispute settlement. The drafters of the UK Model BIT rightly noted that there could be doubt and expressly neutralized that doubt.\n\n205.\n\nThe expression *\"with respect to all matters\"* as appearing in MFN provisions in a number of other BITs (but not the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT) does not alleviate the doubt as pointed out in *Siemens v. The Argentine Republic**14*.\n\nSee footnote 11, *supra*\n\n206.\n\nDoubt may be further created by the scope of the dispute settlement provisions in the other BITs. A number of them refer to disputes arising out of the particular BIT15. It appears to be difficult to interpret the MFN clause as importing into the particular BIT such specific language from other BITs.\n\nSee, for example Article 10(1) of the Bulgaria-Morocco BIT and Article 9(1) of the Bulgaria-Tunisia BIT, referring to disputes relating to \"failure to perform obligations under this Agreement\" or obligations \"arising from this Agreement\". Article 8 of the Bulgaria-Finland BIT on which Claimant relies is not entirely clear in that respect.\n\n207.\n\nConversely, dispute resolution provisions in a specific treaty have been negotiated with a view to resolving disputes under that treaty. Contracting States cannot be presumed to have agreed that those provisions can be enlarged by incorporating dispute resolution provisions from other treaties negotiated in an entirely different context.\n\n208.\n\nMoreover, the doubt as to the relevance of the MFN clause in one BIT to the incorporation of dispute resolution provisions in other agreements is compounded by the difficulty of applying an objective test to the issue of what is more favorable. The Claimant argues that it is obviously more favorable for the investor to have a choice among different dispute resolution mechanisms, and to have the entire dispute resolved by arbitration as provided in the Bulgaria-Finland BIT, than to be confined to *ad hoc* arbitration limited to the quantum of compensation for expropriation. The Tribunal is inclined to agree with the Claimant that in this particular case, a choice is better than no choice. But what if one BIT provides for UNCITRAL arbitration and another provides for ICSID? Which is more favorable?\n\n209.\n\nIt is also not evident that when parties have agreed in a particular BIT on a specific dispute resolution mechanism, as is the case with the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT (*ad hoc* arbitration), their agreement to most-favored nation treatment means that they intended that, by operation of the MFN clause, their specific agreement on such a dispute settlement mechanism could be replaced by a totally different dispute resolution mechanism (ICSID arbitration). It is one thing to add to the treatment provided in one treaty more favorable treatment provided elsewhere. It is quite another thing to replace a procedure specifically negotiated by parties with an entirely different mechanism.\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimant has relied on a number of cases that it believes support its interpretation. It is to be noted, however, that in none of these cases was it held that the dispute settlement provisions in the basic treaty are replaced *in toto* by the dispute settlement provisions contained in the other treaty through operation of the MFN provision in the basic treaty. Indeed, the Respondent contended that no tribunal has ever done what the Claimant is requesting this Tribunal to do in the present case.\n\n211.\n\nThe decision in *Ceskoslovenska Obdchodni Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic**16* is not relevant. The case concerned a clause in a specific contract (\"Consolidation Agreement\") between the parties to those proceedings in which it was provided:\n\n*\"[T]his Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and the Treaty* *on the Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic dated November 23, 1992.\"* The tribunal in that case concluded that *\"by referring to the BIT, the parties intended to incorporate Article 8 of* *the BIT [i.e., dispute settlement provisions] by reference into the Consolidation* *Agreement, in order to provide for international arbitration as their chosen dispute settlement method\"* (Decision at paragraph 55). The tribunal reached that conclusion on the basis of the negotiating history between the parties to the Consolidation Agreement. That is a setting which is different from the incorporation of dispute settlement provisions through an MFN provision in a BIT between two states.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999, reprinted in 14 ICSID Rev.-F.I.L.J. 250 (1999).\n\n212.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the lack of precedent is not surprising. When concluding a multilateral or bilateral investment treaty with specific dispute resolution provisions, states cannot be expected to leave those provisions to future (partial) replacement by different dispute resolution provisions through the operation of an MFN provision, unless the States have explicitly agreed thereto (as in the case of BITs based on the UK Model BIT). This matter can also be viewed as forming part of the nowadays generally accepted principle of the separability (autonomy) of the arbitration clause. Dispute resolution provisions constitute an agreement on their own, usually with interrelated provisions.\n\n213.\n\nIn the *Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of America in Morocco**,17* the United States claimed *\"privileges with regard to consular jurisdiction\"* as appearing in treaties that Morocco had concluded with Spain and the United Kingdom, on the basis of the MFN provision in the treaty of 1936 between Morocco and the United States *(\"whatever indulgence, in trade or otherwise, shall be granted to any of the Christian Powers, the citizens of the United States shall be equally entitled to them\")*. The International Court of Justice rejected such reliance by the United States because Spain and the United Kingdom had terminated those provisions. The United States had argued that such treaty provisions were intended to be *\"incorporated permanently by reference\".* The International Court of Justice, however, examined the intent of the Contracting Parties and the \"general treaty pattern\" of the other treaties concluded by Morocco. Such a broader examination shows that, in the view of the International Court of Justice, an MFN provision does not operate as an automatic incorporation by reference.\n\n152 I.C.J. Rep. 176, Judgment of 27 August 1952.\n\n214.\n\nIn the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Case**18**,* the International Court of Justice specifically stated: *\"Without considering the meaning and the scope of the most-favoured-nation clause.\"* (at para. 109). The Court concluded that the MFN provisions in the Iran-United Kingdom treaties *\"had no relation whatsoever to jurisdictional matters\"* between those two States.\n\nUnited Kingdom v. Iran, 1952 I.C.J. 39, Judgment on preliminary objection of 22 July 1952.\n\n215.\n\nIn the *Ambatielos* Case *19* the International Court of Justice did not reach the issue, although as a matter of principle it may be that the Court accepted that an MFN provision can extend to jurisdictional matters. In the ensuing arbitration20, the parties differed on the question whether \"administration of justice\" was comprised by the term \"commerce and navigation\" appearing in the MFN provision in the Anglo-Greek Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1886. The Commission of Arbitration held that it did. However, that ruling relates to provisions concerning substantive protection in the sense of denial of justice in the domestic courts. It does not relate to the import of dispute resolution provisions of another treaty into the basic treaty.\n\nGreece v. United Kingdom, 1953 I.C.J. 10, Judgment on the Obligation to Arbitrate, 19 May 1953.\n\nAmbatielos Claim, Greece v. United Kingdom *,* XII U.N. R.I.A.A. 9, Award of 6 March 1956.\n\n216.\n\nIn *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*21, the question arose whether the requirement set forth in the dispute settlement provisions in the Argentina-Spain BIT of 1991 that *\"domestic courts [be given] the opportunity to deal with a dispute for a period of eighteen months before it may be submitted to arbitration\"* was inapplicable by reliance on the dispute settlement provisions in the Chile-Spain BIT (which does not impose such condition) through operation of the MFN provision in the Argentina-Spain BIT. The arbitral tribunal in that case answered the question in the affirmative.\n\nSee footnote 12, *supra.*\n\n217.\n\nIn *Maffezini* the tribunal relied on *Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of America in* *Morocco*, *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Case*, and *Ambatielos Claim*. However, the foregoing review of those decisions shows that they do not provide a conclusive answer to the question.\n\n218.\n\nThe tribunal in *Maffezini* also noted that in other treaties the MFN provision mentions *\"all rights contained in the present Agreement\"* or *\"all matters subject to this Agreement,\"* in which case, according to the tribunal, *\"it must be established whether* *the omission [in the Argentina-Spain BIT] was intended by the parties [i.e.,* *Contracting Parties] or can reasonably be inferred from the practice followed by the parties in their treatment of foreign investors and their own investors\"* (Decision, paragraph 53). The present Tribunal considers such a basis for analysis in principle to be inappropriate for the question whether dispute resolution provisions in the basic treaty can be replaced by dispute resolution provisions in another treaty. As explained above, an arbitration clause must be clear and unambiguous and the reference to an arbitration clause must be such as to make the clause part of the contract (treaty).\n\n219.\n\nThe tribunal in *Maffezini* further referred to *\"the fact that the application of the most* *favoured nation clause to dispute settlement arrangements in the context of investment* *treaties might result in the harmonization and enlargement of the scope of such arrangements\"* (Decision at paragraph 62). The present Tribunal fails to see how harmonization of dispute settlement provisions can be achieved by reliance on the MFN provision. Rather, the \"basket of treatment\" and \"self-adaptation of an MFN provision\" in relation to dispute settlement provisions (as alleged by the Claimant) has as effect that an investor has the option to pick and choose provisions from the various BITs. If that were true, a host state which has not specifically agreed thereto can be confronted with a large number of permutations of dispute settlement provisions from the various BITs which it has concluded. Such a chaotic situation - actually counterproductive to harmonization - cannot be the presumed intent of Contracting Parties.\n\n220.\n\nThe *Maffezini* tribunal was apparently aware of this risk when it added:\n\n*[T]here are some important limits that ought to be kept in mind. As a matter of principle, the beneficiary of the clause should not be able to override public policy considerations that the [C]ontracting [P]arties might have envisaged as fundamental conditions for their acceptance of the agreement in question, particularly if the beneficiary is a private investor, as will often be the case. The scope of the clause might thus be narrower than it appears at first sight. (id.)*\n\nThe examples given by the tribunal are: (1) exhaustion of local remedies condition; (2) fork in the road provision; (3) *\"if the agreement provides for a particular* *arbitration forum, such as ICSID, for example, this option cannot be changed by invoking the clause, in order to refer the dispute to a different system of arbitration\"* ; (4) *\"if the parties have agreed to a highly institutionalized system of arbitration that incorporates precise rules of procedure\"* (referring as example to NAFTA). (Decision at paragraph 63).\n\n221.\n\nThe present Tribunal was puzzled as to what the origin of these \"public policy considerations\" is. When asked by the Tribunal at the Hearing, counsel for the Claimant responded: \" *They just made it up*.\" [D2,134]. The present Tribunal does not wish to go that far in its appraisal of the *Maffezini* decision. Rather, it seems that the effect of the \"public policy considerations\" is that they take away much of the breadth of the preceding observations made by the tribunal in *Maffezini*.\n\n222.\n\nIn *Maffezini* the tribunal pointed out:\n\n*It is clear, in any event, that a distinction has to be made between the legitimate extension of rights and benefits by means of the operation of the clause, on the one hand, and disruptive treatyshopping that would play havoc with the policy objectives of underlying specific treaty provisions, on the other hand.* (*Id.*)\n\n223.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees with that observation, albeit that the principle with multiple exceptions as stated by the tribunal in the *Maffezini* case should instead be a different principle with one, single exception: an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.\n\n224.\n\nThe decision in *Maffezini* is perhaps understandable. The case concerned a curious requirement that during the first 18 months the dispute be tried in the local courts. The present Tribunal sympathizes with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is nonsensical from a practical point of view. However, such exceptional circumstances should not be treated as a statement of general principle guiding future tribunals in other cases where exceptional circumstances are not present.\n\n225.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal has not relied on it since the parties have not been in a position to include it in their pleadings, the Tribunal notes that the foregoing considerations are in line with the recent award in *Salini v. Jordan**22*.\n\nSee footnote 7, *supra*\n\n226.\n\nIn light of the foregoing review, the Tribunal need not examine the decisions in *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed v. United Mexican States*23 and *Siemens AG v. The Argentine Republic**24* as both decisions are partially based on the *Maffezini* decision. Actually, the *Siemens* decision illustrates the danger caused by the manner in which the *Maffezini* decision has approached the question: the principle is retained in the form of a \"string citation\" of principle and the exceptions are relegated to a brief examination, prone to falling soon into oblivion (Decision, at paragraphs 105, 109 and 120).\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award of 29 May 2003, reprinted in Spanish in 19 ICSID Rev.-F.I.L.J. 158 (2004).\n\nSee footnote 11, *supra*.\n\n227.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the MFN provision of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT cannot be interpreted as providing consent to submit a dispute under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT to ICSID arbitration and that the Claimant cannot rely on dispute settlement provisions in other BITs to which Bulgaria is a Contracting Party in the present case.\n\n**D. Misrepresentation**\n------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that PCL misled it into believing that the Plama Consortium consisted of Norwegian Oil Company and Andr\u00e9 & Cie, and never revealed to Bulgaria (1) that those two companies had decided not to be investors and (2) that Mr. Vautrin had become the owner of PCL. If it had known these facts, the Respondent affirms that it would not have approved the purchase of Nova Plama by PCL. Under Bulgarian law, and, in particular, Article 5(1) of the Bulgarian Privatization Act, the obtaining of Bulgaria's consent to the investment by such misrepresentation vitiates Bulgaria's consent so that there is no valid investment under the ECT and consequently no ICSID jurisdiction under that treaty.\n\n229.\n\nAs the Arbitral Tribunal has already stated, in paragraphs 126-130 of this Decision, the Respondent's allegation of misrepresentation by the Claimant does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction in this case. Nevertheless, these assertions by the Respondent are serious charges which, the Tribunal will have to examine on the merits.\n\n230.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent reserved the right, should the Tribunal sustain its jurisdiction, to raise an objection relating to whether the Claimant's investment was made in accordance with law, given the alleged misrepresentation. The Tribunal, consequently, joins the issue of misrepresentation to the consideration of the merits of the case.\n\n**E. Registration by ICSID of the Request for Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondent argues that ICSID, in registering the Claimant's Request for Arbitration, did so only with respect to the claims based on the ECT and not those based on the BIT. Consequently, says the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction only over the claims under the ECT. Given the Tribunal's decision with respect to the BIT in section IV.C. *supra*, this point has become moot. Nevertheless, the Tribunal makes the following comments.\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent's argument is based on a letter from the Acting Secretary General of ICSID dated 4 June 2003. That letter states:\n\n*... I have carefully studied the request for arbitration and all of the related correspondence and documents that we have received from the Republic of Bulgaria and from Plama Consortium Limited. I do not find with the required degree of certainty (\"beyond reasonable doubt\") that the request is unregistrable under the provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty.* *I must therefore register the request under those provisions. The formal notice of registration will shortly be sent to the parties.*\n\n233.\n\nOn 19 August 2003, the Acting Secretary General sent to the parties the Notice of Registration, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. In that Notice of Registration it is said:\n\n*... I hereby notify you that I have on August 19, 2003, which is also the date of the dispatch of this Notice, registered in the Arbitration Register the request for arbitration of Plama Consortium Limited of December 24, 2002, as supplemented by its letters to the Centre of February 25, March 10, April 7, May 20, June 12 and 13, 2003.*\n\n234.\n\nWhile ICSID's letter of 4 June 2003 could be read as limited in character, the official Notice of Registration cannot. It is plain on its face that ICSID registered the Claimant's Request for Arbitration without any limitation at all. That Notice of Registration is the official notice referred to in Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. It is then up to the Arbitral Tribunal, under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, to determine its own competence.\n\n**F. Costs**\n------------\n\n235.\n\nEach party has requested the Arbitral Tribunal to award it costs for the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. Each party submitted its costs in its post-hearing memorials and commented on the other party's cost submissions.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant says that the Respondent should bear the costs of the jurisdictional phase because it failed to cooperate with PCL which offered and provided assistance to satisfy the Respondent, when it first raised jurisdictional objections, that Mr. Vautrin owned and controlled PCL.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent requests costs principally on the basis that as a result of the complicated structure of the ownership of PCL and the Claimant's unwillingness to respond fully to the Respondent's requests for information regarding ownership and control of PCL, the Respondent was obliged to spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain such information as it could on its own.\n\n238.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is sympathetic to the Respondent's position. The Claimant had access to and/or control over all information relating to its ownership and control. It was obvious when PCL began this arbitration that questions would arise as to its ownership and control in light of the provisions of Article 17(1) ECT. The evidence of Mr. Vautrin's asserted ownership and control of PCL should have been submitted by the Claimant as part of its case. The fact that it did not and that the structure of ownership it described in its memorials is so obtuse has raised many questions in the minds of the Arbitrators which remain to be explored in the second phase of this arbitration.\n\n239.\n\nThis being said, for the time being, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided to defer a decision on costs to the second phase of the case when it will be in a position to make an overall judgment about the costs of the arbitration.\n\n**V. THE DECISION**\n-------------------\n\n240.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following decisions:\n\nA. As to the jurisdictional issues with respect to the ECT:\n\n(1) Under Article 26 ECT and the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on the merits the Claimant's claims against the Respondent for alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT.\n\n(2) Article 17(1) ECT has no relevance to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to determine the Claimant's claims against the Respondent under Part III of the ECT.\n\nB. As to the merits of the Respondent's case under Article 17(1) ECT:\n\n(1) Article 17(1) requires the Contracting State to exercise its right of denial and such exercise operates with prospective effect only, as it did in this case from the Respondent's exercise by letter of February 18, 2003.\n\n(2) The second limb of Article 17(1) regarding \"no substantial business activities\" is met to the Tribunal's satisfaction in favor of the Respondent; and\n\n(3) The Tribunal declines for the time being to decide the first limb of Article 17(1) regarding the Claimant's \"ownership\" and \"control\".\n\nC. The most favored nation provision of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, read with other BITs to which Bulgaria is a Contracting Party (in particular the Bulgaria-Finland BIT), cannot be interpreted as providing the Respondent's consent to submit the dispute with the Claimant under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT to ICSID arbitration or entitling the Claimant to rely in the present case on dispute settlement provisions contained in these other BITs.\n\nD. The Tribunal rejects the Respondent's application to suspend the proceedings pending the final outcome of the litigation concerning Dolsamex and Mr. O'Neill.\n\nE. The arbitration will now move to the second phase, that is, an examination of the parties' claims on the merits.\n\nF. A decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the arbitration on the merits."}, {"Title": "Order on Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2005-09-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Order on Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------\n\nClaimant's Request\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, Claimant filed a Request for Urgent Provisional Measures in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 seeking urgent recommendations of provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nClaimant seeks an order recommending urgent provisional measures in the following terms:\n\n*(1) that the Respondent immediately discontinue and/or cause to be discontinued all pending proceedings, and refrain from bringing or participating in any future proceedings before the Bulgarian Courts and Bulgarian authorities relating in any way to this arbitration including (i) the reopened insolvency proceedings against Plama; (ii) the execution actions commenced by the ASR and (iii) the execution of the CPC's decision dated February 10, 2005*\n\n*(2) that the Respondent takes no action of any kind that might aggravate or further extend the dispute submitted to the Tribunal*\n\n*(3) that the Tribunal grant any further relief that it deems appropriate to preserve PCL's rights*\n\n*(4) that Respondent pays the full costs of this application, including the fees and expenses of PCL's legal counsel.*\n\n3.\n\nClaimant explained in its Request that various proceedings had been commenced against Nova Plama in the Bulgarian Courts which form the subject matter of the Request.

In this regard, Claimant draws the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the debts claimed by Yorset and DZI Bank, as the alleged legal successors of First Private Bank, Mineralbank and Balkanbank, are disputed by Claimant and part of the subject matter of the dispute before this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n(b) Claimant refers the Tribunal to a Decree of the Pleven District Court of July 19, 2005 regarding the insolvency proceedings, declaring Nova Plama bankrupt, ordering its business activity to be suspended, ordering that an attachment of Nova Plama's property be decreed, terminating the power of the management bodies of Nova Plama, decreeing that the assets of Nova Plama be sold and distributed to its creditors and appointing temporary trustees in bankruptcy to oversee the bankruptcy procedure.\n\n(c) While the Pleven Court's Decree may be appealed to the High Court of Cassation in Bulgaria, the Decree is subject to immediate execution which, according to Claimant, will not be stayed by such an appeal.\n\n(d) Bulgaria's Agency for State Receivables (\"ASR\")1 has commenced execution actions against Nova Plama for the collection of Nova Plama's public (tax and assurance) debts and, according to Claimant, has seized twelve properties owned by it and sold four pieces of Nova Plama's real estate.\n\n(e) Allowing the ASR to recover Nova Plama's tax debts at this stage, argues Claimant, when the survival of Nova Plama is at stake would serve only to aggravate the existing dispute between Claimant and Respondent. Claimant says its right to nonaggravation of the dispute deserves protection by the Tribunal in the form of an order for provisional measures.\n\n(f) Bulgaria's Commission on Protection of Competition (\"CPC\") is seized of an application by various entities against Nova Plama for breaches of Bulgarian competition law by reason of alleged illegal state subsidies. Claimant states that the CPC has decided on February 10, 2005 that Nova Plama is the beneficiary of an illegal state subsidy and has ordered its reimbursement by Nova Plama. Claimant alleges that while it has appealed the CPC's decision to the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court, such appeal is not suspensive of the execution of that decision; and if the CPC's decision is executed, a large part of Nova Plama's core inventory will be sold off and Nova Plama will not be able to start up the Refinery in such an event.\n\n(g) Accordingly, Claimant requests the Arbitral Tribunal to recommend that Respondent discontinues or causes to be discontinued all pending proceedings and refrains from bringing or participating in any execution actions pertaining to the CPC's decision in the future.\n\nASR is described by Claimant as the public executive for the securing and execution of public receivables.\n\n4.\n\nThe relief sought by Claimant is based on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention which provides as follows:\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n5.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states that:\n\n*(1) At any time during the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n6.\n\nClaimant contends that it has a right to non-aggravation of the dispute pending before the Arbitral Tribunal and that the reopening of the insolvency proceedings in Bulgaria will, in fact, lead to aggravation of its dispute with Bulgaria.\n\n7.\n\nIt also contends that Respondent's conduct threatens its right to the exclusive nature of ICSID arbitration under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy \u2026*\n\n8.\n\nClaimant furthermore argues that its rights which are the object of the present arbitration include the right to fair and equitable treatment of its investment, the right to constant protection and security, non-impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the right for its investment not to be subject to measures of expropriation or measures having equivalent effect and the right to have an effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights under domestic law. In order to preserve these rights, says Claimant, its investment must not suffer irreparable harm pending the outcome of the arbitration. Claimant seeks the preservation of its right to continue with the operation of the Refinery and to maintain the remaining value of its investment in Nova Plama. It asserts that it will not be able to do this if Nova Plama is liquidated and its inventory is converted to cash pursuant to the Pleven District Court's Decree of July 19, 2005.\n\nRespondent's Opposition\n-----------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn August 19, 2005, Respondent filed its Opposition to Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent argues that the relief sought by Claimant is unnecessary to preserve any of its rights in this arbitration because Claimant has failed to demonstrate that its rights in this arbitration would be irreparably harmed without the measures it seeks. According to Respondent:\n\n- None of the proceedings in Bulgaria interfere with Claimant's right under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention to the resolution of its Energy Charter Treaty claims in ICSID arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. None of the proceedings at issue threaten to rule on any of the Claimant's rights or Bulgaria's obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty. Those determinations remain exclusively for this Tribunal to make.\n\n- None of the actions in Bulgaria threaten Claimant's right to obtain an effective award on the basis of the claims it has presented. Claimant seeks an award of monetary compensation for what it alleges are breaches by Bulgaria of Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty. None of the Bulgarian proceedings threaten to undermine Claimant's ability to obtain an award fully compensating it should it demonstrate that any of its claims have merit. (In fact, Claimant asserted as of its Request for Arbitration that its investment already had in effect been expropriated entitling it to an award of \"the discounted cash flow of the company \u2026 in lieu of the market value if this gives a higher value.\") Claimant does not indicate that it is seeking an award on any other basis, nor has it demonstrated that it would be entitled to do so in this case.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent points out that Claimant's request, if granted, would affect proceedings in Bulgaria involving the rights of third parties entirely unrelated to this arbitration and would impact public interest rights generally (such as enforcement of competition law) as well as private commercial rights of individual parties not parties to the arbitration, where doing so would conflict with other international obligations of Bulgaria.\n\n12.\n\nRespondent outlines the legal standards which it says are applicable to Claimant's request:\n\n(a) an ICSID tribunal's authority to recommend provisional measures is limited to that which is necessary to preserve the right of a party.\n\n(b) The Tribunal can order a provisional measure to safeguard only those rights over which it is seized.\n\n(c) A requesting party must demonstrate *prima facie* that it has the specified right.\n\n(d) Article 26 of the ICSID Convention extends to the legal dispute to which the parties agreed to submit to ICSID arbitration, in this case to claims of breaches of the ECT.\n\n(e) The right to no aggravation of the dispute refers to preserving the efficacy of a final award on the basis of the claims presented.\n\n(f) Provisional measures are indicated to protect the substantive rights in dispute, not to enforce them.\n\n(g) A provisional measure must be necessary for the protection of the right in dispute.\n\n(h) Where any potential harm to a right is compensable, provisional measures are not indicated.\n\n13.\n\nRespondent elaborates its argument that as regards the bankruptcy proceedings pending in Bulgaria, these have been commenced by private, third-party creditors who have no relation to Bulgaria or to the dispute before this Tribunal. It goes on to rebut other allegations of Claimant regarding the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nWith respect to the Agency for State Receivables' actions to secure payment from Nova Plama for overdue taxes and other debts to the State, Respondent argues that these actions do not amount to harassment, do not affect Nova Plama's core assets and have been conducted in accordance with due process. It cites *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 of October 16, 2002:\n\n*We cannot enjoin a State from conducting the normal processes of criminal, administrative and civil justice within its own territory. We cannot, therefore, purport to restrain the ordinary exercise of these processes.*\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that the respondent to the application in that case was both the plaintiff in the Pakistani legal proceedings and SGS' co-contractor; there was no third party involved in the dispute before the ICSID tribunal, directly or indirectly.\n\n15.\n\nRegarding the proceedings commenced before the Bulgarian Commission for the Protection of Competition, Respondent points out that these proceedings were brought by third-parties, competitors of Nova Plama, against the State of Bulgaria for alleged, unlawful state aid to Nova Plama. The issues in that proceeding have nothing to do with the issues in the present arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nRespondent contends that none of the Bulgarian proceedings at issue affect any of Claimant's rights in the arbitration. It is not enough, says Respondent, for Claimant to observe that facts relevant to its claim are being addressed in the other proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nRespondent argues that none of the Bulgarian proceedings threaten irreparable harm to Claimant's substantive right to obtain an award on the basis of the ECT. It points out that what Claimant seeks in this arbitration is monetary compensation for losses it claims it suffered due to actions and omissions it claims are attributable to Bulgaria and breaches of Articles 10, 12 and 13 of the ECT.\n\nClaimant's Response\n-------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn August 25, 2005, Claimant submitted its Response to Respondent's Opposition to Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures.\n\n19.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's opposition on the grounds that suspending the Bulgarian bankruptcy proceedings is unprecedented is wrong, citing *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4). Claimant also argues that Bulgaria's contention that third party rights will be affected is irrelevant since Claimant's request is only for provisional measures to maintain the *status quo* of Nova Plama pending the final outcome of this arbitration, which would not prejudice such third party rights.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant says that Respondent's argument that the Arbitral Tribunal can only order provisional measures to safeguard rights over which it is seized is unsupported by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n21.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's contention that the Request seeks the enforcement, as opposed to the protection, of its rights under the ECT.\n\n22.\n\nClaimant says that if the reopened bankruptcy proceedings in Bulgaria are allowed to continue, its rights in this arbitration would be irreparably harmed, and damages would not be an adequate remedy. No monetary award, it argues, could compensate for the destruction of the Nova Plama refinery and its core inventory. Claimant adds that if insolvency proceedings continue, its right to the non-aggravation of the dispute, its right to the exclusive remedy under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and its rights in dispute in this arbitration will be irreparably prejudiced.\n\n23.\n\nClaimant, further, seeks to refute various factual allegations made by Respondent in its Opposition regarding the Bulgarian proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nFinally, Claimant reiterates its request for relief in terms identical to those in its initial Request.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder\n----------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn August 31, 2005, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder to Claimant's Reply.\n\n26.\n\nIn that Rejoinder, Respondent argues that Claimant's right under Article 26 of the ECT to ICSID arbitration as the exclusive remedy for the dispute is not infringed by the proceedings in Bulgaria. Respondent furthermore says that continuation of the Bulgarian proceedings will not aggravate the parties' dispute, i.e., will not undermine the resolution of the dispute by arbitration. Moreover, Claimant's rights in dispute which may be preserved by provisional measures pending a decision by the Tribunal do not include, says Respondent, the right to avoid commercial loss, particularly loss resulting from the payment of debts to third party creditors having no relation to the Parties in this arbitration or to the arbitration itself.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent contends that while, on the merits, Claimant seeks monetary compensation for what it claims are breaches by Bulgaria of various ECT obligations, it seeks as an interim measure an order directing Bulgaria to suspend ordinary judicial and administrative mechanisms affecting many third parties and the public interest.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent says that to be entitled to urgent provisional measures, Claimant must demonstrate that its rights at issue in the arbitration face irreparable harm due to acts of Respondent. There can be no irreparable harm, it asserts, when a threatened injury can be made whole by monetary compensation.\n\n29.\n\nRespondent says there is no precedent for an ICSID tribunal recommending the suspension of domestic legal proceedings where the proceedings involved and affected the rights of third parties unrelated both *de jure* and *de facto* to the parties and the arbitration. The right to maintain the *status quo*, invoked by Claimant, applies only as between the parties to a dispute.\n\n30.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder then goes on to examine the various proceedings underway in Bulgaria involving Nova Plama and to rebut Claimant's arguments about their effect on that company and on this arbitration.\n\nTelephone Conference\n--------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties' counsel on September 1, 2005 in which the Tribunal indicated that it did not consider an oral hearing other than that telephone conference to be necessary since the Parties' written submissions were very detailed and comprehensive. The Parties declared that they wished to make no further submissions beyond their respective written submissions prior to the telephone conference (which are summarised above). Various questions were put to counsel by the Tribunal and a discussion ensued of the procedure and timetable for rendering the Tribunal's decision on Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures. The conference was recorded by ICSID.\n\nExamination of the Parties' Contentions\n---------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration contains both principal claims based on the ECT and subsidiary claims based on relevant BITs. With respect to the latter claims, the Arbitral Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction dated February 8, 2005, held that:\n\n*The most favored nation provision of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, read with other BITs to which Bulgaria is a Contracting Party (in particular the Bulgaria-Finland BIT), cannot be interpreted as providing the Respondent's consent to submit the dispute with the Claimant under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT to ICSID arbitration or entitling the Claimant to rely in the present case on dispute settlement provisions contained in these other BITs.*\n\n33.\n\nThe first principal cause of action stated in Claimant's Request for Arbitration is that Respondent has breached Article 10 of the ECT. Claimant asserts that Respondent has violated its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Claimant's investment in Nova Plama under ECT Articles 10(1) and 10(12) which read as follows:\n\n*(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(12) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its domestic law provides effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights with respect to Investments, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.*\n\n34.\n\nThe second principal cause of action is based on the alleged breach by Respondent vis-\u00e0-vis Claimant's investment in Nova Plama of ECT Article 13 which provides that:\n\n*(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subject to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is*\n\n*(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;*\n\n*(b) not discriminatory*\n\n*(c) carried out under due process of law; and*\n\n*(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n35.\n\nClaimant's third principal cause of action relies on Article 12(1) of the ECT. That article stipulates:\n\n*(1) Except where Article 13 applies, an Investor of any Contracting Party which suffers a loss with respect to any Investment in the Area of another Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, state of national emergency, civil disturbance, or other similar event in that Area, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, treatment which is the most favourable of that which that Contracting Party accords to any other Investor, whether its own Investor, the Investor of any other Contracting Party, or the Investor of any third state.*\n\n36.\n\nIn Section 5 of its Request for Arbitration, Claimant sets forth its claims and request for relief. Its principal claims include damages for breaches of ECT Articles 10 and 12 as well as compensation in respect of expropriation as provided in ECT Article 13, plus compounded interest as well as indemnification of all costs incurred in relation to this arbitration. As confirmed by Claimant in the telephone conference on September 1, 2005, Claimant seeks only damages in the present arbitration.\n\n37.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will now examine Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures in the light of the issues in this case.\n\n38.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal's authority to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is not questioned. Nor, with one exception to which we will come, do the parties seriously differ over the legal considerations applicable to a decision whether or not to recommend such measures. The parties cite the same ICSID tribunal and ICJ court decisions and the same commentaries as evidence of the rules which have developed. Provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly. The need for provisional measures must be urgent and necessary to preserve the status quo or avoid the occurrence of irreparable harm or damage. Provisional measures are appropriate to preserve the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration to the exclusion of local administrative or judicial remedies as prescribed in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. They are also appropriate to prevent parties from taking measures capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual award or which might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult. Provisional measures must relate to the preservation of the requesting party's rights, as specified in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n39.\n\nIt is this latter element on which there is a difference between the parties. In the *Amco Asia v. Indonesia case* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 (Decision of December 9, 1983, reprinted in ICSID REP 410 at 411 (1993))), the arbitral tribunal said the rights to which Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules relate are the \"*rights in dispute* \". Claimant, in its Reply, takes issue with this statement and cites learned authors to the effect that the rights to be preserved should not be limited in this way.\n\n40.\n\nIt seems to the Arbitral Tribunal that the rights referred to in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules must be limited in some way. In the context of the present arbitration, the terms cannot mean any and all rights a party may have unconnected with the ECT or vis-\u00e0-vis third parties. If the words used in *Amco Asia*, \"rights in dispute\", may be too narrow, at least a limitation such as \"rights relating to the dispute\" is reasonable and necessary. The rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party's ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be carried out. Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party's claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those general rights must be related to the specific disputes in arbitration, which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant's claims and requests for relief to date.\n\n41.\n\nThe rights relating to the dispute in the present arbitration are the rights deriving from the Energy Charter Treaty: Claimant's rights to fair, equitable and non-discriminatory treatment for its investment. Claimant considers that Respondent has not accorded such treatment to its investment in Nova Plama, in violation of Respondent's obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty. Claimant invokes many grounds to support its claims - - some of which may be involved in the Bulgarian proceedings complained of - - but Claimant does not in this arbitration seek a Tribunal decision to remedy the alleged wrongs which make up these grounds other than by way of damages. Thus, the Tribunal is asked to decide whether Claimant is entitled to damages for the breach of the ECT which it alleges these wrongs constitute. Because the claims and relief which the Claimant seeks are limited to damages, the scope of the \"rights relating to this dispute\" which deserve protection by provisional measures is necessarily limited to the damage claims.\n\n42.\n\nNor are the causes of action and claims and requests for relief which are the subject matter of the present arbitration causes of action or claims and requests for relief in any of the proceedings in Bulgaria. The Arbitral Tribunal is unable to see how any of the proceedings underway in Bulgaria could affect the issues involved in this arbitration or the outcome of this arbitration. Even assuming the worst case from Claimant's point of view, i.e., that Nova Plama is liquidated and its assets distributed to creditors and that ASR and CPC are successful in their actions, Claimant in this arbitration - - which is not Nova Plama - - will still be able to pursue its ECT claims for damages against Bulgaria. And the outcome of the proceedings in Bulgaria will have no foreseeable effect on the Arbitral Tribunal's ability to make a determination of the issues in the arbitration.\n\n43.\n\nMoreover, at least with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings, it is significant that the parties to those proceedings and the parties to this arbitration are different. The bankruptcy proceedings are brought by private parties who are not involved in the present arbitration. The Tribunal is reluctant to recommend to a State that it order its courts to deny third parties the right to pursue their judicial remedies and is not satisfied that if it did so in this case, Respondent would have the power to impose its will on an independent judiciary. While under general principles of public international law, a state is responsible for actions of its courts, Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures is not based on a claim of denial of justice by those courts for which relief is sought. In addition, in the *CSOB v. Slovak* case (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4) where the arbitral tribunal did recommend the suspension of bankruptcy proceedings (see Procedural Order No. 4 of January 11, 1999 and Procedural Order No. 5 of March 1, 2000)2, it did so because and to the extent that the court in those proceedings might determine claims of a right to receive funds which were at issue in the arbitration. Moreover there was a direct link between the Slovak Republic as the respondent to CSOB's application for interim measures and the Slovak Collection Agency (Slovenska inkasni spol or 'SI') as the subject of the Slovak bankruptcy proceedings where CSOB was the only named creditor. Indeed, the absence of any other interested parties to the bankruptcy proceedings led the Slovak Court eventually to dismiss SI's bankruptcy for lack of plurality of creditors, as was explained by Counsel during the oral hearing by telephone on September 1, 2005: see also paragraphs 43 to 46 of the CSOB award of December 14, 2004. There is no similar situation in the present arbitration.\n\nIt is to be noted that during the telephone conference on September 1, 2005, counsel for Respondent explained that, in the *CSOB v. Slovak* case, the Slovak Republic did nothing to bring the tribunal's recommendation to the local court's attention. However, claimant did do so, but those courts did not accept the tribunal's recommendation.\n\n44.\n\nThe ASR and CPC proceedings may be different because ASR is an agency of the Bulgarian Government and CPC is an administrative tribunal. The Government could, undoubtedly, order ASR to discontinue the proceedings against Nova Plama if the Tribunal recommended it to do so. Quaere regarding CPC, which appears to be an administrative tribunal. However, the tax claims of the ASR and the state aid claims of CPC relating to Nova Plama, which are the subject of the proceedings in Bulgaria, are not presently claims before this Tribunal and will not affect Claimant's pursuit of its claims here or of the Tribunal's ability to dispose of them.\n\n45.\n\nThe proceedings underway in Bulgaria may well, in a general sense, aggravate the dispute between the parties. However, the Tribunal considers that the right to nonaggravation of the dispute refers to actions which would make resolution of the dispute by the Tribunal more difficult. It is a right to maintenance of the *status quo*, when a change of circumstances threatens the ability of the Arbitral Tribunal to grant the relief which a party seeks and the capability of giving effect to the relief.\n\n46.\n\nEven the urgency of the need for provisional measures and the \"irreparable\" nature of the harm invoked to justify such measures appear to the Tribunal unfounded. What Claimant is seeking in this arbitration are monetary damages for breaches of Respondent's obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty. Whatever the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings or the ASR or CPC proceedings in Bulgaria is, Claimant's right to pursue its claims for damages in this arbitration and the Arbitral Tribunal's ability to decide these claims will not be affected. The Tribunal accepts Respondent's argument that harm is not irreparable if it can be compensated for by damages, which is the case in the present arbitration and which, moreover, is the only remedy Claimant seeks.\n\n47.\n\nIt is undoubtedly true, as Claimant says, that if Nova Plama is placed in bankruptcy and sold to another investor or liquidated and its assets distributed to its creditors, Claimant will no longer have a going concern to operate. The same may be true if the ASR or CPC proceedings against Nova Plama are successful. But that is not an issue in the ICSID arbitration. Claimant has not sought restitution or any other relief from this Tribunal which would permit it to continue to operate the Nova Plama refinery. What is at issue here is Claimant's right to monetary damages because of Respondent's alleged breach of Treaty obligations.\n\nCosts\n-----\n\n48.\n\nLastly, the Arbitral Tribunal makes no order here regarding the costs of and arising from the Claimant's application, save to reserve its power to do so in a later order, decision or award.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal requests the Parties, in their eventual submissions on costs, to specify the costs incurred relating to this phase of the arbitration insofar as possible.\n\nThe Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal\n-------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal rejects Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures in its entirety.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal reserves its decision on the costs of the procedure relating to the Request for Urgent Provisional Measures to a later stage of this arbitration."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2008-08-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present arbitration arises under the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\" or the \"Treaty\"), a multilateral convention whose purpose, according to Article 2 thereof, is to establish a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy sector. In Article 10 of Part III of the ECT, Contracting States undertake the obligation to encourage and create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for Investments of Investors (as those terms are defined in the ECT \u2014 see Annex) of other Contracting States.\n\n2.\n\nThe conditions include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting States \"fair and equitable treatment,\" \"the most constant protection and security\" and treatment no less favorable than that required by international law. The Contracting Parties further undertake not to impair in any way by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of Investments and to observe any obligations they have entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of another Contracting State. Article 13 prohibits expropriation \"or measures having effect equivalent to [...] expropriation,\" except in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions. By Article 17 of the ECT, which is also found in Part III, Contracting States reserve the right to deny the advantages of Part III to a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third State own or control that entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.1 Part V of the ECT provides for dispute resolution, and its Article 26 permits, *inter alia,* Investors to resort to arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention concerning alleged breaches by a Contracting State of an obligation under Part III.\n\nBulgaria denied the protections of the ECT to Claimant, prospectively, from 18 February 2003. See paragraph 21 below and the discussion in the Decision on Jurisdiction, pp. 50 *et seq.*\n\n3.\n\nBecause they are referred to in the Parties\u2019 submissions and in this Award, the texts of the relevant provisions of the ECT are set forth in the Annex to this Award.\n\n**II. Procedure**\n-----------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 6 January 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a request for arbitration dated 24 December 2002 (\"Request for Arbitration\") from Plama Consortium Limited (\"PCL\" or \"Claimant\"), a Cypriot company, with its address at 4 Tenarou Street, Ayios Dometios, Nicosia, Cyprus, against the Republic of Bulgaria (\"Bulgaria\" or \"Respondent\"). The two parties together are referred to as \"the Parties.\" The Request for Arbitration invoked the ICSID arbitration provisions of the ECT and the most favored nation (\"MFN\") provision of a bilateral investment treaty (\"BIT\") concluded in 1987 between the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bulgaria (\"the BIT\"), which allegedly imported into the BIT the ICSID arbitration provisions of other BITs concluded by Bulgaria, in particular the Bulgaria - Finland BIT.\n\n5.\n\nThe Centre, on 14 January 2003, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt of the Request for Arbitration and, on the same day, transmitted a copy to Bulgaria and to the Bulgarian Embassy in Washington, D.C., USA.\n\n6.\n\nThere ensued exchanges of correspondence between the Parties and the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID concerning the jurisdiction of ICSID over the Request for Arbitration and its registerability under Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\") and ICSID Institution Rules 6 and 7.\n\n7.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, Claimant filed a Supplement to Request for Arbitration dated 6 April 2003. The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Supplement to Request for Arbitration on 17 April 2003 and, on the same day, transmitted a copy to Bulgaria and to the Bulgarian Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n8.\n\nUpon requests from both Parties, the Centre deferred registration. A further postponement of registration was sought by Respondent on 12 August 2003 but was opposed by Claimant.\n\n9.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration, as supplemented, was registered by the Centre on 19 August 2003, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and, on the same day, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, notified the Parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of 12 June 2003, Emmanuel Gaillard and John Savage of the law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP2 informed the Centre that they had been retained to represent Claimant, replacing Christian Nordtomme in these proceedings. Claimant further advised that it was also represented by Ciril Pelovski of the law firm Denev & Oysolov. On 20 August 2003, Respondent informed the Centre that it had retained as Counsel in the proceedings Paul D. Friedland, Carolyn B. Lamm and Abby Cohen Smutny of the law firm White & Case LLP. By a letter of 25 March 2004, Respondent further indicated having retained Lazar Tomov of the law firm Tomov & Tomov.\n\nSubsequently, Shearman & Sterling was succeeded as Counsel to Claimant by Virginie Colaiuta and, thereafter, by the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP, *see infra,* paragraphs 38 and 45.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the registration of the Request for Arbitration by the Centre, the Parties agreed on a three-member arbitral tribunal (the \"Arbitral Tribunal\" or the \"Tribunal\"). The Parties agreed that each of them would appoint an arbitrator and that the third arbitrator, who would be the President of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the Parties. The Parties agreed that the Centre would appoint the President of the Arbitral Tribunal should they fail to agree on the presiding arbitrator.\n\n12.\n\n[Missing page]\n\n13.\n\n[Missing page]\n\n14.\n\n[Missing page]\n\n15.\n\n[Missing page]\n\n**C. Written and Oral Procedures**\n----------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nAt that first session of the Arbitral Tribunal held in Paris on 25 March 2004, the Parties reiterated their agreement on the points communicated to the Tribunal in their joint letter of 19 March 2004, and the remainder of the procedural issues on the agenda for the session were discussed and agreed. All the conclusions were reflected in the written minutes of the session, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal and provided to the Parties, as well as all members of the Tribunal. It was agreed that Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction would be treated as a preliminary question. A schedule for the filing of memorials and for the holding of a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris on 20 and 21 September 2004 was agreed.\n\n17.\n\nPursuant to the agreed schedule, Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction on 26 May 2004. In support of its Memorial, Respondent submitted written statements of MM. Rudolph Dolzer, Charles Kerins, Sean McWeeney, Elias A. Neocleous, Timothy O\u2019Neill, Christo Tepavitcharov and Thomas W. W\u00e4lde, accompanied by a further copy of Mr. Jean Christophe Vautrin\u2019s first declaration.4 Claimant submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 25 June 2004, supported by Mr. Jean Christophe Vautrin\u2019s second declaration and a declaration from Mr. Jacques Python. This was followed, on 26 July 2004, by a Reply on Jurisdiction from Respondent, accompanied by statements from MM. Stanislav Ananiev, Alexander D. Boshkov, Elias A. Neocleous, Plamen Oresharski, Todor Marinov Palazov, Tencho Ivanov Tenev, Nikolay Vassilev and Milen Veltchev. Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, dated 26 August 2004, supported by Mr. Jean Christophe Vautrin\u2019s third declaration, was received by the Centre on 30 August 2004.\n\nMr. Vautrin\u2019s first declaration had been submitted earlier by Claimant\u2019s Counsel at the Tribunal\u2019s first session of 25 March 2004\n\n18.\n\nOn 26 July 2004, Respondent submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal a request for the production of documents by Claimant. By letter dated 6 August 2004, Claimant opposed that request. After considering the views of the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal, on 11 August 2004, issued Procedural Order No. 1 directing Claimant to produce all documents falling within the categories listed in the Order, no later than with the filing of its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. Claimant filed certain documents with its Rejoinder of 26 August 2004. Further to a request for extension made on 17 August 2004, which was accepted by Respondent, Claimant submitted to Respondent, under cover of a letter dated 6 September 2004, other documents pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Order. Claimant produced an additional set of documents by letter dated 13 September 2004.\n\n19.\n\nAn oral hearing on the preliminary question of jurisdiction was held in Paris on 20 and 21 September 2004. Counsel for both Parties addressed the Tribunal. One witness, Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin, testified orally for Claimant.\n\n20.\n\nOn 22 October 2004, Respondent filed a Post-Hearing Submission on Jurisdiction, to which Claimant responded by its Post-Hearing Response on Jurisdiction of 19 November 2004. On 3 December 2004, Respondent filed a Post-Hearing Reply on Jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 February 2005, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction. In the operative part, it ruled as follows:\n\n*A. As to the jurisdictional issues with respect to the ECT:*\n\n*(1) Under Article 26 ECT and the ICSID Convention, the* *Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on the merits the* *Claimant\u2019s claims against the Respondent for alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT.*\n\n*(2) Article 17(1) ECT has no relevance to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to determine the Claimant\u2019s claims against the Respondent under Part III of the ECT.*\n\n*B. As to the merits of the Respondent \u2019s case under Article 17(1) ECT:*\n\n*(1) Article 17(1) requires the Contracting State to exercise its right of denial and such exercise operates with prospective effect only, as it did in this case from the Respondent \u2019s exercise by letter of 18 February 2003.*\n\n*(2) The second limb of Article 17(1) regarding \"no substantial business activities\" is met to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction in favor of the Respondent; and*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal declines for the time being to decide the first* *limb of Article 17(1) regarding the Claimant\u2019s \"ownership\" and \"control.*\n\n*C. The most favored nation provision of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT, read with other BITs to which Bulgaria is a Contracting Party (in particular the Bulgaria-Finland BIT), cannot be interpreted as providing the Respondent\u2019s consent to submit the dispute with the Claimant under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT to ICSID arbitration or entitling the Claimant to rely in the present case on dispute settlement provisions contained in these other BITs.*\n\n*D. The Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s application to suspend the proceedings pending the final outcome of the litigation concerning Dolsamex and Mr. O \u2019Neill.*\n\n*E The arbitration will now move to the second phase, that is, an examination of the parties\u2019 claims on the merits.*\n\n*F. A decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the arbitration on the merits.*\n\nThis decision is incorporated by reference into the present award (collectively the \"Award\").\n\n22.\n\nThe Parties then agreed on a procedural timetable for the merits phase, which was reflected in Procedural Order No. 2 dated 31 March 2005. On the same date, the Centre sent to the Parties new certified copies of the Decision on Jurisdiction correcting a clerical error at paragraph 55 of the Decision.\n\n23.\n\nOn 29 July 2005, Claimant filed a Request for Urgent Provisional Measures in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, seeking urgent recommendations of provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. Claimant sought an order recommending that, *inter alia,* (1) Respondent immediately discontinue and/or cause to be discontinued all pending proceedings and refrain from bringing or participating in any future proceedings before the Bulgarian courts and Bulgarian authorities relating in any way to this ICSID arbitration; and (2) Respondent take no action that might aggravate or further extend the dispute.\n\n24.\n\nOn 19 August 2005, Respondent filed its Opposition to Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures, contending that the relief sought by Claimant was unnecessary because Claimant had failed to demonstrate that its rights in this ICSID arbitration would be irreparably harmed without the measures it sought.\n\n25.\n\nThis was followed by Claimant\u2019s Response to Respondent\u2019s Opposition to Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures dated 25 August 2005, and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder to Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures dated 31 August 2005. A procedural meeting by telephone conference with the Parties\u2019 Counsel followed on 1 September 2005, during which the Arbitral Tribunal put various questions to Counsel and discussed the procedure and timetable for rendering the order on provisional measures.\n\n26.\n\nOn 6 September 2005, the Arbitral Tribunal issued an Order rejecting Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures in its entirety and reserving its decision on the costs resulting from the foregoing procedure to a later stage of the arbitration.\n\n27.\n\nFollowing Claimant\u2019s request of 30 September 2005, the Arbitral Tribunal granted to Claimant a four-week extension of time to submit its Memorial on the Merits and issued, on 6 October 2005, Procedural Order No. 3, which modified the procedural calendar set forth in Procedural Order No. 2 for the filing of submissions on the merits.\n\n28.\n\nAccordingly, Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on 28 October 2005, supported by the fourth written declaration of Mr. Jean Christophe Vautrin as well as written declarations by Mr. Vladimir Lazarov and Mr. Dimitar Stefanov and expert reports by MM. Robert Duchesne, Nikolay Todorov Dikov and Lyubomir Denev. On 22 December 2005, Claimant sent English translations of some of the exhibits to its Memorial on the Merits and asked the members of the Arbitral Tribunal to incorporate into their respective copies of the Memorial corrections of some clerical errors therein.\n\n29.\n\nOn 7 February 2006, Respondent asked Claimant to produce certain documents by 28 February 2006. Although not within the time frame requested by Respondent, Claimant did submit numerous responsive documents but objected to some of Respondent\u2019s requests.\n\n30.\n\nBy e-mail and facsimile of 21 April 2006, Respondent requested an order from the Arbitral Tribunal calling upon Claimant to produce, by 5 May 2006, various documents set forth in its request of 7 February 2006 which Claimant had failed to produce.\n\n31.\n\nAfter further correspondence on this subject between the Parties and considering their respective positions, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on 27 April 2006, directing Claimant to produce to Respondent additional documents.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 22 May 2006, Respondent requested a modification of the procedural timetable, to which Claimant agreed. On 26 May 2006, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 to modify, as per the Parties\u2019 agreement, certain dates for the filing of submissions in the merits phase set forth in Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n33.\n\nFollowing the execution by the Parties of a confidentiality agreement, Claimant further produced, on 16 June 2006, two confidential documents.\n\n34.\n\nOn 28 July 2006, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits supported by statements from MM. Kaloyan Vassilev Bonev, Milcho Dimitrov Boyadzhiev, Doncho Brainov, Hristo Dimitrov, Chavdar Georgiev Georgiev, Georgi Ivanov Georgiev, Roumen Georgiev Hristov, Bojko Iliev, Krassimir Vutev Katev, Nikolay Kavardzhikliev, Lyubka Kostova, Nikola Djipov Nikolov, Nikolai Marinov Nikolov, Lyudmil Zhivkov Parvanov, Ognyan Viktorov Petkov, Aksinia Stoyanova Slavcheva, Lilia Nikolova Smokova, Tencho Ivanov Tenev, Tsvetan Tsekov, Maria Lyubenova Tsekova, Nikolay Vassilev and Svetoslav Yordanov and accompanied by legal opinions of Mr. Teodor Antonov Chipev and Professor Metody Markov as well as reports by Gaffney, Cline & Associates, Navigant Consulting, Inc. and Transacta OOD.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated 10 September 2006, Claimant notified the Tribunal and Respondent that Shearman & Sterling was no longer acting as Claimant\u2019s legal Counsel in this arbitration and requested an extension of three months for filing its Reply and such further adjustments to the procedural calendar as would consequently be required.\n\n36.\n\nIn a letter of 14 September 2006, Respondent objected to this request but urged the Arbitral Tribunal, if it should, nevertheless, grant Claimant\u2019s request, to do so only on the condition that Claimant post security in the form of a bond in the amount of no less than USD 2,000,000 against an award of costs in Respondent\u2019s favor.\n\n37.\n\nOn 20 September 2006, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 in which it (1) agreed in principle to grant a maximum three-month extension of time to Claimant for the filing of its Reply from the date of Claimant\u2019s request, (2) urged Claimant to act with the utmost diligence in appointing new Counsel, (3) stated that it would decide the consequent modification of the procedural calendar after discussion with the Parties\u2019 Counsel, including Claimant\u2019s new Counsel, in a conference call during which the Tribunal would also hear the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding Respondent\u2019s request that Claimant be ordered to post security for costs, and (4) invited Claimant to submit, by 6 October 2006, any comments it wished to make concerning Respondent\u2019s request for security for costs.\n\n38.\n\nOn 18 December 2006, Claimant informed ICSID that it had appointed new Counsel to represent it in the person of Virginie A. Colaiuta, 25 Boulevard de l\u2019Amiral Bruix, 75782 Paris Cedex 16, France.5\n\nMs. Colaiuta\u2019s address was subsequently changed to 9 rue de Picardie, 75003 Paris, France.\n\n39.\n\nThere ensued correspondence between the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal in which, among other matters, Respondent requested an increase in the amount of the security for costs that Claimant be ordered to post to USD 9,000,000 and, in addition, requested that any further proceedings in this arbitration be limited to the oral hearing, contending that Claimant had foregone its right to file any additional written submissions by failing to file its Reply by the deadline fixed in Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n40.\n\nIt proved difficult to find an early common date for the procedural meeting by conference call envisaged in Procedural Order No. 6. Consequently, the Tribunal organized a meeting in person with the Parties in Paris on 16 February 2007 to discuss Respondent\u2019s requests to limit the written phase of these proceedings and to order Claimant to post a bond as security for costs, as well as to fix a time schedule for the future conduct of the arbitration.\n\n41.\n\nAfter hearing presentations by the Parties\u2019 Counsel on Respondent\u2019s request to limit the proceedings, the Tribunal decided not to grant that request. It communicated that decision to the Parties in writing by Procedural Order No. 8, dated 21 February 2007. The Tribunal next heard the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding security for costs. The Parties and the Tribunal then discussed the further steps in these proceedings, the result of which was agreement on a procedural calendar, communicated to the Parties in Procedural Order No. 7 on 21 February 2007. Following the meeting, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 on 28 February 2007, denying Respondent\u2019s request for security for costs. ICSID issued summary minutes of the meeting.\n\n42.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 7, Claimant made requests to Respondent for the production of documents. With respect to those requests regarding which the Parties could not agree, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 deciding upon the various document production requests at issue. In an accompanying letter, the Tribunal denied Claimant\u2019s request for additional time to file its Reply.\n\n43.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 11, the Arbitral Tribunal extended Claimant\u2019s time to file its Reply by a few days.\n\n44.\n\nClaimant filed its Reply to Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on 11 April 2007, together with a second expert report by Mr. Duchesne.\n\n45.\n\nIn a letter of 25 May 2007, Ms. Colaiuta informed the Arbitral Tribunal that she was withdrawing as Counsel to Claimant. The Tribunal was subsequently advised that the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP, of 437 Madison Avenue, NY, NY, USA had been appointed by Claimant as its new Counsel.\n\n46.\n\nRespondent submitted a Rejoinder on the Merits, dated 27 July 2007, accompanied by written statements of MM. Iv\u00e1n Iskrov, Alexander Rakov, Nikloay Vassilev and Svetoslav Yordanov, as well as a legal opinion of Mr. Teodor Antonov Chipev, an expert report of Ms. Villy Dashinova-Stefanova, a supplemental expert report of Gaffney, Cline & Associates, a supplemental legal opinion of Professor Metody Markov and a second expert report of Navigant Consulting, Inc.\n\n47.\n\nA procedural meeting by telephone conference with the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal took place on 22 October 2007 for the purpose of preparing the hearing scheduled for January - February 2008 and to address certain other procedural matters. Prior to that conference, the Tribunal circulated to the Parties an agenda and requested the Parties to consult each other with a view to agreeing on a common approach to the agenda\u2019s items. The Parties submitted a joint letter dated 18 October 2007 responding to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s request. Following the telephone conference, ICSID issued summary minutes of the discussion, and the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order N\u00b0 12, dated 30 October 2007, containing its decisions and instructions regarding the matters discussed.\n\n48.\n\nOn 12 November 2007, Respondent addressed a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal objecting to certain decisions in Procedural Order N\u00b0 12. Claimant submitted its comments regarding Respondent\u2019s objections in a letter dated 13 November 2007. The Tribunal rendered its decision regarding Respondent\u2019s objections on 14 November 2007, which was communicated by ICSID to the Parties.\n\n49.\n\nOn 8 January 2008, Respondent addressed a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal objecting to the use of a specific exhibit by Claimant in the impending oral hearing. Claimant offered its comments to Respondent\u2019s objection by letter of 10 January 2008. The Tribunal rendered its decision regarding Respondent\u2019s objections on 11 January 2008, which was communicated by ICSID to the Parties.\n\n50.\n\nA hearing on the merits was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. from 28 January 2008 to 1 February 2008. Counsel for both Parties addressed the Arbitral Tribunal. One witness, Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin, and one expert, Mr. Robert Duchesne, appeared for Claimant. Five witnesses, Ms. Aksinia Stoyanova Slavcheva, Minister Nikolay Vassilev, Mr. Svetoslav Yordanov, Mr. Ognyan Viktorov Petkov and Mr. Nikola Djipov Nikolov appeared for Respondent, as well as two experts, Ms. Zo\u00eb Reeve of Gaffney, Cline & Associates and Mr. Brent Kaczmarek of Navigant Consulting, Inc. All witnesses and experts were cross-examined by opposing Counsel and reexamined by Counsel for the Party presenting them. ICSID issued summary minutes of the hearing on 13 February 2008.\n\n51.\n\nOn 20 March 2008, both Parties made written Post-Hearing Submissions.\n\n52.\n\nFinal oral argument was made by Counsel for the two Parties at a hearing in Washington, D.C. at the seat of the Centre on 14 April 2008.\n\n53.\n\nFollowing the hearing for oral argument, both Parties filed their claims for costs in written submissions dated 21 May 2008. Each Party filed written comments regarding the cost submission of the other on 4 June 2008.\n\n54.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal pronounced the proceedings closed on 9 June 2008 according to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**III. Summary of the Dispute**\n-------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe following is a summary of the dispute in the present case. Additional facts appear in Chapters IV and V, \"Discussion of the Issues,\" *infra.* The facts set forth in this Award are those which the Tribunal determines to be most relevant to its decisions on the Parties\u2019 respective cases.\n\n**A. The Refinery\u2019s Acquisition**\n---------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nPrior to its privatisation in 1996, Plama AD, which later changed its name to Nova Plama AD (\"Nova Plama\"), was a Bulgarian 100% State-owned joint stock company which owned an oil refinery (\"the Refinery\") in Bulgaria. On 5 September 1996, Bulgaria privatized Nova Plama and sold 75% of its shares to EuroEnergy Holding OOD (\"EEH\") (the \"\u20181996\u2019 or \u2018First\u2019 Privatization Agreement\", Claimant\u2019s Exhibit (\"C\u2019s Exh.\") 177). In October 1997, EEH increased Nova Plama\u2019s capital, after which EEH held 96.78% of the company\u2019s outstanding and issued share capital.\n\n57.\n\nA year later, Claimant - then known as Trammel Investment Limited -purchased from EEH all of EEH\u2019s 49,837,849 shares of Nova Plama, which represented that 96.78% shareholding. The share purchase agreement, which was subject to the consent of the Bulgarian Privatization Agency, was concluded on 18 September 1998 (C\u2019s Exh. 128). The agreement was amended on 18 December 1998 (C\u2019s Exh. 182).\n\n58.\n\nNegotiation for the purchase of Nova Plama shares started at the end of 1997 when Mr. Jean-Christophe Vautrin, who was then working at Andr\u00e9 & Cie (\"Andr\u00e9\"), a Swiss multinational company involved in trading, project and trade financing, energy and transportation, was contacted by Mr. Boni Bonev of Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et le D\u00e9veloppement (\"BICD\"). Mr. Bonev mentioned that PricewaterhouseCoopers (\"PWC\") had approached the BICD on behalf of EEH, which was seeking to obtain trade financing facilities for the Refinery (see Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 49; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 15).\n\n59.\n\nAt around the same time, Mr. Vautrin was also approached by the Central Wechsel und Creditbank, which expressed its willingness to facilitate financing for the Refinery, provided, *inter alia,* that it received a counterguarantee from various partners, including a lubricant oil specialist. Consequently, Mr. Vautrin contacted Mr. Harald Svindseth from Norwegian Oil Trading AS (\"NOT\"), a company that specialised in the distribution and fabrication of lubricants in emerging markets (see Claimant\u2019s CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 49).\n\n60.\n\nWhile Andr\u00e9 and NOT were not willing to provide financing to EEH because they doubted its trustworthiness, they expressed an interest in acquiring EEH\u2019s shares in Nova Plama. Although negotiations broke down in February 1998, they resumed later that year (see Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 52; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 17). As a result, on 18 August 1998, NOT and Andr\u00e9 entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Privatization Agency (also referred to as the \"Memorandum of Understanding\"), which was subsequently amended on 21 September 1998 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibits (\"R\u2019s Exhs.\") 664, 671), by which the Privatization Agency, in accordance with Article 22 of the First Privatization Agreement, gave consent for the sale and transfer of all shares of Nova Plama to a company presented by NOT and Andr\u00e9, provided the satisfaction of a number of conditions stated therein was assured.\n\n61.\n\nThese conditions, as amended on 21 September 1998, included *inter alia,* (i) evidence of financial resources to resume the operation of the Refinery; (ii) an agreement with the trade unions of Nova Plama; (iii) an agreement with the main creditors of Nova Plama; and (iv) an agreement with the Privatization Agency to *\u2018\u2018fake over any and all purchaser rights\"* in accordance with the First Privatization Agreement (R\u2019s Exhs. 664, 671).\n\n62.\n\nOn 5 October 1998, Claimant submitted a letter from the Central Wechsel und Creditbank stating that a USD 8 million facility *\"for start up and operation of Plama refinery is being organised with the guarantee of Andr\u00e9 & Cie S.A and Norwegian Oil Trading a.s.\"* (R\u2019s Exh. 672). On 11 October 1998, PCL signed an agreement with Nova Plama\u2019s employees (R\u2019s Exh. 673); and, on 26 October 1998, PCL and various creditors of Nova Plama entered into a Debt Settlement Agreement (R\u2019s Exh. 675).\n\n63.\n\nFinally, on 17 November 1998, Claimant and the Bulgarian Privatization Agency entered into an agreement (\"the Second Privatization Agreement,\" R\u2019s Exh. 676) specifying, *inter alia,* the obligations taken over by Claimant under the First Privatization Agreement and indicating that the date of entry into force would be the date of transfer of Nova Plama shares from EEH to PCL.\n\n64.\n\nBy letter dated 23 November 1998, the Privatization Agency informed EEH and PCL that the conditions stipulated by the Memorandum of Agreement had been met and that, consequently, the Privatization Agency gave its final consent to the transfer of shares (R\u2019s Exh. 677). Following approval by the Privatization Agency, the transfer of shares took place on 18 December 1998.\n\n65.\n\nFollowing a Bulgarian court decision in 2004 invalidating the 1997 capital increase, Nova Plama\u2019s registered share capital reverted to the original number of shares, so that Claimant then owned 75% of Nova Plama\u2019s shares (C\u2019s Exh. 183, note 14).\n\n**B. The Refinery\u2019s Operation and the Bankruptcy**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Refinery\u2019s key industrial asset was a lubricants manufacturing unit which had processed base-oils produced by the Refinery into a wide range of industrial and consumer lubricants which were used as raw materials for lubricants at the Refinery or by third party blenders. Nova Plama also had its own power plant, with a capacity for sales of excess electric power to the local grid.\n\n67.\n\nNova Plama ceased operations in 1996, while it was still State-owned, due to poor economic conditions and, during EEH\u2019s ownership, production was never resumed (Hearing Transcript (\"H. Tr.\"), Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 28 at lines 20 *et seq,* p. 85 at lines 14 *et seq).* On 10 June 1998, Bulgaria\u2019s State Fund for Reconstruction and Development initiated insolvency proceedings against Nova Plama (C\u2019s Exh. 167). It was while the insolvency proceedings were underway that EEH agreed, with the consent of the relevant Bulgarian authorities, to sell its shares in Nova Plama to Claimant and that the Second Privatization Agreement was concluded.\n\n68.\n\nThe Refinery re-commenced operations in January 1999, shortly after its acquisition by Claimant, but shut down again in early April 1999 (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paras. 37 and 156; H. Tr., Day 1, 28 January 2008, pp. 50 *et seq.* and 202 *et seq.-,* R\u2019s Exh. 376; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 46 *et seq).* Claimant and Nova Plama submitted to the Pleven District Court a Recovery Plan dated 5 May 1999, which had been negotiated with Nova Plama\u2019s creditors and other interested parties (including the Bulgarian Government). The Court approved this Recovery Plan and terminated Nova Plama\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings by decision of 8 July 1999 (R\u2019s Exh. 409). In August 1999, Nova Plama\u2019s operations resumed, but only until December 1999, when the Refinery was shut down for good (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, para. 156; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 53; H. Tr., Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 59, lines 11 *et seq.,* p. 69 lines 3 *et seq).* Discussions ensued among the various interested parties to get the Refinery back into operation, all of which failed for reasons which are at the heart of the present dispute between the Parties.\n\n69.\n\nIt should be noted that, as a provisional measure, during the 1998 insolvency proceedings, the bankruptcy court had appointed two provisional syndics or trustees in bankruptcy on 25 June 1998, Syndic Penev and Syndic Todorova (R\u2019s Exh. 898); their appointment was extended by the court\u2019s decision to open bankruptcy proceedings on 29 July 1998.\n\n70.\n\nBy decision of 18 May 1999, the Pleven District Court appointed Mr. Penev as a permanent syndic (R\u2019s Exh. 900).\n\n71.\n\nIn July 2005, creditors of Nova Plama re-opened the bankruptcy proceedings, a decision reversed by order of the Bulgarian Supreme Cassation Court of 27 December 2005 (R\u2019s Exh. 572). Upon re-fifing by the creditors of their applications, the Pleven District Court re-opened the bankruptcy proceedings on 28 April 2006 (R\u2019s Exh. 966). Nova Plama underwent liquidation and, on 18 June 2007, its assets were sold to Highway Logistics Center ECOD for approximately USD 30.6 million (R\u2019s Exh. 1036; Second Navigant Report, p. 31; H. Tr., Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 20, fines 3 *et seq.* and p. 73, fines 17 et *seq.',* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 8d).\n\n72.\n\nClaimant alleges that the Bulgarian Government, the national legislative and judicial authorities and other public authorities and agencies deliberately created numerous, grave problems for Nova Plama and/or refused or unreasonably delayed the adoption of adequate corrective measures. These actions and omissions, according to Claimant, caused material damage to the operations of the Refinery and have had a direct negative impact on the reputations and market values of the respective Plama Group companies. Bulgaria\u2019s actions and/or omissions violate the ECT, to which both Bulgaria and Cyprus are parties.6\n\nBulgaria ratified the ECT on 15 November 1996 and Cyprus on 16 January 1998.\n\n**C. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n73.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s case that, in violation of its obligations under the ECT, Bulgaria has failed to create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for Claimant\u2019s investment in Nova Plama; failed to provide Claimant\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment; and failed to provide Claimant\u2019s investment the most constant protection and security. Bulgaria has subjected Claimant\u2019s investment to unreasonable and discriminatory measures, breached its contractual obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimant, and has subjected Claimant\u2019s investment to measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation. Bulgaria\u2019s actions have, Claimant contends, deprived PCL of its chance to make its investment in Nova Plama successful and profitable (Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits, para. 44). In its Request for Arbitration, Claimant also submits that Respondent had breached its obligations under Article 10(12) of the ECT. ' It claims compensation for all of these breaches.\n\n74.\n\nRespondent denies Claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\n75.\n\nA statement of the Parties\u2019 respective positions on the issues is set forth in Chapters IV and V of this Award, in which the Tribunal examines Bulgaria\u2019s alleged breach of its obligations under the ECT and the Parties\u2019 respective positions. Before that analysis, the Tribunal will address, as a preliminary matter, the issues that were left unresolved in the Decision on Jurisdiction: Claimant\u2019s \u2018ownership\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 and the allegations on misrepresentation by Claimant.\n\n76.\n\nWhile the Tribunal will not elaborate each and every one of the Parties\u2019 arguments with respect to each issue, it has submitted all arguments to exhaustive examination. It will confine itself in the following discussion to those issues which it considers most relevant to the decisions it must make.\n\n**IV. Preliminary Discussion: Claimant\u2019s \u2018Ownership\u2019 and \u2018Control\u2019 and the Allegations of Misrepresentation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn the operative part of the Decision on Jurisdiction, quoted at paragraph 21 above, two matters were reserved for decision at a later stage: First, the question whether Claimant is a legal entity owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a State Party to the ECT - this is a question regarding the first limb of Article 17(1) of the ECT (see Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 170-178 and 240(B)(3)); and second, the question whether Claimant has misrepresented or willfully failed to disclose to Respondent Claimant\u2019s true ownership (see Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 126-131 and 228-230). These two questions will be examined in the present Section.\n\n78.\n\nIt is important to note that, in its Decision, the Tribunal made clear that none of these issues affected its jurisdiction and that, consequently, it joined them to the consideration of the merits of the case (see Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 151 and 229-230 and paras. 130-144 *infra), k* third question deferred in the Decision on Jurisdiction to this second phase of the arbitration, that of costs, is dealt with in Chapter V. F. below.\n\n**A. Is Respondent Entitled to Deny the Advantages of Part III of the ECT to Claimant under Article 17(1)?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nArticle 17 of the ECT provides:\n\n*Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part [Part III] to:*\n\n*(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized;...*\n\n80.\n\nUnder Article 17(1) of the ECT, Respondent can refuse to afford the protections of Part III of the ECT to Claimant if the latter has no substantial business activities in the State Party to the ECT where it is incorporated and if it is not owned or controlled by nationals of a Contracting Party. Both conditions must be met before a Contracting State may invoke Article 17(1). Both Parties accepted that ownership or control may be direct or indirect.\n\n81.\n\nClaimant is incorporated in Cyprus. Cyprus is a party to the ECT. Claimant has acknowledged that it does not have significant business activities in Cyprus (Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, footnote 49).\n\n82.\n\nThe question then arises whether Claimant is owned or controlled by a national or another Contracting Party. The burden of proof on this issue lies with Claimant (C\u2019s Exh. 3, p. 18, para. IV section 3).\n\n83.\n\nMr. Vautrin is a French national and, therefore, a national of a Contracting Party (France being a party to the ECT). Mr. Vautrin claims that he indirectly owns and controls 100% of the shares of PCL.\n\n84.\n\nAs previously stated (para. 57 *supra),* as a result of the Second Privatization Agreement, PCL became the owner of 96.78% of the shares of Nova Plama. At the time, Plama Holding Limited (\"PHL\"), another Cyprus company, was the beneficial owner of 100% of the shares of PCL (C\u2019s Exhs. 41, 42, 43, 93 and 94). Subsequently, PCL issued additional shares to EMU Investments Limited (\"EMU\"; C\u2019s Exhs. 51, 52 and 95), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (C\u2019s Exh. 53). As a consequence, PHL owns 20% of the shares of PCL and EMU, 80%. On 13 September 1998, PHL issued 500 shares to Mediterranean Link (Nominees) Limited and 100 shares to Mediterranean Link (Trustees) Limited, both acting as nominees of EMU. PHL also issued 400 shares to Mediterranean Link (Trustees) as nominee of NOT (C\u2019s Exhs. 47, 48 and 49). On 26 October 1998, these 400 shares were transferred from Mediterranean Link (Trustees) Limited, as nominee of NOT, to Mediterranean Link (Trustees) Limited, as nominee of EMU (C\u2019s Exh. 50). Thus, since 26 October 1998, EMU owned 100% of the shares of PHL. The capital of EMU is represented by 60 bearer shares (C\u2019s Exhs. 54 and 74), 30 of which are said by Claimant to be held in trust for Mr. Vautrin by Mr. Per Christian Nordtomme and 30 of which are said to be held in trust for Mr. Vautrin by Mr. Tom Eivind Haug (see affidavits of MM. Nordtomme and Haug, C\u2019s Exhs. 57 and 58, and statements of Mr. Vautrin).\n\n85.\n\nRespondent contends that the evidence produced by Claimant is not sufficient to establish Mr. Vautrin\u2019s indirect ownership or control of PCL. Among other matters, Respondent has produced documents which indicate that two companies incorporated in the Seychelles, Allspice Trading Inc. (\"Allspice\") and Panorama Industrial Limited (\"Panorama\") owned and may still own EMU, and that Panorama agreed to pledge 30 bearer shares in EMU to an undisclosed financial arranger (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission on Jurisdiction paras. 41 *et seq.-,* Exhs. 57 and 58 to Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission on Jurisdiction). However, Mr. Vautrin claims that the transaction underlying the pledge agreement whereby Panorama and Allspice each expected to obtain ownership of 30 bearer shares was never completed and that the pledge agreement was useless, incorrect and not valid. In any event, Mr. Vautrin testified that Allspice and Panorama were owned indirectly by him (Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Response on Jurisdiction, para. 20; Exhs. 80 and 81 to Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission on Jurisdiction).\n\n86.\n\nThe contentions of the Parties regarding the application of Article 17(1) of the ECT were fully developed during the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration and will not all be repeated here. Only those arguments most relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision are here considered.\n\n87.\n\nRespondent\u2019s contention, essentially, is that Claimant has failed to prove that it is a legal entity owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a Contracting Party to the ECT within the meaning of Article 17(1) of the ECT and, therefore, is not entitled to the benefits of Part III of the ECT. The evidence, Respondent says, shows that PCL was and is owned by EMU, which is not a national of an ECT Contracting Party. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to prove with credible evidence that Mr. Vautrin ultimately owns or controls EMU. Therefore, pursuant to Article 17(1), its claims are inadmissible.\n\n88.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent\u2019s argument that it is not entitled to the benefits of Part III because of Article 17(1), stating that Mr. Vautrin is a national of France, a Contracting Party to the ECT, and owns and controls the company, EMU, which in turn controls PHL, which controls Claimant.\n\n89.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that Article 17(1) of the ECT has no relevance to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to determine Claimant\u2019s claims against Respondent under Part III of the Treaty (para. 21 *supra).* It confirms this decision. The Tribunal will, therefore, examine Respondent\u2019s arguments concerning the ownership and control of PCL in order to determine whether they justify a denial of the benefits of Part III to Claimant. As already indicated, the burden of proof to establish ownership and Control is on Claimant.\n\n90.\n\nAs the Tribunal stated in its Decision on Jurisdiction, *\"Mr. Vautrin \u2019s evidence as to his ultimate ownership and control of the Claimant is not only largely unsupported by contemporary documentation but... is materially inconsistent with parts of that documentation and also contradicted by other statements apparently attributable to Mr. Vautrin...\"* (para. 177). On the other hand, the Tribunal noted that it did not wish to reject his evidence adduced at the jurisdictional hearing at that stage of the proceedings (para. 178). During the merits phase and at the Final Hearing, the Parties made further submissions on all the evidence submitted, including Mr. Vautrin\u2019s numerous statements and oral testimony. The Tribunal has reached the following conclusions on these disputed matters.\n\n91.\n\nAs seen above, 20% of PCL\u2019s shares are owned by PHL, another Cyprus-incorporated company (para. 84 *supra)* and 80% of PCL\u2019s shares are held by EMU. EMU owns 100% of PHL\u2019s shares. Mr. Vautrin\u2019s testimony and the affidavits of MM. Nordtomme and Haug indicate that the latter each hold half of EMU\u2019s shares in trust for Mr. Vautrin. The record also contains documents or affidavits from other persons acting for the companies concerned to the effect that they were always acting pursuant to instructions received from Mr. Vautrin. Andr\u00e9 and NOT have written that they were not shareholders at the time of the Second Privatization Agreement (Exhs. 20 and 23 to Mr. Vautrin\u2019s Third Declaration). Moreover, when testifying before the Tribunal and in his witness statements, Mr. Vautrin demonstrated an intimate knowledge of the structure and affairs of the companies concerned, which lend credence to Claimant\u2019s contention that he does own or control them.\n\n92.\n\nAs for the evidence introduced by Respondent that the shares of EMU were transferred to two Seychelles companies, Panorama and Allspice, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts Mr. Vautrin\u2019s testimony that the transactions, which were contemplated, were never in fact consummated and that, in any event, he was and remains the ultimate owner of the shares of those two companies.\n\n93.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has also considered the fact that there is litigation pending in Switzerland, discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, in which a company, Dolsamex S.A., and Mr. Timothy O\u2019Neill claim ownership of PCL. However, until that litigation is completed, those claims remain just that: mere claims with allegations that cannot and do not affect the ownership or control of PCL.\n\n94.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal accepts Mr. Vautrin\u2019s testimony. Moreover, without losing sight of the fact that Claimant bears the burden of proof on this issue, the Arbitral Tribunal has not found Respondent\u2019s attempt to cast doubt on Mr. Vautrin\u2019s ownership and control of PCL convincing. Respondent has not been able to show to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction that the evidence produced by Claimant as to its ownership is wholly unreliable nor has it introduced cogent evidence as to who is (or are) the persons or entities who own or control the company, other than Mr. Vautrin.\n\n95.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that Mr. Vautrin owns and controls PCL. Since Mr. Vautrin is a French national (Exh. 1 to Mr. Vautrin\u2019s First Declaration, 25 March 2004), and France is a Contracting Party to the ECT, Respondent cannot rely on Article 17(1) of the ECT to deny to PCL the benefits of Part III of the Treaty.\n\n**B. Misrepresentation**\n------------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n96.\n\nRespondent, at the jurisdictional hearing, in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, Rejoinder on the Merits and Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits, raises objections to jurisdiction over and admissibility of Claimant\u2019s claims. It says that Claimant obtained its investment in Nova Plama via misrepresentations in violation of Bulgarian law, which is, therefore, void *ab initio* under the Privatisation Act and voidable under the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act. Accordingly, Claimant does not own the investment and did not acquire control of it in accordance with Bulgarian law. As a consequence, there is no \"Investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT, and hence the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims. Even if the Tribunal were to conclude that it did have jurisdiction, however, Claimant having obtained its investment by unlawful means would render its claim inadmissible.\n\n97.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that Respondent\u2019s allegations on misrepresentation did not deprive it of jurisdiction in this case and, in light of the serious charges raised, the Tribunal decided to examine these allegations during the merits phase.\n\n98.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, Rejoinder on the Merits and PostHearing Submission on the Merits, Respondent insisted that obtaining the investment via misrepresentation in violation of Bulgarian law made Claimant\u2019s claims inadmissible and, in any event, such misrepresentations defeated its claims on the merits. Since the protections provided in Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT can only apply to an Investment made in accordance with law, Claimant cannot seek the protections of the ECT for that investment, having obtained it in violation of international and Bulgarian law.\n\n99.\n\nIn addition, Respondent pointed out that Bulgaria denied Claimant the advantages of the ECT\u2019s substantive protections prospectively from 18 February 2003. Consequently, to the extent that Claimant seeks to present claims in these proceedings as to alleged violations by Respondent of ECT obligations after that date *(e.g.,* claims relating to the re-opened bankruptcy proceedings against Nova Plama in 2005 and claims regarding Varna Port based on facts arising after 18 February 2003), those claims are inadmissible.7\n\nThis argument is no longer relevant, since in this Award the Arbitral Tribunal has decided that Bulgaria cannot deny the benefits of Part III to Claimant on the basis of Article 17(1) of the ECT, see paragraph 95 *supra.*\n\n100.\n\nIn support of its allegation of misrepresentation, Respondent contends that Mr. Vautrin and others representing Claimant during the negotiations for the acquisition of Nova Plama consistently represented to the Bulgarian Privatization Agency and others that Claimant was a consortium owned by two large commercial entities, Andr\u00e9 and NOT. According to Respondent, after these entities withdrew their interest in the investment, Mr. Vautrin intentionally concealed that fact and the fact that he was the sole owner of Claimant. Although Mr. Vautrin contends that he informed someone at some point within the Bulgarian Government of Andre\u2019s and NOT\u2019s withdrawal, Respondent asserts that this remains unproven.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant was obliged to obtain the consent of the Privatization Agency to its purchase of EEH\u2019s shares in Nova Plama. This was a requirement of EEH\u2019s 1996 Privatization Agreement and the Bulgarian Privatization Act. Respondent says that Claimant procured the Privatization Agency\u2019s consent by means of misrepresentations as to Claimant\u2019s actual ownership, in violation of Bulgarian law. The consent thus obtained was null and void under Bulgarian law. According to Respondent, because the consent of the Privatization Agency was a legal prerequisite to Claimant\u2019s purchase and also a legal prerequisite to the lawfulness and effectiveness of the Share Purchase Agreement between Claimant and EEH (pursuant to which Claimant acquired the shares in Nova Plama that it claims as its investment), Claimant neither owns nor acquired control of its investment in accordance with Bulgarian law and the ECT.\n\n102.\n\nRespondent cites Article 5(1) of the Bulgarian Privatization Act *\"...[transactions for acquisition under the Act conducted through a fictitious party or by an unidentified proxy shall be deemed null and void\"* and states that Claimant misrepresented its ownership and misled the Privatization Agency within the meaning of Article 5(1) in order to obtain the latter\u2019s consent to PCL\u2019s acquisition of Nova Plama, thus rendering that consent null and void *ab initio.*\n\n103.\n\nRespondent contends that the existence of an \"Investment\" within the meaning of the ECT is a fundamental element necessary for the observance of Article 26 of the ECT. In view of the lack of an Investment within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT, Respondent asserts, this case should be dismissed.\n\n104.\n\nRespondent adds that, under international and Bulgarian law, Claimant had an obligation to act honestly and in good faith in its dealings and contract negotiations and that it violated this obligation.\n\n105.\n\nAlternatively, Respondent contends that, should the Arbitral Tribunal not find the Second Privatization Agreement null and void under Article 5.1 of the Privatization Law, that agreement would be voidable under Bulgarian law due to Claimant\u2019s misrepresentations.\n\n106.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument under the ECT is that Claimant\u2019s misrepresentation defeats its claim on the merits. The obligations undertaken by Bulgaria under Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT can only apply to an Investment made in accordance with law. Respondent asserts that, having obtained its investment in violation of international and Bulgarian law, Claimant cannot seek the protections of the ECT for that investment.\n\n107.\n\nClaimant denies that it made any misrepresentation to the Bulgarian Government concerning its investment in Nova Plama. It says it had no duty to inform Respondent of the identity of the shareholder(s) of PCL. Claimant acknowledges, in its Memorial on the Merits, that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were originally interested in buying the Refinery and accepts that the Bulgarian Government, through its Privatization Agency, wanted to screen foreign investors in privatized enterprises (see para. 27). Claimant contends that during the period July-September 1998, Andr\u00e9 decided that it was not interested in purchasing Nova Plama and only wanted to play an advisory role; so Mr. Vautrin personally took up the opportunity, together with NOT, to make the investment *(ibid.,* para. 30, p. 9).8 Subsequently, NOT, too, withdrew from the project as an investor.\n\nMr. Vautrin testified at the January-February 2008 hearing (H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 280) that NOT held 40 percent of the shares of PCL until the end of October 1998\n\n108.\n\nClaimant says that it informed the Privatization Agency that the purchase of Nova Plama\u2019s shares was to be made by a company *\"presented by\"* Andr\u00e9 and NOT - not that the purchase was to be made by Andr\u00e9 and NOT themselves -and that this description of the purchaser was included in the Memorandum of Agreement of 18 August 1998 (Article 1.1), agreeing to the share transfer by EEH to PCL, signed on behalf of the Privatization Agency and PCL. According to Claimant, this wording of the Memorandum of Agreement followed an earlier draft of the agreement, which is not in the record, which stipulated that the company purchasing Nova Plama\u2019s shares was a company *\"formed by\"* Andr\u00e9 and NOT (See Mr. Vautrin\u2019s testimony at the January -February 2008 hearing, H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, pp. 305 *et seq.).* Therefore, Claimant says, the Privatization Agency knew or should have known that a company different from Andr\u00e9 or NOT was the purchaser. If the Privatization Agency wanted to receive specific information about the change in the language of the agreement and ownership of the investor to be introduced by Andr\u00e9 and NOT, it could, contends Claimant, have asked for that information. In fact, Claimant says, the Privatization Agency was not interested in the identity of the investor\u2019s shareholders and never asked; they simply wanted the investor to undertake the obligations in the Second Privatization Agreement, which Claimant did. Mr. Vautrin also testified that he had told relevant members of the Bulgarian Government that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were not to be the ultimate purchasers of Nova Plama\u2019s shares (H. Tr. in French, Mr. Vautrin, 20 September 2004, p. 19).\n\n109.\n\nClaimant further contends that nowhere is it accused of having made a positive misrepresentation, that is, Claimant is not accused of having falsely informed the Privatization Agency about its ownership. Therefore, there is no proof of a \"wrong by Claimant\" and Respondent\u2019s allegations are only limited to the subjective impressions of various Bulgarian authorities.\n\n110.\n\nMoreover, Claimant contends that Article 5(1) of the Privatization Act invoked by Respondent is not applicable to this case since the purchase of Nova Plama shares by PCL from EEH did not correspond to a privatization. According to Claimant, the Refinery had already been privatized after its sale to EEH in 1996. If Respondent retained the right to consent to any further sale, such consent was foreseen only for the sale of a minority of Nova Plama shares.\n\n111.\n\nClaimant adds that, even if there were a \"passive misrepresentation\", as alleged by Respondent, the consent of the Privatization Agency was necessary, if at all, only for the purchase of a minor portion of the shares of Nova Plama -4.5 million shares out of 51 million. This is so, Claimant contends, because, after the initial privatization of Nova Plama, EEH had increased the company\u2019s capital. Consequently, it was possible for Claimant to purchase from EEH 90% of the shares, which represented the increased capital not covered by the First Privatization Agreement, without the need for any consent from the Privatization Agency. Moreover, even without the consent of the Privatization Agency, Claimant says, it would have owned and made an Investment within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT, which entitles it to the protection in Part III of the ECT.\n\n**2. The Requirement of Approval by the Privatization Agency**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s argument, the matter of the alleged misrepresentation by Claimant does not pertain to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: that was already decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction (paras. 126-130 and 228-230). Rather, the matter concerns the question as to whether Claimant is entitled to the substantive protections offered by the ECT.\n\n113.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not accept Claimant\u2019s argument that no approval by the Privatization Agency was necessary for PCL\u2019s acquisition of Nova Plama\u2019s shares because those shares had already been privatized under the First Privatization Agreement. Claimant itself did not at the time act in a manner consistent with the case it is now advancing; it actively sought and obtained the Privatization Agency\u2019s approval to purchase Nova Plama\u2019s shares from EEH. The First Privatization Agreement was clear, in its Article 22, that EEH did not have the right to sell or transfer Nova Plama\u2019s shares for a period of five years without the prior approval of the Privatization Agency. When EEH did, within that period, sell its shares to PCL, the Privatization Agency\u2019s approval was, therefore, required. Claimant\u2019s submission that, even without the Privatization Agency\u2019s agreement, it would have made an Investment within the meaning of ECT is irrelevant because, in fact, it sought and obtained the Privatization Agency\u2019s consent to its purchase of the Refinery.\n\n114.\n\nNor does the Arbitral Tribunal accept Claimant\u2019s contention that, if any authorization or approval of the Privatization Agency were required, it only pertained to 10% of Nova Plama\u2019s shares. Claimant\u2019s case is based on the fact that, after the First Privatization Agreement, Nova Plama\u2019s share capital was increased and that Article 22 of the First Privatization Agreement only applied to the shares existing at the time of the first privatization. While the language of Article 22, *\"[t]he Buyer shall not have the right to sell or transfer*  *the shares acquired under this Contract*...\" (emphasis added), if literally read, could be interpreted in the manner contended by Claimant, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that that was what the Parties intended. Again, Claimant did not in 1998, when it sought and obtained the approval of the Privatization Agency for its purchase of Nova Plama\u2019s shares, act in conformity with the case it is now advancing. It sought approval for the purchase of *all* of Nova Plama\u2019s then-outstanding shares.\n\n115.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has now to determine whether the alleged misrepresentation did in fact occur as alleged by Respondent, and, if so, what the consequences are for the application of the protections provided under the ECT claimed by Claimant.\n\n**3. The Occurrence of Misrepresentation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Respondent\u2019s factual allegation as to the occurrence of misrepresentation by Claimant. It is important here to review the most pertinent elements which lead the Tribunal to this conclusion.\n\n117.\n\nBy Order No. 456 of 7 August 1998, the Executive Director of the Privatization Agency established an inter-institutional working group of experts to prepare the transfer of Nova Plama shares from EEH to the Consortium Andr\u00e9 and NOT. On the same date, the Privatization Agency wrote a letter to EEH and to the *\"Coordinator of the Consortium,\"* Mr. Boni Bonev, announcing that it would give its consent for EEH to transfer its shares in Nova Plama to *\"the Consortium \u2018Andr\u00e9 & Cie and Norwegian Oil Trading\"'* in case an agreement were signed with the Consortium for *\"updating and unconditional fulfilment of the obligations already undertaken with the signed contract\"* (R\u2019s Exhs. 658, 659).\n\n118.\n\nErnst & Young sent a letter on 11 August 1998 to the Privatization Agency, indicating that the foreign investor Andr\u00e9 & Cie had assigned to it the conduct of due diligence of Nova Plama in view of signing a contract for the purchase of shares in the company (R\u2019s. Exh. 660).\n\n119.\n\nOn 14 August 1998, the Privatization Agency sent a letter to Mr. Bonev enclosing a draft agreement between the consortium *\"Andr\u00e9 & Cie and Norwegian Oil Trading\"* and the Privatization Agency (R\u2019s. Exh. 197).\n\n120.\n\nThereafter \u2014 and in accordance with the draft agreement - a Memorandum of Agreement was made on 18 August 1998 by NOT and Andr\u00e9, represented by Mr. Bonev, and the Privatization Agency for the sale of all shares of Nova Plama to a company presented by NOT and Andr\u00e9. The agreement was signed by Mr. Bonev *\"For company\"* (R\u2019s. Exh. 198). Mr. Bonev provided to the Privatization Agency two powers of attorney to act on behalf of Andr\u00e9 & Cie and NOT. The first document was dated 17 August 1998 and signed by W. Brocard and J.C. Vautrin in the name of Andr\u00e9 & Cie, to represent it *\"in the negotiations to be held with relevant Bulgarian authorities regarding Plama project.\"* The second document was also dated 17 August 1998 and was signed by Bom Kanppskig and Torgeir Lien to *\"negotiate and sign the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Plama AD on our behalf* (R\u2019s Exhs. 662, 663).\n\n121.\n\nOn August 20, 1998, the Privatization Agency sent two letters to record that a Memorandum of Agreement had been signed between the Agency, on the one hand, and Andr\u00e9 and NOT, on the other, authorizing the transfer of Nova Plama shares to a company presented by NOT and Andr\u00e9. The first letter was sent to EEH and Mr. Bonev as the *\"Consortium Coordinator\"* and the second one, to Mr. Radev, Minister of Finance.\n\n122.\n\nWhile Claimant made much of the argument that the language *\"a company presented by NOT and Andr\u00e9\"* did not mean a company *owned* by NOT and Andr\u00e9, at the January-February 2008 hearing, Mr. Vautrin testified that, at the time when Andr\u00e9 and NOT were still contemplating purchasing the Refinery, a July 1998 version of the Memorandum of Understanding (R\u2019s Exh. 657) used similar terminology: *\"a corporation to be introduced by Andr\u00e9 and Norwegian Oil Trading.\"* How Bulgaria was reasonably to understand without an explicit explanation that virtually the same language was to mean different things at different times has not been explained by Claimant (H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, pp. 265 *et seq).* In addition, the evidence, as set out in this section, indicates that the Privatization Agency had strong reasons to believe that NOT and Andr\u00e9 were part of the consortium.\n\n123.\n\nThe Business Plan presented by MM. Bonev and Vautrin to the creditors of Nova Plama in September 1998 described the *\"Consortium\"* which would *\"revive\"* the Refinery as consisting of NOT, Andr\u00e9, Ing\u00e9rop and Ernst & Young. This is one of the puzzling elements of the misrepresentation issue, because it is difficult to believe that anyone could reasonably consider Ernst & Young and Ing\u00e9rop as investors. The same is not true for NOT and Andr\u00e9. Throughout the Business Plan, reference was made to the measures to be undertaken by the Consortium to resume operation of the Refinery. Information detailing the organization and experience of NOT and Andr\u00e9 was provided as Annexes 1 and 2 to the Business Plan (R\u2019s Exh. 669).\n\n124.\n\nOn 8 September 1998, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to Mr. Bonev, as *\"representative of Norwegian Oil Trading A.S and Andr\u00e9 & Cie\",* inviting him to a meeting on the following day, in view of the intentions expressed by both companies to acquire the shares of Nova Plama (R\u2019s Exh. 667). This and similar statements made in the correspondence exchanged at that time, were never corrected by Mr. Bonev, Mr. Vautrin or anyone else on Claimant\u2019s side.\n\n125.\n\nThe meeting was held on 9 September 1998 with representatives of the Bulgarian Government, including the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Labour, Mr. Bonev, Mr. Vautrin and Mr. Nordtomme as representatives of the Consortium, as well as the Ambassador of Switzerland, who vouched for the good standing of Andr\u00e9 (R\u2019s. Exh. 668 and witness statement of Mrs. Slavcheva, 28 July 2006). According to Mr. Vautrin, this meeting occurred after Andr\u00e9 had decided to withdraw as an investor (H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 279). There was no apparent Swiss interest other than Andr\u00e9.\n\n126.\n\nThe \"Additional Agreement to the Memorandum of Understanding\" dated 21 September 1998 named Andr\u00e9 and NOT as parties and was signed by Mr. Bonev, this time, on behalf of Andr\u00e9 and NOT (R\u2019s. Exh. 671).\n\n127.\n\nMr. Vautrin has testified on several occasions that he had informed relevant Bulgarian authorities that Andr\u00e9 and NOT had decided not to be investors (see, *e.g.,* H. Trans., in French, Mr. Vautrin, 20 September 2004, p. 19 and H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 295). However, these statements contradict declarations made by the authorities concerned, in particular, Mr. Oresharski (who was the Minister of Finance at the time of the Hearing and the former Deputy Minister of Finance at the time of the transaction) and Mr. Palazov (the Secretary-General of the Agency of State Receivables). They declared that it was their clear understanding, at all relevant times, that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were to be the ultimate purchasers of Nova Plama (H. Tr. Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 329, lines 1 *et seq.',* witness statement of Mr. Oresharki, at paras. 7, 9; and witness statement of Mr. Palazov, at para. 10).9 Moreover, Mr. Rakov, deputy of the Ministry of Finance, submitted a statement expressly denying Mr. Vautrin\u2019s assertions that Mr. Vautrin had informed him that NOT had withdrawn from PCL (witness statement of Mr. Rakov, paras. 5.6; H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 333, lines 2 *et seq).*\n\nThis understanding was confirmed by other Bulgarian authorities including Ms. Slavcheva (in her witness statement and during her cross-examination at the Final Hearing, H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 450) and Mr. Tenev.\n\n128.\n\nThe conclusion which the Arbitral Tribunal draws from all of these elements is that the Bulgarian Government clearly understood NOT and Andr\u00e9 to be the investors (see, *e.g.,* R\u2019s Exh. 39) and that PCL - the *\"company presented by\"* them - was a special purpose vehicle created by them as a consortium for the purpose of the Nova Plama acquisition (see Mr. Vautrin\u2019s testimony, H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, p. 310).\n\n129.\n\nIt also appears to the Arbitral Tribunal that Mr. Vautrin did nothing to remove this misunderstanding, of which he was undoubtedly aware. In particular, Mr. Vautrin deliberately did not inform the Bulgarian Government that he was the sole, ultimate owner of PCL (Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 124 and 129). Mr. Vautrin testified during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration that, for reasons of personal security, he did not want the Bulgarian Government to know that he was the investor who owned and controlled PCL (see Mr. Vautrin\u2019s Third Witness Declaration, 26 August 2004, at para. 8 *et seq.* and H. Tr. Jurisdictional Phase, pp. 65-7). However, Mr. Vautrin has insisted throughout the arbitration that he never represented to the Bulgarian Government that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were the investors. As noted earlier (para. 108 *supra),* Mr. Vautrin testified that he did inform certain Bulgarian officials that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were not investors. His testimony, also referred to earlier, that a comparison of the language *\"formed by\"* in an early draft of the Memorandum of Understanding (which is not in the record) with the final text *\"presented by\"* showed clearly that Andr\u00e9 and NOT were not shareholders cannot be verified (H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, pp. 295 *et seq.)* and is contested by Respondent (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits, para. 15). What is clear is that Mr. Vautrin was determined not to disclose his true role in the privatization and, by doing so, he deliberately misrepresented to the Bulgarian authorities the true identity of the investors in Nova Plama.\n\n**4. The Consequences of the Misrepresentation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimant\u2019s investment is null and void under Article 5.1 of the Privatization Act (para. 102 *supra),* when examined in light of the terms of this so-called \"straw man\" provision. Counsel for Respondent explained in the January-February 2008 hearing that the straw man in the present case was Mr. Vautrin, acting *as if* he were the representative of Andr\u00e9 when in fact he was acting for his own account (H. Tr., Day 2, 29 January 2008, pp. 463-4).10 In the opinion of Respondent\u2019s legal expert, Professor Markov, dated 16 July 2006, an \"unidentified proxy\" within the meaning of Article 5.1: *\"acts in his own name but on the ultimate account of and in the ultimate benefit of somebody else\"* (para. 54). This is not what happened here. The party to the Second Privatization Agreement, *i.e.,* the party making the investment, was PCL, not Mr. Vautrin. PCL was not a \"straw man\" acting for someone else; it was acting for its own account.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits, Respondent changed its identification of the straw man as being Andr\u00e9 and NOT whom Mr. Vautrin used as straw men to conclude the transactions (para. 30).\n\n131.\n\nProfessor Markov cites a Bulgarian Supreme Court decision, in paragraph 55 of his 16 July 2006 opinion, as follows:\n\n*What is an interpositioned person? The concept of interpositioned person, known also in legal theory as \"straw man\" or \"wooden head,\" requires the existence of an agreement between the real right-holder (real party) under the* *contract, i.e. the person economically interested in the transaction who actually enters into it, and the interpositioned person. Under this agreement the interpositioned person gives his consent that his name will appear in the real estate contract as though he is the party to the contract, whereas the contract is actually between the economically interested person and a third person, the other party to the contract.*\n\n132.\n\nIn paragraph 56 of his 16 July 2006 opinion, Professor Markov cites the treatise, \"Civil Law - General Part\" by Professor Pavlova:\n\n*\u00a7 5 of the Additional Provisions of TPSOMEA* (the Privatization Act) *deserves to be noted among the cases of invalidity for prohibition provided for in special legal provisions. Pursuant to this provision the acquisition transactions under this Act shall be invalid where they are executed through an interpositioned person or an undisclosed representative. The law refers to the cases where the transferee under the privatization transaction conceals his name using another person\u2019s name (interpositioned person) or where a person in his own name acquires privatized property acting as a mandatary (a party to a mandate contract) on somebody else\u2019s account and with an obligation to transfer the property acquired to the principal. The severe sanction, envisaged in the provision in question, is designed by the legislator to provide maximum transparency in the acquisitions through privatization transactions. The requirement to reveal the identity of the transferee under the transaction constitutes a guarantee against abuse of official and social position and allows the public to watch closely whether the law is circumvented through follow up actions.*\n\nHere, again, we are not dealing with a person who used the name of another person while entering into the Privatization Agreement, nor is the contract signatory acting as a *mandatary* for somebody else\u2019s account and with an obligation to transfer the investment to the principal. In the present case, PCL was the contracting party, acting for its own account and in its own name.\n\n133.\n\nRather, what happened here was that Mr. Vautrin and his representatives presented PCL as a consortium of major companies having substantial assets, whereas in truth, Mr. Vautrin, who personally did not have significant financial resources, was acting alone as the sole investor in the guise of that \"consortium.\" The Arbitral Tribunal is persuaded that Bulgaria would not have given its consent to the transfer of Nova Plama\u2019s shares to PCL had it known it was simply a corporate cover for a private individual with limited financial resources. Given the strategic importance of the Refinery and the significant number of employees and creditors, the managerial and financial capacities of the acquirer were a natural concern to the Bulgarian authorities. Andr\u00e9, as a world-wide trader and financial institution and NOT as an experienced oil company, appeared to have the required capacities. Mr. Vautrin alone did not.\n\n134.\n\nClaimant contends that it acted in good faith, that Respondent never asked who the shareholders of PCL were and that Claimant had no obligation to volunteer this information. The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that, in the circumstances of the present case, this contention can be accepted. Claimant represented to the Bulgarian Government that the investor was a consortium -which was true during the early stages of negotiations. It then failed, deliberately, to inform Respondent of the change in circumstances, which the Tribunal considers would have been material to Respondent\u2019s decision to accept the investment. On the basis of the evidence in the record, Bulgaria had no reason to suspect that the original composition of the consortium, consisting of two major experienced companies, had changed to an individual investor acting in the guise of that \"consortium\", and no duty to ask. It was Claimant, knowing the facts, which had an obligation to inform Respondent.\n\n135.\n\nThe investment in Nova Plama was, therefore, the result of a deliberate concealment amounting to fraud, calculated to induce the Bulgarian authorities to authorize the transfer of shares to an entity that did not have the financial and managerial capacities required to resume operation of the Refinery. While the Arbitral Tribunal considers that this situation does not involve the \"straw-man\" provision set out in the Bulgarian Privatization Law, the Tribunal is of the view that this behavior is contrary to other provisions of Bulgarian law and to international law and that it, therefore, precludes the application of the protections of the ECT.\n\n136.\n\nAs noted by Professor Markov in his expert report, Articles 27 and 29 of the Obligations and Contracts Acts (OCA) state:11\n\n*Art. 27. Contracts concluded by persons of legal incapacity, or by their agents without observing the requirements established for such agents, as well as contracts concluded under mistake, fraud, duress or extreme necessity shall be subject to invalidation.*\n\n*Art. 29. Fraud shall constitute grounds for invalidating a contract provided that one of the parties has been misled by the other party into concluding the contract through intentional misrepresentation.*\n\nIn addition, Article 12 OCA introduces the principle of good faith by stating that *\"parties must negotiate and enter contracts in good faith.\"* According to Bulgaria\u2019s expert, this principle covers various obligations of the parties, including the obligation to inform the other party of all facts relevant to making a decision concerning the conclusion of the contract.12\n\nLegal Opinion of Professor Markov, dated 16 July 2006, para. 64.\n\n*Ibid,* para 71.\n\n137.\n\nThe negotiation and conclusion of the Second Privatization Agreement were carried out by PCL and its owner, Mr. Vautrin, in flagrant violation of these provisions of Bulgarian law. The misrepresentation made by Claimant renders the Agreement unlawful.\n\n138.\n\nUnlike a number of Bilateral Investment Treaties,13 the ECT does not contain a provision requiring the conformity of the Investment with a particular law. This does not mean, however, that the protections provided for by the ECT cover all kinds of investments, including those contrary to domestic or international law. As noted by the Chairman\u2019s statement at the adoption session of the ECT on 17 December 1994:\n\n*[...] the Treaty shall be applied and interpreted in accordance with generally recognized rules and principles of observance, application and interpretation of treaties as reflected in Part III of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 25 May 1969. [...] The Treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.14*\n\nFor example the Germany-Philippines BIT, Lithuania-Ukraine BIT, and Italy-Morocco BIT.\n\nEnergy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents. A Legal Framework for International Energy Cooperation,* Chairman\u2019s Statement at Adoption Session on 17 December 1994, p. 158.\n\n139.\n\nIn accordance with the introductory note to the ECT *\"[t]he fundamental aim of the Energy Charter Treaty is to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues* [...]\".15 Consequently, the ECT should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the aim of encouraging respect for the rule of law. The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments that are made contrary to law.\n\nEnergy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents. A Legal Framework for International Energy Cooperation,* An Introduction to the Energy Charter Treaty, p. 14.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the investment in this case violates not only Bulgarian law, as noted above, but also *\"applicable rules and principles of international law\",* in conformity with Article 26(6) of the ECT which states that \"[a] *tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law\".* In order to identify these applicable rules and principles, the Arbitral Tribunal finds helpful guidance in the decisions made in other investment arbitrations cited by Respondent.\n\n141.\n\nIn *Inceysa v. El Salvador16* a case in which the investor procured a concession contract for vehicle inspection services in El Salvador through fraud in the public bidding process, the tribunal found that the investment violated the following general principles of law: (i) the principle of good faith defined as the *\"absence of deceit and artifice during the negotiation and execution of instruments that gave rise to the investment\"17* and (ii) the principle of *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans -* that nobody can benefit from his own wrong - understood as the prohibition for an investor to *\"benefit from an investment effectuated by means of one or several illegal acts\".18* In addition, the tribunal found that recognizing the existence of rights arising from illegal acts would violate the \"respect for the law\" which is a principle of international public policy.19\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador,* Award of 2 August 2006, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26 (\"Inceysa\").\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 231.\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 240-242.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 249.\n\n142.\n\nThe notion of international public policy was also invoked by an award in the case of *World Duty Free v. Kenya.20* In this case, the investor had obtained a contract by paying a bribe to the Kenyan President. According to the tribunal, the term \"international public policy\" was interpreted to signify *\"an international consensus as to universal standards and accepted norms of conduct that must be applied in all fora.\"21* Accordingly, the tribunal found that *\"claims based on contracts of corruption or contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral Tribunal.\"22* The tribunal further concluded that *\"as regards public policy both under English and Kenyan law [...] the Claimant is not legally entitled to maintain any of its pleaded claims in these proceedings on the ground of* ex turpi causa non oritur actio.\"23 As explained in the award, the *ex turpi causa* defence *\"rests on a principle of public policy that the courts will not assist a plaintiff who has been guilty of illegal (or immoral) conduct [...].\"24*\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v. The Republic of Kenya,* Award of 4 October 2006, ICSID Case No. Arb/00/7.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 139.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 157.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 179.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 161.\n\n143.\n\nClaimant, in the present case, is requesting the Tribunal to grant its investment in Bulgaria the protections provided by the ECT. However, the Tribunal has decided that the investment was obtained by deceitful conduct that is in violation of Bulgarian law. The Tribunal is of the view that granting the ECT\u2019s protections to Claimant\u2019s investment would be contrary to the principle *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans* invoked above. It would also be contrary to the basic notion of international public policy - that a contract obtained by wrongful means (fraudulent misrepresentation) should not be enforced by a tribunal.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant\u2019s conduct is contrary to the principle of good faith which is part not only of Bulgarian law - as indicated above at paragraphs 135-136- but also of international law - as noted by the tribunal in the *Inceysa* case. The principle of good faith encompasses, *inter alia,* the obligation for the investor to provide the host State with relevant and material information concerning the investor and the investment. This obligation is particularly important when the information is necessary for obtaining the State's approval of the investment.\n\n145.\n\nClaimant contended that it had no obligation to disclose to Respondent who its real shareholders were. This may be acceptable in some cases but not under the present circumstances in which the State\u2019s approval of the investment was required as a matter of law and dependant on the financial and technical qualifications of the investor. If a material change occurred in the investor\u2019s shareholding that could have an effect on the host State\u2019s approval, the investor was, by virtue of the principle of good faith, obliged to inform the host State of such change. Intentional withholding of this information is therefore contrary to the principle of good faith.\n\n146.\n\nIn consideration of the above and in light of the *ex turpi causa* defence, this Tribunal cannot lend its support to Claimant\u2019s request and cannot, therefore, grant the substantive protections of the ECT.\n\n**V. Discussion of the Issues - Claimant\u2019s Claims on the Merits**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe Parties have extensively documented their allegations; numerous exhibits, witness statements and expert reports have been submitted by both Parties. The factual and legal arguments have been discussed in detail during the Final Hearing, in which a number of witnesses and experts were also examined by the Parties and the arbitrators. The Tribunal has therefore decided that, in acknowledgement of the Parties\u2019 efforts, it will consider their further allegations on the merits. This consideration will lead to the conclusion that, even if Claimant would have had the benefit of the substantive protections of the ECT, Claimant\u2019s claims on the merits would have failed.\n\n148.\n\nIn its analysis, the Tribunal will follow Claimant\u2019s presentation of the allegedly unlawful acts and omissions by Respondent (Section C). Accordingly, the Tribunal will first address the allegations regarding environmental damages (Section C.l *infra),* followed by the allegations regarding the action of the syndics (Section C.2 *infra),* the so-called paper profits (Section C.3 *infra),* the privatization of the Varna Port (Section C.4 *infra)* and Biochim Bank\u2019s unlawful breaches of its debt settlement agreement with PCL (Section C.5 *infra).* Before addressing these allegations, the Arbitral Tribunal will consider the ECT protections invoked by Claimant (Section B *infra).* It will rely on those considerations in its subsequent analysis. The Tribunal will commence by presenting a summary of the Parties\u2019 contentions on the merits and the relief sought (Section A *infra).*\n\n**A. Summary of the Contentions of the Parties and Relief Sought**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAccording to Claimant, despite the promises made at the pre-acquisition stage, the Bulgarian Government, its legislative and judicial bodies and other State organs and agencies *\"dashed\"* Nova Plama\u2019s prospects of success. PCL found itself *\"a victim of a series of unlawful acts and omissions which individually* *and cumulatively defeated its efforts to operate the Refinery beyond 1999 and make good its investment.\"* (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, para. 9). These unlawful acts and omissions included:\n\n(i) *Environmental damages'.* Bulgaria\u2019s sudden and unfair amendment of its environmental law to exclude the State\u2019s liability for past environmental damages at the Refinery site, effectively making Nova Plama and PCL liable instead;\n\n(ii) *Paper Profits'.* Bulgaria\u2019s failure to amend its corporate income tax laws in a timely manner to enable PCL to file Nova Plama\u2019s annual accounts;\n\n(iii) *Varna Port',* the unlawful *de facto* privatization of the Varna Port, which Nova Plama relied upon for its crude oil supply;\n\n(iv) *Actions of the Syndics',* the unlawful actions of Nova Plama\u2019s syndics who, *inter alia,* instigated a riot at the Refinery which resulted in the first shutdown of the Refinery in April 1999; and\n\n(v) *Biochim Bank',* the State-owned Biochim Bank\u2019s deliberate breaches of its debt settlement agreement with PCL.\n\n150.\n\nClaimant alleges that, as a result of these actions, it was unable to secure any working capital financing for Nova Plama since the financial institutions that were initially involved withdrew from the project, and other financial institutions simply refused to participate. Nova Plama was obliged to close the Refinery indefinitely on 15 December 1999 and was consequently unable to settle its debts under the Recovery Plan. Its creditors re-opened the insolvency proceedings against it; and a Bulgarian court ordered the liquidation of Nova Plama in July 2005. Claimant asserts that it has therefore been deprived of all economic benefit and use of its investment since 15 December 1999.\n\n151.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s view that these acts are wholly the responsibility of Bulgaria and constitute a violation of several of the protections owed by Bulgaria under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT. In particular, Claimant alleges that Bulgaria has:\n\n(a) failed to create a stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for making the investment;\n\n(b) failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to Claimant\u2019s investment;\n\n(c) failed to provide to Claimant\u2019s investment the most constant protection and security;\n\n(d) subjected Claimant\u2019s investment to unreasonable measures;\n\n(e) breached contracts with PCL; and\n\n(f) subjected Claimant\u2019s investment to measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation.\n\n152.\n\nClaimant submits that, as a result of the expropriation of its investment, and in accordance with Article 13(1) of the ECT, it is entitled to full compensation in the form of fair market value of the shares of Nova Plama at the time immediately before the expropriation calculated using the Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") method (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, para. 341). The same compensation should be granted for the other breaches committed by Bulgaria because the nature of the breaches has caused long-term losses to the Claimant as investor.\n\n153.\n\nOn the basis of the DCF method, Claimant\u2019s expert values PCL\u2019s losses in the amount of USD 122,258,000. Accordingly, Claimant\u2019s request for relief in its Memorial on the Merits (para. 347) reads:\n\n*(a) an order that Bulgaria pay PCL compensation for losses suffered as a result of the expropriation of its investment in the amount of USD122,258,000;*\n\n*(b) an order that Bulgaria pay PCL compound interest on such compensation at a commercial rate from December 15, 1999 until the date of payment;*\n\n*(c) in the alternative, an order that Bulgaria pay PCL (i) compensation for losses suffered as a result of the Other ECT Breaches, in the amount of USD122,258,000 and compound* *interest on the compensation awarded at a commercial rate established from December 15, 1999 until the date of payment;*\n\n*(d) an order that Bulgaria pay PCL \u2019s costs occasioned by this arbitration, including the arbitrators\u2019 fees and administrative costs fixed by ICSID, the expenses of the arbitrators, the fees and expenses of its experts, and the legal costs incurred by the parties (including fees of counsel); and*\n\n*(e) any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.*\n\n154.\n\nIn its Reply, Claimant supplements its initial request and indicates that, if the Tribunal were to find that the principles of compensation provided in Article 13(1) - full market value of the Investment immediately before the measures -are not applicable to Claimant\u2019s claims on expropriation and the violation of the other ECT standards, Claimant should be compensated according to established principles of customary international law as restated in the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility (Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits, paras. 214, 217).\n\n155.\n\nAccordingly, Claimant alleges its right to recover *damnum emergens* and *lucrum cessans* and reformulates its request for relief from the Arbitral Tribunal in the following terms:\n\n*(a) to confirm that it has jurisdiction to entertain the claim as submitted by PCL and that such claims are admissible;*\n\n*(b) to order the Republic of Bulgaria to indemnify Claimant in the amount of US$ 122,258,000 representing the fair market value of its investment in the Plama Refinery;*\n\n*(c) subsidiarily, to order the Republic of Bulgaria to pay Claimant an amount of US$13,862,152 for its losses, outlays, unpaid loans, financings and expenses relating to its investment in the Plama Refinery, all of which have been lost due to Bulgaria \u2019s actions, together with compensation in the amount of US$ 10,000,000* *representing its loss of a chance or opportunity of making a commercial success of the project.*\n\n*(d) to award compound interest at a commercial rate on all sums awarded pursuant to b) and/or c) above from 15 December 1999 through the date of award and until such award is effectively paid in full;*\n\n*(e) to declare that all costs of this arbitral proceeding, including legal fees, are to be borne by the Republic of Bulgaria; and*\n\n*(f) to grant Claimant such other relief as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate.*\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n156.\n\nRespondent denies all of Claimant\u2019s claims. It contends that the Refinery\u2019s difficulties derived from factors not attributable to the Republic of Bulgaria, in particular, from the combination of Nova Plama\u2019s high costs structure and the very difficult market conditions (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 70, 530).\n\n157.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s view that it did not engage in unlawful acts and omissions. In particular, Respondent contends:\n\n(a) *Environmental Damages:* Claimant mischaracterizes not only the state of Bulgarian environmental law that was applicable when it acquired Nova Plama but also the terms of the First Privatization Agreement and of the 1999 amendment to the environmental law (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 72);\n\n(b) *Actions of the Syndics:* the syndic\u2019s actions are not legally attributable to the State and, in any event, Claimant has failed to demonstrate in what manner the syndics acted contrary to law or otherwise improperly and in a manner that caused any harm to Claimant (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 72);\n\n(c) *Paper Profits',* the ECT Contracting States do not accept obligations under Article 10 of the ECT with regard to taxation and, in any event, the Bulgarian tax code and accounting rules were transparent and accessible to Claimant; and it had no basis to expect that it would receive some sort of exemption or special treatment (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 285, 308-309);\n\n(d) *Varna Port',* the Varna Port is not \"exclusive state property\" and Claimant never had any legitimate or reasonable expectation that it would remain in the possession of the State; and its privatization was lawful (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 311); and\n\n(e) *Biochim Bank'.* Biochim Bank acted in a commercially predictable and reasonable manner in all its dealings with Nova Plama and did not breach any contractual obligations (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 360).\n\n158.\n\nConsequently, Respondent alleges that it has not breached its obligations under the ECT, nor did the alleged breaches of Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT cause Claimant to lose the value of its investment in Nova Plama\u2019s shares. It is Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimant is not entitled to any compensation because (Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 320):\n\n*(a) Claimant failed to establish a causal connection between Bulgaria \u2019s conduct and the failure of its investment; [footnote omitted]*\n\n*(b) Claimant failed to particularize and quantify its alleged loses; [footnote omitted]*\n\n*(c) Claimant\u2019s use of the DCF method of valuation is inappropriate because Plama has no relevant history of profitability as its cash flows for years were all negative; [footnote omitted]*\n\n*(d) Even if one were to accept a valuation of Claimant\u2019s investment on the basis of the DCF method, Claimant\u2019s* *valuation of Plama is flawed in numerous material respects; [footnote omitted]*\n\n*(e) Plama was not a money-making enterprise [footnote omitted].*\n\n159.\n\nFinally, Claimant failed to support its alternative claim for compensation on the basis of Claimant\u2019s alleged expenses and expenditures or its claim for compensation in the amount of USD 10,000,000 for its alleged loss of chance to make Nova Plama a profitable enterprise (Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 320-321).\n\n160.\n\nConsequently, Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety and order Claimant to bear all costs incurred by Bulgaria in connection with this arbitration (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 575).\n\n**B. The ECT Protections Invoked by Claimant**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nClaimant\u2019s allegations refer to violations of the protections provided in Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT. Whilst Article 13 contains a standard provision on expropriation - including the condition that the expropriation be lawful and that compensation be prompt, adequate and effective, amounting to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated - Article 10(1) contains a complex provision that refers equally to the obligation to create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for making the Investment and to the standards of fair and equitable treatment, constant protection and security, the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory measures and the observance of obligations entered into with an Investor or an Investment.\n\n162.\n\nProfessor Schreuer has pointed out the interaction of the standards of protection, in particular under Article 10 of the ECT, and notes that the tribunal in *Petrobart v. The Kyrgyz Republic**,* a case decided under the ECT, opted for subsuming all standards under the purview of fair and equitable treatment.25\n\nThe tribunal noted: *\"The Arbitral Tribunal does not find it necessary to analyse the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s action in relation to the various specific elements in Article 10(1) of the Treaty but notes that this paragraph in its entirety is intended to ensure a fair and equitable treatment of investments,'\"* *Petrobart*\u00a0*v.* *The Kyrgyz Republic,*Award of 29 March 2005. See also C.H. Schreuer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET): Interaction with other Standards,* Transnational Dispute Management, Vol. 4, issue 5, September 2007, p. 1.\n\n163.\n\nThis Tribunal is also of the view that the standards of protection of Article 10(1) are closely interrelated. This interrelation will surface when analyzing the Parties\u2019 factual allegations. It does not mean, however, that each standard could not be defined autonomously. As noted by Professor Schreuer:\n\n*[...] FET is connected to other standards of protection in a variety of ways. It has points of contact to the standards of \u2018constant protection and security\u2019 and protection against unreasonable or discriminatory measures \u2019. Some tribunals have even found it unnecessary to distinguish these two standards from FET. The better view is that these standards, though related, are separate and autonomous. In fact, some tribunals have given them their own specific meaning.26*\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *op.cit.,* pp. 25-26.\n\n164.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will therefore attempt to provide a relevant definition of the standards, taking into account practice under the ECT and the practice of tribunals under other investment treaties. It will also apply the rules of interpretation delineated by the Chairman\u2019s statement at the adoption session of the ECT on 17 December 1994, quoted at paragraph 139. The Tribunal will also apply the rules provided in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and, in particular, the ECT will be \"[...] *interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"27*\n\nSee Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and Energy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Document. A Legal Framework for International Energy Cooperation,* Chairman\u2019s Statement at Adoption Session on 17 December 1994, p. 158.\n\n165.\n\nAs noted by both Parties, Article 2 of the ECT states that the purpose of the Treaty is to establish \"a *legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.\"* Claimant alleges that these objectives and principles of the Treaty include the creation of *\"a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and to the flow of investments and technologies by implementing market principles in the fields of energy.\"28* Consequently, Claimant concludes that the overall aim of the ECT should be considered as one of favoring the protection of foreign investments.\n\nEuropean Energy Charter, Title I - Objectives. Cited by Claimant in its Memorial on the Merits, para. 245.\n\n166.\n\nRespondent, for its part, cites the guide to the Energy Charter and the Concluding Document of the Elague Conference on the European Energy Charter to explain that the aim of the ECT is not just the promotion of Investments but also the promotion of the economic development of the Contracting States (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 430431).\n\n167.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that a balanced interpretation which takes into account the totality of the Treaty\u2019s purpose is appropriate. In the words of the tribunal in *El Paso Energy International Co.* v. *Argentina**:*\n\n*This Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State sovereignty and the State\u2019s responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.*\n\n**1. Protections provided in Article 10(1)**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal is therefore the text of Article 10(1) of the ECT:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.* *Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting* *Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or* *discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party. [Footnotes omitted]*\n\n**1.1 Stable, Equitable, Favorable and Transparent Conditions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nOnly in its Reply does Claimant introduce the claim that Respondent failed to create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions. Claimant limited its arguments to claiming that it was constantly subjected to *\"haphazard and opaque\"* decisions by Respondent and that repeated *\"interventions\"* created *\"unstable, inequitable, unfavorable and non-* *transparent conditions\"* for PCL\u2019s investment. Claimant was a victim of *\"chronic features of unpredictability and inconsistency.\"*\n\n170.\n\nClaimant did not, however, set out the content of this standard or to explain precisely how it has been violated. The only specific reference in this regard is that the amendment of the Environmental Law allegedly created unstable and inequitable conditions (Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits, para. 178). As noted by Respondent in its Rejoinder on the Merits, Claimant later used the language of the first part of Article 10(1) with respect to the Paper Profit and Varna Port claims.\n\n171.\n\nIn addition, Respondent alleges that, since the obligation of the Contracting Parties in the first sentence of Article 10(1) is to create conditions *\"to make Investments in its Area\",* it applies only to pre-investment matters or, at most, to the circumstances prevailing when the Investor makes its Investment. In any event, contends Respondent, it did not fail to comply with this standard.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the second sentence of Article 10(1) indicates that the conditions listed in the first sentence *\"shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment* and the next sentence links these Investments to the remainder of the protections of this Article. The application of the conditions of the first sentence of Article 10(1) extends in this way to all stages of the Investment and not only to the pre-investment matters.\n\n173.\n\nIn addition, the conditions are dependent on their accordance with the other standards. For instance, stable and equitable conditions are clearly part of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT.\n\n174.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will assess the compliance with these conditions in connection with the other standards analyzed below.\n\n**1.2 Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree that, despite the succinct wording of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, arbitral awards published in the past few years have contributed to providing some guidance to ascertain the content of this standard. The Parties agree that the standard includes to a certain extent the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations and the provision of a stable legal framework (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paras. 251-252; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 436). The Arbitral Tribunal is nonetheless conscious that this may now be a controversial area, particularly with different interpretations being given to the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *MTD* v *Chile**29* However, in the Tribunal's view, the present case can be decided on the facts, whatever interpretation is made of the FET standard in the ECT. Accordingly, for the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal has assumed the interpretation most favorable to the Claimant, as follows.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S. A.* v. *Republic of Chile,* Award of 25 May 2004, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 (\"MTD\"); *ad hoc* Committee Decision on Annulment of 21 March 2007.\n\n176.\n\nWith regard to the protection of legitimate expectations, the Tribunal observes that these include the *\"reasonable and justifiable\"30* expectations that were taken into account by the foreign Investor to make the Investment.31 These should, therefore, include the conditions that were specifically offered by the State to the Investor when making the Investment and that were relied upon by the Investor to make its Investment.32 These expectations would equally include *\"the observation by the host State of such well-established fundamental standards as good faith, due process, and non-discrimination.\"33*\n\n*Thunderbird v. The United Mexican States,* Award of 26 January 2006, UNCITRAL-NAFTA, para. 147 (\"Thunderbird\").\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A.* v. *The United Mexican States,* Award of 29 May 2003, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, para. 154 (\"Tecmed\"); *MTD,* para. 114; *Occidental Exploration and Production Company (OEPC)* v. *The Republic of Ecuador,* Final Award of 1 July 2004, LCIA Case No. UN3467, UNCITRAL, para. 185; *Eureko B.V.* v. *Republic of Poland,* Partial Award of 19 August 2005, para. 235; *LG&E* v. *Argentine Republic,* Decision on Liability of 25 July 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, para. 127 (\"LG&E\").\n\n*CME Czech Republic B. V* v. *The Czech Republic,* Partial Award of 13 September 2001, UNCITRAL, para. 611 (\"CME\"); *Tecmed,* para. 154; *Thunderbird,* para. 147; *LG&E,* para. 127.\n\n*Saluka,* para. 303.\n\n177.\n\nThe stability of the legal framework has been identified as *\"an emerging standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law.\"34* However, the State maintains its legitimate right to regulate, and this right should also be considered when assessing the compliance with the standard of fair and equitable treatment. The tribunal in the *CMS v. Argentina* case explained the situation in the following terms:\n\n*It is not a question of whether the legal framework might need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be adapted to changing circumstances, but neither is it a question of whether the* *framework can be dispensed with altogether when specific commitments to the contrary have been made. The law of foreign investment and its protection has been developed with the specific objective of avoiding such adverse legal effects.35*\n\n*LG&E,* para. 125.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *The Argentine Republic,* Award of 12 May 2005, ICSID Case No. AR/O1/8, para. 277 (\"CMS\").\n\n178.\n\nFinally the Tribunal observes that the condition of transparency, stated in the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT, can be related to the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Transparency appears to be a significant element for the protection of both the legitimate expectations of the Investor and the stability of the legal framework.\n\n**1.3 Constant Protection and Security**\n----------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT also requires the host State to provide to the Investor\u2019s Investment *\"the most constant protection and security.\"* The Parties are in agreement that this standard imposes an obligation of \"due diligence\" (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paras. 277, 286; Respondent\u2019s CounterMemorial on the Merits, para. 466). As noted by the tribunal in *AMT v. Zaire,* later quoted by the tribunals in *Wena* v. *Egypt* and *Saluka v. Czech Republic:*\n\n*The obligation incumbent on the [host State] is an obligation of vigilance, in the sense that the [host State] shall take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of protection and security of its investments an should not be permitted to invoke its own legislation to detract from any such obligation.36*\n\n*American Manufacturing & Trading* v. *Republic of Zaire,* Award of 21 February 1997, ICSID Case No. AR/93/1, para. 28; *Wena Hotel Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* Award on the Merits of 8 December 2000, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, para. 84; *Saluka,* para. 484.\n\n180.\n\nThe standard includes, in this manner, an obligation actively to create a framework that grants security. Although the standard has been developed in the context of physical security, some tribunals have also included protection concerning legal security. In this last respect, the standard becomes closely connected with the notion of fair and equitable treatment.37\n\nSchreuer, *op. cit.,* p. 4.\n\n181.\n\nFinally, this Tribunal observes that the standard is not absolute and does not imply strict liability of the host State. As noted by the tribunal in *Tecmed* and later quoted by the tribunal in *Saluka* *\"... the guarantee of full protection and security is not absolute and does not impose strict liability upon the State that grants it.\"38*\n\n*Tecmed,* para. 177; Saluka,para. 484.\n\n**1.4 Unreasonable and Discriminatory Measures**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe host State must also, under Article 10(1) of the ECT, refrain from subjecting the Investor\u2019s Investment to *\"unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\"* In its Memorial on the Merits, Claimant contends that Respondent\u2019s conduct was *\"unreasonable\"* and makes no reference to the existence of discriminatory treatment. However, in its Reply, Claimant introduces the allegation that Respondent has engaged in discriminatory practices in favor of Neftochim, a direct competitor of PCL.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, on a number of occasions, tribunals in investment arbitrations have found a strong correlation between this standard and the fair and equitable treatment standard. For instance, the tribunal in Saluka noted that:\n\n*The standard of \"reasonableness\" has no different meaning in this context than in the context of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard with which it is associated; and the same is true with regard to the standard of \"non-discrimination\".* *The standard of \"reasonableness\" therefore requires, in this context as well, a showing that the State\u2019s conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy, whereas the* *standard of \"non-discrimination\" requires a rational justification of any differential treatment of a foreign investor.39*\n\n*Saluka,* para. 460. Other arbitration tribunals have taken a similar position merging this standard and the notion of fair and equitable treatment. As noted by Professor Schreuer, in the context of NAFTA this position could be explained by the fact that there is not a separate provision on the prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory treatment. Schreuer, *op.cit.,* p. 5. See, *e.g., S.D. Myers* v. *Canada,* Award on Liability of 13 Nov. 2000, 8 ICSID Reports 18, para. 263; *Waste Management, Inc.* v. *United Mexican States,* Award, 30 April 2004, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, para. 98. Tribunals deciding cases under other investment treaties that have taken a similar position include *CMS,* para. 290; *Impregilo* v. *Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 22 April 2005, ICSID Case No. ARB /02/2, paras. 264-270; *MTD,* para. 196.\n\n184.\n\nHowever, this Tribunal believes that, while the standards can overlap on certain issues, they can also be defined separately. Unreasonable or arbitrary measures - as they are sometimes referred to in other investment instruments -are those which are not founded in reason or fact but on caprice, prejudice or personal preference.40 With regard to discrimination, it corresponds to the negative formulation of the principle of equality of treatment. It entails like persons being treated in a different manner in similar circumstances without reasonable or justifiable grounds.41\n\nSee *Ronald Lauder v. The Czech Republic,* Final Award of 3 September 2001,UNCITRAL, paras. 221,222,232; Schreuer, *op.cit.* pp. 8-9.\n\nSee A.F.M. Maniruzzaman, *Expropriation of Alien Property and the Principle of Non-Discrimination in International Law of Foreign Investment: An Overview,* 8 J. Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 8:1 (1998).\n\n**1.5 Obligations Undertaken Towards Investors**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe last sentence of Article 10(1) mandates the host State to observe any obligations it has entered into with the Investor or an Investment of an Investor and is described by Claimant as an *\"umbrella clause\".*\n\n186.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal can limit itself to noting that the wording of this clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT is wide in scope since it refers to *\"any obligation.\"* An analysis of the ordinary meaning of the term suggests that it refers to any obligation regardless of its nature, *i.e.,* whether it be contractual or statutory.42 However, the *ad hoc* Committee that decided the annulment in the case, *CMS* v. *Argentina**,* commented that the use of the expression *\"entered into\"* should be interpreted as concerning only consensual obligations.43 In any case, these obligations must be assumed by the host State with an Investor.44\n\n*Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets L.P.* v. *Argentine Republic,* Award of 22 May 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, para. 274.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina,* Annulment Decision of 25 September 2007, para. 95.\n\n*Impregilo* v. *Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 22 April 2005, paras 214-216.\n\n187.\n\nFollowing either the wide interpretation of the clause or the more restricted one proposed by the *ad hoc* Committee, contractual obligations are covered by the last sentence of Article 10(1) ECT. Since the Parties are exclusively concerned with the application of the last sentence of Article 10(1) ECT to this type of obligation, the Tribunal need not extend its analysis any further.\n\n**2. Protections Provided in Article 13**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe relevant part of Article 13 of the ECT reads as follows:\n\n*Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is:*\n\n*(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;*\n\n*(b) not discriminatory;*\n\n*(c) carried out under due process of law; and*\n\n*(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the \"Valuation Date\").*\n\n189.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement in identifying the main elements of this provision. In fact, Respondent acknowledged in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits that it did not dispute that *\"Article 13(1) of the ECT states an obligation as to expropriation, or the general propositions that expropriation may be indirect; accomplished by omissions as well as by actions; and measured by means of the effect upon the investment [...] that any determination as to whether an expropriation has occurred must be made by reference to the specific facts of an individual case, and [...] the claimed loss of the value of the investment must be due to the actions of the* State.\" (footnotes omitted) (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 505)\n\n190.\n\nClaimant\u2019s claims refer to the existence of indirect expropriation, *i.e.,* its claims do not relate to the physical taking of the property but to the impact that the State\u2019s conduct had on the enjoyment and value of its investment.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it is widely acknowledged that expropriation can result from State conduct that does not amount to physical control or loss of title but that adversely affects the economic use, enjoyment and value of the investment. This approach was adopted by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in the *Starret Housing Corp* v. *Iran*\u00a0case in the following terms:\n\n[I]t *is recognized by international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated even though the state does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner.45*\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation* v. *Islamic Republic of Iran,* Case No. 24, Interlocutory Award No. ITL 32-24-1, 19 December 1983, 4 Iran-US CTR 122, p.154.\n\n192.\n\nThis position has been reiterated by a number of subsequent arbitral tribunals. In the *Tecmed v. Mexico* arbitration, the tribunal stated:\n\n*... it is understood that the measures adopted by a State, whether regulatory or not, are an indirect de facto expropriation if they are irreversible and permanent and if the assets or rights subject to such measure have been affected in such a way that \"... any form of exploitation thereof...\" has* *disappeared; i.e. the economic value of the use, enjoyment or disposition of the assets or rights affected by the administrative action or decision have been neutralized or destroyed...* *Under international law, the owner is also deprived of property where the use or enjoyment of benefits related thereto is exacted or interfered with to a similar extent, even where legal ownership over the assets in question is not affected, and so long as the deprivation is not temporary.

Analysis of the Alleged Violations**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Environmental Damages**\n----------------------------\n\n**1.1 The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nClaimant contends that, by holding Nova Plama liable for environmental damage caused at the plant site prior to its acquisition by Claimant, Bulgaria breached its obligations under Article 10 of the ECT. It did so by failing to accord to PCL\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment, failing to provide it the most constant protection and security, impairing by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of PCL\u2019s investment and by failing to observe obligations Bulgaria had entered into with PCL. Claimant bases this claim essentially on the alleged breaches by Bulgaria of the provisions of the Second Privatisation Agreement and on the provisions of the Bulgarian environmental law which were amended in 1999, after PCL\u2019s acquisition of Nova Plama.\n\n195.\n\nClaimant also alleges that Bulgaria violated Article 13 of the ECT because the unlawful amendment of the environmental law resulted in its inability to secure financing for the Refinery. As a consequence, it was forced to shut the Refinery down in December 1999 and was prevented from enjoying any economic benefit from its investment (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paras. 332-334).\n\n196.\n\nAt the time of the Second Privatization agreement, the Bulgarian law on the environment read, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n*In case of restitution, privatization or investment in new construction facilities by foreign and Bulgarian natural and legal persons, such persons shall not be liable for* *environnemental damages resulting from past actions or omissions.48*\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant called this provision \"poorly drafted\" (para. 49) and as not expressly providing that the Bulgarian State would be liable for environmental damage incurred during the period that the Bulgarian State had owned the polluting enterprise (para. 50).\n\n197.\n\nThe Second Privatisation Agreement (Article 4) provided that:\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited shall ensure the maintenance of the required level of the environmental conditions related to the activities of the company in accordance with the provisions of the Bulgarian law. Plama Consortium shall bear no* *responsibility for any environmental pollution arising prior to the date of signing of this Agreement.\" (R \u2019s Exh. 676)*\n\n198.\n\nClaimant contends that this language - and the existing environmental law -protected it from liability both directly and indirectly *(i.e.,* through Nova Plama\u2019s being held liable for costs which PCL as shareholder would ultimately have to bear) for the estimated 37.4 million BGN pre-acquisition pollution clean-up costs with respect to Nova Plama.\n\n199.\n\nIn February 1999, shortly after PCL\u2019s acquisition of the Nova Plama shares in November 1998, the Environmental Protection Act was amended49 so as to provide, in Section 9(1), that:\n\n*In the event of privatisation, with the exception of privatisation agreements concluded prior to 1 February 1999, or in case of restitution, or in the event of investment in new construction facilities by foreign and Bulgarian natural and legal persons, the liability for any environmental damages resulting from past actions or omissions shall be borne by the State under such terms and procedures as set forth by the Council of Ministers.*\n\nThe amendment entered into force on 16 February 1999 (Declaration of Denev, para. 58; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 51).\n\n200.\n\nPCL claims that it understood the language of Article 5.1 of the Second Privatization Agreement and the Bulgarian environmental law in force at the time to mean that it - and the company whose shares it was acquiring, Nova Plama - would not be responsible to pay for the clean-up of past environmental damage. It believed that the State would assume such liability, especially since the pollution had occurred during the period when Nova Plama was a State-owned enterprise.\n\n201.\n\nClaimant refers, in this respect, to the Neftochim Information Memorandum, dated 11 February 1999 (R\u2019s Exh. 811, p. 90), in other words before the above amendment entered into effect, which states that *\"according to applicable law, the Bulgarian Government is responsible for funding the environmental remediation programme\".* It cites this as evidence that the Bulgarian environmental law in force even *prior to* the 16 February 1999 amendment and, therefore, at the time of Nova Plama\u2019s second privatization, placed responsibility for past environmental damage on the State. However, as Respondent explains in its Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits, at paragraph 51, the amendment to the environmental law explicitly placing such responsibility on the State was adopted by the Parliament on 29 January 1999 and, although it only entered into force on 16 February 1999, provided for an effective date of 1 February 1999; thus, the Neftochim Information Memorandum referred to the law as amended, not as it stood in 1998. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts this explanation.\n\n202.\n\nPCL\u2019s understanding of past environmental damage finds expression in the Recovery Plan which was adopted pursuant to the Privatization Agreement. At the end of the Recovery Plan, in Section 7, after referring to the issue of cleaning up past environmental damage, it is stated that \"[t]he *Bulgarian Government has taken into consideration this fact and has released the new owners*  *(including Plama AD)* *of any responsibility for environmental pollution having arisen prior to the date of signing the Privatization Contract, i.e. 17 November 1998.\"* (Underlining added. See R\u2019s Exh. 609.)\n\n203.\n\nClaimant contends that, by adopting amendments to its environmental law that would hold the State of Bulgaria responsible only for past ecological damage with respect to privatizations occurring *after* 1 February 1999 - and, therefore, not to the privatization of Nova Plama which occurred in 1998 - Bulgaria changed its law to the detriment of Claimant and Nova Plama and breached the contractual obligations to PCL as set out in the Second Privatisation Agreement. This was, in turn, a clear violation of the final sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n204.\n\nClaimant also cites a letter of 14 June 2002 (C\u2019s Exh. 383) from the Bulgarian Minister of Finance to Nova Plama, threatening to reopen the insolvency proceedings against Nova Plama unless it, among other things, undertook its obligation to clean up the pollution at the Refinery, thereby illegally attempting to force Nova Plama to assume liabilities of which it had been contractually absolved.\n\n205.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s case that, as a consequence of this change in the law, Nova Plama became liable for past environmental damage at the Refinery -evaluated by it at 31.4 million BGN - and that the burden of such a financial liability rendered it incapable of raising the necessary financing to resume production at the Plama Refinery.\n\n206.\n\nClaimant further asserts that, by adopting the February 1999 amendment to apply prospectively only, Respondent acted in a discriminatory way *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimant and Nova Plama by comparison with the treatment accorded to Nova Plama\u2019s competitor, Neftochim, another Bulgarian oil Refinery which was privatized in October 1999 and which, by virtue of the 1999 amendment to the environmental law, was exonerated from responsibility for past environmental damage. This discriminatory treatment violated Respondent\u2019s obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n207.\n\nRespondent contends that, while the language of Article 5.1 of the Privatization Agreement provides to the investor, PCL, immunity from liability for past environmental damage, it does not remove responsibility from the acquired company, Nova Plama. The law in force at the time of the Second Privatization Agreement was no different concerning this issue, as seen from the text quoted above (para. 196 *supra).* Nothing in the law or in the agreement made the State liable for past pollution.\n\n208.\n\nRespondent denies that it committed any breach of its obligations under the ECT to PCL. It contends that Bulgaria\u2019s actions *vis-\u00e0-vis* Nova Plama concerning the environment at the Refinery site were not aimed at imposing onerous liability for remediation of past environmental damage but rather at ensuring that Nova Plama would take the necessary measures to operate the Refinery in a manner compliant with existing regulations. It cites a 1998 information letter (R\u2019s Exh. 528; C\u2019s Exh. 189) addressed by the Bulgarian Regional Inspectorate to the effect that Nova Plama had no outstanding unpaid sanctions or fines and summarizing pending steps to bring the Refinery\u2019s operations into compliance with environmental regulations. In fact, Respondent asserts that there is no evidence that Nova Plama was ever subject to any sanction by Bulgaria in connection with alleged past environmental damages (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 119).\n\n209.\n\nRespondent contests the reliability of an expert report prepared for Nova Plama in 1999 (the so-called \"Control P. Report\" - R\u2019s Exh. 521) as an assessment of the measure of past environmental damage. It is upon this report that Claimant relies to determine its estimate of the cost of remediation of past environmental damage. Respondent contends that the Control P. Report is not consistent with the established methodology for assessing the existence of damages actually requiring remediation and that it does not properly assess the costs of any such remediation. It contends that the report fails to distinguish between remediation of past environmental damages and measures regarding compliance with current regulations for re-establishing refinery operations and does not set out reliable costs estimates for the measures it advises should be taken (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 130 *et seq.).*\n\n210.\n\nRespondent also says that Claimant has not proven any detrimental consequences to itself or to Nova Plama due to liability for past environmental damage. It has not been fined, sanctioned or harmed. Nor, asserts Respondent, does the evidence submitted by Claimant prove that it was unable to obtain financing or insurance due to outstanding environmental liabilities. Respondent adds that Nova Plama benefitted from the sale of liquid waste, which reduced its environmental remediation costs.\n\n211.\n\nAs regards the Second Privatization Agreement, Respondent says that it is clear from the language of the Agreement that, while the investor - PCL -would not be held liable for past environmental damage, nothing is said regarding the liability of the target of the investment, Nova Plama. Under the Bulgarian environmental legislation in force at the time of Nova Plama\u2019s privatization (both in 1996 and 1998), Nova Plama remained liable for past environmental damage and, according to Respondent, that fact must have been taken into account in negotiating the terms of Claimant\u2019s purchase of Nova Plama\u2019s shares. Respondent contends that the fact that, prior to Nova Plama\u2019s privatization, the State owned and controlled the Refinery did not, under the law in force during that time, mean that the State was responsible for environmental damage; rather, the liability, under the law, remained with Nova Plama. Respondent denies that the 1999 amendment of the environmental law discriminated against Claimant and asserts that Claimant and the investor in Neftochim were not in similar circumstances.\n\n**1.2 The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not find the evidence and arguments very clear-cut. It seems not unreasonable for PCL to have understood from the text of Article 4 of the Second Privatization Agreement that neither it nor the company it was acquiring would be held liable for cleaning up past environmental damage. After all, where would a bankrupt company, which Nova Plama was at the time of its acquisition by PCL, obtain the money to clean up past pollution if not from its shareholders(s)? In that case, the exemption of PCL alone from liability for past pollution was a hollow provision. This view finds support in a letter from the Ministry of Economy to Nova Plama dated 8 July 2002 (R\u2019s Exh. 465) in which the Ministry states, \"... *the Ministry of Economy deems valid the text of the agreement signed by Plama Consortium Ltd and the Privatization Agency on 17.11.1998 (the Second Privatization Agreement), i.e., we think that Nova Plama AD should not have to bear material responsibility for cleaning out the past ecological damages.\"*\n\n213.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Vautrin, in his Fourth Witness Statement, said that obtaining a specific provision in the privatization agreement by which the State accepted liability for past environmental damage was a fundamental condition for him to purchase Nova Plama\u2019s shares (see para. 37). Yet, one searches in vain for such an explicit exemption in the Second Privatization Agreement. Such an exemption might have been obtained in negotiation; but no evidence was given as to whether an effort was actually made to procure it. Respondent has submitted evidence of other privatizations in which investor and privatized company were exempted from liability for past environmental damage and in which State responsibility for pre-privatization environmental damage was explicitly provided for (R\u2019s Exhs. 701 and 702). If it is correct, as Claimant\u2019s Counsel implied during the hearing in January-February 2008 (H. Tr. Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 49), that Bulgaria changed its environmental law in 1999 in order to protect Neftochim from liability for past environmental damage as part of that company\u2019s privatization, how do we know that the Government would not have done the same for Nova Plama had Claimant bargained for it? Respondent asserts that the price paid for Nova Plama\u2019s shares reflected (or should have reflected) all known liabilities, past, present and future and that the state of environmental pollution at Nova Plama was known to all parties. No evidence was given on these aspects of the negotiations.\n\n214.\n\nRespondent has contended that, if the assumption of State liability for past environmental damage adopted in February 1999 had been made retroactive beyond 1 February 1999, it would have had to extend such liability to a prohibitive number of other Bulgarian companies (see, *e.g.,* R\u2019s Exh. 452). However, when one looks at other evidence in the record, for example the World Bank\u2019s Implementation Report (C\u2019s Exh. 187), it appears that many of the very companies cited by Respondent as being those to which State aid for past environmental damage would have had to be extended if the February 1999 legislation had been retroactive, were in fact beneficiaries of such aid.\n\n215.\n\nAnother element which renders the issue of past environmental damage unclear is Section 7 of the Recovery Plan (R\u2019s Exh. 609), drafted essentially by Claimant, which states that the Government of Bulgaria excused PCL *\"{including Plama AD)\"* from paying for past environmental damage. If PCL really believed what it wrote in the Recovery Plan, why did it have to enter a reserve in Nova Plama\u2019s books for such damage? Moreover, there is other evidence indicating that Nova Plama did not have any significant past environmental damage to clean up (R\u2019s Exhs. 526 and 727, Appendix 3, page 8).50\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is, of course, mindful of the Control P Report which assesses the Refinery\u2019s environmental status.\n\n216.\n\nYet, there are elements in the record which seem to indicate the contrary of what is said in Section 7 of the Recovery Plan. Thus, for example, a note to PCL\u2019s 1999 Financial Statements stating that, by virtue of the 1999 amendment of the environmental law, Nova Plama is liable for past ecological damages caused in the period when the State was Nova Plama\u2019s sole owner (C\u2019s Exh. 203, p. 13, Section 6), as well as a note from Nova Plama\u2019s Chief Ecologist to Syndic Todorova also addressing the Refinery\u2019s liability for past pollution (C\u2019s Exh. 186, p. 2). There exists also a letter from Minister Vassilev to Mr. Vautrin, dated 14 June 2002 (R\u2019s Exh. 463), demanding that Nova Plama *\"shoulder the expenses for cleaning out all environmental pollutions resulting from the Refinery\u2019s work.\"*\n\n217.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal comes to the question of whether there is any element in this confusing situation which establishes a violation by Bulgaria of its obligations under the ECT.\n\n218.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds no evidence that the modification of Bulgaria\u2019s environmental law in 1999 was aimed directly against Claimant and its investment in Nova Plama or in favor of Neftochim. That modification, implemented pursuant to recommendations made by the World Bank, is seen by the Arbitral Tribunal rather as an effort by Bulgaria to meet its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT to create favorable conditions for Investors.\n\n219.\n\nIn his legal opinion of 28 October 2005, Mr. Denev says that the 1999 amendment of the environmental law was discriminatory against prior investors and, therefore, unconstitutional. The Arbitral Tribunal cannot opine on the constitutionality of the 1999 amendment. However, the Tribunal believes that the ECT does not protect investors against any and all changes in the host country\u2019s laws. Under the fair and equitable treatment standard the investor is only protected if (at least) reasonable and justifiable expectations were created in that regard. It does not appear that Bulgaria made any promises or other representations to freeze its legislation on environmental law to the Claimant or at all.\n\n220.\n\nMoreover, Bulgaria\u2019s environmental law, as it existed prior to PCL\u2019s acquisition of Nova Plama (quoted earlier), could give no assurance to Claimant that Nova Plama would be exempt from liability for cleaning up past environmental damage. Claimant admits that the Bulgarian law, as it existed at the time of Nova Plama\u2019s second privatization, was, at best, unclear as to liability for past environmental damages (H. Tr. Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 67). Indeed, Mr. Vautrin must have recognized the uncertainty in the law because, as he testified (Fourth Witness Declaration, 28 October 2005, para. 37), State assumption of liability for past environment damage was so essential to him that he insisted on an explicit provision in the privatization agreement, exempting Nova Plama from such liability. This indicates to the Arbitral Tribunal that he was aware that Bulgarian law at the time did *not* protect Nova Plama against liability for past pollution but failed to negotiate the contractual guarantees he believed were necessary to avoid such risk. While Claimant criticizes Bulgaria for the inadequacy of its environmental law in this regard, Claimant was, of course, aware of, or should have been aware of, the state of Bulgarian law when it invested in Nova Plama.\n\n221.\n\nClaimant also complains that, at the same time as the Privatization Agency was negotiating with PCL over the environmental issue in 1998, the proposal to make the State liable for past environmental damages of privatized companies (which became the February 1999 amendment) was being debated in the Bulgarian Parliament without informing PCL of this impending change in the law. But those parliamentary debates were in the public record and should have been known by PCL\u2019s Bulgarian advisors.\n\n222.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot uphold Claimant\u2019s allegations that Respondent violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment by amending its environmental law. It is also unclear how Respondent\u2019s conduct in this context could amount to a violation of the obligation to provide constant protection and security. Even accepting the approach that this standard includes an obligation to provide legal security, the Tribunal has established that Claimant failed fully to appreciate the scope and specificities of Bulgarian legislation. In addition, Claimant failed to identify and the Tribunal was unable to establish a lack of due diligence in Respondent\u2019s treatment of Claimant and its investment with regard to the environmental amendments.\n\n223.\n\nAs to the claim concerning discriminatory treatment, Bulgaria contended that all companies privatized before 1999 were in the same situation as Nova Plama and did not receive aid to clean up past pollution. There is, nevertheless, evidence that, in the implementation of the 1999 amendment, there may have been some companies not covered by the new law which, nevertheless, received State assistance, whereas Nova Plama did not (see para. 206 *supra).* However, insufficient evidence has been given to permit the Arbitral Tribunal to determine that Bulgaria\u2019s treatment of Nova Plama in this respect was discriminatory. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal dismisses Claimant\u2019s allegations in this regard.\n\n224.\n\nWith respect to Claimant\u2019s allegation as to the violation of the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Tribunal finds no violation by Bulgaria of its contractual undertakings to PCL. The amendment of the Environmental Law did not breach Article 4 of the Second Privatization Agreement since this provision did not shift Nova Plama\u2019s liability to the State.\n\n225.\n\nIn addition, the Arbitral Tribunal has examined the evidence to see what harm or loss to Claimant or its investment resulted from Nova Plama\u2019s liability to clean up past pollution, assuming it existed. Claimant\u2019s contention that it could not obtain financing for the project given the large liability for past pollution on its books is not supported by sufficient documentary evidence of a contemporary nature. The only document in the record is a letter from a Swiss insurance company, Intersure, (C\u2019s Exh. 204) saying that it needed *\"confirmation that the outstanding ecological issue has been solved.\"* But such a letter from one insurance company hardly proves that financing was impossible to obtain because of any liability for environmental clean-up. As Counsel for Claimant stated at the January-February 2008 hearing (H. Tr. Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 42), *\"no company or bank would advance money to [Nova Plama] because Plama itself had bad credit.\"*\n\n226.\n\nBulgaria has insisted in submissions that its governmental authorities never sought to enforce the obligation to clean up past pollution on Nova Plama.51 While Claimant, in its Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits (para. 91), asserted that the damage to its investment from liability for past environmental damage is readily quantifiable at USD 23 million, nowhere does it show that it had to pay such amount. There is no evidence of what amounts, if any, Nova Plama actually spent to clean up past environmental damage. In fact, Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits does not refer to PCL\u2019s or Nova Plama\u2019s having had to pay for past environmental damage but rather to the prospect of a demand that they pay (see para. 76). Thus the very basis of Claimant\u2019s claim, summarized in paragraph 194 above, that Bulgaria is guilty of *\"holding Nova Plama liable for environmental damage,\"* is not factually established.\n\nIndeed, two governmental documents, evaluating Nova Plama\u2019s environmental status (R\u2019s Exhs. 526 and 528) do not refer to significant past pollution at the Refinery but more to measures which the Refinery would have to take to bring itself into compliance with current standards.\n\n227.\n\nAbsent any proof of harm or loss to the investment or limitation to Claimant\u2019s right to use or enjoy its investment as a result of Respondent\u2019s conduct with regard to the environmental amendments, it is impossible to see how a claim concerning the expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment could be successful.\n\n228.\n\nTherefore, the Arbitral Tribunal is unable to conclude that Respondent violated its obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT.\n\n**2. Actions of the Syndics**\n-----------------------------\n\n229.\n\nClaimant essentially complains that the syndics appointed to manage Nova Plama while it was in bankruptcy in 1998-1999 failed to fulfil their obligations and took unlawful actions which harmed Nova Plama. It contends that the Bulgarian Government and Courts failed properly to control them, in violation of Respondent\u2019s obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT to afford fair and equitable treatment, the most constant protection and security and to avoid unreasonable measures. Together with other violations, the syndics\u2019 actions amount to an indirect expropriation contrary to Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n**2.1 Irregularities in the Appointment of the Syndics**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nClaimant contends that there were irregularities in the appointment of the syndics and in the retention of Syndic Penev as a supervisory syndic after approval of the Recovery Plan.\n\n**2.2 Unlawful Increases in the Salaries of Nova Plama\u2019s Workers**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nClaimant alleges that, prior to its acquisition of Nova Plama, while Claimant was negotiating an agreement with the workers of Nova Plama regarding payment of back salaries, one of the syndics of Nova Plama, then in insolvency, Syndic Todorova, *ex officio,* and without consulting PCL or Nova Plama, undertook to index workers\u2019 salaries in such a way as to increase the amounts owing to the employees as well as to include in the Company\u2019s receivables payments for taxes, insurance, etc., which were not foreseen. Claimant considers these acts by the syndics, which increased Nova Plama\u2019s financial burden, unlawful, citing a Pleven Regional Prosecution Office\u2019s conclusion that the syndics had caused Nova Plama to suffer damages in the amounts of BGN 1,583,738.553 by unlawful salary indexation and BGN 2,025,313.581 by unlawful acceptance of amounts corresponding to workers\u2019 income tax, social insurance, etc.\n\n**2.3 Overloading of Debt by the Syndics**\n------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nClaimant alleges that the syndics unlawfully accepted as debts of Nova Plama pre-insolvency claims which were either fabricated or inflated, thereby burdening the company\u2019s debts by BGN 40 million. The creditors of these debts were Mineralbank, First Private Bank and the Bank for Agricultural Credit (BAC). According to Claimant, the Pleven District Court approved all the syndics\u2019 actions on 31 May 1999 (C\u2019s Exh. 224).\n\n233.\n\nClaimant also complains that the syndics unlawfully accepted claims against Nova Plama by First Private Bank which were not owing by Nova Plama to the bank but which were, nevertheless, approved by the competent court. Claimant alleges that the two syndics were criminally indicted in 2004 for accepting non-existent debts in the amount of BGN 40,886,453.645.\n\n234.\n\nClaimant says that because, at the time, management of Nova Plama was in the hands of the syndics, and Nova Plama\u2019s management board was not given access to the company\u2019s financial accounts, PCL and Nova Plama had no way of ascertaining whether the claimed receivables were legitimate or not.\n\n**2.4 Misappropriation of Nova Plama\u2019s Funds**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nClaimant further alleges that Syndic Penev misappropriated Nova Plama\u2019s funds and carried out other unlawful actions during the period from May 1999 to October 2000. According to Claimant, Syndic Penev was found guilty by the Pleven Regional Court of criminal action in the course of his duties as syndic of Nova Plama.\n\n**2.5 Worker Riots**\n--------------------\n\n236.\n\nClaimant accuses Syndic Todorova of inciting the workers of Nova Plama to strike and riot unlawfully at the Refinery, of herself participating in these actions, and of using violence to evict the Refinery\u2019s director from his office (which led to the shutdown of the Refinery on 8 April 1999). In this connection, the police, according to Claimant, failed adequately to protect the Refinery and its management. These unlawful actions allegedly paralyzed the production of the Refinery and blocked all movements of products in and out of the Refinery for two and a half months, escalating into anarchy which lasted for many weeks. Despite reporting these events to the Bulgarian Government, Nova Plama received no police assistance to restore order. Claimant contends that these actions and omissions violate Bulgaria\u2019s obligation under Article 10(1) to afford the most constant protection and security to its investment and fall within the scope of Article 12 of the ECT52, entitling it to compensation for losses caused by civil disturbances.\n\nSee text of Article 12 in the Annex to this Award.\n\n**2.6 Parallel Recovery Plan**\n------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nIn its Reply, Claimant alleges that Syndic Todorova unlawfully submitted a parallel recovery plan to that of Claimant\u2019s which delayed the lifting of Nova Plama\u2019s insolvency (Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits, paras. 122-3).\n\n238.\n\nClaimant further complains that Syndic Todorova refused to account for products shipped to and from the Refinery and refused PCL\u2019s request that its own designated financial and accounting representative be on site (Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits, para. 17).\n\n239.\n\nRespondent denies that it bears any responsibility for the actions of the syndics complained of by Claimant and contends that, in any event, the syndics\u2019 actions were in accordance with Bulgarian law in effect at the time. Respondent goes on to rebut Claimant\u2019s arguments as to the appointment of the syndics, as to unlawful salary increases having been given to the workers, as to debt overloading by the syndics, as to misappropriation by Syndic Penev, as to the alleged riot and unlawful strike and Syndic Todorova\u2019s role therein, as to the failure of the police to provide protection to the Refinery and its management and as to the syndics\u2019 submission of a parallel recovery plan. Moreover, the so-called \"riot\", which occurred on 8 April 1999 could not have caused the Refinery shutdown, which began on 5 April 1999 and, therefore, predated this \"riot\".\n\n240.\n\nRespondent\u2019s principal contention is that, under Bulgarian law, a syndic is not an organ of the State and does not perform governmental functions; therefore, his/her actions cannot be imputed to the State. Although a syndic is appointed by a court upon nomination by the creditors, the syndic does not, according to Respondent, perform governmental functions or operate under the direction or control of the State and does not act as an agent of the State or of the court. Therefore, contends Respondent, if Claimant complains about the actions of the syndics, those actions cannot form the basis of claims against Respondent under the ECT.\n\n241.\n\nIn any event, Respondent says, Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the syndics acted contrary to law or otherwise improperly in a manner which caused any harm to Claimant. Nor has Claimant established that the Bulgarian courts took any action or failed to take any action which was improper.\n\n242.\n\nWith respect to Claimant\u2019s contention that the syndics unlawfully accepted pre-insolvency claims against Nova Plama made by BAC, Mineralbank and First Private Bank, Respondent contends that Claimant ratified, at a creditors\u2019 meeting on 22 June 1999, a list of accepted claims containing all claims now challenged by it as well as the Recovery Plan which included such claims. In this connection, Respondent challenges Claimant\u2019s assertion that it had no legal standing to contest any measures in the insolvency proceeding.\n\n243.\n\nRespondent says that, prior to its acquisition of Nova Plama\u2019s shares, Claimant had full knowledge of and unimpeded access to information about the Nova Plama bankruptcy proceedings and all claims admitted therein; that Claimant specifically agreed to the claims it now contests in the Recovery Plan and elsewhere53; that Claimant failed to utilize at the time the remedies available to it under Bulgarian law for contesting the claims in question; and that the syndics\u2019 acceptance of the claims of Mineralbank, BAC and First Private Bank was not unlawful because the claims were supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* R\u2019s Exhs. 142 and 598.\n\n244.\n\nRespondent contends that the syndics\u2019 acceptance of the claims in question did not increase Nova Plama\u2019s debts and had no adverse effect on the Refinery\u2019s net economic condition.\n\n245.\n\nAs to the workers\u2019 \"riot\", Respondent denies that the workers\u2019 protests over not being paid their salaries amounted to a \"riot\" or that Syndic Todorova in any way instigated a \"riot\" by the workers. Respondent adds that the Bulgarian police were constantly present at the Refinery at the time the alleged \"riot\" occurred and provided any necessary protection. In no event, says Respondent, did the events or \"riot\" of 8 April 1999 cause the shutdown of the Refinery. According to Respondent, the shutdown began - on Claimant\u2019s own initiative - on 4 or 5 April 1999.54 Nor, contends Respondent, were the workers\u2019 actions responsible for blocking product from coming into or going out of the Refinery.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counsel appeared to verify Respondent\u2019s argument at the January-February 2008 hearing (H. Tr., Day 5, 1 February 2008, p. 983, lines 20-22 and p. 984, line 1).\n\n246.\n\nRespondent contests Claimant\u2019s argument regarding the parallel recovery plan submitted by Syndic Todorova, saying she had the right under Bulgarian law to submit such a plan.\n\n247.\n\nFinally, Respondent states that the Bulgarian courts, on 13 November 2006, properly acquitted the syndics of criminal charges with the exception of one minor one which had been filed against them (C\u2019s Exh. 241).\n\n**2.7 The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe factual evidence with respect to the actions of the syndics and the alleged riot of the Refinery\u2019s workers is in virtually all respects contradictory. Eyewitnesses to the same events gave conflicting testimony as to what they saw. Thus witnesses presented by Claimant testified that the workers at the Refinery rioted, used violence to evict the Refinery\u2019s director, Mr. Beauduin, from his office, were encouraged and even led in their actions by Syndic Todorova and that the police did nothing to intervene and afford protection to the premises and its management. Respondent\u2019s witnesses testified that the workers gathered to demand payment of their overdue wages, that their demonstration was peaceful, that Syndic Todorova was not seen encouraging or leading the demonstration, that there was no violence and that Mr. Beauduin left his office of his own volition, safely escorted by the police.55\n\nThis version of the facts is supported by Mr. Beauduin\u2019s memorandum dated 8 April 1999, recounting the events of that day (R\u2019s Exh. 840).\n\n249.\n\nGiven this conflicting evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal is unable to form any firm view as to what really transpired. The burden of proof being on Claimant, the Tribunal cannot, therefore, rule in its favor concerning these allegations, including with respect to its claim under Article 12 of the ECT.\n\n250.\n\nAs to Claimant\u2019s arguments that there were irregularities in the appointment of the syndics, that the syndics unlawfully increased the salaries of the workers, that they accepted debts unlawfully and that they improperly submitted a *\"parallel\"* recovery plan, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the evidence shows the contrary (See, *e.g.,* R\u2019s Exh. 1030, a decision from the Pleven Municipal Court acquitting the syndics of criminal charges related to the acceptance of claims in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings). The Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent\u2019s rebuttal of Claimant\u2019s arguments in its Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits (pp. 23 *et seq).*\n\n251.\n\nHowever, in order to determine the responsibility of Respondent under the ECT, the crucial questions for the Arbitral Tribunal are whether the State is legally responsible for the actions of syndics, whether syndics are instruments of the State and perform State functions and whether the Bulgarian courts failed to control or supervise the syndics in a way which gives rise to State responsibility. Here again, the Arbitral Tribunal has before it conflicting experts\u2019 opinions on the role and authority of syndics and the courts in a bankruptcy situation in Bulgaria such as that of Nova Plama.\n\n252.\n\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility of the International Law Commission provides:\n\n*The conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered an act of State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the* *conduct.*\n\n253.\n\nHaving reviewed the experts\u2019 opinions, the evidence presented and the submissions of the Parties on these points, the Arbitral Tribunal has come to the conclusion that syndics in bankruptcy proceedings, such as that involving Nova Plama, are not instruments or organs of the State for whose acts the State is responsible. Although Claimant\u2019s legal expert, Mr. Denev, in his opinion of 28 October 2005 annexed to Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, cites a Bulgarian Supreme Court decision to the effect that a syndic is *\"a court\u2019s authority\"* (see para. 37), the Arbitral Tribunal does not interpret this to mean that a syndic carries out judicial or State functions. Mr. Denev quotes the Commercial Law as defining the syndic as an *\"organ of the estate of insolvency\"* (see para. 36). The opinions of Professor Chipev, dated 16 July 2006 and 19 July 2007, presented by Respondent, seem more persuasive to the Tribunal in concluding that a syndic is not a State organ and accord with the experience of the members of the Tribunal in other civil law countries. Thus the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the acts of the syndics, if they were wrongful - and the Tribunal makes no finding in this respect - are not attributable to Respondent, which cannot, therefore, be said to have violated its obligations towards PCL under the ECT.\n\n254.\n\nAs for Claimant\u2019s allegation that the Bulgarian courts failed adequately to control and supervise the acts of the syndics, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts Mr. Denev\u2019s opinion that the Bulgarian courts had a role in supervising the work of the syndics. Obviously the courts of a State are organs of that State, and the State may bear responsibility for the acts or omissions of its courts. According to the expert opinions of Professor Chipev, presented by Respondent, the powers of supervision and control of the courts over syndics are relatively limited, an opinion which the Arbitral Tribunal accepts. It appears that Claimant and/or Nova Plama had access to the Bulgarian courts to complain of actions of the syndics with which they disagreed. In fact, they did bring certain actions in this respect.56 The Tribunal can find no evidence that such access to the courts was in any way obstructed or that the courts decided the issues presented to them in anything other than a fair way. The Tribunal finds no evidence which would engage the responsibility of Respondent under the ECT.\n\nClaimant made the general allegation that Respondent violated Article 10(12) of the ECT. The Arbitral Tribunal is not persuaded that this is the case.\n\n255.\n\nConsequently, the Arbitral Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s complaints regarding the syndics.\n\n**3. Paper Profits**\n--------------------\n\n**3.1 The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nClaimant contends that, because Bulgaria lacked appropriate accounting rules and tax legislation, the discount or rescheduling of Nova Plama\u2019s debts in its Recovery Plan resulted in artificial profit which became taxable and thus created a new debt for the company, requiring an accounting reserve in its books. As a consequence, Nova Plama was not in a position to finalize its 1999, 2000 and 2001 financial statements and missed the deadline for filing its tax return for the 1999 fiscal year and in subsequent years. This, in turn, created a new tax liability. The result was that,, being unable to show that taxes due had been paid and therefore to present audited financial statements, it was impossible for Nova Plama to obtain the necessary financing to start up the Refinery.\n\n257.\n\nClaimant contends that Bulgaria did not have a proper legal framework for companies which had terminated insolvency proceedings, thereby violating its undertaking in Article \u2019 10(1) of the ECT to create stable, equitable and favorable conditions for Investors. From 1999 to 2001, Claimant says that Nova Plama sought the Government\u2019s approval for various accounting measures which would avoid its having to declare a \"paper profit\" but never received a satisfactory response.\n\n258.\n\nEventually, says Claimant, Bulgaria acknowledged the gap in its legislation and, at the end of 2001, adopted legislation absolving companies of profit tax on such \"paper profits\".\n\n259.\n\nClaimant concludes that, by refusing to assist Nova Plama in finding a solution to the problem of \"paper profits\" and by failing to amend its laws in a timely way regarding the taxation of the paper profit which resulted from the discounted liabilities under the Recovery Plan, Bulgaria violated its obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to accord fair and equitable treatment and the most constant protection and security to Claimant\u2019s investment and to avoid unreasonable measures. It also violated Article 13 of the ECT, because Bulgaria\u2019s conduct in this regard contributed to PCL\u2019s inability to secure financing for the Refinery and resulted in the deprivation of Claimant\u2019s right to the use and enjoyment of the economic benefits of its investment.\n\n260.\n\nRespondent replies that ECT Contracting States do not accept an obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT regarding fair and equitable treatment with respect to tax. It refers to Article 21(1) of the ECT which provides:\n\n*Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency [...]*\n\n261.\n\nIn any event, Respondent contends, Claimant could not have had any legitimate or reasonable expectation that Nova Plama would not be subject to existing tax law, of which it was perfectly well aware when it purchased the company. It was not excused from filing obligatory tax returns or prevented from preparing financial statements; rather than doing so, it chose to lobby for tax relief and for a change in the law. Respondent submits that the various Bulgarian authorities concerned acted reasonably and in good faith to respond to Claimant\u2019s inquiries and that Bulgaria\u2019s tax laws were reasonable and consistent with international standards.\n\n262.\n\nIn fact, according to Respondent, Nova Plama had available to it alternative accounting methods for treating the discounted debts to that which it adopted which would have avoided the problems it encountered (see Transacta Report, paras. 38-39).\n\n263.\n\nRespondent also points out that, in 2001, it did adopt the change to its tax law which Nova Plama sought.\n\n264.\n\nFinally, Respondent says that Claimant has failed to produce evidence that it or Nova Plama made any serious attempts to obtain financing that were rejected because of Nova Plama\u2019s alleged inability to prepare its financial statements and file tax returns. Nor has it proven otherwise that the \"paper profit\" issue caused it any injury.\n\n**3.2 The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe problem of which Claimant here complains is that the discounted debt (which it was able to negotiate with Nova Plama\u2019s creditors) unfairly gave rise under Bulgarian tax law to a \"paper profit\" on which it was liable to pay company income tax. It demanded a modification of Bulgaria\u2019s tax law to eliminate the tax consequences, which it finally obtained in 2001, but until then it was unable, in light of the enormous potential tax liability, to file certified audited financial statements without paying the tax; and this meant it could not obtain financing for the operation of the Refinery.\n\n266.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal cannot see how this claim gives rise to a violation of Bulgaria\u2019s obligations under the ECT. In the first place, Article 21 of the ECT specifically excludes from the scope of the ECT\u2019s protections taxation measures of a Contracting State, with certain exceptions, one of which is that, if a tax constitutes or is alleged to constitute an expropriation or is discriminatory, the Investor must refer the issue to the competent tax authority, which Claimant did not do.\n\n267.\n\nEven putting aside Article 21 of the ECT, the Tribunal finds no action by Respondent which comes anywhere near to being unfair or inequitable treatment or amounting to expropriation. When Claimant purchased the shares of Nova Plama and negotiated its Debt Settlement Agreement, it was or should have been aware of the taxation treatment that would be accorded to debt reduction by Bulgarian law. It could not have had any legitimate expectation that it would be treated otherwise. It had Ernst & Young, one of the world\u2019s leading tax advisory firms, advising it on its acquisition.\n\n268.\n\nIt has been suggested by Respondent and its experts (see Report of Transacta, 28 July 2006, Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits) that Nova Plama could have adopted a method of accounting for its debt reduction under Bulgarian law which would have avoided the tax consequences it complains of. Claimant says that it was not informed at the time. While the members of the Arbitral Tribunal are not experts in Bulgarian accounting or tax law, it is clear to the Tribunal that Claimant, as the investor, was responsible for doing its due diligence regarding the tax consequences of debt reduction and for taking the necessary measures to deal with them.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent produced evidence which shows that the tax laws of many countries around the world treat debt reductions, as were negotiated in this case, as income taxable to the beneficiary (see Report of International Fiscal Association, R\u2019s Exh. 1027). It cannot be said that Bulgaria\u2019s law in this respect was unfair, inadequate, inequitable or discriminatory. It was part of the generally applicable law of the country like that of many other countries.\n\n270.\n\nHere again, as in the case of liability for past environmental damage, discussed earlier in this Award, if Claimant was concerned about the tax consequences of the debt reduction it sought and obtained, it could have attempted to negotiate provisions in the Privatization Agreement protecting Nova Plama against them. There is no evidence that it did so.\n\n271.\n\nThe evidence also shows that Bulgaria did not in fact seek to collect the taxes which were due from Nova Plama.57 On the contrary, there is much evidence in the record which demonstrates the Government of Bulgaria\u2019s efforts to try to assist Claimant and Nova Plama in this respect (C\u2019s Exhs. 273, 275, 282). While in its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant asserts that its damage from the \"hollow\" tax is readily quantifiable at USD 23 million (see para. 91), nowhere does it say that it ever had to pay any such tax. And in the end, in 2001, Bulgaria changed its tax laws to exempt Nova Plama from any taxation on these \"paper profits\". (See Report of Transacta, 28 July 2006, paras. 59 *et seq.-,* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 289-301; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 123-4). In terms of diligence, Bulgaria\u2019s behavior with regard to the above is beyond reproach and the claim concerning the violation of the standard of constant protection and security under the ECT is without merit.\n\nClaimant\u2019s allegation to the contrary at the January-February 2008 hearing (H. Tr., Day 1, 28 January 2008, p. 21 lines 17 *et seq.)* is unsupported by evidence.\n\n272.\n\nFinally, the Arbitral Tribunal is not persuaded by the evidence that it was the \"paper profits\" issue that made it impossible for Claimant or Nova Plama to obtain financing for the operation of the Refinery. As Counsel for Claimant stated at the January-February 2008 hearing (H. Tr. Day 1, January 28, 2008, p. 42), Nova Plama in 1998 *\"had bad credit, and no company or bank would advance money to it.\"* It is therefore not apparent how Bulgaria\u2019s conduct could have deprived Claimant of the economic benefits of its investment. Claimant\u2019s claim concerning expropriation on this account must be dismissed.\n\n273.\n\nIn conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal finds no evidence that Bulgaria violated its obligations under the ECT (assuming it applies to this issue) towards Claimant with respect to the paper profits issue and, therefore, rejects Claimant\u2019s claims.\n\n**4. Varna Port**\n-----------------\n\n**4.1 The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nClaimant submits that Varna Port is the only Bulgarian port through which crude oil and oil products can be supplied to it by tankers. It contends that, under Bulgarian law, Varna Port is \"exclusive state property\", by virtue of the constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria,58 the Bulgarian Law on Maritime Spaces, Internal Water Roads and Ports, the Law on Concessions and court decisions. It explains that Varna Port was under the control of a State-owned entity, Petrol A.D., which was privatized in 1999. Claimant says that, contrary to Bulgarian law and its constitution, the Bulgarian Government purported to include Varna Port in the assets owned by Petrol A.D. at the time it was privatized. Even if Varna Port could be transferred to private ownership, it was not transferred to the privatized Petrol A.D. in accordance with the methods available for such transfers under Bulgarian law.\n\nClaimant\u2019s legal expert, Mr. Denev, opined in his statement of 28 October 2005 that under the Bulgarian Constitution ports were \"republican roads\" which could not be privatized.\n\n275.\n\nAs a consequence of Varna Port\u2019s unlawful possession by Petrol A.D., Nova Plama (according to Claimant) could not deal with Petrol A.D. since it was not a lawful owner of the port. It could not know with legal certainty with whom it should contract to obtain port services at Varna. Nor did Nova Plama have any guarantee that it would have access to Varna Port as a public service provided by the State in the future. Respondent refused to provide it any assurances that, if it negotiated a contract with Petrol A.D., its contractual rights would be respected. Petrol A.D. was in a position to abuse its dominant position by terminating unreasonably Nova Plama\u2019s access to the port or by imposing on it unreasonable conditions. In fact, Claimant alleges, the newly privatized Petrol A.D., controlled by the Naftex Group, a competitor of Nova Plama (Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits, para. 37), threatened Nova Plama and attempted to impose outrageous prices and conditions for the transit of its crude oil through Varna Port.\n\n276.\n\nClaimant also complains that Bulgaria amended its Maritime Law in 2004 to make fundamental changes in the regime governing its ports of public transport. By virtue of this amendment, Varna Port can now be divided into two parts, one remaining public property (wharfs, piers, beach and acquatorium) and the other (a load storage area) as the property of Petrol A.D. Claimant characterizes this amendment as arbitrary and unlawful, causing Nova Plama significant loss, in violation of the ECT.\n\n277.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s actions, says Claimant, are a violation of its obligation in Article 10(1) of the ECT to accord PCL fair and equitable treatment, and the most constant protection and security to its investment and have subjected its investment to unreasonable measures. Taken together with the other actions of Bulgaria *vis-\u00e0-vis* Nova Plama, its unlawful privatization of Varna Port amounts to an expropriation in violation of Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n278.\n\nRespondent replies, first, that Varna Port is not exclusive State property under the Bulgarian constitution or Maritime Act or under decisions of the competent courts and that, therefore, Claimant had no legitimate expectation that the port would remain owned by the State. Respondent points out that there is a pending dispute between Petrol A.D. and the State as to the legal status of certain parts of Varna Port. Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to show that this ownership dispute has had any adverse impact on Nova Plama. According to Respondent, Nova Plama was not denied access to Varna Port or use of its facilities, and, in any event, Nova Plama had other alternatives to Varna Port available to it. Nor has Claimant substantiated its allegation that Petrol A.D. abused a dominant position in its dealings with Nova Plama; and in any case Claimant\u2019s claims of anti-competitive conduct by Petrol A.D. are inadmissible (see Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 348-351).\n\n**4.2 The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nClaimant\u2019s contentions that Respondent violated its obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* PCL under the ECT can be dismissed in a relatively brief manner. This is so because the Arbitral Tribunal finds no evidence that Nova Plama was in any way denied access to Varna Port and to the use of its facilities on commercially reasonable terms. In its submissions to the Tribunal, Claimant complains about the effects of the privatisation of Varna Port on its ability to use the port and its facilities. It alleges that the new owner of the port threatened Nova Plama\u2019s representatives and intended to drive the company back into bankruptcy; but the Tribunal has been unable to verify these allegations through any cogent evidence in the record. Otherwise, the concerns expressed by Claimant seem largely theoretical; and there is persuasive evidence that in practice - if Nova Plama had really wanted access to the port and its facilities - it could have obtained it on terms equivalent to other users. The evidence shows that Rexoil, an affiliated company of Nova Plama, imported oil through Varna Port throughout the year 1999. Why Nova Plama could not do the same was never explained to the satisfaction of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n280.\n\nClaimant\u2019s allegations that Varna Port was unconstitutionally privatized do not fall within the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to determine but rather that of the Bulgarian courts. However, the ordinary meaning of the words \"republican roads\" in the Bulgarian constitution, relied upon by Claimant to show that Varna Port was exclusive State property, does not seem to include ports.59 Claimant\u2019s concern that the ownership of Varna Port by Petrol A.D., an alleged competitor of Nova Plama, gave it power to strangle Nova Plama by charging it exorbitant rates or denying it access to and use of the port and its facilities could and should have been tested by Nova Plama\u2019s entering into negotiations with Petrol A.D. to see whether commercially acceptable terms could be obtained. Even if Claimant believed that Petrol A.D. was not the legal owner of the port facilities, with the backing of the Government, it could, nevertheless, have negotiated with those who were incontestably in control of the port. The Government offered its assistance in this regard (see, for example, R\u2019s Exhs. 458, 463, 465 and 481). There was no evidence that any other person or enterprise had any like difficulty in negotiating terms for use of the port or actually using it, including Rexoil, Claimant\u2019s affiliate.60 While the evidence shows that there were some exchanges and meetings between representatives of Nova Plama and Petrol A.D., there was no evidence that Nova Plama or PCL made any serious effort to work out the terms of an agreement with Petrol A.D. for the use of Varna Port, despite Claimant\u2019s contention in its Post-Hearing Submission on the Merits (at paragraph 82 and elsewhere) that it *\"attempted to negotiate a renewal of its contract with Petrol.\"* The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that Respondent had an obligation to assure Nova Plama that its rights under any contract it negotiated with Petrol A.D. would be respected, as Claimant demanded.\n\nSee also Article 3(2) of the Bulgarian Roads Act, cited in Professor Chipev\u2019s legal opinion of 16 July 2006, para. 163: *\"[T]he republican roads shall be motorways and first, second and third grade roads ensuring transportation connections of national significance and forming the state road network.\"*\n\nSee R\u2019s Exhs. 881, 882, 883, 884, 885, 886, 984, 985, 986, 987 and 988.\n\n281.\n\nMoreover, the acts of Petrol A.D. complained of by Claimant cannot be attributed to Respondent under Bulgarian or international law. There is no evidence that the Government intervened with Petrol A.D. in any way to encourage it to deny Nova Plama\u2019s use of Varna Port on reasonable commercial terms. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the Government tried to assist Claimant and the Refinery to make an arrangement that would allow fuel to flow to the Refinery.\n\n282.\n\nThe fact that the Government privatized Varna Port is not, in and of itself, violative of any obligation it owed to Claimant under the ECT. There is nothing in the ECT which would prevent Bulgaria from privatizing its ports so long as it was done in a way which did not discriminate against Claimant and did not deprive it of a right necessary to the economic operation of the Refinery - a right which it obtained under its agreements with the Government to purchase the shares of Nova Plama. Nothing in the evidential record persuades the Tribunal that the privatization of Varna Port was done otherwise.61 As for Bulgaria\u2019s amendment of its Maritime Law in 2004, the Arbitral Tribunal finds nothing arbitrary or unlawful in this enactment.\n\nDuring oral argument at the January-February 2008 Hearing concerning Varna Port, Counsel for Claimant alleged that Respondent allowed a Government-owned oil refinery company, Neftochim, to operate in 1999 on discriminatory terms which made competition by Nova Plama nearly impossible (H. Tr., Day 1, January 28, 2008, pp. 23-24). The Arbitral Tribunal is not persuaded by the evidence of these allegations. In any event, allegations of violations of competition law fall outside the scope of arbitration provided for in Article 26 of the ECT. (See ECT, Articles 6(7) and 27).\n\n283.\n\nRespondent\u2019s final argument that, in any event, this amendment occurred after 18 February 2003, when Bulgaria exercised its right to deny the privileges of the ECT to Claimant, falls away, given that the Tribunal in this Award decides that Mr. Vautrin owned or controlled Claimant (para. 95 *supra).*\n\n284.\n\nGiven these elements, the Arbitral Tribunal finds no breach by Respondent of its obligations to Claimant under the ECT with respect to the use of Varna Port.\n\n**5. Biochim Bank**\n-------------------\n\n**5.1 The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nClaimant states that through a State-owned bank, the Commercial Bank Biochim (\"Biochim Bank\"), Nova Plama received credit facilities which resulted in the accrual of significant debts owed by Nova Plama to Biochim Bank. Claimant claims that during the negotiation of Nova Plama\u2019s Recovery Plan, Biochim Bank coerced the company to accept burdensome amendments and refused to fulfil its obligations under the Debt Settlement Agreement and the Recovery Plan unless its amendments were accepted. Thus, according to Claimant, Biochim Bank refused to accept that PCL buy Nova Plama\u2019s debts to Biochim Bank at a discounted value and imposed the requirement that Nova Plama repay 100% of its debts. Biochim Bank had, in Article 4.4 of the Debt Settlement Agreement, agreed, on condition that PCL invest USD 6 million in Nova Plama within two months of the date of start-up of the Refinery, to release Nova Plama\u2019s property pledged and mortgaged to it so that PCL could use the property to attract new investment financing. Nonetheless, Biochim Bank reneged on its undertaking even though PCL fulfilled its investment commitment.\n\n286.\n\nIn addition, Biochim Bank refused to extend the time limit for repayment by Nova Plama of its debts to Biochim Bank even though such extension was foreseen in the Recovery Plan, threatening to reopen Nova Plama\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n287.\n\nIn 2002, Nova Plama contends it tried unsuccessfully to negotiate another debt settlement agreement with Biochim Bank. It then filed a claim against Biochim Bank in the Sofia City Court, which prompted the Bulgarian Ministry of Transport to convoke the company\u2019s management to a meeting where, according to Claimant, they were threatened that the State, as a creditor of Nova Plama, would reopen the insolvency proceedings if it did not withdraw the court action. Claimant also alleges that the chairman of Biochim Bank was convoked to a meeting in the Bulgarian Parliament and instructed not to sign a settlement agreement with Nova Plama. In effect, Claimant says, the Government, which was in the process of privatizing Biochim Bank, favored Biochim Bank to the detriment of PCL and Nova Plama, in order to increase the value of Biochim Bank for purposes of its privatization.\n\n288.\n\nBiochim Bank was eventually privatized in June 2002 and sold to Bank Austria. According to Claimant, as soon as Biochim Bank was no longer controlled by the Bulgarian State, Nova Plama reached a debt settlement agreement with Bank Austria.\n\n289.\n\nBecause of the Government\u2019s ownership interest in Biochim Bank, Claimant submits that Biochim Bank\u2019s actions *vis-\u00e0-vis* Nova Plama violate the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT by breaching contractual obligations entered into with PCL. Bulgaria is also in violation of its obligations under Article 22 of the ECT.62\n\nSee Annex for text of Article 22.\n\n290.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s intervention in the relationship of Biochim Bank with Nova Plama is also, contends Claimant, a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT, a violation of Bulgaria\u2019s obligation to provide PCL\u2019s investment the most constant protection and security, a subjection of PCL\u2019s investment to unreasonable measures and that it amounts, together with the other acts of Bulgaria complained of by Claimant, to an expropriation in violation of Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n291.\n\nRespondent\u2019s reply is, essentially, that there is no persuasive evidence of State intervention in Biochim Bank\u2019s decision-making, that Biochim Bank acted in a commercially predictable and reasonable manner in its dealings with Nova Plama and that Biochim Bank did not breach any contractual obligation. On the contrary, Respondent contends, Claimant and Nova Plama made unrealistic and commercially unreasonable demands of the bank, and even when Biochim Bank agreed to terms with Nova Plama, the latter failed to fulfil its obligations.\n\n292.\n\nRespondent says that the Debt Settlement Agreement, which provided for Biochim Bank\u2019s release of its mortgage over the Nova Plama plant, never entered into force because it was not signed by all parties, including Biochim Bank, as required by its Article 5.1, and, therefore, Biochim Bank cannot be said to have breached any contractual obligations under it. Moreover, Respondent contends that Claimant has never provided any evidence that it fulfilled its commitment to invest at least USD 6 million within two months of the date of start-up of the Refinery. Finally, Respondent contends, Biochim Bank\u2019s General Meeting of Shareholders never approved the release of its mortgage, a requirement of the Debt Settlement Agreement.\n\n293.\n\nRespondent denies that Biochim Bank coerced Claimant to accept burdensome amendments to the Recovery Plan. It claims that PCL and Nova Plama themselves submitted an amendment to the Recovery Plan which provided that all creditors of Nova Plama, including Biochim Bank, would retain their preexisting secured interests (R\u2019s Exh. 407). The amended Recovery Plan did not obligate Biochim Bank to release its mortgage over the Refinery. Even if Biochim Bank had released its mortgage, says Respondent, Claimant has failed to prove that it would have been able to secure additional financing for Nova Plama\u2019s operations.\n\n294.\n\nRespondent also contradicts Claimant\u2019s assertion that as soon as Biochim Bank was privatized and no longer under Government control, Nova Plama reached a debt settlement with the bank. Respondent says it took two years of negotiation to reach that settlement which settlement was due essentially to the unlikelihood by that time that Biochim Bank could ever recover any significant amounts from Nova Plama. Respondent says Nova Plama has never paid anything to Biochim Bank.\n\n295.\n\nIn any event, Respondent contends that the acts of Biochim Bank are not attributable to the State of Bulgaria, which cannot be responsible for them under Article 10(1) of the ECT. Nor is Article 22 of the ECT applicable, since that provision is found in Part IV of the ECT and, therefore, does not fall within the scope of an arbitration under Article 26. Moreover, Biochim Bank is and was even prior to its privatization a commercial bank governed by private law and not a \"State enterprise\" within the meaning of Article 22 of the ECT.\n\n**5.2 The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nAs noted above, Claimant contends that Biochim Bank, a State-owned bank, *\"coerced\"* Nova Plama into accepting *\"burdensome amendments\"* and deliberately refused to fulfill its obligations under the Debt Settlement Agreement and the Recovery Plan, causing Nova Plama great difficulties in obtaining new financing. Moreover, Claimant alleges that the State interfered with Biochim Bank and prevented it from reaching a settlement agreement with Nova Plama prior to Biochim Bank\u2019s privatization. Claimant attributes this unlawful conduct to the State on one of two alternative grounds: (i) because Biochim Bank was a State-owned bank and the State used its ownership interest to direct the bank\u2019s acts; and (ii) because of the application of Article 22 of the ECT to Biochim Bank\u2019s conduct.\n\n297.\n\nArticle 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility contemplates the possibility that the conduct of companies or enterprises owned or controlled by the State be attributable to that state. In the Commentary to the Articles, the ILC notes that:\n\n*Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their* *activities is not attributable to the State, unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority..63*\n\nCommentary to Article 8 of the ILC Articles, p. 107, para. 6.\n\n298.\n\nHowever, before the question of attribution arises, it is first necessary to determine whether the corporation has in fact engaged in an unlawful act. The ILC notes in this respect that \"[i]f *such corporations* [State-owned and controlled] *act inconsistently with the international obligations of the State concerned the question arises whether such conduct is attributable to the State.\"64* The Arbitral Tribunal will therefore proceed to determine whether Biochim Bank acted inconsistently with Respondent\u2019s obligations under the ECT.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n299.\n\nOn the evidence before it, the Arbitral Tribunal is not persuaded that Biochim Bank acted *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimant and Nova Plama other than reasonably for its own commercial interests. Nor does it accept Claimant\u2019s argument that Biochim Bank\u2019s refusal to give up its mortgage over Nova Plama\u2019s assets amounted to a breach by Respondent of its obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimant in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n300.\n\nFurthermore, while Respondent\u2019s argument that the Debt Settlement Agreement by which Biochim Bank gave up its mortgage over Nova Plama\u2019s assets never entered into force is correct; Biochim Bank\u2019s refusal to give up its mortgage on Nova Plama\u2019s assets was also accepted by Claimant and Nova Plama and confirmed in the Recovery Plan, as amended pursuant to a proposal made by Claimant itself (R. Exh. 407). Undoubtedly, Claimant was under pressure to accept Biochim Bank\u2019s position; but it was free not to accept it and refuse to make further investments on those conditions. It still had considerable negotiating leverage at that time, given Respondent\u2019s strong desire to see Nova Plama continue operations.\n\n301.\n\nNor does the Tribunal find convincing the evidence presented by Claimant that Biochim Bank breached the Recovery Plan or that Respondent exercised undue pressure on Nova Plama to force it into accepting burdensome conditions. In particular, the evidence is not sufficient to substantiate the claim that Bulgaria interfered in any way with Biochim Bank\u2019s reasonable commercial decision to decline Nova Plama\u2019s settlement offer.\n\n302.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Biochim Bank has not engaged in any unlawful act. There is, therefore, no need to address the question of attribution, nor the issue under Article 22 of the ECT.\n\n303.\n\nIn conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has not committed any violation of its obligations under the ECT with respect to Biochim Bank.\n\n**6. Re-opened Bankruptcy Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nClaimant contended that the re-opened bankruptcy proceedings in 2005 were violative of its rights (Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paras. 229 *et seq).* The claim was subject to supplementation, depending on the outcome of local proceedings initiated to contest the decision to re-open the bankruptcy proceedings. Claimant did not submit evidence which persuaded the Tribunal of the merits of this claim.\n\n**D. Concluding Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nBased on all that the Arbitral Tribunal has seen and heard in this arbitration, it concludes that what happened with respect to Claimant\u2019s investment in Nova Plama is that Mr. Vautrin and PCL undertook a high risk project, without having the financial assets of their own to carry it out. It was based on an ambitious plan to borrow enough money to get the Refinery into operation, hoping thereby to generate sufficient revenues through sales of product to finance the continuing operation of the Refinery, to pay off Nova Plama\u2019s creditors over time, to pay wages to the Refinery\u2019s workers and to make a profit. Unfortunately, for reasons which, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, were not attributable to any unlawful actions of Bulgaria, Mr. Vautrin\u2019s plan did not work, and Nova Plama fell back into bankruptcy.\n\n**E. Damages**\n--------------\n\n306.\n\nSince the Arbitral Tribunal has found that Claimant is not entitled to the protections of the ECT and that, in any event, Respondent did not breach its obligations to Claimant under the ECT, the Tribunal need not address Claimant\u2019s claims for damages.\n\n**F. Costs**\n------------\n\n307.\n\nClaimant requests an award to it of the costs of the arbitration, including legal fees and other costs, as well as such other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n308.\n\nLikewise, Respondent claims all costs of the arbitration, including its legal fees and other costs, and adds that this is so regardless of whether any aspect of Claimant\u2019s case is sustained, because of the obstructionist tactics used by Claimant in this arbitration. Respondent did not claim interest on these costs.\n\n309.\n\nEach Party has, pursuant to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s request, subdivided its costs into different categories: costs for the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, costs for the procedure relating to Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures, costs for the procedure relating Respondent\u2019s request for security for costs, and costs for the merits phase of the arbitration.\n\n310.\n\nAccordingly, the Parties have submitted the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Claimant: | USD |\n| Jurisdictional phase:  Provisional remedies Merits phase:  Total: | 1,662,789.49  150,211.00  2,864,521.30  4,677,521.79 |\n| Respondent: |  |\n| Jurisdictional phase:  Request for urgent provisional measures:  Request for security for costs:  Merits phase:  Total: | 3,023,288.00  584,024.00  381,992.00  9,254,053.00  13,243,357.00 |\n\n311.\n\nClaimant has advanced USD 459,985 and Respondent USD 460,000 (totaling USD 919,985) on account of the fees and expenses of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative charges. As of 31 July 2008, interest accrued on the advances made amounted to USD 28,076.82. Therefore, the advances plus interest amounted to USD 948,061.82.\n\n312.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative charges and expenses are the following (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses | 803,866.04 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative charges and expenses | 144,195.78 |\n| Total | 948,061.82 |\n\n313.\n\nThe Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative charges and expenses are paid out of the advances made by the Parties.\n\n314.\n\nArticle 61 of the ICSID Convention provides, with respect to costs, that :\n\n*[...] The Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings and shall decide how and by whom these expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n315.\n\nRule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Award *\"shall contain [...] (j) any decision [...] regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"*\n\n316.\n\nArticle 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Arbitral Tribunal the discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate. In the exercise of this discretion, the Arbitral Tribunal will apply the principle that \"costs follow the event,\" by a weighing of relative success or failure, that is to say, the loser pays costs including reasonable legal and other costs of the prevailing party; or costs are allocated proportionally to the outcome of the case, save for the circumstances described below.\n\n317.\n\nIn this arbitration, in the jurisdictional phase, in which Respondent sought a decision that the Arbitral Tribunal had no jurisdiction, it was in part the losing party. Respondent contended, however, that whether it won or lost on its jurisdictional pleas, it should be awarded costs for that phase of the arbitration because of the behavior of Claimant (Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 370 *et seq.).*\n\n318.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction (para. 238), the Arbitral Tribunal criticized Claimant for not having earlier disclosed to Respondent the details of the ownership and structure of the PCL-PHL-EMU group. That failure of disclosure certainly added to the costs of Respondent during the jurisdictional phase, which have been taken into account by the Tribunal.\n\n319.\n\nFollowing the Decision on Jurisdiction, Claimant made a request for urgent provisional measures, which the Arbitral Tribunal rejected entirely. The Tribunal reserved a decision on the costs resulting from the proceedings on this request to a later stage.\n\n320.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal convened a meeting in Paris on 16 February 2007 to consider with the Parties Respondent\u2019s request to limit the scope of further proceedings and to order Claimant to post security for costs. The Tribunal denied both of Respondent\u2019s requests (see paras. 36-42 *supra).* Mr. Vautrin testified at this meeting that *\"if the costs are reasonable, Plama Consortium will pay through disposal of other assets\"* (H. Tr. p. 55).\n\n321.\n\nIn the merits phase, Respondent is not only the prevailing party, but the Arbitral Tribunal has found that Claimant was guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation in obtaining its investment in Bulgaria and has denied to Claimant the protections of the ECT for that reason.\n\n322.\n\nIn light of these factors and in particular the circumstance mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that Claimant shall bear all of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative charges plus the reasonable legal fees and other costs incurred by Respondent.\n\n323.\n\nAs to the reasonable amount of those legal fees and other costs, taking into account all the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal determines those fees and other costs of Respondent at USD 7,000,000.\n\n324.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that Claimant will bear all fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative charges and will order Claimant to pay to Respondent USD 460,000 on account of its advance on costs as well as USD 7,000,000 as a reasonable proportion of Respondent\u2019s legal fees and other costs.\n\n**VI. Dispositive**\n-------------------\n\n325.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following decisions:\n\n1. Incorporates by reference its Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005;\n\n2. Respondent cannot rely on Article 17(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty to deny Claimant the benefits of Part III of the Treaty until 17 February 2003;\n\n3. Claimant is not entitled to any of the substantive protections afforded by the ECT;\n\n4. Assuming that Claimant would have been entitled to substantive protections afforded by the ECT:\n\n(a) Respondent did not violate its obligations to Claimant under the ECT with respect to issues of past environmental damages; \u2022\n\n(b) Respondent did not violate its obligations to Claimant under the ECT by virtue of the actions of the syndics;\n\n(c) Respondent did not violate its obligations to Claimant under the ECT with respect to the matter of taxation of *\"paper profits'\",* even assuming that the ECT applies to this issue;\n\n(d) Respondent did not breach its obligations to Claimant under the ECT with respect to the use of Varna Port;\n\n(e) Respondent did not breach its obligations to Claimant under the ECT with respect to the actions of Biochim Bank;\n\n(f) The Arbitral Tribunal finds no other violations by Respondent of its obligations to Claimant under the ECT;\n\n(g) The Arbitral Tribunal rejects all Claimant\u2019s claims for damages;\n\n5. Claimant bears all fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative charges, being USD 919,985, which are paid out of the advances made by the Parties.\n\n6. Claimant is ordered to pay Respondent USD 460,000 on account of Respondent\u2019s advance on costs as well as USD 7,000,000 on account of Respondent\u2019s legal fees and other costs.\n\n7. All other claims and requests by the Parties are rejected."}]}
