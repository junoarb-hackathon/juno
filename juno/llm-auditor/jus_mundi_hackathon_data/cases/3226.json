Thereafter, the Tribunal resolved outstanding issues with the transcripts.\n\n**K.** **The Sun-Flower award, Post-Hearing briefs and Related Matters**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nOn 10 September 2021, the Claimants requested that the Respondent be ordered to disclose the award issued in ICSID Case No. ARB/16/17, *Sun-Flower Olmeda GmbH & Co. KG and others v. Spain,* as well as the dissenting opinion of Professor Kohen, both of which were reportedly issued on 22 June 2021.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, from the publicly available information, the award contained critical aspects of quantum relevant to this case, which justified Claimants\u2019 request to introduce it to the record.\n\n176.\n\nOn 16 September 2021, the Respondent commented that the Claimant\u2019s request was late and untimely, since it should have been made as soon as the Claimants had become aware of the existence of the award. It also argued that the request was unfounded, insofar as it failed to comply with the requirements of Section 27 of PO 1 and Article 27.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Finally, it argued that the award was irrelevant to this case.\n\n177.\n\nOn 22 September 2021, the Tribunal concluded that the Claimants\u2019 request was not untimely. However, prior to deciding whether to grant the request, it invited the Respondent to secure the consent to disclose the award from the claimants in the Sun-Flower arbitration.\n\n178.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, the Respondent advised that the claimants in the Sun-Flower arbitration had consented to the disclosure of those sections of the Award relating to the tax gross up, and that a redacted version of the award would be transmitted shortly.\n\n179.\n\nOn 4 October 2021, the Respondent submitted the redacted version of the Sun-Flower award. Accordingly, the Tribunal invited either Party to assign an appropriate exhibit number to the Sun-Flower Award and to submit such award into the record with its first post-hearing brief.\n\n180.\n\nOn 19 November 2021, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their first post-hearing briefs (respectively, \"C-PHB1\" and R-PHB1\"). The Claimants introduced the Sun-Flower award as CL-319. The C-PHB1 was also accompanied by an Annex 1. With R-PHB1, the Respondent introduced legal authorities RL-0415 through to RL-0421.\n\n181.\n\nOn 29 November 2021, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to strike from the record legal authorities RL-0415, RL-0417, RL-0419, RL-0420. It argued that according to PO8, the Respondent was permitted to introduce new legal authorities in its PHB only to the extent that these authorities were published after the date of its last written submission (i.e., 5 March 2021). However, the legal authorities in question had been published before the date of the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder (its last written submission) and as such, were inadmissible.\n\n182.\n\nOn that same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent\u2019s comments on this issue.\n\n183.\n\nOn 3 December 2021 the Respondent requested the Tribunal to deny Claimants\u2019 request.\n\n184.\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the Tribunal decided to strike RL-0415 and RL-0417 from the record, insofar as the Respondent had not sufficiently established that the exception set out in para. 8 of PO8, second sentence, applied to these legal authorities, nor had it requested leave to introduce them into the record. As to RL-0419 and RL-020, the Tribunal considered that these were authorities submitted in the context of the tax gross up claim, and as a reaction to the introduction of Sun-Flower award pursuant to the request from the Claimants. As such, the Respondent was authorized to introduce them into the record at that stage.\n\n185.\n\nOn 13 December 2021, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to strike Annex 1 to the Claimants PHB from the record. According to the Respondent, this document contained new factual information, which was being introduced outside the procedural timetable.\n\n186.\n\nOn 20 December 2021, the Claimants commented on the Respondent\u2019s request, arguing that Annex 1 did not contain any new factual information nor was it submitted outside of the procedural timetable.\n\n187.\n\nOn 27 and 30 December 2021, the Respondent and the Claimants respectively presented further comments on this issue.\n\n188.\n\nOn 3 January 2022, the Tribunal concluded that Annex 1 to the Claimants\u2019 PHB should not be struck from the record, since it merely consisted of a 2-page table summarizing information regarding the investors and their investments, which had been previously introduced into the record by the Claimants. Furthermore, it indicated that the Respondent would have the opportunity to comment on it in the second round of PHBs.\n\n189.\n\nOn 17 January 2022, the Respondent sought leave to introduce seven new documents into the record together with its forthcoming second PHB, which consisted of six news articles summarizing events related to Banco Popular\u2019s assets and accounting practices, as well as the first publicly available decision issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") in proceedings brought by shareholders of Banco Popular in connection with the resolution of the bank.\n\n190.\n\nOn 19 January 2022, the Claimants opposed this request on the basis that it was untimely and that the documents in question did not bear directly and materially on a central issue in dispute.\n\n191.\n\nOn 20 January 2022, regarding the six press reports, the Tribunal decided that the Respondent had not sufficiently established the exceptional circumstances that would warrant their introduction into the record. Regarding the decision of the CJEU, however, the Tribunal concluded that it could be of assistance to the Tribunal, and thus requested the Respondent to file it after the second round of PHBs, due on the next day.\n\n192.\n\nOn 21 January 2022, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their reply post-Hearing briefs (respectively, \"C-PHB2\" and \"R-PHB2\"). Together with its second PHB, the Respondent filed Annex 1.\n\n193.\n\nOn 4 February 2022, the Respondent introduced the decision of the CJEU into the record as Exhibit RL-422 together with brief comments, to which the Claimant responded on 18 February 2022.\n\n**L.** **Costs Submissions and Closure of the Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nOn 18 February 2022, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their submissions on costs (respectively, \"C-Costs Submission\" and \"R-Costs Submission\").\n\n195.\n\nOn 22 April 2022, the Tribunal provided an update on its progress in connection with the Final Award. In that regard, it also inquired whether the Parties would agree that the Tribunal issue the Award in English only, in derogation to Section 3(d) of Procedural Order No. 1, with a view to saving time and costs.\n\n196.\n\nOn 26 April 2022, the Respondent objected against the Tribunal issuing the Award in English only. On the same date, the Claimants advised that they agreed with the Tribunal\u2019s proposal to issue the Award only in English and regretted that the Respondent had not provided its agreement.\n\n197.\n\nOn 29 April 2022, the Tribunal took note of the Parties\u2019 positions on the translation of the Award and, in light of the fact that there was no agreement to derogate from Section 3(d) of Procedural Order No. 1, confirmed that the Award would be issued in both English and Spanish.\n\n198.\n\nOn 13 May 2022, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it wished to introduce into the record a new decision from the CJEU, of 5 May 2022 in Case No. C-410/20 but proposed to introduce it into the record together with other legal authorities that it expected would be forthcoming in the course of the summer. On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide further details on the CJEU judgment which it wished to introduce into the record and on any other legal authorities that it expected may be forthcoming in the coming months.\n\n199.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, on 17 May 2022, the Respondent provided its comments on the CJEU judgment and other legal authorities it wished to introduce into the record. On 20 May 2022, the Claimants provided their comments.\n\n200.\n\nOn 30 May 2022, the Tribunal provided directions in connection with Spain\u2019s request to file into the record the CJEU decision of 5 May 2022 in Case No. C-410/20 and the forthcoming decisions from the CJEU.\n\n201.\n\nOn 9 June 2022, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Respondent followed up with a request to submit into the record additional decisions from the CJEU. The Claimants provided their comments on 16 June 2022.\n\n202.\n\nOn 21 June 2022, the Tribunal (i) denied Spain\u2019s request to introduce the CJEU decision in Case C-410/20 into the record; (ii) granted Spain leave to file five CJEU decisions issued on 1 June 2022 into the record, giving directions to both Parties to provide their comments on those decisions; and (iii) denied Spain\u2019s request to file the so-called Valuation Decision referred to at paragraph 11 of the Respondent\u2019s letter of 9 June 2022.\n\n203.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, on 11 July 2022, the Respondent provided its comments in connection with the five CJEU decisions of 1 June 2022. On 29 July 2022, the Claimants provided their reply comments.\n\n204.\n\nOn 22 December 2022, the PCA informed the Parties, on behalf of the Tribunal, that the Award would be issued both in English and Spanish around the end of February or the beginning of March 2023. In that same communication, the PCA asked the Parties to verify the list of the Parties\u2019 representatives to be recorded in the Award, as well to make a final payment into the arbitration deposit.\n\n205.\n\nOn 4 December 2022, the Parties communicated their amended list of Parties' representatives to be recorded in the Award.\n\n206.\n\nOn 27 February 2023, the Tribunal closed the proceedings in accordance with Article 31 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n207.\n\nOn 3 March 2023, the President of the Tribunal made a disclosure to the Parties.\n\n**III. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------\n\n**A.** **The Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nIn its C-PHB2, the Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons and those previously set forth in their submissions, and subject to their reservation of the right to submit evidence from the Audiencia Nacional proceedings upon the conclusion of the ongoing Investigation Phase, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n\u2022 Finding that this dispute falls within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction;\n\n\u2022 Finding that Respondent has breached its obligations under Articles III, IV and V of the Treaty;\n\n\u2022 Ordering Respondent to pay compensation to Claimants in the amount of \u20ac492 million, grossed up to \u20ac647.1 million;\n\n\u2022 Ordering Respondent to pay interest on the above amount at a reasonable commercial rate of 8% for stocks and 7.25% for subordinated debt, compounded from 16 August 2019 until full payment has been made; and\n\n\u2022 Ordering Respondent to pay Claimants' legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings.\"12\n\nSee C-PHB2, para. 217. See also SoC, para. 436; Reply, para. 946.\n\n**B.** **The Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIn its R-PHB1, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\n\"As a consequence of the foregoing, Respondent respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal render an award:\n\n(i) Declaring its lack of jurisdiction over the claims of the Claimants or, if applicable, the inadmissibility of said claims;\n\n(ii) Dismissing, in the alternative to (i) above, all of the Claimants\u2019 claims on the merits and declaring that the Kingdom of Spain has not breached the BIT in any way;\n\n(iii) Dismissing, in the alternative to (i)-(ii) above, all of the Claimants\u2019 claims for damages as said claims are not entitled to compensation; and\n\n(iv) Requiring Claimants to bear all the costs of the arbitration, including Respondent\u2019s legal and expert fees and costs, and Respondent\u2019s internal costs, together with interest on such fees and costs.\"13\n\nR-PHB1, para. 376. See also Rejoinder, para. 1197; SoD, para. 1196.\n\n210.\n\nThis request for relief remained unchanged.\n\n**IV. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n---------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will address the scope of this Award (A); the applicable laws (B); the relevance of prior awards (C); the language of the Treaty (D); and the transparency of the proceeding and other Treaty provisions (E).\n\n**A.** **Scope of this Award**\n------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThis Award deals with jurisdiction, admissibility and merits.\n\n**B.** **The Applicable Laws**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Law Governing the Arbitration Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nParagraph 35 of the TOA provides as follows in connection with the applicable procedural rules:\n\n\"This arbitration shall be governed by (in the following order of precedence):\n\na. The mandatory rules of the law on international arbitration applicable at the seat of the arbitration;\n\nb. The 2013 UNCITRAL Rules (except the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration), save where modified by these Terms of Appointment;\n\nc. The procedural rules contained in the Treaty, save where modified by these Terms of Appointment;\n\nd. These Terms of Appointment and the procedural rules issued by the Tribunal, as will be reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 and any amendments thereto.\"\n\n214.\n\nIn addition, paragraph 36 of the TOA sets forth that [i]f the provisions therein do not address a specific procedural issue, that issue shall be determined by agreement between the Parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by the Tribunal\".\n\n**2. Law Governing the Merits of the Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nArticle XV of the Treaty, entitled \"Applicable Law\", provides as follows:\n\n\"1. Any tribunal established in accordance with this Section shall issue its ruling in the disputes submitted to it in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n2. Any interpretation set forth by the Contracting Parties by mutual agreement concerning a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on any tribunal established pursuant thereto.\"\n\n216.\n\nThus, in accordance with Article XV(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal will apply the Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n***3. Jura Novit Arbiter***\n---------------------------\n\n217.\n\nAccording to the principle of *jura novit curia,* when applying the law, the Tribunal may consider not only the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties, but also the law of its own motion, provided it seeks the Parties\u2019 views if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.14\n\nIn the investment treaty context, see, *inter alia,* **Exh. CL-287,** *Deutsche Telekom v. India,* PCA Case No. 2014-10, Interim Award, 13 December 2017, para. 112; *Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, para. 118; *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, para. 295.\n\n**C.** **The Relevance of Prior Awards**\n----------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in other cases to support their positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n219.\n\nWhile not bound by previous decisions or awards in other cases, the Tribunal may give due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases reflecting a sufficient consensus amongst international adjudicators. It further believes that, subject always to the specific text of the Treaty, and with due regard to the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law in furtherance of the certainty of the rule of law.\n\n**D.** **Languages of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAs a final preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Treaty\u2019s official language is Spanish.15 The official Spanish language version of the Treaty and its unofficial English version were introduced into the record as Exh. RL-40 and Exh. C-1 respectively. There is no allegation by either Party that the English translation of the BIT is in any material respect different from the Spanish original or otherwise inaccurate.\n\nSee **Exh. C-1,** Treaty, Article XXIV, para. 2 (\"DONE at Mexico City on 10 October 2006 in two original copies in the Spanish language, both texts being equally authentic\").\n\n221.\n\nKeeping in mind that the Award is issued in both Spanish and English,16 in the following discussion the Tribunal generally refers only to one version of the Treaty (the English version of the Treaty in the English version of the Award, and the Spanish version of the Treaty in the Spanish version), except where it finds it useful to refer to both texts to highlight a particular point or conclusion.\n\nSee TOA, para. 30; PO1, para. 3 d. See also the exchanges between the Tribunal and the Parties recounted *supra* at paras. 195-197.\n\n**E.** **Transparency and other Treaty provisions**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nIn accordance with Article XVI, paragraph 4, of the Treaty, this award \"shall be public\". Pursuant to paragraph 39 of the TOA, prior to said publication, the Tribunal will consult the Parties on the passages of the award which they may seek to redact. In case of disagreements between the Parties as to the proposed redactions, the Tribunal will make a decision.\n\n223.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that Article XVI, paragraph 3, of the Treaty states as follows: \"The award shall stipulate that it is made without prejudice to the rights that any person with a legal interest may have in the relief under applicable local legislation\". In the official Spanish version, the same provision reads somewhat differently: \"[e]*l laudo se dictar\u00e1 sin perjuicio de los derechos que cualquier persona con inter\u00e9s jur\u00eddico tenga sobre la reparaci\u00f3n conforme a la legislaci\u00f3n local aplicable.*\n\n224.\n\nNeither Party has relied or commented on this provision. The Tribunal thus need not make any finding in this respect but to emphasize the existence of this rule.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and/or the claims are inadmissible on the following grounds:\n\n\u2022 Spain has not consented to this arbitration, because the Claimants commenced this proceeding in disregard of the Treaty\u2019s waiver and fork-in-the-road clauses (A);\n\n\u2022 The claims are based on the acts of EU authorities or private entities, which are not attributable to Spain (B);\n\n\u2022 The Claimants did not make any investment protected by the Treaty (C);\n\n\u2022 The claims fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis* (D);\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over eight Claimants who are dual Mexican and Spanish nationals (E);\n\n\u2022 Some Claimants engaged in abusive, bad faith or unlawful conduct in connection with their alleged investment in Banco Popular (F).\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, argue that none of Spain\u2019s objections have any merit.\n\n227.\n\nSpain\u2019s objections and the Claimants\u2019 responses are addressed in more detail in the following sections.\n\n**A.** **Spain\u2019s Consent to Arbitration: Waiver and Fork-In-The-Road Clauses**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nSpain first argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants have not complied with the conditions to which Spain\u2019s consent to arbitrate under the Treaty is subject. Specifically, the Respondent contends that the Claimants commenced this proceeding in breach of the waiver requirements set out in Article X(5) (1),17 and the fork-in-the-road provision contained in Article X(1) of the Treaty (2).18\n\nRequest for Trifurcation, paras. 98-108; SoD, paras. 510-554; Rejoinder, paras. 597-637; R-PHB1, paras. 14-17; R-PHB2, para. 5.\n\nRequest for Trifurcation, paras. 87-97; SoD, paras. 555-560; Rejoinder, paras. 638-647.\n\n229.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants maintain that they have complied with the waiver and fork-in-the-road requirements of the Treaty and that, therefore, Spain\u2019s *ratione voluntatis* objection lacks merit.19\n\nResponse to Trifurcation, paras. 34-50; Reply, paras. 358-404; C-PHB1, paras. 313-323; C-PHB2, paras. 198-200.\n\n**1. The waiver pursuant to Article X(5) of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a.** ***The Respondent\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nSpain contends that the Claimants have initiated this arbitration in disregard of Article X(5) of the Treaty, as they have submitted a waiver that does not meet the formal requirements of the Treaty (i),20 and have commenced and continued parallel proceedings before the CJEU in connection with the measures challenged in this arbitration (the \"CJEU Proceeding\") (ii).21\n\nSoD, paras. 513-537; Rejoinder, paras. 600-623.\n\nSoD, paras. 538-554; Rejoinder, paras. 624-637. See also Respondent\u2019s letter to Tribunal, 11 July 2022, paras. 26-27.\n\n**i.** ***Formal Requirements of Article X(5)***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nFor Spain, the Treaty requires the Claimants to waive their right to challenge the contested measures in other fora. Relying on the decision in *Waste Management,* the Respondent makes two general observations on how Article X(5) of the Treaty operates. First, a waiver is a condition for the State\u2019s consent. As a result, if the Claimants\u2019 waiver does not comply with Article X(5), Spain\u2019s consent is lacking and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. Second, a waiver seeks to avoid parallel proceedings related to the same measures. Thus, to comply with the Treaty, the Claimants\u2019 waiver must cover all measures challenged in this arbitration.22\n\nSoD, paras. 518, 520 referring to **Exh. RL-0157,** *Waste Management v. Mexico,* ICSID Case ARB(AF)/98/2, Award, 2 June 2000, pp. 219-237. In support of its arguments, Spain also refers to the following decisions: **Exh. RL-0085,** *Detroit International Bridge Company v. Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction, 2 April 2015, paras. 291, 293; **Exh. RL-0086,** *Railroad Development Corporation v. Guatemala,* Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction, 17 November 2008, para. 48; **Exh. RL-0088,** *The Renco Group Inc. v. Peru I,* Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 15 July 2016, paras. 81-85, 119; **Exh. RL-0089,** *Commerce Group Corp. v. El Salvador,* Award, 14 March 2011, para. 115.\n\n232.\n\nSpain takes issue with the two documents submitted by the Claimants together with the Notice of Arbitration, i.e. the waiver contained in the body of the Notice (the \"NOA Waiver\"),23 and the so-called Side Letters appended to the Notice (the \"Side Letters\").24 It argues that neither the NOA Waiver nor the Side Letters comply with Article X(5) of the Treaty, because these documents do not cover the measures adopted by the EU authorities which are discussed in this arbitration.25 This carve-out enables the Claimants to challenge the same measures twice, once before this Tribunal and once before the CJEU, which goes against Article X(5) of the Treaty.26\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 147, referring to Appendix **CRFA-C.**\n\n**Exh.

Even after Respondent decided to sell Banco Popular to Santander in resolution, it provided no notice to Claimants or opportunity to be heard before wiping out their investments.* | *\"[Tjhe Applicants were only advised of the cancellation of their respective shareholdings in Banco Popular, and the sale of Banco Popular to Banco Santander for 1 euro, on 7 June 2017; i.e. the date of the Contested Decisions. Indeed, the majority of the Applicants were only informed about the Contested Decisions through media* |\n| *Many Claimants learned from the media that their investments in Banco Popular had been completely wiped out.34* | *reports. As a result, the Applicants were deprived, among other things, of the opportunity to make representations regarding the availability of other private sector measures that could have restored Banco Popular to viability within a reasonable timeframe\".35* |\n| *\"Respondent made unprecedented and alarming public announcements that further undermined public confidence in Banco Popular. Such conduct, which predictably harmed the bank and fostered greater instability in the Spanish banking sector, had no legitimate policy purpose. It also arbitrarily precipitated the very circumstances that it later used to justify the pre-arranged handover of Banco Popular to Santander via resolution.36* | *\"[T]he statements made (on repeated occasions) by the SRB directly contributed to the liquidity issues Banco Popular faced. The SRB\u2019s own role in precipitating the liquidity issues that Banco Popular faced was a key factor that ought to have been taken into account by the SRB in its assessment of the private sale process, and the availability of private sector measures more generally\".37* |\n| *\"Respondent\u2019s acts directly and indirectly expropriated Claimants\u2019 interest in Banco Popular. First, Respondent engaged in acts and omissions that progressively harmed Banco Popular, significantly impairing the value of its assets by the date of the resolution. Then, on 6 June 2017, the expropriation crystallized when Respondent wiped out Claimants\u2019 investment entirely, taking Claimants shares away without any compensation whatsoever and handing them over to Santanderi\u2019.38* | *\"The Defendants have, by the Contested Decisions, interfered with the Applicants\u2019 right not to be deprived of their possessions... and/or their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions... The write down of the nominal value of Banco Popular\u2019s share capital, which resulted in the cancellation of 100% of Banco Popular\u2019s share capital, is a paradigm case of deprivation. The same is true of the conversion of the bonds to shares, and the subsequent write down of those shares. As a consequence of the Contested Decisions, the Applicants\u2019 shares and bonds have lost all appreciable economic value and the deprivation is permanent\".39* |\n| Regarding their expropriation and loss of possession claims, on the one hand Claimants allege that it was Spain who *\"failed to provide any compensation\".40* | On the other hand, before the CJEU, Claimants assert that it was the SRB whose acts were *\"unjustifiable because of the absence of any compensation to the Applicants.41* |\n\nSoD, para. 538-554; Rejoinder, para. 624-637; R-PHB1, para. 16; R-PHB2, para. 5.\n\nSoD, paras. 519, 538-551. The Claimants initiated proceedings before the CJEU on 4 August 2017, and one year later on 23 August 2018, they submitted their Notice of Arbitration. See **Exh.

More specifically, the CJEU Proceeding may render this arbitration moot, if the claim succeeds and the CJEU annuls the resolution of Banco Popular. Furthermore, there is a risk of double recovery and inconsistent decisions.42\n\nSoD, paras. 552-554; Rejoinder, para. 634; R-PHB1, paras. 16-17.\n\n**b.** ***The Claimants\u2019 position***\n------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they have complied with Article X(5) of the Treaty, because the NOA Waiver and the Side Letters employed language consistent with the Treaty (i); and the CJEU Proceeding involves a different factual and legal matrix (ii).43\n\nResponse to Trifurcation, paras. 44-50; Reply, paras. 358-390; C-PHB1, paras. 313-323; C-PHB2, paras. 198-200.\n\n**i.** ***Formal Requirements of Article X(5)***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimants deny having failed to meet the formal requirements of Article X(5).44 They observe that the Treaty does not prescribe how a waiver must be expressed.45 Accordingly, a waiver does not need to reproduce the treaty language *verbatim46* or be filed with the Notice of Arbitration. In support of this argument, the Claimants refer to several arbitral awards, where investment tribunals accepted waivers adopting wording different from that of the applicable BIT47 or filed with submissions other than the Notice of Arbitration.48\n\nReply, paras. 365-381; C-PHB1, paras. 313-319; C-PHB2, para. 198.\n\nReply, para. 364.\n\nThe Claimants note that this was confirmed by Spain.

United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Award, 26 January 2006, para. 116.\n\n238.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, both the NOA Waiver and the Side Letters comply with the Treaty. First, the language of the NOA Waiver is almost identical to Article X(5)(b), the only distinction being the absence of the term \"any proceedings\" in the NOA Waiver. The Claimants explain that \"[t]his was quite obviously a typographical error and no meaning should be ascribed to it\".49 Second, as regards the Side Letters, the deviations from the text of the Treaty50 did not affect the scope of the waiver.51\n\nReply, para. 362.\n\nReply, paras. 365-369.\n\nFor instance, the Side Letter mentions \"the Kingdom of Spain\" rather than the \"Contracting Party\".\n\n239.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants have offered to provide a revised waiver, if the Tribunal finds the NOA Waiver and the Side Letters defective.52\n\nResponse to Trifurcation, para. 49; Reply, paras. 361-364, 380.\n\n**ii.** ***The CJEU Proceeding***\n---------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that they have not breached the Treaty by initiating the CJEU Proceeding and this arbitration.53 In their interpretation, Article X(5) is similar to other clauses contained in investment treaties and only prohibits an investor from suing Spain in both international and domestic fora.54 By contrast, Article X(5) does not prohibit pursuing claims against third parties, in courts outside of Spain or Mexico, for actions other than those challenged in this arbitration.55 Accordingly, the Claimants did not violate Article X(5) by challenging the measures adopted by EU authorities in relation to Banco Popular before the CJEU.56\n\nReply, paras. 382-390; C-PHB1, paras. 320-323; C-PHB2, paras. 199-200.\n\nReply, para. 367 referring to **Exh.

Un inversor contendiente podr\u00e1 someter una reclamaci\u00f3n a arbitraje \u00fanicamente si: [...]\n\nb) el inversor renuncia a su derecho de iniciar o continuar cualquier procedimiento ante un tribunal administrativo o judicial de conformidad con la legislaci\u00f3n de una Parte Contratante u otros procedimientos de soluci\u00f3n de controversias con respecto a la medida de la Parte Contratante contendiente que constituya un supuesto incumplimiento de una obligaci\u00f3n de este Acuerdo, salvo los procedimientos en los que se solicite la aplicaci\u00f3n de medidas precautorias de car\u00e1cter suspensivo, declarativo o extraordinario, que no impliquen da\u00f1os, ante un tribunal administrativo o judicial, de conformidad con la legislaci\u00f3n de la Parte Contratante contendiente. [...]\"\n\n244.\n\nArticle X(7) which is also pertinent to this objection, provides that:\n\n\"7. El consentimiento y la renuncia requeridos por este Art\u00edculo deber\u00e1n manifestarse por escrito, ser entregados a la Parte Contratante contendiente e incluidos en el sometimiento de la reclamaci\u00f3n a arbitraje.\"\n\n245.\n\nIn their English version, these provisions read as follows:\n\n\"5. A disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration only if: [...] (b) the investor waives his right to initiate or continue any proceedings before an administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party or other dispute settlement procedures in respect of the measure by the disputing Contracting Party that constitutes an alleged failure to comply with an obligation under this Agreement, with the exception of procedures requesting the application of declarative or extraordinary precautionary measures having a suspensive effect, which do not involve the payment of damages, before an administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of the disputing Contracting Party. [...]\n\n7. The consent and the waiver required by this article shall be expressed in writing, transmitted to the disputing Contracting Party and included in the submission of the claim to arbitration.\"\n\n246.\n\nThe Treaty must be interpreted in accordance with the rules on treaty interpretation that are enshrined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VLCT\"). According to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The starting point of the interpretation is the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text. The latter must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty\u2019s object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties.58\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT.\n\n247.\n\nStarting with the text of Article X(5), the *chapeau* makes it clear that submitting a waiver is a mandatory requirement (\"A disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration *only if,* emphasis added). The content of the waiver is then described in letter (b) of Article X(5). Specifically, an investor must waive its right to initiate and continue proceedings of two types: (i) proceedings \"before an administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party\", which clearly refer to domestic court proceedings, and (ii) \"other dispute settlement procedures\", which are not restricted to those \"in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party\" and thus may include non-domestic proceedings (for instance, international arbitration proceedings). Importantly, both (i) and (ii) are qualified by the requirement that they be \"in respect of the measure *by the disputing Contracting Party* that constitutes an alleged failure to comply with an obligation under this Agreement\" (emphasis added). This is only logical as the waiver provision seeks to prevent parallel proceedings against a respondent in relation to the same measure *by that respondent* brought in different fora (for instance, before an international arbitral tribunal and the respondent\u2019s domestic courts, or in two different international arbitration mechanisms which the Treaty offers as options).\n\n248.\n\nArticle X(5)(b) then provides an exception for provisional measures before domestic courts. Although the English translation is arguably less clear on this point, the Spanish original leaves no room for doubts as it refers to \"los procedimientos *en los que se solicite la aplicaci\u00f3n de medidas precautorias* de car\u00e1cter suspensivo, declarativo o extraordinario [...]\" (emphasis added). This exception, which is typically provided in waiver clauses in IIAs, gives the investor access to possibly urgently needed protection, without entailing the risks common to multiple proceedings about the same measures, such as inconsistent decisions, multiple recovery and waste of resources.\n\n249.\n\nIn terms of form, Article X(7) requires that the waiver be (i) \"expressed in writing\", (ii) \"transmitted to the disputing Contracting Party\" and \"included in the submission of the claim to arbitration\". Other than those requirements, the Treaty does not prescribe any particular form. For instance, it does not require that the waiver contain the words used in Article X(5) of the Treaty. Absent such indication, the Tribunal considers that a waiver complies with Article X(5) if, irrespective of the words used or omitted, it substantively conforms to each of the elements of Article X(5) set out above and does not seek to limit the scope of the waiver provided by the Treaty, through exceptions or carve-outs. In other words, substance prevails over form as long as the waiver complies with each of the requirements enumerated by the Treaty.\n\n250.\n\nWith these principles in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the two questions before it, i.e., first, whether the Claimants\u2019 NOA Waiver and/or Side Letters complied with Article X(5) and, second, whether by initiating the CJEU Proceeding the Claimants violated the Treaty.\n\n251.\n\nStarting with the first question, the Tribunal notes that the Notice of Arbitration included waivers both in the text of the Notice (referred to above as the \"NOA Waiver\") and as appendices (the so-called \"Side Letters\"). Both the NOA Waiver and the Side Letters were \"expressed in writing\", \"transmitted to the disputing Contracting Party\", and \"included in the submission of the claim to arbitration\", i.e. the Notice of Arbitration. Article X(7) is thus complied with. The question is whether the text of such waivers complies with the content requirements set out in Article X(5).\n\n252.\n\nThe NOA Waiver reads as follow:\n\n\"Claimants also satisfy the conditions precedent to the submission of a claim under the Treaty. Pursuant to Article X(5)(a) of the Treaty, Claimants consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the Treaty. Claimants also waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of a Party or other dispute settlement procedures in respect of the measures by Respondent that constitutes an alleged failure to comply with the Treaty, with the exception of procedures requesting the application of declarative or extraordinary or precautionary measures having a suspensive effect, which do not involve the payment of damages. The written consent and waiver required by Article X(5)(b) is included with this Notice of Arbitration as Appendix CRFA-C and shall be delivered to Respondent.72\n\n72 Letter of consent and waiver of rights of Claimants pursuant to Article X(5) of the Treaty is attached hereto as **Appendix CRFA-C.\"**\n\nRejoinder, para. 645.\n\n253.\n\nFor their part, the two Side Letters, issued in connection with each of the UNCITRAL and ICSID proceedings (which were subsequently consolidated), contain the following wording:\n\nIn accordance with Article X(5)(b), the [Banco Popular] Investors hereby waive their rights to initiate or continue any proceeding before an administrative or judicial tribunal or other dispute settlement mechanism under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain, with the exception of procedures requesting the application of declarative or extraordinary precautionary measures having a suspensive effect, which do not involve the payment of damages.\"\n\n254.\n\nNeither the NOA Waiver nor the Side Letters mirror *exactly* the wording of Article X(5). Yet, as observed above, there is no requirement in the Treaty that the text of Article X(5) be replicated *verbatim.* In application of the principles set out above, the Tribunal finds that none of the deviations from the Treaty text that are found in the NOA Waiver and Side Letters have any meaningful consequence on the validity of the waiver, and hence on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims.\n\n255.\n\nFirst, in the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants waive[d] their right to initiate or continue before any administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of a Party or other dispute settlement procedures in respect of the measures by Respondent that constitutes an alleged failure to comply with the Treaty\". The Tribunal notes that the words \"any proceedings\" is missing between \"continue\" and \"before\". This appears to be a typographical error as opposed to a deliberate omission, as grammatically the sentence does not make sense without the object. This is confirmed by the text of the Side Letters, which *do* refer to \"any proceeding\". The omission of the word \"any proceedings\" in the NOA Waiver is thus inconsequential, as one cannot see what else an investor could waive initiating or continuing \"before any administrative or judicial tribunal\". The other textual differences in the NOA Waiver are equally insubstantial. For instance, the references in the NOA Waiver to \"any administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of a Party\" (rather than to *\"an* administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of one *Contracting* Party\") or to \"other dispute settlement procedures in respect of the measures by Respondent that constitutes *an alleged failure to comply with the Treaty* (rather than \"[...] an alleged failure to comply with *an obligation* under this Agreement\") are merely stylistic variations without any effect in terms of meaning.\n\n256.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, through the NOA Waiver, either read alone or in combination with the Side Letters, the Claimants provided the waiver required under Article X(5) of the Treaty if they wished to start arbitration, as they gave up their right to initiate or continue domestic and other proceedings in respect of the Respondent\u2019s measures that are alleged to constitute a Treaty breach. Contrary to other cases in which arbitral tribunals have found the wording of waivers to be non-compliant with the terms of the applicable treaty,59 the Claimants did not seek to qualify or limit the waiver through carve-outs or reservation of rights which would be incompatible with the Treaty\u2019s terms as interpreted in good faith in accordance with their ordinary meaning in their context and in light of their object and purpose.\n\nFor instance, in *Renco v. Peru,* the claimants submitted a waiver, containing a carve-out enabling them to pursue claims in another forum *in the event the tribunal had declined to hear its claims on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds.* See **Exh. RL-0088,** The *Renco Group v. Republic of Peru,* Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 15 July 2016, paras. 79-81. In *Waste Management v. Mexico,* the claimant made additional statements to the waiver to invoke failure to comply with duties imposed by other sources of law, including the municipal law of the respondent. See **Exh. RL-0157,** *Waste Management v. Mexico,* ICSID Case ARB(AF)/98/2, Award, 2 June 2000, paras. 27, 31.\n\n257.\n\nThis being said, one issue remains to be addressed in respect of the NOA Waiver and the Side Letters. As recalled above, the waiver provision in the Treaty makes an exception for provisional measures before domestic courts. The NOA Waiver and the Side Letters do mention the exception, however omitting that such provisional relief is to be requested \"before an administrative or judicial tribunal in accordance with the legislation of the disputing Contracting Party\", as required by the Treaty. The effect of this omission may be to broaden the scope of the exception beyond domestic remedies to encompass *any* \"procedures requesting the application of declarative or extraordinary precautionary measures having a suspensive effect, which do not involve the payment of damages\", which is the wording used by the Claimants which in this case replicates the English unofficial translation of the Treaty. While the Tribunal finds the lack of reference to domestic courts in the relevant part of the NOA Waiver or Side Letters regrettable, on balance it considers that, regardless of such omissions, the Claimants could not have intended to refer to any \"precautionary\" (i.e., provisional or interim) relief other than the one that may be requested before domestic courts. This being so, the Tribunal considers that this omission is not fatal to the Claimants\u2019 compliance with the terms of Article X(5).\n\n258.\n\nIn sum, the NOA Waiver, whether read in isolation or in combination with the Side Letters, complied with the requirements of the Treaty.\n\n259.\n\nThe second question is whether by actually initiating and continuing proceedings before the CJEU the Claimants breached Article X(5) of the Treaty. It is undisputed that the factual background that gave rise to this dispute, as will be further described in the subsequent sections of this Award (in particular those relating to liability), involved the conduct of both the EU and Spanish authorities. The delimitation of the responsibilities between the Respondent and the EU authorities is a question that will be addressed later in this Award. For present purposes, it is sufficient to observe that Article X(5) only requires a disputing investor to waive its right to initiate or continue proceedings before \"other dispute settlement procedures in respect of the measure *by the disputing Contracting Party* that constitutes an alleged failure to comply with an obligation under this Agreement\" (emphasis added).\n\n260.\n\nIn other words, for the waiver to operate in respect of \"other dispute settlement procedures\" (which in the abstract could encompass proceedings before the CJEU), the impugned measure in both the arbitration and the \"other dispute settlement procedure\" must be a measure taken *by the Respondent.* In this arbitration, the Claimants challenge the *Respondent\u2019s* measures as being contrary to Spain\u2019s obligations under the Treaty and do not seek to impugn the EU authorities\u2019 conduct under EU law. Conversely, before the CJEU, the only respondents are the European Commission and the SRB, not the Kingdom of Spain, and those authorities were sought to be held liable under EU law for their own conduct.60 It suffices to review the Claimants\u2019 application before the CJEU to conclude that the Claimants\u2019 \"pleas\" (as they are called in that submission) in the CJEU Proceeding are directed solely against the EU in connection with acts of EU institutions. Specifically, in the CJEU Proceeding, the Claimants submitted pleas in connection with the alleged unlawfulness of the SRM Regulation adopted by the EU Parliament and the Council (pleas nos. 1 and 9 in the Claimants\u2019 Application before the CJEU).61 They also filed numerous pleas according to which the *SRB* and the *European Commission,* through their decision or conduct, \"infringed Articles 41, 47 and 48 of the EU Charter\", \"infringed, without justification or proportion, the Applicants\u2019 right to property\", \"infringed Article 20 of the SRM Regulation by failing to undertake a proper and independent valuation prior to taking the Contested Decisions\", \"infringed Article 18(1) of the SRM Regulation in determining that the conditions precedent set out under Articles 18(1)(a) and (b) were satisfied\", \"infringed Article 21(1) of the SRM Regulation in determining that the conditions for the exercise of the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments were satisfied\", \"breached an essential procedural requirement by failing to provide an adequate statement of reasons for the Contested Decisions\", \"failed to comply with (a) the principle of proportionality; and (b) the legitimate expectations of the Applicants by departing from the resolution plan without justification\".62\n\nSee **Exh. CL-107,** *Mr. Antonio del Valle Ruiz and Others v. the SRB, the European Commission,* Application lodged pursuant to Articles 263 and 277 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 86 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (Case T-510/17).

Indeed, the Court summarized the applicants\u2019 claim in the following terms:\n\n\"The applicants claim that the Court should:\n\n- annul the resolution scheme and Decision 2017/1246 (together, 'the contested decisions\u2019);\n\n- order the SRB and the Commission to pay the costs.\"64\n\nSee **Exh. RL-0423,** Decision by the General Court of the CJEU in case *Antonio del Valle Ruiz and others v. European Commission and SRB* (Case T-510/17), 1 June 2022. The Parties were given an opportunity to comment on the CJEU Decision. See Respondent\u2019s letter, 11 July 2022; Claimants\u2019 letter, 29 July 2022.\n\n**Exh. RL-0423,** CJEU Decision, para. 99.\n\n262.\n\nThe \"resolution scheme\" and Decision 2017/1246 referred to by the Court as the \"contested decisions\" are, respectively, Decision SRB/EES/2017/08 *adopted by the Executive Session of the SRB* on 7 June 201765 and Decision 2017/1246 *adopted by the European Commission* on the same date.66 The Court examined the applicants\u2019 \"pleas\" directed against the EU in connection with acts of EU institutions under EU law and did not scrutinize any acts or omissions of Spanish authorities in connection with Banco Popular\u2019s resolution. The CJEU Decision thus provides further confirmation that the CJEU Proceeding does not fall within the purview of Article X(5).\n\n**Exh. RL-0423,** CJEU Decision, para. 68 (\"[o]n 7 June 2017, the Executive Session of the SRB adopted Decision SRB/EES/2017/08 concerning a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular ('the resolution scheme\u2019) on the basis of Regulation No 806/2014\").\n\n**Exh. RL-0423,** CJEU Decision, para. 78.\n\n263.\n\nIn summary, in the CJEU Proceeding, the Claimants did not seek to impugn the Respondent\u2019s conduct or, in other words, the CJEU Proceeding is not a dispute settlement procedure in respect of measures *taken by Spain* that are alleged to have breached an obligation under the Treaty.\n\n264.\n\nTherefore, the pursuit of the CJEU Proceeding does not fall within the purview of Article X(5) and has thus no consequence on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over this dispute or the admissibility of the claims.\n\n265.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent\u2019s objections in connection to Article X(5) of the Treaty are denied.\n\n**2. Fork-in-the-Road**\n-----------------------\n\n**a.** ***The Respondent\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nSpain contends that Article X(1) of the Treaty (the \"fork-in-the-road provision\") prohibits foreign investors from raising claims in different fora, if the fundamental basis of such claims is identical.67 The Claimants thus allegedly violated this provision by challenging the measures related to the resolution of Banco Popular both before the CJEU and this Tribunal.68 Despite acknowledging that the applicable laws and the *petita* are different in the two proceedings, Spain is of the view that the claims are fundamentally identical.69 Specifically, Spain argues that the Claimants requested the CJEU to declare that they had suffered a deprivation of their property, which would be identical to the expropriation claim raised in this arbitration.70\n\nRejoinder, paras. 641-642, referring to **Exh.

This might create a risk of double recovery.71 Finally, Spain suggests that the Claimants\u2019 initiation of two proceedings about the same measures to seek to compensate the same damage is an abuse of process.72\n\nSoD, para. 559.\n\n**b.** ***The Claimants\u2019 position***\n------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimants dispute having breached Article X(1) of the Treaty.73\n\nResponse to the Trifurcation Request, paras. 34-43; Reply, paras. 391-404; C-PHB1, paras. 321-322; C-PHB2, para. 200.\n\n269.\n\nFirst, in the Claimants\u2019 submission, Article X(1) does not apply here. This provision only comes into play when two conditions are met: (i) an investor sues a State in different fora; and (ii) the claims in the different fora involve the State\u2019s failure to comply with the Treaty. These requirements are not fulfilled here, because in this arbitration the Claimants are suing Spain for alleged breaches of the Treaty, while in the CJEU Proceeding they are seeking to hold the European Commission and the SRB accountable for breaches of EU law.74\n\nReply, para. 393.\n\n270.\n\nSecond, Article X(1) does not preclude the CJEU Proceeding and this arbitration from running in parallel. The Claimants advocate for the application of the triple identity test, meaning that the fork-in-the-road provision only prohibits claims involving the same parties, the same legal basis and the same relief. They observe that this test has found broader application75 than the fundamental basis test proposed by Spain.76 In the Claimants\u2019 view, this arbitration and the CJEU Proceeding do not satisfy the triple identity test, because they involve different parties, causes of action and relief.77\n\nReply, para. 396, referring to **Exh.

ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, para. 67.\n\nReply, paras. 399-401.\n\n271.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent's position implies that an investor cannot \"be made whole for their losses where multiple actors (i.e. a Respondent State and the EU authorities) carried out different acts that independently caused harm to an investor\",78 which would not make sense and be patently unfair.\n\nReply, para. 388.\n\n**c.** ***Analysis***\n---------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe fork-in-the-road clause embodied in Article X(1) reads as follows:\n\n\"An investor who alleges before a judicial or administrative tribunal that the Contracting Party has failed to comply with an obligation under this Agreement may not submit a claim in accordance with this Section. Nor may an investor submit a claim in accordance with this Section on behalf of an enterprise if that enterprise alleges before a judicial or administrative tribunal that the Contacting Party has failed to comply with an obligation under this Agreement.\"\n\n273.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of this clause is straightforward. For it to apply so that an investor \"may not submit a claim\" under the Treaty, the investor must have (i) started proceedings \"before a judicial or administrative tribunal\" and (ii) alleged in those proceedings that \"the *Contracting Party* has failed to comply with *an obligation under this Agreement.* Accordingly, Article X(1) mandates that the submission in the other proceedings involve an allegation that one of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty has breached an obligation set out in the Treaty. The rule manifestly does not apply when the investor alleges before a judicial or administrative court that other entities or institutions have breached different types of obligations.\n\n274.\n\nWith that in mind, the Tribunal may be relatively brief as the analysis is not materially different from the one carried out in connection with the waiver. Indeed, as explained above by reference to the complaints launched before the CJEU, in the CJEU Proceeding the Claimants did not allege that *the Respondent* failed to comply with *an obligation under the Treaty.* Rather, their complaints were solely directed at the European authorities (in particular the SRB and the European Commission) for alleged violations of EU law, as confirmed also by the CJEU Decision (see *supra* paras. 261-262). This being so, the Claimants\u2019 prior initiation of the CJEU Proceeding has clearly not triggered the fork-in-the-road provision in Article X(1) of the Treaty.\n\n275.\n\nAs a result of these conclusions, the Tribunal can dispense with entering into the Parties\u2019 further arguments on the applicability of the triple identity test in the context of fork-in-the-road provisions or on the fundamental basis of the claim test. This being so, it emphasizes that it reaches its conclusion based on the text of the Treaty\u2019s fork-in-the-road clause. Consequently, it does not purport to make findings on fork-in-the-road clauses in other investment treaties nor on the application of the so-called \"triple identity\" or \"fundamental basis\" tests.\n\n276.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Article X(1) of the Treaty has not been triggered and, therefore, its jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims have not been affected by the Claimants\u2019 initiation of the CJEU Proceeding. The Respondent\u2019s fork-in-the-road objection is accordingly rejected.\n\n277.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that in two short paragraphs of the Rejoinder, the Respondent argued that the Claimants\u2019 initiation of multiple proceedings also amounted to an abuse of process. The threshold for a finding of an abuse of process is high.79 The Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not sufficiently substantiated, let alone proven, that the Claimants\u2019 pursuit of the CJEU Proceeding and this arbitration constituted an abuse under that high threshold. The Respondent\u2019s abuse of process objection is thus equally denied.\n\nSee, e.g., **Exh. RL-0002,** *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Australia,* PCA Case No. 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, para. 539 (\"[a]s a preliminary matter, it is clear, and recognised by all earlier decisions that the threshold for finding an abusive initiation of an investment claim is high\").\n\n**B.** **Whether the measures challenged by the Claimants fall within the scope of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Mexico and Spain are the only Contracting Parties to the Treaty. Consequently, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to acts performed by these States and does not extend to acts carried out by third parties, specifically acts of the EU institutions (a) and Spanish public entities (b).80\n\nRequest for Trifurcation, paras. 50-76; SoD, paras. 561-596; Rejoinder, paras. 648-669; R-PHB1, paras. 18-19; R-PHB2, paras. 6-8.\n\n**a.** ***Acts of EU authorities***\n-----------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nSpain argues that the Claimants incorrectly attribute to it measures adopted by the EU, for instance (i) the prudential supervision and the resolution of Banco Popular; (ii) Dr. Elke K\u00f6nig\u2019s statement of 31 May 2017; and (iii) the failure to make public statements supporting Banco Popular.81 In support, Spain gives the following explanations:\n\n\u2022 The ECB was exclusively responsible for supervising Banco Popular. Consequently, the resolution of Banco Popular is not attributable to Spain;82\n\n\u2022 Dr. Elke K\u00f6nig is an official of the EU, with the result that her statements and their effect on the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment cannot be imputed to Spain;\n\n\u2022 The ECB is solely responsible for making public statements of support in relation to the banks it supervises. Accordingly, the alleged failure to publicly support Banco Popular must be imputed to the ECB rather than to Spain.\n\nSoD, paras. 569-570; Rejoinder, paras. 652-656; R-PHB1, paras.18-19; R-PHB2, para. 7.\n\nSoD, paras. 568-577, 579, referring to Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party submitted by the European Commission, 10 October 2019, para. 12; RER-1, para. 53; CER-2, para. 1.4.

Spain disputes being obliged to prevent such withdrawals or having coordinated them.85 The conduct of the public sector entities in the management and subsequent withdrawal of deposits \"amounts therefore to *iur[e] gestionis* acts that cannot, by their nature, represent a breach of the Treaty in the manner [i]n which [the Claimants] [h]ave built their claim\".86 These acts must thus \"be excluded from this dispute\".87\n\nSoD, paras. 585-596; Rejoinder, paras. 668-669; R-PHB1, para. 20; R-PHB2, para. 8.\n\nSoD, para. 595.\n\nSoD, para. 596.\n\n**2.

In respect of the first, the Claimants contend that they are attributable to Spain under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, as FROB and CNMC form part of the Spanish Government.93 As to the second category of withdrawals, the Claimants do not attribute them to the Respondent. Rather they accuse Spain, specifically the Government, the Minister of Economy and Bank of Spain,94 of failing \"to do anything to stop its own entities from withdrawing billions of euros in deposits which it knew would severely impact the bank\".95\n\nReply, para. 457-468; C-PHB1, paras. 324-327; C-PHB2, paras. 201-202.\n\nSee Reply, para. 460 referring **to Exh.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n285.\n\nIt is Spain\u2019s contention that (i) the acts of EU authorities and (ii) the deposit withdrawals by the so-called public entities fall outside the scope of the Treaty as they are not acts of the Respondent or conduct that can be attributed to it. The Tribunal takes the two prongs of Spain\u2019s objection in turn.\n\n286.\n\nWith respect to the acts of the EU authorities, there can be no doubt that the Treaty only binds the two State Contracting Parties. Hence, the Tribunal has jurisdiction only with respect to acts *of Spain* (provided of course they are relevant to this dispute). As the EU is not a Party to the Treaty, the Tribunal obviously has no jurisdiction over acts of EU authorities. As already noted above in connection with the waiver and fork-in-the-road objections, in this arbitration the Claimants have advanced their claims against Spain, not the EU. While it is true that the Claimants\u2019 pleadings contain references to a number of acts of the EU authorities, this is not surprising as EU Member States and the EU share competences in the European Banking System. The acts of EU authorities thus form part of the factual background which the Tribunal may consider when assessing whether *the Respondent* breached the Treaty. The allocation of competences between Spain and the EU in areas pertinent to this dispute are thus matters that are relevant to the merits and will be further assessed in that context. However, by examining facts which involve the acts of EU institutions, the Tribunal is in no way asserting jurisdiction over EU authorities or their conduct.\n\n287.\n\nIn respect of the deposit withdrawals by entities to which the Claimants refer as \"public entities\", the issues are somewhat different. As specified in the Reply, the claims regarding the withdrawals of deposit have two dimensions:96\n\n\u2022 First, the Claimants complain of the very acts of withdrawal by \"numerous agencies of the Spanish government\"97 or \"Spanish public entities\"98 (among which the Claimants expressly identify the Entidad P\u00fablica Empresarial Red Espa\u00f1ola,99 Adif Alta Velocidad,100 Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Canarias,101 the FROB,102 the CNMV,103 Sareb,104 Tesorer\u00eda General Seguridad Social (TGSS), Sociedad Estatal de Loter\u00edas y Apuestas del Estado (SELAE),105 and Fondo Nacional de Eficiencia Energ\u00e9tica);106\n\n\u2022 Second, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s organs who had the \"obligation to maintain the financial stability of the system\" (including 'the central government, the Minister of Economy, and the [Bank of Spain]\u2019) failed \"to do anything to stop its own entities from withdrawing billions of euros in deposits which it knew would severely impact the bank\".107\n\nSee Reply, paras. 115-120.\n\nReply, para. 116.\n\nReply, para. 118.\n\nReply, paras. 118-119.\n\nReply, paras. 118-119.\n\nReply, paras. 118-119.\n\nReply, paras. 118-119.\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\nReply, para. 462.\n\n288.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants claim that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\"), expropriation, and non-discrimination standards by (i) withdrawing \"billions of Euros from Banco Popular\"108 *and* by (ii) failing to resort to what the Claimants consider were regulatory tools at the Respondent\u2019s disposal that could have stopped the deposit withdrawals109 (e.g., failure \"to order the suspension of deposit withdrawals in order to safeguard the stability of the banking system\",110 to make public statements,111 and to issue a short sale ban).112\n\nSee SoC, paras. 26 (arguing that the Respondent breached FET by its continuous and unprecedented withdrawal of billions of Euros from Banco Popular), 28 (Respondent expropriated Claimants\u2019 investments in Banco Popular by destroying the value of those investments\" through conduct that included \"withdrawal of billions of Euros in deposits\"), 343 (contending that the Respondent took discriminatory conduct by, *inter alia,* \"continuing to withdraw government deposits from Banco Popular despite the knowledge that such withdrawals were worsening Banco Popular's liquidity crisis, while it adopted different conduct with regard to other banks); Reply, paras. 680 h. (\"Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions, described above, fundamentally breached the FET standard on so many levels: [...]Respondent\u2019s continued massive deposit withdrawals in 2017 despite the knowledge of [Banco Popular]\u2019s solvency and its weakening liquidity position\"), 754 ff. (arguing that \"[t]he deposit withdrawals [...]constituted part of the creeping expropriation), 772; C-PHB1, para. 213 (Respondent\u2019s creeping expropriation began with massive government withdrawals [...]); para. 64 (\"Respondent\u2019s deposit withdrawals violate Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations that Respondent would \"do no harm\" to their investment\"); C-PHB2, para. 24.\n\nSee SoC, para. 125 (\"Respondent did nothing to stop the outflow of deposits, principally driven by its own entities\"); Reply, para. 575 (The [Bank of Spain] should have alerted Spanish authorities about the excessive withdrawals from public authorities and then considered all possible means to strengthen [Banco Popular]\u2019s deposit holdings\").\n\nReply, para. 561.\n\nReply, paras. 134 (\"Respondent never made a single public statement telling [Banco Popular]'s depositors that there was no need to withdraw their deposits, that their deposits were safe and that there was no need [for] any depositor concern, which Mr. Manso Olivar points out could have been done\"), 811 (\"In the present case, Respondent failed to make strong statements of support for [Banco Popular], standing by and watching as the bank\u2019s deposits were withdrawn in a panic, including massive withdrawals by the government itself\").\n\nReply, para. 138 (\"a short sale ban is one of the numerous supervisory tools that Respondent had at its disposal to stop the manic drop in share price and deposit withdrawals in [Banco Popular] during the weeks and months leading to its resolution\").\n\n289.\n\nIn its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent predominantly insists on the first facet of the claim,113 and contends that because \"the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to breaches of the BIT, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over conduct that cannot *prima facie* amount to breaches of the BIT\".114 In Spain\u2019s view, the public deposit withdrawals cannot be attributable to Spain and therefore cannot constitute treaty breaches.\n\nIn respect of the second facet, the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 attempt to invoke *'Respondent's failure to do anything to stop its own entities from withdrawing billions of euros in deposits'* fails to establish that the Kingdom of Spain had the power to do so, let alone that such an obligation existed in the first place\". See Rejoinder, para. 669.\n\nRejoinder, para. 668.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to \"[a]ny dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party *due to alleged non-compliance with an obligation under this Agreement'*115The dispute settlement clause thus focuses on the second element for State responsibility, i.e. the existence of a breach of an international obligation as opposed to attribution, which is the first element.116 Accordingly, it limits the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to disputes in connection with alleged breaches of a Treaty obligation. As a result, at the jurisdictional level, the Tribunal must satisfy itself that the conduct that is alleged is *prima facie* capable of constituting a breach of the Treaty. Therefore, at this stage the relevant question is whether the impugned acts, i.e. the deposit withdrawals, can potentially trigger a breach of a *primary rule,* not whether such acts are attributable to the State (which, if the acts in question pass the jurisdictional hurdle, is a matter best addressed at the merits).\n\nSee **Exh. C-1,** Treaty, Article IX (emphasis added), dealing with the obligation to notify the dispute, and Article XI, entitled \"Referral to Arbitration\", which cross-references the same notification (\"[p]rovided that six months have elapsed since the notification referred to in article IX, the disputing investor may submit the claim to arbitration in accordance with [...]\").\n\nSee **Exh. CL-50,** ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 2, which lists the \"[e]lements of an internationally wrongful act of a State\" and provides that [t]here is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law; and (b) *constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State* (emphasis added).\n\n291.\n\nThe primary rules which serve as the source of the obligation at issue here (the FET, expropriation and non-discrimination standards alleged to be violated) require that the acts of a Contracting Party be carried out in the exercise of sovereign powers in order to trigger a potential Treaty breach.117 Indeed, as a general rule, the substantive standards of investment treaties are intended to protect investors from sovereign risks, not commercial risks.118\n\nSee *Carlos R\u00edos and Francisco Rios v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/17/16, Award, 11 January 2021, paras. 259 (\"[d]ado el texto del Tratado y tomando en cuenta la jurisprudencia internacional en materia de naturaleza del acto del Estado, el Tribunal entiende que la medida debe ser soberana, y no meramente contractual. Este requisito habr\u00eda sido aplicable aun si el Tratado no lo hubiese dicho expresamente. En efecto, est\u00e1 bien establecido que, excepto en casos de aplicaci\u00f3n de ciertas cl\u00e1usulas conocidas como 'paraguas,\u2019 para comprometer la responsabilidad internacional del Estado por la violaci\u00f3n de un tratado de inversi\u00f3n el Estado debe haber actuado en ejercicio de prerrogativas soberanas, y no como parte en una relaci\u00f3n contractual. La raz\u00f3n es que, como regla general, los est\u00e1ndares sustantivos de los tratados de inversi\u00f3n tienen por objeto proteger a los inversionistas de riesgos soberanos y no riesgos comerciales. As\u00ed, s\u00f3lo pueden considerarse como expropiatorias aquellas medidas estatales que frustren un contrato en que el Estado sea parte y que constituyan el ejercicio de potestades exorbitantes del Estado.

La situaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda ser distinta en caso de que una cl\u00e1usula paraguas fuese aplicable, pero ese no es el caso aqu\u00ed\", internal footnote omitted).\n\nIbid.\n\n292.\n\nWith this clarification in mind, the Tribunal examines the two prongs of the claims regarding the deposit withdrawals. Starting with the first, i.e. the allegation that the very acts of the Spanish public entities withdrawing deposits were unlawful, the Tribunal is of the view that these withdrawals were plainly acts which the entities in question took in the exercise of their rights under their private law deposit contracts with Banco Popular, like any bank client acting in a commercial capacity. These are manifestly *not* acts that involve the exercise of sovereign powers. In this respect, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have not established, not even on a *prima facie* basis for purposes of jurisdiction, how the act of withdrawing one\u2019s own money deposited in a bank under a private law contract could constitute a breach of the Treaty. Those acts are thus not capable of constituting Treaty breaches and therefore disputes arising out of such acts are outside of the Tribunal\u2019s *ratione materiae* jurisdiction.\n\n293.\n\nIn the context of the second prong of the claim regarding the deposit withdrawals, the Claimants allege that the Respondent breached the Treaty standards by not exercising its regulatory powers for the protection of financial stability in such a manner as to prevent those withdrawals. If it were established that the Respondent was required to prevent the withdrawals, then the failure to do so could potentially constitute a Treaty breach, with the result that such alleged breach falls within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Said otherwise, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider whether the Respondent failed to exercise its regulatory powers in matters of financial stability, which are sovereign powers, in breach of the Treaty standards. Whether the Respondent actually breached the Treaty is a matter for the merits and will be addressed in that context.\n\n294.\n\nIn summary, and subject to the limitations regarding the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *temporis* discussed below, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims about the deposit withdrawals to the extent that they concern acts or omissions taken by the Respondent in the exercise of sovereign powers.\n\n**C.** **Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nSpain argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and has advanced numerous arguments why the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments are not protected under the Treaty. These arguments are summarized in this section.\n\n296.\n\nIt is Spain\u2019s position that the Treaty does not protect indirect investments.119 The Respondent observes that such investments are not expressly included in the scope of the Treaty.120 The mere inclusion of shares in Article l(4) does not mean that all types of indirect investments are protected.121 On the contrary, the Treaty requires a *direct* link between an investor and his or her investment.122 Spain acknowledges that the Treaty does grant protection to indirect investments under Articles X(2)-(3), but that protection is limited and the Claimants cannot benefit from it, as they have no control over Banco Popular.123\n\nSoD, paras. 597-625; Rejoinder, paras. 692-751; R-PHB1, paras. 21-25; R-PHB2, paras. 9-13.\n\nSoD, paras. 598-601; Rejoinder, 692-705; R-PHB1, paras. 21-25; R-PHB2, paras. 9-13.\n\nRejoinder, para. 700.\n\nSoD, para. 602; Rejoinder, para. 705.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 695-699.\n\n297.\n\nSpain argues that its position is reinforced by other provisions of the Treaty, specifically those related to the substantive protection of foreign investments,124 as they apply only to \"investments of investors\".125\n\nSoD, paras. 677-684. Spain refers to the following provisions: (i) Article II (promotion and admission of investments); (ii) Article III (national treatment); (iii) Article III (MFN treatment); (iv) Article IV (minimum standard of treatment); and (v) Article IX (freedom of transfers).\n\nSoD, para. 614.\n\n298.\n\nMoreover, if Spain and Mexico had intended to protect indirect investments, they would have opted for wording similar to Spain\u2019s BIT with Kuwait or Jordan. These treaties define investment as any asset owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor.126\n\nSoD, para. 603, referring to **Exh. RL-0239,** Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the State of Kuwait for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 8 September 2005, Article 1(1); **Exh. RL-0240,** Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 20 October 1999, Article 1(2).\n\n299.\n\nFurther, Spain submits that the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments lack any territorial nexus with the host country.127 The Claimants held their shares in Banco Popular passively through various intermediary companies and trusts and, consequently, lacked ownership or control over their shares.128 In Spain\u2019s view, the Claimants\u2019 argument that they were required to hold shares through intermediaries under Mexican law is irrelevant for determining the type of investment protected under the Treaty.129\n\nSoD, paras. 602, 614; Rejoinder, para. 690; R-PHB1, para. 22.\n\nSoD, paras. 615-625; Rejoinder, paras. 718-734; R-PHB1, paras. 21-24; R-PHB2, para. 12.

See also R-PHB2, para. 11.\n\n300.\n\nIn any event, so Spain contends, reflective loss claims are prohibited under international law, so the Claimants cannot claim damages for the harm suffered by Banco Popular.130\n\nSoD, para. 613, referring to **Exh.

The risk was therefore not borne by the Claimants themselves and, in any event, was confined to the potential loss of those initial amounts, which is the ordinary commercial or business risk borne by all those who trade in shares and securities of publicly listed companies at the secondary market\".137\n\nSoD, paras. 626-634; Rejoinder, paras. 670-691.\n\nSoD, para. 632; Rejoinder, para. 677.\n\nRejoinder, para. 677.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 680-682.\n\nRejoinder, para. 680 (internal footnote omitted).\n\nRejoinder, para. 683, discussing **Exh.

Although both Mexico and Spain entered into treaties with third states that expressly include indirect investments, these treaties are without relevance here.140\n\nReply, paras. 335-357; C-PHB1, paras. 328-348; C-PHB 2, paras. 203-207.\n\nReply, para. 303, referring to **Exh.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, para. 162.\n\nReply, para. 306, referring to **Exh.

See also C-PHB1, para. 340; C-PHB2, para. 206.\n\n305.\n\nSecond, the Claimants underscore that Article l(4) contains a broad definition of investment, which includes such indirect financial instruments as shares, partnership interest, debt instruments and loans.141 The broad coverage of investments was confirmed *inter alia* in the 2008 Decree promulgating the Treaty.142\n\nReply, para. 275.\n\nReply, para. 277, referring to **Exh. CL-112,** Executive Summary of the Mexico-Spain Treaty, p. 50.\n\n306.\n\nThird, the Treaty contains a number of provisions, which would make no sense should the Treaty not cover indirect investments,143 specifically (i) Article X(3), which allows a foreign investor to submit a claim to arbitration on behalf of an enterprise owned by him or her or under his other direct or indirect control; (ii) Article XIV concerning the consolidation of proceedings; and (iii) Article X(2), which prohibits local enterprises from initiating proceedings against their home State. By contrast, in the Claimants\u2019 submission, the \"other provisions of the treaty\" (MFN, national treatment and FET) that on Spain\u2019s case limit protection to direct investments are irrelevant, as they set out the standards of treatment, as opposed to the types of investors to which such standards apply.144\n\nReply, paras. 286; C-PHB1, paras. 341-342.\n\nReply, para. 301.\n\n307.\n\nFourth, the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article l(4) is in line with Mexican law, because shares and financial instruments listed on international exchanges may only be marketed through authorized broker dealers and banks.145 Moreover, the Claimants posit that, contrary to Spain\u2019s allegations, their investment complies with the requirements of Article l(4):\n\n\u2022 investment has a territorial connection with the host state as it was made in Spain.146 The Claimants\u2019 shareholding in Banco Popular is no different from intangible property and IP rights, which are mentioned in Article l(4) and, consequently, satisfy the territorial requirement;147\n\n\u2022 it is established that the Claimants own and control their shares in Banco Popular, as explained in detail in (i) Annex A to the Statement of Claim; (ii) Annex I to the Reply; and (iii) Annex I to the C-PHB1. The intermediate corporate structures through which they hold their shares do not affect their rights of ownership and control, because these intermediaries can only act upon the Claimants\u2019 instructions. In any event, the fact of ownership is sufficient to satisfy the Treaty requirements;148\n\n\u2022 the Respondent\u2019s reflective loss argument was raised belatedly and in any event, the Claimants do not claim compensation for reflective loss. They seek damages for harm caused to them directly. In any event, the claim for reflective loss is permissible under the Treaty;149\n\n\u2022 an investment does not need to meet requirements other than those provided by the applicable treaty.150 The Claimants refer to decisions of investment tribunals that refused to apply the so-called \"inherent definition of investment\" or *Salini* test in non-ICSID arbitration.151\n\nReply, para. 287, referring to **Exh.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the different aspects of Spain\u2019s objection to *ratione materiae* jurisdiction in the following order: (a) whether the BIT protects \"indirect\" investments; (b) whether the Claimants have shown that each of them owned or controlled their investments; (c) whether the assets allegedly forming part of their investments have the inherent characteristics of an investment; and (d) whether they would be entitled to claim for \"reflective losses\".\n\n**a.** ***Indirect investments***\n---------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nFirst, Spain contends that the Treaty does not cover \"indirect\" investments. Since the Claimants held their shares and bonds in Banco Popular through various intermediaries, such as offshore companies and trusts, they cannot benefit from the protection of the Treaty according to the Respondent.\n\n311.\n\nArticle I(4) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"4. The term \"investment\" shall mean, in particular, the following assets owned or controlled by investors of one of the Contracting Parties and established in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legislation of the latter:\n\n(a) an enterprise;\n\n(b) shares, partnership interests and other forms of participation in the capital of an enterprise;\n\n(c) debt instruments of an enterprise:\n\n(i) when the enterprise is a subsidiary of the investor, or\n\n(ii) when the debt instrument has an original maturity of at least three years, but does not include an obligation of a Contracting Party or a State enterprise, irrespective of the original maturity;\n\n(d) a loan to an enterprise:\n\n(i) when the enterprise is a subsidiary of the investor, or\n\n(ii) when the loan has an original maturity of at least three years, but does not include a loan to a Contracting Party or to a State enterprise, irrespective of the original maturity;\n\n(e) movable or immovable property, as well as mortgages, pledges, usufructs or other tangible or intangible property, including all intellectual and industrial property rights, acquired or used for economic activities or other business purposes;\n\n(f) rights resulting from the contribution of capital or other resources in the territory of one Contracting Party for the development of an economic activity in the territory of the other Contracting Party, including those derived from a contract or concession;\n\nThis definition shall not include any monetary claims arising exclusively from:\n\n(i) Commercial contracts for the sale of property or services by a national or an enterprise in the territory of one Contracting Party to an enterprise in the territory of the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(ii) The granting of credit in relation to a commercial transaction, such as the financing of trade, with the exception of a loan covered by subparagraph (d).\"\n\n312.\n\nArticle l(4) contains a non-exhaustive (\"in particular\") list of \"assets\" that are considered as protected investments under the Treaty. To the extent relevant here, such list includes the following assets:\n\n\u25a0 \"shares, partnership interests and other forms of participation in the capital of an enterprise\" (Article l(4)(b);\n\n\u25a0 \"debt instruments of an enterprise: (i) when the enterprise is a subsidiary of the investor, or (ii) when the debt instrument has an original maturity of at least three years, but does not include an obligation of a Contracting Party or a State enterprise, irrespective of the original maturity and a loan to an enterprise\" (Article l(4)(c));\n\n\u25a0 \"a loan to an enterprise: (i) when the enterprise is a subsidiary of the investor, or (ii) when the loan has an original maturity of at least three years, but does not include a loan to a Contracting Party or to a State enterprise, irrespective of the original maturity\" (Article l(4)(d)).\n\n313.\n\nIt is thus clear that both shares and bonds are captured by the list in Article l(4). The question is whether the Treaty requires an investor to own or control these assets directly, i.e. without the involvement of an intermediate holder.\n\n314.\n\nStarting with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty terms according to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal notes that there is no requirement of direct ownership or control in the language of Article l(4). The provision merely requires that the relevant asset be \"owned or controlled\".\n\n315.\n\nInvestments are often made indirectly. It is indeed not unusual for investors to structure their foreign investments through several corporations for a variety of legal and regulatory reasons. Therefore, the ordinary meaning of the terms \"investment\" or \"invested\" is not restricted to assets which an investor owns or controls directly.156\n\nSee **Exh. CL-287,** *Deutsche Telekom v. India,* PCA Case No. 2014-10, Interim Award, 13 December 2017, para. 142.\n\n316.\n\nTurning then to the context, the Respondent cites several provisions in the Treaty that allegedly support its interpretation that the BIT does not protect indirect investments. For example, the obligations of promotion and admission of investments, national treatment, most-favored nation treatment, minimum standard of treatment and freedom of transfers only apply with respect to \"investments *of* investors\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, none of these provisions imply that investments should be held directly. While the term \"of\" implies an ownership link between investors and investments, such ownership need not necessarily be direct.\n\n317.\n\nSpain also argues that the definition of *investor* in Article l(5) of the Treaty \"adds an additional limitation, as it defines the term 'investor\u2019 in a restrictive manner by requiring that investors 'ha[ve] made an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party\". Spain further specifies that \"[...] the ordinary interpretation of such instrument must be that it is only applicable to 'investors\u2019 who have directly made an 'investment\u2019 in the territory of the Kingdom of Spain\".157\n\nSoD, paras. 601-602.\n\n318.\n\nArticle l(5) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"5. The term \"investors shall mean:\n\n(a) Physical persons who are nationals of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its laws; or\n\n(b) Any enterprise, meaning any legal entity \u2014 including companies, associations of companies, trading corporate entities, branch offices and other organizations \u2014 which is established or, in any case, properly organized in accordance with the law of one of the Contracting Parties and has its head office in the territory of that Contracting Party; which has made an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n319.\n\nIn accordance with Article l(5) *in fine,* in order for a physical person or enterprise to be considered an investor it, first, must have \"made\" an investment and, second, such investment must be \"in the territory of the [host State]\".\n\n320.\n\nNothing in the first part of that formulation requires that the investment be \"made\" directly. In its ordinary meaning, the word \"made\" does not imply that the investment be structured without intermediate companies. As noted above, in practice, investments are often \"made\" indirectly. The second part of Article 1(5) last sentence requires the investment to be \"in the territory\" of the host state. That requirement does not restrict the way in which the investment can be made. It suffices that the result of the investment activity, *i.e.* the relevant assets, be in the territory of the host state. For the sake of completeness, it is noted that the same requirement is contained in Article l(4) of the Treaty requiring the assets to be \"established in the territory of the [host State]\". That provision does not imply a direct investment either.\n\n321.\n\nInvestment tribunals have consistently refused to read the reference to the territory of the host state as a requirement for direct ownership of the assets constituting the investment. For instance, the *CEMEX v. Venezuela* tribunal stated:\n\n\"[W]hen the BIT mentions investments made 'in\u2019 the territory of a Contracting Party, all it requires is that the investment itself be situated in that territory. It does not imply that those investments must be 'directly\u2019 made in such territory.158\n\n*CEMEX Caracas Investments B.V and CEMEX Caracas II Investments B.V v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 December 2010para. 157, cited in **Exh. CL-287,** *Deutsche Telekom v. India,* PCA Case No. 2014-10, Interim Award, 13 December 2017, para. 152; **Exh. CL-216,** *Guaracachi America, Inc. & Rurelec PLC v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia,* UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, para. 356.\n\n322.\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient that the assets invested be situated in Spain. That condition is undoubtedly met as it is common ground that Banco Popular was a company incorporated and existing in Spain.\n\n323.\n\nMoreover, the object and the purpose of the Treaty impose no limitation to directly invested assets. The preamble of the BIT provides that the Contracting Parties wish to \"intensify economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of both countries\", \"create favourable conditions for investments made by either Contracting Party in the territory of the other\", \"stimulate initiatives in this field\". Such objectives can be achieved irrespective of whether an investor carries out his or her economic activities directly or indirectly.\n\n324.\n\nThis interpretation is corroborated by consistent decisions of a number of investment tribunals.159 In *Guaracachi v. Bolivia,* for instance, the tribunal construed an unqualified definition of \"investment\" contained in the UK-Bolivia BIT to \"naturally include 'indirect investments\u2019 through the acquisition of shares in a company\".160 Similarly, in *Siemens v. Argentina,* the tribunal held that \"a literal reading\" of the unqualified definition of \"investment\" in the Argentina-Germany BIT \"does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments\".161\n\n**Exh. CL-201,** *Fedax N. V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, paras. 34-35; *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. and others v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 September 2013, paras. 282-285.\n\n**Exh. CL-216,** *Guaracachi America, Inc. & Rurelec PLC v.

The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/08, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, para. 137.\n\n325.\n\nThe tribunal in *Indian Metals v. Indonesia* recently summarized the broad consensus in the jurisprudence on this topic in the following terms:\n\n\"There is a consistent jurisprudence which supports the conclusion that investment treaties, including this BIT, that define investments broadly, protect indirect investments as well. This is true regardless of whether there is an explicit reference to direct or indirect investments in the treaty [...].\"162\n\n**Exh. CL-203,** *Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd. v. Republic of Indonesia,* PCA Case No. 2015-40, Award, 29 March 2019, para. 179, referring to *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, August 3, 2004, para. 137; *loannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, July 6, 2007, paras 123-124; *Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others (Case formerly known* as *Mobil Corporation and others) v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07 127, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, para. 165; *Cemex Caracas Investments BV and Cemex Caracas II Investments BV v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, December 30, 2010, paras 151-153; *Guaracachi & Rurelec v. Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2011-17, Award, paras 352-356; *Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Decision on Jurisdiction and Competence, para. III).\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent further invokes differences in language used in other investment treaties concluded by Spain. It suggests that the lack of an express specification in the Treaty means that the BIT only covers direct investments. The Tribunal cannot follow this argumentation. As it is clear from the authorities cited by Spain, comparative treaty practice can only serve as supplementary means of treaty interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.163 Here, the application of the primary means of interpretation shows that indirect investments qualify for treaty protection. It is thus unnecessary to resort to comparative treaty practice.\n\n**Exh. RLA-101,** Aust, *Modern Treaty Law and Practice* (3rd ed., Cambridge University Press 2013), p. 220.\n\n327.\n\nIn any event, the fact that Spain and Mexico did not elaborate on the directness of investments in the Treaty does not mean that they intended to rule out indirect investments. As noted in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* in relation to comparative treaty practice, \"there is no single way of drafting definitions\".164 Some treaties are more detailed than others and there is no indication here that the Treaty\u2019s silence on this point should be interpreted as an exclusion.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 September 2013, para. 284.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Treaty definition of \"investment\" does not require that assets be owned or controlled directly by the national of the home state in order for them to qualify as protected investments. Spain\u2019s objection in relation to the indirect nature of the investment is accordingly denied.\n\n**b.** ***Proof of Ownership and Control***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal now moves to Spain\u2019s objection that the Claimants have not proffered sufficient evidence of their actual ownership or control of the shares and bonds in Banco Popular.\n\n330.\n\nTo recall, Article I(4) requires the \"assets\" constituting investments to be \"owned or controlled by investors\" of the home State. Ownership and control are clearly alternative requirements. Consequently, the Claimants must show that they either (i) owned the shares/bonds in Banco Popular, or (ii) controlled them. In connection with control, the Tribunal considers that the notion referred to in Article I(4) of the Treaty is broad and does not require a specific form for its exercise.\n\n331.\n\nAs noted in *Abengoa v. Mexico* in connection with the same Article l(4) of the Treaty:\n\n\"El art\u00edculo 1.4 del APPRI 2006 no define el concepto de control. El Tribunal Arbitral observa que este requisito es alternativo a la condici\u00f3n de propiedad y se aplica de manera amplia a todos los activos enumerados. Por tanto, el APPRI 2006 claramente ha entendido amparar sujetos que, aunque no resulten propietarios de los activos, ejerzan un control sobre los mismos. El APPRI 2006 tampoco contiene restricci\u00f3n alguna en cuanto a la naturaleza o las modalidades de dicho control.\"\n\n332.\n\nThe relevant question is whether the Claimants have proven that they \"owned or controlled\" their shares and bonds in accordance with Article l(4) of the Treaty. It is not in dispute that the Claimants held their shares in Banco Popular through various intermediaries, i.e. companies (some of which offshore) and trusts. However, this does not mean that they did not control the shares under various types of arrangements with the companies and trusts.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the voluminous documentation provided by the Claimants in support of their allegations. Although the exercise was not always simple and the explanations provided by the Claimants on certain corporate structures or trusts was sometimes relatively brief, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established that all of them, except for four (as explained below), owned or controlled the relevant shares in Banco Popular. The following sections review in some details the Tribunal\u2019s findings in respect of each Claimant\u2019s shareholding. The numbering for each of the Claimants follows the numbering in paragraph 2 above.\n\n334.\n\nFirst, 35 out of 54 Claimants invested in Banco Popular through brokerage accounts. Specifically:\n\n\u2022 Claimant 1 (through brokerage accounts with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 3 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 4 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 6 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 9 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 10 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 12 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 14 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 16 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 17 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 18 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 19 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 20 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 22 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 23 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 24 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 25 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 27 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 28 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 31 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 32 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 34 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]); ;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 35 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 36 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 37 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 39 (through brokerage accounts with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 40165 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 41 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 42 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 43 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 44 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 45 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 47 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 51 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 54 (through brokerage account with [REDACTED]);\n\nAs discussed *infra* at paras. 393-394, the Claimants \"dropped\" Mr. Casanueva y Llaguno from the arbitration in the course of the proceedings.\n\n335.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence on record,166 the Tribunal is satisfied that the brokerage accounts through which Banco Popular\u2019s shares were bought belonged to the Claimants and were operated to their benefit, rather than to the intermediaries\u2019 benefit. The aforementioned Claimants thus controlled the shares in Banco Popular.\n\nSee Appendix D to the Reply.\n\n336.\n\nSecond, the following Claimants invested in Banco Popular through [REDACTED], a limited partnership established in [REDACTED] in [REDACTED]:\n\n\u2022 Claimant 8;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 13;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 21;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 42;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 46;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 47.\n\n337.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:167\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nThis and the following diagrams are excerpted from the Claimants\u2019 submissions.\n\n338.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest [REDACTED]'s title to Banco Popular\u2019s shares.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established through the various documentation submitted into the record168 that the afore-mentioned six Claimants were the shareholders and thus beneficiaries of [REDACTED], which held Banco Popular\u2019s shares through a brokerage account with [REDACTED]. There is nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED]. that would contradict the fact that Claimants 8, 13, 21, 42, 46 and 47 had control over Banco Popular\u2019s shares held by that intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-001,** [REDACTED] Agreement and Appointment of [REDACTED]; **Appendix C-002,** [REDACTED] Certificaci\u00f3n de Estructura de Accionistas; **CRFA-A-36,** Identity Documents of [REDACTED] ; **Appendix C-044,** Correction to [REDACTED] General Partner Certificate, 23 July 2019.\n\n340.\n\nThird, the following individuals invested in Banco Popular through [REDACTED]., a limited partnership created in the [REDACTED] in [REDACTED]:\n\n\u2022 Claimant 2;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 14;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 34.\n\n341.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest [REDACTED]' title to Banco Popular\u2019s shares.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established by reference to the relevant documentation169 that the afore-mentioned three Claimants were the shareholders and beneficiaries of [REDACTED] which held Banco Popular's shares through a brokerage account with [REDACTED]. Furthermore, there is nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED] that would suggest that Claimants 2, 14 and 34 did not control Banco Popular\u2019s shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-003,** LPA of [REDACTED] Reply, Annex A, pp. 1, 5 and 34\n\n344.\n\nFourth, two Claimants held Banco Popular's shares through [REDACTED] incorporated in the [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] :\n\n\u2022 Claimant 14; and\n\n\u2022 Claimant 17.\n\n345.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute [REDACTED]'s title to Banco Popular\u2019s shares.\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established by reference to the relevant documentation submitted into the record170 that Claimants 14 and 17 were the shareholders and beneficiaries of [REDACTED] which held Banco Popular\u2019s shares through a brokerage account. The constituting documents of [REDACTED] do not contain any provision limiting Claimant 14\u2019s and 17\u2019s control over Banco Popular\u2019s shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-004,** [REDACTED] Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, 25 September 2013; **Appendix C-005,** [REDACTED] Certificate of Incumbency.\n\n348.\n\nFifth, several Claimants held Banco Popular\u2019s shares through [REDACTED] a limited partnership registered in [REDACTED]:\n\n\u2022 Claimant 6;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 26;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 50;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 52;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 53;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 54.\n\n349.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n350.\n\nSpain does not challenge [REDACTED]'s title to Banco Popular\u2019s shares.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established by reference to the relevant documentation171 that the afore-mentioned six Claimants were the shareholders and ultimate beneficiaries of [REDACTED]. Nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED] limit Claimants 6, 26, 50, 52, 53 and 54\u2019s control over Banco Popular\u2019s shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-006,** [REDACTED], Limited Partnership Agreement, 18 May 2016; **Appendix C-007,** [REDACTED], Subscription Agreement Fideicomiso 100-1, 18 May 2016; **Appendix C-008,** [REDACTED] Subscription Agreement Fideicomiso 100-2, 14 June 2016; **Appendix C-009,** [REDACTED] Subscription Agreement Fideicomiso 100-3, 17 June 2016; **Appendix C-010,** Certificaci\u00f3n [REDACTED], 15 May 2020; **Appendix C-011,** [REDACTED] Subscription Agreement [REDACTED] , 4 August 2016; **Appendix C-012,** [REDACTED]., Subscription Agreement [REDACTED] 4 August 2016; **Appendix C-046,** [REDACTED] Certificate of Capital Structure, 1 December 2017.\n\n352.\n\nSpain takes issue with the fact that Claimant 26 brought its claim as trustee of [REDACTED]. The Tribunal considers that, having a legal title to [REDACTED]\u2019s shares, Claimant 26 falls within the scope of the Treaty protection.\n\n353.\n\nSixth, the following Claimants invested in Banco Popular through [REDACTED], a [REDACTED] limited partnership formed in [REDACTED]:\n\n\u2022 Claimant 5;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 26;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 29;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 30;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 33;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 38;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 48;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 49.\n\n354.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n355.\n\nSpain does not dispute [REDACTED]'s title to Banco Popular\u2019s shares.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established that Claimants 26, 30, 38 and 48 owned [REDACTED].172 Nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED] deprived Claimants 26, 30, 38 and 48 of their control over and benefit from Banco Popular\u2019s shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **CRFA-A-30,** Identity documents of [REDACTED] **Appendix C-017,** [REDACTED]., Limited Partnership Agreement, 22 September 2008.\n\n357.\n\nBy contrast, it appears from the documentation submitted into the record that Claimants [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]were neither beneficial nor legal owners of [REDACTED].\n\n358.\n\nRather, they are beneficiaries of [REDACTED], which, according to the constituting documents,173 would acquire rights in connection with [REDACTED] only in case of death, absence or legal incapacity of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. The Tribunal notes that Spain raised specific objections in relation to these Claimants in its Annex A to the Rejoinder. The Claimants have not specifically addressed these objections. Actually, a comparison between the Annex 1 to the SoC and the Annex I to the Claimants\u2019 first post-hearing brief, which replaced the former, shows that Annex 1 to the SoC lists Claimants [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as beneficiaries in connection with [REDACTED]:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nReply, **Appendix C-032,** Segundo Convenio Modificatorio al Contrato de [REDACTED], 18 January 2017; **Appendix C-022,** Quinto Convenio Modificatorio al Contrato [REDACTED], de [REDACTED], 18 January 2017; **Appendix C-018,** Certificaci\u00f3n 15 May 2020.\n\n359.\n\nBy contrast, in the subsequent Annex I to the first PHB, these four individuals are no longer listed as beneficiaries and have been replaced by Claimants [REDACTED]:\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal thus understands that the Claimants have conceded that these four Claimants have no vested rights to the relevant shares that would entitle them to bring claims in this arbitration. Taking into account all these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not sufficiently shown that Claimants 5, 29, 33, and 49 owned or controlled shares in Banco Popular.\n\n361.\n\nSeventh, the following Claimants held shares through [REDACTED]., a [REDACTED] limited partnership created in [REDACTED]:\n\n\u2022 Claimant 6;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 54;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 52;\n\n\u2022 Claimant 50.\n\n362.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established by reference to the relevant documents174 that Claimants 6, 50, 52 and 54 were the owners or ultimate beneficiaries of [REDACTED] and Banco Popular's shares that the intermediary held. The constituting documents of [REDACTED] do not limit Claimants 6, 50, 52 and 54\u2019s control over Banco Popular\u2019s shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-034,** [REDACTED]., Ownership Certification, 1 December 2017; **Appendix C-033,** Second Amended and Restated [REDACTED] Agreement, 12 June 2012; **CRFA-A-52,** Identity documents of [REDACTED].\n\n364.\n\nEighth, Claimant 19 invested in Banco Popular through [REDACTED]., incorporated in the [REDACTED] in [REDACTED]. The corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established that Claimant 19 was the ultimate beneficiary of [REDACTED] and of the Banco Popular shares that the intermediary held.175 Nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED] deprived Claimant 19 of his control over the Banco Popular shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-038,** [REDACTED] Shareholder Certification, 12 February 2016; **Appendix** C-035, [REDACTED] , at Section 1 (b), Third Schedule (A) (noting that [REDACTED]); **Appendix c-036,** [REDACTED], 26 June 2007.\n\n366.\n\nNinth, Claimant 15 invested in Banco Popular through [REDACTED] a company incorporated in [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] . is partially owned by [REDACTED], which acts in the best interest and on behalf of the of the [REDACTED], of which [REDACTED].\n\n367.\n\nThe corporate structure of [REDACTED] is as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants have established that Claimant 15 was the ultimate beneficiary of [REDACTED] and of Banco Popular shares held by the intermediary.176 Nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED] deprived Claimant 15 of his control over and benefit from the Banco Popular shares held by the intermediary.\n\nReply, **Appendix C-040,** [REDACTED]**,** Memorandum and Articles of Association; **Appendix C-041,** Nominee Agreement between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]; **Appendix C-039,** Amendment and Restatement of the [REDACTED], at 6; **Appendix C-043,** Deed of Distribution, Indemnity, and Termination relating to the [REDACTED], at 2-3.\n\n369.\n\nFinally, Claimant 7 invested in the bank through [REDACTED]. Claimant 11 is a legal owner of the bank\u2019s shares, which it holds as [REDACTED] Nothing in the constituting documents of [REDACTED] deprived [REDACTED] of his control over and benefit from the bank\u2019s shares held by [REDACTED]. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have proven that [REDACTED] were the legal and beneficial owners of the shares in Banco Popular.177 In respect of Spain\u2019s objection that the Claimants have double-counted the shares of [REDACTED] as they are allegedly listed twice (once for [REDACTED] personally, and once for [REDACTED]),178 the Tribunal has taken note of the Claimants\u2019 representation that they are not claiming damages for the same shareholding twice.179 Issues of this sort will be reviewed at the quantum stage, if the Tribunal reaches that stage. For present purposes, the Tribunal is satisfied that it has jurisdiction in respect of the investments of both Claimants.\n\n***\\* \\* \\****\n\n**Annex 0001** submitted with Claimants\u2019 Statement of Claim, at 1; Reply, **CRFA-A-11,** Identity documents of [REDACTED] and **Appendix B-5,** [REDACTED] - Bank Statements.\n\nRejoinder, Annex A, pp. 12, 17-18.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 366-367.\n\n370.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants have established that all of them, except for Claimants 5, 29, 33 and 49, owned and/or controlled shares in Banco Popular. Therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes between Claimants 5, 29, 33 and 49 and Spain for lack of ownership or control over a qualifying investment.\n\n**c.** ***\"Inherent\" characteristics of an investment***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nSpain argues that the Claimants have not demonstrated that their alleged investments have the \"inherent characteristics of an investment, including contribution, duration and risk.180\n\nSoD, paras. 626-634; Rejoinder, paras. 673-675.\n\n372.\n\nIn line with other arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal considers that the terms \"investment\" in Article l(4) of the Treaty has an objective meaning which requires the presence of the elements of contribution, or commitment of resources, duration and risk.181\n\nSee, e.g., **Exh. RL-0074,** *Romak v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* UNCITRAL Case PCA N AA280. Award, 26 November 2009, para. 207 (\"The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term 'investments\u2019 under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk\"); **Exh. RL-0396,** *A.M.F. Aircraftleasing v. Czech Republic,* PCA, Final Award, 11 May 2020, para. 472.\n\n373.\n\nWith regard to contribution, the Tribunal is of the view that each Claimant must show that it has made a commitment of resources. Contrary to Spain\u2019s position, this does, however, not mean that there is any purported requirement for \"active\" contribution or management of the investment.182 To the contrary, it is sufficient for the Claimants to show that they have purchased their shares and/or bonds for a price. In this respect, the Respondent takes issue with the fact that the Claimants did not provide sufficient information as to how and at what price they purchased their shares or bonds. The Tribunal disagrees. The abundant documentation, including bank records, filed by the Claimants include specific information regarding their purchases of Banco Popular shares and bonds. Hence, by purchasing shares and/or bonds the Claimants made a commitment of resources.\n\nSee also **Exh. CL-226,** *Garanti Koza LLP v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Award, 19 December 2016, paras. 230-231; **Exh. CL-227,** *South American Silver Ltd. (Bermuda) v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2013-15, Award, 22 November 2018, paras. 233, 331; **Exh. CL-228,** *Vladislav Kim & Others v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2017, paras. 306, 310-12; **Exh. CL-229,** *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22 September 2014, paras. 225-26, 230, 256, 260, 261, 272.\n\n374.\n\nIn respect of duration, Spain takes issue with the fact that certain Claimants purchased large amounts of shares and bonds in Banco Popular in late 2016 a few months prior to Banco Popular's 2017 resolution. It is true that the duration of those investments ended up being short. However, there is no indication that the Claimants did not intend to hold their shares for a long time had the resolution not occurred. In addition, the Claimants held the majority of their shares and bonds for a number of years. Accordingly, this requirement appears met as well.\n\n375.\n\nFinally, in connection with risk, by buying shares in Banco Popular, the Claimants assumed investment risk, i.e. the risk that the value of the shares could increase, decrease, or even be lost entirely. They also bore investment risk in relation to the bonds, although to a lesser extent than with respect to shares.\n\n376.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants\u2019 investments satisfy the conditions of contribution, duration and risk to be protected under the Treaty.\n\n**d.** ***Reflective Loss***\n----------------------------\n\n377.\n\nSpain raised its reflective loss objection for the first time in its Rejoinder. In accordance with Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence [...]\". On this basis, the Tribunal considers that this objection is belated and must thus be denied. Spain\u2019s explanation that it put forward such objection in response to the Claimants\u2019 Reply is unconvincing, as in that submission the Claimants only mentioned \"reflective losses\" once and *en passant.183* There is thus no reason to consider the delay justified in accordance with Article 23(2), last sentence, of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letter, 27 December 2021, para. 7.\n\n**D.** **Jurisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nSpain contends that \"some of the acts that Claimants allege to be breaches of the Treaty occurred before a large portion of Claimants\u2019 investments were made\".184\n\nSoD, para. 635.\n\n379.\n\nAccording to Spain, since the Claimants brought this arbitration as a group, they can only challenge acts that occurred after the last of their investments was made.185 Any distinction among claims would breach the Joinder Agreement.186\n\nRequest for Trifurcation, paras. 127-154; SoD, paras. 635-666; Rejoinder, paras. 752-795; R-PHB1, paras. 26-31; R-PHB2, paras. 14-15.\n\nSoD, para. 664, referring to Joinder Agreement.\n\n380.\n\nThe last investment was made on 12 May 2017 by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Casanueva y Llaguno. Hence, any acts that occurred prior to 12 May 2017 fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Spain submits this objection primarily related to the complaints about the public deposit withdrawals in 2015 and 2016.\n\n**2. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe Claimants argue that all of them, except for Mr. Jos\u00e9 Casanueva y Llaguno, had made their investments by December 2016.187 Consequently, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims arising from events that occurred in 2017. The Claimants have summarized the \"temporal terms\" of each of the impugned actions and omissions in the following table:188\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Actions and omissions imputed by the claimants | Temporary terms |\n| Withdrawal of deposits126 | From October 2016 until May 2017 |\n| Non-suspention of operations at short127 | Undetermined date |\n| Public statements | 10th of April- 18th of May 2017 |\n| Contracting of valuators by SRB128 | 23th of May 2017 |\n| Extended sesion of SRB on BPE followup | 24th of May 2017 |\n| Procuring an Investment Bank through FROB ' | 30th of May 2017 |\n| BPE sends guidelines for the selling process | 3rd of June 2017 |\n| Signing of confidentiality agreements | 4 th of June 2017 |\n| Provision of ELA129 | 5-6th of June 2017 |\n| FOLTF Statement | 6th of June 2017 |\n| Resolution statement and sale to Banco Santander | 6-8th of June 2017 |\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 356-365; C-PHB2, paras. 209-213. The Claimants accept that the Tribunal can render one award, in which it grants relief to all but Mr. Jos\u00e9 Casanueva y Llaguno.\n\nResponse to the Request for Trifurcation, paras. 64-71; Reply, paras. 405-407; C-PHB1, paras. 356-365; C-PHB2, paras. 209-213.\n\n382.\n\nThe Claimants consider that all these events fall within the Tribunal\u2019s *ratione temporis* jurisdiction. They specify that they do not impugn the withdrawals that occurred in 2015 on their own, but together with the withdrawals effected in 2016-2017.189\n\nReply, paras. 408, 418. See also C-PHB1, paras. 357-358; C-PHB2, para. 211.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n383.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 positions in respect of this objection have evolved throughout the case. Initially, Spain argued that the Claimants had not provided sufficient details on the timing of their share and bond acquisitions in Banco Popular and, accordingly, had not proven ownership of their alleged investments at the relevant times.190 In response to Spain\u2019s argument, the Claimants summarized the information regarding the timing of their investments first in Annex A to their Reply and subsequently in Annex I to their first PHB,191 while at the same time acknowledging certain jurisdictional shortcomings in respect of one individual Claimant, as further described below. As a result of this evolution of the Parties\u2019 position and the additional documents supplied by the Claimants, Spain has finally articulated its defense on the following two main arguments. First, Spain contends that some of the acts of which the Claimants complain took place before the Claimants made their investments. Second, it maintains that because the Claimants elected to bring their claims collectively and litigate them as a group, their claims are limited to establishing Spain\u2019s liability on the basis of acts or omissions that occurred after the *latest-in-time investment* was made by *any* of the Claimants\".192\n\nSoD, paras. 637-639.\n\nAnnex I to the C-PHB1 is said to be a \"[r]eplacement of Annex 1 in SoC\", which was entitled \"Claimants' holdings as of June 6, 2017\".\n\nRejoinder, para. 758 (emphasis added).\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the second argument according to which the relevant date to establish the Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction is the last date on which *any* of the individual Claimants purchased shares or bonds in Banco Popular. In essence, Spain argues that the Joinder Agreement requires the Claimants to present a \"homogenous claim\". Consequently, because Mr. Casanueva invested as late as May 2017, jurisdiction *ratione tempons* should be assessed for all Claimants as of that date. In support, Spain contends that \"the expectations that any of the Claimants could have had in 2013 are different from the expectations that Claimants had when acquiring shares in 2016 or 2017 and therefore cannot form the basis of a single and homogenous claim for all Claimants\".193\n\nR-PHB1, para. 28.\n\n385.\n\nIn this arbitration, each individual Claimant raises claims in his or her own name. Even though all the individual Claimants chose to act together in one single proceeding, the Tribunal must ensure that it has jurisdiction over each individual claim. Indeed, as noted by the tribunal in *PV Investors v. Spain,* in an aggregate proceeding with multiple claimants, \"the Tribunal must satisfy itself that the jurisdictional requirements are satisfied in relation to each claimant\".194 If the inquiry were to show that a given Claimant or investment falls outside of the scope of the Treaty, such conclusion would not automatically affect all the other Claimants. The Respondent has not advanced any convincing reason why a jurisdictional flaw that only affects certain of the Claimants would automatically extend to the entire group and nothing in the Joinder Agreement suggests such an outcome. Spain\u2019s further argument regarding legitimate expectations is equally to no avail in this context, as it conflates matters of jurisdiction and liability. Indeed, a tribunal could well have jurisdiction over a number of claimants who made their investments at different times on the basis of different expectations and whether they were frustrated would then be a matter for the merits, not jurisdiction.195\n\n*PV Investors v. Spain,* PCA Case. 2012-14, Preliminary Award, 13 October 2014, para. 99.\n\nSee also *PV Investors v. Spain,* PCA Case. 2012-14, Preliminary Award, 13 October 2014, para. 99 (\"What matters is that disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor be adjudged in their individual dimension, i.e., in the same way as they would be in [a treaty] arbitration with a single claimant. This means in particular that, at the present jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must satisfy itself that the jurisdictional requirements are satisfied in relation to each claimant. *Insofar as there may be differences between the Claimants, in terms for instance of alleged legitimate expectations or losses, these differences will be examined at the merits stage of the procedure,* emphasis added).\n\n386.\n\nConsequently, regardless of the fact that the Claimants have started this arbitration as a group, the Tribunal must examine whether the *ratione temporis* jurisdictional requirements are satisfied in relation to each Claimant.\n\n387.\n\nAs already noted, the Treaty limits the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to \"[a]ny dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party *due to alleged non-compliance with an obligation under this Agreement'* (\"Toda controversia [...] *derivada de un presunto incumplimiento de una obligaci\u00f3n establecida en este Acuerdo).*196 Because the Treaty provides for dispute resolution only with respect to the substantive standards set forth in the Treaty, the non-retroactivity principle (Article 28 VCLT) limits the disputes over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction.197 More specifically, and as far as relevant here,198 a Contracting Party\u2019s obligations to any given investor of the other Contracting Party only arise after the date of the investment by the qualifying investor, at which point in time the Treaty obligations become applicable to such qualifying investor. For that reason, tribunals have consistently held that an investor bringing a claim based on a treaty obligation must have owned or controlled the investment when that obligation was allegedly breached.\n\nSee **Exh. C-1,** Treaty, Article IX, dealing with the obligation to notify the dispute, and Article XI, entitled \"Referral to Arbitration\", which cross-references the same notification (\"[p]rovided that six months have elapsed since the *notification referred to in article IX,* the disputing investor may submit the claim to arbitration in accordance with [...]\"). (emphasis added).\n\nSee **Exh. RL-0002,** *Philip Morris v. Australia,* PCA Case No. 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, para. 528 (finding that the theoretical distinction between jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and the temporal application of the substantive standards \"is unnecessary when the cause of action is founded upon a treaty breach).\n\nIn addition to the requirements discussed in the text, the Treaty must be into force when the alleged breach occurs. In this case, it is not disputed that the Treaty entered into force before any of the challenged acts occurred and any of the Claimants made their investments.\n\n388.\n\nAs explained by the tribunal in *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel v. Peru:*\n\n\"146. [...] *where the claim is founded upon an alleged breach of the Treaty\u2019s substantive standards,* a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to a dispute between the host state and a national or company which has acquired its protected investment *before the alleged breach occurred.* In other words, the Treaty must be in force and the national or company must have already made its investment when the alleged breach occurs, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a breach of that Treaty's substantive standards affecting that investment.\n\n147. *This conclusion follows from the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties,* which entails that the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the state conduct that occurred *after these protections became applicable to the eligible investment.* Because the BIT is at the same time the instrument that creates the substantive obligation forming the basis of the claim before the Tribunal and the instrument that confers jurisdiction upon the Tribunal, a claimant bringing a claim based on a Treaty obligation must have owned or controlled the investment when that obligation was allegedly breached.\"199\n\n**Exh. CL-0119,** *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi and Gremcitel S.A v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17, Award, 9 January 2015, paras. 146-147.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus determine the dates of (1) the alleged breach(es) and (2) the relevant investment(s).200 If (1) has occurred before (2), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over disputes derived from such alleged breaches.\n\nAs mentioned *supra* in footnote 198, it is not disputed that the Treaty entered into force before the challenged acts occurred and the Claimants made their investments.\n\n390.\n\nIn this case, because (1) the Claimants complain of a variety of measures and (2) they have made their investments at different times, the analysis must necessarily address both of these aspects and their combination.\n\n391.\n\nWith regard to the contested measures, the Tribunal notes that, with the exception of the so-called early deposit withdrawals of 2015-2016 (to which the Tribunal will revert), all of the impugned measures date from 2017 onwards.201 Initially Spain objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the claims concerning Spain\u2019s alleged failure to suspend short sales (for which the Claimants\u2019 table reproduced above at para. 381 indicated an \"undetermined date\"). However, in their Response to the Trifurcation Request, the Claimants clarified that although in the SoC they \"did not assign a specific date to Respondent\u2019s failure to suspend short sales, they explained that Banco Popular\u2019s financial position became critical in January 2017. [...] *That is when a short-sale ban would have been appropriate, so the short-sale omission falls into the 2017 timeframe* [...]\".202 The Tribunal thus understands that the Claimants are raising claims in respect of Spain\u2019s alleged failure to suspend short sales only from 2017 onwards. As a result, all of the measures of which the Claimants complain, with the exception of the early deposit withdrawals, were taken after January 2017.\n\nSee chart reproduced above at para. 381.\n\nResponse to Trifurcation Request, para. 68 (emphasis added).\n\n392.\n\nWith regard to the dates of the relevant investments, the Tribunal has reviewed the evidence filed by the Claimants on their acquisition of shares and bonds in Banco Popular and is satisfied that, subject to the qualifications in the following paragraphs, all of them had acquired their investments by the end of 2016, i.e., before the 2017 date of the earliest impugned measure.\n\n393.\n\nThe first qualification concerns Mr. Jos\u00e9 Casanueva y Llaguno (i.e., Claimant 40), who purchased his shares in Banco Popular on 12 May 2017.203 In their first PHB, the Claimants conceded that \"the only Claimant that did not invest prior to December 2016 is Mr. Jos\u00e9 Casanueva y Llaguno\" and maintained that \"[t]he most obvious means to address this issue is to omit [Mr. Casanueva y Llaguno] from the final Award\", which \"the Consolidation Agreement does not prevent the Tribunal from doing [...]\".204 In their second PHB, they referred back to that submission and confirmed that they had \"agreed to drop that investor and his investments from the arbitration\".205\n\nSee Reply, **Appendix B-34,** Jos\u00e9 Maria Casanueva y Llaguno - Bank Statement Extracts, p. 3.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 361.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 210 (\"With respect to the single individual who did not purchase shares or bonds until 2017, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Casanueva y Llaguno, Claimants agreed to drop that investor and his investments from the arbitration\"), citing to C-PHB1, para. 361.\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note that the Claimants have \"dropped\" Mr. Casanueva y Llaguno from the arbitration and thus confirms that he may not claim in these proceedings.\n\n395.\n\nThe second qualification concerns disputes arising out of the so-called early public deposit withdrawals that occurred in 2015-2016, i.e. before the end of 2016 (at which point all of the Claimants, save for Mr. Casanueva, had made their investments). The question here is whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over disputes arising out of these withdrawals.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that the Claimants do not allege that the 2015-2016 deposits constitute breaches of the Treaty in and of themselves. Rather, they contend that \"[e]ven though Respondent\u2019s deposit withdrawals took place prior to that date [December 2016], those acts are properly before this Tribunal *because of their continuing nature* and their connection to Respondent\u2019s later challenged acts that also led to the destruction of Claimants\u2019 investment\".206\n\nC-PHB1, para. 359.\n\n397.\n\nAs a result of this argumentation, it is important to clarify certain distinctions linked to the duration of a wrongful act. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility distinguish between (i) instantaneous (or simple, or one-time, or non-continuing) (Article 14(1)), (ii) continuing (Articles 14(2) and (3)), and (iii) composite wrongful acts (Article 15).\n\n398.\n\nAn instantaneous wrongful act entails that the act and its consequence are fixed at a particular point in time.207 This is the case for instance of a nationalization decree which is performed on the date of that decree.208 The notion of instantaneous act is reflected in Article 14(1) ILC Articles as follows:\n\n\"1. The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character occurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.\"\n\nIn James Crawford\u2019s words, \"the wrongful act itself can be narrowed down to a single date - virtually a single moment in time - and anything that continues afterwards represents the effects of the breach, rather than a continuation of the act itself\u2019. James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP, 2013), p. 255.\n\n**Exh. CL-193,** *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, para. 2.67; **Exh. CL-50,** ILC Articles, Commentary *ad* Art. 14, para. 4; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP, 2013), p. 254; **Exh. RL-0416,** *Infinito Gold v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5, Award, 3 June 2021, paras. 231-233.\n\n399.\n\nA wrongful act with a continuing character, by contrast, is an act of the same nature as an instantaneous act, but extends over a period of time, a classic example being a State\u2019s wrongful detention of an individual, which continues throughout the period of detention. As formulated in ILC Articles 14(2) and (3):\n\n\"2. The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State *having a continuing character* extends over the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation.\n\n3. The breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs and extends over the entire period during which the event continues and remains not in conformity with that obligation.\"\n\n400.\n\nFinally, a composite act is composed of a series of different acts that extend over that period. In other words, a composite act results from an aggregation of other acts and has acquired a different legal characterization than those other acts. The relevant provision is Article 15 of the ILC Articles which reads as follows:\n\n\"1. The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.\n\n2. In such a case, the breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for as long as these actions or omissions are repeated and remain not in conformity with the international obligation.\"\n\n401.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 submissions dealing with the characterization of the deposit withdrawals are unclear. In their Reply, the Claimants contended that they \"are not alleging that any one of the 2015 withdrawals constitutes a violation of the Treaty on its own\", adding that \"Claimants\u2019 position is that it is the *totality* of the withdrawals and their *cumulative* effect on their investments that amount to a breach of the Treaty\".209 The mention of the \"totality\" of the withdrawals and their \"cumulative effect\" could have been understood as a reference to a composite act, i.e. a \"series of actions or omissions *defined in aggregate as wrongful\u2019* according to Article 15(1) of the ILC Articles quoted above. However, a few paragraphs later, the Claimants noted that \"[t]he relevant article of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts is actually Article 14, and in particular, Commentary 12 thereto\",210 and specified that the \"Respondent\u2019s behavior constitutes a *continuing* breach of the Treaty and should be treated as such\".211 Notwithstanding this specification, at the May Hearing they referred to Article 15 of the ILC Articles.212 Further, in their first PHB, while insisting on their characterization of a \"continuing breach\",213 they cited both Articles 14 and 15.214 Finally, in their second PHB, the Claimants argued more generally that \"the deposit withdrawals are covered by the ILC Articles, which provides that a continuing act receives protection as long as the later acts benefit from treaty protection\".215\n\nReply, para. 408 (emphasis added). They also stated that \"[w]hile the later deposit withdrawals would not have had the same effect without the earlier withdrawals, it is not the case that the early withdrawals, in and of themselves, constitute the \"breach\" in this case. Rather, it was Respondent\u2019s decision to force [Banco Popular]\u2019s sale via resolution, when the bank was already gasping for air in the midst of its run on deposits, that constituted the breach. This breach occurred in 2017\". Ibid., para. 409.\n\nReply, para. 413.\n\nReply, para. 413 (emphasis added).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slide 90, referring to ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 15 and Art. 15, Commentary 11.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 358.\n\nC-PHB1, fn. 712.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 211.\n\n402.\n\nBe this as it may, the early deposit withdrawals of which the Claimants complain cannot be characterized as continuing wrongful acts. As explained by the ILC, \"[a]n act does not have a continuing character merely because its effects or consequences extend in time. It must be the wrongful act as such which continues\".216 The examples of continuing wrongful acts given by the ILC include \"the maintenance in effect of legislative provisions incompatible with treaty obligations of the enacting State, unlawful detention of a foreign official or unlawful occupation of embassy premises, maintenance by force of colonial domination, unlawful occupation of part of the territory of another State or stationing armed forces in another State without its consent\".217 By comparison to those illustrations, the deposit withdrawals appear like instantaneous or one-time simple acts. The Claimants have made no serious effort to show how they could be \"continuing\" in nature. Being instantaneous acts, they fall outside of the Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction, because they were committed before the relevant cut-off dates of the Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n**Exh. CL-50,** ILC Articles, Commentary, ad Art. 14, para. 6.\n\n**Exh. CL-50,** ILC Articles, Commentary, *ad* Art. 14, para. 3.\n\n403.\n\nAt most, the contested acts could constitute composite acts within the meaning of Article 15 of the ILC Articles. As noted above at para. 402, even if the Claimants made some references to Article 15 of the ILC Articles in their pleadings, their submissions taken as a whole suggest that the early deposit withdrawals should be characterized as continuing acts within Article 14 of the ILC Articles (a view which the Tribunal has dismissed in the preceding paragraph). Even if the Tribunal had misunderstood the Claimants\u2019 submissions and they *did* characterize the early deposit withdrawals as composite acts, they have not sufficiently substantiated their argument on the effect of a composite breach on the Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis could stop here. However, for the sake of completeness the Tribunal will examine whether it has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over such composite acts.\n\n404.\n\nThe starting point in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis is the temporal rule enshrined in Article 13 of the ILC Articles, whereby \"[a]n act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs\".\n\n405.\n\nWith regard to the potential intertemporal issues raised by composite acts, the ILC Commentary to Article 15 clarifies that:\n\n\"In accordance with [the intertemporal principle set out in article 13], the State must be bound by the international obligation for the period during which the series of acts making up the breach is committed. *In cases where the relevant obligation did not exist at the beginning of the course of conduct but came into being thereafter,* the \"first\" of the actions or omissions of the series for the purposes of State responsibility will be *the first occurring after the obligation came into existence.218*\n\n**Exh. CL-50,** ILC Articles, Commentary, *ad* Art. 15, para. 11 (emphasis added).\n\n406.\n\nThis is only logical because, as explained by Pauwelyn, if a court or tribunal \"took into account acts *prior* to the date of entry into force of the obligation and found that a practice [i.e. a composite act] has been established, it would automatically act contrary to the principle of non-retroactivity since the breach would then start on a date at which the obligation was not yet in force\".219\n\nJ. Pauwelyn, *The Concept of a \"Continuing Violation of an International Obligation: Selected Problems* (1995) 66 BYBIL 415, 447, cited in Z. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims,* Cambridge University Press (2009), p. 335, fn. 52.\n\n407.\n\nThus, acts that have occurred before the Treaty obligations came into existence or became applicable cannot serve as a potential basis of liability.220 However, \"[t]his need not prevent a court taking into account earlier actions or omissions for other purposes (e.g. in order to establish a factual basis for the later breaches or to provide evidence of intent).221\n\nSee also Z. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims,* Cambridge University Press (2009), p. 335, noting that \"if the first acts of the series are alleged to have occurred before the treaty enters into force, \"the intertemporal principle once again trumps all other considerations. The host state cannot be liable to pay damages for the prejudice caused to an investment by the first acts of the series [of an alleged composite act] if at the time of those first acts the obligation in question was not in force in the host state\".\n\n**Exh. CL-50,** ILC Articles, Commentary, *ad* Art. 15, para. 11. As also noted by the tribunal in *MCI v. Ecuador* in the context of its discussion on jurisdiction over composite acts, \"[p]rior events may only be considered by the Tribunal for purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or scope of violations of the BIT that occurred after its entry into force\". *MCI v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007, para. 93.\n\n408.\n\nIn the present dispute, no obligation of Spain was applicable to any of the Claimants before the relevant cut-off dates of their investments. Hence, the first of the actions or omissions of the series for purposes of liability are those occurring *after* the date of each of the Claimants\u2019 investments. Accordingly, only those acts, and not the earlier ones, could give rise to an \"alleged non-compliance with an obligation under this Agreement\" over which the Tribunal would have jurisdiction in accordance with the Treaty\u2019s dispute resolution clause. In other words, to the extent that the Claimants are alleging that the early deposit withdrawals are part of a composite act which started before they made their investments and which was \"accomplished\" after the critical date, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over those deposit withdrawals.\n\n409.\n\nIn conclusion, and subject to the limitations regarding the private/regulatory acts discussed in section VI.B.3 above, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the public deposit withdrawals that occurred in 2015 and 2016 to the extent that such withdrawals predated the Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n**E.** **Jurisdiction over the Dual Spanish-Mexican Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nSpain argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over eight of the Claimants who are dual Spanish-Mexican nationals.222 The Respondent has advanced a number of arguments why Article Xll(2) of the Treaty bars claims by dual nationals.\n\nRequest for Trifurcation, paras. 111-126; SoD, paras. 667-700; Rejoinder paras. 796-832; R-PHB1, paras. 32-33; R-PHB2, para. 17. The eight dual Mexican-Spanish Claimants are: Antonio del Valle Ruiz, Antonio Cos\u00edo Ario, Carlos Ruiz Sacrist\u00e1n, Jaime Ruiz Sacrist\u00e1n, Jorge Esteve Recolons, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fierro Von Mohr, Luis de Garay Russ, and Rogelio Barrenechea Cuenca. See SoD, fn. 1006.\n\n411.\n\nFirst, it contends that Article Xll(2) imposes on qualifying investors \"the requirements of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention\", specifically Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention which prohibits dual nationals from bringing an ICSID claim against their State of nationality.223\n\nSoD, paras. 670-672; Rejoinder, para. 803. See also Trifurcation Request, paras. 116-118.\n\n412.\n\nSecond, relying on the practice of investment tribunals, the Respondent argues that the prohibition on claims by dual nationals also applies to UNCITRAL proceedings.224 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the notion of \"investor\" under the BIT cannot have two different meanings depending on the forum in which a claim is submitted.225 Thus, regardless of the arbitration rules which a claimant chooses, the Treaty must be interpreted as \"if these proceedings took place under the ICSID Convention\".226\n\nSoD, paras. 674 ff. referring to **Exh. RL-0092,** *Enrique and Jorge Heemsen v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2017-18, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 29 October 2019, para. 419; **Exh. RL-0091,** *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas and others v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Award on Jurisdiction, 13 December 2019, para. 715.\n\nSoD, para. 673.\n\nSoD, paras. 676.\n\n413.\n\nThird, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, the Treaty protects only investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the *other* Contracting Party, which thus excludes investments by dual nationals from its scope of protection.227 Spain notes that numerous BIT provisions refer to investors \"of the other Contracting party\", in particular Articles I(4), I(5), II(1), III, IV and IX.228 Furthermore, in the Respondent\u2019s view, a teleological interpretation also leads to excluding dual nationals from the protection of the Treaty. For Spain, the object and purpose of the Treaty, as reflected in its preamble, is to intensify Mexico\u2019s and Spain\u2019s economic cooperation for their reciprocal benefit and create favourable conditions for investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other.229 Thus, the Treaty makes it clear that it does not protect \"investments made in the territory of a Contracting Party by those who hold the nationality of said Contracting Party\".230\n\nSoD, paras. 678-679.\n\nSoD, paras. 680-683.\n\nSoD, para. 677.\n\nSoD, para. 680.\n\n414.\n\nFourth, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 assertions about Spain\u2019s treaty practice, the latter has expressly excluded dual nationals from the protection of its BITs only when the other contracting party so requested. The Respondent underscores that, out of its 88 investment treaties, only two BITs, the Spain-Uruguay BIT and Spain-Colombia BIT, expressly exclude dual nationals from the scope of the treaty. In the Respondent\u2019s contention, this shows that Spain \"did not deem such a clause as necessary\".231\n\nSoD, paras. 692. See **Exh. CL-115,** Spain-Uruguay Agreement on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments, Art. I(3)(c); **Exh. CL-242,** Spain-Colombia BIT, Art. 11(5).\n\n415.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent maintains that customary international law and the principle of non-responsibility codified in the 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws, as applied by investment tribunals,232 bar dual nationals from bringing claims against their States of nationality.233 For the Respondent, investment arbitration would be \"completely distorted\" if investors were allowed to sue their State of nationality.234\n\nSoD, paras. 695-700, referring to **Exh. RL-0091,** *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas and others v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Award on Jurisdiction, 13 December 2019, para. 662.\n\nSoD, para. 696; Rejoinder, para. 825 ff.\n\nSoD, paras. 695.\n\n416.\n\nFinally, while Spain does not appear to take an express position on the \"dominant and effective\" nationality criterion, it contends that *if* [the Tribunal] deems it appropriate to take into account the effective and dominant nationality\",235 it should conclude that the Claimants have not offered any evidence to support their arguments that the dual national Claimants are predominantly Mexican. By contrast, Spain has shown that these individuals make \"effective and habitual use\" of their Spanish nationality by, for instance, frequently travelling with their Spanish passport.236\n\nRejoinder, para. 828 (emphasis added).\n\nRejoinder, paras. 830-831.\n\n417.\n\nIn light of these arguments, Spain concludes that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the eight Claimants who hold dual Mexican-Spanish nationality.237\n\nSoD, paras. 667-668. Rejoinder, para. 796 ff.\n\n**2. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims of the Claimants who are dual nationals.238 For the Claimants, Spain\u2019s dual nationality objection has no basis in the Treaty.239\n\nReply, paras. 428-447; C-PHB1, paras. 371-374; C-PHB2, paras. 214-215.\n\nReply, para. 428 ff.\n\n419.\n\nFirst, according to the Claimants, the definition of \"investor\" in Article l(5)(a) of the Treaty includes *any* physical person who is a national of a Contracting Party and has made an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, without any further requirements or limitations.240 Relying on a number of decisions by investment tribunals, the Claimants argue that the absence of a specific exclusion means that the Treaty protects dual nationals.241 The Claimants maintain that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s submission, the goal of the Treaty, in particular the promotion of \"intensive economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of both countries\" as reflected in the preamble, is fulfilled through \"cross-investment regardless of dual nationality\".242 If the Respondent intended to exclude dual nationals from the protection of the Treaty, so say the Claimants, it would have done so expressly as it did in its BITs with Uruguay and Colombia.243\n\nReply, para. 430.\n\nReply, paras. 435-438, referring to **Exh. CL-114,** *Seraf\u00edn Garcia Armas and Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v.

CL-115,** Spain-Uruguay BIT, Agreement on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments Art. I(3)(c); **Exh. CL-242,** Spain-Colombia BIT, Art. 11(5).\n\n420.\n\nSecond, in the Claimants\u2019 interpretation, Article XII of the Treaty does not transpose the requirements of the ICSID Convention to an UNCITRAL arbitration. It simply requires the Parties to provide their unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration in writing.244\n\nReply, paras. 432-433.\n\n421.\n\nThird, it is the Claimants\u2019 position that the Treaty prevails as *lex specialis* over general principles of international law or customary international law.245 Therefore, as the Treaty contains a broad definition of investor, it protects dual nationals.246\n\nReply, para. 444.\n\nReply, paras. 444-445.\n\n422.\n\nIf, contrary to their primary position, customary international law were applicable, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal should apply the \"dominant and effective\" nationality test adopted by the ICJ in *Nottebohm* in the context of diplomatic protection. In application of such criterion, they argue that the dominant and effective\" nationality of the eight Claimants at issue is Mexican.247 They explain that these individuals (i) reside in Mexico; (ii) have their centre of business and professional interests in Mexico; (iii) have Mexican children, parents, and spouses, who also and reside in Mexico; (iv) pay taxes in Mexico; and (v) conduct their public lives in Mexico. The Claimants assert that the Claimants holding dual nationality use their Spanish passports only as a \"convenience item\".248 Therefore, they cannot be considered Spanish nationals for the purposes of these proceedings.249\n\nReply, para. 446, referring to **Exh.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a.** ***Introductory remarks***\n---------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nIn the preceding sections, the Tribunal has already referred to the rules of treaty interpretation set out in the VCLT (see, e.g., *supra* paras. 246 ff.). For the purposes of this objection, it is helpful to look at them in some more detail.\n\n425.\n\nArticle 31 VCLT, entitled \"General rule of interpretation\", reads as follows:\n\n\"1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n[...]\"\n\n426.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT contains \"the general rule\" of treaty interpretation. The singular mode emphasizes that the provision contains one single rule.250 Its first paragraph refers to wording, context and object and purpose, which, together with the guiding principle of good faith, constitute integral parts of that rule and must be applied in a single combined operation. Paragraph 2 sets out certain elements of the context, whereas paragraph 3 lists additional interpretative means to be used along with the context. As noted by one commentator, it transpires from the formulations used in the first three paragraphs of Article 31 \"that the various means mentioned in Article 31 are all of equal value; none are of an inferior character\" and \"all means will be considered in one and the same, single process of application\".251\n\nSee O. Dorr, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary,* Springer (2nd ed., 2018), p. 561.\n\nM. E. Villiger, *Commentary on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,* Nijhoff (2009), p. 435.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal will apply the various elements referred in Article 31(1) in turn.252\n\nAs the ICJ stated in *Libya v. Chad,* [i]interpretation must be based above all upon the text of the treaty **(Exh.- CL-239,** Territorial Dispute *(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. Chad),* Judgment, ICJ Reports 1994, para. 41).\n\n**b.** ***The Treaty terms in their ordinary meaning, context and in light of the object and purpose (Article 31(1))***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe jurisdiction of this Tribunal derives from Articles IX *et seq.* of the Treaty. Specifically, Article IX(1) requires a prospective claimant to notify in writing [a]ny dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party due to alleged non-compliance with an obligation under this Agreement\". Under Article IX(3), if \"the dispute\" thus notified cannot be settled within six months, \"it shall be submitted to the dispute settlement mechanism stipulated in this Section\", including the international arbitration options provided under Article XI. Article XI, in turn, cross-references the notification requirement under Article IX. Hence, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is limited to \"[a]ny dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and an *investor* of the *other* Contracting Party\" (emphasis added).\n\n429.\n\nThe term \"investors\" is defined in Article I(5)(a) as \"[p]hysical persons who are nationals of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its laws [...] which has made an investment in the territory of the *other* Contracting Party\" (emphasis added). Therefore, jurisdiction extends to a dispute between a \"national of one of the Contracting Parties\" and the \"other\" Contracting Party. It is beyond dispute that, according to the ordinary meaning of the word, the term \"other\" employed in both Articles l(5)(a) and IX requires diversity of nationality between a putative claimant and the respondent State.253\n\nSee, e.g., the definition of \"other\" in the Cambridge Dictionary: *\"different* from the thing or person already mentioned\". See https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/other (emphasis added). Similarly, according to the Oxford dictionary, the term \"other\" denotes \"a person or thing that is *different* or distinct from one already mentioned or known about\" (emphasis added). See https://www.lexico.com/definition/other.\n\n430.\n\nThe context of Articles l(5)(a) and IX *et seq.* and the objectives of the BIT support this interpretation. Under the general rule of interpretation laid down in Article 31(1), \"the terms of a treaty have to be interpreted 'in their context\u2019, which means that the interpreter of any phrase in a treaty has to look at the treaty as a whole and, as Art 31 paras 2 and 3 demonstrate, even beyond that\".254 In this exercise, \"[t]he entire text of the treaty is to be taken into account as 'context\u2019, including title, preamble and annexes\".255 Looking at the treaty as a whole, it is clear that the BIT is premised on the grant of substantive and procedural protection to investors of one Contracting Party vis-\u00e0-vis the *other* Contracting Party. First, the term \"investment\", which is referred to in the definition of \"investors\" at Article l(5)(a) *in fine,* requires assets to be \"owned or controlled by investors of one of the Contracting parties and established in the territory of the *other* Contracting Party\".256 Second, nearly all of the BIT\u2019S substantive provisions concern the manner in which one Contracting Party ought to treat investors of the *other* Contracting Party.257 In addition, several of the non-discrimination provisions contained in the Treaty (see, e.g. Articles III(1), lll(2), VI) require a Contracting Party to grant investors of the other Contracting Party the same treatment it grants \"to its own investors\". These provisions only make sense if one moves from the premise that, from the viewpoint of a Contracting Party, protected investors are only those having the nationality of the *other* Contracting Party. The investor-State dispute settlement provision, for its part, is included in a section that is entitled \"Disputes Between One Contracting Party And Investors Of The *Other* Contracting Party\".258 Finally, the preamble of the BIT, which can \"be of both contextual and teleological significance\",259 recalls the Contracting Parties\u2019 wish \"to intensify economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of both countries\" and their intention \"to create favourable conditions for investments made by either Contracting Party in the territory of the *other\"* (emphasis added).\n\nO.

D\u00f6rr, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary,* Springer (2nd ed., 2018), p. 583.\n\n431.\n\nIn sum, the BIT does not establish an investment framework for domestic investors, but rather aims at protecting investors having a different nationality from the one of the host State. As noted by one investor-State tribunal, diversity of nationality is the rule under the overwhelming majority of investment treaties, where nationals of the host state are normally not allowed to bring investment treaty claims against their home state.260 This rule is consistent with the well-established principle of international law that an individual or entity may not bring an international claim against its own State. In this sense, the investment treaty system is still based on traditional notions of nationality and reciprocity and can be contrasted with the evolution undergone in the field of human rights, where individuals are able to bring claims against the State regardless of their nationality. Indeed, under human rights law, even nationals of the respondent State and stateless individuals are able to bring claims against a State.\n\n*PV Investors v. Spain,* PCA Case. 2012-14, Preliminary Award, 13 October 2014, para. 257.\n\n432.\n\nIn consequence, the requirement for diversity of nationality is the starting point of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into jurisdiction *ratione personae.*\n\n433.\n\nThe situation where an investor of a Party possesses the nationality of the home State *and* the nationality of the respondent/host State, to which the Tribunal will refer as the \"dual national\" situation,261 is not expressly addressed in the Treaty. The Tribunal cannot agree with either of the Parties\u2019 primary positions that dual nationals are included or respectively excluded by the Treaty text.\n\nA dual national situation could also arise if the investor has the nationality of the home State and of a third State (but not that of the respondent State). This is not the situation in this dispute. Hence, as stated in the text, the term \"dual national\" will be used solely to refer to the situation in which an investor of a Party possesses, at the same time, the nationality of the home State and the nationality of the respondent/host State.\n\n434.\n\nFor the Claimants, in the absence of any express indication to the contrary, claims by dual nationals must necessarily be deemed permitted. However, the Tribunal sees nothing in the Treaty\u2019s wording supporting this conclusion. The only indication in the Treaty is that an investor may not bring a claim against its own State Party. If anything, the word \"one\" in Article l(5)(a) could imply that individuals holding the nationalities of more than one of the Contracting Parties would not qualify as \"investors\" under the Treaty. However, the Tribunal is unconvinced by such a reading of the clause as the term \"one\" in this context is simply synonymous to the determiner \"a\" (as is also clear in the authentic Spanish language version: *\"nacionalidad de una Parte Contratante).*\n\n435.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal sees no reason to adopt Spain\u2019s position according to which the text of the Treaty leads to an automatic exclusion of dual nationals, without any further inquiry. Nothing in the text supports this inference and, as just mentioned, the use of the word \"one\" in Article l(5)(a) is insufficient to justify such an interpretation.\n\n436.\n\nIn other words, the Treaty *neither* says that investors must possess \"at least one\" nationality to have standing to claim *nor* does it state that they shall possess only one\" nationality, and the Tribunal is not willing to read terms into the Treaty that are not there. Rather, the Treaty text requires that an investor have the nationality of \"one\" Contracting Party (\"/a *nacionalidad de una Parte Contratante)* and is silent on dual nationality.\n\n437.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s other arguments to exclude dual nationals from the Treaty protection are equally unconvincing. In particular, Spain invites the Tribunal to \"import\" the ICSID requirements on nationality within the Treaty even where, as here, the arbitration is not conducted under the ICSID Convention.\n\n438.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the ICSID Convention, which is one of the options listed in Article Xl(1) of the Treaty, expressly bars dual nationals from bringing claims before the Centre. Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention defines \"national of another Contracting Party\" to the ICSID Convention in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute [on the relevant dates], *but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute* [...]\" (emphasis added).\n\n439.\n\nWhile Spain does not dispute that the UNCITRAL Rules, which apply to this arbitration, do not contain a similar exclusion, it argues that the ICSID requirement also applies in the present UNCITRAL context by virtue of Article XII. This provision reads as follows:\n\n**\"Article XII. Consent**\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall give its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Section.\n\n2. The consent referred to in paragraph 1 above and the submission of a claim to arbitration by a disputing investor shall meet the requirements set out in:\n\n(a) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, which require the consent in writing of the parties; and\n\n(b) Article II of the New York Convention, which requires an agreement in writing.\"\n\n440.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Article XII, entitled \"consent\", seeks to make it clear that each Contracting Party has given \"unconditional consent\" to investment arbitration in one of the options provided under Article XI (Article Xll(1)). Specifically, Article XII of the Treaty is the characteristic \"agreement in writing\" clause included in a number of bilateral investment treaties, which is intended to dispel any doubts that an offer-acceptance \"without privity\" (i.e., a State\u2019s offer which an investor may accept by filing a claim) fulfils the \"consent in writing\" / \"agreement in writing\" requirements under the ICSID and New York Conventions respectively. Contrary to Spain\u2019s argument, Article XII cannot serve to import the jurisdictional *ratione personae* requirements of an ICSID arbitration into an UNCITRAL arbitration. To the contrary, each of the arbitration options provided under the Treaty is governed by its own rules.\n\n441.\n\nThis is explicitly confirmed in Article Xl(2) of the Treaty which states that \"[t]he ICSID Convention *or* the rules mentioned shall govern the arbitration, except as modified by this Section\" (emphasis added). The word \"or\" confirms that the ICSID Convention only governs if ICSID arbitration was chosen. In other words, Article Xl(2) rules out the application in a non-ICSID arbitration of the ICSID *ratione personae* requirements, among which the prohibition of claims by dual nationals.\n\n442.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal does not consider that the Treaty\u2019s notion of investor must always be the same whether a claimant opts for arbitration under the ICSID Convention or under any of the other available fora. This Treaty (like many others) gives a claimant, who meets the definition of \"investor\" set out in Article 1(5)(a), a choice between several arbitration mechanisms. These mechanisms vary in many respects. For example, they are not subject to the same legal framework. Unlike the others, the ICSID Convention system is not subject to a national *lex arbitri* nor to the supervision of national courts and has its own award annulment and enforcement regime. In contrast, an investment arbitration conducted under the other mechanisms (ICSID Additional Facility, UNCITRAL Rules and the \"other arbitration rules [...] agreed by the disputing parties\") is akin to a commercial arbitration with regard to its legal regime, i.e., it is subject to the international arbitration law of the seat and to the jurisdiction of the courts at the seat in aid and control of the arbitration (including annulment of awards), and the recognition and enforcement of awards is governed by the New York Convention.\n\n443.\n\nThe four arbitration options enumerated in Article XI are also different in terms of jurisdictional requirements. For instance, the ICSID Convention and ICSID Additional Facility Rules require respectively that either both or one of the investor\u2019s home state or the respondent state be party to the ICSID Convention. In addition, the ICSID Convention requires that there be a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention); it also provides for particular rules on jurisdiction *ratione personae,* including rules requiring that certain critical dates be met for a claimant to qualify as national of an ICSID Contracting State (see Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention). The other arbitration rules offered in Article XI contain no similar requirements.\n\n444.\n\nBy selecting one of the dispute settlement options available under the Treaty, a claimant opts into a particular legal framework. In this case, the Claimants have opted for the legal framework that arises from the combination of the Treaty requirements with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which do not include any rule analogous to Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n445.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal would find it rather extraordinary that the two Contracting Parties would have intended the ICSID Convention requirements to apply to all the arbitration options included in the Treaty, when at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty in 2006, Mexico had neither signed nor ratified the ICSID Convention (which it did twelve years later).262\n\nSee ICSID/3, List Of Contracting States And Other Signatories Of The Convention (as of September 3, 2021), available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/documents/2021\\_Sep.ICSID.ENG.pdf (stating that Mexico signed and ratified the ICSID Convention in 2018).\n\n446.\n\nIn sum, a textual and contextual analysis of the Treaty in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT leads to the conclusion that the Treaty is silent on the question of dual nationals. Consequently, neither Party\u2019s primary positions on this issue can be accepted.\n\n**c.** ***Means of interpretation under Articles 31(2) and 31(3)(a) and (b)***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nMoving to the other means of interpretation referred to in Article 31, the Tribunal notes that it has not been provided with any elements under Article 31(2) of the VCLT, i.e. \"any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty\" or \"any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty\". Neither has it been presented with \"any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\" or \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the VCLT. It thus turns to the means of interpretation provided in Article 31(3)(c).\n\n**d.** ***Article 31(3)(c) and the principle of systemic integration***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nUnder Article 31(3)(c), the VCLT directs the interpreter to \"take into account, together with the context\" \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\". Hence, in its interpretive process, the Tribunal must (\"shall\") take into account \"other relevant rules of international law\". As McLachlan emphasizes, the rule set out in Article 31(3)(c) forms \"a *mandatory* part of the interpretation process\", whereby it is \"not (as contrasted with the provisions of Article 32 on *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires),* only to be referred to where confirmation is required or the meaning is ambiguous, obscure or manifestly absurd or unreasonable\".263 Article 31(3)(c) is said to express the principle of \"systemic integration\" in treaty interpretation;264 it postulates that treaties are a creation of the international legal system and must thus be interpreted against the background of broader international law rules. In this vein, it has been suggested that the principle of systemic integration may be articulated as a presumption with both positive and negative aspects, meaning that (a) positively the parties are to be taken \"to refer to general principles of international law for all questions which [the treaty] does not itself resolve in express terms or in a different way\"; and (b) negatively, in entering into treaty obligations, the parties intend not to act inconsistently with generally recognized principles of international law or with previous treaty obligations towards third states.265\n\n**Exh.

RL-0242,** McLachlan, Campbell, *The Principle of Systemic Integration and Article 31(3)(C) of the Vienna Convention,* The International and Comparative Law Quarterly 54, no. 2 (2005): 279-319, para. 7.95. This view was adopted by the ILC in its fragmentation report. See ILC Fragmentation of International Law Report, AICN 4/L 682 and add 1, 2016, para. 465.\n\n449.\n\nAs clarified by the ICJ,266 the \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" include customary international law rules, which, as stated by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Amoco:*\n\n\"[...] may be useful in order to fill in possible lacunae of the Treaty to ascertain the meaning of undefined terms in its text or, more generally to aid interpretation and implementation of its provisions.\"267\n\n*Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. USA),* Judgment, 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports (2003), para. 41.\n\n**Exh. RL-0243,** *Amoco International Finance Corporation v. Iran* (1987-II) 15 Iran-USCTR 189, para. 112.\n\n450.\n\nOf course, if the wording of the treaty provides a solution which is different from the one otherwise applicable in general international law, that solution must prevail based on Article 31 (1) (subject to *jus cogens).* However, when the treaty is silent on a given issue, the answer may come from other rules of international law, including customary law.\n\n451.\n\nThe principle of systemic integration must equally apply in the investment treaty context. As observed by the *AAPL v. Sri Lanka* tribunal, the first to exercise jurisdiction under a bilateral investment treaty:\n\n\"[A] Bilateral Investment Treaty *is not a self-contained closed legal system* limited to provide for substantive material rules of direct applicability, but it has to be envisaged *within a wider juridical context in which rules from other sources are integrated through implied incorporation methods,* or by direct reference to certain supplementary rules, whether of international law character or of domestic law nature.\"268\n\n**Exh. CL-57,** *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990, para. 21 (emphasis added).\n\n452.\n\nMore recently, the tribunal in *Urbaser* noted that a BIT \"cannot be interpreted and applied in a vacuum [...] without taking the relevant rules of international law into account\", adding that it must \"be construed in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part\".269 Similarly, in its discussion of Article 31(3)(c), the annulment committee in *Tulip v. Turkey* referred to the \"principle of systemic integration\" stating that resort to authorities stemming from fields other than investment law was a \"legitimate method of treaty interpretation\".270\n\n**Exh. RL-0353,** *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award, 8 December 2016, para. 1200.\n\n**Exh. RL-0061,** *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B. V. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID/ARB/11/28, Decision on Annulment, 30 December 2015, paras. 86-92.\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with these observations. BITs are not self-contained instruments; they are part of a wider system that integrates rules from other sources of international law, such as customary law. Such approach seems particularly apt under this particular Treaty, as the choice of law clause expressly refers to international law:\n\n\"Any tribunal established in accordance with this Section shall issue its ruling in the disputes submitted to it in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and *the applicable rules and principles of international law.* (emphasis added)\n\n454.\n\nWhile Article XV appears to be (primarily) directed to the law governing the merits, it is formulated in broad terms and may also apply to a question of jurisdiction, on which the tribunal is to issue \"its ruling in the disputes submitted to it\".271 At a minimum, Article XV shows that the Contracting Parties did not envisage that a tribunal established under the Treaty would remain within the four corners of the Treaty. To the contrary, they considered that it was entitled - and indeed under the obligation - to interpret the Treaty against the background of broader rules of international law. Like in *Urbaser v. Argentina,* \"it is thus [the Treaty\u2019s choice of law clause] itself that states the evidence that the BIT is not framed in isolation, but placed in the overall system of international law\".272\n\nSee also the similar reasoning of the *Urbaser* tribunal in respect of the applicable law clause of the BIT that applied in that dispute. The tribunal noted that: [w]hile this provision is primarily directed to the applicable law on the merits of the dispute, it may have a role to play in connection with certain specific issues to be examined concerning jurisdiction.\n\n**Exh. RL-0353,** *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award, 8 December 2016, para. 1201.\n\n**e.** ***\"Relevant\" rules of international law applicable between the parties***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nThe next question, in terms of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, is thus what international law rules applicable between the Parties are \"relevant\" and must be taken into account in interpreting the notion of \"investor\" under the Treaty.\n\n456.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the \"relevant\" international rules applicable between the parties here are the rules on nationality in the context of diplomatic protection.\n\n457.\n\nIt is generally accepted, in international practice and by commentators, that investment claims are not diplomatic protection claims.273 A key difference is that the latter are brought by the state of nationality of the injured person, whereas the former are raised by the investor directly. A second significant difference is that damages awarded in investment arbitration are paid to the claimant investor, while damages granted in diplomatic protection proceedings are paid to the state of nationality. That said, as stated in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic,* \"[tjhe fact that [investment] treaties have substituted for diplomatic protection and may even prohibit its exercise by the States that are parties to them, does not mean that the basic principles have also been automatically derogated as it is rather the means for materializing an international claim that have changed but not in all aspects its substantive requirements\".274 Indeed, both sets of protective rules (diplomatic protection and investment protection) pursue the same goal and are premised on the same connecting factor, i.e. nationality. They merely provide for different means to enforce State responsibility for the treatment of aliens. As explained by James Crawford, \"one might argue that bilateral investment treaties in some sense institutionalize and reinforce (rather than replace) the system of diplomatic protection\".275 And while BITs have advanced the protection of aliens in many respects, in the Tribunal\u2019s view this does not mean that they intended to do away with the basic underlying principles, save where States expressly said so.\n\nSee generally K.

Most of these cases dealt with shareholder claims and with the question whether the principles set out in *Barcelona Traction* could limit a claimant\u2019s right to sue under the applicable treaty.276 A few other cases discussed whether notions of \"genuine link\" or \"effective nationality\" should be read into treaty definitions of *corporate* \"investor\" that relied on the place of incorporation as the relevant test for corporate nationality.277 In both of these instances, however, the applicable treaties provided specific rules. In the case of shareholder claims, the treaties specified that \"shares\" where protected investments and included both direct and indirect\" shareholding in the scope of investments. In the case of corporate nationality, the investment treaties provided for the place of incorporation test, which is an accepted connecting factor under international law to determine the nationality of a legal entity.\n\nSee, e.g., among several, *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v.

Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, paras. 125-129 (The Respondent seeks to rely on Article 31 (3)(c) of the VCLT, arguing that the principle of real and effective nationality forms part of the relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties (MoJ, \u00a7 268). The Tribunal cannot share this view. The fundamental question is whether this Tribunal should disregard the Dutch nationality of KT Asia dictated by a plain reading of the Treaty and focus instead on the Kazakh nationality of Mr. Ablyazov, its ultimate beneficial owner\". The tribunal went on to observe that \"[t]his Tribunal sees no basis for applying a rule of diplomatic protection that would trump *the specific regime created by the Treaty.* In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the nationality of a corporation is a legal construct and that in the absence of any obligatory test for the nationality of corporations in international law, it falls to the Contracting States of the relevant investment treaty to define the nationality of a corporation as they see fit [...]. This observation is confirmed by a review of relevant decisions. Indeed, attempts by respondents to substitute or supplement the test of nationality in a BIT with rules of diplomatic protection have failed in an overwhelming number of cases. The Tribunal concurs with the wide consensus that emerges from case law according to which rules of customary international law applicable in the context of diplomatic protection do not apply where they *have been varied by the lex specialis of an investment treaty\".* All emphases added).\n\n460.\n\nIn contrast to those situations, here the Treaty is silent on an issue for which customary law on diplomatic protection provides a rule. As noted by the tribunal in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic:*\n\n\"while it is true that investment law has meant in some respects a departure from the law governing diplomatic protection and the traditional law of international claims, this is correct largely to the extent that applicable treaties and conventions *have so established by providing rules different from those of diplomatic protection.* While many such treaties, like the one now before the Tribunal, provide for rules on the definition of who is a national entitled to its protection, seldom do they provide for a rule establishing the moment at which such nationality is required. *The rules governing issues not addressed by the specific language of the treaty may sometimes be provided by the law of diplomatic protection, which apply as customary international law,* and thus, provides for a residual role for at least some aspects of the law of diplomatic protection.\"278\n\n**Exh. RL-0123,** *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale In Respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S. A. v. The Dominican Republic,* LCIA Case No. UN 7927, UNCITRAL, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, para. 108 (emphasis added).\n\n461.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal is not suggesting that all of the customary international law rules on diplomatic protection apply in the BIT context. Rather, as rightly observed by the tribunal in *Perenco v. Ecuador,* \"the field of diplomatic protection [...] may, *depending upon the issue,* be relevant to the interpretation of a BIT\".279 One such issue is dual nationality, for which recourse to the rules of diplomatic protection may usefully fill the *lacuna* in the Treaty. As Christoph Schreuer writes, \"[i] nternational legal practice on questions of nationality has developed primarily in the context of diplomatic protection [...] Until international practice develops new criteria for purposes of access to institutions like the Centre, *the rules as developed in the context of diplomatic protection remain the only reliable guidance.280*\n\n**Exh.

Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims,* Cambridge University Press (2009), p. 321 (\"Where an individual claimant with the nationality of one contracting state also has the nationality of the host contracting state party, the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* extends to such an individual only if the former nationality is the dominant of the two, subject to a contrary provision of an investment treaty or the application of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\", internal footnotes omitted).\n\n462.\n\nThis approach is consistent with the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection. Pursuant to Article 17, the Draft Articles \"do not apply *to the extent that they are inconsistent* with special rules of international law, such as treaty provisions for the protection of investments\".281 However, \"[t]o the extent that the draft articles remain consistent with the BIT in question, they continue to apply\".282 There would for instance be an inconsistency if an investment treaty excluded dual nationals through a rule similar to Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention or, conversely, stipulated expressly that dual nationals do benefit from Treaty protection. Here, there is no inconsistency. The Contracting Parties left dual nationality unaddressed, with the result that the Treaty\u2019s silence requires the Tribunal to interpret the definition of investor in light of the rules on diplomatic protection, which provide the most \"reliable guidance\" in this area283 and \"constitute the background against which the treaty\u2019s provision must be viewed [...]\".284\n\nILC Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art. 17 (emphasis added).\n\nILC Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Commentary, *ad* Art. 17, para. 3.\n\nSchreuer, *supra* para. 461.\n\n**Exh.

A useful starting point to trace the evolution is found in the 1930 Hague Convention, which states the so-called rule of \"non-responsibility\" in the following terms:\n\n**Article 4**\n\nA State may not afford diplomatic protection to one of its nationals against a State whose nationality such person also possesses.\n\n464.\n\nThe ILC Commentary to Article 7 of the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection (on which see *infra)* explains that \"[e]ven before 1930 there was [...] support in arbitral decisions for another position [other than the non-responsibility rule encapsulated in Article 4 of the 1930 Hague Convention], namely that the State of dominant or effective nationality might bring proceedings in respect of a national against another State of nationality\".285 The ICJ adopted this approach in the *Nottebohm* case of 1955. It is true that *Nottebohm* did not involve a dual national.286 Yet, as stated by the ILC, \"the Court found support for its finding that Mr. Nottebohm had no effective link with Liechtenstein in cases dealing with dual nationality\"287 or in the words of the ICJ:\n\n\"International arbitrators have decided in the same way numerous cases of dual nationality, where the question arose with regard to the exercise of protection. *They have given their preference to the real and effective nationality,* that which accorded with the facts, that based on stronger factual ties between the person concerned and one of the States whose nationality is involved.\"288\n\nILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Article 7, Commentary, para.3, with references to practice.\n\nRather, the question was whether Mr. Nottebohm who brought a diplomatic protection claim against Guatemala was a national of Liechtenstein. The Court applied a test of \"genuine and effective\" nationality and found that, given the lack of a genuine link between Liechtenstein and Mr. Nottebohm, Guatemala was not obliged to recognize his nationality.\n\nILC Commentary, fn. 80.\n\n**Exh. CL-252,** *Nottebohm,* 1955, p. 22 (emphasis added). According to Brownlie, Principles of International law, 8th ed. pp. 513-14: \"Seen in its proper perspective, the decision in Nottebohm is a reflection of a fundamental concept long present in the materials concerning nationality on the international plane. The doctrine of the effective link had already been recognized for some time in continental literature and the decisions of some national courts. That was commonly in connection with dual nationality, but the particular context does not obscure its role as a general principle with a variety of applications.\"\n\n465.\n\nIn the same year of 1955, the Italy-United States Conciliation Commission explicitly approved the real and effective nationality rule in the *Merg\u00e9* decision:\n\n\"The principle, based on the sovereign equality of States, which excludes diplomatic protection in the case of dual nationality, *must yield before the principle of predominant nationality whenever such nationality is that of the claiming State.* But it must not yield when such predominance is not proved, because the first of these two principles is generally recognized and may constitute a criterion of practical application for the elimination of any possible uncertainty.\"289\n\n*Merge case (United States v. Italy),* US-ltaly Conciliation Commission, 14 Recueil des Sentences Arbitrates (1955), p. 247.\n\n466.\n\nThe rule on dominant nationality was then applied by the Conciliation Commission in over 50 subsequent cases concerning dual nationals.290\n\nILC Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Commentary *ad* Art. 7, para. (3).\n\n467.\n\nSubsequently, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal relied on this jurisprudence to conclude that the dominant and effective test was applicable to determine the nationality of claimants under the Algiers Accords. The IUSCT jurisprudence appears particularly significant for a number of reasons. First, the dispute resolution mechanism established by the Algiers Accords presents important similarities with investment arbitration, insofar as individuals of one contracting party are granted the right to file direct claims against the other contracting party. In other words, \"the agreement of the two [Contracting Parties to the Algiers Accords] to create [the IUSCT] was not a typical exercise of diplomatic protection\", as the IUSCT acknowledged.291 Yet, despite this difference, the IUSCT relied on Article 31(3)(c) VCLT to conclude that customary international rules on nationality for diplomatic protection purposes were relevant to interpret the definition of national in the Algiers Accords, which was silent on this issue.\n\nSee IUSCT Case No. 157 *Nasser Esphahanian v. Bank Tejarat,* Final award (Award No. 31-157-2), 29 March 1983, para. 43 (\"the agreement of the two Governments to create this Tribunal was not a typical exercise of diplomatic protection of nationals in which a State, seeking some form of international redress for its nationals, creates a tribunal to which it, rather than its nationals, is a party. In that typical case, the State espouses the claims of its nationals, and the injuries for which it claims redress are deemed to be injuries to itself; here, the Government of the United States is not a party to the arbitration of claims of United States nationals, not even in the small claims where it acts as counsel for those nationals.)\n\n468.\n\nSpecifically, in 1983, in the *Nasser Esphahanian v. Bank Tejarat* case, Chamber Two of the IUSCT held that:\n\n\"In the absence of any specific provision in the Claims Settlement on this point, the Tribunal must determine the meaning of the text through use of the rules of the Vienna Convention. Paragraph 3(c) of Article 31 directs us to take into account \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\".\n\nThere is a considerable body of law, precedents and legal literature, analyzed herein, which leads to the conclusion that the applicable rule of international law is that of dominant and effective nationality.\"292\n\nSee IUSCT Case No. 157 *Nasser Esphahanian v. Bank Tejarat,* Final award (Award No. 31-157-2), 29 March 1983, paras. 23-24; IUSCT Case No. 211, *Ataollah Golpira v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,* Final award (Award No. 32-211-2), 29 March 1983 (adopting the same rule).\n\n469.\n\nThe Chamber of the IUSCT then reviewed the 1930 Hague Convention, the arbitral and judicial precedents that had followed since then (including those examined in the preceding paragraphs), as well as scholarly opinions. It noted that \"there has been a very strong tendency to limit the principle of non-responsibility, expressed in Article 4 of the Hague Convention, by the principle of effective nationality as expressed by Article 5 of the said Convention\".\n\n470.\n\nOne year later, Iran submitted to the IUSCT the interpretive question whether the tribunal had jurisdiction over dual nationals. In decision A/18, the IUSCT, sitting in full composition under the presidency of Judge Lagergren, confirmed the conclusion reached by Chamber Two in the following terms:\n\n\"Paragraph 3(c) of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention directs the Tribunal to take into account \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. There is a considerable body of law and legal literature, analyzed herein, which leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that the applicable rule of international law is that of dominant and effective nationality.293\n\nIUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision, 6 April 1984, para. 36.\n\n471.\n\nThe full tribunal examined the 1930 Hague Convention, scholarly opinions and arbitral and judicial decisions. It noted that \"whatever the state of the law prior to 1945, the better rule at the time the Algiers Declarations were concluded and today is the rule of dominant and effective nationality\". It in particular referred to *Nottebohm* and *Merge* and held that these were \"[tjhe two most important decisions on the subject in the years following the Second World War [which] have had a decisive effect\" on the recognition of the rule of dominant and effective nationality. On *Nottebohm,* in particular, the tribunal made the following remarks:\n\n\"While Nottebohm itself did not involve a claim against a State of which Nottebohm was a national, it demonstrated the acceptance and approval by the International Court of Justice of the search for the real and effective nationality based on the facts of a case, instead of an approach relying on more formalistic criteria. *The effects of the Nottebohm decision have radiated throughout the international law of nationality.294*\n\nIUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision, 6 April 1984, para. 45 (emphasis added).\n\n472.\n\nThe IUSCT went on to say:\n\n\"[...] [tjhe relevant rule of international law which the Tribunal may take into account for purposes of interpretation, as directed by Article 31, paragraph 3(c), of the Vienna Convention, is the rule that flows from the dictum of *Nottebohm,* the rule of real and effective nationality, and the search for \"stronger factual ties between the person concerned and one of the States whose nationality is involved.\" *In view of the pervasive effect of this rule since the Nottebohm decision,* the Tribunal concludes that the references to \"national\" and \"nationals\" in the Algiers Declarations must be understood as consistent with that rule *unless an exception is clearly stated.* As stated above, the Tribunal does not find that the text of the Algiers Declarations provides such a clear exception.\"295\n\nIUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision, 6 April 1984, para. 50 (emphasis added).\n\n473.\n\nSubsequently, the rule on dominant and effective nationality was consistently applied by the IUSCT in a number of cases.296\n\nILC Commentary on Diplomatic Protection, ad Art. 7, para. 3.\n\n474.\n\nIn 2006, when it concluded its work on diplomatic protection, the ILC relied on all these precedents and codified the customary rules as follows:\n\n**Article 7 Multiple nationality and claim against a State of nationality**\n\nA State of nationality may not exercise diplomatic protection in respect of a person against a State of which that person is also a national unless the nationality of the former State is predominant, both at the date of injury and at the date of the official presentation of the claim.\"\n\n475.\n\nThe ILC explained its choice of word \"predominant\" as opposed to \"dominant\" or effective in the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection by stressing the relativity involved in an inquiry about competing nationalities:\n\n\"Even though the two concepts are different, the authorities use the term \"effective\" or \"dominant\" without distinction to describe the required link between the claimant State and its national in situations in which one State of nationality brings a claim against another State of nationality. Draft article 7 does not use either of these words to describe the required link but instead uses the term \"predominant\" as it conveys the element of relativity and indicates that the individual has stronger ties with one State rather than another. A tribunal considering this question is required to balance the strengths of competing nationalities and the essence of this exercise is more accurately captured by the term \"predominant\" when applied to nationality than either \"effective\" or \"dominant. [...] the term \"predominant [...] is moreover the term used by the Italian-United States Conciliation Commission in the *Merge* claim, which may be seen as *the starting point for the development of the present customary rule.297*\n\nILC Commentary on Diplomatic Protection, *Ad* Art. 7, para. 4 (emphasis added).\n\n476.\n\nHence, it seems clear that today the customary international law rule on dual nationality in diplomatic protection claims is that of predominant nationality.298\n\nSee also, among many, Peter Spiro, *Multiple Nationality,* in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law,* para. 11 (Prior majority practice (also reflected in the 1930 Hague Convention) had barred one State of nationality from making claims or exercising protection against another State of nationality, without regard to relative actual connections. *That practice eroded during the 20th century, however, to expand the 'dominant and effective\u2019 test to apply as between States of nationality.* Thus ruled the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, for instance in 1984 (Decision No 32-A18-FT 5 Iran-United States Claims Tribunal Rep 251 [1984 I]). The approach is also adopted in the 2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art. 7 of which allows a State of nationality to exercise diplomatic protection in respect of a person against a State of which that person is also a national if the nationality of the former State is predominant.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n**g.** ***Conclusion on the rule governing dual nationals***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n477.\n\nIn sum, where, as here, the BIT fails to specify whether an investor who is a national of both the home and the host States is entitled to bring claims under the treaty, the tribunal must have recourse to the rules on diplomatic protection, which provide that it must take account of the predominant nationality.299\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a number of authors support this conclusion. See, e.g., Dolzer and Stevens, *Bilateral Investment Treaties,* Nijhoff (1995), p. 34; C. McLachlan et. al., *International Investment Arbitration, Substantive Principles,* Oxford University Press (2017), pp. 182-185; **Exh. CL-0118,** Z. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims,* Cambridge University Press (2009), p. 321; C. Dugan, D. Wallace, N. Rubins and B. Sabahi, *Investor-State Arbitration,* Oxford University Press (2008), p. 304.\n\n478.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, requiring an individual, who is a national of both the home State and host State, to have a stronger connection with the former is the position most in accord with the purpose of international investment agreements, including this Treaty, which is to provide a level playing field to foreign investors who are regarded as disadvantaged vis-\u00e0-vis domestic investors\n\n479.\n\nThis rule is also inherently fair as it ensures that, in a bilateral investment treaty scenario such as the present one, an investor of a Contracting Party (e.g., Mexico), who is *also* an investor of the other Contracting Party (e.g., Spain), is not placed at an advantage over other investors who only have the nationality of the former Contracting Party (e.g., Mexico), while at the same time ensuring that he/she is not denied the possibility of bringing a BIT claim altogether.\n\n480.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is aware that other tribunals constituted under different treaties have either denied or granted access to investor-State arbitration to dual nationals without regard to the dominant and effective nationality test.300 The Tribunal has reviewed those awards, but considers that the outcome reached here is the correct one for the reasons set out above.301\n\nSee, e.g., **Exh. CL-114,** *Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas and Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2013-3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2014; *Mohamed Abdel Raouf Bahgat v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* PCA Case 2012-07, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 November 2017; *Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v.

Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Award on Jurisdiction, 13 December 2019.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that recently the tribunal in *Fernando Fraiz Trapote v. Venezuela* (award available at https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw16446.pdf) reached a similar conclusion on the applicability of the dominant and effective nationality criterion to a dual nationality situation similar to the present one. See *Fernando Fraiz Trapote v. Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2019-11, Final Award, 31 January 2022. Additionally, while the tribunals in *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas et al v. Venezuela* and *Heemsen v. Venezuela* declined jurisdiction on other grounds, both expressed support for the use of the dominant and effective test in dual nationality claims in investment arbitration.\n\n**h.** ***The predominant nationality of the eight dual Mexican-Spanish nationals***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nHaving set out the rule that is applicable to dual nationals who claim under this Treaty in the present UNCITRAL arbitration, it remains for the Tribunal to determine the predominant nationality of the eight Claimants who hold dual Mexican-Spanish nationalities. To determine which nationality is predominant, different factors are normally taken into consideration. For instance, in *Nottebohm,* the ICJ mentioned the habitual residence of the individual concerned\" as \"an important factor\", adding that the following criteria may also be relevant: \"the centre of his interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given country and inculcated in his children, etc\".302 In its commentary, the ILC suggested similar factors, in addition to others such as \"employment and financial interests\" and \"taxation, bank account, social security insurance\".303 Both the ICJ and the ILC have underscored that none of these elements is decisive and that the weight attributed to each of them will vary according to the circumstances of each case.304\n\n**Exh. CL-252,** *Nottebohm* case *(Liechtenstein v. Guatemala),* 2nd phase, Judgment of 6 April 1995, 1995 ICJ Reports, p. 22.\n\nILC Commentary on Diplomatic Protection, *ad* Art. 7, para. 5.\n\n**Exh. CL-252,** *Nottebohm* case *(Liechtenstein v. Guatemala),* 2nd phase, Judgment of 6 April 1995, 1995 ICJ Reports, p. 22 (\"Different factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to the next [...]\"); ILC Commentary on Diplomatic Protection, *ad* Art. 7, para. 5. (None of these factors is decisive and the weight attributed to each factor will vary according to the circumstances of each case).\n\n482.\n\nTaking into account these factors, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have established that the eight dual nationals are predominantly Mexican. All of the relevant links point to Mexico, rather than Spain. Indeed, all the dual nationals reside in Mexico, are taxed in Mexico, and have family ties in Mexico. The fact that some of these individuals, including Mr. del Valle, may use their Spanish passport to enter Spain305 is of limited relevance in this context, especially where all the other connecting factors point to Mexico. Mr. del Valle also testified that over the last few years \"the most that [he] was in Spain was about one or two weeks once or twice a year\", and that he \"never had a place to live\" in Spain, but always stayed at a hotel.306 Further, Spain has not brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention any element (other than the use of the Spanish passport for travel purposes) that could imply a predominance of the Spanish nationality of these eight dual nationals.\n\nSee May Hearing Tr. [English version], 18 May 2021, 197: 1 et seq.\n\nIbid, 197: 15-21.\n\n483.\n\nIn conclusion, the predominant nationality of the eight Mexican-Spanish nationals is that of Mexico. They are thus \"investors\" protected under Article l(5)(a) of the Treaty and the Tribunal has jurisdiction over disputes between them and the Kingdom of Spain. Spain\u2019s *ratione personae* objection is accordingly denied.\n\n**F.** **\"Clean Hands\"**\n------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nSpain argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or the claims are inadmissible on the ground of the \"clean hands\" and similar doctrines,307 according to which investors who engage in abusive, bad faith, or unlawful conduct \"in the realisation and development of the investment\" are denied treaty protection.308\n\nSoD, paras. 701-711; Rejoinder, paras. 833-859; R-PHB1, para. 34; R-PHB2, para. 17.\n\nRejoinder, para. 833.

They were subject to criminal investigations for allegedly leaking confidential information obtained through Banco Popular\u2019s Board of Directors in order to drive down Banco Popular\u2019s share price and take control over it.309 Other Claimants may also have been engaged in or, at least, aware of such misconduct.310 Moreover, Spanish authorities are also investigating Banco Popular\u2019s 2016 capital increase for accounting irregularities and, so Spain alleges, there is substantial evidence against [REDACTED].311\n\nSoD, para. 704, referring to **Exh.

The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the \"clean hands\" doctrine does not apply here and that, in any event, Spain failed to prove any illegal act by [REDACTED]. They also observe that the investigations concern only two Claimants out of 54.312\n\nReply, paras. 419-427; C-PHB1, paras. 375-378; C-PHB2, para. 216.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n487.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s allegations of illegal conduct pertain to both the Claimants\u2019 making of their investment in Spain and activities post-dating the investment.\n\n488.\n\nUnder Articles IX(1) and XI of the Treaty, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to \"[a]ny dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and an *investor* of the other Contracting Party due to alleged non-compliance with an obligation under this Agreement\" (emphasis added). An investor pursuant to Article l(5) of the Treaty is an individual or company of the other Contracting Party \"which has made an *investment* in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" (emphasis added). The term \"investment\", in turn, is defined in Article l(4) of the Treaty as the \"assets owned or controlled by investors of one of the Contracting Parties and *established in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legislation of the latter\"* (emphasis added).\n\n489.\n\nTherefore, for the present dispute to come within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, it must have arisen out of assets \"established [...] in accordance with the legislation\" of Spain. The ordinary meaning of this formulation leaves no doubt that it requires that investments be \"established\", or in other words \"made\" in accordance with local law. By contrast, the Treaty does not address the consequences of any illegal activities in which the investor may engage *after* making the investment.\n\n490.\n\nThat said, as recalled in the context of the analysis in respect of nationality, the Tribunal\u2019s mandate under the Treaty does not exist in isolation, but in the framework of general international law (see *supra* section VI.E.3.d). The rule of systemic integration dictates that the Tribunal take into account general principles that govern the exercise of jurisdiction, one of such principles being that claims tainted by serious wrongdoings are not admissible.313\n\nSee generally *Bank Melli Iran and Bank Saderat Iran v. Bahrain,* PCA Case No. 2017-25, Award, 9 November 2021, paras. 373.; **Exh. RL-0079,** *Al Warraq v. Indonesia,* Final Award, 15 December 2014, paras. 645-646; **Exh.

Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 and 12/14, Award, 6 December 2016, paras. 507-508.\n\n491.\n\nIndeed, international tribunals have commonly recognized that claims involving wrongful conduct are inadmissible, be it under the doctrine of clean hands, international public policy, or other general principles such as the principle of good faith, ex *turpi causa non oritur actio,* or *nemo auditur propiam turpitudinem allegans.* However, to result in the inadmissibility of the claims, the investor\u2019s unlawful conduct must be severe.314\n\n*Bank Meili Iran and Bank Saderat Iran v.

The Government of Mongolia and MonAtom LLC,* PCA Case No. 2011-09, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 July 2012, para. 384.\n\n492.\n\nOn the basis of the record, the Tribunal finds that Spain has not even come close to establishing that, either in the making or carrying out their investments, any of the Claimants has engaged in wrongdoing, let alone severe wrongdoing, that would entail lack of jurisdiction or the inadmissibility of the claims. Spain has first referred to \"press reports\"315 and subsequently to \"ongoing investigations\"316, maintaining that the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction or claims would be inadmissible *\"[i]f* these allegations are confirmed\".317 This very wording shows that there is no proof of wrongdoing. Moreover, press reports cannot substitute for established facts and the Tribunal has not been shown any record of the \"ongoing investigations\" referred to. Neither has it seen any court decision or other finding concluding that [REDACTED] have committed illegal acts. Similarly, the evidence on record contains no indication of unlawful conduct. As a result, Spain\u2019s objection can only be denied.\n\nSoD, para. 701.\n\nRejoinder, 833.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 34 (emphasis added). See also Rejoinder, para. 858 (\"If confirmed, this should result in the present Claim being declared inadmissible\").\n\n**VI. LIABILITY**\n-----------------\n\n**A.** **Introduction**\n-----------------------\n\n493.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal addresses the claims. Before doing so, it is useful to briefly set out the applicable principles on burden and standard of proof.\n\n494.\n\nAs a general matter, since the claims brought in this arbitration seek to establish the responsibility of a State for breach of the latter\u2019s international obligations, it is appropriate to apply international law to the burden of proof. The principle that each party has the burden of proving the facts on which it relies is widely recognized and applied by international courts and tribunals. The International Court of Justice as well as investment treaty tribunals have characterized this rule as a general principle of law.318 Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules also provides that each party has the *burden* of proving the facts on which it relies in support of its claim or defense. Thus, the Claimants bear the burden of proof.319\n\nSee, e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua,* I.C. J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101. See also in the investment arbitration context *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 237.\n\nThis principle appears undisputed. See Reply, paras. 470-471 (\"Claimants agree with Respondent that they have the burden of proving their claims that Respondent violated the Treaty); Rejoinder, para. 860.\n\n495.\n\nA different matter is the applicable *standard* of proof, which relates to the degree of certainty required for a tribunal to find that a fact is proven. The formulations of the applicable standard of proof under international law vary across tribunals. Some refer to common law standards such as balance of probabilities and preponderance of evidence. Others use the civil law notion of *intime conviction du juge* or \"inner conviction of the judge\". Others still adopt the standard of reasonable certainty, which appears close to *intime conviction.320* Commentators note that, while the labels differ, there is no real difference in practice.321 The Tribunal also notes that Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the tribunal \"shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality *and weight of the evidence offered,322* which confers \"wide discretion\" to tribunals in the assessment of the evidence.323 Hence, the Tribunal enjoys wide discretion in the weighing of the evidence and determining whether a fact alleged is established. In the exercise of this discretion, it will apply the standard of reasonable certainty.\n\nSee, e.g., *BSG Resources Limited (in administration), BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) S\u00c0RL v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22, Award, 18 May 2022 [Redacted], para. 493, with further references. See also **Exh. CL-291,** *Crystallex International Corporation v.

Laird, *Evidence in International Investment Arbitration,* paras. 5.17 ff, with further references.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, Article 27(4) (emphasis added).\n\nDavid D. Caron and Lee M. Caplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. A Commentary* (2nd ed., 2013), pp. 572-574, citing in particular P. Sanders, *Commentary on the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,* in 1977 II Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, p. 203, who explains that the discretion \"of arbitrators to evaluate the evidence offered by the parties is phrased in the broadest terms possible\".\n\n496.\n\nStill in connection with evidentiary matters, the Parties have discussed whether it is appropriate to \"lower\" the standard of proof or shift the burden to the other Party in certain circumstances. Specifically, the Claimants request that the Tribunal apply a standard of proof that is \"lower than the usual preponderance of evidence\" and shift the burden of proof to the Respondent where \"the [R]espondent state has exclusive control over evidence related to the [Claimants\u2019] case and has taken steps to deny Claimants access to relevant evidence\".324 Pointing in particular to the so-called Withheld Documents,325 the Claimants submit that \"[t]he only appropriate means to address this imbalance of power and evidence is to adjust the applicable standard of proof [...], by allowing Claimants to utilize adverse factual inferences, rely upon circumstantial evidence and *ultimately to shift the burden of proof to Respondent.326*\n\nReply, para. 474.

Therefore, in reliance on Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules quoted above, which empowers it to assess the weight of the evidence adduced, the Tribunal in its discretion may determine whether the burden of proof should be shifted or the standard lowered and ultimately whether an alleged fact can be deemed established under the circumstances.\n\nSee *Metal-Tech Ltd. v.

Unlike the previous BIT between Mexico and Spain, the current Treaty refers to \"international customary law\", which shows the States\u2019 intention to limit the scope of the FET standard to the minimum standard of treatment.342\n\nSoD, paras. 728-730.\n\n506.\n\nFurthermore, Spain\u2019s interpretation was confirmed in *Abengoa v.

In July 2001, the NAFTA Contracting States clarified that Article 1105(1) \"prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party\".

The Claimants have failed to demonstrate that (i) Spain granted more favorable treatment to non-Mexican investors; (ii) the investments of the non-Mexican investors were in circumstances similar to the Claimants\u2019 investments; (iii) the difference in treatment was due to nationality; and (iv) the difference in treatment was not based on objective criteria and reasonable public policy. For these reasons, the MFN clause cannot be used to import the FET standard from the Spain-Libya or Spain-Dominican Republic BITs.348\n\nSoD, paras. 753-774; Rejoinder, paras. 1004-1030.\n\n510.\n\nMoreover, it is the Respondent\u2019s submission that, even if the so-called \"autonomous\" standard were to apply in this case, the obligations imposed on Spain under such standard are different from those described by the Claimants:\n\na. With regard to *non-arbitrariness,* a conduct is arbitrary only if it violates \"the rule of law\" *(ELSI* standard);349\n\nb. Concerning *non-discrimination,* the Claimants must prove \"objectively\" that they were treated differently from other investors in similar circumstances;350\n\nc. *Transparency* is not part of the FET standard. Alternatively, only a \"manifest\", \"gross\", \"complete\" lack of transparency would be capable of triggering State responsibility;351\n\nd. Further, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable framework does not form part of the FET standard either. . In any event, the Claimants fails to address the threshold against which a State would be held liable, which would be an extremely high one: \"complete dismantling of the very legal framework constructed to attract investors.\"352\n\nSoD, paras. 776-780, referring to **Exh.

Each Contracting Party shall give to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party *treatment in accordance with international customary law, including fair and equitable treatment,* as well as full protection and security.\n\n2. A resolution to the effect that another provision of this Agreement or of a separate international agreement has been violated shall not establish that this article has been violated\".354\n\n**Exh. C-1,** Treaty, Article IV (emphasis added).\n\n513.\n\nIn accordance with the rules of interpretation set out above (see *supra* para. 246), the Tribunal starts with the text of the Treaty.355 In its original Spanish wording, Article IV is titled *\"[n]ivel m\u00ednimo de trato,* which is translated as [m]inimum level of treatment\" in the unofficial English version of the BIT. The text of the provision then refers to \"treatment in accordance with international customary law, including fair and equitable treatment\". A textual interpretation of the clause, including its title, leaves no doubt that the standard contained in Article IV of the Treaty is the minimum standard of treatment in accordance with customary international law.\n\nSee **Exh. CL-239,** *Libya v. Chad,* [i]interpretation must be based above all upon the text of the treaty (Territorial Dispute *(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. Chad),* Judgment, ICJ Reports 1994, p. 22, para. 41).\n\n514.\n\nThe Claimants have not provided any element that would contradict this conclusion, such as for instance an agreement between the Contracting Parties or an instrument made by one Party and accepted by the other Party \"in connection with the conclusion of the treaty\" (Article 31(2)(a) and (b) VCLT), or any subsequent agreement or practice within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the VCLT.\n\n515.\n\nThe arbitral awards invoked by the Claimants are equally unhelpful, as the applicable FET provisions at issue in those cases referred to either \"international law\" or \"principles of international law\", and not to the \"minimum\" standard or \"customary\" international law.356 As noted by Spain, the decision that is most apposite is *Abengoa v. Mexico,* which applied the same Treaty and came to the same conclusion as this Tribunal:\n\n\"[t]here is no doubt that Article IV of the [Treaty] refers to the minimum level of treatment in accordance with customary international law\".357\n\nFor instance, the Argentina-France BIT which was at issue in *Vivendi v. Argentina* provided for \"fair and equitable treatment according to the principles of international law\". See **Exh. CL-10,** *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, paras. 7.4.1-7.4.7. Similarly, the Canada-Venezuela BIT applicable in *Rusoro v. Venezuela* set forth that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the principles of international law, accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\". See **Exh. CL-13,** *Rusoro Mining Ltd. V. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, para. 510. Furthermore, the U.S.-Argentina BIT applicable in *Azurix v. Argentina* provided that \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than required by international law\". The tribunal noted that \"[t]he paragraph consists of three full statements, each listing in sequence a standard of treatment to be accorded to investments: fair and equitable, full protection and security, not less than required by international law. Fair and equitable treatment is listed separately\". See **Exh. CL-11,** *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, para. 361.\n\n**Exh. CL-12,** *Abengoa S.A v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/2, Award, 18 April 2013, para. 640.\n\n516.\n\nIn summary, Article IV enshrines the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. This being so, the Parties diverge on the content of that standard. Such content and its evolution have been discussed at length by scholars and arbitral tribunals, especially in the context of Article 1105 of the NAFTA, a provision that bears the same Spanish title *(\"[n]ivel m\u00ednimo de trato)* and contains very similar wording to Article IV of the Treaty.358\n\nWhile the text of Article IV refers to \"international *customary* law\", the text of Article 1105 of the NAFTA refers to \"treatment in accordance with international law\". In 2001, the Free Trade Commission interpreted Article 1105 as \"prescrib[ing] the *customary* international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\". See **Exh. RL-0166,** NAFTA, Free Trade Commission, Notes of interpretation of certain provisions under Chapter 11, 31 July 2001.\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the content of the minimum standard of treatment was appropriately articulated in *Waste Management II.* The Waste *Management II* tribunal first reviewed relevant case law under NAFTA and noted that prior decisions had \"rejected any suggestion that the standard of treatment of a foreign investment set by NAFTA is confined to the kind of outrageous treatment referred to in the *Neer* case, i.e. to treatment amounting to an 'outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\u2019\".359 It then described conduct in breach of the minimum standard in the following terms:\n\n\"98 [...] the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\n\n99. Evidently the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case. [...]\"\n\n**Exh. RL-0162,** *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 93.\n\n518.\n\nThe use in *Waste Management II* of intensifying adjectives or adverbs such as \"manifest\", \"complete\" or \"grossly\" for certain characteristics of non-conforming conduct makes it clear that acts or omissions constituting a breach must be of a serious nature.360 The enumeration of these characteristics conveys the idea that there is a high threshold for the conduct of a host State to rise to the level of a breach, although there is no requirement that the challenged conduct reach the level of shocking or outrageous behavior.\n\nSee also **Exh. CL-262,** *Bilcon of Delaware et. al., v. Government of Canada* (NAFTA), UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015, para. 443.\n\n519.\n\nOn this basis, and to the extent relevant to the facts pleaded in this case, the Tribunal considers that the following types of conduct are prohibited by Article IV of the Treaty: arbitrariness; \"gross\" unfairness, injustice or idiosyncratic conduct; discrimination; \"complete\" lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process; lack of due process \"leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\"; and \"manifest failure\" of natural justice in judicial proceedings. Further, the Tribunal shares the view held by a majority of tribunals acting under a treaty where the FET clause was confined to the minimum standard of treatment361 that the failure to respect an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations in and of itself does not constitute a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, but is an element to take into account when assessing whether other components of the standard are breached.\n\nSee, e.g., **Exh. RL-0162,** *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 98 (quoted supra in the text); **Exh. RL-0165,** *Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para. 296; **Exh. RL-0254,** *Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of* Canada Award, 24 March 2016, para. 502.\n\n520.\n\nFinally, when elucidating the content of the minimum standard of treatment, one should further take into consideration that international law requires tribunals to afford an appropriate level of deference to the manner in which a State exercises the discretion which it enjoys under the domestic law. A number of investment tribunals operating both under the minimum standard and autonomous notions of FET have acknowledged the requirement for deference.362\n\nSee, among others, **Exh. RL-0189,** *Les Laboratories Servier, S.A.S., Biofarma, S.A.S. and Arts et Techniques du Progres S.A.S. v. Republic of Poland,* UNCITRAL, Award, 14 February 2012, para. 568; **Exh. CL-291,** *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, paras. 583-585; *Muszynianka v. Slovakia,* PCA Case. 2017-08, Award, 7 October 2020, para. 558.\n\n521.\n\nThat being said, deference to the primary decision-makers cannot be unfettered, as otherwise a host state would be entirely shielded from state responsibility and the standards of protection contained in BITs would be rendered nugatory.363 As noted by the tribunal in *RREEF v. Spain,* \"discretionary\" cannot be equated with \"arbitrary\".364 Or, in the words of the tribunal in *Unglaube v. Costa Rica:*\n\ndeference [...] is not without limits. Even if such measures are taken for an important public purpose, governments [...] will not be excused from liability if their action has been arbitrary or discriminatory\".365\n\nSee **Exh. CL-291,** *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, para. 584; *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 468.\n\nSee *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 468.\n\n**Exh. CL-277,** *Marion & Reinhard Unglaube v. The Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB/08/1 and ARB/09/20, Award, 16 May 2012, para. 247 (internal footnote omitted).\n\n522.\n\nDifferently put, \"a tribunal cannot simply put itself in the position of the S[t]ate and weigh the measure anew, particularly with hindsight\".366 This is especially so where hefty and potentially costly decisions must be taken and in situations requiring the State to act with urgency. Hence, rather than assessing whether in a given situation the Spanish authorities acted adequately or correctly, the Tribunal must examine whether Spain\u2019s actions show serious flaws which resulted in the Claimants\u2019 being treated in a manner inconsistent with the standard articulated above. It is with this standard of review in mind that the Tribunal will scrutinize Spain\u2019s conduct under Article IV.\n\n*Koch Minerals S\u00e0rl and Koch Nitrogen International S\u00e0rl v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/19, Award, 30 October 2017, para. 7.20. See also *Casinos Austria International GmbH and Casinos Austria Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/32, Award, 05 November 2021, para. 340.\n\n523.\n\nBefore turning to the review of the impugned measures, the Tribunal must address the Claimants\u2019 submission that they are entitled to a less restrictive FET standard by operation of the MFN clause contained in Article III(1) of the Treaty. Considering the facts of this dispute, the Tribunal is of the view that it may leave open whether an MFN clause such as the one contained in the Treaty allows the Claimants to import a less stringent FET standard. As further explained in section VI.B.2.g below, even if the Tribunal were to adopt a more generous FET standard, the outcome of its analysis would remain the same.\n\n**2. Challenged measures**\n--------------------------\n\n524.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions, the Claimants have argued that a myriad of measures which Spain enacted, or failed to enact, breached Article IV of the Treaty. The presentation of these allegedly wrongful measures has somewhat evolved in the course of the proceedings.367 In sum, as argued in their Reply, the Claimants have complained of five categories of allegedly wrongful acts, which are addressed in this order in the following sections: (i) the deposit withdrawals;368 (ii) the statements and \"non-statements\" by Spanish officials;369 (iii) the failure to prohibit short sales of Banco Popular shares;370 (iv) the failure to grant the Emergency liquidity assistance (\"ELA\");371 and (v) the resolution of Banco Popular and the sale to Santander.372\n\nSee, e.g., SoC, section III.A.3-7 (where the Claimants argued their FET case by \"sub-elements\" of the standard); Reply, section IV.B.2 (where the Claimants presented the allegedly wrongful measures in the five categories mentioned *infra* in the text).\n\nReply, section IV.B.2.a (entitled \"Respondent\u2019s Massive Deposit Withdrawals from [Banco Popular]\").\n\nReply, section IV.B.2.b (entitled \"Respondent\u2019s harmful public statements and 'non-statements\u2019\").\n\nReply, section IV.B.2.C (entitled Respondent\u2019s Failure to Prohibit Short Sales\").\n\nReply, section IV.B.2.d (entitled Respondent\u2019s Failure to Provide ELA\").\n\nReply, section IV.B.2.e (entitled \"Respondent Engineered [Banco PopularJ\u2019s Resolution and the Sham Auction that Resulted in the Fire Sale to Banco Santander\").\n\n**a.** ***Deposit withdrawals***\n--------------------------------\n\n**i.** ***The Claimants\u2019 position***\n------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in 2015 and 2016, Spain\u2019s public entities made massive deposit withdrawals of approximately \u20ac 14 billion, and continued to withdraw critical deposits in 2017, in violation of the FET standard.373 These withdrawals contributed to Banco Popular\u2019s liquidity shortage and subsequently led to Banco Popular\u2019s resolution. Spain was aware of such withdrawals,374 yet failed to take appropriate steps to mitigate their effects.375\n\nSoC, paras. 26(a), 339-378; Reply, paras. 556-585; C-PHB1, paras. 65-69; C-PHB2, paras. 23-29.\n\nReply, para. 580, referring to **Exh.

See also C-PHB1, para. 64; C-PHB2, para. 29.\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimants challenge Spain\u2019s argument that the withdrawals were reasonable, as Spain failed to cite any internal policies that the agencies allegedly followed in making those withdrawals. In any event, the Respondent failed to prove that such policies should prevail over Spain\u2019s obligation to prevent Banco Popular from failing.376\n\nReply, para. 561. See also C-PHB1, paras. 67, 69.\n\n**ii.** ***The Respondent\u2019s position***\n---------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nSpain argues that the Claimants have not established that the public withdrawals breached FET.377 First, Spain had no duty to monitor or impose restrictions on deposit withdrawals,378 especially where Banco Popular was a so-called \"significant\" institution supervised by the ECB.379 Second, the Claimants failed to prove that Spanish public entities conspired against Banco Popular, especially considering that individuals and private entities were also withdrawing their deposits from Banco Popular.380 Spain notes that 70% of total withdrawals were effected by individuals and private entities,381 whereas deposits by State-related entities increased by almost \u20ac 1 billion between late 2016 and June 2017.382 Third, Spanish public entities withdrew their deposits in accordance with the terms of their deposit agreements and internal policies. The reasons for such withdrawals were legitimate,383 *inter alia* because Spanish public entities had a responsibility to safeguard public funds.384\n\nSoD, paras. 819-832; Rejoinder, paras. 273-301; R-PHB1, paras. 84-94; R-PHB2, paras. 23-31.\n\nSoD, para. 820; Rejoinder, para. 1097; R-PHB1, para. 87; R-PHB2, para. 49.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1097, referring to **Exh.

This temporal limitation restricts the scope of its examination as a significant part of the withdrawals occurred before that date.386 Second, the Tribunal notes that it has jurisdiction over claims about the deposit withdrawals to the extent that they concern acts or omissions taken *by the Respondent in the exercise of sovereign powers.387*\n\nSee *supra* 383-409.\n\nSee 391.\n\nSee *supra* 294.\n\n529.\n\nIn this latter respect, the Claimants argue that the \"Respondent had effective tools at its disposal to quell a panic-driven run on deposits\".388 They submit that \"[a]t a time when Respondent knew that depositors were at risk of developing irrational fears about the safety of their deposits with [Banco Popular], Respondent stoked those fears by allowing its agencies to withdraw massive sums from the bank\".389 In particular, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent should have resorted to the \"the ability of the [Bank of Spain] or the Ministry of Economy *to order the suspension of deposit withdrawals* in order to safeguard the stability of the banking system\".390 The Claimants also contend that, among the steps that Spain should have taken \"to reassure the market and depositors\", \"[t]he [Bank of Spain] should have alerted Spanish authorities about the excessive withdrawals from public authorities and then considered all possible means to strengthen [Banco Popular\u2019s] deposit holdings\".391\n\nC-PHB1, para. 231.\n\nReply, para. 562.\n\nReply, para. 561 (emphasis added).\n\nReply, para. 575, citing to CER-5, paras. 7.19-20. See also CER-6, paras. 65-70.\n\n530.\n\nIn support of these arguments, the Claimants have particularly relied on the expert evidence of Dr. de la Mano and Prof. Goldstein. The former explained that \"the [Bank of Spain] and the [Ministry of Economy] had the responsibility to monitor withdrawals by public institutions as well as to guide and inform deposit withdrawal decisions\".392 The latter opined that \"withdrawals by government entities serve[d] as a negative signal for other depositors, and so such withdrawals can lead to an amplification of withdrawals and significant worsening of the liquidity crisis\" and that it was \"surprising that Spanish government entities did the opposite of what would be expected with respect to their deposits in Banco Popular\".393 Relying on Prof. Goldstein\u2019s testimony at the hearing, the Claimants further contend that \"even if Respondent could not have prohibited such withdrawals, Respondent should, at a minimum, have sought to understand the effects of continuing public deposit withdrawals on [Banco Popular\u2019s] liquidity position and taken appropriate steps to mitigate the effects of these substantial withdrawals\".394\n\nCER-5, para. 7.20.\n\nCER-6, para. 69.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 66.\n\n531.\n\nThe rules on burden of proof provide that it is for the party alleging a fact to prove that fact. It is thus the Claimants\u2019 burden to show that Spain had an obligation to prevent the deposit withdrawals and that its failure to do so violated FET. By contrast, it is not for Spain to demonstrate that the deposit withdrawals are justified, as the Claimants appear to suggest in some of their submissions.395\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB1, para. 65 (Respondent has never adequately explained its deposit withdrawals.\").\n\n532.\n\nOn the basis of the record, the Tribunal finds that neither the Ministry of Economy, nor the Bank of Spain, nor any other organ of the Respondent had an obligation to take specific steps to prevent the Spanish agencies, municipalities, and state-owned entities from withdrawing their funds from their Banco Popular accounts, which withdrawals conformed to the terms of the deposit agreements.\n\n533.\n\nIn particular, neither the Claimants nor their experts have referred to any rule requiring Spain to monitor or limit deposit withdrawals by its organs and state-owned entities when the withdrawals risked harming a bank, its shareholders or creditors.\n\n534.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants referred to Spain\u2019s \"supervisory powers over the solvency and conduct of credit institutions and other financial auxiliaries, which it exercises either independently or as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism ('SSM\u2019) in the euro area, cooperating with other national supervisors in the area of their respective powers\". In the Claimants\u2019 view, these powers *\"necessarily include* [...] collaborating with other agencies to reduce government withdrawals\".396 Beyond these broad statements, the Claimants have pointed to no legal basis allowing, let alone obliging, Spain to order its public entities to suspend withdrawals. At the hearing, the Claimants\u2019 expert Dr. de la Mano was asked to indicate \"what provisions of law made the Ministry of Economy or Bank of Spain responsible from preventing public entities, including local government or State-owned entities from withdrawing deposits from Banco Popular\".397 His response was: \"the answer is no, there is no provision of law\".398\n\nReply, para. 582 (emphasis added).\n\nMay Hearing Tr. [English version], 22 May 2021, 949: 11-15.\n\nMay Hearing Tr. [English version], 22 May 2021, 950: 20-21.\n\n535.\n\nFurthermore, and leaving aside the lack of any statutory obligation, the Claimants and their experts have also failed to show that taking steps to prevent the public entities from withdrawing funds from a private bank would have been in accordance with appropriate regulatory practice. In particular, they have not referred to any document, precedent, or authority to support a finding that monitoring the withdrawals, or directing their *suspension,* would have been the \"expected\" regulatory practice in the circumstances. With regard to Prof. Goldstein\u2019s explanation that a State \"would be expected\" to act in such a fashion to counter the \"negative signal for other depositors\",399 the Tribunal considers that there is at least equal merit in Spain\u2019s refutation that an instruction to cease the withdrawals could have been counterproductive, as the market may have perceived it as a warning about Banco Popular\u2019s financial status. In the circumstances, the Tribunal sees nothing arbitrary or grossly unfair in Spain not taking action in respect of the deposit withdrawals.\n\nCER-6, para. 69 (opining that \"it is important to emphasize that withdrawals by government entities serve as a negative signal for other depositors, and so such withdrawals can lead to an amplification of withdrawals and significant worsening of the liquidity crisis. This is because withdrawals by the government might be perceived as containing negative information about the bank or indicating that the government does not intend to support it. Recall that the role of the government in a liquidity crisis is to inject liquidity and provide reassuring statements, partly because this helps to calm the panic. By the same token, an act of withdrawal by a government entity can amplify panic because markets may read it as a statement expressing a lack of confidence. Hence, *it is surprising that Spanish government entities did the opposite of what would be expected* with respect to their deposits in Banco Popular\", emphasis added).\n\n536.\n\nNor is the Tribunal persuaded by Dr. de la Mano\u2019s suggestion that, to avoid any stigmatizing effect, the directions to stop the withdrawals could have been given \"privately\".400 Even assuming such instructions may have been given confidentially, the possibility that the instructions may have leaked was not remote given the number of entities involved, with the result that the confidential nature of the acts would have increased any negative perception.\n\nCER-2, para. 1.91 (\"The [Ministry of Economy] has control or influence over some of the entities withdrawing funds from [Banco Popular]. It is difficult to understand why the [Ministry of Economy] would not have communicated, at least privately, an instruction not to withdraw significant deposits, particularly since all supervisory and regulatory authorities agreed that [Banco Popular] was solvent. There is no evidence that the [Ministry of Economy] or the [Bank of Spain] acted to limit the withdrawal of massive deposits by public institutions\").\n\n537.\n\nFinally, the Claimants rely on the testimony of Mr. de Guindos, the then Ministry of Economy, before the *Audiencia National* to argue that Spain\u2019s conduct was improper. As reported in a press statement, Mr. de Guindos gave the following testimony before the *Audiencia National:*\n\n\"De Guindos said on Wednesday that he and then-Secretary of State for the Economy Irene Garrido contacted public bodies to try to stop the withdrawal of deposits, but it was impossible, because these institutions have their own criteria, embodied in their bylaws, to preserve their investments.\"401\n\nReply, para. 185; **Exh. C-361 ENG,** Europa Press, *Guindos unsuccessfully probed a large bank to buy Popular and asked to publish the SRI report,* 30 September 2020; See also **Exh. C-360 ENG,** *De Guindos asserts that none of the five big Spanish Banks wanted to buy Popular in 2017,* 30 September 2020.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal sees nothing in this short press report that suggests that the Respondent\u2019s conduct breached its international law obligations. To the contrary, the press report confirms that the governmental authorities in fact made an attempt to stop the withdrawals, but were unable to do so because these government bodies follow their own rules or policies with a view to protecting their assets. Moreover, the Claimants have not established that the Respondent was under an obligation to take \"further action\"402 and that failure to do so was a breach of the FET standard.\n\nReply, para. 580.\n\n539.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no basis for the assertion that in the circumstances the Respondent was required to take steps to put an end to the deposit withdrawals. Neither is there any indication in the record that it somehow coordinated the withdrawals in order to destroy Banco Popular.403 Hence, Spain\u2019s conduct cannot be said to have been arbitrary, unfair, not to speak of \"grossly\" unfair, or otherwise contrary to the minimum standard of treatment enshrined in Article IV.\n\nSee SoC, para. 26(a).\n\n**b.** ***Statements and \"non-statements\" of public officials***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i.** ***The Claimants\u2019 position***\n------------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain violated the FET standard by (i) failing to publicly support Banco Popular; (ii) making public announcements that harmed Banco Popular; and (iii) failing to correct certain statements by EU authorities about Banco Popular.404\n\nSee SoC, paras. 336-378; Reply, paras. 586-613; C-PHB1, paras. 47-63, 79; C-PHB2, paras. 12-19.\n\n541.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that Spain was obliged to publicly reassure Banco Popular\u2019s depositors. Nothing prevented Spain from speaking out in support of Banco Popular, as it did for other Spanish banks, including Catalunya Banc, BMN and Liberbank. Spain\u2019s failure to support the bank, so say the Claimants, is therefore arbitrary and discriminatory.405 The \"constructive ambiguity\" doctrine, invoked by Spain at the hearing to show that the public statements were neutral and truthful, lacks credibility.406\n\nSoC, paras. 26, 342, 355, 358.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 27, 71-82; C-PHB2, paras. 20-22.\n\n542.\n\nSecond, the Respondent\u2019s officials made arbitrary and discriminatory public statements implying that Spain would not support Banco Popular. This aggravated Banco Popular\u2019s liquidity crisis and caused the share price to drop. The Claimants refer to the following statements made by Mr. de Guindos, then Minister of Economy, and Ms. Garrido, then Secretary of the Department of Economy and Support to the Companies of the Ministry of Economy, and stress that Spain did not present these two officials as witnesses and gave no reasonable explanation for their detrimental statements:407\n\n\u2022 Mr. Luis de Guindos\u2019 \"negative\" statement of 10 April 2017;408\n\n\u2022 Ms. Irene Garrido\u2019s statement of 12 April 2017, according to which Banco Popular needed \"private solutions\" because it was a \"private bank,\" thereby suggesting that the bank was on its own and would not receive any governmental support;409\n\n\u2022 Mr. Luis de Guindos\u2019 statement of 19 April 2017, where he implied that the bank would not receive any public support;410 and\n\n\u2022 Mr. Luis de Guindos\u2019 statement of 18 May 2017, by which he implied that Banco Popular was the EU\u2019s problem, rather than Spain\u2019s, and Spanish depositors were on their own.411\n\nReply, paras. 589-596; C-PHB1, para. 56-58; C-PHB2, paras. 12, 15.\n\nSoC, para. 157; Reply, para. 125, 589-592; C-PHB1 para. 51(a), discussing **Exh.

Moreover, on 12 May 2017, Ms. Garrido made a positive statement about the bank.418 Third, Spain disputes being under an obligation to correct public statements made by the EU authorities, as the FET standard does not require States to do anything within their power to advance the interests of foreign investors.419\n\nSoD, paras. 833-840; Rejoinder, paras. 308-317; R-PHB1, paras. 95-109; R-PHB2, paras. 52-64.\n\nSoD, para. 834; Rejoinder, paras. 310, 318; R-PHB1, paras. 95-105; R-PHB 2, paras. 52-64.\n\nSoD, para. 841-845; Rejoinder, paras. 315-317; R-PHB1, paras. 105-106; R-PHB2, paras. 62-64.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 60, referring to **CER-1-50,** Expansion, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 316-317; R-PHB1, paras. 106-107.\n\n**iii.** ***Discussion***\n-------------------------\n\n546.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain breached FET by making \"unprecedented and alarming public statements that effectively announced to the public and to depositors that Banco Popular was on its own and would receive no state assistance, thus contributing to the loss of confidence that caused the bank run in the first place\".420 In addition to \"negative\" statements (addressed below under (a)), the Claimants contend that Spain\u2019s officials failed to make certain \"positive\" statements to support of Banco Popular or *to correct* declarations made by other actors (addressed below under (b)).\n\nSoC, para. 26(a)(ii).\n\n547.\n\nBefore looking at the specific statements and non-statements, a few general observations are in order. First, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 expert Prof. Goldstein that \"statements that are negative in nature or that cause doubts about the commitment of the central bank might amplify a panic and make it much more severe\", which explains why \"regulators are cautious before releasing bad assessments on a bank to the public\".421 In other words, given the weight of the perceptions in the market and the role of confidence for the stability of a bank, it is not seriously in dispute that national authorities must be prudent when communicating about a bank.\n\nCER-3, para. 30.\n\n548.\n\nThat said, the role of the Tribunal in this context is limited to assessing whether certain statements or non-statements breached FET, because they were \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust\", \"idiosyncratic\", or \"discriminatory\".422 By contrast, the standard will not be breached if the Tribunal were to find, in hindsight, that a statement could have been nuanced or a given message conveyed more carefully or more forcefully. For there to be a breach of Article IV, the statement must be discriminatory, lacking any rational basis, or displaying evident and serious administrative negligence on the part of the public authorities. Furthermore, the standard is particularly high when the allegation at issue is that the State *failed to make a declaration.* Indeed, it should not be assumed lightly that a State must make a statement and the failure to do so engages its international responsibility. There may be myriad reasons why national authorities with the knowledge of the facts at the relevant time decide to remain silent, and it is not for the Tribunal to second-guess those reasons in hindsight.\n\n**Exh. RL-0162,** Waste *Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 98.\n\n549.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the markets may have reacted negatively to a certain statement, as evidenced in particular by a decrease in the stock price, does not in itself show that the statement at issue was grossly unfair, idiosyncratic or discriminatory. In reality, it is not always possible to isolate the effect of a statement on the share price, especially where around the same time other events may have contributed to strong fluctuations in the market and to a loss of confidence in Banco Popular. In this case, the allegedly controversial statements were made in April and May 2017 and coincide with a number of other occurrences which may have affected the market capitalization of Banco Popular. Specifically, the (non-)statements fell into the time frame when (i) Banco Popular released the results of an internal audit of its credit portfolio identifying certain issues related to the capital raise of 2016, which concluded that Banco Popular\u2019s 2016 financial statements would not need to be \"re-expressed\", but proper amendments would be included in the financial statements for the first semester of 2017;423 (ii) international rating agencies, including S&P and Moody\u2019s, downgraded Banco Popular;424 (iii) Banco Popular announced that no dividends would be paid to shareholders and that it needed to pursue a capital increase, private sale, or merger;425 (iv) lower than expected quarterly results were published, showing a loss of \u20ac 137 million;426 and (v) news were released about the \"[u]rgent sale of [Banco] Popular due to bankruptcy risk\".427 This environment must be taken into account when assessing the various statements and non-statements of which the Claimants complain.\n\n**Exh.

Guindos maintained that the crisis at Banco Popular, which today has announced a new capital increase, **does not tarnish the health of the bank in the slightest. What I see in Banco Popular is that it is a solvent bank that has to take important decisions in the coming months,** said Guindos, who added that it is its shareholders who must decide if the entity should **be part of the consolidation process of the financial sector,** this is, the shareholders will have to determine if it requires any integration.\"428\n\n**Exh. C-74,** L. Pellicer, *Guindos ve al Popular \"solvente\" y dice que la banca espa\u00f1ola est\u00e1 \"saneada,* El Pa\u00eds, 10 April 2017, translated at **Exh. C-74 ENG** (emphasis added).\n\n554.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this statement is largely positive. On the one hand, Mr. de Guindos gave an optimistic indication about Banco Popular\u2019s solvency, going as far as saying that the \"crisis at Banco Popular\" \"does not tarnish the health of the bank in the slightest\". On the other hand, he described in neutral terms that the shareholders had to determine whether Banco Popular should be part of the consolidation process of the financial sector.\n\n(ii) 12 April 2017 statement by Ms. Irene Garrido\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n555.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, another Spanish newspaper, *La Vanguardia* reported the following statement by Ms. Irene Garrido, the Secretary of the Department of Economy and Support to the Companies of the Ministry of Economy:\n\n\"The Secretary of State for Economy and Business Support, Irene Garrido, said Wednesday that Banco Popular requires a **private solution** and has indicated that the Government follows **very closely** the alternatives proposed by the general meeting of shareholders Banco Popular to take forward the project of the new presidency of the entity.\n\nIn the press conference to analyze the CPI data for March, Garrido indicated that Banco Popular requires a **private solution,** since it is a **private entity** and the Government has received indications from the [ECB] and the Bank of Spain regarding that **it does not present solvency problems.**\n\nThe Government follows **very closely** the process of the new presidency of Banco Popular. **We follow the process of the new chairmanship of Banco Popular, with the formation of its team, and we closely follow the general meeting of shareholders in which they have proposed alternatives to take forward the project in which the new presidency trusts,** pointed Garrido in reference to the possible capital increase of the entity that would be carried out at the end of the year directed only to wholesalers and **without ruling out processes of merger of convergence, of consolidation.**\n\nAsked if the Executive discards a preventive recapitalization in line with what happened in Italy, Garrido has pointed out that the situations are **totally different** and has reaffirmed that it is **a problem of a private bank\".**\n\nGarrido says that Spain has **a completely healthy bank**\n\nThe 'number two' of Economy has stressed that at this time the entity is **trying to find a way to make effective that future project,** and stressed that in the Italian financial sector are doing **things** that has already made the Spanish Government, [s/c] **We have a completely healthy bank that is not affected by this type of events, a restructuring process has been carried out, I think it is unparalleled,** [s]he emphasized\".429\n\n**Exh. C-76 ENG,** *El Gobierno dice que el Banco Popular require una soluci\u00f3n privada,* La Vanguardia, 12 April 2017, translated at **Exh. C-76 ENG** (emphasis added).\n\n556.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, in her remarks, Ms. Garrido spoke in ways that could have both reassured and worried Banco Popular\u2019s depositors. While she sought to distinguish the Spanish situation from the one in the Italian financial sector, she did refer more than once to Banco Popular as a \"private bank\" requiring a \"private solution\", which may have conveyed the idea that the Spanish Government was reluctant to help Banco Popular. At the same time, she emphasized that the Government was \"following closely\" the events at Banco Popular, which does not give the impression that the bank was \"on its own\", as the Claimants maintain. On balance, the Tribunal finds that the statement was neutral and in any event not discriminatory, arbitrary or grossly unfair.\n\n(iii) 19 April 2017 statement by Mr. Luis de Guindos\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nOn 19 April 2017, still another Spanish press organ, *El Mundo* reported the following statement by Minister de Guindos:430\n\n\"Guindos: Banco Popular does not have neither solvency nor liquidity problems The Minister of Economy, Luis de Guindos, said Wednesday that Banco Popular has no problems of liquidity or solvency and has indicated that the entity **will be what its shareholders want it to be\".**\n\nAfter his participation in the XXIV Meeting of the Financial Sector, organized by ABC, Deloitte and Sociedad de Tasaci\u00f3n, the Minister of Economy stressed that when he asks the supervisor for the entity that presides Emilio Saracho, the answer he receives is that he [s/c] is a solvent bank **\"that does not have any liquidity problem.**\n\n**The Government and the Ministry of Economy do not have inspectors, the supervisor has them and it is the one that analyzes the situation of the entity, which is what they tell me: neither solvency nor liquidity problems,** insisted Guindos.\n\nThe minister has stressed that Popular is a private bank, so it is his [s/c] management team that has to make the right decisions. **[It] has already given directions in this regard and the Government has nothing to say,** he said. In this regard, he recalled that Popular has a part of its business focused on SMEs, a segment in which it is one of the entities with more presence. **Popular will be what its shareholders want it to be, the government will apply the competition rules,** he added.\n\nRegarding the possibility that the bank may participate in a corporate operation, de Guindos has avoided pronouncing and has stressed again that Popular is a private entity. **Whatever the managers decide, as long as it** **is within the regulations and the Law, the Government has nothing to say****,** [he] has settled.\n\nThe bank held last week its ordinary shareholders meeting in which its president, Emilio Saracho, said that Popular was doomed to expand capital again, without ruling out corporate operations, it [s/c] understands that the entity's independence is a value until it becomes in a load.\n\n**Exh. C-75,** El Mundo, *Guindos: Banco Popular no tiene \"problemas de solvencia ni de liquidez\",* 19 April 2017, translated at **Exh. C-75 ENG** (emphasis added).\n\n558.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Mr. de Guindos\u2019 statement of 12 April 2017 similar to the one made two days earlier by Ms. Garrido. While pointing to the \"private\" nature of the bank and the shareholders\u2019 and management roles, Mr. de Guindos made positive statements according to which Banco Popular was solvent. As such, this statement appears neutral and in any event not in breach of the minimum standard under international law.\n\n(iv) 18 May 2017 statement by Mr. Luis de Guindos\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nFinally, as reported by *El Economista,431* on 18 May 2017 Mr. de Guindos made the following statement:\n\n\"Guindos assures that no public money will be injected into Banco Popular The Minister of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, Luis de Guindos, affirmed today that the Government **did not foresee injecting any public capital** into Banco Popular.\n\nIn an act organized by the Association for the Progress of Management (APD), the minister stated this when asked about the situation of Banco Popular and the possibility of a corporate operation with another organization.\n\nDe Guindos indicated that it is not his place to speak about specific organizations, and added that neither the Government nor the Ministry of Economy have inspectors, and that Popular is being monitored by the [ECB], **\"When I\u2019ve asked the Bank of Spain, which is the 'connecting thread\u2019 with the single supervisor, what they say is that their capital level is above the minimum regulatory levels,\"** said the minister, who assured that this affirmation is **\"what [the Bank of Spain] tells me constantly.\"**\n\n**Exh. C-88,** El Economista, *Guindos asegura que no se va a inyectar dinero p\u00fablico en Banco Popular,* 18 May 2017, translated at **Exh. C-88 ENG** (emphasis added).\n\n560.\n\nThis statement was also reported by *Europa Press:432*\n\n\"The minister of Economic Affairs, Industry and Competitiveness, Luis de Guindos, asserted last Thursday that the Government **\"has no plans to inject public funds\"** into Banco Popular and highlighted that Banco de Espa\u00f1a **\"constantly\"** informs him that the entity exceeds the minimum regulatory capital levels.\n\nSuch was his statement during a lunch-colloquium on Spain\u2019s role in refounding the EU organised by the Association for Progress in Management (APD). He said that, **\"notwithstanding Community regulation, of course the Government is not planning to inject any public funds\".**De Guindos pointed out that Popular runs one traditional business line that is **\"very good\",** with a real estate exposure above the sector's average, a new management team and private shareholders.\n\n**\"Usually I never speak about any specific entity because it is not for me to do so,\"** said De Guindos to then add that the European Central Bank (ECB) data show that Spain has made a **\"huge\"** effort in cleaning up its financial system.\n\nHe further explained that neither the Government nor the Ministry of Economic Affairs have any inspectors, but rather that Banco Popular is supervised by the ECB, which is the only supervisor, and when he asks Banco de Espa\u00f1a -the **\"connecting thread\"** between the ECB and Spanish financial institutions- he is **\"****constantly**told that Popular\u2019s capital level is **\"above minimum regulatory levels\".**\n\nLikewise, he said that the ECB ran an asset quality review (AQR) and stress on Spanish banks, that went **\"very well, including Popular\".** In this regard, he emphasised that stress tests were conducted under \"dreadful\" scenarios to determine how much entities could endure with a capital level above minimum levels, and **\"the truth is that Popular passed the test \".**\n\nIn fact, he added that since then the economic scenario has been **\"quite different\",** shifting from recession to an average 3% growth, coupled with a recovery in real estate prices.\n\n**\"Popular runs one traditional business line that is very good, with a real estate exposure above the sector\u2019s average, a new management team and private shareholders and, notwithstanding Community regulation, of course the Government is not planning to inject any public funds,\"** he said.\n\n**Exh. R-15,** Europa Press, *Guindos states that the Government will not inject public funds into Banco Popular,* 18 May 2017 (emphasis added).\n\n561.\n\nIn this statement, Mr. de Guindos gave positive indications about Banco Popular, specifically that the bank\u2019s capital level was above the minimum regulatory levels; that the bank successfully passed the stress tests conducted under \"terrifying\" scenarios; and that the traditional activity of the bank was \"good\", and that it had a new management team. He also stated that the Government did not plan to inject public funds into the bank. This assertion can be understood in two ways: either it meant that the State would not provide needed assistance or it meant that a contribution of public funds was unnecessary, without implying that funds would not be available if required. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that indeed the first request for ELA was only made later, in June 2017. Again, on balance, Mr. de Guindos\u2019 statement cannot be deemed to be negative or to cause doubts about the availability of funds if required.\n\n562.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the statements by Spanish officials were \"unprecedented and alarming\",433 \"irresponsible\",434 or \"damning\",435 as the Claimants contend. While some may have been ambivalent, none of them rose to the level of an FET breach.\n\nSoC, para. 26(a).\n\nReply, para. 19.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 4.\n\n563.\n\nFinally, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 suggestion, none of the impugned statements can be equated to the type of statements that other tribunals have found in breach of investment treaty standards. Specifically, in *Vivendi* and *Azurix,* the Argentine provincial authorities had told citizens \"not to pay their water bills\" \"in all tones and in all the forms\", and made \"an explicit appeal about not paying for the water\".436 In *Crystallex,* Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that the Government would \"take back\" gold mines and would \"nationalize all of [the gold industry], recuperate and put an end to concessions, which led to degeneration\".437 Finally, in *Biwater,* the competent Minister had informed the public that the contract with the investor \"had been terminated\", which was found to be incorrect by the arbitral tribunal, and had stated that the Tanzanian governmental entity \"was taking over\".438\n\nSee **Exh.

The tribunal discussed these statements in the context of expropriation.. They are nonetheless referred to herebecause in this case the Claimants contend that \"[w]hile the *Crystallex* tribunal was analyzing Venezuela\u2019s conduct under an [expropriation] standard, the logic of its conclusion that government statements can harm investments is equally (if not more) applicable to the FET standard\". See Reply, n. 1039.\n\nSee **Exh. CL-17,** *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.

First, the Claimants complain that the \"Respondent never made a single public statement telling [Banco Popular\u2019s] depositors that there was no need to withdraw their deposits, that their deposits were safe and that there was no need for any depositor concern\".439 Second, they maintain that the Spanish authorities failed to correct declarations of the EU authorities and Bankia, a commercial bank who is majority owned by the Respondent.\n\nReply, para. 134.\n\n565.\n\nStarting with Spain\u2019s failure to make reassuring statements, the Tribunal is unpersuaded that, under the circumstances, Spain had an obligation to make statements aimed at convincing depositors to keep their funds with Banco Popular. As mentioned above, one cannot assume that mere silence amounts to a breach of the Treaty. This is particularly so in the case of Banco Popular, which as a \"significant\" financial institution was directly supervised by the ECB, not the Bank of Spain.440 As confirmed in Article 6.2.1 of the Memorandum of Understanding between the SRB and the ECB, these two bodies are in charge of coordinating external communication and, therefore, of approving what information can be published.441 In those conditions, the Tribunal sees no basis to hold that Spain should have been more proactive in its communication in support of Banco Popular.\n\n**Exh. C-008,** ECB, List of Supervised Entities, 3 April, 2017, pp. 3-4.\n\n**Exh. R-0413,** Memorandum of Understanding between the ECB and the SRB on cooperation and information Exchange, Article 6.2.1 (\"The Participants [i.e., the ECB and the SRB] strive to cooperate, if appropriate, in external communication with interest groups and the media on matters related to recovery and resolution within their respective responsibilities. The Communication Services of the SRB and the ECB will be responsible for coordinating external communication. Both Participants will provide a list of relevant units and responsible persons as well as general contact points responsible for external communication\").\n\n566.\n\nStill in respect of the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to make positive statements, the Claimants argue that such conduct is in contrast with Spain\u2019s stance vis-\u00e0-vis Catalan banks. They point in particular at Mr. de Guindos\u2019 statement of 5 October 2017 to show that Banco Popular was treated differently from the banks in Catalonia:\n\n\"The Spanish market is suffering from Catalans\u2019 independence attempt [...] the government has already made it (indirectly) clear that they have the backing of the [ECB] and that \"there is nothing to fear. Luis de Guindos, stated that: \"The Catan banks are Spanish banks and European banks, they are solid entities and customers have nothing to fear. He also referred to the evolution of the Catalan economy, describing it as positive, given that No one has believed this independentist threat.\"442\n\n**Exh. C-192 ,** S. Bustamante, *Por el efecto Catalu\u00f1a, bancos ya sufren retiro de dep\u00f3sitos,* Cronista, 5 October 2017, translated at **Exh. C-192 ENG.**\n\n567.\n\nAs is evident from the quotation, Mr. de Guindos statement is directly linked to the political crisis concerning Catalu\u00f1a. It is obvious that the primary concern expressed in this statement is that Catalu\u00f1a\u2019s claims for independence could adversely affect banks established in this region of Spain. Catalu\u00f1a\u2019s claims for sovereignty prompted the Spanish Minister to re-assure the markets that Catalan banks would continue to be Spanish and European banks and, accordingly, depositors had \"nothing to fear\". Banco Popular and the Catalan banks were not in a comparable situation for these purposes. Hence, Mr. de Guindos\u2019 failure to issue a similar statement regarding Banco Popular is in no way discriminatory to Banco Popular or its shareholders.\n\n568.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants contend that Spain was under a duty to \"correct\" the following statements made by other actors:\n\n\u2022 On 23 May 2017, the Chairman of the SRB, Dr. Elke K\u00f6nig, confirmed in an interview that Banco Popular was one of the banks that \"we are watching\";443\n\n\u2022 On 31 May 2017, Reuters, relying on unnamed European officials, reported that \"[o]ne of Europe\u2019s top bank watchdogs has warned European Union officials that Spain\u2019s Banco Popular [...] may need to be wound down if it fails to find a buyer\" and reported that \"Elke K\u00f6nig, who chairs an EU body that winds down troubled banks, recently issued an 'early warning\u2019 [in relation to Banco Popular]\";444\n\n\u2022 On 2 June 2017, Bankia, a commercial bank in which Spain holds a majority interest, refused to participate in the auction for Banco Popular, which led the media to report that Santander was the only bidder. The press report to which the Claimants refer reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Santander is left alone in bidding for Popular: Bankia doesn\u2019t want any surprises 2/06/2017 - 14:26 Updated 18:20 - 2/06/2017\n\nSantander is the only left in the pending sales process for Banco Popular opened by President Emilio Saracho. Although the operation originally aroused the curiosity of big organizations, only the Cantabrian group and Bankia presented last 16th a proposal [...].445\n\nSoC, para. 176, referring to **Exh. C-93,** Bloomberg, *Single Resolution Board Says EU Should not Be Bailing Out Banks* (Video), 23 May 2017, 5:17-5:20.\n\n**Exh. C-101,** F.

C-103,** elEconomista.es, *Santander se queda solo en la puja por el Popular; Bankia no quiere sorpresas,* 2 June 2017, translated **at Exh. C-103 ENG.**\n\n569.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants that Spain had an obligation to \"correct\" or rectify any of these statements, let alone that failure to do so breached FET. It is true that the statements attributed to the EU officials, including Dr. K\u00f6nig, and to Bankia were somewhat ambivalent. In saying that the ECB \"was watching\" Banco Popular, Dr Konig could have referred to the ECB\u2019s supervision over Banco Popular. At the same time, she could have meant that the situation deserved to be watched because it was worrisome and any worries could have increased by the reference to an \"early warning\".\n\n570.\n\nSimilarly, while the press report indicating that Bankia had withdrawn from the sale process was truthful, the newspaper\u2019s commenting that Bankia \"doesn\u2019t want any surprises\" could be understood as implying that Banco Popular\u2019s financial condition was hiding bad surprises. Overall, despite this ambivalence, the Tribunal does not find that Spain\u2019s failure to issue corrective statements rose to a breach of the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n571.\n\nIn summary, Spain did not breach Article IV through the statements or non-statements of its public officials.\n\n**c.** ***Failure to enact short sales ban***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**i.** ***The Claimants\u2019 position***\n------------------------------------\n\n572.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain\u2019s failure to impose a short sales ban on Banco Popular\u2019s shares was in breach of the FET standard.446 They contend that the use of this regulatory tool was warranted and could have improved Banco Popular\u2019s liquidity situation. In the Claimants\u2019 submission, that failure was arbitrary, in particular because its alleged process for evaluating the short-sale ban was unsupported by any documentary evidence.447 It was also discriminatory, because Spain treated Banco Popular differently from Liberbank, in respect of which it had enacted a short sales ban in similar circumstances.448\n\nSee SoC, paras. 339-378; Reply, paras. 614-628; C-PHB1, paras. 83-93; C-PHB2, paras. 42-54.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 83 (emphasis added).

Banning short sales is appropriate when a share price experiences a significant and anomalous fall over a single day. As to Banco Popular\u2019s share price, it had been constantly declining since 2007. According to Spain, the National Securities Market Commission *(Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Mercado de Valores* or \"CNMV\") monitored the short positions in Banco Popular in 2016-2017 and considered that the ban was inappropriate.450\n\nSoD, paras. 323-341; Rejoinder, paras. 1145-1160; R-PHB1, paras. 121-131; R-PHB2, para. 65-73.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 123-124, referring to RWS-5, paras. 4-19, 20-35.\n\n574.\n\nSecond, short-selling was not the reason for Banco Popular\u2019s declining share price or liquidity crisis,451 which is one of the differences between Liberbank and Banco Popular.452 Consequently, imposing a short sales ban would not have prevented Banco Popular\u2019s liquidity crisis. On the contrary, it could have signaled that the bank was facing a crisis instead of restoring confidence.453\n\nRejoinder, para. 1154; R-PHB1, paras. 121-131; R-PHB2, paras. 65-73.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 129, referring to Netvalue, Presentation, \"The role of the CNMV in relation to the short positions of Banco Popular in the first half of 2017\", 26 May 2021, p. 36.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1154, 1159.\n\n575.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent notes that neither the Claimants nor Banco Popular ever requested the CNMV to adopt a short sales ban.454\n\nR-PHB1, para. 124.\n\n**iii.** ***Discussion***\n-------------------------\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain breached FET by failing to ban short sales of Banco Popular shares. As explained by the Claimants\u2019 expert Prof. Goldstein, short sellers \"attempt to profit by borrowing stock, selling it at a relatively high price and then covering their position once the price has deteriorated later on\".455 The Claimants maintain that the \"Respondent did nothing to respond to the short sales, despite its inherent power to ban such predatory conduct without any cost to taxpayers\".456 In particular, they submit that the \"Respondent acted arbitrarily in its alleged process for evaluating the short sale ban, unsupported by not even a shred of documentary evidence\"457 and in a discriminatory manner by treating a comparable bank, namely Liberbank, differently under similar circumstances.458\n\nCER-3, para. 33\n\nSoC, para. 126.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 83 (emphasis added). See also SoC, para. 355, 361; C-PHB2, para. 54.\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB1, para. 85.\n\n577.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that it had the power to ban short sales.459 It asserts, however, that under the applicable framework the conditions for such an \"exceptional measure\" were not met and that there was nothing arbitrary or discriminatory in its decision not to ban short sales of Banco Popular shares.\n\nSee, e.g., SoD, para. 325.\n\n578.\n\nThe Parties and their experts agree on the legal framework that applies to the enactment of short sales bans and which primarily rests on Regulation (EU) No. 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 on short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps (\"Regulation No. 236/2012\").460 Regulation No. 236/2012 lays down \"a common regulatory framework with regard to the requirements and powers relating to short selling\" and seeks \"to ensure greater coordination and consistency between Member States where measures have to be taken in exceptional circumstances\".461\n\n**Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012.\n\n**Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012, Recital (2).\n\n579.\n\nRecital (5) of Regulation No. 236/2012 explains that \"[t]he requirements to be imposed should address the identified risks without unduly detracting from the benefits that short selling provides to the quality and efficiency of markets\" and adds that \"[w]hile in certain situations it could have adverse effects, under normal market conditions, short selling plays an important role in ensuring the proper functioning of financial markets, in particular in the context of market liquidity and efficient price formation\".462 Recital (36) further specifies that \"[p]owers of intervention of competent authorities and ESMA [the European Securities and Markets Authority] to restrict short selling, credit default swaps and other transactions should be only of a temporary nature and should be exercised only for such a period and to the extent necessary to deal with the specific threat\".463\n\n**Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012, Recital (5).\n\n**Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012, Recital (36).\n\n580.\n\nRegulation No. 236/2012 envisages two situations in which the competent national authorities may impose short sales restrictions, which are addressed in Articles 20 and 23. Article 20 of Regulation No. 236/2012 provides that the authorities may enact restrictions on short selling \"in exceptional circumstances\":\n\n\"Article 20\n\n**Restrictions on short selling and similar transactions in exceptional circumstances**\n\n1. Subject to Article 22, a competent authority may take one or more of the measures referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article where:\n\n(a) there are adverse events or developments which constitute a serious threat to financial stability or to market confidence in the Member State concerned or in one or more other Member States; and\n\n(b) the measure is necessary to address the threat and will not have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of financial markets which is disproportionate to its benefits.\"\n\n[...]\n\n581.\n\nThe provision\u2019s title makes it clear that short selling restrictions are limited to \"[...] exceptional circumstances\", where \"adverse events or developments constitute a serious threat to financial stability or to market confidence\".464 In the presence of exceptional circumstances, the competent authorities must assess whether the measure is necessary to address the threat and will not have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of financial markets which is disproportionate to its benefits\".465\n\nExamples are provided in the supplementing regulations, notably Article 24 of Commission Delegated Regulation No. 918/2012, supplementing Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 with regard to definitions, the calculation of net short positions, covered sovereign credit default swaps, notification thresholds, liquidity thresholds for suspending restrictions, significant falls in the value of financial instruments and adverse events, **Exh. RL-0286.**\n\n**Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012, Article 23(1)(b). See also Recital 27 (\"In taking such measures [including restrictions on short selling], competent authorities should pay due regard to the principle of proportionality\").\n\n582.\n\nThe second situation in which competent authorities may adopt short selling restrictions is described in Article 23 of Regulation No. 236/2012 as one involving a \"significant fall in prices\" of a financial instrument, which is defined as \"10% or more\" for liquid shares (such as those of Banco Popular). In that case, the competent authority \"shall consider whether it is appropriate\" to restrict short selling:\n\n\"1. Where the price of a financial instrument on a trading venue has fallen significantly during a single trading day in relation to the closing price on that venue on the previous trading day, the competent authority of the home Member State for that venue shall consider whether it is appropriate to prohibit or restrict natural or legal persons from engaging in short selling of the financial instrument on that trading venue or otherwise limit transactions in that financial instrument on that trading venue in order to prevent a disorderly decline in the price of the financial instrument.\n\n[...]\n\n5. The fall in value shall be 10 % or more in the case of a liquid share, as defined in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 [...].\"\n\n583.\n\nPursuant to Articles 20 and 23 of Regulation No. 236/2012, a short sale ban may only be imposed in exceptional circumstances, as opposed to the ordinary course of action.466 In other words, the threshold to trigger restrictions to short selling appears high, which is clear from the reference to \"a serious threat to financial stability or to market confidence\" and a \"significant fall in price\". When exceptional circumstances exist, Regulation No. 236/2012 affords a wide margin of discretion to the competent authority, here the CNMV. In exercising their discretion, national authorities must either undertake a proportionality analysis in the presence of a serious threat to financial stability or market confidence (Article 20(1)(a)) or consider the appropriateness of a restriction or ban on short sales, if the share price drops significantly (Article 23(1)). The competent national authority is thus tasked with weighing the pros and cons linked to restricting short selling in a given situation, balancing the potential benefits of short selling467 with their possible \"adverse effects\". The discretion entrusted in the national authorities under Regulation No. 236/2012 is not disputed by the Claimants\u2019 expert Dr. de la Mano, who acknowledges that \"[i]t is evident that the SSR [Regulation No. 236/2012] grants certain discretion to the NCA [national competent authority] to determine what constitute exceptional circumstances\".468\n\nSee also, in addition, in addition to the provisions discussed in the text, Article 27(2) of **Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012, which states that \"After receiving notification under Article 26 of any measure that is to be imposed or renewed under Article [...] 20 [...], ESMA [the European Securities and Markets Authority] shall within 24 hours issue an opinion on whether it considers the measure or proposed measure is *necessary to address the exceptional circumstances* (emphasis added).\n\n**Exh. RL-0285,** Regulation No. 236/2012, Recital (5).\n\nCER-5, para. 9.11.\n\n584.\n\nAs it already noted,469 the Tribunal owes deference to the national authority and should not second-guess the correctness of its decision. The Tribunal\u2019s scope of review is limited to verifying whether the impugned conduct was arbitrary or discriminatory, which are in fact also the two grounds raised by the Claimants in this connection.470 In this context, a failure to enact a ban would be arbitrary if the supervisor\u2019s decision was based on an excess or abuse of discretion, on prejudice or personal preference, or if it was taken for reasons other than those put forward by the decision maker.471 That failure would be discriminatory, if there were no reasonable or justifiable grounds to adopt a different treatment in like circumstances.472\n\nSee supra paras. 520-523.\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB2, para. 42 (\"Respondent\u2019s conduct [in connection with the failure to enact a short sales ban] was arbitrary and discriminatory, in breach of the Treaty\u2019s FET [...]\").\n\nSee **Exh. CL-291,** *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, para. 578; **Exh. RLA-0007,** *EDF (Services) Limited v.

The Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 200, para. 184.\n\n585.\n\nThe evidence in the record, including the expert evidence, contains no indication that Spain\u2019s decision not to enact a short sales ban of Banco Popular shares was arbitrary. On the one hand, the Claimants and their experts have shown that Banco Popular\u2019s short positions reached 12% of its capital, which was the largest reported short-sale position in Spain,473 and that Banco Popular\u2019s stock experienced a significant price drop a number of times.474 On the other hand, the Respondent has convincingly explained that the selling pressure came mainly from investors with long positions who sold these positions, and not from investors with short positions, which means that a ban on short selling would not have resolved the bank\u2019s crisis. It is also reasonable to expect a ban on short-selling to send a \"stigmatizing\" signal about the financial condition of Banco Popular, which would have aggravated, rather than alleviated, the market\u2019s distrust in the bank. Moreover, Banco Popular\u2019s shares only once fell more than 10%, on 1 June 2017, following a constant decline over the years.\n\n**CER-2-053,** Net Short Positions data from the CNMV.\n\nCER-1, Figure 3; **Exh. R-304,** Banco Popular, variation of short positions in May-June 2017, June 2017.\n\n586.\n\nIn support of its explanations, the Respondent has offered the evidence of Mr. Rodrigo Buenaventura, CNMV\u2019s current Chairman and then Director General for Markets. In his written statements, Mr. Buenaventura testified that the CNMV considered and discarded a short sales ban and explained the reasons for the decision.475 While at the hearing Mr. Buenaventura admitted that there was no paper trail of the \"verbal discussions\" leading to the CNMV\u2019s decision against a short-sale ban,476 the Tribunal has no reason to doubt his testimony that such exercise did in fact take place. It also notes that the Claimants have not shown that the CNMV was under an obligation to keep a record or to give reasons for its decision.477 This is especially so where the Claimants made no request for the imposition of a short sales ban. Taking into account all these facts, including in particular the reasons for Spain\u2019s decision not to impose a short sales ban, the Tribunal can only conclude that Spain did not misuse its discretion under the applicable regulations nor did it act arbitrarily otherwise.\n\nRWS-5, para. 34; RWS-11, paras. 31-35.\n\nMay Hearing Tr. [English version], 21 May 2021, 819:21-23, 821:6, 15-16.\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB1, para. 83 (Per the standard announced by *the Saluka v. Czech Republic* tribunal, the State\u2019s decision not to help the claimant\u2019s bank [through a short sales ban], as it did with other banks, had to be reasonably justifiable by public policies. That requirement includes an obligation to provide reasons for a particular course of action\", internal footnotes omitted), para. 91 (\"Respondent\u2019s failure to provide contemporaneous evidence of its decision not to impose a short-sale ban further confirms its FET breach. As the tribunal in *Teco v. Guatemala* observed, the minimum standard includes an obligation to provide reasons for a particular course of action\", internal footnote omitted). According to Mr. Buenaventura, supportive documentation \"should exist in the event of adopting a measure that the SSR clearly classifies as exceptional [...]. Not vice-versa [...]\". See RWS-11, para. 34.\n\n587.\n\nAs was just observed, Banco Popular itself never requested a ban on short selling. The Claimants have not convincingly explained why they made no request, except to say that Banco Popular \"was neither required nor expected to request a short-sale ban under the applicable regulation\". They also underlined that Regulation No. 236/2012 \"imposes detailed reporting requirements on short-sellers so that the competent authorities such as the CNMV are in a position to monitor short-sales and intervene as necessary\".478 While it is true that a request from Banco Popular was not a pre-requisite for the CNMV to enact a ban, the fact that Banco Popular did not request one suggests that even Banco Popular did not regard a ban to be necessary.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 47.\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the claim of discriminatory treatment of Banco Popular vis-\u00e0-vis Liberbank. It is undisputed that, contrary to Banco Popular, [REDACTED].479 Furthermore, the Respondent has sufficiently justified its decision in favor of a short sale ban of Liberbank\u2019s shares.480 These justifications are found in Mr. Buenaventura\u2019s testimony, Netvalue\u2019s expert report, and ESMA (\"European Securities and Markets Authority\")\u2019s opinion of 12 June 2017, whereby the European supervisory authority reviewed whether the measure proposed by CNMV in respect of Liberbank was \"necessary to address the exceptional circumstances\" envisaged in the regulation.481 This opinion offers detailed reasons for the decision to ban short selling of Liberbank shares. It also gives indications distinguishing the situations of the two banks.\n\n**Exh.

On the one hand, Banco Popular\u2019s share price had constantly been declining years before its resolution and the bank was suffering from an impaired financial situation and serious liquidity problems. By contrast, Liberbank\u2019s financial situation was overall positive without liquidity issues. Its share price had remained stable since 2015, and enjoyed an upward trend since June 2016.482 However, as noted in EMSA\u2019s opinion, in the trading sessions of 7, 8 and 9 of June 2017, Liberbank\u2019s share price abruptly \"fell respectively 7,68%, 18,02% and 17,57%, with noticeable increases in the traded volumes\" and there was \"no underlying inside information from Liberbank that could justify this downward trend\".483 As Mr. Buenaventura also set out, \"[a]s opposed to Banco Popular, there were no profit warnings, impairment announcements, changes or discrepancies in the management team or any other circumstance that could explain the abrupt price movement\".484\n\nRER-8, paras. 137-138, 142-143.\n\n**Exh.

While they acknowledge that the grant of ELA is discretionary, they maintain that Spain abused its discretion.485\n\nSoC, paras. 339-378; Reply, paras. 629-667; C-PHB1, paras. 100-147; C-PHB2, paras. 30-41.\n\n593.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Spain\u2019s decision to suspend ELA was unjustified and unreasonable. Through various communications, the Bank of Spain made Banco Popular believe that ELA of \u20ac 9.5 billion was forthcoming, yet eventually refused to provide it. In particular, on 5 June 2017, the Bank of Spain informed the ECB that Banco Popular had pledged sufficient collateral to cover \u20ac 9.5 billion of ELA.486 The next day, the Bank of Spain confirmed that the pledged collateral would cover \u20ac 10.034 billion of ELA.487 Notwithstanding these statements, by 6 June 2017, the Bank of Spain provided only \u20ac 3.8 billion and suspended the remaining ELA without any explanation. For the Claimants, had Spain granted ELA as promised, Banco Popular would have been saved.488\n\n**Exh.

See also C-PHB2, para. 40.\n\n594.\n\nThe Claimants highlight that even the Bank of Spain\u2019s employees did not understand why the ELA process was stayed. For instance, [REDACTED], who were responsible for reviewing Banco Popular\u2019s collateral at the Bank of Spain, confirmed that they were ready to continue working on Banco Popular\u2019s request after 7 June 2017.489 In the absence of any contemporaneous evidence showing the reasons for the ELA suspension, Spain\u2019s *post hoc* rationalizations, specifically those contained in expert reports of Versant, lack credibility.490\n\nC-PHB1 paras. 122-126.\n\nReply, para. 632; C-PHB1 para. 101.\n\n595.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 submission that Banco Popular was eligible to receive the requested ELA, as it satisfied the applicable requirements. Although some documentation related to Banco Popular\u2019s collateral may not have been entirely in order,491 this does not justify the complete suspension of the ELA, as any irregularities could have been fixed. In any event, there is no evidence that Banco Popular could not have pledged additional collateral.492\n\nC-PHB1 paras. 131, 139-140, referring to **Exh.

Specifically, the Bank of Spain failed to communicate to Banco Popular what collateral should be presented and how far in advance. In the Claimants\u2019 submission, such information should have been communicated in May, rather than in June 2017 when the bank was suffering from severe liquidity shortage.493\n\nReply, para. 654; C-PHB1, paras. 105-106.\n\n**ii.** ***The Respondent\u2019s position***\n---------------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nAs a preliminary issue, Spain notes that the ELA contract contains an exclusive choice of the courts of Madrid. Thus, the Claimants cannot challenge the ELA procedure in this arbitration.494 In any event, Spain\u2019s conduct in connection with the ELA complied with FET.495\n\nRejoinder, para. 1164, referring to **Exh.

Banco Popular was not entitled to receive ELA in the amount of \u20ac 9.5 billion, and Spain was under no obligation to grant it.496\n\nRejoinder, paras. 27, 1170.\n\n599.\n\nSecond, Spain denies suspending the ELA and notes that (i) ELA may only be suspended upon the decision of the Executive Commission, which was not obtained here;497 (ii) the Bank of Spain continued to value potential collateral throughout the evening of 6 June 2017;498 and (iii) it was Banco Popular that requested the termination of the ELA contract.499\n\nR-PHB1, para. 159.

In May 2017, the Bank of Spain authorized ELA up to \u20ac 1.8 billion (subsequently increased to \u20ac 2.8 billion) to be granted if Banco Popular requested it, on the condition that (i) Banco Popular was solvent and (ii) provided sufficient collateral.\n\nb. Between March and early June 2017, the Bank of Spain and Banco Popular conducted several dry-run exercises and two ELA simulations. The Bank of Spain valued the potential collateral that Banco Popular could offer on a preliminary basis. However, the Claimants waited until 3 June 2017 to present new categories of assets that it had never presented before during the earlier simulations.\n\nc. The Bank of Spain continued to value the assets that Banco Popular had identified as potential collateral until the bank informed that it was *failing or likely to fail* (\"FOLTF\").\n\nSoD, paras. 859-863. See also Rejoinder, paras. 383-384, referring to RER-1, para. 183(b); RER-4, para. 60.\n\n601.\n\nFourth, the refusal to grant ELA in the total amount of \u20ac 9.5 billion was justified by the lack of sufficient collateral required under the ELA contract.501 After the appropriate haircuts, the collateral provided was only worth \u20ac 3.8 billion and by 6 June 2017 ELA in that amount had been granted.502 The Bank of Spain could not grant ELA without sufficient collateral because it would have compromised its financial independence.503\n\nSoD, para. 873; Rejoinder, para. 1199; R-PHB1, paras. 163-168; R-PHB2, paras. 90-101.\n\nSoD, para. 873; R-PHB2, para. 81.\n\nSoD, paras. 863-864.\n\n602.\n\nFifth, Spain disputes having ever confirmed that Banco Popular pledged sufficient collateral for\u20ac 9.5 billion in ELA. In connection with the e-mails of the Bank of Spain of early June 2017, the Respondent clarifies that they attached preliminary valuations of the assets which Banco Popular has identified as collateral. [REDACTED], who was the author of the emails, confirmed this fact.504 In relation to the ECB\u2019s Non-Objection (\"ECB\u2019s Non-Objection\"),505 the ECB authorized a \"ceiling\", meaning that the Bank of Spain could disburse less than the maximum authorized amount. Although the email sent by the Bank of Spain to the ECB on that occasion indicated that \"[a]ppropriate collateral for the purpose of ELA has been provided by the bank\", [REDACTED]506 such indication had no bearing on whether the bank could pledge any of these assets as collateral.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 147-151, 154, referring to **Exh.

Specifically, they argue that the \"Respondent failed to act in a consistent and professional manner\" when it first \"confirm[ed] that Banco Popular met the requirements to obtain the liquidity assistance that it requested (including confirmation that Banco Popular was solvent and presented sufficient collateral)\" and then \"rescinded its approval to provide ELA\",508 thereby \"reneging on [Banco Popular\u2019s] legitimate expectation of ELA\".509 The Claimants also submit that the \"Respondent abuse[d] the discretionary element of ELA decision-making to justify its complete lack of transparency\",510 acted with \"evident negligence\",511 and breached \"the most basic obligations imposed by the Treaty - those of transparency, of non-arbitrary decision-making, of non-discrimination, and of a stable and predictable investment environment\".512\n\nSoC, para. 370.\n\nReply, para. 636.\n\nReply, para. 630.\n\nReply, para. 666 (Respondent\u2019s abrupt decision to retract the ELA that [Banco Popular] needed to continue operating constituted evident negligence, as it fell below what would be expected of a reasonable regulator\").\n\nReply, para. 633. See also ibid., para. 664 (where the Claimants argue that Spain \"failed to provide any reasons justifying its denial of ELA, and as such cannot prove that its decision was made in an objective and rational way).\n\n605.\n\nFor its part, Spain maintains that its conduct in connection with Banco Popular\u2019s ELA request was at all times consistent with its domestic, EU, and international law obligations.513\n\nSee SoD, paras. 858-879; Rejoinder, paras. 1161-1211; R-PHB1, paras. 132-178; R-PHB2, paras. 78-108.\n\n606.\n\nBefore assessing whether Spain breached the Treaty by failing to provide the requested ELA, the Tribunal will briefly deal with Spain\u2019s inadmissibility objection. In one single paragraph in the Rejoinder, Spain \"notes that in the ELA contracts, Banco Popular and the Bank of Spain had agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 'courts and tribunals of the city of Madrid\u2019 to resolve any dispute arising out of the ELA contracts, and had 'expressly waived any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them, for any actions and claims that may arise out of [the ELA contracts]\u2019. Accordingly, Claimants cannot bring before this Tribunal any action or claim that may arise out of the ELA contracts and, consequently, such actions or claims are inadmissible.\"514. The Tribunal is of the view that this objection should have been raised in Spain\u2019s Statement of Defense, rather than in the Rejoinder, and is therefore belated. Even if it were not belated, Spain has not sufficiently substantiated this objection. In any event, the Tribunal is not adjudicating the disputes arising out of the ELA contract,515 but is assessing whether Spain\u2019s conduct in connection with ELA is in breach of the Treaty. In that context, it may have to consider the ELA contract, but doing so, it does not exercise jurisdiction under the ELA contract. It merely reviews Spain\u2019s conduct in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the BIT. Therefore, the dispute resolution clause contained in that contract does not render the Treaty claims inadmissible.\n\nSee Rejoinder, para. 1164 (internal footnote omitted).\n\n**Exh. R-0251,** Bank of Spain, Emergency Liquidity Provision Agreement, 5 June 2017.\n\n607.\n\nMoving now to the claim, the Tribunal finds it helpful first to review the framework that governs ELA. Emergency liquidity assistance or \"ELA\" is, as its name indicates, emergency lending provided by the national central banks of the Eurosystem to solvent banks that face temporary illiquidity problems and are unable to obtain liquidity on the interbank market or via monetary policy operations administered by the ECB.516\n\nSee **Exh. R-0231,** ELA Agreement, 17 May 2017 para. 1.2.\n\n608.\n\nThe main responsibility for the provision of ELA \"lies at the national level, with the NCBs [national central banks] concerned\",517 in this case the Bank of Spain. It is not seriously disputed that the grant of ELA by national central banks is discretionary.518 As noted by the ECB, it is within \"the competence of central banks to decide independently and *at their full discretion* on the provision of central bank liquidity to solvent credit institutions, both in standard monetary policy operations as well as [ELA], within the limits imposed by the monetary financing prohibition under the Treaty\".519 Therefore, a bank cannot assume that ELA will be available to it.520\n\n**Exh. R-0231,** ELA Agreement, 17 May 2017, para. 2.1.\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB2, para. 31 (where the Claimants explain that they \"do not contest that ELA is discretionary\", although they contend that it is \"constrained by Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Treaty\"); May Hearing Tr. [English version], 22 May 2021 , 859:6-9 (de la Mano) (\"the Banco de Espa\u00f1a has discretion to grant or deny ELA, but this discretion should not be exercised arbitrarily\"); 902:19-20 (\"Emergency Liquidity Assistance is discretionary\").\n\n**Exh. R-0233,** Opinion of the ECB CON/2012/99, para. 3.2 (emphasis added).\n\nSee, e.g., **Exh. R-0234,** ECB Monthly Bulletin, The EU Arrangements for Financial Crisis Management, February 2007, p. 80 (\"A credit institution cannot, however, assume automatic access to central bank liquidity. As a central banking function, the provision of ELA is within the discretion of the national central bank).\n\n609.\n\nIt is undisputed that ELA can only be granted to solvent financial institutions521 and must be secured by \"sufficient\" collateral.522 The National Central Bank (\"NCB\") has discretion in designing the applicable collateral framework, which should however always ensure that \"sufficient\u2019 collateral\" is pledged.523 As can be inferred from the ELA agreement, the document issued by the ECB that sets out the rules and procedures related to ELA, collateral is deemed \"sufficient\" for ELA if the asset is both eligible for ELA and its post-haircut value is greater than or equal to the amount of ELA disbursed, including interest.524\n\nSee **Exh. R-0231,** ELA Agreement, 17 May 2017, paras. 4 (entitled \"ELA solvency criterion for credit institutions\") and 5.4 (which sets forth that \"ELA provision to insolvent institutions and institutions for which insolvency proceedings have been initiated according to national laws violates the prohibition of monetary financing\"); Claimant\u2019s Opening See May Hearing Tr. [English version], 17 May 2021, 29:24-25, 30:1-7 (\"[t]he process for applying [for] and receiving ELA also is undisputed. ELA can only be granted to institutions that are solvent. The borrower bank also must request the ELA. If requested, the ELA must be secured against sufficient collateral. And if sufficient collateral is provided, ELA may be granted up to the amount of the eligible collateral provided net of haircuts, and those haircuts are designed to take into account the risks associated with specific collateral assets\").\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Opening May Hearing Tr. [English version], 17 May 2021, 29:24-25, 30:1-3 ([t]he process for applying [for] and receiving ELA also is undisputed. ELA can only be granted to institutions that are solvent. The borrower bank also must request the ELA. If requested, the ELA *must be secured against sufficient collateral,* emphasis added).\n\nSee, for instance, **Exh. R-0232,** ECB, The financial risk management of the Eurosystem\u2019s monetary policy operations, July 2015, p. 35 (\"NCBs can in principle autonomously design their own collateral framework for ELA, including the applicable risk control measures. Such a framework should, however, ensure that sufficient collateral is provided, according to the NCB\u2019s own risk assessment, to cover the risks arising from such operations to such an extent that the financial independence of the NCB is ensured\").\n\n**Exh, R-0231,** ELA Agreement, 17 May 2017, para. 3.2(a)(i) (\"NCBs should always inform the ECB of the details of any ELA operation, at the latest, within two business days after the operation was carried out. The information needs to include, at least, the following elements: [...] (5) the collateral/guarantees against which the ELA is (intended to be) provided, including the valuation of, and any haircuts applied to, the collateral provided and, where applicable, details on the guarantee provided and terms of any contractual safeguards; (6) the interest rate to be paid by the institution receiving ELA that is (intended to be) provided; [...]\").\n\n610.\n\nIn terms of procedure, the assessment of assets offered as collateral is a cooperative process between the bank seeking ELA and the NCB. The bank must give the NCB detailed information on the potential collateral to allow the NCB to determine the eligibility of the assets as collateral and the collateral\u2019s effective value in ELA operations by applying the relevant haircuts. A \"haircut\" is the amount by which the effective value of the asset used as collateral is reduced to reflect the credit rating and other risk factors that may impact its value. Following this assessment, the bank must satisfy the legal requirements to pledge the assets.\n\n611.\n\nUnder the 2017 version of the ELA agreement applicable at the relevant time, a NCB must report its decision to provide ELA, along with information relating to the applicable terms and conditions, to the ECB within two days after the operation is carried out, where it involves up to \u20ac 500 million in ELA, and in advance of the operation or limit, where it involves a higher amount.525 The ECB may veto ELA if it determines, by a two-third majority of the Governing Council, that the provision of ELA would interfere with the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem, including the single monetary policy and the prohibition against monetary financing.526 If the ELA amount exceeds \u20ac 2 billion, the NCB must seek the ECB Governing Council\u2019s Non-Objection to the ELA operation.527\n\n**Exh.

First, as a result of the discretion which the Bank of Spain enjoyed in granting or refusing ELA, a financial institution cannot expect that it will necessarily receive ELA, nor does it have an entitlement to ELA. Second, the Tribunal cannot second-guess the appropriateness of granting or refusing ELA in the specific circumstances, which is a decision inherently reserved to the NCBs. Rather, its task is to review whether the State\u2019s conduct in connection with an ELA request was arbitrary, grossly lacking in transparency or otherwise in breach of the minimum standard of treatment.529\n\nSee supra paras. 517-519.\n\n615.\n\nWith these observations in mind, the Tribunal reviews the process followed by Spain in connection with Banco Popular\u2019s ELA requests.\n\n616.\n\nIn late March 2017, Banco Popular and the Bank of Spain began to discuss the possibility of Banco Popular requesting ELA.530 The Respondent\u2019s witnesses have explained (without being contradicted on this point by the Claimants\u2019 witnesses) that on 31 March 2017, the Bank of Spain proposed to commence so-called \"dry run\" exercises with Banco Popular, pursuant to which Banco Popular would identify assets to be used as potential collateral and send information regarding such assets to the Bank of Spain.531 The dry runs lasted until early June 2017.532\n\nRWS-3, paras. 8-12, discussing a telephone conference between Bank of Spain and Banco Popular.

They contend that \"[t]he dispute over ELA ultimately centers on why, on 6 June 2017, Respondent suddenly refused to provide the ELA that [Banco Popular] requested\u2014 ELA that [Banco Popular] was led to believe it would receive through the [Bank of Spain\u2019s] numerous pre-approvals\".563 In essence, the Claimants argue that the Bank of Spain \"confirmed that [Banco Popular] met all the requirements to receive up to \u20ac 9.5 billion in ELA\"564 and, notwithstanding this confirmation, \"abruptly\" suspended the ELA.565\n\nReply, para. 148. See also ibid., para. 13 (\"[Banco Popular] and its investors [...] were led to believe that the [Bank of Spain] would be there, as Spain\u2019s lender of last resort, if and when the time came\"); para. 635 (\"Through these repeated interactions, Respondent led [Banco Popular] to believe that liquidity assistance would be forthcoming, as and when requested. This was an entirely reasonable and legitimate expectation\").\n\nC-PHB1, section II.D.2.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 102, 144.\n\n632.\n\nIt is common ground566 that the Bank of Spain\u2019s approval and grant of ELA was subject to the following conditions: (1) the presentation by Banco Popular of a formal request for an ELA disbursement; (2) the ECB\u2019s confirmation of Banco Popular\u2019s solvency for the purposes of the ELA provision; (3) the provision of adequate collateral in accordance with the report to be drawn up by the Directorate-General for Operations, Markets and Payment Systems describing the collateral, assessing its adequacy and establishing the appropriate haircuts to determine the actual value of the asset when pledged as collateral; and (4) the ECB\u2019s Non-Objection.567\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB1, para. 109; Rejoinder, para. 423.\n\nSee, e.g., **Exh. R-0263,** Draft for approval by the Executive Committee, 4 May 2017; **Exh. RML-145,** Decision of the Executive Commission of Bank of Spain of 5 June 2017, Acta 25/17, Document, Bank of Spain, Minutes No. 25/2017 of Executive Commission Meeting held on 5 June 2017, pp. 3-4.\n\n633.\n\nIt is common ground that Banco Popular made formal requests for ELA, first in the amount of \u20ac 1.9 billion and subsequently of \u20ac 9.5 billion.568 It is also undisputed that on 5 June 2017, the ECB provided its Non-Objection to the Bank of Spain\u2019s grant of ELA up to \u20ac 9.5 billion.569 The Bank of Spain\u2019s letter of 5 June 2017 to the ECB further confirms that \"[a]ccording to the Agreement on ELA we have requested and received a *positive assessment from the ECB* supervision authority responsible for the microprudential supervision *of the bank of its solvency for the purpose of receiving ELA and of its liquidity position.* Additional observations (if any) on the bank\u2019s request or on the decision to be made by Banco de Espa\u00f1a have also been taken into account\".570 Hence, the first, second and fourth conditions were satisfied.\n\nSee *supra* 624-625.\n\nSee *supra* 625.\n\n**Exh. C-113**, Letter from Bank of Spain to ECB, 5 June 2017, p. 2 (emphasis added).\n\n634.\n\nThe main point in dispute is whether Banco Popular satisfied the third condition for the grant of ELA, i.e. \"the provision of adequate collateral in accordance with the report to be drawn up by the Directorate-General for Operations, Markets and Payment Systems describing the collateral, assessing the said adequacy and establishing the appropriate valuation haircuts to determine the actual amount of the collateral\". While the Claimants insist that they provided sufficient collateral to secure \u20ac 9.5 billion in ELA,571 Spain argues that Banco Popular only pledged collateral with a post-haircut value of \u20ac 3.902 billion, which meant that the Bank of Spain could only disburse \u20ac 3.8 billion in ELA (after covering \u20ac 102 million in expenses and interest), which it did.572\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB1, para. 110.\n\nRejoinder, para. 380.\n\n635.\n\nUpon a review of the entirety of the record, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that there was nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in the conclusion of the Bank of Spain that Banco Popular had not managed to provide sufficient collateral and to pledge it in accordance with the applicable requirements to justify disbursement in excess of the sum of \u20ac 3.8 billion that Bank of Spain had released to Banco Popular.\n\n636.\n\nTo start with, the Bank of Spain made it clear from the beginning that any approval of ELA was subject to Banco Popular pledging sufficient security, specifically:\n\na. On 4 May 2017, when the Bank of Spain pre-emptively authorized the provision of a potential amount of ELA up to \u20ac 1.8 billion, the Executive Commission specified that any potential disbursement of ELA to Banco Popular was subject to \"the provision of sufficient collateral\" *(aportaci\u00f3n de garant\u00edas adecuadas);573*\n\nb. The same requirement for sufficient collateral was repeated on 17 and 26 May 2017, as evidenced in the draft ELA contracts circulated by the Bank of Spain, which specified, *inter alia,* that \"the Bank of Spain may, at its discretion, refuse any requests for Credit [from Banco Popular] while the guarantees detailed in Clause 6 below have not been validly established in favour of the Bank of Spain and remains in force [...]\".574\n\nc. On 5 June 2017, on the basis of the drafts previously circulated, the Bank of Spain and Banco Popular entered into the ELA contracts, which once again made it clear that any disbursement of ELA was conditional on the assets used to secure any ELA amount being validly and effectively pledged. Clause 2.3 of the ELA contract reads as follows:\n\n\"At its discretion, the Bank of Spain may reject any drawdown request submitted by the Borrower. In particular, the Bank of Spain may reject any such requests if the Borrower or the Guarantor have failed to validly provide the Bank of Spain with the collateral security referred to in Section 6 below, which shall remain in full force and effect, in an amount sufficient to cover the requested drawdown and any remaining sums owed to the Bank of Spain at that time under this Agreement, including any accrued unpaid interest (as well as any late payment interest.)\"575\n\n**Exh.

No contrary \"expectation\", let alone a reasonable one, could have arisen from these \"pre-approvals\".\n\n638.\n\nIn support of their argument that Banco Popular provided sufficient collateral, the Claimants point *inter alia* to (i) internal emails exchanged between officials of the Bank of Spain, and (ii) letters from the Bank of Spain to the ECB.\n\n639.\n\nWith reference to the internal correspondence within the Bank of Spain,576 the Claimants maintain that [REDACTED], Director of the Risk Department of the Bank of Spain, confirmed that \"[Banco Popular] had posted collateral sufficient to support \u20ac7.787 billion in ELA by 4 June 2017; \u20ac8.426 billion by 5 June; and \u20ac10.034 billion by 6 June\".577\n\nSee, in particular, **Exh.

In the Tribunal\u2019s view, when read in the context of the then ongoing collateral review process, these emails make it clear that the Risk Department of the Bank of Spain had performed a preliminary valuation of certain assets on the basis of information shared by Banco Popular. Indeed, the first email in the chain from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] contains a number of important caveats:\n\n\"I highlight the following precautions:\n\n*\u2022 We have worked with the information provided by the entity. The integrity and reliability of such information has not been verified.* It is recommended that a *separate review* be carried out as soon as possible.\n\n*\u2022 The collateral\u2019s situation for the purposes of its pledge is not assessed by this department,* so we do not know if it can affect the effective collateral calculated in case there are problems for its pledge.\n\n\u2022 There are cuts that will need to be *recalculated when more accurate information is available* (either provided by the entity or by other bank departments). In general, conservative solutions have been chosen when there is not enough information and efforts have been made to apply similar regulatory references.\n\n\u2022 Calculations should be reviewed periodically. It will be necessary to request the entity to keep the information up to date.\n\nFinally, I must point out that the entity has changed several times some of the files sent which, besides forcing us to reprocess the information, indicates that the situation can repeat itself the next few days being difficult to predict the impact. This fact, as discussed in the first point, reinforces the need for an independent review of the reliability of the information provided, or at least compare and contrast it with information available from other departments to detect possible inconsistencies.\"578\n\n**Exh. C-349,** Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], 4 June 2017 (23:04 hours), translated at **Exh. C-349 ENG.**\n\n641.\n\nIn other words, none of these preliminary valuations to which [REDACTED] referred in this and subsequent communications related to whether the relevant assets could be, let alone had been, pledged in accordance with the applicable requirements. As confirmed in the email from [REDACTED], this was a subsequent step with which was entrusted to a different department within the Bank of Spain.579\n\nSee May Hearing Tr. [English version], 19 May 2021, 504:2-506:7 ([REDACTED]).\n\n642.\n\nNo other conclusion can be derived from [REDACTED]'s email to [REDACTED] of 6 June 2017 at 19:19,580 to which [REDACTED] attached a table reflecting an \"ELA value\" of \"\u20ac10.034 billion\" in connection with the assets identified by Banco Popular as potential collateral. The table does not support the allegation that Banco Popular had pledged sufficient collateral to secure \u20ac 10.034 billion. Once again, this figure refers to an internal estimate of the Risk Department of the Bank of Spain, which does not say that collateral in that amount had actually been pledged. At the hearing, [REDACTED] also confirmed that the term \"ELA value\" in this communication means \"the nominal value of the collateral, after filtering, then applying the haircut that has been determined by the Risk Department to be applicable to those assets\".581\n\n**Exh.

[English version], 19 May 2021, 497: 1-7.\n\n643.\n\nThat finding is not contradicted by two letters in which the Bank of Spain advised the ECB of the potential ELA disbursement between \u20ac500 million and \u20ac2 billion, and requested the ECB\u2019s Non-Objection to any grant of ELA exceeding \u20ac 2 billion. In the first letter,582 the Bank of Spain informed the ECB of a potential ELA disbursement to Banco Popular of \u20ac 1.9 billion (following Banco Popular's first ELA request). Governor Linde wrote to then ECB President Draghi as follows:\n\n\"The ELA will be provided later on today. [REDACTED]. The maximum ELA volume is \u20ac 1.9 bilion, to be disbursed if and when needed in tranches denominated in euros.\n\nAppropriate collateral for the purpose of ELA has been provided by the bank, consisting of loans and credits denominated in euros for a nominal value of 5,089 million euros. An average haircut of 58% has been applied to determine the value of the guarantee.\"583\n\n**Exh. C-111,** Letter from Bank of Spain to ECB, 5 June 2017.\n\n**Exh. C-111,** Letter from Bank of Spain to ECB, 5 June 2017, p. 1.\n\n644.\n\nIn its second letter of that same 5 June, Governor Linde conveyed to President Draghi that Banco Popular had told the Bank of Spain \"of the extremely acute liquidity movements they are experiencing\" and \"asked for an extension of the ELA to a maximum amount of 9.5 billion euros\". The Bank of Spain consequently asked for the ECB\u2019s Non-Objection to an ELA up to \u20ac 9.5 billion. Attached to the letter was a \"note prepared by Banco de Espana\u2019s staff concerning the situation of the bank\", which included the following passage:\n\n\"Appropriate collateral for the purpose of ELA has been provided by the bank. In particular, loans, credits, stocks and participations in different financial and non-financial firms with a total nominal value close to 40 billion euros. After applying the corresponding haircuts, the effective value of the guarantees covers the maximum amount requested by Banco Popular S.A. The interest rate that will be applied to the ELA will be that of the Marginal Lending Facility plus 1 percentage point.\"584\n\n**Exh. C-113,** Letter from Bank of Spain to ECB, 5 June 2017, p. 2.\n\n645.\n\n[REDACTED].589\n\nMay Hearing Tr. [English version], 19 May 2021, 486:2-7.\n\n646.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the language employed by the Bank of Spain in its letters to the ECB is indeed ambiguous and could thus either signify that information on potential collateral had been provided or that assets had actually been pledged as collateral. Be this as it may, such ambiguity is immaterial for a number of reasons.\n\n647.\n\nFirst, the ECB understood the mention of appropriate collateral as reference to *information* on the collateral. Indeed, the Governing Council confirmed as such in its Non-Objection Decision:590\n\n(e) took note that the ELA provision by the Banco de Esparta as specified under decision point (d) was assessed ex ante as not violating the monetary financing prohibition based on the currently available information;\n\n(f) requested the Banco de Espa\u00f1a to provide a detailed daily update (including pricing and haircuts) of the assets used as ELA collateral;\n\n**Exh. RML-163,** ECB, Governing Council non-objection decision, 5 June 2017.\n\n648.\n\nAccordingly, the ECB assessed the ELA provision by the Bank of Spain of up to \u20ac 9.5 billion ex *ante* and *\"based on the currently available information.* The reference to further \"daily updates (including pricing and haircuts) of the assets used as ELA collateral\" confirms that additional steps were required and that Banco Popular still needed to pledge those assets. The graph depicting the ELA process at paragraph 612 above shows that at the time of the ECB\u2019s Non-Objection, the pledging formalities are not necessarily complete (step 7). This is reinforced by Prof. Tirado\u2019s evidence according to which further assessments of collateral take place after the ECB grants its Non-Objection.591 In other words, through this letter the Bank of Spain sought the ECB\u2019s Non-Objection to the disbursement of a maximum amount of ELA. The letter is not a representation or confirmation by the Bank of Spain to the ECB - let alone to Banco Popular, who was not copied - that ELA would be granted.\n\nMay Hearing Tr. [English version], 25 May 2021, 1470:22-1471:3.\n\n649.\n\nMore importantly, whatever the Bank of Spain may have \"represented\", Banco Popular failed to pledge sufficient collateral. Indeed, the record shows that Banco Popular only pledged assets sufficient to secure \u20ac 3.8 billion of ELA,592 which it did receive.593 By contrast, Banco Popular failed to meet the legal requirements to obtain additional ELA. In particular, it did not pledge the shares it held in companies such as Aliseda, Canvives, Allianz, Wizink, TotalBank, Cevasa, Metrovacesa Suelo and Metrovacesa Promoci\u00f3n,594 nor did it provide accurate information regarding certain loan portfolios.595 These unpledged assets had a post-haircut value (or ELA value) of \u20ac 5.570 billion.596 Only the shares of Aliseda and Canvives accounted for a post-haircut value of \u20ac 3.309 billion.597\n\nExh.

Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the Bank of Spain to insist that Banco Popular provide the original share and mortgage transfer certificates or CTHs *(certificados de transmisi\u00f3n de hipotecas),* or furnish proof that the book value of the companies whose shares were pledged was positive.\n\nSee, e.g., Reply, para. 650 (taking issue with the \"Respondent\u2019s after-the-fact focus on formalities\").\n\n651.\n\nMr. Saracho, Banco Popular\u2019s then Chairman, testified before a parliamentary committee to the bank\u2019s shortcomings in identifying and pledging assets of sufficient quality:\n\n\"So the forty billion, when they [Bank of Spain officials] look at it, they don't like it, they don't like it and it's not capricious because the risk of that liquidity transaction is assumed by Banco de Espa\u00f1a; this means that we all assume it. It doesn't mean that Banco de Espa\u00f1a can whip out that money, that money belongs to the Spanish people. It is managed by Banco de Espa\u00f1a and they are responsible if it is lost, which is why they are very cautious and they didn't like the collateral I was offering. Besides that, some had defects in form. What does that mean? They were correctly recognised on my balance sheet and confirmed by internal and external audits. It seemed to me that I could have property holding companies of one hundred percent of the bank, but the shares were not registered and Banco de Espa\u00f1a did not regard it as feasible. I think Banco de Espa\u00f1a did exactly what any custodian would have done. It was prudent and it did what it could, amounting to three billion in the end. That's that, but it didn't go as far as five billion because it was unwilling, but rather because it didn't seem wise to give me five billion based on the collateral that I was able to put up.\"599\n\n**Exh.

In the record before it, the Tribunal finds no evidence suggesting that the Bank of Spain abused its discretion in applying the haircuts, or that the process was otherwise flawed or in breach of the applicable ECB principles.\n\n**Exh.

In the crucial days immediately before and after the ELA requests, email exchanges took place late at night and during weekends. Possible inaccuracies or ambiguities, such as the expressions in the letters from the Bank of Spain to the ECB just discussed, must be viewed in the context of the pressure and the need for urgent action in extremely short time. In sum, the Claimants have not shown any arbitrary conduct, evident negligence, or lack of transparency, let alone a \"complete\" lack of transparency and candor, in the Bank of Spain\u2019s handling of Banco Popular\u2019s ELA requests. In fact, as Banco Popular\u2019s last Chairman later acknowledged, \"I think [t]he [Bank of Spain] did exactly what any custodian would have done.

It was that determination itself that in fact pre-empted any (further) disbursement of ELA.\n\nRWS-3, para. 59; RWS-9, para. 67.\n\n658.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, Banco Popular itself requested the termination of the ELA process, as reflected in recitals XI-XI 11 of the ELA Termination Agreement.611 This was the logical consequence of its determination the night before that it was FOLTF and brought the ELA process to an end. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal fails to see how the Bank of Spain can be blamed for \"cutting-off\u2019 the process and how Spain\u2019s failure to provide Banco Popular with more ELA after both Banco Popular and the ECB had concluded that the bank was FOLTF could breach the Treaty.\n\n**Exh.

In addition, Banco Popular was implementing three measures to improve its liquidity ratio: (i) offloading its non-performing assets (\"NPA\")s; (ii) selling non-core assets; and (iii) carrying out a capital raise. The Spanish authorities failed to take these initiatives into account and instead decided to put Banco Popular into resolution.\n\nSoC, paras. 339-378; Reply, paras. 668-679; C-PHB1, paras. 148-188; C-PHB2, paras. 55-71.\n\nSoC, paras. 339-378; Reply, paras. 185, 200, 680(a); C-PHB1, paras. 155-171; C-PHB2, para. 65.\n\n661.\n\nSecond, the Claimants maintain that Spain brokered \"a backdoor\" deal with Santander.614 Being interested in purchasing Banco Popular since December 2016, Santander obtained information about Banco Popular\u2019s state of affairs in May 2017 through the virtual data room that Banco Popular had opened in the context of a potential private sale. In the Claimants\u2019 view, Santander thereby benefitted from an unfair advantage and was in a position to prepare for the resolution of Banco Popular before the Claimants or anyone else could.615 The Claimants also contend that the Respondent\u2019s privilege log makes it clear that there was back-channeling between Santander and Spain.616\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB2, paras. 69-70.\n\nSoC, para. 348.\n\nC-PHB1 para. 187, referring to **Exh.

It highlights that the FROB reached Santander and other banks only when the SRB instructed it to do so.629 Moreover, the Claimants\u2019 suggestion that Spain decided to deliberately damage the bank is implausible, because the potential failure of Banco Popular created a very serious risk of contagion to the financial sector.630\n\nSoD, para. 851.\n\nSoD, para. 928.\n\n668.\n\nFourth, the Respondent disputes that the resolution of Banco Popular was procedurally deficient: (i) the SRB and the FROB considered 35 potential buyers and approached five Spanish banks;631 (ii) the auction was carried out overnight to ensure the continuous operation of Banco Popular; (iii) the \u20ac 1 sale price was appropriate, because Banco Popular had a negative value. In any event, if a bidder believed that Banco Popular was worth more, it could have bid more than \u20ac 1.632\n\nNamely Santander, BBVA, Bankia, Sabadell and Caixa.

According to the Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. Ponce, even Banco Popular\u2019s CEO Mr. Emilio Saracho thought that \"it was a miracle that the resolution was able to go through\".633\n\nR-PHB1, para. 200.\n\n**iii.** ***Discussion***\n-------------------------\n\n670.\n\nIn their latest submissions, the Claimants have clarified that they do \"not seek to hold Spain responsible for the SRB\u2019s resolution to sell [Banco Popular]\" and asserted that \"[w]hile the FROB\u2019s role in that decision is an important factual element of the case which Respondent is simply unable to dispute, it does not form part of Claimants\u2019 case on liability\".634 In other words, while the Claimants do not \"contest the resolution decision\" as such, they seek to hold Spain liable for \"precipitating the resolution\" and \"carr[ying] it out\" \"badly\".635 Indeed, the responsibility of resolving Banco Popular lay with the SRB, a point which was accepted by the Claimants\u2019 expert de la Mano at the hearing.636 Being an act of the EU authorities, the resolution itself falls outside of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nReply, para. 451.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 57 (\"Claimants have never sought in this Arbitration to hold any European agency liable or hold Respondent liable for any European act or breach of European law. [...] Respondent is therefore correct when it states: 'Claimants have made little effort to contest the propriety of the overall resolution decision.\" Indeed, Claimants have not made *any* effort to contest the resolution decision, because that is separate and apart from Respondent\u2019s conduct and responsibility in precipitating the resolution and how it so badly carried it out\", internal footnote omitted, emphasis in the original).\n\nSee, e.g., May Hearing Tr. [English version], 22 May 2021, 864:13-866:18 (de la Mano).\n\n671.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case on FET appears to center around their contention that Spain \"reached a predetermined decision to sell [Banco Popular] to Santander in resolution rather than address the liquidity crisis\"637 and \"orchestrated a non-competitive fire sale that could not have fetched a fair-market value price for [Banco Popular]\".638 The Claimants have advanced a number of arguments in support of their theory, which the Tribunal addresses in turn.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 149.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 149. See also C-PHB2, paras. 58-59 (where the Claimants argue that Spain \"played the leading role in crafting and pushing for [Banco Popular\u2019s] sale by resolution\", in particular because \"it was the FROB which conceived of, pushed for and then implemented the destructive sale process\").\n\n672.\n\nFirst, the Claimants take issue with the selection of the so-called \"sale of business tool\" and contend that \"from the very beginning, Respondent pushed the SRB to utilize the sale-of-business tool, without any analysis or consideration of other tools\" that would have been available.639\n\nC-PHB1, para. 162.\n\n673.\n\nIt is common ground that the resolution of a bank such as Banco Popular is governed by the SRM Regulation.640 Article 18(6) of the SRM Regulation provides that the SRB \"shall adopt a resolution scheme\" if certain conditions are met.641 Pursuant to the same provision, \"[t]he resolution scheme shall: (a) place the entity under resolution\" and \"(b) determine the application of the resolution tools to the institution under resolution referred to in Article 22(2), in particular any exclusions from the application of the bail-in in accordance with Article 27(5) and (14)\".\n\nSee **Exh. C-20,** Regulation (EU) No. 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2014) OJ L225/1.\n\nNotably: \"(a) the entity is failing or is likely to fail; (b) having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures, including measures by an IPS, or supervisory action, including early intervention measures or the write-down or conversion of relevant capital instruments in accordance with Article 21, taken in respect of the entity, would prevent its failure within a reasonable timeframe; (c) a resolution action is necessary in the public interest pursuant to paragraph 5\". See **Exh. C-20,** Regulation (EU) No. 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2014) OJ L225/1, Article 18(1).\n\n674.\n\nArticle 22(2) of the SRM Regulation, entitled \"[g]eneral principles of resolution tools\", lists the following resolution tools:\n\n\"(a) the sale of business tool;\n\n(b) the bridge institution tool;\n\n(c) the asset separation tool;\n\n(d) the bail-in tool.\"\n\n675.\n\nThe SRB decided in favor of the sale of business tool on 24 May 2017 at an Extended Executive Session. The record shows that SRB did consider other resolution tools and discarded them. Such consideration is recorded in Article 5(3) of its 7 June 2017 decision, in which the SRB specifically discussed the bail-in and bridge institution tools and set out in reasons for discarding these solutions.642\n\n**Exh.

In particular: a) With regard to the bail in tool of Article 27(1)(a)SRMR (even if combined with the asset separation tool) it cannot be ensured that it would immediately and effectively address the liquidity situation of the Institution, hence, restoring it to financial soundness and long-term viability. Given the specific circumstances of the case, the sale of business tool would meet the resolution objectives more effectively than the bail-in tool of Article 27(1)(a) SRMR; b) With regard to the bridge institution tool (even if combined with the asset separation tool), given that the bridge institution aims to maintain access to critical functions and sell the Institution within a timeframe of, in principle, two years, and to the extent that the sale of business tool achieves the same result within a short timeframe, the sale of business tool is considered to achieve the resolution objectives more effectively than the bridge institution tool\").\n\n676.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Ponce, the then Chairman of the FROB, testified that the SRB had made its decision independently, based on an \"analysis of each resolution tool, and [...] discussion [of] the effects that would flow from the application of the sale of business tool as opposed to the bail-in tool\", which allowed the SRB to conclude that the sale-of-business tool would \"best preserve financial stability\".643 Mr. Ponce confirmed that the \"FROB did not press for the SRB to decide on a particular tool\".644\n\nRWS-6, paras. 44-45; See also May Hearing Tr. [English version], 20 May 2021, 639:8-9 (Ponce), according to whom \"what we [the FROB] did was simply agree with the proposal [of the sale of business tool] made by the SRB\".\n\nRWS-6, paras. 44-45.\n\n677.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, nothing in the record contradicts the documentary and testimonial evidence just referred to. There is no indication that the FROB \"pushed\" the SRB to select one tool over another. It also bears noting in this connection that the record shows that, in addition to the resolution tools envisaged in Article 22 of the SRM Regulation, both the ECB and the SRB looked for private sector solutions that could prevent the bank\u2019s failure and concluded that there were none.645\n\n**Exh.

On 30 May 2017, the FROB retained Jefferies-Arcano to provide \"advice to the FROB in the preparation and, where appropriate, execution of the resolution\" of Banco Popular.646 It is true that the firm\u2019s purported analysis of other tools may have been meaningless, as the SRB had already decided in favour of the sale of business tool one week earlier. However, this fact in and of itself does not prove that the FROB influenced or pressured the SRB to choose a given tool, let alone that the SRB\u2019s choice in that regard was arbitrary.\n\n**Exh.

For them, the auction was flawed because (i) \"instead of reaching out to foreign banks and financial institutions, Respondent narrowed the search to only five Spanish banks - Santander, Bankia, Sabadell, CaixaBank, and BBVA\";648 (ii) \"instead of giving bidders a meaningful due diligence period, Respondent provided an impossibly small window that effectively eliminated all bidders except the one bidder who had concluded its diligence in the private sale process\";649 (iii) \"[i]nstead of seeking the highest sale price, Respondent signaled to Santander that an offer of a mere Euro would suffice to seal the deal\";650 (iv) \"there also is strong reason to suspect that there was backchannelling between Respondent and Santander, and [...] Santander knew it would be the winning 'bidder.\u2019\"651\n\nReply, para. 22.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 178.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 182.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 185.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 186.\n\n680.\n\nTo assess this criticism, it is necessary to place the events relating to the auction in the broader factual matrix.\n\n681.\n\nFirst, in early 2017, Banco Popular\u2019s management explored the possibility of a *private* sale of the bank. However, that process did not result in any offers being made for a positive value. Indeed, Banco Popular\u2019s advisors had approached five large domestic banking groups, namely Santander, Bankia, Sabadell, Caixa and BBVA.652 Four of the targeted banks expressed interest and were given access to the virtual data room, but only two ended up submitting letters of interest and none of them submitted actual offers.653 In light of the outcome of the private sales process, there was thus nothing irrational or arbitrary in the SRB\u2019s decision of 3 June 2017 to direct the FROB to \"contact the five parties which ha[d] been invited to present non-binding offers in the context of the private sale process\".654 In addition, nothing in the record suggests that a foreign bank ever manifested an interest in purchasing Banco Popular. The argument that Spain should have \"reached out\" to foreign financial institutions thus lacks factual support.\n\n**Exh.

C-138,** SRB, Decision of the Executive Session of the Board concerning the marketing of Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol, S.A. (No. SRB/EES/2017/06), 3 June 2017, Article 2, in which the SRB directed the FROB to \"contact the five parties which ha[d] been invited to present non-binding offers in the context of the private sale process\" and gave reasons for that choice (\"Contacting these five parties is justified on the basis of financial stability grounds and the substantial risk that marketing to a wider circle of potential purchasers and the disclosure of risks and valuations or the identification of critical and non-critical functions in respect of the [bjank may result in additional uncertainty and in a loss of market confidence. Moreover, contacting a wider number of purchasers might increase the probability of leakage and thus, the risk that the [b]ank may enter resolution within an extremely short timeframe. Further, due to the urgency and the very limited time that is expected to be available for the marketing procedure, inviting a larger number of participants would increase the complexity of the process. Moreover, based on the information received from the [bjank, it is doubtful whether bidders that have not shown interest so far in the private sales process would submit offers\").\n\n682.\n\nStill in connection with the SRB\u2019s choice to direct the FROB to contact only \"the five parties which ha[d] been invited to present non-binding offers in the context of the private sale process\",655 the Tribunal notes that such decision reflects the conclusion reached by Lazard, i.e. Banco Popular\u2019s own advisor during the private sale process. Lazard had \"assess[ed] the potential interest in [a private sale of Banco Popular] of a large universe of candidates around the world, not only national and international banks as well as investment firms with track record of investing in regulated financial institutions\".656 Specifically, it had \"carried out a sounding of the interest of 35 potential bidders (5 national entities, 25 international banks and 4 investment firms), at the highest levels of the institutions supported by its worldwide network\".657 However, none of those international banks and investment firms had shown any interest in purchasing Banco Popular.658 In Lazard\u2019s own words, \"the most interested parties in Banco Popular would be BBVA and Banco Santander, as they would be able to extract more synergies out of the potential integration\".659 A similar conclusion was also reached by Deutsche Bank in a report prepared for Banco Popular in December 2016.660\n\n**Exh.

It must be assessed in light of Banco Popular\u2019s value at that time. In the independent valuation report prepared upon the instruction of the SRB, Deloitte had given a \"best estimate\" equal to *negative* \u20ac 2 billion.661 Moreover, immediately after Santander completed the purchase, it had to inject \u20ac 13 billion to stabilize Banco Popular. In any event, the \u20ac 1 price was set as a minimum and the auction was a \"blind\" one, i.e. bidders were not allowed to see one another\u2019s bids. Consequently, a bidder believing that Banco Popular was worth more could have bid more. The fact is that there were no such bidders.\n\nSee **Exh. C-128,** Deloitte & SRB, Hippocrates Provisional Valuation Report, 6 June 2017, p. 1. Deloitte also assessed whether the shareholders and creditors of Banco Popular would receive better treatment if Banco Popular entered into insolvency proceedings and concluded that shareholders and subordinated creditors would achieve no recovery in a liquidation scenario. See ibid., pp. 13-15 and executive summary, pp. 1-9.\n\n684.\n\nThird, the urgency with which the auction was carried out appears unsurprising. To start with, the relevant text of the SRM recommends a time frame to complete a resolution no longer than 32 hours.662 Moreover, a speedy action was necessary in the circumstances in light of the precipitating events linked to Banco Popular\u2019s liquidity crisis. Further, given the significant amount of information about Banco Popular that potential bidders would have needed to process, it was understandable that only Santander-which had already conducted a due diligence in early May 2017-decided to participate in the auction.\n\n**Exh. RML-068,** European Commission, Memo on the Single Resolution Mechanism and Banking Union, 15 April 2014, available at http://Europa.eu/rapid/press-release\\_MEMO-14-295\\_en.htm?locale=en (\"All this is foreseen to happen within very tight deadlines, in total 32 hours, in order to allow resolving an ailing bank over the weekend\").\n\n685.\n\nIn addition, in light of the urgency caused by the liquidity crisis and the need to avoid further money outflows, an operation such as the resolution of a bank must by nature be subject to confidentiality. Indeed, pursuant to the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (the \"BRRD\"), resolution authorities are required to take steps to ensure confidentiality before the relevant decision is taken.663 Hence, one understands that the Claimants were not notified of the forthcoming resolution decision.\n\n**Exh. RL-0139,** European Commission, European Parliament Directive establishing a framework for the restructuring and resolution of credit institutions and investment service companies and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No. 1093/2010 and (EU) No. 648/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council, 15 May 2014 (\"BRRD\"), para. 86.\n\n686.\n\nFinally, regarding the alleged \"back-channeling\" or \"backdoor\" communications between Spain and Santander, the Claimants point in particular to Spain\u2019s privilege log, which includes [REDACTED]. In light of Spain\u2019s refusal to produce these communications, they request that the Tribunal \"should draw the adverse inference that these communications discussed opportunities for Santander to acquire [Banco Popular] via resolution, including the terms that Santander was prepared to accept\".664 The Tribunal will address the Claimants\u2019 numerous requests for adverse inferences in the following section. As will be explained below, the Respondent has provided satisfactory explanations for its failure to produce a number of ECB- and SRB-related documents, including the emails at issue here, as a result of those institutions\u2019 objections to disclosure on grounds of confidentiality, privilege or institutional sensitivity or secrecy. This notwithstanding, the Tribunal notes that in any event, the emails at issue here, which the Respondent\u2019s privilege log describes as '[REDACTED],665 *were sent from*[REDACTED] (and not vice versa) and there is no indication in the privilege log or elsewhere in the record that the Bank of Spain replied to them. The Tribunal does not find it exceptional or surprising that a Spanish bank communicates with the Bank of Spain or the ECB in the context of the ECB\u2019s ongoing supervision. It thus considers the Claimants\u2019 allegation that these emails constitute \"backchannel\" or \"backdoor\" communications unfounded. Finally, even if in these emails Santander expressed an interest in acquiring Banco Popular via resolution, that purported expression of interest would in itself not constitute evidence that Spain carried out the resolution in an improper manner.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 153.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Privilege Log - ECB Documents, Entry Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 (describing four emails from Santander to Bank of Spain). See also Entry Nos. 4 and 6 (describing two emails from Santander to the ECB, with copy to the Bank of Spain).\n\n687.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants have not succeeded in establishing that the \"Respondent engineered [Banco Popular\u2019s] resolution and the sham auction that resulted in the fire sale to Banco Santander\".666 To the contrary, having regard to the entirety of the evidence, it appears clear that Banco Popular was placed under resolution because it was unable to pledge sufficient collateral and, accordingly, obtain additional ELA and because it was determined to be FOLTF.667 Under the circumstances, proceeding with the resolution pursuant to Santander\u2019s offer was almost inevitable in order to ensure the continuity of the critical functions of Banco Popular, avoid the risk of contagion to other financial institutions and businesses, and protect the stability of the financial system.\n\nReply, section IV.B.2(e) (heading).\n\nSee *supra* sect. VI.B.2.d.iii.\n\n**f.** ***The Claimants\u2019 requests for adverse inferences***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n688.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal addresses the Claimants\u2019 request for adverse inferences. In their submissions, the Claimants have put forward numerous, far-reaching requests for adverse inferences. In particular, Annex B to their Reply is entirely devoted to those requests and spans over 55 pages. In that Annex, the Claimants have made request for adverse inference in connection with each of the document production requests with which, in their view, the Respondent has not complied. In respect of some of the document production requests, the Claimants have gone as far as making no less than fourteen different adverse inference requests.\n\n689.\n\nAlthough the BIT and the UNCITRAL Rules are silent on the drawing of adverse inferences, the Tribunal considers that it is empowered to draw adverse inferences from a party\u2019s non-compliance with a document production order. As set forth in Article 9(6) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence, from which the Tribunal may take guidance,668 \"[i]f a Party fails *without satisfactory explanation* to produce any Document requested in a Request to Produce to which it has not objected in due time or fails to produce any Document ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal may infer that such document would be adverse to the interests of that Party\".669 Therefore, the first condition for an adverse inference is that the party ordered to produce has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not producing a document.\n\nSee PO1, para. 24.\n\nIBA Rules, Article 9(6) (emphasis added).\n\n690.\n\nIn addition to that requirement, drawing an adverse inference is subject to a number of conditions. In this connection, the Claimants rely on the conditions or factors put forward by Jeremy Sharpe as guidance (to which the Claimants refer as the \"Sharpe test\").670 Indeed, Sharpe observes that, before drawing adverse inferences, \"arbitrators must satisfy themselves of the appropriateness of doing so in the circumstances of each case\".671 To that end, he proposes the following requirements for adverse inferences, whereby the third one is particularly relevant to the present dispute:\n\n\"(1) the party seeking the adverse inference must produce all available evidence corroborating the inference sought;\n\n(2) the requested evidence must be accessible to the inference opponent;\n\n(3) the inference sought must be *reasonable, consistent with facts in the record* and logically related to the likely nature of the evidence withheld;\n\n(4) the party seeking the adverse inference must produce *prima facie* evidence; and\n\n(5) the inference opponent must know, or have reason to know, of its obligation to produce evidence rebutting the adverse inference sought.\"672\n\nReply, Annex B, para. 6 (\"The 'Sharpe test\u2019 is the most comprehensive and widely accepted test on adverse inferences in arbitration, and it provides five elements for tribunals to consider in finding adverse inferences\").\n\n**Exh. CL-316,** J. K. Sharpe, *Drawing Adverse Inferences from the Non-production of Evidence,* in LCIA Arbitration International, Vol. 22 No. 4 (2006), p. 551.\n\n**Exh. CL-316,** J. K. Sharpe, *Drawing Adverse Inferences from the Non-production of Evidence,* in LCIA Arbitration International, Vol. 22 No. 4 (2006), p. 551 (emphasis added).\n\n691.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will review the Claimants\u2019 requests for adverse inferences bearing particularly in mind that an adverse inference must be consistent with the evidence on record and taking into account the Respondent\u2019s alleged reasons for non-production.\n\n692.\n\nFirst, the Claimants make several requests which relate to the so-called \"Withheld Documents\".673 To recall, the Tribunal held on several occasions that these documents form part of the file in the *Audiencia Nacional* criminal proceedings and are therefore subject to secrecy under Spanish criminal law. Further, in PO5, the Tribunal rejected document production requests in connection with the Withheld Documents, because contrary to Article 3.3(c) of the IBA Rules, the Claimants had not sufficiently established that the documents sought were not in their possession or control.674 Therefore, the Claimants may not seek adverse inferences based on the Withheld Documents, as the Respondent did not breach any document production order in that connection. For the same reason, there is no ground to \"adjust\" the standard of proof and/or \"shift\" the burden of proof to the Respondent on account of the Claimants\u2019 inability to rely on the Withheld Documents.\n\nSee Reply, Annex B, Adverse inferences Requested in Relation to Document Requests 37, 44, 47, 52, 53 and 54.\n\nPO5, Annex A, *sub* requests corresponding to the Withheld Documents. The Tribunal also recalls that, on 14 September 2020, it granted the Claimants\u2019 request for assistance in obtaining the Withheld Documents from the *Audiencia Nacional* and, on 29 September 2020, through the PCA, it delivered a letter to the *Audiencia Nacional* regarding the Withheld Documents. On 16 November 2020, *the Audiencia Nacional* denied the Tribunal\u2019s request for the production and use of the so-called Withheld Documents in this arbitration. On 8 December 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had taken due note of the *Audiencia National's* decision of 16 November 2020 and advised that, in light of the Court\u2019s ruling, the Tribunal was not minded to make any further document production orders at that juncture. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that it considered that the Claimants had not provided sufficient reasons why the Tribunal should reconsider its previous decisions in Procedural Order No. 5.\n\n693.\n\nA second category of requests for adverse inferences concern the ECB- and SRB-related documents, which triggered numerous procedural exchanges in the course of the arbitration. As explained in the following paragraphs, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has provided \"satisfactory explanation\" for not producing these documents.\n\n694.\n\nStarting from the ECB-related documents, on 1 July 2020 after the issuance of PO5, the Respondent, through the Bank of Spain, wrote to the ECB requesting the ECB\u2019s authorization to produce documents \"that reflect confidential ECB information or are otherwise in the possession or under the control of the ECB that are responsive to the [relevant document production] requests\".675\n\n**Exh. R-0352,** Annex 1 to Respondent\u2019s letter to the Court, 15 July 2020.\n\n695.\n\nOn 22 July 2020, the ECB informed the Respondent that it had reviewed a first batch of responsive documents and concluded that it could not authorize the Respondent\u2019s request that the documents be disclosed. The ECB stated as follows:\n\n\"Following a thorough assessment of the first batch of requested documents, confidential ECB documents related to supervision, we would like to inform you that these documents are part of the administrative supervisory files relating to the ECB\u2019s supervisory activities and in accordance with the requirements established by Decision ECB/2004/3, we regret to inform you that access to the identified documents cannot be granted (either in full or in part) since the documents and their contents are covered by a general presumption of non-accessibility under Decision ECB/2004/3, namely Article 4(1)(c) (\"the confidentiality of information that is protected as such under Union law\"), and for some documents in conjunction with the ninth indent of Article 4(1)(a) of Decision ECB/2004/3 (\"the purpose of supervisory inspections\") and the first indent of Article 4(2) of Decision ECB/2004/3 (\"the commercial interests of a natural or legal person\").\"676\n\n**Exh. R-0328,** ECB\u2019s Letter to Bank of Spain, 28 July 2020, p. 2.\n\n696.\n\nThe ECB explained in particular that disclosure of the requested documents \"would adversely affect the public interest in the smooth functioning of the system of prudential supervision\",677 and \"[was] likely to adversely affect the trust that supervised entities have that the supervisor will treat information confidentially\".678 The ECB also provided individual comments to the various document production requests in an annex to its letter to the Kingdom of Spain.679 For instance, in connection with the emails from Santander to the Bank of Spain with which the Claimants have taken particular issue,680 the ECB refused to authorize their disclosure on the basis that \"[t]hese documents are part of the administrative supervisory file related to the ongoing supervision of Banco Santander (Santander)\" and covered by the \"[g]eneral presumption of non-accessibility under Article 4(1)(c) [...] in conjunction with, Article 4(2), first indent, of Decision ECB/2004/3 [...]\".681\n\n**Exh.

R-0328,** ECB\u2019s Letter to Bank of Spain, 28 July 2020, p. 3 (This trust is essential to guaranteeing the exchange of information between the supervised entities and the supervisory authority, which is in turn crucial for effective supervision. Moreover, disclosing this information could undermine the supervisory methodology and strategy employed by the competent authorities).\n\n**Exh.

R-0328,** ECB\u2019s Letter to Bank of Spain, 28 July 2020, p. 4 .\n\n698.\n\nOn 25 August 2020, following the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to reconsider its ruling in PO5, the Respondent followed up with the ECB and requested the ECB\u2019s authorization to submit a \"privilege log\" as required under PO5.682\n\n**Exh. R-0332,** Letter from Bank of Spain to the ECB, 25 August 2020.\n\n699.\n\nOn 1 December 2020, the ECB informed the Respondent of its decision to refuse permission to disclose the second batch of ECB-related documents.683 Specifically, the ECB explained that a number of requested documents reflect[ed] exchange of views and information between the ECB and an NCB (Banco de Espa\u00f1a) in the context of and in preparation for the Governing Council\u2019s non-objection procedure as regards the provision of [ELA]\".684 In the ECB\u2019s view, disclosure of these documents \"would seriously undermine the preservation of a 'space to think\u2019 for the free and constructive exchange of views and information within the Eurosystem which is of essence for the ECB\u2019s ability to effectively discharge its monetary policy tasks, and thus undermine the scope for the opinion-building process in formulating and adopting similar decisions in the future\".685 The ECB also stressed that it was \"crucial\" for the national central banks, the national competent authorities, and the ECB to be able to deliberate \"candidly\", without fearing the risk that documents pertaining to such internal deliberations might be disclosed.686 While the ECB denied its authorization to disclose the requested documents, it agreed to the production of the privilege log in the arbitration.687\n\n**Exh. R-0443,** Letter from ECB to the Bank of Spain, 1 December 2020.\n\n**Exh. R-0443,** Letter from ECB to the Bank of Spain, 1 December 2020, p. 2.\n\n**Exh.

R-0443,** Letter from ECB to the Bank of Spain, 1 December 2020, p. 7.\n\n700.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied with the Respondent\u2019s explanations that it was unable to produce the ECB-related documents as it was prevented from doing so by the decision of the ECB on grounds of confidentiality, privilege or institutional sensitivity or secrecy. As is clear from the exchanges reviewed above, following the issuance of PO5, the Respondent undertook reasonable steps to obtain the authorization of the ECB to produce the documents. In addition, pursuant to PO5, Spain submitted a 53-page privilege log describing the documents that it was unable to produce due to the confidentiality protections. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis to draw any negative inference against Spain in connection with its failure to produce the ECB-related documents.\n\n701.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the SRB-related documents. On 3 July 2020, following the issuance of PO5, the Respondent, through the FROB, requested the SRB to authorize the disclosure of the SRB-related documents whose production the Tribunal had ordered in PO5.688 On 17 July 2020, the Chair of the SRB requested the Respondent \"not to share within the context of the arbitration proceedings confidential documents received or issued by the SRB or that otherwise reflect confidential SRB information, without the SRB\u2019s explicit authorization\".689 Further to additional correspondence between the SRB and the FROB in the subsequent months,690 on 7 January 2021 the SRB informed the Respondent that it objected to the disclosure of the requested documents as they were \"either: (i) subject to on-going litigation before the EU Courts to determine the extent to which they may be disclosed or made publically available (i.e. *sub Judice);* or (ii) part of the SRB\u2019s administrative file related to the resolution of [Banco Popular] which is subject to a presumption of non-accessibility in conjunction with limitations regarding their disclosure provided by Article 4(2), first indent and Article 4(3), second sub-paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001\".691 Notwithstanding this, the SRB agreed to the submission of the Respondent\u2019s privilege log in the arbitration as required by PO5.692\n\n**Exh. R-0330,** Letter from FROB to the SRB, 3 July 2020.\n\n**Exh. R-0325,** Letter from the SRB to FROB, 17 July 2020, p. 3.\n\nSee **Exh. R-0396,** Letter from the SRB to FROB, 7 January 2020, p. 1 (in which the SRB refers to \"previous correspondence\" from the FROB in connection with the disclosure of specific documents and the submission of a privilege log).\n\n**Exh.

R-0394,** Annex attached to the Letter from the SRB to FROB, 7 January 2020.\n\n702.\n\nEven though it reaches this conclusion somewhat more hesitantly than in connection with the ECB-related documents, the Tribunal is satisfied with the Respondent\u2019s explanations that it was unable to produce the SRB-related documents as it could not obtain the SRB\u2019s authorization and is bound to comply with the SRB\u2019s decision. As is clear from the exchanges reviewed above, following the issuance of PO5, the Respondent undertook reasonable steps to obtain the authorization of the SRB to produce the documents. In addition, pursuant to PO5, Spain submitted a privilege log describing the documents that it was unable to produce due to the confidentiality protections. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis to draw negative inferences against Spain in connection with its failure to produce the SRB-related documents.\n\n703.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that both with regard to the ECB- and the SRB-related documents, the Respondent has provided \"satisfactory explanation[s] [for its] fail[ure] to produce [the responsive documents] ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal\" in accordance with Article 9(6) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence.\n\n704.\n\nThird, the remaining requests for adverse inferences fail on their merits, as they are contradicted by evidence in the record, including documentary evidence. It would thus not be reasonable or appropriate to draw any inference based on non-production.\n\n705.\n\nMore specifically, numerous requests concern the resolution of Banco Popular. For instance, the Claimants request the Tribunal to draw the adverse inference that the \"Respondent initiated the planning of the resolution of Banco Popular before receiving instructions to that effect from the SRB and actively supported and drove the resolution process\".693 However, that inference conflicts with evidence on record which shows that the first preparatory steps towards the potential resolution of Banco Popular were taken at the EU level by the ECB, SRB and the EU Commission. Among other evidence, this fact is established by the SRB\u2019s resolution decision, which, under the heading \"Procedure\", states that the first step of the resolution process was taken on 2 May 2017 when \"the ECB organized a meeting of the institution-specific crisis management group to discuss the situation of the [i]nstitution\".694\n\nSee Reply, Annex B, pp. 5-6, 11-14, 16-18, 29-39, 42-44, 47-48, 50-55; Reply, para. 186.\n\n**Exh. C-52,** SRB, Decision of the SRB in its Executive Session of 7 June 2017 concerning the adoption of a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular Espanol, S.A., No. SRB/EES/2017/08, 7 June 2017, p. 7.\n\n706.\n\nStill regarding the resolution, the Claimants seek a number of adverse inferences whereby \"Jefferies-Arcano was instructed by [the] FROB only to invite the five Spanish banks that had demonstrated interest in [Banco Popular]\u2019s private sale process\" and not \"any other non-Spanish bank\" or \"any existing shareholder group of [Banco Popular]\".695 This inference is refuted by the record, for instance by Exhibit C-138, which confirms that the decision to invite only five Spanish banks was taken by the SRB at its session of 3 June 2017. As discussed *supra* at paras. 681-682, at that session the SRB approved \"the immediate launching of the marketing of the bank by [the] FROB\" and directed the FROB to \"contact the five parties which ha[d] been invited to present non-binding offers in the context of the private sale process\".696 That document also gives the reasons for this limitation to the five largest Spanish banks, lying essentially in concerns to preserve the confidentiality of the process, to avoid the leakage and thus loss of confidence which could jeopardize the sale and cause the resolution of Banco Popular.697 Still in connection with the role of Jefferies-Arcano, the Claimants have sought an adverse inference in connection with their document production request no. 73 to the effect that \"prospective buyers [were] alerted that it was going to be an expedited process, with a limited number of participants, and that prospective buyers could bid as low as \u20ac 1 to acquire [Banco Popular]\".698 Contrary to the Claimants\u2019 argument, the Respondent produced Exhibit R-174, p. 3, in response to document production request no. 73. In that connection, the Claimants complained that Exh. R-174 was \"incomplete\".699 Having reviewed the document and the Respondent\u2019s explanations that the \"[t]he last page of exhibit R-0174 is blank because of the manner in which that document was scanned\",700 the Tribunal concludes that nothing in the document suggests that the document is incomplete.

However, as discussed above in connection with Spain\u2019s refusal to grant more ELA, the documents in the record establish that Banco Popular failed to provide to the Bank of Spain the requisite collateral to support the amount of additional ELA requested.704 These requests for adverse inferences are thus unfounded.\n\nSee *supra* para. 359.\n\n709.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants\u2019 requests for adverse inferences and related requests to lower the standard or shift the burden of proof must be denied, either because Spain has shown that there was a valid reason for not producing certain documents or because the requests cannot be reconciled with the evidentiary record.\n\n**g.** ***Concluding remarks on FET***\n--------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants have not established that Spain\u2019s measures breached Article IV of the Treaty, as they have not demonstrated that the Respondent\u2019s acts or omissions were arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, discriminatory, completely lacking in transparency and candor in an administrative process, lacking due process \"leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\", or amounting to a \"manifest failure\" of natural justice in judicial proceedings.705\n\nSee *supra* paras. 515-517.\n\n711.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Tribunal were minded to apply a more generous FET standard as advocated by the Claimants through the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause, the outcome would not be different, because Spain\u2019s conduct would not run afoul of that standard either.\n\n712.\n\nThe difference between the standard which the Tribunal applied in its analysis above based on the formulation adopted in *Waste Management,* an award primarily relied upon by the Claimants as a \"particularly influential\" and \"seminal\" case,706 and the \"highest\" FET standard to which the Claimants argue to be entitled are not significant and limited to the following aspects.\n\nSee Reply, para. 489 (\"The formulation announced by the Waste Management tribunal has been particularly influential, as a number of other tribunals have since applied its formulation of the international minimum standard\") and para. 490 (seminal quote\"). See also C-PHB1, para. 14 (relying on *Waste Management).*\n\n713.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that FET prohibits conduct that is lacking in transparency,707 rather than *completely* lacking in transparency, as the standard in *Waste Management* requires. As explained in the preceding sections, none of Spain\u2019s actions or inactions breached the requirement of transparency, whether completely or otherwise.\n\nSee SoC, paras. 373-378 ; Reply, paras. 523-532.\n\n714.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants emphasize the stability and predictability of the legal framework, which is not referred to expressly by *Waste Management.708* The Claimants\u2019 arguments on this subject may be summarized as follows: (i) this sub-element of FET requires that \"business may be conducted in a normal framework free of interference from government regulations which are not underpinned by appropriate public policy objectives\";709 (ii) \"[t]he state breaches the obligation to provide a stable and predictable framework if it acts with 'evident negligence\u2019 or 'serious administrative negligence and inconsistency\u2019 in handling matters affecting protected investors\";710 (iii) \"[t]he requirement to provide a stable and predictable framework prohibits the state from deviating from the fundamental principles of its regulatory framework\"711; (iv) in this case Spain\u2019s conduct \"eviscerated the fundamental principles of the banking framework\".712 The Claimants further specify that they \"do not argue that the Spanish regulatory framework should have been 'frozen\u2019 in time, but rather that Respondent should have respected the legal framework in its dealings with [Banco Popular]\".713\n\nSoC, paras. 364-372; Reply; paras. 533-536.\n\nReply, para. 533.\n\nReply, para. 533.\n\nSoC, paras. 365-367, discussing in particular **Exh.

Irrespective of the fact that a mere violation of domestic law would not be sufficient to trigger international responsibility, the Claimants have been unable to point to instances in which Spain violated its own laws, let alone \"eviscerated the fundamental principles\" of the law.\n\nSoC, para. 368.\n\nReply, para. 535.\n\n716.\n\nFinally, in their latest submissions, the Claimants have emphasized Spain\u2019s alleged breach of legitimate expectations. Specifically, while the SoC only contained a few incidental mentions of the investors\u2019 alleged expectations, either without substantiation or in the context of other sub-elements of FET,716 references to expectations began to appear more prominently in the Reply and the post-hearing submissions, in particular in connection with Spain\u2019s deposit withdrawals717 and failure to grant the ELA.718\n\nSee SoC, paras. 91 (arguing that Spain bolstered Claimants\u2019 expectations that they had made a solid investment in Spain because then-Governor of the Bank of Spain Mr. Linde thanked Messrs, del Valle, Jaime Ruiz Sacristan and Antonio del Valle Perochena \"for the Mexican investors\u2019 important investment in Banco Popular, and assured them that Banco Popular was in good financial condition and run by good management\"), 339-340 (referring to the investors\u2019 alleged expectations in the context of the non-discrimination standard), 366 and 370 (referring to the alleged expectation to be treated \"competently and professionally\"), 374 and 377 (in the context of transparency).\n\nSee, e.g., C-PHB1, para. 68 (\"Respondent violated Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectation that the government would at the very least not take affirmative steps to harm [Banco Popular]\u2019s liquidity situation, particularly given Respondent\u2019s awareness of [Banco Popular]\u2019s solvency but vulnerable liquidity position and its obligation to maintain financial stability\"). See also Reply, para. 584.\n\nSee Reply, para. 633 (\"Respondent abused the responsibility and discretion it holds to provide ELA; generated valid and founded expectations that ELA would be forthcoming; only to stop that lifeline when [Banco Popular] depended on it, without prior notice, on vague grounds that have been flatly proven a lie by its own documents\"), para. 635 (\"[t]hrough [the] repeated interactions [between Bank of Spain and Banco Popular], Respondent led [Banco Popular] to believe that liquidity assistance would be forthcoming, as and when requested. *This was an entirely reasonable and legitimate expectation,* emphasis added).\n\n717.\n\nFor legitimate expectations to be protected under an (autonomous) FET standard, they must be \"legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment\"719 and based on a \"promise of the administration on which the Claimants rely\".720 Here, the Claimants have not proven that Spain created any legitimate expectations leading them to invest in Banco Popular and that it later frustrated. With regard to the deposit withdrawals, the Claimants have not sufficiently explained what the source of such expectations would be. With respect to the ELA, as discussed above, there is no right to receive ELA and its grant is discretionary and subject to strict conditions (in particular the pledging of sufficient collateral). The Bank of Spain never represented anything to the contrary to the Claimants, let alone before they made their investments. The Claimants\u2019 case on legitimate expectations would thus equally fail under an autonomous FET standard.\n\nSee **Exh. CL-15,** *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A., et al. v.

The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n719.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain denied them national treatment in violation of Article III of the Treaty.\n\n720.\n\nWith regard to the applicable standard, the Claimants submit that, to establish a breach of Article III, an investor must prove that its investment (i) was in \"like circumstances to another investment, and (ii) received less favorable treatment than that other investment.721 For the Claimants, two investors are in like circumstances if they operate in the same sector.722 Hence, Spanish banks that received the Respondent\u2019s support are appropriate comparators.723\n\nSoC, para. 381.\n\nSoC, para. 382, referring to **Exh.

Yet, in the Claimants\u2019 view, Spain treated that bank differently:\n\na. It allotted five years to find a buyer for Catalunya Banc and only three days to Banco Popular;\n\nb. It sold Catalunya Banc in two parts (the good bank and the bad assets), which it did not do with respect to Banco Popular; and\n\nc. It approached 81 domestic and international investors during the sale of Catalunya Banc and just five Spanish banks in case of Banco Popular.726\n\nSee SoC, paras. 302-307, 389; Reply, paras. 703-710; C-PHB1, para. 207; C-PHB2, paras. 93. In addition to Catalunya Banc, the Claimants also argue that Spain treated Catalan Banks generally more favorably, as the Respondent supported them with positive public statements.

Furthermore, BMN\u2019s shareholders received shares in Bankia as compensation, while the Claimants received nothing. Finally, the FROB contributed \u20ac 915 million in convertible preferred stock to the creation of BMN and subsequently further \u20ac 730 million.

The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nOn the legal standard, Spain argues that to establish a violation of Article III(1), the Claimants must prove that (i) the treatment granted to the Claimants\u2019 investments is less favorable than that granted to other investors or investments *in similar circumstances;* (ii) the resulting difference in treatment is linked to the Claimants\u2019 Mexican nationality; and (iii) there was no reasonable justification for the differential treatment.733 Spain adds that the existence of \"similar circumstances\" must be assessed \"with respect to the particular measures in question\".734 On this basis, the appropriate comparator in the present arbitration are Banco Popular\u2019s other shareholders, not other Spanish banks.735\n\nSoD, para. 959.\n\nSoD, para. 961, referring to **Exh.

Unlike Banco Popular, Catalunya Banc was operating normally, which enabled the FROB to implement a more organized sale process and invite a larger number of potential buyers over a longer period. Further, the investors of Catalunya Banc suffered as much as the Claimants did. Spain submits that Catalunya Banc\u2019s original shareholders \"lost the entirety of their shares and the entirety of their investment\" because they \"witnessed a substantial reduction in the value of their participation when [the] FROB contributed \u20ac1,750 million and acquired 89.74% of the bank\u2019s shares\" and \"lost the remainder of their equity participation when [the] FROB converted \u20ac1,250 million preferred shares into shares and then reduced Catalunya Banc\u2019s capital\".738 Third, the ban on state aid introduced by way of the BRRD in 2017, which applied to Banco Popular and not to Catalunya Banc, prevented Spain from adopting similar measures in case of Banco Popular.739\n\nSoD, para. 982, referring to **Exh.

See also R-PHB1 para. 229.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1295.\n\n731.\n\nSimilarly, in Spain\u2019s view, BMN cannot be compared to Banco Popular.740 When BMN merged with Bankia, both banks had been operating normally and had sufficient liquidity to continue doing so.741 By contrast, Banco Popular could no longer operate because of the liquidity shortage. In any event, the measures adopted with respect to BMN could not apply to Banco Popular, as the FROB\u2019s capital injections were made before state aid was prohibited.742 Finally, Spain highlights that, like the Claimants, the investors of BMN lost all or most of their investments.743\n\nSoD, paras. 984-999; Rejoinder, paras. 1283-1297; R-PHB1, paras. 228-230; R-PHB2, para. 138-140.\n\nSoD, para. 992.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1295.\n\nSoD, para. 987, 997.\n\n732.\n\nFinally, Spain contends that the situation of Liberbank is not comparable to Banco Popular\u2019s744 for a number of reasons:\n\na. Banco Popular experienced serious, publicly known problems whereas Liberbank did not show any considerable weakness;745\n\nb. Unlike Banco Popular, Liberbank\u2019s credit rating had been stable since 2015 and the share price enjoyed an upward trend since 2016;746\n\nc. The sudden fall in Liberbank\u2019s share price was not due to its deteriorating financial situation, contrary to the evolution of the share price of Banco Popular which had decreased gradually over a decade because of the bank\u2019s continuous financial difficulties;747 and\n\nd. Unlike Banco Popular, Liberbank did not experience any major deposit withdrawals.748\n\nSoD, paras. 1000-1007; Rejoinder, paras. 1309-1337; R-PHB1, para. 232; R-PHB2, paras. 134-137.\n\nSoD, para. 1005.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1321.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1323.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1333.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n733.\n\nArticle III of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall give in its territory to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment that shall be no less favourable than that given in similar circumstances to the investments of its own investors or to the investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor.\"\n\n734.\n\nIn examining whether Spain breached Article III, the Tribunal must first determine whether the investments of the Mexican investors and the investments of Spanish investors were accorded different treatment \"in similar circumstances\". In this connection, the Tribunal notes that, under the text of Article III, the \"similarity of circumstances\" is not a factor that relates to the investments taken in isolation, but rather refers to the *treatment* accorded to those investments. Indeed, as noted by an author, [t]he appropriate comparison will often be between the like-circumstanced *treatment* accorded the investments (or investors), rather than between the like-circumstanced investments (or investors) themselves\".749\n\nSee Andrea K. Bjorklund, *The National Treatment Obligation, in Arbitration under International Investment Agreements. A Guide to the Key Issues* (K. Yannaca-Small, ed., 2nd ed., 2018, pp. 532 ff., at 541 (Most of the attention is on the entity or entities to which the tribunal is comparing the foreign investment (or investor). Yet this focus can obscure an important nuance in the like circumstances analysis. The appropriate comparison will often be between the like-circumstanced *treatment* accorded the investments (or investors), rather than between the like-circumstanced investments (or investors) themselves. This emphasis explains the approach many tribunals take when they are identifying the appropriate comparators and is also consistent with the statutory language in many investment agreements. NAFTA Article 1102, for example, provides that: 'Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, *in like circumstances,* to its own investors...\u2019. The like circumstances qualification appears to modify the word \u2019treatment\u2019, rather than investor\u2019. There is thus textual encouragement for tribunals to be sure that their comparative analysis takes into account the regulatory context, as well as any market-based competition, in determining the identity of those in like circumstances with the foreign claimant.\" Emphasis in the original, internal footnotes omitted).\n\n735.\n\nSecond, in the event that circumstances were similar, the Tribunal must ascertain whether the treatment accorded to the Mexican investors was less favorable than the treatment accorded to domestic investors. Third, in the case of treatment that is less favorable, the Tribunal must determine whether any differentiation in treatment was justified.750 Even though national treatment (\"NT\") clauses in investment treaties (including Article III) do not explicitly say so, it is widely accepted - and rightly so - that tribunals adjudicating a NT claim must also ascertain whether any difference in treatment is justified.\n\nE.g., **Exh. CL-65,** *Archer Daniels Midland Co. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05, Award, 21 November 2007, para. 196; **Exh. CL-35,** *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, para. 399. See also Dolzer, Schreuer, Kriebaum, *Principles of International Investment Law* (3rd ed. 2022), p. 259.\n\n736.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the first step in the analysis, i.e. the identification of the treatment given to the relevant investments \"in similar circumstances\". The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot* that \"[b]y their very nature, 'circumstances\u2019 are context dependent and have no unalterable meaning across the spectrum of fact situations\".751 Furthermore, as noted in *Apotex,* the determination of whether a given claimant is in similar circumstances \"involves a highly fact-specific inquiry\", which requires a tribunal to look at a number of factors, including \"whether those which are said to be comparators\" \"are subject to a comparable legal regime or regulatory requirements, as the Claimants and their investments\".752 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, \"similar\" does not mean \"identical\". This entails that the assessment of \"similar circumstances\" must look beyond mere business sectors at the actual fact situation in which a business finds itself and at the regulatory environment surrounding the activity in question.753 In this latter respect, two or more financial institutions may be part of the same business sector, but the measures at issue may have been taken at different times and hence be subject to different regulations. The examination of similar circumstances must thus proceed from a careful review of the specific regulatory framework under which the treatment at issue was carried out.\n\n**Exh. CL-59,** *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits Phase II, 10 April 2001, para. 75.\n\n**Exh. RL-0196,** *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, para. 8.15 (internal footnote omitted).\n\n**Exh. CL-292,** *Grand River Ltd. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, 12 January 2011, para. 166.\n\n737.\n\nIn this case, taking all these factors into account, the Tribunal is of the view that the closest comparator to the treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investment is the treatment accorded to the investments of other investors of Spanish nationality *in Banco Popular,* because these investments were subject to the same legal regime or regulatory requirements as the Claimants\u2019 investments and the same measures in the same time frame. This being so, the Claimants have not alleged that their investments were treated less favorably than those of Spanish investors in Banco Popular. They have not made this allegation for the good reason that the measures of which they complain applied to all of the shareholders, regardless of their nationality. For this reason, the Tribunal\u2019s NT inquiry could thus stop here.\n\n738.\n\nThat said, even if the Tribunal were to examine the comparators which the Claimants have offered in support of their NT claim, these would not be \"in similar circumstances\" to the Claimants or Banco Popular (in relation to Catalunya Banc and BNM), or the difference in treatment would be justified under the circumstances (in case of Liberbank).\n\n739.\n\nFirst, Catalunya Banc and BNM were in situations markedly different from the one of Banco Popular, which makes a comparison between the treatment they enjoyed and the treatment enjoyed by the Claimants inapposite.\n\n740.\n\nSpecifically, with regard to Catalunya Banc, the Claimants focus on the sale of that bank and contend that the process for the sale of Catalunya Banc was more favorable than the one of Banco Popular. However, the sale of Catalunya Banc was part of a series of measures which the FROB adopted from 2010 onwards, which involved capital injections, conversion into shares and the sale of such shares.754 These options were available to the FROB as part of the regulatory framework in force at that time which allowed larger use of public funds to rescue banks in financial difficulties following the financial crisis of 2007. Specifically, under Law 9/2012, the FROB was required to disinvest the instruments to which it had subscribed within five years, through a process ensuring competitiveness under EU and Spanish law and maximum recovery of the public funds injected by the FROB in the restructuring of the bank.755 That framework changed significantly in 2014-2015 with the adoption of the BRRD,756 which was part of the EU and Member States\u2019 efforts to avoid taxpayer funded bail-outs. It was that new framework which applied to the crisis and subsequent resolution of Banco Popular resolution, and which restricted the FROB from taking the same type of measures it had implemented in connection with Catalunya Banc. The temporal and regulatory differences impacting the treatment given to Catalunya Banc and Banco Popular do not allow a comparison for purposes of Article III.\n\nSee **Exh. R-0031,** FROB\u2019s Governing Committee approves the recapitalisation of credit institutions, 30 September 2011 (erroneously dated 30 September 2001); **Exh. R-0099,** FROB Resolution of 26 December 2012 providing for the capital increase and decrease transactions in connection with Catalunya Banc S.A.; **Exh.

The BRRD was implemented in Spain in June 2015. See **Exh. R-0214,** Law 11/2015 on the recovery and resolution of financial institutions and investment service companies, Official State Gazette No. 146, 18 June 2015.\n\n741.\n\nIn addition, the measures concerning Catalunya Banc were carried out in different factual circumstances than those surrounding the resolution of Banco Popular. As the competent authorities noted at the relevant time in 2013, Catalunya Banc had \"healthy levels of solvency\" and a \"business plan that allow[ed] it to operate on a completely normal footing with its depositors and customers\" (translation of the Tribunal),757 which allowed the FROB to implement an ordinary sale process. That situation is entirely different from the emergency resolution of Banco Popular, in which on the day prior to the sale, the bank stated that it would be \"unable to attend its customers\u2019 deposits\" the following day758 and was declared FOLTF.\n\n**Exh. R-0106,** FROB press release, 4 March 2013 (\"La entidad [Catalunya Banc] fue recapitalizada en el mes de diciembre, mantiene unos niveles holgados de solvencia y dispone de un plan de negocio que le permite operar con absoluta normalidad con sus depositantes y clientes\").\n\n**Exh. C-116,** Letter of Banco Popular to the ECB, 6 June 2017, p. 2. of the pdf.\n\n742.\n\nThe same is true for BNM. The Claimants contend that \"[f]or BMN, the FROB helped it pursue a 27 June 2017 merger with Bankia, [...] in which shareholders of BMN were compensated with a fair exchange of shares in Bankia\".759 However, the BNM-Bankia merger was part of a complex and multistep restructuring process that began in 2010 when the FROB injected capital into both Bankia and BNM,760 at a time where the pre-BRRD framework permitted such recourse to public funds to bail out banks.761 As noted above,762 the BRRD was adopted in May 2014 and implemented in Spain in June 2015, i.e. five years after the FROB made the first capital injection in BMN. Once again, BNM\u2019s different circumstances rule out a comparison for purposes of Article III.\n\nReply, para. 711. In their discussion of BNM, the Claimants also contend that \"there was a range of tools that could have been used to assist and ultimately save [Banco Popular], including the ELA that the [Bank of Spain] confirmed would allow [Banco Popular] to overcome its liquidity crisis [...]\". See Reply, para. 714. However, Spain never granted ELA to BNM, which makes that alleged comparison in treatment between the two banks irrelevant.\n\nSee in particular **Exh. R-0109,** FROB Resolution, 27 May 2013, by which it was resolved to implement plans to manage hybrid capital instruments and subordinated debt instruments pursuant to Banco Mare Nostrum, S.A.\u2019s Resolution Plan; **Exh. R-0113,** FROB Resolution, 18 April 2013, providing for actions for recapitalisation and management of hybrid instruments and subordinated debt at BFA-Bankia; **Exh. R-0112,** FROB Resolution, 26 December 2012, providing for the capital increase and decrease and treasury bill swap transactions in enforcing BFA-Bankia Restructuring Plan; **Exh. R-0114,** FROB Resolution, 26 December 2012, ruling the issuance by Bankia, S.A. of debt instruments convertible into ordinary shares of the entity.\n\nSee **Exh. R-0213,** Law 9/2012, 14 November 2012, on the restructuring and resolution of credit institutions.\n\nSee *supra* para. 450 and fn. 756.\n\n743.\n\nRegarding Liberbank, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that, in the abstract, such entity could serve as a comparator to Banco Popular, as both banks were subject to the same legal framework regarding restrictions to short sales, i.e. the measure that in the Claimants\u2019 submission should have applied to Banco Popular. However, as the Tribunal has explained above in the context of FET, there were sufficient reasons for the CNMV to impose a short sale ban on Liberbank and not on Banco Popular shares. Any difference in treatment between the two banks was thus not unjustified under the circumstances. Hence, the NT claim in connection with Spain\u2019s treatment of Liberbank fails for the same reasons as the FET/non-discrimination claim, as it is premised on the same facts.\n\n744.\n\nIn conclusion, Spain did not breach the NT standard in Article III of the Treaty.\n\n**D.** **Expropriation**\n------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent expropriated their investment in Banco Popular. Although in one passage of their SoC the Claimants alleged that \"Respondent\u2019s acts *directly and indirectly* expropriated\"763 the Claimants\u2019 investments in Banco Popular, they have not substantiated their case on *direct* expropriation. In fact, in their subsequent memorials, the Claimants have exclusively focused on \"indirect\" or \"creeping expropriation\".764\n\nSoC, para. 396 (emphasis added).\n\nNeither the Reply nor the Claimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions any longer refer to \"direct expropriation.\n\n746.\n\nThe Claimants argue that an indirect or creeping expropriation is a covert or incidental interference with an investment that deprive the owner, wholly or partially, of the use or expected economic benefit of its property.765 Even if a single act is not expropriatory, several acts taken together may amount to an expropriation.766 According to the Claimants, the following measures indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 investment in Banco Popular: (i) the deposit withdrawals; (ii) the public statements by Spanish officials and Spain\u2019s failure to restore depositors\u2019 confidence in Banco Popular; (iii) the Respondent\u2019s unlawful suspension of the ELA; and (iv) the FROB\u2019s handling of the sale of the bank to Santander.767\n\nSoC, para. 395, referring to **Exh.

Spain could have used other tools to prevent Banco Popular from failing, for instance, issuing positive public statements, granting ELA or declaring a ban on short sales.773 Fourth, the resolution of Banco Popular was carried out in a discriminatory manner, without developing a \"competitive process\" as required under Spanish law.774\n\nSoC, paras. 401-404; Reply, paras. 778-786.\n\nSoC, para. 402; Reply, para. 783.\n\nReply, paras. 740-742, referring to **Exh.

The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n749.\n\nSpain disputes having expropriated the Claimants\u2019 investment. It contends that the Claimants\u2019 shareholding in Banco Popular lost its value due to the bank\u2019s deteriorating financial position and mismanagement.776\n\nSoD, paras. 1018-1078; Rejoinder, paras. 1342-1380; R-PHB1, paras. 233-246; R-PHB2, paras. 143-155.\n\n750.\n\nAccording to Spain, an indirect expropriation is a substantial deprivation of an investment, rather than a simple interference with property rights.777 Furthermore, to be considered part of a \"creeping expropriation\", an act must be expropriatory \"either individually or in close combination with another action\".778 Additionally, no compensation is payable if an expropriatory measures is adopted for a public purpose.779\n\nRejoinder, para. 1345; SoD, paras. 1018-1021.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1345; SoD, para. 1028, referring to **Exh.

In any event, the refusal to grant \u20ac 9.5 billion of ELA was justified because Banco Popular did not pledge sufficient security.783 Finally, the bank was put in resolution by the EU authorities. Spain could not override their decision pursuant to the SRM Regulation. In any event, the FROB acted reasonably in handling the resolution of Banco Popular.784\n\nSoD, paras. 1018-1078; Rejoinder, paras. 1342-1380; R-PHB1, paras. 233-246; R-PHB2, paras. 143-155.\n\nSoD, para. 1031.\n\nSoD, para. 1033; R-PHB2, para. 148.\n\nSoD, paras. 1035-1036; R-PHB2, para. 149.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1365-1371; R-PHB2, para. 150.\n\n752.\n\nSpain further claims that the resolution of Banco Popular did not involve a taking of the Claimants\u2019 property and was, in any event, a valid exercise of police powers, for which no compensation is required. As an alternative to insolvency proceedings,785 the resolution of the bank did not involve a taking of the Claimants\u2019 property.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n754.\n\nArticle V(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall, directly or indirectly, expropriate or nationalize an investment through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (expropriation), unless it is: (a) for reasons of public interest; (b) on a non-discriminatory basis; (c) in accordance with the rule of law; and (d) upon payment of indemnification in accordance with paragraph 2 below\".\n\n755.\n\nSince the Claimants only briefly mentioned direct expropriation in their SoC and then pleaded exclusively indirect expropriation, the Tribunal understands that they have abandoned their claim that Spain *directly* expropriated their investments. Even if the Tribunal\u2019s understanding were incorrect, such claims has not been sufficiently pled, let alone established, the Claimants not having shown that Spain carried out a formal taking of the Claimants\u2019 investments, as the notion of direct expropriation normally requires.\n\n756.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will review the Claimants\u2019 case of *indirect* or creeping expropriation. In their C-PHB1, the Claimants summarized their claim as follows:\n\n\"Respondent\u2019s government withdrawals, harmful public statements, failure to make positive public statements during [Banco Popular\u2019s] escalating liquidity crisis, and abrupt suspension of ELA constituted a creeping expropriation that crystallized when [Banco Popular] was forcibly sold to Santander in a sham, prearranged auction that wiped out the value of Claimants\u2019 investments.\"790\n\nC-PHB1, para. 212.\n\n757.\n\nIt is clear from this quotation and from other submissions that the Claimants\u2019 position is that Spain\u2019s acts and omissions progressively harmed Banco Popular\" and \"crystallized\" in the \"forced\" sale to Santander.791 For the Claimants, the acts which cumulatively amounted to an expropriation are the deposit withdrawals,792 Spain\u2019s public statements and \"failure to act to restore confidence\" of depositors,793 the decision \"to withdraw the ELA that Banco Popular requested and was eligible for\",794 the resolution and alleged \"orchestration of the sale process\" and the \"sham, non-competitive auction of the bank\" that resulted in Santander\u2019s acquisition for\u20ac 1.795\n\nSoC, paras. 396, 398.\n\nSoC, para. 397.\n\nSoC, para. 397.\n\nSoC, para. 400.\n\nSoC, paras. 398-399.\n\n758.\n\nHence, the measures alleged to constitute a creeping expropriation are those also invoked in support of a breach of FET. This being so, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis may be relatively brief, as it has already examined each of these acts in the context of FET and found that none of them was illegitimate, unreasonable or otherwise contrary to FET. It is true that, in a creeping expropriation, the single acts composing the expropriation do not need to be expropriatory in themselves, because it is their combination that results in an expropriation. However, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, a combination of legitimate acts cannot, without more, amount to an expropriation. Here, the Tribunal has held in its analysis of FET that none of the acts complained of could be validly challenged. It is thus difficult to see how the sum of these acts could constitute a \"measure equivalent to expropriation\" within the meaning of Article V of the Treaty.\n\n759.\n\nMore specifically, in connection to the deposit withdrawals, in its FET analysis the Tribunal concluded that neither the Ministry of Economy, nor the Bank of Spain, nor any other organ of the Respondent had an obligation to take specific steps to prevent Spain\u2019s agencies, municipalities, and state-owned entities from withdrawing their funds from their Banco Popular accounts, which withdrawals conformed to the terms of the deposit agreements.\n\n760.\n\nFurther, although some of the statements or non-statements by Spanish officials may have been ambivalent, none of them was \"inflammatory\", \"alarming\" or otherwise inappropriate. The Tribunal has already distinguished the statements at issue in this arbitration from those that other tribunals found relevant for a finding of expropriation,796 and explained how Spain\u2019s statements are by no means comparable, whether in tone or substance. Moreover, the Tribunal has observed that the (non-)statements fell into the time frame when (i) Banco Popular released the results of an internal audit of its credit portfolio identifying certain issues related to the capital raise of 2016, which concluded that Banco Popular\u2019s 2016 financial statements would not need to be \"re-drafted\", but proper amendments would be included in the financial statements for the first semester of 2017;797 (ii) international rating agencies, including S&P and Moody\u2019s, downgraded Banco Popular;798 (iii) Banco Popular announced that no dividends would be paid to shareholders and that it needed to pursue a capital increase, private sale, or merger;799 (iv) lower than expected quarterly results were published, showing a loss of \u20ac 137 million;800 and (v) news were released about the \"[u]rgent sale of Banco Popular due to bankruptcy risk\".801 All of these elements must be taken into account when looking at the declining share price of Banco Popular on which the Claimants rely to argue that there was a \"substantial deprivation\" of their investments.\n\nSee *supra* 562-563.\n\n**Exh.

C-81 ENG.**\n\n761.\n\nWith respect to the ELA, the Tribunal concluded that Spain did not abuse the discretion it enjoyed under Spanish and EU law in refusing to grant further ELA, in addition to the \u20ac 3.8 billion in ELA which it *did* in fact grant Banco Popular (even though Banco Popular had no right to receive those funds). The Bank of Spain approved ELA disbursements of up to \u20ac 9.5 billion on the condition that Banco Popular would provide sufficient collateral to secure further ELA disbursements, which Banco Popular failed to do. The Tribunal cannot but reject the notion that a State could be held liable for expropriating an investment as a result of its refusal to provide funding to a bank in financial difficulties *when the legal conditions for such funding have not been met.*\n\n762.\n\nFinally, in respect of the resolution, there are multiple reasons why it does not give rise to an expropriation under the BIT. The first reason is that the ECB and SRB, not Spain, were responsible for finding that Banco Popular was FOLTF and for placing it under resolution.\n\n763.\n\nA further reason lies in the fact that the resolution was a valid exercise of police powers for which no compensation is required. Indeed, the applicable legal framework, which centers primarily around the BRRD, envisages the resolution of a bank as an alternative to insolvency proceedings and provides that the resolution authority may only order the resolution if it finds that the affected bank is FOLTF.802 In other words, the resolution regime established by the BRRD allows the resolution authority to use administrative measures to restructure a failing bank in a more rapid manner than in an insolvency proceeding. The resolution notably allows to preserve the bank\u2019s critical functions and ensure that depositors maintain access to their funds without disruption, while averting the threat to financial stability and the risk of contagion to other banks.\n\nSee **Exh. RL-0139,** BRRD, Article 32(1).\n\n764.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the resolution, coupled with the sale of business tool, constituted an exercise of regulatory powers for a legitimate and urgent purpose. If an administrative action like the resolution of Banco Popular could, without more, be deemed a \"measure equivalent to an expropriation\", then the complex legal framework on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions would be undermined and resolution authorities would be precluded or severely limited in the exercise of their powers. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, nothing in the Treaty suggests any such unreasonable outcome.\n\n765.\n\nFinally, to the extent that the Claimants allege that the resolution was the result of a scheme \"orchestrated\" to allow Santander to take over Banco Popular, the Tribunal has already concluded that such theory lacks evidentiary support. In addition, the Claimants have not established that Spain acted inappropriately in organizing and carrying out the auction that led to Santander\u2019s acquisition of Banco Popular.\n\n766.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the acts of which the Claimants complain is expropriatory in nature and/or capable of constituting an element of a creeping expropriation. Hence, whether considered in isolation or combination, the impugned measures do not constitute \"measures equivalent to expropriation\" within the meaning of Article V of the Treaty. The expropriation claim is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**E.** **Conclusion on liability**\n----------------------------------\n\n767.\n\nFor the reasons explained in the foregoing sections, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not breached the Treaty standards invoked by the Claimants. As a consequence, it dispenses with addressing *quantum.*\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A.** **The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------------\n\n768.\n\nThe Claimants request that the costs they have incurred be borne entirely by the Respondent.803 According to their costs submission, the Claimants incurred costs in an amount of\u20ac 13,616,154.30, excluding the advances paid towards the Tribunal fees and expenses and the PCA administrative fees.804\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 2.\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 1 (i.e., \u20ac 14,296,154.30 minus \u20ac 680,000.00 paid towards the advances on the arbitration costs as of 18 February 2022).\n\n769.\n\nFor the Claimants, while Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes that the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party, the Tribunal may consider the circumstances of the case and particularly the parties\u2019 procedural conduct.805\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 2.\n\n770.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent should bear all costs because it has engaged in dilatory and obstructive conduct that interfered with the Claimants\u2019 rights and significantly and unnecessarily increased their costs.806\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 2.\n\n771.\n\nThey note that the Respondent attempted to disqualify Arbitrator Park based on meritless allegations related to prior appointments by the Claimants\u2019 counsel. Furthermore, due to a supposed one-minute delay in the transmission of the Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim, Spain requested to terminate the proceedings. Regarding the document production phase, the Respondent refused to produce documents ordered by the Tribunal, \"continuing to rely on a justification the Tribunal rejected on multiple occasions, leading to extensive and unnecessary delays of the disclosure process\". Lastly, on several occasions between May and June 2020 the Respondent requested the suspension of the proceedings \"due to the passing of Mr. Ruiz Sacristan as his heirs sorted through difficult administrative issues\".807\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 3.\n\n772.\n\nAs a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s \"dilatory tactics\", the Claimants submit that they were forced to incur significant additional costs, and that the proceedings were unnecessarily prolonged.808\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 3.\n\n**B.** **The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------------\n\n773.\n\nThe Respondent seeks an award on costs, pursuant to Article 42 of the UNICTRAL Rules, ordering that the Claimants bear the costs of the arbitration, as well as the Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation. According to its costs submission, Spain incurred cost in an amount of \u20ac 12,021,894.08, excluding the advances paid towards the Tribunal costs and fees and the PCA administrative fees.809\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 1 (i.e. \u20ac 12,701,894.08 minus \u20ac 680,000 advanced towards the arbitration costs as of 18 February 2022).\n\n774.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion to allocate costs between the Parties, both in terms of procedural costs as well as costs incurred by the parties.810 Furthermore, it notes that the Treaty is silent on how to allocate costs.811\n\nR-Costs Submission, paras. 2-3.\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 2.\n\n775.\n\nSpain argues that among other factors, arbitral tribunals typically allocate costs based on the extent to which a party has succeeded in its claims and arguments. In this regard, it submits that during the course of these proceedings it has extensively proven that \"(i) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims of the Claimants, (ii) it has not breached the BIT in any way and (iii) the Claimants are not entitled to any right to compensation\".812 As a consequence, the Respondent maintains that it should never have been charged with the burden and costs of defending itself, and therefore asks the Tribunal to exercise its broad discretion to award costs in its favor.813\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 4.\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 5.\n\n776.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent asserts that in the event that Spain were to prevail in the arbitration, \"it is entitled to its costs on a full indemnity basis\", in which case the Claimants should be ordered \"to pay the amount of\u20ac 12,701,894.08 plus a reasonable rate of interest from the date on which these costs are incurred until the date of their actual payment\".814\n\nR-Costs Submission, paras. 5, 14.\n\n777.\n\nIn the alternative that the Tribunal were to uphold the claims, the Respondent argues that it should not be ordered to bear the Claimants\u2019 costs, since the case involved \"a number of challenging procedural and legal issues, which the Respondent addressed with professional and effective advocacy\".815\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 6.\n\n778.\n\nFinally, it submits that should the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay the costs incurred by Claimants, only those costs that are reasonable and incurred in connection with the arbitration can be charged, in accordance with Article 40(e) and Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Accordingly, the Respondent reserved its right to request the Tribunal\u2019s leave to file a submission regarding Claimants\u2019 Statement of Costs and its justification and reasonability.816\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 7.\n\n**C.** **Discussion**\n---------------------\n\n**1. The Costs of the Arbitration pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n779.\n\nArticle 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides for the Tribunal\u2019s power to fix the costs as follows:\n\n\"The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\"\n\n780.\n\nArticle 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules specifies the categories of expenses that qualify as \"costs of arbitration\" in the following terms:\n\n\"The term 'costs\u2019 includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\"\n\n781.\n\nThus, Article 40(2) recognizes broadly three categories of costs and expenses: (i) \"Tribunal Costs\" comprising of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Secretary; (ii) \"Party Costs\" comprising of the legal fees and other costs incurred by the Parties; and (iii) \"Administrative Costs\" comprising here of the fees and expenses of the PCA, including with regard to hearing and other expenses.\n\n**2. Cost Advances**\n--------------------\n\n782.\n\nAt the beginning of the arbitration, the Parties paid a first advance of \u20ac 150,000 each, i.e., a total of \u20ac 300,000, in accordance with paragraph 51 of the TOA. In April 2021, the Parties paid a second advance of \u20ac 180,000 each, i.e., a total of \u20ac 360,000. In August 2021, the Parties paid a third advance of \u20ac 200,000 each, i.e., a total of \u20ac 400,000. In November 2021 and January 2022, respectively, the Parties paid a fourth advance of \u20ac 150,000 each, i.e., a total of \u20ac 300,000. Lastly, in January and February 2023, respectively, the Parties paid a fifth and final advance of \u20ac 75,000 each, i.e., a total of \u20ac 150,000. Thus, the total of the advance paid by the Parties amounts to \u20ac 1,510,000 (i.e., \u20ac 755,000 each).\n\n**3. Tribunal and Administrative Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n783.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the Members of the Tribunal collectively spent a total of 1,596.4 hours as follows: Prof. Park 354,5 hours; Mr. Mourre 420,9 hours; and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 821 hours. In the TOA, it was agreed that the Tribunal\u2019s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of \u20ac 550 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.\n\n784.\n\nFor his part, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 748,50 hours. In the TOA, it was agreed that the Secretary would be compensated at an hourly rate of \u20ac 300 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.\n\n785.\n\nTherefore, the total fees of the Tribunal and the Secretary (excluding VAT) amount to \u20ac 1,102,575.00.\n\n786.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Secretary have incurred expenses in the amount of \u20ac 5,820.13.\n\n787.\n\nAdditionally, the PCA fees for the administration of the case and its registry services amount to\u20ac 131,679.00.\n\n788.\n\nOther costs, relating in particular to the hearings expenses, IT costs, catering, court reporting services, interpretation, telecommunication, courier fees, bank charges, printing and supplies, as well as the translation of the Award, amount to \u20ac 194,605.74.\n\n789.\n\nThus, the total costs of the proceedings amount to \u20ac **1,434,679.87,** detailed as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tribunal and Secretary fees | **\u20ac** | 1,102,575.00 |\n| Tribunal and Secretary expenses | **\u20ac** | 5,820.13 |\n| PCA fees | **\u20ac** | 131,679.00 |\n| Administrative Costs | **\u20ac** | 194,605.74 |\n| **Total Costs** | **\u20ac** | **1,434,679.87** |\n\n790.\n\nHence, subject to any further work that may have to be performed in connection with potential requests for redactions in accordance with section 39 of the TOA, the total costs of the proceedings amount to \u20ac 1,434,679.87. In conformity with Article 43(5) UNCITRAL Rules, the PCA will provide the Parties with a statement of account once the 30-day time period under Arts. 37 to 39 has elapsed unused, or the work in connection with a post-award remedy under Arts. 37 to 39 has been completed, or the work in connection with potential requests for redactions has been completed, whichever occurs later. Any arbitration costs in connection with potential requests for redactions will be shared equally between the Parties and each Party will bear its own legal fees in that connection. The PCA will reimburse the Parties any unexpended balance. Since the Parties deposited the total amount of \u20ac 1,510,000, the current balance amounts to \u20ac 75,320.13.\n\n**4. Allocation of the Costs of the Arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n791.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules sets out the standard on the basis of which the Tribunal must determine the allocation of the above categories of costs:\n\n\"1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\"\n\n792.\n\nThus, the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall \"in principle\"817 bear all of the costs of the arbitration. The second sentence of Article 42(1) grants the Tribunal the authority to apportion costs among the Parties if, in light of the \"circumstances of the case\", it decides that such apportionment is \"reasonable\".\n\nSee the English version of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides: \"[t]he costs of the arbitration shall *in principle* be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties\" (emphasis added), while the Spanish version reads: \"[l]as costas del arbitraje ser\u00e1n a cargo de la parte vencida o las partes vencidas\", without including the equivalent of the words \"in principle\".\n\n793.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the outcome of the arbitration. The Claimants have largely prevailed on jurisdiction and admissibility, as the majority of Spain\u2019s objections have been rejected. However, the Respondent has prevailed on liability and is thus ultimately the prevailing Party.\n\n794.\n\nTherefore, considering only the outcome of the claims and defenses, the Tribunal would determine that the Claimants should bear the entirety of the costs of the proceedings and 70% of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and other expenses.\n\n795.\n\nThis being so, in line with the second sentence of Article 42(1), the Tribunal has further reviewed whether other circumstances, in particular a Party\u2019s procedural conduct, would warrant a different apportionment of costs. In doing so, it has come to the conclusion that, while both Parties have generally conducted these proceedings in a professional and cost-effective manner, on some occasions the Respondent has unnecessarily added to the costs of the arbitration. For instance, on 12 September 2019, the Respondent requested that the arbitration be terminated as a result of the Claimants\u2019 *one-minute* delay in filing their Statement of Claim.818 In addition, the Respondent made numerous requests concerning the succession of Mr. Ruiz Sacrist\u00e1n, including by suggesting that the arbitration may need to be suspended,819 even though the Claimants had provided sufficient clarifications regarding the administrative difficulties Mr. Ruiz Sacrist\u00e1n\u2019s heirs were facing in sorting out his succession. Taking that conduct into account, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Claimants should bear 60% (rather than 70%) of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses, the allocation of arbitration costs set out in the preceding paragraph remaining unchanged. Consequently, the Claimants shall pay to the Respondent \u20ac 7,213,136.44 in terms of legal fees and expenses and \u20ac 717,339.93 in terms of arbitration costs, which had been advanced by the Parties in equal shares.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s \"Motion for the Justification of the Claimants\u2019 late submission of the Statement of Claim and, if not duly justified, the termination of the arbitral proceedings of 12 September 2019; Claimants\u2019 comments, 18 September 2019; Tribunal\u2019s letter, 23 September 2019, p. 2 (denying the Respondent's request and reminding the Parties \"in assessing the costs of the proceedings, it would take into account the procedural conduct of the Parties, and in particular whether such conduct delayed the proceedings or increased costs unnecessarily\").\n\nSee the Respondent\u2019s communication of 26 May 2020 and its letter of 1 June 2020 (referring *inter alia* to section (2) of article 1072c of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure).\n\n796.\n\nIn accordance with Article 40(2)(e) UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has reviewed the amounts of the costs claimed by each Party. Both sides have incurred costs which are certainly considerable. However, these proceedings were highly complex and involved a multitude of Claimants, numerous facts, many procedural questions, as well as difficult legal, regulatory, and quantum issues, with the result that the costs incurred appear commensurate with the complexity of the dispute and the high stakes involved. The Tribunal further notes that both sides have incurred costs that are broadly within the same range.\n\n797.\n\nThe Respondent has further sought interest on the costs awarded. Such request was made as early as in the Statement of Defense820 and repeated in the Respondent\u2019s following submissions. The Claimants have not taken issue with the principle that the Tribunal may award interest on the costs awarded. The Tribunal considers that, in order to account for the time value of money, the Claimants should pay interest on the costs awarded. Recent investment treaty tribunals have also awarded interest on costs.821\n\nSoD, para. 1196(d).\n\nSee, e.g., *Deutsche Telekom AG v. India,* Final Award, 27 May 2020, para. 356; *Casinos Austria International GmbH and Casinos Austria Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/32, Award, 5 November 2021, para. 610.\n\n798.\n\nThe next question is at what rate interest should accrue. The Respondent has made no submissions in this regard. In the context of interest on the principal amounts claimed, the Parties proposed interest rates varied between 0.85% (so the Respondent) to 8% (so the Claimants). On this basis, the Tribunal considers that the interest on the costs awarded shall be computed at a reasonable rate used in the financial markets, for which it uses the 3-month EURIBOR, compounded annually, and being specified that interest shall start to run 30 days after the issuance of this award.\n\n799.\n\nFinally, the Claimants make no mention in the cost submissions of any internal arrangements for a scenario in which jurisdiction would be upheld only in respect of some of them or only some of them would succeed on the merits. This being so, as the Claimants have brought their claims in an aggregate form, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to leave it to the Claimants to make any relevant determination on the apportionment of costs among themselves in accordance with their internal arrangements, if any, or otherwise.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n800.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\na. Subject to sub-paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) below, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute between each of the Claimants and the Kingdom of Spain and the claims are admissible;\n\nb. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes between the Kingdom of Spain and Alejandra Rojas Velasco, Georgina Rojas Velasco, Isabel Rojas Velasco and Mar\u00eda Rojas Velasco;\n\nc. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes arising out of deposit withdrawals that do not concern acts or omissions taken by the Respondent in the exercise of sovereign powers;\n\nd. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the public deposit withdrawals that occurred in 2015 and 2016 to the extent that such withdrawals predated the Claimants\u2019 investments;\n\ne. The Respondent did not breach Articles III, IV and V of the Treaty;\n\nf. The Claimants shall pay to the Kingdom of Spain the amount of \u20ac 717,339.93 as reimbursement of the costs of the arbitration, together with interest at 3-month EURIBOR, compounded annually, starting to run 30 days after the issuance of this award and until payment in full;\n\ng. The Claimants shall pay to the Kingdom of Spain the amount of \u20ac 7,213,136.44 as contribution to the legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration, together with interest at 3-month EURIBOR, compounded annually, starting to run 30 days after the issuance of this award until payment in full;\n\nh. All other claims and requests are dismissed.\n\nSeat of arbitration: The Hague, The Netherlands\n\nDate: 13 March 2023"}]}
