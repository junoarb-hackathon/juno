INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. CONTENTS OF THIS DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision arises from the jurisdictional objection made by Respondent, to the effect that \"all claims pending before this Tribunal be dismissed because the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in the light of ECJ\u2019s *Achmea* Judgment\".1 Respondent raised this objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on 4 April 2018, following the release of the *Achmea* judgment on 6 March 2018, after the Parties\u2019 exchange of written submissions, the hearing, and the filing of post-hearing submissions in this matter.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 69.\n\n2.\n\nThis Decision shall therefore address the implications for these proceedings (\"*Achmea* issue\"), if any, of the judgment rendered by the European Court of Justice (\"**ECJ**\") in Case C-284/16 *Slowakische Republik v. Achmea BV*, dated 6 March 2018 (\"**ECJ Judgment**\").\n\n**B.** **REASON FOR A SEPARATE DECISION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe *Achmea* issue is a distinct matter, unrelated to the remainder of the issues between the Parties to this arbitration. The Tribunal considers it appropriate and in the interests of efficiency and procedural economy to issue this separate Decision prior to any further ruling in these proceedings, in order to address the specific jurisdictional objection by Respondent with respect to the *Achmea* issue.2\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal recalls Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"[a]ny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute\". The Tribunal further recalls ICSID Rule 41(2), providing that \"[t]he Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence\".\n\n4.\n\nThis Decision is rendered without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s determinations regarding all other issues of jurisdiction, admissibility or merits in these proceedings.\n\n**C. BROADER PROCEDURAL CONTEXT**\n---------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis Decision is taken in the context of a dispute between Claimants and Respondent which was commenced by the Request for Arbitration dated 14 May 2012 of Vattenfall AB, Vattenfall Europe AG, Vattenfall Europe Nuclear Energy GmbH, Kernkraftwerk Kr\u00fcmmel GmbH & Co. oHG, and Kernkraftwerk Brunsb\u00fcttel GmbH & Co. oHG, submitted against the Federal Republic of Germany (\"**Request**\").\n\n6.\n\nThere is no dispute that all concerned Parties to the present proceedings are currently based in the European Union (\"**EU**\"). The five Claimants are legal entities within the EU, and Respondent is an EU Member State.\n\n7.\n\nThe Request was received by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") on 16 May 2012, and on 31 May 2012 was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 dispute arises out of Respondent\u2019s decision to phase out the use of nuclear energy. In the context of Respondent\u2019s decision, Claimants allege that Respondent has breached a number of obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\").\n\n9.\n\nAs mentioned at \u00b6 1 above, at this stage of the proceedings the Parties have exchanged written submissions. A hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum took place at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C., from 10 to 21 October 2016 (\"**Hearing**\"). Following the Hearing, the Parties have exchanged post-hearing submissions.\n\n**D.PROCEDURAL CONTEXT SPECIFIC TO THE** ***ACHMEA*** **ISSUE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nTurning now to the procedural context relating to the *Achmea* issue, it is relevant to recount a number of steps preceding the ECJ Judgment.\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 July 2015, the European Commission (\"**EC**\") filed an \"Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party\" in the present proceedings (\"**EC Application**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 7 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (\"**PO 13**\"), granting the EC Application under Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Rules**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 30 September 2015, the EC filed its \"Written Submission\" as a non-disputing party (\"**EC 2015 Submission**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 April 2016, Claimants submitted their Observations on the EC 2015 Submission (\"**Claimants\u2019 2016 Observations**\"). On the same date, Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal stating as follows:\n\nWe write to the Tribunal in response to Procedural Order No. 13 (dated 7 August 2015) which directs the Parties to file any observations on the EU Commission\u2019s amicus submission in the above referenced case no later than Friday, 29 April 2016.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal to conduct an *ex officio* assessment of the arguments submitted by the EU Commission on 30 September 2015.3\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 29 April 2016.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the release of the ECJ Judgment on 6 March 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their comments on (i) the implications of the ECJ Judgment on the present case, if any; and (ii) whether the Tribunal should invite comments from the EC in respect of the ECJ Judgment. On these points, the Parties provided two rounds of comments, first, on 4 April 2018 (\"**Claimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment**\" and \"**Respondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment**\", respectively) and second, on 23 April 2018 (\"**Claimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment**\" and \"**Respondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment**\", respectively).\n\n16.\n\nIn the meantime, the EC, by its email dated 19 April 2018, offered to update the EC 2015 Submission in light of the recent ECJ Judgment. Taking into account the Parties\u2019 submissions in their respective First and Second Submissions of 4 April and 23 April 2018, the Tribunal decided to grant the EC\u2019s request to update the EC 2015 Submission, and so by Procedural Order No. 36 dated 25 April 2018. Following this determination, on 9 May 2018, the EC filed its update to the EC 2015 Submission (\"**EC 2018 Submission**\").\n\n17.\n\nThereafter, both Claimants and Respondent filed their respective observations with respect to the EC 2018 Submission on 30 May 2018 (\"**Claimants\u2019 2018 Observations**\" and \"**Respondent\u2019s 2018 Observations**\", respectively).\n\n**E**. **RESPONDENT's JURISDICTIONAL OJECTION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent did not originally object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis of EU law. The issue of any potential incompatibility between intra-EU investor-State dispute settlement under the ECT and EU law was first raised in these proceedings by the EC, in the EC Application and EC 2015 Submission. Even after the EC 2015 Submission, Respondent did not raise a jurisdictional objection in line with the arguments made by the EC. Rather, in response to the EC 2015 Submission, Respondent \"request[ed] the Tribunal to conduct an *ex officio* assessment of the arguments submitted by the EU Commission\".4 Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection arose only after the ECJ Judgment had been rendered in 2018.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 29 April 2016.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal will give further consideration to the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s objection below. As further elaborated (see \u00b6\u00b6 104-106 below), irrespective of the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s objection, the Tribunal considers that it has a broad power to examine issues relating to its jurisdiction on an *ex officio* basis. In respect of the issue of the alleged incompatibility of intra-EU investor-State arbitration under the ECT with EU law, the Tribunal would have exercised that power to examine its jurisdiction *ex officio*, even in the absence of a jurisdictional objection by Respondent.\n\n**F. COSTS**\n------------\n\n20.\n\nIn respect of the issue of costs associated with the EC\u2019s intervention as a non-disputing party, Claimants objected that the EC\u2019s intervention would cause them to incur additional costs. In their letter to the Tribunal dated 31 July 2015, Claimants requested that\n\nany decision granting the [EC] Application be conditioned upon the Commission posting satisfactory security for the costs caused to the parties by its intervention in this arbitration.5\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter to the Tribunal dated 31 July 2015.\n\n21.\n\nIn PO 13 (see \u00b6 12 above), the Tribunal reserved the question of costs associated with the EC\u2019s intervention as non-disputing party, \"for future decision, at the latest in the Tribunal\u2019s Award\".6 The Tribunal considers it appropriate to address that issue now.\n\nPO 13, \u00b6 19.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal admitted the EC\u2019s intervention as a non-disputing party, on the basis that (i) the EC \"has a perspective and particular knowledge in relation to the ECT which is different than that offered by the disputing Parties\", (ii) it was likely to address a matter within the scope of the dispute, and (iii) the EC\u2019s interest in the dispute can be considered \"significant\".7\n\nPO 13, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.\n\n23.\n\nHaving admitted the EC\u2019s intervention for these reasons, the Tribunal holds that the EC should not be liable for any costs associated with these arbitral proceedings.\n\n**G. OUTLINE OF THIS DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn a review of the Parties\u2019 submissions and the EC\u2019s observations, including the ones filed following the ECJ Judgment, the Tribunal considers that the substantive issues arising out of the EC 2015 Submission and the recent ECJ Judgment overlap to a large degree. However, as a consequence of the ECJ Judgment, a number of new issues have arisen to which the Tribunal shall give due consideration.\n\n25.\n\nIn the following Sections, the Tribunal shall address the issues arising out of both the EC 2015 Submission and the ECJ Judgment together. In Section II, the Tribunal summarises the conclusions reached by the ECJ in the ECJ Judgment, and Section III sets out the Parties\u2019 respective positions in respect of the ECJ Judgment. Section IV describes the EC\u2019s observations on this issue. The Tribunal\u2019s considerations follow in Section V, with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions contained in Section VI.\n\n26.\n\nUnless defined herein, capitalised terms used in this Decision carry the definition applicable under the ECT.\n\n**II. THE ECJ JUDGMENT**\n------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe ECJ Judgment concerns the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic 1992 (\"**Dutch-slovak BIT**\").\n\n28.\n\nThe ECJ Judgment also concerns certain provisions of EU treaty law. In particular, the ECJ Judgment deals with Articles 18, 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\"). This Tribunal will refer to the TFEU together with the Treaty on the European Union (\"**TEU**\") as the \"**EU Treaties**\".\n\n29.\n\nArticles 18, 267 and 344 TFEU provide as follows:\n\n*Article 18*\n\nWithin the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\n\n*Article 267*\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:\n\n(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;\n\n(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;\n\nWhere such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.\n\nWhere any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.\n\nIf such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act with the minimum of delay.\n\n*Article 344*\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\n\n30.\n\nThe questions that were referred to the ECJ by the German *Bundesgerichtshof* (German Federal Supreme Court) were the following:\n\n(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the investment protection agreement was concluded before one of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after that date?\n\nIf Question 1 is to be answered in the negative:\n\n(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision?\n\nIf Questions 1 and 2 are to be answered in the negative:\n\n(3) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision under the circumstances described in Question 1?8\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 23.\n\n31.\n\nThe ECJ Judgment made a number of comments regarding the system of EU law, as follows:\n\n32.... it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties, or consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court. That principle is enshrined in particular in Article 344 TFEU, under which the Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties...\n\n33. Also according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves. Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles, rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other...\n\n34. EU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss that each Member State shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which the EU is founded, as stated in Article 2 TEU. That premiss implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised, and therefore that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It is precisely in that context that the Member States are obliged, by reason inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective territories the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those purposes any appropriate measure, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU...9\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.\n\n32.\n\nThe ECJ Judgment further referred to the obligation under Article 19 TEU \"for the national courts and tribunals and the Court of Justice to ensure the full application of EU law in all Member States and to ensure judicial protection of the rights and individuals under that law\",10 and stated that\n\n[i]n particular, the judicial system as thus conceived has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which, by setting up a dialogue between one court and another, specifically between the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of the Member States, has the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties...11\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 36.\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 37.\n\n33.\n\nThe ECJ answered Questions 1 and 2 set out in \u00b6 27 above in the affirmative. The ECJ ultimately did not answer Question 3. The ECJ arrived at its final conclusion in the following terms:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.12\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 62.\n\n34.\n\nArticle 8(1) of the Dutch-Slovak BIT states that \"[a]ll disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall, if possible, be settled amicably\". In the event that such a dispute is not settled amicably within six months, Article 8(2) of the BIT provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to an arbitral tribunal\".\n\n35.\n\nWith respect to the law applicable to a dispute to be decided by a tribunal established under the Dutch-Slovak BIT, Article 8(6) of that treaty provides as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n- the general principles of international law.\n\n36.\n\nTaking into account Articles 8(1) and 8(6) of the Dutch-Slovak BIT set out in \u00b6\u00b6 34 and 35 above, the ECJ found as follows in relation to the interpretation and application of EU law by a tribunal established under the Dutch-Slovak BIT:\n\n40. Even if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite the very broad wording of Article 8(1), is called on to rule only on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact remains that in order to do so it must, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting parties.\n\n41. Given the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in paragraph 33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States.\n\n42. It follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.13\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42\n\n37.\n\nThe conclusion reached in the ECJ Judgment, quoted in \u00b6 31 above, was based on the ECJ answering three intermediary questions, which were related to one another. These questions were formulated by the ECJ in the following terms (\"Article 8 of the BIT\" referred to below is the dispute resolution clause contained in the Dutch-Slovak BIT):\n\n[1] It must be ascertained, first, whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT is called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.14\n\n[2] It must therefore be ascertained, secondly, whether an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article 8 of the BIT is situated within the judicial system of the EU, and in particular whether it can be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.15\n\n[3] In those circumstances, it remains to be ascertained, thirdly, whether an arbitral award made by such a tribunal is, in accordance with Article 19 TEU in particular, subject to review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.16\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 39.\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 43.\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 50.\n\n38.\n\nThe ECJ answered the first question in the affirmative, stating that \"the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital\".17\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 42.\n\n39.\n\nThe ECJ answered the second question in the negative, stating that \"a tribunal such as that referred to in Article 8 of the BIT cannot be regarded as a 'court or tribunal of a Member State' within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore entitled to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling\".18\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 49.\n\n40.\n\nWhile examining the third question referred to in \u00b6 37 above, the ECJ found that an arbitral tribunal under the Dutch-Slovak BIT \"is itself to choose its seat and consequently the law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the award\".19 According to the ECJ, such potential judicial review \"can be exercised by that court only to the extent that national law permits\".20\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 51.\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 53.\n\n41.\n\nIn the *Achmea* arbitration, since the arbitral tribunal under the Dutch-Slovak BIT chose to sit in Frankfurt am Main, German law was applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the arbitral award. Under the German Code of Civil Procedure, such review is on limited grounds, \"in particular the validity of the arbitration agreement under the applicable law and the consistency with public policy of the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award\".21\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\n42.\n\nIn light of the above, the ECJ, with respect to the third question, made the following findings:\n\n56. Consequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT..., it must be considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.\n\n57. It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected...\n\n58. In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States.22\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the implications of the above-quoted passages of the ECJ Judgment are disputed between the Parties, primarily in respect of whether the conclusions of the ECJ Judgment apply to the ECT (which is an agreement concluded by the EU itself as a party, with all of its Member States, and with a number of non-Member States of the EU). These implications, and the Parties\u2019 submissions in this regard, shall be addressed in the subsequent Sections.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nAs stated at \u00b6 24 above, given the substantial overlap, the Tribunal shall address the issues arising out of both the EC 2015 Submission and the ECJ Judgment together. Since the Parties\u2019 submissions on the ECJ Judgment reflect their most recent position on the issues relating to EU law, the Tribunal considers them to update their prior submissions in order to take account of the ECJ Judgment, and shall primarily focus on those more recent submissions in the following Sections.\n\n45.\n\nIn the following Sections, the Tribunal will set out the Parties\u2019 respective positions regarding (i) the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection; (ii) whether EU law is applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction; and (iii) the implications, if any, of the ECJ Judgment for the present proceedings.\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n1. **Timeliness of Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nRespondent submits that its jurisdictional objection is timely, and disputes Claimants\u2019 allegations to the contrary. In this connection, it is Respondent\u2019s position that the ECJ Judgment creates a \"new procedural situation\", inasmuch as the ECJ found that EU law, which is of a mandatory nature, may not be bypassed bilaterally by the EU Member States. Respondent argues that it raised the jurisdictional objection as soon as this new situation occurred.23\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 50; Respondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6 27.\n\n47.\n\nFurther, according to Respondent, the fact that it did not raise this objection specifically on a previous occasion cannot estop Respondent from raising the objection now. This is because Respondent has always disputed the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction throughout these proceedings, albeit on other grounds, and has specifically asked the Tribunal to determine the EC\u2019s arguments in the EC 2015 Submission on an *ex officio* basis. Since the final award has not yet been rendered by the Tribunal in these proceedings, Respondent argues that its objection cannot be considered belated.24\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51; Respondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n**2. Applicability of EU Law to the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, for ECT-based investor-State disputes involving two EU Member States, EU law has to be regarded as part of applicable international law. In this regard, Respondent relies on the finding of the ECJ Judgment that EU law forms part of the domestic law of Member States, but also derives or originates from agreements under international law.25 In this regard, Respondent disputes Claimants\u2019 understanding of EU law as forming part only of domestic or internal law under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), since EU law carries a dual character.26\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 36(a); Respondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, 54; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 41; **RL-0018** , *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erom\u00fc Kft v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010 (same as **CL-0012**), \u00b6 7.7.6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 54-58; *citing* **RL-0142**, *Achmea B. V. v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2008-13, Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010 (same as **CL-0142**), \u00b6 228; **RL-0132**, *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015 (\"*Electrabel v. Hungary*\"), \u00b6 4.195.\n\n3. **Implications of the ECJ Judgment**\n---------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nRespondent contends that the findings of the ECJ Judgment are not limited to BITs between EU Member States, but must also be applied to multilateral agreements to which EU Member States are party, such as the ECT. The ECJ Judgment, thus, applies *erga omnes*, with *ex tunc* effect, and in respect of all international agreements between EU Member States under which an investor from one Member State may bring arbitration proceedings against another Member State. Respondent stresses the use of the phrase \"such as\" in the operative part of the ECJ Judgment to submit that the ECJ intentionally kept its findings broad.27\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18; Respondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 10-17; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 60; Respondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6 10.\n\n50.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, therefore, Article 26 ECT must be interpreted in a restrictive manner such that it is not applicable in intra-EU investor-State disputes.28 In this respect, Respondent argues that the applicable law provision in Article 26(6) ECT requires the Tribunal to interpret Article 26 ECT in accordance with EU law, including the ranking of EU primary law above the ECT for all EU Member States.29\n\nRespondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 36; Respondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 29.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the mere possibility that a case before an arbitral tribunal might touch upon EU law was sufficient for the ECJ to assume a relation to the interpretation or application of EU law. Respondent highlights the importance of coherence and uniformity of interpreting EU law, maintained through the system of cooperation in place between the ECJ and the national courts of Member States, i.e., the preliminary ruling procedure in Article 267 TFEU.30\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 20-29; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 33-37, 41, 45, 49, 55, 58, 60; Respondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6 11.\n\n52.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s position that the above factors apply even to tribunals resolving intra-EU investor-State disputes under the ECT, since the same situations and risks exist. This is particularly the case since, in its view, the ECJ would not consider an arbitral tribunal sitting under the ECT to be eligible to refer interpretative questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling. Respondent also points to the fact that arbitral tribunals under Article 26 ECT may have seats outside the EU, which reduces the likelihood of EU national courts sitting as *juge d\u2019appui.*31\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36, 49-52; *citing* the action brought by the Micula brothers to annul the Decision by the European Union Commission of 30 March 2015 on State aid SA.38517 (2014/C) (ex 2014/NN) implemented by Romania [ *referring to Ioan Micula*, *Viorel Micula*, *S.C.

KG*, ECJ Case No. C-102/81, Judgment, 23 March 1982, \u00b6 14.\n\n53.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent contends that the fact that the EU is itself a Contracting Party to the ECT, alongside its Member States (and third States), does not mitigate any of the above risks. Respondent\u2019s case is that the ECJ Judgment\u2019s carve out for investment agreements concluded by the EU is based on the EU\u2019s competence in relation to international relations with regard to direct investments, and on the fact that the bodies established to rule on such agreements concluded by the EU would amount to being courts within the EU legal system. According to Respondent\u2019s reading of the ECJ Judgment, arbitral tribunals under the ECT are not courts or tribunals within the EU legal system. Such arbitral tribunals therefore cannot ensure the autonomy of the EU, and the primacy of its legal order and the mutual trust in their respective judicial systems, since the ECJ is not certain to oversee the correct application of EU law in the cases heard by them.32\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 30-33, 38, 57; Respondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 5-8; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n\n54.\n\nAccording to Respondent, when the ECT was negotiated and signed by the European Communities, the possibility of ECT-based tribunals in intra-EU matters was not covered by the mandate. In this regard, Respondent relies on a Statement issued by the European Communities to the ECT Secretariat pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT, which it says supports the view that the ultimate power of the ECJ to issue rulings on EU law was not intended to be withdrawn by the ECT.33\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48; *citing* Statement submitted by the European Communities to the Secretariat of the Energy Charter pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT, Official Journal of the EU L69/115, 9 March 1998, which provides in part as follows: \"[t]he Court of Justice of the European Communities, as the judicial institution of the Communities, is competent to examine any question relating to the application and interpretation of the constituent treaties and acts adopted thereunder, including international agreements concluded by the Communities, which under certain conditions may be invoked before the Court of Justice\". For a more complete extract of the EU Statement, *see* \u00b6 185 below.\n\n55.\n\nRespondent submits that the obligation to respect EU primary law applies not only between two EU Member States, but also between an investor from one EU Member State and another EU Member State. Respondent argues that if Vattenfall AB continues to invoke Article 26 ECT as a basis for arbitration, it would be in violation of its obligations under EU law. In Respondent\u2019s view, such violation would be attributable to the Kingdom of Sweden which is the sole shareholder of Vattenfall AB.34\n\nRespondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; *citing* **RL-0143**, *Elaine Farrell v.

Spain*, where an ECT tribunal upheld its jurisdiction in spite of an intra-EU objection. In Respondent\u2019s view, the question of the transferability of the ECJ Judgment on ECT-based intra-EU arbitrations would have required an *obiter dictum*, which the ECJ generally abstains from.38\n\nRespondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6 16; *quoting* **RL-0144**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

Timeliness of Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nClaimants submit that the jurisdictional objection raised by Respondent in its First Submission re the ECJ Judgment dated 4 April 2018 is belated, since it has been submitted for the first time six years after the proceedings were initiated and 18 months after the Hearing.40 Claimants rely on Respondent\u2019s earlier submissions before the Tribunal where Respondent either stated that the Tribunal should consider the arguments in the EC 2015 Submission *ex officio,* or mentioned specifically that the EC\u2019s arguments \"are not the arguments of Respondent\".41\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 4.1.2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 4.2.3; *citing* Respondent\u2019s Responses to Certain Tribunal Questions, 31 August 2016, \u00b6 2.\n\n61.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent could and should have made the same jurisdictional objections in accordance with the time limit provided in ICSID Rule 41(1), i.e., together with its Counter-Memorial, or at least after the EC raised the same argument in the EC 2015 Submission. In this connection, Claimants submit that the ECJ Judgment cannot be regarded as a new \"fact\", and certainly not the one on which Respondent\u2019s objection is based. The actual underlying facts on which the objection is based, i.e., the contents of the EU Treaties, have not changed since the commencement of arbitration, and neither have the specific arguments that relate to this jurisdictional objection. Instead, Claimants assert that the ECJ Judgment only confirms the same arguments that could have been raised by Respondent previously. Further, it is Claimants\u2019 position that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection goes beyond the content of the ECJ Judgment and argues for an extension of its relevance to ECT cases.42\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 4.2.5-4.27.\n\n62.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent\u2019s belated jurisdictional objection should be disregarded pursuant to ICSID Rules 26(3) and 27.43 Further, Respondent\u2019s failure to raise a timely objection cannot, according to Claimants, be bypassed by the Tribunal assessing the same objection *ex officio* under ICSID Rule 41(2), especially when Respondent\u2019s failure to raise the jurisdictional objection in time was deliberate.44\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 4.2.8-4.2.9; *citing* **CL-0014**, *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v.

Applicability of EU Law to the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimants submit that EU law does not form part of international law, and is consequently not part of the applicable law for questions of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. In this regard, Claimants rely on the EC 2018 Submission and the ECJ Judgment to contend that the EC and the ECJ recognise EU law as being \"autonomous\" in relation to both international law and the domestic laws of the Member States.45\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 1.3.3-1.3.5; *citing* EC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 10; ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 33; **CL-0150**, P.

In Claimants\u2019 view, issues of jurisdiction are governed only by the ICSID Convention, interpreted in the light of general principles of international law, and the instruments containing the Parties\u2019 consent under international law, which in this case is the ECT. In this regard, Claimants draw a parallel between Article 26(6) ECT and Article 42 ICSID Convention.47\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 3.5-3.8; *citing* **CL-0060**, P.

(2009), Article 42; Claimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11.\n\n66.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, EU law, including EU law\u2019s principles of primacy and sincere cooperation, do not form part of the law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of its jurisdiction.48\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 1.3.6-1.3.7; *quoting* **CL-0217**, *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a.r.I. v.

Spain*, \u00b6 459.\n\n67.\n\nIn addition, Claimants contend that the ECJ Judgment was based on Article 8 of the Dutch-Slovak BIT, i.e., the applicable law provision of the BIT in consideration in *Achmea v. Slovakia*. That provision required the application of the law of the concerned Contracting Party to the Dutch-Slovak BIT and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties, and thus left open the possibility of application of EU law by the tribunal. On the contrary, Claimants argue that Article 26(6) ECT restricts the applicable law before the Tribunal to the ECT and \"applicable rules and principles of international law\". According to Claimants, this terminology in Article 26(6) ECT does not include EU law, and thus the Tribunal is neither authorised nor required to apply EU law. In this regard, Claimants also rely on the Tribunal\u2019s finding in Procedural Order No. 31 (\"**PO 31**\") that German domestic law \"forms part of the factual matrix of the case\".49\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 1.4.1-1.4.5; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42; PO 31, \u00b6 22; Claimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 36-37.\n\n**3. Implications of the ECJ Judgment**\n---------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIt is Claimants\u2019 submission that the ECJ Judgment does not apply to the ECT, since its findings are expressly limited to arbitrations under a bilateral investment treaty.50 Moreover, the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT, which implies that the EU itself has agreed to and approved the contents of the ECT, including its dispute resolution mechanisms. In this regard, Claimants rely on the express finding of the ECJ Judgment that the Dutch-Slovak BIT in question was \"an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States\".51\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 2.3.1; Claimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6 31.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 1.5.1; *citing* Article 26(8) ECT; Article 216(2) TFEU; Claimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 2.3.1-2.3.4; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 58 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n69.\n\nClaimants further characterise Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the ECJ Judgment as incorrect and expansive. In their view, the ECJ Judgment does not address the international law validity of arbitration agreements or dispute resolution mechanisms contained in BITs, but only addresses their validity from the EU law perspective. Claimants contend that the incompatibility of a treaty provision with EU law does not automatically lead to the termination of the said treaty provision, or to its retroactive invalidity. Termination of the ECT can only be achieved in compliance with Article 47 ECT and the VCLT.52\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 2.2.1-2.2.3; \u00b6\u00b6 4.3.1-4.3.2.\n\n70.\n\nWith respect to the interpretation of Article 26 ECT, Claimants dispute Respondent\u2019s reliance on the Statement issued by the European Communities to the ECT Secretariat pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT (see \u00b6 54 above). Specifically, Claimants submit that in that Statement, the European Communities (now the EU) accepted the possibility of arbitration proceedings under the ECT, even against itself, without making a distinction between investors from EU or non-EU Member States.53\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 2.3.5-2.3.7; *citing* Statement submitted by the European Communities to the Secretariat of the Energy Charter pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT, Official Journal of the EU L69/115, 9 March 1998.\n\n71.\n\nClaimants likewise dispute the interpretation of the ECT put forward by the EC, which in their view ignores the plain wording of the Treaty. Claimants argue that the EC incorrectly starts its interpretation with Article 31(3)(c) VCLT (\"[t]here shall be taken into account, together with the context:... (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\").54 In any event, Claimants contend that EU law cannot be taken into account under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT for the interpretation of the ECT, since the relevant rules of international law must be applicable in relations between all the parties to the treaty being interpreted.55\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 46-49; *quoting* **CL-0228**, ICJ, *Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the United Nations*, *Advisory Opinion*, ICJ Reports 1950, p. 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6 51; *citing* **CL-0229**, M.

In their view the EC\u2019s arguments are unsupported and untenable under international law.56 Claimants rather endorse the reasoning of the arbitral tribunals in *Charanne v. Spain*, *RREEF v. Spain*, *Eiser v. Spain*, *Blusun v. Italy*, *PV Investors v. Spain*, *Novenergia v. Spain* and *Masdar v. Spain*. Those arbitral tribunals held that a claim brought against an EU Member State relates only to the territorial \"Area\" of that Member State as defined in Article 1(10) ECT, and is not absorbed into the \"Area\" of the EU. Under this reasoning, the \"Area\" of the EU as a whole is only concerned when a claim is brought against the EU itself.57\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 56-65; *quoting* **CL-0231**, K.

In this regard, Claimants point to the absence of any \"disconnection clause\" in the ECT, which they had also highlighted in Claimants\u2019 2016 Observations. A disconnection clause, in EU treaty practice, is included to ensure that the provisions of a mixed agreement only apply vis-\u00e1-vis third parties and not as between EU Member States. Moreover, Claimants rely on Article 16 ECT, which, according to Claimants, specifically ensures that the investor\u2019s right to dispute resolution is maintained, regardless of the existence of other (potentially conflicting) commitments.58\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 1.6.1-1.6.7; *citing* **CL-0160**, *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.)

In Claimants\u2019 view, Article 351(1) TFEU cannot be applied *a contrario* to deprive individual investors of their rights under the ECT, since that provision applies \"where only rights and obligations of Member States are at stake\".59\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88, 91; *quoting* EC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 83; *also quoting Attorney General v. Burgoa*, ECJ Case No. 812/79, Judgment, 14 October 1980.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants also dispute Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to a \"harmonious interpretation\" of the ECT and EU law, stating that this argument has nothing to do with the interpretation of a provision of the ECT, but instead amounts to removing the right to dispute resolution. In Claimants\u2019 view, no harmonious interpretation is required, nor are Articles 30 or 41(1)(b) VCLT applicable, since Article 16 ECT specifically and explicitly governs the question of which potentially applicable rules take precedence over the other in the case of two conflicting treaties.60\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 4.3.13-4.3.16; Claimants\u2019 2016 Observations, \u00a7\u00a7 C.2-C.3; *citing* **RL-0132**, *Electrabel v.

Further, Claimants contend that Article 30 VCLT does not invalidate Article 26 ECT, *inter alia*, because there is no identity of subject matter between the treaties, no incompatibility between the provisions, and the ECT is the later treaty and therefore *lex posterior*.61\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 97-105; *citing* **CL-0229**, M.

Claimants also argue that pursuant to Article 27 VCLT, Respondent cannot escape its international obligations by relying on its domestic law, including EU law.62\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 1.6.8; Claimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 4.3.3-4.3.9; *citing* **RL-0038**, *Plama v.

In their view, if the ECJ held a different view, it would have indicated as much.63 Claimants draw support from the recent award by the arbitral tribunal in *Masdar v. Spain*, which followed a similar line of reasoning.64\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40; *quoting Slowakische Republik v.

According to Claimants, the ECT is an act of the EU institutions and forms an integral part of EU law. It follows, in their view, that the ECT is presumed lawful and legally effective and Article 26 thereof may not be disregarded or set aside. Further, they argue that the ECJ does not have the power under EU law to declare Article 26 ECT invalid.65\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 125-131; *quoting Maximillian Schrems v.

THE EC'S OBSERVATIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn this Section the Tribunal summarises the EC\u2019s observations regarding (i) the applicability of EU Law for the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of its jurisdiction; and (ii) the implications of the ECJ Judgment for these proceedings.\n\n**A. APPLICABILITY OF EU LAW FOR THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nIn the EC\u2019s view, EU law forms part of the \"applicable rules and principles of international law\" under Article 26(6) ECT, and the \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. The EC states that nothing in the ECT indicates that it operates as *lex specialis* vis-\u00e1-vis EU law. Rather, reference to EU law should form a part of the task of interpretation of the ECT pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. For this proposition, the EC relies on Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice and academic writing.66\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 36-42; **EC-0001**, A. Parra, \"Applicable Law in Investor-State Arbitration\", in Rovine (ed.), *Contemporary Issues in International Arbitration and Mediation: The Fordham Papers* (2008), pp. 7-8; **EC-0002**, T.

Hungary.* The disputed issue, especially between the tribunals in *Electrabel v. Hungary* and *RREEF v. Spain,* instead concerns whether the ECT prevails over EU law or vice-versa.67\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 36-42; *citing Electrabel v. Hungary* (same as **RL-0132**), \u00b6\u00b6 4.111-4.199; *Charanne B.V. and Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain*, SCC Case No. 062/2012, Award, 21 January 2016 (\"*Charanne v.

Spain* (same as **CL-0160**), \u00b6\u00b6 74, 75, 87.\n\n83.\n\nIn this regard, the EC\u2019s position is that the process of \"systemic coherence\" requires the ECT to be interpreted in such a way as to avoid any conflict with EU law, and not the other way around. For that purpose, according to the EC, an interpretation of Article 26 ECT taking into account the general principle of autonomy of EU law (Articles 4(3) and 19 TEU and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU) leads to the conclusion that there is no offer to arbitrate by Germany to Swedish investors.68\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 42-45; *citing* *Oil Platforms (Iran v.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE ECJ JUDGMENT**\n---------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn the EC\u2019s view, the ECJ Judgment, which confirms the position that the EC took in the EC Application and the EC 2015 Submission, renders the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 ECT \"inapplicable\" or \"invalid\".69 According to the EC, this is on the ground of the general principle of EU law of autonomy of the EU legal order, which is enshrined in the liberally interpreted Article 344 TFEU, and on the keystone of the EU judicial system, i.e., the preliminary ruling procedure, provided in Article 267 TFEU. In addition, the EC relies on Articles 4(3) and 19 TEU for the principle of autonomy of EU law.70\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 25; *citing* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36-37.\n\n85.\n\nIt is the EC\u2019s position that the ECJ Judgment applies equally to intra-EU investor-State arbitrations under the ECT since (i) intra-EU investment arbitral tribunals are not \"national courts or tribunals\" in the sense of Article 267 TFEU, which proposition applies to tribunals under the ECT as well; and (ii) there is no complete review of arbitral awards by such tribunals through national courts within the EU, even less so for ICSID arbitrations. This is the case even for ongoing investment cases, since the ECJ\u2019s judgments, unless specifically limited in time, apply *ex tunc.*\n\n86.\n\nFurther, concerning the fact that the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT, the EC submits that (i) the ECJ, in its findings in the ECJ Judgment, intended to carve out only those international courts that are set up by agreements signed by the EU that respect the autonomy of the EU and its legal order; and (ii) the Tribunal has been set up as a result of bilateral commitments between Sweden and Germany, and not as a result of the EU\u2019s participation in the ECT.71\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 26-33; *citing Association Vent De Colere! F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale and Others v. Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9cologie, du D\u00e9veloppement durable, des Transports et du Logement and Ministre de l\u2019\u00c9conomie, des Finances et de l\u2019Industrie*, ECJ Case No. C-262/12, Judgment, 19 December 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 39-43.\n\n87.\n\nRegarding the interaction between the ECT and the EU Treaties, i.e., the TEU and the TFEU, the EC offers two solutions: first, a harmonious interpretation of the ECT in conformity with EU law, or second, in the event of a conflict, the primacy of EU law as *lex posterior.*\n\n88.\n\nWith respect to the harmonious interpretation of the ECT, the EC, in addition to its submission that EU law forms part of relevant rules of international law under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT (see \u00b6 81 above), also puts forth an interpretation on the basis of other means of interpretation under Articles 31 and 32 VCLT. In this regard, the EC relies, *inter alia*, on (i) the definition of \"Contracting Party\" under Article 1(2) ECT, which includes a Regional Economic Integration Organization (\"**REIO**\") such as the EU; (ii) the definition of an REIO in Article 1(3) ECT; and (iii) other provisions relating specifically to an REIO, such as Article 36(7) ECT and Article 1(10) ECT, the latter of which defines the term \"Area\" with respect to an REIO. On this basis, the EC states that the ECT recognises that the relationships between Member States to an REIO and the REIO are governed by the provisions of the agreement establishing the REIO itself. Further, according to the EC, in light of these provisions of the ECT, investments within the REIO are investments within the same Contracting Party, to which the offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT does not apply. In this regard, the EC also criticises the interpretation of Article 26 ECT offered by certain arbitral tribunals for depriving certain provisions of the ECT of their full effect or importance.72\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 47-60; criticizing the interpretations of the tribunals in, *inter alia*, *Charanne v. Spain* (same as **RL-0116**); *RREEF v. Spain* (same as **CL-0160**).\n\n89.\n\nMoreover, the EC derives context to support its interpretation from the Statement made by the European Communities under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT (see \u00b6 54 above), specifically stating that \"[t]he Communities and the Member States will... determine among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings initiated by an Investor of **another** Contracting Party\" (emphasis added by the EC). The use of the term \"another\", according to the EC, restricts the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 ECT to investors from non-EU Member States. Additionally, the context for interpretation of Article 26 ECT is also derived by the EC from the fact that the EU and its Member States negotiated the ECT as one single block, pursuant to the EU law principle of unity in the international representation of the EU.73\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 61-72; *citing European Commission v.

Smrkolj, \"The Use of the 'Disconnection Clause' in International Treaties: What does it tell us about the EC/EU as an Actor in the Sphere of Public International Law?\", Paper presented at the GARNET Conference, \"The EU in International Affairs\", Brussels, 24-26 April 2008; **EC-0008**, R.

Instead a \"special conflict rule\", i.e., the general principle of primacy of EU law, applies with the result that the EU Treaties take absolute precedence over Article 26 ECT.75 The EC also contends that the same result is achieved pursuant to Articles 30 (successive treaties) and 41 (modification of multilateral treaties) VCLT, since either (i) Germany and Sweden\u2019s reaffirmation of Articles 4(3) and 19 TEU and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU after their ratification of the ECT can be construed as an amendment for the purposes of Article 41 VCLT; or (ii) the TEU and TFEU constitute \"later treaties\" on the same subject matter as the ECT, and the ECT applies only to the extent it is compatible with these later treaties. Similarly, Article 16 ECT does not inhibit this conclusion, since it is only a rule of \"interpretation\" and not one of conflict and, in any event is overruled by a later conflict rule in Article 351 TFEU, together with the principle of primacy of EU l aw.76\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 82-85; *relying, inter alia, on European Commission v.

THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered not only the positions of the Parties as summarised in this Decision, but also the numerous detailed arguments made in their written submissions. To the extent that these arguments are not referred to expressly, they have been subsumed into the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither the EC, nor the EU for that matter, is a Party to these proceedings. As such, the Tribunal takes account of the EC\u2019s observations as and when it deems appropriate in the context of the issues raised by the Parties.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal will commence its consideration of the Parties\u2019 submissions by examining Claimants\u2019 challenge to the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection relating to the ECJ Judgment in Section A below. Thereafter, in Section B the Tribunal shall consider the law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of its own jurisdiction. In Section C below, the Tribunal carries out its interpretation of the disputed provisions of the ECT, and in Section D it deals with the issue of any potentially conflicting provisions under international law. Section E addresses the enforceability of this Decision.\n\n**A. TIMELINESS OF RESPONDENT'S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION RELATING TO THE ECJ JUDGMENT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nClaimants challenge the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection under ICSID Rule 41(1) on the ground that the ECJ Judgment cannot be regarded as a \"fact\" within the meaning of that Rule. Further, according to Claimants, in any event, the ECJ Judgment is not the fact on which Respondent\u2019s objection is based, since Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection goes beyond the contents of the ECJ Judgment and argues for extending its relevance to ECT cases.77\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 4.2.1-4.2.14.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimants\u2019 allegations, submitting that the ECJ Judgment creates a \"new procedural situation\". Further, according to Respondent, not raising this objection specifically on a previous occasion cannot estop Respondent from raising the objection now, since Respondent never acquiesced to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in the first place.78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 48-51.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to reproduce ICSID Rule 41, entitled \"Preliminary Objections\", in relevant part (emphasis added):\n\n(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder - unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\n\n(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.79\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the distinction in Article 41(1) ICSID Convention between \"the jurisdiction of the Centre\" and \"the competence of the Tribunal\". Since that distinction is not relevant in the present case, the Tribunal uses the terms \"jurisdiction\" and \"competence\" interchangeably, as the Parties have done in their submissions.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the ECJ Judgment amounts to a new situation that entitled Respondent to raise its jurisdictional objection in its First Submission re the ECJ Judgment dated 4 April 2018. Respondent is not estopped from raising this jurisdictional objection under ICSID Rule 41, for the following reasons.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Claimants\u2019 contention that the ECJ Judgment does not constitute a \"fact\" under ICSID Rule 41(1). What constitutes a \"fact\" under ICSID Rule 41(1) is the very existence of the ECJ Judgment, which was unknown to the Parties prior to the Judgment\u2019s issuance on 6 March 2018. Whether the ECJ Judgment has any legal ramifications for the present case is a separate issue, which the Tribunal shall examine in subsequent Sections. However, the nature of the ECJ Judgment as a legal instrument does not exclude it from being a new \"fact\" for the purposes of ICSID Rule 41(1).\n\n100.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the ECJ Judgment refers to laws that already existed when the Tribunal was constituted does not exclude the Judgment itself from being a \"new\" circumstance.\n\n101.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal disagrees with Claimants\u2019 argument that the ECJ Judgment is not the fact on which Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection is based. Again, the factual existence of the ECJ Judgment came into being only on 6 March 2018, after which Respondent raised its jurisdictional objection at the first opportunity it was provided by the Tribunal. The legal implications of the ECJ Judgment for an arbitration under the ECT, if any, are a separate matter, and shall be examined by the Tribunal below.\n\n102.\n\nThe opportunity to comment upon the ECJ Judgment was afforded to the Parties by the Tribunal immediately after the ECJ Judgment was rendered. As mentioned in \u00b6 15 above, in the ICSID Secretariat\u2019s letter to the Parties on behalf of the Tribunal dated 7 March 2018, the Parties were specifically invited by the Tribunal to comment on \"the implications of the [ECJ] Judgment on our case, if any\". Accordingly, the Parties were specifically invited to comment on whether the ECJ Judgment extends or applies to the present arbitration that is brought under the ECT. Thus, Claimants\u2019 submission that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection goes beyond the contents of the ECJ Judgment by extending its scope to the ECT is not convincing. The Tribunal considers Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection to relate to the ECJ Judgment, without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate determination on the merits of the objection.\n\n103.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection relating to the ECJ Judgment to be a timely one. The objection is based on a new fact, the ECJ Judgment, which was unknown to the Parties prior to 6 March 2018. Respondent raised its jurisdictional objection \"as soon as possible\" after the ECJ Judgment was released and, thus, satisfied the procedure under ICSID Rule 41(1). Consequently, Claimants\u2019 request for Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection relating to the ECJ Judgment to be disregarded pursuant to ICSID Rules 26(3) and 27 is rejected.\n\n104.\n\nGiven that Respondent has made a timely jurisdictional objection, it is no longer strictly necessary to examine the Parties\u2019 submissions concerning the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s power to consider the EC\u2019s submissions on an *ex officio* basis*.* However, the Tribunal notes that in any event, irrespective of the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s objection, the Tribunal considers that it has broad power to examine issues relating to its jurisdiction on an *ex officio* basis. In this respect, ICSID Rule 41(2) is the basis of a tribunal\u2019s power to assess, on \"its own initiative... at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence\".\n\n105.\n\nClaimants have rightly submitted that ICSID Rule 41(2) could apply in a situation where a respondent has not raised a jurisdictional objection, but the tribunal nevertheless considers it appropriate to examine its own competence.80 However, that is not the only situation that ICSID Rule 41(2) applies to. In general, the provision is the repository of an ICSID tribunal\u2019s broad power to consider any issues relating to its jurisdiction on an *ex officio* basis, and at any stage of the proceedings.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Responses to Certain Tribunal Questions, 31 August 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. exercised its power to examine its jurisdiction *ex officio*, even in the absence of a jurisdictional objection by Respondent.\n\n106.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal notes that in respect of the issue of intra-EU investor-State arbitration under the ECT and any implications of EU law, the Tribunal would have\u00a0exercised its power to examine its jurisdiction *ex officio*, even in the absence of a\u00a0jurisdictional objection by Respondent.\n\n107.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal proceeds in the subsequent Sections to make its determinations on the issue of intra-EU investor-State arbitration under the ECT and any implications of EU law, taking into account the Parties\u2019 submissions concerning Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection, together with the EC\u2019s observations, and the Parties\u2019 comments thereon.\n\n**B. APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------\n\n108.\n\nIn order to determine whether the ECJ Judgment has legal implications for this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, as contended by Respondent, the Tribunal must refer back to the source of its jurisdiction. As a first step, it is necessary to decide upon the applicable law when examining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, which is in dispute between the Parties.\n\n109.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls the distinction between the law applicable to the merits of a dispute and the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which notably concerns the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent contends that, by virtue of Article 26(6) ECT and Article 42(1) ICSID Convention, the Tribunal must determine its jurisdiction in accordance with the ECT and \"applicable rules and principles of international law\". In its view, this includes EU law, and the ECJ Judgment itself. Claimants, on the other hand, argue that the stipulation in Article 26(6) only concerns the law applicable to the merits of the dispute. According to Claimants, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is determined only by reference to the ICSID Convention, interpreted in the light of general principles of international law, and the instrument(s) containing the consent to arbitration, i.e., the ECT and the Request for Arbitration.\n\n111.\n\nIn its observations, the EC also takes a view that EU law becomes applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by operation of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, which requires the Tribunal to interpret the ECT taking into account \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\".\n\n112.\n\nTo decide whether EU law is applicable in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction, in the following Sections the Tribunal will first examine Article 26(6) ECT and Article 42(1) ICSID Convention, before turning to Article 26 ECT generally. The Tribunal will then address whether, and if so, how, EU law and the ECJ Judgment form part of the law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, specifically in the context of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.\n\n**1. Article 26(6) ECT and Article 42(1) ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider Respondent\u2019s assertion that EU law and the ECJ Judgment apply under Article 26(6) ECT and Article 42(1) ICSID Convention.\n\n114.\n\nArticle 26(6) ECT provides that \"[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law\" (emphasis added).\n\n115.\n\nTo understand the meaning of \"issues in dispute\", it is important to look at Article 26(1) ECT, which provides insight into a \"dispute\" under the ECT. Article 26(1) ECT states that (emphasis added):\n\nDisputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n116.\n\nThus, as described in Article 26(1) ECT, the \"dispute\" or \"issues in dispute\" in Article 26(6) ECT, or in any other part of Article 26 ECT, are those that concern Part III of the ECT. Part III of the ECT sets out the substantive standards of treatment and protection to which investments are entitled. It does not include the provisions on dispute settlement, which appear in Part V of the ECT. Accordingly, the provision concerning the applicable law set out in Article 26(6) is not relevant to issues concerning the dispute settlement clause in Article 26 ECT.\n\n117.\n\nTo understand Article 26(6) in terms of the ICSID Convention, it is a choice of law under Article 42(1) ICSID Convention. Article 42(1) provides as follows (emphasis added):\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n118.\n\nArticle 42(1) likewise only concerns the law applicable to the merits of a dispute. The phrase \"decide a dispute\" points to the application of those rules of law in order to decide the dispute between the parties, and the ordinary meaning of that phrase (pursuant to Article 31 VCLT) is that it refers to the substantive dispute between the parties.\n\n119.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, a jurisdictional objection is clearly demarcated from the merits of the dispute. When Article 42(1) refers to the applicable law when the Tribunal \"decides a dispute\", it therefore does not include a decision on any jurisdictional objection. The view that Article 42 ICSID Convention addresses the substantive law only, and not questions of jurisdiction or procedure, is also held by Professor Schreuer, whose commentary is relied upon by Claimants.81\n\n**CL-0219**, C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2nd ed. (2009), Article 42.\n\n120.\n\nSince the Parties have made an agreement in Article 26(6) ECT regarding the applicable law, the default rule in the second sentence of Article 42(1) ICSID Convention does not come into operation. This default rule provides that in the absence of the parties\u2019 agreement, the applicable law to the merits will be the domestic law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable. As such, in the present case, domestic law only forms part of the factual matrix of the case, as already determined by the Tribunal in PO 31.82\n\nPO 31, \u00b6 22.\n\n121.\n\nIn conclusion, Article 26(6) ECT, either viewed through Article 42(1) ICSID Convention or interpreted independently of the ICSID Convention, applies only to the merits of a dispute between the Parties. It does not apply to issues or questions relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. For this reason, Respondent\u2019s argument that Article 26(6) brings EU law and the ECJ Judgment into application in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must fail.\n\n122.\n\nSince Article 26(6) is not relevant to the present question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address Claimants\u2019 submission that the phrase \"rules and principles of international law\" in Article 26(6) ECT refers only to customary international law or general principles of international law, to the exclusion of treaties.83\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; 37-38.\n\n**2. Article 26 ECT**\n---------------------\n\n123.\n\nHaving decided that Article 26(6) ECT is of no assistance for the purposes of deciding upon its jurisdiction, in this Section the Tribunal will examine the instruments that it does consider to apply to the assessment of its jurisdiction.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s competence to decide the present dispute is derived from consent of the Parties to arbitrate pursuant to the ECT. In the absence of any choice of law clause for the law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, it follows that questions of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must be answered under the terms of the ECT itself, and in particular Article 26 thereof.\n\n125.\n\nIn order to derive meaning from Article 26 ECT, like all treaties, it must be interpreted in accordance with international law. These are the principles of international law relating to treaty interpretation, application, and other aspects of treaties, which render the ECT workable. They are reflected in the VCLT, and provide the framework through which all treaties are interpreted and applied.\n\n126.\n\nIn the present case, the provisions of the ICSID Convention, and in particular Article 25, also refer to the available arbitration mechanism. However, the terms of the ICSID Convention do not add to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but rather provide its \"outer limits\". The relevance of the ICSID Convention arises because of the investor\u2019s choice under Article 26(4)(a) ECT to arbitrate a dispute against a Contracting Party of the ECT. The investor has four options: arbitration under (i) the ICSID Convention; (ii) the ICSID Additional Facility Rules; (iii) UNCITRAL; and (iv) the Arbitration Institute of the SCC. In the present case, Claimants have opted to submit the dispute for resolution under the ICSID Convention.\n\n127.\n\nIn contrast, in cases where the investor opts for another forum, such as an *ad hoc* UNCITRAL arbitration or arbitration under the SCC Rules, that tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction may be circumscribed by the local arbitration law of the place of arbitration. The ICSID Convention will not be relevant to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in such a case.\n\n128.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal largely agrees with Claimants that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of its jurisdiction is to be made \"under the ICSID Convention, interpreted in the light of general principles of international law, and the instrument(s) containing the consent to arbitration\".84 For the Tribunal, the starting point is Article 26 ECT, setting out the terms of the agreement to arbitrate. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention, which provides for the arbitration mechanism, is not specifically in issue in this case.\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6 7.\n\n129.\n\nTaking into account the conclusion that the ECT, interpreted and applied in accordance with international law, is the law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, in the following Section, the Tribunal will consider whether, and, if so, how, the ECJ Judgment can legally come into play in that analysis.\n\n**3. EU Law and the ECJ Judgment**\n----------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe question remains whether, and, if so, how, EU law and the ECJ Judgment are applicable to the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Respondent argues that since this case involves legal relationships between two EU Member States, the hierarchy of norms to be applied by the Tribunal \"must be determined from the perspective of EU law\".85 According to Respondent, Article 26 must therefore be \"restrictively\" interpreted in accordance with the principle that EU primary law ranks above the ECT.86\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n131.\n\nHowever, Respondent\u2019s position is grounded in a view that Article 26(6) ECT applies to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, which the Tribunal has already dismissed at \u00b6 121 above. Respondent identifies no principle of public international law, or even of EU law, which would permit the Tribunal to interpret the words of the ECT, being its foundational jurisdictional instrument, so as to give priority to external treaties (the TFEU and the TEU), and a court judgment interpreting those treaties.\n\n132.\n\nAs concluded at \u00b6 128 above, the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of its jurisdiction is carried out under the terms of the ECT, interpreted in accordance with principles of international law. As mentioned, the Tribunal understands the principles of international law relevant to the interpretation, application, and other aspects of treaties to be primarily those set out in the VCLT, which has been invoked by all of the Parties in their respective positions.\n\n133.\n\nEvidently, and regardless of whether EU law is understood to be international law, EU law does not constitute principles of international law which may be used to derive meaning from Article 26 ECT, since it is not general law applicable as such to the interpretation and application of the arbitration clause in another treaty such as the ECT.\n\n134.\n\nOne possibility raised by the EC through which EU law could be brought into the interpretive exercise is as \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. In order to test this argument, it is necessary to determine whether EU law is (or more strictly, is a part or source of) international law. Moreover, as a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine the subject matter of the ECJ Judgment, which Respondent and the EU argue should be taken into account by the Tribunal in this case.\n\n135.\n\nIn the following Sections the Tribunal will therefore address (a) the subject matter of the decision made by the ECJ itself, and (b) whether EU law \"is\" international law, before deciding (c) whether EU law should form part of the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Article 26 ECT by virtue of Article 31(3)(c) ECT.\n\n***a. The Subject Matter of the ECJ Judgment***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAs set out at \u00b6 33 above, the ECJ decided that \"Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the [Dutch-Slovak BIT]\".87 The basis for its decision was that the arbitral tribunal under the Dutch-Slovak BIT is not a \"court or tribunal of a Member State\" within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU and thus according to the rules established by the ECJ the arbitral tribunal is not able to refer questions of EU law to the ECJ under the preliminary ruling procedure in that provision.88\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 62.\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 49.\n\n137.\n\nThe ECJ\u2019s concern about whether an arbitral tribunal can refer questions of EU law to the ECJ arose from its conclusion that an arbitral tribunal established under the Dutch-Slovak BIT \"may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law\".89\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 42.\n\n138.\n\nIn light of the above, the ECJ found as follows:\n\nConsequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT... it must be considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.90\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 56.\n\n139.\n\nThis Tribunal considers the ECJ Judgment to be a new development, insofar as it arguably closed the door on the arbitral tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Dutch-Slovak BIT. The ECJ Judgment focused on the \"preclusion\" of the arbitration agreement in that case. Accordingly, the ECJ Judgment\u2019s potential relevance, if any, to these proceedings is to be considered by the Tribunal in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n***b. Whether EU Law is International Law***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn order to answer the question whether EU law constitutes international law, the Tribunal considers it useful to refer to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,91 which is relied upon by Claimants and the EC. This Article, which is an authoritative statement of the sources of international law, provides as follows:\n\nThe Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n\na. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n\nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n\nc. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n\nd. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\n\nStatute of the International Court of Justice (opened for signature 26 July 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945), *cited in* Claimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 15.\n\n141.\n\nThe list of sources of international law in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice includes \"international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognised by the contesting states\". The Tribunal considers it unquestionable that international conventions or international treaties concluded by and between sovereign States constitute international law.\n\n142.\n\nIt is not disputed between the Parties that the TEU and the TFEU are international treaties concluded by and between the Member States of the EU. Respondent categorises the TEU and TFEU as \"agreements under international law\".92 Similarly, Claimants refer to these treaties collectively as the \"EU Treaties\".93\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 36(a).\n\nClaimants\u2019 2016 Observations, \u00b6 10(a).\n\n143.\n\nClaimants object to the classification of EU law as international law on the basis that EU law has been recognised as an \"autonomous\" legal system in relation to both international law and the domestic laws of the Member States, and that the EC and the ECJ subscribe to this recognition.94 Claimants submit that an autonomous legal order, such as EU law, cannot fall within Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, since it does not amount to either customary international law (Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice) or general principles of international law (Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice).95\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 1.3.3-1.3.5; *citing* EC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 10; ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 33; **CL-0150**, P. Craig and G. De B\u00farca, *EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials*, 5th ed. (2011), p. 256; **CL-0151**, J. Weiler and U. Haltern, \"The Autonomy of the Community Legal Order - Through the Looking Glass\", Harvard International Law Journal 37 (1996), p. 411; **CL-0152**, I. Pernice, \"The Treaty of Lisbon: Multilevel Constitutionalism in Action\", WHI-Paper 2/09, p. 4.\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.\n\n144.\n\nThe autonomous nature of EU law, as per the EC\u2019s observations in the EC 2015 Submission, is premised on the constitutional nature of the TEU and the TFEU, in the sense that these treaties form the basis of the organisational structure of the EU.96 The constitutional nature of the TEU and TFEU is also highlighted by the other authorities relied upon by Claimants,97 as well as in the ECJ Judgment.98\n\nEC 2015 Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\n*See* **CL-0151**, J. Weiler and U. Haltern, \"The Autonomy of the Community Legal Order - Through the Looking Glass\", Harvard International Law Journal 37 (1996), p. 411.\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 33.\n\n145.\n\nHowever, this autonomous or constitutional nature of the TEU and the TFEU does not exclude them from the purview of international law. As mentioned in Article 38(1)(a) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, any kind of international convention, \"whether general or particular\", constitutes international law.\n\n146.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the finding of the tribunal in *Electrabel v. Hungary* that \"EU law is international law because it is rooted in international treaties\".99 The EC has correctly pointed out that this fundamental proposition has been undisputed in investment arbitration decisions since *Electrabel v. Hungary.* It would be more exact to say that the corpus of EU law derives from treaties that are themselves a part of, and governed by, international law, and contains other rules that are applicable on the plane of international law, while also containing rules that operate only within the internal legal order of the EU and, at least arguably, are not a part of international law; but for present purposes the *Electrabel* formula suffices.\n\n**RL-0132**, *Electrabel v. Hungary*, \u00b6 4.120; *see also* ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 41 (EU law \"must be regarded... as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States\").\n\n147.\n\nInstead of excluding EU law from the purview of international law, tribunals that have considered the relationship between EU law and the ECT have attempted to resolve conflicts, if any, between them. They have done so, for example, by (i) endorsing a harmonious interpretation,100 (ii) prioritising international law over EU law,101 or (iii) finding that there is no conflict that requires resolution.102 In any event, there is no dispute in investment arbitration decisions, or in the Tribunal\u2019s mind, that EU law, to the extent that it is rooted in the EU Treaties, constitutes international law.\n\n**CL-0160**, *RREEF v. Spain*, \u00b6 77.\n\n**CL-0160**, *RREEF v. Spain*, \u00b6\u00b6 74-76, 87.\n\n**RL-0116**, *Charanne v. Spain*, \u00b6 439.\n\n148.\n\nSince the ECJ is empowered by the EU Treaties to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of EU law, including the EU Treaties (*see* Article 19 TEU and Article 267 TFEU), the Tribunal considers the ECJ Judgment\u2019s interpretation of the EU Treaties likewise to constitute a part of the relevant international law.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it necessary or appropriate to determine whether other aspects of EU law that are not rooted in the EU Treaties also constitute international law. Such a determination is not essential for the purposes of analysing the implications of the ECJ Judgment on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, since only the EU Treaties are at stake in the present case.\n\n150.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that EU law, to the extent of the TEU and the TFEU, including their interpretation by the ECJ, constitutes a part of international law, within the terms of Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n***c. Article 31(3)(c) VCLT***\n------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe EC has argued that EU law forms part of the analysis of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction via Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, as \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\". To the extent that EU law or the ECJ Judgment fall under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, they could become relevant to take into account when interpreting the ECT. In the EC\u2019s view, this would lead to a \"harmonious interpretation\" of the ECT.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the EU Treaties are international law (see \u00b6 150 above). However, for a number of reasons it is not possible to apply Article 31(3)(c) VCLT in the manner sought by the EC.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the correct starting point for the interpretation of Article 26 ECT is the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) VCLT, i.e., \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". Article 31(3)(c) is not the starting point of the interpretation exercise under the VCLT.\n\n154.\n\nTo the extent that EU law may come into the interpretation analysis, as proposed by the EC, it is to be \"taken into account, together with the context\" under Article 31(3)(c). It is not the proper role of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT to rewrite the treaty being interpreted, or to substitute a plain reading of a treaty provision with other rules of international law, external to the treaty being interpreted, which would contradict the ordinary meaning of its terms.\n\n155.\n\nThe EC\u2019s approach is unacceptable as it would potentially allow for different interpretations of the same ECT treaty provision. The Tribunal considers that this would be an incoherent and anomalous result and inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ECT and with the rules of international law on treaty interpretation and application. The preamble of the VCLT emphasises the universal recognition of \"the principles of free consent and of good faith and the *pacta sunt servanda* rule\", also contained in Article 26 VCLT.\n\n156.\n\nWhen States enter into international legal obligations under a multilateral treaty, *pacta sunt servanda* and good faith require that the terms of that treaty have a single consistent meaning. States parties to a multilateral treaty are entitled to assume that the treaty means what it says, and that all States parties will be bound by the same terms. It cannot be the case that the same words in the same treaty provision have a different meaning depending on the independent legal obligations entered into by one State or another, and depending on the parties to a particular dispute. The need for coherence, and for a single unified interpretation of each treaty provision, is reflected in the priority given to the text of the treaty itself over other contextual elements under Article 31 VCLT. The need to maintain a uniform meaning of treaty terms is also clearly reflected in Article 33 of the Vienna Convention, dealing with treaties authenticated in two or more languages.\n\n157.\n\nThat is not to say that all differences in the substantive obligations of ECT Contracting Parties resulting from differences in the range of other relevant treaties to which each Contracting Party has signed up are entirely ironed out by the ECT. The ECT does make provision for variations among the substantive obligations of the Contracting Parties. For example, in ECT Article 10, paragraph 1 identifies the obligations of each Contracting Party towards investors and includes the \"treaty obligations\" of the State and \"any obligations it has entered into with an Investor\", and paragraph 10 identifies obligations under \"the applicable international agreements for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights to which the respective Contracting Parties are parties\". But the crucial point is that while the application of those paragraphs may result in the substantive obligations of one Contracting Party differing from those of another, those paragraphs themselves have a uniform meaning for every ECT Contracting Party. Equally important, there is no similar provision in the ECT for differing obligations in relation to the ECT dispute settlement procedures.\n\n158.\n\nWhile the EC refers to the use of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT as a \"systemic or harmonious interpretation\", the Tribunal finds that the effects of such an interpretation in the manner proposed in the EC submissions would not ensure \"systemic coherence\", but rather its exact opposite. It would create one set of obligations applicable in at least some \"intra-EU\" disputes and another set of different obligations applicable to other disputes. This would bring uncertainty and entail the fragmentation of the meaning and application of treaty provisions and of the obligations of ECT Parties, contrary to the plain and ordinary meaning of the ECT provisions themselves.\n\n159.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has serious difficulty in deriving a \"relevant rule of international law\" from the EU Treaties for present purposes, whether on the basis of the text of the EU Treaties themselves or on the basis of the interpretation of those Treaties contained in the ECJ Judgment.\n\n160.\n\nIn this regard, the ECJ Judgment found that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the [Dutch-Slovak BIT], under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.103\n\nECJ Judgment, \u00b6 60.\n\n161.\n\nIt remains unclear what alleged rule of international law arising from the ECJ Judgment exists and is of application to the present case. The ECJ\u2019s reasoning was not specifically addressed to investor-State dispute settlement under the ECT. While there is a certain breadth to the Court\u2019s wording, addressing provisions \"such as\" the dispute resolution provision of the BIT in that case, it is an open question whether the same considerations necessarily apply to the ECT.\n\n162.\n\nIn particular, the ECT is not an agreement concluded \"between Member States\", as referred to by the ECJ. The ECT is a multilateral treaty, to which the EU itself is a party, alongside its Member States. Unlike the Dutch-Slovak BIT, the ECT is a \"mixed agreement\" between both Member States and third States, in addition to the EU itself. The wording of Article 26 ECT is different to Article 8 of the Dutch-Slovak BIT. In addition, the ECT contains different provisions impacting upon the interpretation of the treaty provisions in their context.\n\n163.\n\nThis issue was recently considered by the arbitral tribunal in *Masdar v. Spain*, which found that the ECJ Judgment did not address, depart from, or reject the Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet dated 19 September 2017 (\"**AG Opinion**\"). The AG Opinion had drawn a distinction between investment protection mechanisms found in bilateral investment treaties and the dispute settlement provisions of the ECT.104 The Tribunal agrees with the conclusion in *Masdar v. Spain* that the ECJ Judgment is silent on the compatibility of intra-EU investor-State dispute settlement under the ECT with EU law.\n\n**CL-0227 / RL-0144**, *Masdar v. Spain*, \u00b6 682; *see also Slowakische Republik v. Achmea BV*, ECJ Case No. C-284/16, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 September 2017, \u00b6 43.\n\n164.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, legal certainty requires that any relevant rule of international law that is taken into account during interpretation be clear. It is not for this Tribunal to extrapolate from the ECJ Judgment and declare a new rule of international law which is not clearly stated therein, or to decide which other scenarios would pose the same EU law concerns as those that the ECJ found in relation to the Dutch-Slovak BIT.\n\n165.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s considerations above, EU law may not be \"taken into account\" under the principles in VCLT Article 31 to interpret Article 26 ECT in the manner sought by the EC \u2014 and in particular, it cannot be used to generate a meaning of Article 26 that departs from the ordinary meaning of the terms of that Article.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Applicable Law**\n-----------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the law applicable to the assessment of its jurisdiction is the ECT, in particular Article 26 thereof, in conjunction with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. These treaties are to be interpreted in accordance with general principles of international law, in particular as set out in the VCLT.\n\n167.\n\nEU law and the ECJ Judgment may not be \"taken into account\" for the purposes of a so-called \"harmonious\" interpretation of Article 26 ECT that would exclude intra-EU investor-State arbitrations. Even if EU law were, *arguendo*, applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, no persuasive case has been made out for applying it so as to yield an interpretation of Article 26 ECT that departs so radically from the ordinary meaning of the terms of that Article as to exclude intra-EU disputes from the scope of Article 26.\n\n168.\n\nIn the following Section, the Tribunal will proceed to interpret Article 26 ECT, which is the disputed provision of its jurisdiction.\n\n**C. INTERPRETATION OF THE ECT**\n--------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Parties fundamentally disagree on the correct interpretation of Article 26 ECT, which is the primary law applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Respondent argues that a restrictive interpretation of Article 26 ECT is necessary, which would exclude the possibility of intra-EU investor-State arbitrations. Claimants contend that no such exclusion exists in the clause. In the following Sections, the Tribunal will interpret Article 26 ECT in accordance with the VCLT.\n\n**1. Ordinary Meaning of \"Contracting Party\" in Article 26 ECT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the meaning of \"Contracting Party\" in Article 26 ECT. In Respondent\u2019s view, Article 26 ECT must be read in a restrictive manner, in line with EU law and the principle of the primacy of EU law.105 Claimant opposes such an interpretation of Article 26, arguing that it would \"invalidate\" Article 26.106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\nClaimants\u2019 2018 Observations, \u00b6 44.\n\n171.\n\nArticle 26 ECT provides, in relevant part (emphasis added):\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) (i)The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n172.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether the references to \"Contracting Party\" in Article 26 ECT can be read as excluding EU Member States in so far as intra-EU ECT arbitrations are concerned. Considering the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 26, the Tribunal finds no basis in the wording for the exclusion sought to be read into the provision by Respondent. Specifically, Article 26(3)(a) mentions that each Contracting Party gives \"its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration... in accordance with the provisions of this Article\". The offer to arbitrate in this provision appears unqualified by any carve-out for intra-EU investor-State arbitrations, and is indeed \"unconditional\".\n\n173.\n\nIn the next Sections, the Tribunal will look beyond the text of Article 26 itself, to consider the meaning to be attributed to the words \"Contracting Party\", in light of their context in the ECT and the object and purpose of the Treaty.\n\n***a. Articles 1(2), 1(3), and 1(10) ECT***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nArticle 1(2) ECT defines \"Contracting Party\" as follows:\n\n\"Contracting Party\" means a state or Regional Economic Integration Organisation which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.\n\n175.\n\nArticle 1(3), in turn, elaborates upon the meaning of a \"Regional Economic Integration Organisation\":\n\n\"Regional Economic Integration Organisation\" means an organisation constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.\n\n176.\n\nIt is undisputed that the EU is an REIO under the ECT, and therefore a Contracting Party to the ECT in its own right (see also the EU Statement at \u00b6 185 below).\n\n177.\n\nReading Article 26 together with Articles 1(2) and 1(3) ECT, the ordinary meaning of \"Contracting Party\" in Article 26 ECT includes both (i) any State that signs and ratifies the ECT; and (ii) the EU (having itself also signed and ratified it).\n\n178.\n\nAccording to the EC, the ECT \"recognizes that the relationships between the Contracting Parties that are member [ *sic* ] of the REIO are governed by the provisions contained in the agreement establishing the REIO.\"107 The EC bases this interpretation upon Articles 1(3) and 1(10) ECT. Article 1(10) ECT provides:\n\n\"Area\" means with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party:\n\n(a) the territory under its sovereignty, it being understood that territory includes land, internal waters and the territorial sea; and\n\n(b) subject to and in accordance with the international law of the sea: the sea, sea-bed and its subsoil with regard to which that Contracting Party exercises sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\n\nWith respect to a Regional Economic Integration Organisation which is a Contracting Party, Area means the Areas of the member states of such Organisation, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organisation.\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 53.\n\n179.\n\nIn light of the provisions of Article 1(3) and 1(10) ECT, the EC argues that the \"Area\" of the EU, in which an investment can be made and a dispute may potentially arise under Article 26 ECT, includes the entirety of the areas of the Member States. Moreover, in the EC\u2019s view, by referring to \"the provisions contained in the agreement establishing\" the REIO, the ECT recognises that the relationships between Contracting Parties that are members of the EU are governed by the provisions of the EU Treaties, including the competence now conferred upon the EU for a common commercial policy and investment protection. It follows, in the EC\u2019s view, that an investment by an investor from one EU Member State in the area of another EU Member State is made within the \"Area\" of the same Contracting Party, i.e., the EU. According to the EC, the EU\u2019s offer to arbitrate is only made to Investors from non-EU Member States.108\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\n180.\n\nThe EC\u2019s proposed interpretation is unsupported by the language of the ECT provisions. The mere mention in Article 1(3) that EU Member States have \"transferred competence over certain matters\" to the EU does not convey that there is no application of the provisions of the ECT between EU Member States. Further, the reference to the \"agreement establishing\" the REIO in Article 1(10) ECT is made only for the purposes of defining the \"Area\" of that REIO.\n\n181.\n\nMoreover, Article 1(10) contains two definitions of \"Area\", neither of which operates to exclude the other. The EU as an REIO has an \"Area\", and States have an \"Area\". Within the EU\u2019s \"Area\", the Contracting Parties being members of the REIO do not cease to have their own Area. This is evident from the provision itself which uses the defined, capitalised term \"Area\" even for Member States of REIOs: an REIO\u2019s Area \"means the Areas of the member states of such Organisation\" (emphasis added).\n\n182.\n\nIf it was intended by Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) ECT that the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 ECT was only made to Investors from non-EU Member States, it would have been necessary to include explicit language to that effect in the Treaty, which is not there. Without such language, in accordance with these provisions, an EU Member State which is a Contracting Party to the ECT may be a respondent State under Article 26 with respect to an Investment in its Area. Equally, the EU as an REIO under the ECT may be a respondent in a dispute regarding an Investment in its Area.\n\n183.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the conclusions reached by other arbitral tribunals. In *Eiser v. Spain*, the tribunal rejected the view that an Investor from one EU Member State has made its Investment in the same \"Area\" as a respondent State which is another EU Member State.109 In *Charanne v. Spain*, the tribunal held that Investments made \"in the territory\" of an EU Member State refers to both \"the territory of a national State as well as the territory of the EU\".110 In *Novenergia v. Spain*, the tribunal found that \"even though the EU itself is a Contracting Party of the ECT, this does not eliminate the EU Member States\u2019 individual standing as respondents under the ECT\".111\n\n**CL-0217**, *Eiser v. Spain*, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195.\n\n**RL-0116**, *Charanne v. Spain*, \u00b6 430.\n\n**CL-0218**, *Novenergia v. Spain*, \u00b6 453.\n\n184.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds no exclusion of intra-EU investor-State arbitration to arise from Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) ECT.\n\n***b. The EU Statement***\n-------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal will also look to an important instrument in giving context to these provisions of the ECT, pursuant to Article 31(2)(b) VCLT.112 The Statement made by the European Communities to the ECT Secretariat pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT (\"**EU Statement**\") is relied upon by Claimants, Respondent and the EC.113 This Statement, in relevant part, provides as follows:\n\nThe European Communities, as Contracting Parties to the Energy Charter Treaty, make the following statement concerning their policies, practices and conditions with regard to disputes between an investor and a Contracting Parties [ *sic* ] and their submission to international arbitration or conciliation:\n\n'[1] The European Communities are a regional economic integration organisation within the meaning of the Energy Charter Treaty. The Communities exercise the competences conferred on them by their Member States through autonomous decision-making and judicial institutions.\n\n[2] The European Communities and their Member States have both concluded the Energy Charter Treaty and are thus internationally responsible for the fulfilment of the obligations contained therein, in accordance with their respective competences.\n\n[3] The Communities and the Member States will, if necessary, determine among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings initiated by an Investor of another Contracting Party. In such case, upon the request of the Investor, the Communities and the Member States concerned will make such determination within a period of 30 days.[footnote 1]\n\n[Footnote 1 text] This is without prejudice to the right of the investor to initiate proceedings against both the Communities and their Member States.\n\n[4] The Court of Justice of the European Communities, as the judicial institution of the Communities, is competent to examine any question relating to the application and interpretation of the constituent treaties and acts adopted thereunder, including international agreements concluded by the Communities, which under certain conditions may be invoked before the Court of Justice.\n\n[5] Any case brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities by an investor of another Contracting Party in application of the forms of action provided by the constituent treaties of the Communities falls under Article 26(2)(a) of the Energy Charter Treaty.[Footnote 2] Given that the Communities\u2019 legal system provides for means of such action, the European Communities have not given their unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation.\n\n[Footnote 2 text] Article 26(2)(a) is also applicable in the case where the Court of Justice of the European Communities may be called upon to examine the application or interpretation of the Energy Charter Treaty on the basis of a request for a preliminary ruling submitted by a court or tribunal of a Member State in accordance with Article 177 of the EC Treaty.\n\n[6] As far as international arbitration is concerned, it should be stated that the provisions of the ICSID Convention do not allow the European Communities to become parties to it. The provisions of the ICSID Additional Facility also do not allow the Communities to make use of them. Any arbitral award against the European Communities will be implemented by the Communities\u2019 institutions, in accordance with their obligation under Article 26(8) of the Energy Charter Treaty.'114\n\nArticle 31(2)(b) VCLT provides: \"The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:.... (b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty\".\n\nArticle 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT provides: \"For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48; Claimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 2.3.5-2.3.7; *citing* Statement submitted by the European Communities to the Secretariat of the Energy Charter pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT, Official Journal of the EU L69/115, 9 March 1998, p. 115 (numbering between square brackets added).\n\n186.\n\nClaimants, Respondent and the EC rely on different parts of the EU Statement to make different submissions. Claimants rely on paragraph [3] of the EU Statement to submit that in the Statement, the EU accepted the possibility of arbitration proceedings under the ECT, even against itself, without making a distinction between investors from EU or non-EU Member States.115 Respondent relies on paragraph [4] of the EU Statement to submit that the \"ultimate power\" of the ECJ \"to issue rulings on [EU] law in intra-EU investor-[S]tate dispute settlement procedures\" was not intended to be withdrawn by the ECT.116 The EC stresses the use of the term \"another\" in the EU Statement\u2019s paragraph [3], which, in the EC\u2019s view, restricts the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 ECT to investors from non-EU Member States.117\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 2.3.5-2.3.7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48.\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n187.\n\nIt would have been a simple matter to draft the ECT so that Article 26 does not apply to disputes between an Investor of one EU Member State and another EU Member State as respondent.118 That was not done; and the Tribunal has been shown no indication in the language of the ECT that any such exclusion was intended. The Tribunal\u2019s responsibility is to interpret and apply the ECT, which defines the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nArticle 28 ECT contains one set of exclusions from the dispute settlement provisions of the ECT. is no language suggesting that EU Member States have \"transferred competence\" to the EU in respect of intra-EU arbitrations, or that such arbitrations are barred.\n\n188.\n\nTaking into account the wording of Article 26 ECT, read together with the above provisions and the EU Statement, the Tribunal cannot agree that intra-EU arbitrations have been carved out from the application of Article 26 ECT. As a Contracting Party to the ECT, the EU has accepted the possibility of arbitration proceedings under Article 26, even against itself, without making a distinction between investors from EU or non-EU Member States. There\u00a0is no language suggesting that EU Member States have \u201ctransferred competence\u201d to the EU\u00a0in respect of intra-EU arbitrations, or that such arbitrations are barred.\n\n189.\n\nTo the contrary, paragraphs [2] and [3] of the EU Statement demonstrate that while the EU and its Member States are recognised as having their \"respective competences\", there is no suggestion that such division of competences has rendered, or could render, EU Member States ineligible to be respondent parties to an arbitration under Article 26 ECT commenced by an Investor of another EU Member State. Paragraph [3] of the EU Statement sets out the procedure by which the EU and its Member States \"will, if necessary, determine among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings\", although no such steps appear to have been taken in the present case. Thus, it is expressly contemplated that either the EU or an EU Member State may be party to an arbitration initiated by an Investor of \"another Contracting Party\". There is no basis to read a qualification that \"another\" Contracting Party only includes non-EU Member States.\n\n190.\n\nRespondent further argues that the EU Statement confirms that \"the ultimate power to issue rulings on [EU] law in intra-EU investor-[S]tate dispute settlement procedures\" remains with the ECJ.119 However, all paragraph [4] of the EU Statement indicates is that the ECJ is \"competent to examine any question\" relating to interpretation of international agreements such as the ECT. It quite rightly claims no exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and apply the ECT.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.\n\n191.\n\nIn paragraph [5] of the Statement, it is clarified that a case brought by an investor before the ECJ \"falls under Article 26(2)(a)\" ECT, i.e., the option for an investor to submit a dispute for resolution \"to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute\". This option is an alternative to the submission of a dispute to arbitration, provided under Article 26(2)(c) and the paragraphs which follow it. As such, it is clear that the competence of the ECJ does not exclude the independent dispute resolution procedure of arbitration, but is one instance of the application of that procedure, provided for in the ECT itself. Nor does the competence of the ECJ trump an investor\u2019s right to choose arbitration against an EU Member State.\n\n***c. Article 16 ECT***\n-----------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal has addressed the foregoing arguments in order to respond to detailed submissions by the Parties, but as a matter of law there is a simpler and clearer route to the answer to the jurisdictional challenge based on the provisions of the EU Treaties. Article 26 ECT and the above-cited provisions must be read in the context of Article 16 ECT, which specifically and explicitly addresses this situation. The plain language of Article 16 speaks against Respondent\u2019s and the EC\u2019s proposed interpretation of the ECT. Article 16 provides as follows:\n\nWhere two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,\n\n(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and\n\n(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,\n\nwhere any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\n\n193.\n\nPursuant to Article 16(2) ECT, the Contracting Parties to the ECT, including the EU, specifically and explicitly agreed that prior or subsequent treaties that they enter into with each other, whose terms concern the subject matter of Part III or V of the ECT, shall not be construed so as to derogate from any provision in Part III (\"Investment Promotion and Protection\", including the substantive protections) or Part V (\"Dispute Settlement\") ECT, where a provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment. Specific mention is made of \"any right to dispute resolution\" under the ECT, leaving no doubt that it is protected by this provision.\n\n194.\n\nOn Respondent\u2019s case, Articles 267 and 344 TFEU prohibit intra-EU ECT arbitrations. This Tribunal does not agree that those provisions \"concern the same subject matter\" as Part III or Part V ECT. However, taking Respondent\u2019s submission at face value and assuming for the sake of argument that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU are understood to \"concern\" investor-State dispute settlement, this would necessarily bring Article 16 ECT into application. The Tribunal also considers that Article 26 ECT, granting the possibility to pursue arbitration, would be understood as \"more favourable to the Investor\", insofar as the EU Treaties are interpreted to prohibit that avenue of dispute resolution.\n\n195.\n\nIn this way, by the terms of Article 16 ECT itself, it would be prohibited for a Contracting Party to construe the EU Treaties so as to derogate from an Investor\u2019s right to dispute resolution under Article 26 ECT, to the extent that they are understood to concern the same subject matter.\n\n196.\n\nWhile the ordinary meaning of Article 26 was already clear, Article 16 confirms beyond doubt that Respondent\u2019s proposed reading of the provisions of the ECT is untenable. In light of this provision it is not possible to \"read into\" Article 26 an interpretation whereby certain investors would be deprived of their right to dispute resolution, whether against an EU Member State or otherwise.\n\n***d. Object and Purpose***\n---------------------------\n\n197.\n\nArticle 2 ECT sets out the \"Purpose of the Treaty\", stating that the \"Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter\". The European Energy Charter, which preceded the ECT, declared that the signatories \"are determined to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and to the flow of investments and technologies by implementing market principles in the field of energy\". Paragraph II(4) of the Charter, which concerns \"Promotion and protection of investments\", states:\n\n[i]n order to promote the international flow of investments, the signatories will at national level provide for a stable, transparent legal framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the relevant international laws and rules on investment and trade.\n\n198.\n\nIn sum, the ECT aims to promote cooperation and the flow of international investment in the energy field to serve the ultimate goal of creating and maintaining a stable and efficient energy market. Granting the right to Investors based in the EU to avail themselves of investor-State dispute resolution is entirely consistent with that goal. On the other hand, depriving EU Investors of the right to invoke the arbitration provision of the ECT, where the respondent State is an EU Member State, would be counterproductive to the flow of international investment in the energy field.\n\n199.\n\nThe EC is of the opinion that the object and purpose of the ECT is rather to \"create an international framework for cooperation in the energy sector between the European Communities, on the one hand, and Russia, the CIS and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, on the other hand\".120\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 69.\n\n200.\n\nHowever, the stated purpose of the ECT under Article 2 is framed generally, and without the geographical distinction argued by the EC. Moreover, even if the EC is correct that this was indeed one purpose behind the Treaty, it does not follow that the ECT was not intended to cover other kinds of investment, as reflected in Article 2.\n\n***e. Disconnection Clause***\n-----------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn support of their argument that intra-EU ECT arbitrations are not barred by the ECT, Claimants rely on the fact that there is no \"disconnection clause\" in the ECT, which in EU treaty practice is included in international agreements in order to ensure that the provisions of a mixed agreement only apply vis-\u00e1-vis third parties and not as between EU Member States.121\n\nClaimants\u2019 2016 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 83-90; *citing* *Charanne v. Spain* (same as **RL-0116**), \u00b6\u00b6 433-438; **Appendix 35**, European Energy Charter Conference Secretariat, Draft Basic Agreement for the European Energy Charter, 12 August 1992, p. 84, Item 27.18; **Appendix 36**, Draft Ministerial Declaration to the Energy Charter Treaty, Versions 2-7, 17 March 1994, Version 7, p. 6; **Appendix 37**, EU External Action Service, Treaties Office, \"Agreements with a Declaration of Competence by the EU\", Document No. EEAS/SG2.\n\n202.\n\nIn light of the ordinary meaning of the words in Article 26 ECT, read together with the other provisions of the ECT, and also taking into account the EU Statement and the object and purpose of the ECT, as discussed above, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the absence of a disconnection clause in the ECT is telling. Article 26 ECT grants Investors from Contracting Parties, without exclusion, a right to dispute settlement, and Article 16 prohibits the terms of another agreement from being construed to derogate from that right to dispute resolution. In these circumstances, if it was intended that intra-EU arbitration would not be available to Investors, it would have been necessary to make such an intention explicit, either in the ECT itself or through the adoption of a supplementary instrument.\n\n203.\n\nAt the time of entering into the ECT, the EU was well aware of the possibility of including a disconnection clause, which would operate as a carve-out to ensure that the provisions of this mixed agreement would not apply between EU Member States. The EU had already included disconnection clauses in treaties prior to the ECT, starting with the 1988 Joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters.122\n\nClaimants\u2019 2016 Observations, **Appendix 34**, Joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Article 27(2).\n\n204.\n\nMoreover, the ECT includes other similar such provisions which limit its application in certain respects. For example, there is a provision for potential conflicts between the Svalbard Treaty and the ECT, excluding the operation of Article 16 in such a scenario.123\n\nFinal Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, Annex 2.\n\n205.\n\nIndeed, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT reveal that during negotiation of the ECT, the EU had proposed the insertion of a disconnection clause. However, that clause was ultimately dropped from the draft treaty.124\n\nClaimants\u2019 2016 Observations, **Appendix 35**, European Energy Charter Conference Secretariat, Draft Basic Agreement for the European Energy Charter, 12 August 1992, p. 84, Item 27.18; **Appendix 36**, Draft Ministerial Declaration to the Energy Charter Treaty, Versions 2-7, 17 March 1994, Version 7, p. 6.\n\n206.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal can only conclude that a disconnection clause was intentionally omitted from the ECT. The absence of such a clause confirms that the ECT was intended to create obligations between Member States of the EU, including in respect of potential investor-State dispute settlement.\n\n**2. Conclusion on Interpretation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nHaving carried out an interpretation under Article 31 VCLT of the ordinary meaning to be attributed to Article 26 ECT, in its context, and in the light of the object and purpose of the ECT, the Tribunal finds that a Contracting Party to the ECT in Article 26 ECT includes EU Member States and non-EU Member States without distinction. There is no carve-out from the ECT\u2019s dispute settlement provisions concerning their applicability to EU Member States *inter se*, in particular regarding the opportunity for an EU Investor to pursue arbitration against an EU Member State. Indeed, the terms of Article 26 ECT give not the slightest hint that any such exclusion is possible.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent\u2019s proposed restrictive interpretation of Article 26 ECT, which is contrary to the plain wording of that provision. The Tribunal emphasises that this interpretation exercise is carried out from the perspective of the ECT, as is required by international law. In reaching its conclusion regarding the meaning of Article 26 ECT, the Tribunal does not deny the existence or effectiveness of EU law. To the extent that the EC or EU Member States saw an incompatibility between EU law and the dispute resolution provisions of the ECT at the time of negotiation of the treaty, or to the extent that they now see such an incompatibility, it was and is incumbent upon them to take the necessary action to remedy that situation. It is not for this Tribunal to redraft the treaty which has been agreed by the Contracting Parties to the ECT.\n\n209.\n\nRespondent further suggests that if the applicability of the ECJ Judgment is not an \"*acte claire*\" for the Tribunal, the Tribunal should request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ regarding the interpretation of Articles 18, 267 and 344 TFEU. Respondent nevertheless indicates that it expects the ECJ to dismiss such a request as inadmissible, since it will not regard this Tribunal as a \"court or tribunal\" within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.125\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.\n\n210.\n\nIn light of the above analysis, the need to consider Respondent\u2019s request regarding a preliminary ruling does not arise.\n\n**D. WHETHER EU LAW PREVAILS UNDER A CONFLICT OF LAWS ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn the previous Section, the Tribunal has rejected Respondent\u2019s assertion that Article 26 ECT should be interpreted so as to exclude intra-EU investor-State arbitration. In this circumstance, Respondent further argues that in any event, EU law prevails over the ECT, by application of the rules of conflict under public international law.126\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 32.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it established that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, as interpreted in the ECJ Judgment, are in conflict with Article 26 ECT. In principle, these provisions do not have the same subject matter or scope. They are capable of operating in their separate spheres without conflict, as has been found by several arbitral tribunals in previous cases.127\n\n**RL-0132**, *Electrabel v. Hungary*, \u00b6 4.146; **RL-0116**, *Charanne v. Spain*, \u00b6 438; **CL-0160**, *RREEF v. Spain*, \u00b6 79; **CL-0217**, *Eiser v. Spain*, \u00b6 199; **CL-0218**, *Novenergia v. Spain*, \u00b6\u00b6 438-442.\n\n213.\n\nWhile the ECJ Judgment has interpreted Articles 267 and 344 TFEU in a way that implies a conflict between those provisions and the intra-EU investor-State arbitration clause in the Dutch-Slovak BIT, and potentially other similar clauses, it did not go so far as to pronounce upon intra-EU investor-State arbitration under the ECT. As mentioned at \u00b6\u00b6 161-164 above, it is not for this Tribunal to assume that the ECJ\u2019s decision in relation to a bilateral investment treaty applies equally to a multilateral treaty with both EU and non-EU parties, under which the EU itself has consented to investor-State arbitration.\n\n214.\n\nIn the absence of a conflict between Article 26 ECT and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to apply the rules of conflict of law so as to resolve any purported conflict between them. In any event, even if the Tribunal had been required to conduct a conflict of law analysis, the Tribunal has difficulty with Respondent\u2019s position that EU law would prevail. In light of the Parties\u2019 extensive submissions on this point, the Tribunal makes the following comments regarding a potential conflict of law analysis, notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s understanding that there is no identity of subject matter and no conflict between the treaties.\n\n215.\n\nThe Parties and the EC have raised a number of potential mechanisms by which they submit that the Tribunal should resolve any alleged conflict between the EU Treaties and the ECT. These are (i) the *lex posterior* rule in Article 30 VCLT; (ii) the rule regarding the modification of multilateral treaties in Article 41(1)(b) VCLT; (iii) Article 351 TFEU as *lex specialis* ; and (iv) Article 16 ECT as *lex specialis*. In effect, the Tribunal is asked to resolve a potential conflict between the different conflict rules.\n\n**1.** ***Lex posterior***\n--------------------------\n\n216.\n\nRespondent argues that pursuant to Article 30(4)(a) VCLT, the EU Treaties prevail over the ECT.128 This *lex posterior* rule provides that where there are two successive treaties relating to the same subject matter, and the two parties to the earlier treaty are also parties to the later treaty, \"the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 32(a).\n\n217.\n\nThere are several difficulties with applying the rule of *lex posterior* to the present case. One is that the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the general rule of *lex posterior* contained in Article 30 VCLT is a subsidiary one. Where a treaty includes specific provisions dealing with its relationship to other treaties, such as appear in Article 16 ECT, the *lex specialis* will prevail.\n\n218.\n\nIn addition, it is by no means clear that the EU Treaties are the \"later treaty\" under Article 30 VCLT. The current Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have existed in substantively similar form since a time prior to the conclusion of the ECT, and have only been renumbered in the successive versions of the EU Treaties.129\n\nArticle 267 TFEU was previously Article 234 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community of 1992 (\"**TEC**\"), and prior to that it was originally Article 177 of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Likewise, Article 344 TFEU was previously Article 292 TEC, and originally Article 219 of the Treaty of Rome.\n\n**2. Modification of the ECT**\n------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nRegarding Article 41(1) VCLT, this provides that \"[t]wo or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if... (b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty\". It is further required that the modification does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights and performance of their obligations, and that the modification in question \"does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole\".\n\n220.\n\nThe EC relies on this provision to assert that the following legal rules and provisions \"could be interpreted\" as a modification of the ECT, on the basis that they \"have been re-affirmed by Germany and Sweden subsequent to the ratification of the ECT\":\n\n[T]he investment protection rules of [EU] law, as well as the principles concerning the competences and the system of judicial protection, including in particular the general principle of autonomy of [EU] law, Articles 4(3) and 19 TEU and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU...130\n\nEC 2018 Submission, \u00b6 88.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. It is unclear what precise modification of the ECT is alleged to have taken place. Moreover, the Tribunal considers that the modification proposed by the EC would be \"prohibited by the treaty\", contrary to Article 41(1)(b) VCLT. Specifically, Article 16 ECT prevents the EU Treaties from being construed so as to derogate from more favourable rights of the Investor in Parts III and V ECT, including the right to dispute resolution.\n\n**3.** ***Lex specialis***\n--------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that *lex specialis* should determine which rule of international law will prevail. However, the Parties have put forward two potential conflict clauses as *lex specialis* in the present case: Article 351 TFEU and Article 16 ECT.\n\n223.\n\nArticle 16 ECT, entitled \"Relation to Other Agreements\", is set out at \u00b6 192 above. It specifically addresses how to construe certain provisions of the ECT, or provisions of other agreements, in circumstances where other international agreements concern the subject matter of Part III or V ECT. The rule is that the ECT may not be construed to derogate from a more favourable provision or right to dispute resolution under another agreement. Likewise, another agreement may not be construed to derogate from a more favourable provision under Part III or V ECT, or any related right to dispute resolution under the ECT.\n\n224.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent and the EC rely on Article 351 TFEU in support of their arguments in favour of EU law. It provides as follows:\n\nThe rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties.\n\nTo the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Treaties, the Member State or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.\n\nIn applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account the fact that the advantages accorded under the Treaties by each Member State form an integral part of the establishment of the Union and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of powers upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all the other Member States.\n\n225.\n\nA plain reading of Article 351 TFEU does not support the outcome sought by Respondent or the EU. Article 351 TFEU relates to agreements between EU Member States and \"third states\", i.e., non-EU Member States. However, the EC and to a certain extent Respondent argue that the Tribunal must apply an *a contrario* reading of Article 351(1) TFEU, which leads to the conclusion that between EU Member States, the rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded with other EU Member States prior to accession are displaced by the EU Treaties.\n\n226.\n\nNotably, this alleged conflict rule is not contained in the wording of Article 351 TFEU itself. It requires a significant amount of interpretation to derive the outcome sought by Respondent and the EC.\n\n227.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the clearer conflict rule in Article 16 ECT must prevail over a rule derived from an *a contrario* interpretation of Article 351 TFEU which cannot be found in the text of the TFEU itself. As a matter of public international law, the Tribunal cannot be asked to leave aside a clear rule in favour of a countertextual one. This is the case irrespective of whether or not EU law is considered to prevail over international treaties within the EU internal legal order.\n\n228.\n\nAs for Article 351(2) TFEU, Respondent argues that this \"confirms\" that the ECT has been superseded by the more recent EU Treaties.131 However, this language merely contains an obligation upon Member States to \"take all appropriate steps to eliminate\" any incompatibilities between the EU Treaties and other agreements entered into with third States. It does not concern intra-EU treaties at all. In addition, it does not support a view that any incompatible provisions become invalid or inapplicable, since Member States must take action to eliminate them.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission re the ECJ Judgment, \u00b6 32(c); Respondent\u2019s 2018 Observations, \u00b6 21.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that Article 16 ECT is *lex specialis* as a conflict of laws rule in the present case. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Article 16 poses an insurmountable obstacle to Respondent\u2019s argument that EU law prevails over the ECT. The application of Article 16 confirms the effectiveness of Article 26 and the Investor\u2019s right to dispute resolution, notwithstanding any less favourable terms under the EU Treaties. If the Contracting Parties to the ECT intended a different result, and in particular if they intended for EU law to prevail over the terms of the ECT for EU Member States, it would have been necessary to include explicit wording to that effect in the Treaty. The need for such a provision is reinforced by the existence of Article 16 ECT, since it points to the opposite result.\n\n**E. ENFORCEABILITY OF THE DECISION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nRespondent has raised the issue of the enforceability of the Tribunal\u2019s decision if it were to uphold jurisdiction in spite of Respondent\u2019s objection. While the Tribunal is mindful of the duty to render an enforceable decision and ultimately an enforceable award, the Tribunal is equally conscious of its duty to perform its mandate granted under the ECT. For all the reasons outlined in previous Sections, this Tribunal is compelled to uphold jurisdiction over Respondent\u2019s objection on the basis of EU law. The enforceability of this decision is a separate matter which does not impinge upon the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n231.\n\nIn respect of Respondent\u2019s allegations relating to the three breaches of EU law, the Tribunal considers it important to clarify that in this Decision, the Tribunal is concerned only with the implications of the ECJ Judgment on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the dispute between Claimants and Respondent. The Tribunal is not concerned with whether Claimants\u2019 actions, either of continuing this arbitration or of seeking an enforcement of an award of compensation, if any, would amount to a breach of EU law. Thus, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary and inappropriate to determine Respondent\u2019s allegations concerning the possible breaches of EU law that Claimants\u2019 actions might result in. The Tribunal considers it equally unnecessary and inappropriate to determine whether such breaches, if any, would be attributable to the home State, i.e., Sweden.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n232.\n\nFOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(i) DECLARES that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection of 4 April 2018 contained in its First Submission re the ECJ Judgment in *Achmea* of 6 March 2018 has been raised in a timely manner;\n\n(ii) REJECTS Respondent\u2019s request for all claims pending before this Tribunal to be dismissed because the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in the light of the ECJ Judgment in *Achmea* of 6 March 2018;\n\n(iii) RESERVES all other issues relating to the jurisdiction, admissibility and merits of these arbitral proceedings for subsequent determination by the Tribunal; and\n\n(iv) RESERVES the decision on costs."}, {"Title": "Recommendation on the Proposal to Disqualify the Tribunal", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2019-03-04T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Recommendation on the Proposal to Disqualify the Tribunal\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present recommendation (the \"**Recommendation**\") concerns the arbitration proceedings commenced in 2012 by 1. Vattenfall AB; 2. Vattenfall GmbH; 3. Vattenfall Europe Nuclear Energy GmbH; 4. Kernkraftwerk Kr\u00fcmmel GmbH & Co. oHG; 5. Kernkraftwerk Brunsb\u00fcttel GmbH & Co. oHG (the \"**Claimants**\"), against the Federal Republic of Germany (the \"**Respondent**\", and together with the Claimants, the \"**Parties**\") under the Energy Charter Treaty of December 17, 1994 (the \"**Treaty**\"). Vattenfall AB is a Swedish company; the remaining claimants are subsidiaries of Vattenfall AB incorporated in Germany.\n\n2.\n\nThese arbitration proceedings are administered by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\") and the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated January 24, 2019 from Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, Legal Counsel at ICSID, I have been asked to provide an recommendation to ICSID on the Respondent's Application for the Disqualification of the Tribunal (the \"**Proposal**\"), submitted on 12 November 2018.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal is based on allegations that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal has \"assisted Claimants with the formulation of their claims and has given them an opportunity to remedy shortcomings at a time when Claimants themselves would not have been able to do so\" (\"**Ground One**\");\n\n(b) The Tribunal treated the Parties unequally (\"**Ground Two**\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent also outlines certain additional facts that are invoked to \"confirm the Tribunal's lacking ability for independent judgment.\" I understand, however, that these additional facts are not themselves proposed as independent grounds for the disqualification of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nBecause of the seriousness of the matters to which the Proposal relates, the reasons on which the present Recommendation is based are set out herein.\n\n**II. Procedural History**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Arbitration Proceedings**\n----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 31 May 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Claimants' request for the institution of arbitration proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal in this arbitration comprises of The Honorable Charles Brower, Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, presiding arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nOn 27 September 2013, the Claimants submitted their *Memorial on the Merits*.\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 August 2014, the Respondent submitted its *Counter-Memorial on the Merits*, a *Memorial on Jurisdiction*, and a request to address objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question.\n\n11.\n\nOn 7 September 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8 in respect of the Respondent's request, joining the objections to jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute.\n\n12.\n\nOn 1 September 2015, the Claimants submitted a *Reply on the Merits* and a *Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction*.\n\n13.\n\nOn 27 April 2016, the Respondent submitted a *Rejoinder on the Merits* and a *Reply on Jurisdiction*.\n\n14.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, the Claimants submitted a *Rejoinder on Jurisdiction*.\n\n15.\n\nFrom 10 to 21 October 2016, the Tribunal held a hearing in respect of the Parties' arguments on jurisdiction, liability, and damages.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, the Parties submitted their *First Post-Hearing Submissions* simultaneously.\n\n17.\n\nOn 14 September 2017, the Parties submitted their *Second Post-Hearing Submissions* simultaneously.\n\n18.\n\nOn 11 December 2017, the ICSID Secretariat, writing on behalf of the Tribunal, advised the Parties that \"the Tribunal is making progress in the drafting and expects to be able to notify its decision in the first quarter of 2018.\"\n\n**B. The Respondent's Requests to Introduction Additional Documents**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 December 2017, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, seeking leave to introduce three additional documents to rebut the Claimants' previous assertions regarding the date on which certain of their nuclear power plants were expected to cease power operations. On 22 December 2017, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's application.\n\n20.\n\nOn 29 December 2017, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's application, reasoning as follows:\n\n5. The Tribunal has considered the Parties' submissions and deliberated. In particular, the Tribunal has analysed the Application under Section 13.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provides:\n\n*Neither Party shall be permitted to submit additional or responsive documents after the dates for the Reply and Rejoinder, save under exceptional circumstances as determined by the Tribunal.*\n\n*13.3.1 Should a Party request leave to file additional or responsive documents, the Party may not annex to its request the documents that it seeks to file.*\n\n*13.3.2 If the Tribunal grants an application for submission of an additional or responsive document after the afore-mentioned dates, the Tribunal shall ensure that the other Party be afforded sufficient opportunity to make its observations concerning such a document.*\n\n6. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that at this very late stage in the proceeding\u2014 more than 14 months after the hearing and three months after the Parties' final written submissions\u2014the standard of \"exceptional circumstances\" set forth in Section 13.3 is a particularly high threshold.\n\n7. In the Tribunal's view, Respondent has not met this threshold. The New Documents relate to a specific point of damages that has been contested by the Parties from the outset of the proceeding. Respondent's damages calculation already reflects its own position on this point (that the Brokdorf nuclear power plant will continue to operate after 2018), and the Claimants' ex-ante damages calculation would not be affected by the introduction of the New Documents. Thus, the New Documents would alter neither Party's proposed damages assessment.\n\n8. In such circumstances, at this late stage in the proceeding, the Tribunal does not see any exceptional circumstances that requires introduction of the New Documents into the record.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, seeking leave to introduce an additional document relating to safety and maintenance at one of the Claimants' nuclear power plants. On 21 February 2018, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's application.\n\n22.\n\nOn 23 February 2018, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's application, reasoning as follows:\n\n7. The Tribunal has considered the Parties' submissions and deliberated. In particular, the Tribunal has analysed the Application under Section 13.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provides:\n\n[...]\n\n8. As stated in Procedural Order No. 34, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the standard of \"exceptional circumstances\" set forth in Section 13.3 is a particularly high threshold at this very late stage in the proceeding.\n\n9. The Tribunal finds that Respondent has not met this threshold. While the Tribunal appreciates that the New Document could not have been submitted with Respondent's Rejoinder, the Tribunal is not willing to admit all new documents at this stage. It appears that any relationship between the New Document and the three issues noted by Respondent is only indirect, and the New Document would neither alter nor establish either Party's position on those issues. In particular, the New Document, which concerns a recent event, does not speak to the conduct of the Parties during the time frame at issue in this case. Therefore, in the Tribunal's view, Respondent has not shown any exceptional circumstance that justifies introduction of the New Document into the record.\n\n23.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, seeking leave to introduce three additional documents that the Respondent considered to rebut the Claimants' assertions regarding the market for electricity production volumes. On 17 May 2018, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's application.\n\n24.\n\nOn 21 May 2018, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's application, reasoning as follows:\n\n7. The Tribunal has considered the Parties' submissions and deliberated. The Tribunal has analysed the Application under Section 13.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provides:\n\n[...]\n\n8. As stated in Procedural Order No. 34, the Tribunal considers that at this very late stage in the proceeding, the standard of \"exceptional circumstances\" set forth in Section 13.3 is a particularly high threshold.\n\n9. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not met this high threshold. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants' assessment that the reasoning set forth in Procedural Order No. 34 applies directly to the current Application.\n\n10. As stated in Procedural Order No. 34:\n\n*Respondent's damages calculation already reflects its own position on this point (that the Brokdorf nuclear power plant will continue to operate after 2018), and the Claimants' ex-ante damages calculation would not be affected by the introduction of the New Documents. Thus, the New Documents would alter neither Party's proposed damages assessment.*\n\n11. Indeed, Respondent accepts in the Application that it \"has always challenged\" Claimants' assertion that certain nuclear power plants will cease power operations in 2019.\n\n12. Respondent challenges the Tribunal's reasoning in Procedural Order No. 34, arguing that the \"very fact that an issue is in dispute between the Parties is what makes it necessary for the Tribunal to consider evidence in the first place\". The Tribunal agrees with this statement in principle, but finds that it does not support Respondent's position in the current circumstances. In the present case, the fundamental issue in dispute between the Parties is the appropriate method of assessing damages, if any: *ex-ante* versus *ex-post*. The New Documents would not speak to this issue.\n\n13. Nor can the Tribunal accept Respondent's argument that the New Documents are relevant to demonstrate Claimant's bad faith and to confirm that Claimants \"have made false submissions of fact to the Tribunal\". None of Claimants' statements cited in the Application amount to false statements made in bad faith. Rather, they reflect Claimants' assessment of the evidence and their support for an *ex-ante* damages calculation. The fact that Respondent disagrees and draws a different conclusion from the evidence is to be expected in a contentious arbitration.\n\n14. In addition, the Tribunal finds that the admission of evidence, even evidence that may have some potential relevance to an issue in dispute, is not without limits. That is the understanding behind Section 13.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, and it is the reason that the standard of \"exceptional circumstances\" set forth therein must be interpreted in light of the phase of the proceeding.\n\n15. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that exceptional circumstances do not exist to justify introduction of the New Documents into the record at this late stage in the proceeding.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Partial Decision on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, posing certain questions.\n\n26.\n\nOn 4 and 23 April 2018, the Parties wrote to the Tribunal regarding its questions of 7 March 2018.\n\n27.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, the Tribunal received a non-disputing party submission from another party, and on 30 May 2018, the Parties provided their written comments on this non-disputing party submission.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, the ICSID Secretariat, writing on behalf of the Tribunal, advised the Parties that \"the Tribunal now expects to be able to issue its ruling in the Fall of this year.\"\n\n29.\n\nOn 31 August 2018, the Tribunal issued a decision on one of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**D. The Tribunal's Request for Further Submissions**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 October 2018, the ICSID Secretariat, writing on behalf of the Tribunal, requested additional submissions from the Parties. The Secretariat's letter provided as follows:\n\nI write on behalf of the Tribunal regarding the Tribunal's assessment of its jurisdiction and alleged damages in these proceedings.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered each Party's submissions and evidence as presented in this matter. However, in the Tribunal's view, the Parties have not sufficiently addressed certain issues which may be relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Third, Fourth and Fifth Claimants, as well as with respect to damages.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's power to judge its own competence (Article 41(1), ICSID Convention), and to consider on its own initiative whether any dispute or claim is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and its own competence (Rule 41(2), ICSID Arbitration Rules), the Tribunal seeks the Parties' views on the following questions:\n\n1. What is the rationale of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with Article 26(7) ECT?\n\n2. What is the meaning of \"foreign\" in \"foreign control\" in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with \"controlled by Investors of another Contracting State\" in Article 26(7) ECT?\n\n3. Is a domestic subsidiary (the Third Claimant) of a locally incorporated company referred to in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with Article 26(7) ECT (the Second Claimant) also to be treated as such a locally incorporated company (the Second Claimant)?\n\n4. Does the same analysis apply to the domestic subsidiaries, being the Fourth and Fifth Claimants, held by the Third Claimant?\n\n5. Or, is or are such domestic subsidiaries (the Third, Fourth and Fifth Claimants) to be treated as part of the Investment made through the locally incorporated company (the Second Claimant)?\n\n6. Is the situation of a domestic subsidiary (the Third, Fourth and Fifth Claimants) of a locally incorporated company (the Second Claimant) referred to in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with Article 26(7) ECT to be distinguished from the situation considered in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v. Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, \u00b6\u00b6 28-38?\n\n7. Having regard to the answers to the above questions, what would be the consequences for each Party's case on jurisdiction and liability?\n\nWith respect to the alleged damages, the Tribunal has the following question (see Respondent's First Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 464):\n\n8. Having also regard to the answers to the above questions, including question 7, and if the Tribunal were to decide that the valuation date for quantification of the alleged damages is 29 June 2011 (corresponding to the date prior to the date of adoption of the 13th Amendment to the German Atomic Energy Act), what would be each Party's case regarding the alleged damages due?\n\nThe Tribunal invites the Parties to provide any comments on the above within 28 days, i.e., by Friday, 23 November 2018. The Parties may reply to the other side's comments within 28 days thereafter, i.e., by Friday, 21 December 2018.\n\nWith their comments, the Parties may submit new legal authorities, but no new factual or expert evidence (including domestic law cases) will be admitted, except in relation to question 8, in response to which the Parties may submit new factual or expert evidence as relevant.\n\n31.\n\nOn 2 November 2018, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to clarify the Tribunal's request, in the follow terms:\n\nClaimants refer to the Arbitral Tribunal's letter dated 26 October 2018, in which it seeks the Parties' views on a number of questions.\n\nClaimants write to ask the Arbitral Tribunal for a confirmation on the scope of the new evidence to be allowed to be submitted in relation to question 8.\n\nIn question 8, the Arbitral Tribunal, referring also to its previous questions, asks, \"if the Tribunal were to decide that the valuation date for quantification of the alleged damages is 29 June 2011 [...] what would be each Party's case regarding the alleged damages due?\" Further on, the Arbitral Tribunal states that, in relation to question 8, \"the Parties may submit new factual or expert evidence as relevant\" (emphasis added).\n\nClaimants ask the Arbitral Tribunal to confirm that any new evidence must be limited to such evidence which is necessary for a Party to adjust its case on quantum in direct response to the Arbitral Tribunal's question in isolation; and that is must not include, for instance, a complete update of the Party's assessment and evidence on quantum, regardless of whether the Party advocates an ex-ante or ex-post assessment.\n\nIn the current situation and in view of the procedural rules, it is submitted that this is the only reasonable approach, given that new evidence is only permitted in \"exceptional circumstances\", a threshold which the Arbitral Tribunal has noted is \"particularly high\" at this extraordinarily late stage of the proceedings. Claimants are already deeply concerned about the very substantial delays of these proceedings. More than two years have passed since the hearing. Apart from the two agreed upon post-hearing submissions, several additional rounds of submissions have been filed; none at the request of Claimants. Claimants have no intention of submitting extensive new evidence in response to the Arbitral Tribunal's questions, and cannot accept that an award risks being delayed even further by Germany doing so.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal wrote to the Parties the same day, inviting the Respondent to provide its comments on the Claimants' communication by 6 November 2018.\n\n33.\n\nOn 5 November 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, stating as follows:\n\nRespondent's counsel will be traveling in the next two weeks. Respondent's main representative will also be out of the office and unavailable. Therefore, we will not be in a position to discuss the reaction to Claimants' email with Respondent and provide comments before 16 November 2018. Respondent therefore requests an extension until 16 November 2018.\n\n34.\n\nOn 6 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, granting the Respondent until 12 November 2018 to provide its comments.\n\n**E. The Disqualification Proposal**\n------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nOn 12 November 2018, the Respondent wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, requesting the disqualification of the Tribunal.\n\n36.\n\nOn 20 November 2018, in accordance with the schedule established by ICSID, the Claimants wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, opposing the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n37.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties, conveying the comments of each member of the Tribunal on the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n38.\n\nOn 11 December 2018, the Parties wrote simultaneously to the ICSID Secretary-General. In these communications the Respondent maintained its Proposal, and the Claimants endorsed the comments provided by the members of the Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nOn 24 January 2019, the ICISD Secretariat, on behalf of the ICSID Secretary-General, wrote to me, enquiring whether I would be willing to make a recommendation on the Respondent's Proposal to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council. According to ICSID, this request to me was made on the basis of a request from the Respondent.\n\n40.\n\nOn 28 January 2019, I responded that I would be willing to provide a recommendation on the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n41.\n\nOn 28 and 30 January and 1 February 2019, the International Bureau of the PCA and the ICSID Secretariat exchanged correspondence regarding the timing and modalities for the provision of this Recommendation.\n\n**III. Observations on the Applicable Law and Timeliness**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Legal Basis for a Disqualification Proposal under the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe legal basis for the Proposal that the Tribunal be disqualified is Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\nA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\n\n43.\n\nIn the Proposal, the Respondent proposes disqualification based on the first sentence of Article 57, *i.e.*, the existence of facts \"indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" According to Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention,\n\nPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent questions neither the high moral character of the members of the Tribunal nor their competence in the field of international law. The Proposal addresses only whether the members of the Tribunal may be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment\". I note that the term \"independent judgment\" also encompasses the concept of impartiality.\n\n45.\n\nRule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\nDisqualification of Arbitrators\n\n(1) A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.\n\n(2) The Secretary-General shall forthwith:\n\n(a) transmit the proposal to the members of the Tribunal and, if it relates to a sole arbitrator or to a majority of the members of the Tribunal, to the Chairman of the Administrative Council; and\n\n(b) notify the other party of the proposal.\n\n(3) The arbitrator to whom the proposal relates may, without delay, furnish explanations to the Tribunal or the Chairman, as the case may be.\n\n(4) Unless the proposal relates to a majority of the members of the Tribunal, the other members shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned. If those members are equally divided, they shall, through the Secretary-General, promptly notify the Chairman of the proposal, of any explanation furnished by the arbitrator concerned and of their failure to reach a decision.\n\n(5) Whenever the Chairman has to decide on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator, he shall use his best efforts to take that decision within 30 days after he has received the proposal.\n\n(6) The proceeding shall be suspended until a decision has been taken on the proposal.\n\n46.\n\nI note that decisions on challenges previously brought in other cases under the ICSID Convention or other procedural frameworks are not binding upon me. However, this does not preclude me from considering such decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that I find that they shed any useful light on the issues arising in relation to this proposal for disqualification.\n\n**B. Burden and Standard of Proof under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nUnder Article 57, the burden is on the challenging party to establish the existence of the required fact or facts and to prove that such fact or facts indicate a \"manifest lack\" of the quality required of an arbitrator, that is, that such an arbitrator lacks the quality of being a person who can be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and impartiality of judgment. The standard of proof required is that the challenging party must prove not only facts indicating the lack of independence, but also that the lack is \"manifest\" or highly probable, not just possible.\n\n48.\n\nI note that the standard imposed by Articles 14 and 57 has been considered in a number of prior decisions. It has been held that \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious\" and relates to \"the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived\".1\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Decision on the Parties' Proposals to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 12 November 2013, para. 61.\n\n49.\n\nThe Parties appear to be largely in agreement with respect to the applicable legal standard.2 I note that both accept the interpretation of Article 57 and 14(1) set out in *Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company v. Federal Republic of Nigeria*, namely that:\n\nArticles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.\n\nThe legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\" As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.3\n\nClaimants' Response, 20 November 2018, p. 3; Respondent's Comments, 11 December 2018, p. 2.\n\n*Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Tribunal, 3 October 2017, paras. 68-69.\n\n50.\n\nIn sum, the applicable legal principles are as follows. Pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, the challenging party carries the burden to establish, first, the existence of facts on the basis of which a \"manifest\" lack of the qualities of an arbitrator can be inferred. Second, the challenging party must establish that such inference is reasonable, considering the circumstances of the case. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention contains an objective standard. Subjective perceptions or beliefs of the challenging party are insufficient to disqualify an arbitrator.\n\n**C. Timeliness of a Proposal**\n-------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nRule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states that a party seeking the disqualification of an arbitrator must do so \"promptly\" after the party has obtained knowledge of the relevant facts on which the challenge is based.\n\n52.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention, nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules specify a precise number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed, and it is well established that the timeliness of a proposal must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.4 I will address the timeliness of the Respondent's Proposal below, in considering the specific grounds for disqualification set out therein.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Tribunal, 3 October 2017, para. 70; *Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 4 February 2014, para. 68.\n\n**IV. Observations on the Grounds on which the Proposal Is Based**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn the following sections, I shall set out my considerations regarding each of the two grounds for the Proposal put forward by the Respondent. I will also address certain additional matters raised by the Respondent that are alleged to relate to the two grounds for the Proposal.\n\n**A. Ground One: Alleged Assistance to the Claimants in the Formulation of their Claims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal's questions to the Parties of 26 October 2018 constituted an \"illicit attempt by the Tribunal to assist the Claimants\" by directing the Claimants to remedy certain defects in their case, identifying how such defects should be remedied, and permitting the Claimants to submit additional evidence and expert testimony at a very late stage in the proceedings, well after the point at which the Parties could themselves make new submissions.5\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 3.\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"all of the questions posed by the Tribunal relate to shortcomings in Claimants' case that Respondent ha[d] raised early on in the proceedings and that were discussed by both Parties in great detail.\"6 These were also, the Respondent emphasizes, issues that the Tribunal had already directed the Parties to address in the questions it provided the Parties in advance of their closing arguments at the end of the October 2016 hearing.7\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 2.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent focuses in particular on the Tribunal's question no. 8, concerning the valuation date, arguing that the Tribunal had improperly invited new factual and expert evidence regarding \"a valuation date for which Claimants have not even presented a claim.\"8 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal may not consider valuation dates other than those submitted by the Claimants. In the Respondent's view: \"because of Claimants' continued refusal to make a claim of damages as of a proper valuation date, the Tribunal has to dismiss Claimants' claims if it comes to the conclusion that the 14 March 2011 valuation date for which Claimants present claims is wrong.\"9\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 3.\n\n57.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal's bias is further shown by the short deadline of 28 days for the Parties to respond to its questions of 26 October 2018. In the Respondent's view \"it is impossible to present a truly proper new expert report with a different valuation date in this arbitration within this short time period.\"10 Accordingly, the Respondent concludes, \"the Tribunal just wanted to elicit a new number from Claimants for their damages case -irrespective of whether it reflects a serious calculation - to overcome the procedural hurdle that it cannot decide in Claimants' favor without Claimants having put the claim forward.\"11 The Respondent also considers that the absence of any provision for an oral hearing on the matters raised in the Tribunal's questions of 26 October 2018 \"curtailed the Respondent's right to a fair trial\" and \"deprives Respondent of its right to confront evidence.\"12\n\nRespondent's Comments of 11 December 2018, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Comments of 11 December 2018, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Comments of 11 December 2018, p. 4.\n\n58.\n\nUltimately, the Respondent concludes:\n\nThe Tribunal has left the role of a neutral assessor of the case presented by the Parties. Instead, it is giving Claimants yet another chance to remedy their defective case and, indeed, it is telling Claimants how to remedy it. Because of this conduct, the members of the Tribunal cannot be relied upon anymore to exercise independent judgment.13\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 6.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants reject the suggestion that the Tribunal has exhibited bias through its questions of 26 October 2018. In the Claimants' view, \"the Arbitral Tribunal has identified certain questions within the existing framework of the case on which it seeks both Parties' comments.\"14 The Claimants consider this to be routine, and note that this has occurred on multiple occasions in the course of the proceedings without objection from the Respondent.15\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 4.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 4.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants consider the Tribunal's questions nos. 1-7 (concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Energy Charter Treaty and ICSID Convention over locally incorporated subsidiaries and the effect on the calculation of damages) separately from the Tribunal's question no. 8 (concerning the valuation date). With respect to questions nos. 1-7, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal's questions go to an issue on which the Parties have taken clearly opposing positions. According to the Claimants, \"[t]here is no suggestion, let alone any request, for any of the Parties to amend its case.\" Accordingly, the Claimants submit that:\n\nthere is no \"defect\" in Claimants' case which the Arbitral Tribunal has \"told Claimants [...] how to remedy\". There are only questions on certain legal aspects of Germany's jurisdictional objection which the Arbitral Tribunal has identified and on which it seeks both Parties' views.16\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 4.\n\n61.\n\nWith respect to question no. 8, Claimants note that they had advocated for an *ex-ante* valuation as of 14 March 2011 whereas the Respondent had argued for an *ex-post* valuation. In its question, the Tribunal raises the possibility of an *ex-ante* valuation with a valuation date proposed by neither Party. In the Claimants' view, \"[g]iving both Parties the opportunity to submit a damages figure based on that valuation date does not show any bias against or in favour of either Party.\"17 In other words, the Claimants argue:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is asking the Parties - both Parties - what the effect on the alleged damages would be if the Arbitral Tribunal were to disagree with Claimants' preferred position - and indeed also with Germany's preferred position - on a particular point of the damages calculation and instead use a valuation date mentioned by Germany in its PostHearing Submission.18\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 5.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 6.\n\n62.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, there is nothing improper with this approach:\n\nThere is also no doubt that an arbitral tribunal can adopt its own reasoning within the framework of the case established by the parties, and that it can - and sometimes must, in order to avoid surprises - invite the parties' comments before adopting an approach on which the parties have not provided submissions.19\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 6.\n\n63.\n\nIndeed, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's proposal \"rests on a misconception\" in suggesting that the Tribunal would exceed its mandate in selecting a valuation date other than that proposed by a Party.20 It is, in the Claimants' view:\n\nstandard practice for an arbitral tribunal to award damages in a different amount than that calculated by the claimant if the arbitral tribunal does not agree with the claimant on a particular point, whether it is a point of jurisdiction, a point of liability, or another assumption on which the damages calculation is based.21\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 7.\n\n64.\n\nAs an initial matter, I note that the first ground for disqualification in the Respondent's proposal was raised in a timely fashion. The Claimants do not suggest otherwise, and I recall that the Respondent's proposal was submitted on 12 November 2018, 17 days after the Tribunal's questions to the Parties of 26 October 2018. I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground, was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n65.\n\nTurning to the content of the Tribunal's questions of 26 October 2018, I agree with the Claimants that the circumstances of questions nos. 1-7 differ from those of question no. 8. While the Respondent concentrates its Proposal on the Tribunal's question no. 8, it also objects to questions nos. 1-7 as allegedly giving the Claimants a further opportunity to submit arguments on points that had already been extensively briefed by the Parties. As I understand the Proposal, the Tribunal's questions are alleged to show a lack of independence and impartiality insofar as they offered the Claimants a further opportunity to develop their submissions, absent which the Tribunal would have found itself compelled to deny jurisdiction over the claims of Vattenfall's locally incorporated subsidiaries.\n\n66.\n\nWhile I understand the Respondent's surprise in receiving a request for further argument on an issue of jurisdiction that, the record indicates, had already been extensively argued, I do not consider it reasonable to make the inference suggested by the Respondent that this was intended to aid the Claimants. The Tribunal's efforts to complete gaps in the evidentiary record and to ascertain the Parties' positions on additional points do not provide a basis for speculation as to a biased motive. Rather, the record shows that the Tribunal remains concerned regarding its jurisdiction over Vattenfall's locally incorporated subsidiaries and does not consider that the submissions and argument it has previously received suffice to enable it to decide the matter. Given that this issue raises a complicated question of the interpretation of the Energy Charter Treaty and ICSID Convention that does not appear to have been examined by any previous tribunal, this is hardly surprising. I do not consider that the Tribunal's request for further submissions, even at a comparatively late date in the proceedings, can reasonably be considered to support an inference that the Tribunal manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n67.\n\nIn the case of the Tribunal's question no. 8, I understand the Respondent's arguments to be two-fold. First, as with questions nos. 1-7, it is suggested that the opportunity to provide further submissions on valuation favors the Claimants, insofar as the Tribunal would otherwise have been forced to deny the claim. Second, it is suggested that, in raising the possibility of another valuation date, the Tribunal exceeded the scope of the Claimants' claim and thus the scope of the Tribunal's own mandate.\n\n68.\n\nIn my view, the former objection fails for the same reasons as that made to question nos. 1-7. The Tribunal's question was directed to both Parties, and I see no basis for the inference that, absent further submissions, the Tribunal was more likely to favor the Respondent's approach or for concluding that a request to consider another valuation date should be seen as more beneficial to one Party than the other.\n\n69.\n\nWith respect to the argument that the Tribunal exceeded its mandate in inviting the Parties to consider an *ex-ante* valuation date other than that proposed by the Claimant, I note that arbitrators routinely propose their own analysis of facts and law to disputing parties, and then allow the parties a fair opportunity to present their views. I thus find no evidence of bias in the invitation to consider another *ex-ante* valuation date. Moreover, the question of the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider such alternative dates is one that ultimately falls to the Tribunal itself to determine in the first instance as a matter of *kompetenz-kompetenz.*\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal thus raises a disagreement with the position the Respondent expects the Tribunal to take regarding its jurisdiction to consider alternative valuation dates. In fact, however, the Tribunal has not yet taken any decision. In this circumstance, the appropriate step is for the Respondent to raise its concerns with the Tribunal itself. If the Respondent ultimately considers the Tribunal's decision on this point to be in manifest excess of its powers, it will retain the option of an application against the award pursuant to Article 51(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Such a substantive disagreement, however, provides no basis for an inference of bias. Accordingly, I do not consider that the Tribunal's request for the Parties to address the implications of an alternative valuation date can reasonably be considered to support an inference that the Tribunal manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n71.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent further objects to the time period for responses to the Tribunal's questions or 26 October 2018 and to the absence of provision for an oral hearing on the implications of an alternative valuation date, I note merely that it remains open to the Respondent to seek a modification of the procedural calendar or to request an oral hearing.\n\n**B. Ground Two: Alleged Unequal Treatment of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal's questions to the Parties of 26 October 2018 \"exhibit severe unequal treatment of the Parties.\"22 According to the Respondent, the questions \"serve[d] one purpose, and one purpose only, and that is to help Claimants overcome the shortcoming in their case.\"23\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 7.\n\n73.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, however, the Tribunal's questions are also part of \"a longer pattern of unequal treatment of the Parties to the detriment of Respondent.\"24 The Respondent points to three occasions in December 2017 and February and May 2018 (set out above) on which the Respondent sought to introduce additional documents and was denied permission to do so. The Respondent notes that, on each occasion, the Tribunal considered \"it too long after the oral hearing and too long after the Parties' final submission to admit even truly new evidence.\"25 The Respondent contrasts this refusal to accept the additional documents it sought to submit with the Tribunal's active invitation for the Parties to provide additional evidence on matters that the Respondent considers favorable to the Claimants.26\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 12; Respondent's Comments of 11 December 2018, pp. 3-4.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent's second ground of challenge is untimely. The Claimants note that the \"decisions denying the applications were issued 318, 262 and 175 days, respectively before Germany filed the present proposal for disqualification.\"27 According to the Claimants, \"these facts cannot now be introduced in support of a proposal for disqualification.\"\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 9.\n\n75.\n\nAlthough the Claimants decline to engage further with what they consider to be an untimely disqualification proposal, they recall that \"the Arbitral Tribunal has decided several other issued relating to the introduction of new evidence in favour of Germany,\" pointing to decisions in August and September 2016 in which the Tribunal denied the Claimants permission to submit additional documents and to a decision in March 2017 in which the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to introduce three new documents.28\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 9.\n\n76.\n\nIn considering the second ground for disqualification set out in the Respondent's Proposal, I note first that the Claimants have objected to this ground as untimely, pointing to the long period that has elapsed since the Tribunal's procedural orders in December 2017 and February and May 2018, denying the Respondent's requests to introduce additional documents. For my part, I do not understand this ground to relate to the Tribunal's decisions on these documents as such. Rather I understand the Respondent's objection to relate to the discrepancy it perceives between the Tribunal denying the Respondent permission to introduce additional documents that it considered favorable to its case and the Tribunal's questions of 26 October 2016, inviting the Parties to introduce additional materials that the Respondent considers favorable to the Claimants. Given this, I consider that the appropriate point from which to evaluate the timeliness of this ground is 26 October 2018. Accordingly, I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground, was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n77.\n\nTurning to the substance of the Respondent's second ground for disqualification, I understand it to rest on the perception that the Tribunal has sought additional documents favorable to the Claimants while taking a firm line in refusing the introduction of additional documents favorable to the Respondent. As set out above with respect to the first ground, however, I do not consider the inference that the Tribunal's questions of 26 October 2018 favored the Claimants to be reasonable. In my view, the record before me indicates only that the Tribunal remains concerned regarding the issues identified in its questions and does not consider the submissions and argument it has previously received to be sufficient.\n\n78.\n\nThe comparison advanced by the Respondent is thus not between documents favorable to the Claimants and documents favorable to the Respondent. It is rather a case in which the Tribunal has sought additional documents and materials that it considered to be essential to its decision and provided reasoned decisions for not admitting other materials. I do not consider that this record can reasonably be considered to support an inference that the Tribunal treated the Parties unequally or manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n**C. Other Matters Raised by the Respondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn addition to the two grounds of the Respondent's disqualification proposal set out above, the Respondent raises two additional matters. Although I understand that these are raised to \"confirm the Tribunal's lacking ability for independent judgment\" rather than as additional grounds for disqualification, I will address them here for the sake of completeness.\n\n***1. The Presiding Arbitrator's Disclosure***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn its Proposal, the Respondent recalls its communication of January 2018 regarding the absence of disclosures by the presiding arbitrator.29\n\nRespondent's Proposal pp. 12-13.\n\n81.\n\nOn 11 January 2018, the Respondent wrote to the ICSID Secretariat regarding public reports of an award issued in an ICC arbitration in respect of \"a dispute concerning the German Nuclear Fuel Tax involving PreussenElektra (formerly E.ON Kernkraft GmbH) and E.ON SE as claimants\".30 The Respondent noted that Professor Bernard Hanotiaou, a partner in the presiding arbitrator's law firm, was reported to be one of the co-arbitrators in the arbitration, that payment of the German Nuclear Fuel Tax is at issue in these proceedings, and that entities involved in the ICC proceedings were the same entities \"for the economic benefit of which Claimants are claiming EUR 1.8 billion in the present ICSID arbitration.\"31 Accordingly, the Respondent argued, \"there is (partial) identity of subject matter, economic beneficiaries and counsel between the two ICC NFT Arbitration [*sic.*] and the present ICSID arbitration.\"32\n\nRespondent's E-mail Communication to the ICSID Secretariat, 11 January 2018.\n\nRespondent's E-mail Communication to the ICSID Secretariat, 11 January 2018.\n\nRespondent's E-mail Communication to the ICSID Secretariat, 11 January 2018.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent argued that \"[b]efore accepting his mandate, Professor Hanotiau should have caused Professor Albert Jan van den Berg to disclose this potential conflict to the Parties of the ICSID arbitration and seek their waivers.\"33 This was not done, and the Respondent observed that \"[f]or the avoidance of doubt, had Respondent been informed of the prospective appointment of Professor Hanotiau, Respondent would not have agreed to any waiver, not even subject to the strictest version of any ethical screen.\"34 The Respondent concluded its communication as follows:\n\nGiven the late stage of the present arbitration and the fact that deliberations have been held, a removal or resignation would not be able to remedy this imbalance. Moreover, a replacement of an arbitrator would necessitate a new hearing giving Claimants (the misconduct of whom has been demonstrated by their behaviour also at the public oral hearing) a second bite at the cherry. It would only increase the burden on Respondent.\n\nRespondent is therefore left with no other choice than to notify its objection under Rule 27 of the Arbitration Rules that the failure to disclose the above mentioned facts gives rise to an annulment ground under Article 52 (1) (a) and (d) of the Convention.35\n\nRespondent's E-mail Communication to the ICSID Secretariat, 11 January 2018.\n\nRespondent's E-mail Communication to the ICSID Secretariat, 11 January 2018.\n\nRespondent's E-mail Communication to the ICSID Secretariat, 11 January 2018.\n\n83.\n\nOn 14 January 2018, the presiding arbitrator wrote to the Parties as follows:\n\n1. Respondent's email was the first time that I became aware that (a) there was an ICC arbitration concerning German Nuclear Fuel Tax involving PreussenElektra (formerly E.ON Kernkraft GmbH) and E.ON SE, and (b) Professor Bernard Hanotiau was one of the arbitrators.\n\n2. Professor Hanotiau and I never exchange information regarding arbitrations in which we are involved as arbitrators because of confidentiality requirements, with the exception of information that is recorded in the case management system of the firm Hanotiau & van den Berg.\n\n3. In the present case, the information entered into the firm's system consisted of the names of the five Claimants and the Respondent as well as the names of counsel and their law firms. The information does not include PreussenElektra, E.ON Kernkraft GmbH, and E.ON SE as they are not listed as a party.\n\n4. Professor Hanotiau's practice is entirely separate from my practice. We do not share associates nor have we or our staff access to each other's cases.\n\n5. Ms. Emily Hay works for 100% in my practice and is not involved in any of Professor's Hanotiau's cases or practice.\n\n6. My partner Niuscha Bassiri is not involved in any of Professor Hanotiau's cases or practice.36\n\nPresiding Arbitrator's \"Observations regarding Respondent's email of 11 January 2018,\" 14 January 2018.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"the relevance of Germany's note is unclear\" and emphasize that the exchange of January 2018 is not raised as a separate ground for disqualification. The Claimants argue that \"to the extent that Germany would seek to re-raise it in support of its present proposal, it has clearly not been raised 'promptly'.\"\n\n85.\n\nWith respect to the substance of the Respondent's objections, the Claimants submit that \"[i]t is sufficient to note that Professor van den Berg was unaware of the commercial arbitration in which Professor Hanotiau was an arbitrator and that the case in any event was initiated after the initiation of the present arbitration and concerned different parties and different issues (a supply agreement dispute).\"37\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 10.\n\n86.\n\nAs noted above, I do not understand the Respondent to have raised its 11 January 2018 objection as an independent ground for disqualification. To the extent that it is so raised, I note that the Proposal was filed on 12 November 2018, 335 days after the Respondent became aware of the matters set out in its 11 January 2018 objection and that the Respondent expressly declined to seek the disqualification of the presiding arbitrator at that time. Any proposal for disqualification in relation to these matters could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not field promptly for the purposes of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n87.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent has raised its 11 January 2018 objection for the purpose of confirming the two grounds for disqualification set out above, I am not convinced that inferences regarding the Tribunal's collective decision to pose the questions of 26 October 2018 to the Parties can reasonably be drawn from the very different circumstances of the presiding arbitrator's disclosures.\n\n***2. Judge Brower's Conduct during the Hearing***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent submits that during the hearing in October 2016, \"Judge Brower left the role of neutral arbitrator and took the position of advocate in Claimants' interest. He conducted lengthy, hostile additional cross-examinations of Respondent's experts when he found Claimants' counsel's cross-examination lacking. He remarked depreciatingly about them as well as Claimants' counsel off the record.\"38\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 15.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent contrasts this with Judge Brower's limited questioning of the Claimants' witnesses and experts and contends that, with the Claimants' witnesses, \"[a]ll of these questions were non-critical, friendly towards the respective expert and phrased in a leading matter that sought to advance Claimants' case.\"39 The Respondent appends an extensive annex of excerpts from the hearing transcript that, it contends, \"illustrate the disparity in treatment by Judge Brower.\"40\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 15.\n\nRespondent's Proposal, p. 15.\n\n90.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent points to criticism of Judge Brower in set aside proceedings in U.S. courts in *Vantage Deepwater Company and Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Petrobras America Inc., Petrobras Venezuela Investments & Services, BV, and Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras,* in which Petrobras complained of similar \"inappropriate conduct\" by Judge Brower.41\n\nRespondent's Proposal, pp. 13-14.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent's assertions regarding Judge Brower are untimely. The Respondent notes that \"[t]he hearing ended on 21 October 2016, which is 752 days before Germany brought its present proposal for disqualification.\"42 The Claimants also consider the Respondent's assertions to be \"not credible\", noting that the Respondent did not raise any objection at the time, despite raising \"numerous objections and applications at the hearing\", including threating to apply to disqualify the presiding arbitrator and seeking to exclude the testimony of Claimants' valuation expert.43 The Claimants also consider the Respondent's assertion to be unsupported by a complete review of the hearing transcript.44\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 11.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 11.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 11.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that post-award criticism by the losing party in an unrelated commercial arbitration is \"irrelevant for the present matter\" and note that \"the losing party [in that case] apparently raised its grievances with the ICDR, which rejected the challenge against Judge Brower.\"45\n\nClaimants' Response, pp. 11-12.\n\n93.\n\nAs noted above, I do not understand the Respondent to have raised its assertions regarding Judge Brower as an independent ground for disqualification. To the extent that it is so raised, I note that the Proposal was filed on 12 November 2018, 752 days after the close of the hearing. Any proposal for disqualification in relation to these matters could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not field promptly for the purposes of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n94.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent has raised its assertions regarding Judge Brower for the purpose of confirming the two grounds for disqualification set out above, I am not convinced that inferences regarding the Tribunal's collective decision to pose the questions of 26 October 2018 to the Parties can reasonably be drawn from the very different circumstances of the Judge Brower's questioning of witnesses and experts during the hearing.\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n95.\n\nIt follows from the legal principles set out above that a party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator must prove the existence of objective facts from which a reasonable third person may infer a manifest lack of the arbitrator's impartiality or independence. Subjective inferences or beliefs are insufficient.\n\n96.\n\nAs set out above, I do not consider that the record before me can reasonably be considered to support an inference that the Tribunal manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" Therefore, I conclude that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proving that any of the three members of the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly lacks any of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in relation to the two grounds on which the Proposal is based.\n\n**VI. Recommendation**\n----------------------\n\n97.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal be rejected."}, {"Title": "Decision of the Acting Chairman of the Administrative Council", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2019-03-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the Acting Chairman of the Administrative Council\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Mesdames and Sirs,\n\nOn November 12, 2018, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Respondent in the abovereferenced case, filed a Proposal to Disqualify the Members of the Tribunal (the \"Proposal\").\n\nThe Proposal was submitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 57 provides that a party may propose the\u00a0disqualification of an arbitrator on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities\u00a0required by Article 14(1).\n\nUnder Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, it falls upon the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide the Proposal.\n\nBy letter of January 22, 2019, the Centre informed the parties of my decision to seek a recommendation on the Proposal from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of\u00a0Arbitration at The Hague.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present recommendation (the \"**Recommendation**\") concerns the arbitration proceedings commenced in 2012 by 1. Vattenfall AB; 2. Vattenfall GmbH; 3. Vattenfall Europe Nuclear Energy GmbH; 4. Kernkraftwerk Kr\u00fcmmel GmbH & Co. oHG; 5. Kernkraftwerk Brunsb\u00fcttel GmbH & Co. oHG (the \"**Claimants**\"), against the Federal Republic of Germany (the \"**Respondent**\", and together with the Claimants, the \"**Parties**\") under the Energy Charter Treaty of December 17, 1994 (the \"**Treaty**\" or the \"**ECT**\"). Vattenfall AB is a Swedish company; the remaining claimants are subsidiaries of Vattenfall AB incorporated in Germany.\n\n2.\n\nThese arbitration proceedings are administered by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\") and the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 8 May 2020 from Ms. Jara M\u00ednguez Almeida, Legal Counsel at ICSID, I have been asked to provide a recommendation to ICSID on the Respondent's Application for the Disqualification of the Tribunal (the \"**Proposal**\"), submitted on 16 April 2020.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal is based on allegations that:\n\n(a) Judge Brower, as a member of the Tribunal, failed to disclose an issue conflict stemming from his 10 October 2014 Concurring and Dissenting Opinion in *The PV Investors v. The Kingdom of Spain* (\"**Judge Brower's Opinion**\"), concerning Article 26(7) of the Treaty (\"**Ground One**\");\n\n(b) The Tribunal engaged in \"illicit deliberations\" by considering the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction in *The PV Investors v. The Kingdom of Spain* and Judge Brower's Opinion, which were unknown to the Parties (\"**Ground Two**\").\n\n(c) The Tribunal decided to hold a hearing on certain quantum matters by videoconference over the objections of the Respondent, which considers an in person hearing to be necessary (\"**Ground Three**\").\n\n(d) The Tribunal maintained an \"impossible procedural calendar\" and refused the Respondent's requests for extensions in light of the challenges posed by the present public health situation of the coronavirus pandemic (\"**Ground Four**\").\n\n5.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent considers that Judge Brower's comments on the Proposal constitute a further ground for disqualification, insofar as he \"left the role of an arbitrator, 'descended into the fray' and abandoned all the distance required for independent judgment\"1 (\"**Ground Five**\").\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal at para. 5.\n\n**II. Procedural History**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Arbitration Proceedings**\n----------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 31 May 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Claimants' request for the institution of arbitration proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal in this arbitration comprises of The Honorable Charles Brower, Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, presiding arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn 27 September 2013, the Claimants submitted their *Memorial on the Merits*.\n\n9.\n\nOn 22 August 2014, the Respondent submitted its *Counter-Memorial on the Merits*, a *Memorial on Jurisdiction*, and a request to address objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question.\n\n10.\n\nOn 7 September 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8 in respect of the Respondent's request, joining the objections to jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute.\n\n11.\n\nOn 1 September 2015, the Claimants submitted a *Reply on the Merits* and a *Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction*.\n\n12.\n\nOn 27 April 2016, the Respondent submitted a *Rejoinder on the Merits* and a *Reply on Jurisdiction*.\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, the Claimants submitted a *Rejoinder on Jurisdiction*.\n\n14.\n\nFrom 10 to 21 October 2016, the Tribunal held a hearing in respect of the Parties' arguments on jurisdiction, liability, and damages.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, the Parties submitted their *First Post-Hearing Submissions* simultaneously.\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 September 2017, the Parties submitted their *Second Post-Hearing Submissions* simultaneously.\n\n17.\n\nOn 11 December 2017, the ICSID Secretariat, writing on behalf of the Tribunal, advised the Parties that \"the Tribunal is making progress in the drafting and expects to be able to notify its decision in the first quarter of 2018.\"\n\n18.\n\nIn December 2017 and February and May 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, seeking leave to introduce certain additional documents into the record, the specifics of which were considered in my Recommendation on the Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify all Members of the Arbitral Tribunal dated 12 November 2018 (see paragraphs 25 to 28 below). The Tribunal denied each of these requests and provided reasons for these decisions.\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, posing certain questions.\n\n20.\n\nOn 4 and 23 April 2018, respectively, the Parties wrote to the Tribunal regarding its questions of 7 March 2018.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, the Tribunal received a non-disputing party submission from another party, and on 30 May 2018, the Parties provided their written comments on this non-disputing party submission.\n\n22.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, the ICSID Secretariat, writing on behalf of the Tribunal, advised the Parties that \"the Tribunal now expects to be able to issue its ruling in the Fall of this year.\"\n\n23.\n\nOn 31 August 2018, the Tribunal issued a decision on one of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Request for Further Submissions**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 26 October 2018, the ICSID Secretariat, writing on behalf of the Tribunal, requested additional submissions from the Parties. The Secretariat's letter provided as follows:\n\nI write on behalf of the Tribunal regarding the Tribunal's assessment of its jurisdiction and alleged damages in these proceedings.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered each Party's submissions and evidence as presented in this matter. However, in the Tribunal's view, the Parties have not sufficiently addressed certain issues which may be relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Third, Fourth and Fifth Claimants, as well as with respect to damages.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's power to judge its own competence (Article 41(1), ICSID Convention), and to consider on its own initiative whether any dispute or claim is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and its own competence (Rule 41(2), ICSID Arbitration Rules), the Tribunal seeks the Parties' views on the following questions:\n\n1. What is the rationale of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with Article 26(7) ECT?\n\n2. What is the meaning of \"foreign\" in \"foreign control\" in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with \"controlled by Investors of another Contracting State\" in Article 26(7) ECT?\n\n3. Is a domestic subsidiary (the Third Claimant) of a locally incorporated company referred to in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with Article 26(7) ECT (the Second Claimant) also to be treated as such a locally incorporated company (the Second Claimant)?\n\n4. Does the same analysis apply to the domestic subsidiaries, being the Fourth and Fifth Claimants, held by the Third Claimant?\n\n5. Or, is or are such domestic subsidiaries (the Third, Fourth and Fifth Claimants) to be treated as part of the Investment made through the locally incorporated company (the Second Claimant)?\n\n6. Is the situation of a domestic subsidiary (the Third, Fourth and Fifth Claimants) of a locally incorporated company (the Second Claimant) referred to in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention read together with Article 26(7) ECT to be distinguished from the situation considered in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v. Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, \u00b6\u00b6 28-38?\n\n7. Having regard to the answers to the above questions, what would be the consequences for each Party's case on jurisdiction and liability?\n\nWith respect to the alleged damages, the Tribunal has the following question (see Respondent's First Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 464):\n\n8. Having also regard to the answers to the above questions, including question\n\n7, and if the Tribunal were to decide that the valuation date for quantification of the alleged damages is 29 June 2011 (corresponding to the date prior to the date of adoption of the 13th Amendment to the German Atomic Energy Act), what would be each Party's case regarding the alleged damages due?\n\nThe Tribunal invites the Parties to provide any comments on the above within 28 days, i.e., by Friday, 23 November 2018. The Parties may reply to the other side's comments within 28 days thereafter, i.e., by Friday, 21 December 2018.\n\nWith their comments, the Parties may submit new legal authorities, but no new factual or expert evidence (including domestic law cases) will be admitted, except in relation to question 8, in response to which the Parties may submit new factual or expert evidence as relevant.\n\n**C. The First Disqualification Proposal**\n------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn 12 November 2018, the Respondent wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, proposing the disqualification of the Tribunal (the \"**First Disqualification Proposal**\"). In its proposal, the Respondent advanced two grounds for the disqualification, namely:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal had \"assisted Claimants with the formulation of their claims and has given them an opportunity to remedy shortcomings at a time when Claimants themselves would not have been able to do so\"; and\n\n(b) that the Tribunal had treated the Parties unequally in its handling of the Respondent's requests to introduce additional documents into the record.\n\n26.\n\nOn 24 January 2019, the ICISD Secretariat, on behalf of the ICSID Secretary-General, wrote to me, enquiring whether I would be willing to provide a recommendation on the First Disqualification Proposal to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council. I responded in the affirmative.\n\n27.\n\nOn 4 March 2019, I provided the ICSID Secretary-General with my reasoned recommendation that the First Disqualification Proposal be rejected. In brief, I noted that I did not consider that the Tribunal's request for further submissions was capable of supporting the inference that the Tribunal had intended to favor one party over the other or could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. I likewise noted that I did not consider that the Tribunal having sought additional documents and materials that it considered relevant while denying the Respondent's request to introduce other materials was capable of supporting the inference that the Tribunal had intended to favor one party over the other or could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\n\n28.\n\nOn 6 March 2019, the Acting Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council determined that \"the Proposal does not meet the standard set forth in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention for the disqualification of an arbitrator\" and rejected it.\n\n**D. Proceedings Subsequent to the First Disqualification Proposal**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn 14 March 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, conveying its view that the Tribunal's Question No. 8 of 26 October 2018 required a complete update of the Parties' valuation models, that the Respondent would require at least six months to respond to an updated valuation from the Claimants, and that the Respondent reserved its right to request an oral hearing on the revised valuation reports.\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 March 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, clarifying its request for further submissions and fixing a calendar for submissions. Pursuant to this calendar, the Parties were accorded additional time for submissions in respect of the Tribunal's Question No. 8, including 105 days for the Respondent to prepare its response to the Claimants' revised valuation.\n\n31.\n\nOn 18 March 2019, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, objecting to, and requesting the amendment of, the briefing schedule fixed by the Tribunal. In the Claimants' view, the adjustment of the valuation date requested by the Tribunal was \"straightforward\" and the Claimants' response to Question No. 8 would be very limited. Accordingly, the Claimants considered the extended period granted to the Respondent to be unwarranted.\n\n32.\n\nOn 21 March 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, objecting to the Claimants' request for a shortened briefing schedule. Instead, the Respondent requested that the briefing schedule be amended to accord the Respondent additional time for its submissions on Questions Nos. 1-7 and for its rejoinder submission on Question No. 8.\n\n33.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, the Claimants provided their submission in respect of all of the Tribunal's Questions Nos. 1-8.\n\n34.\n\nOn 27 March 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, maintaining that the Claimants' provision of its submissions did not alter the Respondent's need for additional time in preparing its submissions.\n\n35.\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the Tribunal adopted a revised procedural calendar, granting the time periods for submissions requested by the Respondent. In the same letter, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate their availability for a hearing in early 2020, should such a request be made.\n\n36.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the Parties both wrote to the Tribunal. The Respondent indicated that it could not be available on the dates proposed by the Tribunal and requested later dates. The Claimants recorded their objection to the timetable adopted by the Tribunal and the amount of time granted to the Respondent, but confirmed their availability on the proposed hearing dates.\n\n37.\n\nOn 19 April 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting the non-availability of counsel on the proposed hearing dates and the need to proceed efficiently and expeditiously and proposing to bifurcate the proceedings between (a) jurisdiction and liability and (b) quantum, with further proceedings on quantum to be determined only in the event of a finding on liability.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 April 2019, the Parties both responded to the Tribunal's proposals. The Claimants agreed to the Tribunal's proposal, noting their view that \"[a] decision on jurisdiction and liability could be rendered without substantial delay\" and that the consent of the Parties to bifurcation was not required under the ICSID Convention. The Respondent objected to the Tribunal's proposal, asserting that issues of liability and quantum were intertwined and questioning the propriety of the Tribunal proposing bifurcation without a request from either party and after already having conducted a hearing in 2016 that included quantum matters.\n\n39.\n\nOn 6 May 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties indicating that it had decided not to bifurcate the proceedings and invited the Parties to indicate their potential availability for a hearing later in 2020.\n\n40.\n\nOn 7 May 2019, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal setting out their objections to the manner in which the proceedings were being conducted and the delay being permitted in the proceedings. Under the circumstances, the Claimants proposed that Germany agree to strike the Claimants' submission on Question No. 8 and that the Tribunal proceed to render a decision on the record before it, without submissions on Question No. 8.\n\n41.\n\nOn 15 May 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, declining to agree to the Claimants' proposal and asserting that because the Claimants had already made their submission on Question No. 8, a full response from the Respondent was unavoidable.\n\n42.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, the Tribunal adopted a procedural calendar envisaging a potential hearing on remaining quantum matters, if requested, during the period of 1-3 June 2020.\n\n43.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal advising it that they had succeeded in selling a portion of their Residual Electricity Production Volumes (a credit under the German Nuclear Phase-Out Law of 2002) that the Claimants had previously calculated as having no value. The Claimants indicated that they would set out the effect of this sale on their damages claim once the transfer had been completed.\n\n44.\n\nOn 3, 12, and 29 July, as well as 6 and 20 August 2019, the Parties exchanged correspondence regarding the circumstances by which this sale came about and the implications for the present proceedings. In the course of these exchanges, the Respondent requested the disclosure of certain documents relating to proceedings in the Hamburg Regional Court.\n\n45.\n\nOn 23 August 2019, the Claimants provided an updated damages claim, reducing the value of their claim by the amount of the sale.\n\n46.\n\nOn 28 August 2019, the Respondent requested a four-week extension of the deadline for its response to Question No. 8, to address the Claimants' updated damages claim. On 3 September 2019, the Claimants opposed this application.\n\n47.\n\nOn 4 September 2019, the Tribunal issued a revised procedural calendar, granting the majority of the extension requested by the Respondent.\n\n48.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 38, granting the Respondent's request for the disclosure of certain of the Claimants' own submissions to the Hamburg Regional Court, directing the Claimants to inform the Tribunal concerning any further settlements for the sale of Residual Electricity Production Volumes, and denying the Respondent's other requests.\n\n49.\n\nIn its order, the Tribunal also noted that the Parties' exchanges had included \"a series of very serious accusations of conspiracy, manipulation of the arbitration proceedings, bad faith conduct, and other activities\". The Tribunal indicated that, should either side wish to maintain such accusations, it should submit a fully particularised submission, accompanied by supporting evidence.\n\n50.\n\nOn 11 September 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it intended to make a submission pursuant to Procedural Order No. 38 on what it considered to be professional misconduct by the Claimants, but requested a six-week extension of the deadline to do so, noting that it would need to consider the documents to be produced pursuant to Order No. 38 and was occupied with preparing its Response to the Tribunal's Question No. 8. At the same time, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reconsider those portions of its Order No. 38 denying the Respondent's other requests.\n\n51.\n\nOn 17 September 2019, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's requests.\n\n52.\n\nOn 24 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 39, granting the Respondent's request for additional time to make a submission on professional misconduct, permitting the Respondent to introduce witness testimony regarding the proceedings before the Hamburg Regional Court, and denying the Respondent's other requests.\n\n53.\n\nOn 23 October 2019, the Respondent submitted its Response to Tribunal's Question No. 8.\n\n54.\n\nOn 31 October 2019, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, indicating that they considered the Respondent's Response to go well beyond the scope of Question No. 8 and that they were preparing an application to strike portions of the Respondent's Response. Accordingly, Claimants sought an extension of the deadline for their second-round submission on Question No. 8.\n\n55.\n\nOn 6 November 2019, the Respondent submitted its Submission pursuant to Procedural Order No. 38.\n\n56.\n\nOn 14 November 2019, the Claimants submitted an application to strike portions of the Respondent's Response to Question No. 8. The Respondent opposed this application on 22 November 2019. On 3 December 2019, the Tribunal issued Order No. 40, denying the Claimants' application.\n\n57.\n\nOn 2 December 2019, the Claimants reiterated their request for additional time to prepare their second-round submission on Question No. 8. Respondent opposed this request on 3 December 2019.\n\n58.\n\nOn 4 December 2019, the Claimants proposed an extended deadline for the submission of their second-round submission on Question No. 8. On 6 December 2019, the Respondent indicated that it would not oppose the Claimants' request, but requested restrictions on the scope of the Claimants' second-round submission. The Respondent also indicated that it would require additional time for the preparation of its Rejoinder on Question No. 8.\n\n59.\n\nOn 13 December 2019, the Tribunal adopted a revised procedural calendar, granting in part the Claimants' requested extension.\n\n60.\n\nOn 20 December 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal revise the deadline for its Rejoinder to Question No. 8, due to the prior commitments of its experts. The Claimants opposed this request.\n\n61.\n\nOn 31 December 2019, the Tribunal granted each side a one week extension on its second-round submission on Question No. 8 and indicated that no further extensions would be granted.\n\n62.\n\nOn 31 January 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal seeking an extension of the timetable for the submission of its Rejoinder to Question No. 8 and a postponement of the reserved hearing dates. The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal reserve additional hearing days. The Respondent opposed all of these' requests on 4 February 2020.\n\n63.\n\nOn 5 February 2020, the Respondent provided its response to the Claimants' Submission pursuant to Procedural Order No. 38.\n\n64.\n\nOn 6 February 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 42, denying the Respondent's requests of 31 January 2020 and setting out its reasons for this decision.\n\n65.\n\nOn 7 February 2020, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to indicate that they had received the proceeds of a further sale of Residual Electricity Production Volumes and proposed to reduce their quantum claim by the amount of the sale as an offset.\n\n66.\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, challenging the circumstances of the Claimants' sale of Residual Electricity Production Volumes and requesting that the Claimants be ordered to produce additional information and documents relating to the sale.\n\n67.\n\nOn 14, 17, 20, and 25 February and 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 12 March 2020, the Tribunal and the Parties exchanged extensive additional correspondence regarding Residual Electricity Production Volumes. On 13 and 25 February 2020, the Claimants submitted offset calculations relating to the sale of Residual Electricity Production Volumes.\n\n**E. The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Public Disclosure of the** ***PV Investors v. Spain*** **Award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nOn 17 March 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting developments in the spread of the novel coronavirus and increasing restrictions on travel and movement. The Tribunal proposed to conduct the June 2020 hearing by videoconference and invited the Parties' views.\n\n69.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, the Parties responded to the Tribunal's proposal. The Claimants agreed to proceed by videoconference hearing; the Respondent opposed the proposal (for reasons set out in relation to the Third Ground for disqualification) and requested that alternative, later hearing dates be identified.\n\n70.\n\nOn 27 March 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal regarding the public disclosure of the 2014 Partial Award on Jurisdiction in *The PV Investors v. Spain* and Judge Brower's Opinion thereto. The Respondent set out a series of questions for Judge Brower regarding the Tribunal's knowledge of or discussions concerning his opinion in *The PV Investors v. Spain*.\n\n71.\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, indicating that the June 2020 hearing would proceed by videoconference and setting out its reasons for this decision.\n\n72.\n\nAlso on 30 March 2020, Judge Brower wrote to the Parties, declining to answer the Respondent's questions in light of the confidentiality of the Tribunal's deliberations.\n\n73.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, reiterating its questions to Judge Brower as questions to the entire Tribunal. The Claimants opposed the Respondent's questions to the Tribunal on 8 April 2020.\n\n74.\n\nOn 7 April 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting additional time for the submission of its Rejoinder to Question No. 8 and the postponement of the June 2020 hearing. As grounds for this request, the Respondent cited the Claimants' reduction of their quantum claim by way of the second and third offsets and the effect of the novel coronavirus in impeding the Respondent's coordination with its client and preparation for the hearing. The Claimants opposed these requests on 10 April 2020.\n\n75.\n\nOn 8 April 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, declining to answer the Respondent's questions, but giving leave for both sides to provide any comments they wished to make in respect of *The PV Investors v. Spain*.\n\n76.\n\nOn 8 April 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting an extension of the deadline given to provide comments regarding the decisions in *The PV Investors v. Spain*.\n\n77.\n\nOn 13 April 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, adjusting the timetable for the Parties to provide comments in respect of *The PV Investors v. Spain* and denying the Respondent's requests for additional time for the submission of its Rejoinder to Question No. 8 and the postponement of the June 2020 hearing.\n\n**F. The Second Disqualification Proposal**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, the Respondent wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, requesting the disqualification of all three members of the Tribunal.\n\n79.\n\nOn 24 April 2020, in accordance with the schedule established by ICSID, the Claimants wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, opposing the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n80.\n\nOn 1 May 2020, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties, conveying the comments of each member of the Tribunal on the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n81.\n\nOn 8 May 2020, the Parties wrote simultaneously to the ICSID Secretary-General. In these communications the Respondent maintained its Proposal, and the Claimants indicated that they had no further comments to provide.\n\n82.\n\nOn 8 May 2020, the ICSID Secretariat, on behalf of the ICSID Secretary-General, wrote to me, enquiring whether I would be willing to make a recommendation on the Respondent's Proposal to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n83.\n\nOn 11 May 2020, I responded that I would be willing to provide a recommendation on the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n84.\n\nOn 12 June 2020, the Respondent wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, taking note of the annulment decision issued on 11 June 2020 in *Eiser v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36) (the \"**Eiser Annulment Decision**\") and requesting that the Parties be afforded the opportunity to comment on the implications of the Eiser Annulment Decision for the present proposal.\n\n85.\n\nOn 15 June 2020, the Claimants wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General, opposing the Respondent's request on the grounds that the Eiser Annulment Decision is not relevant to the Proposal.\n\n86.\n\nOn 16 June 2020, the ICSID Secretariat invited the Parties to make simultaneous submissions on the implications of the Eiser Annulment Decision for the present Proposal. The ICSID Secretariat also requested that I refrain from providing my recommendation until I had received and considered the Parties' further submissions.\n\n87.\n\nOn 22 June 2020, the Parties made simultaneous submissions on the implications of the Eiser Annulment Decision.\n\n**III. Observations on the Applicable Law and Timeliness**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Legal Basis for a Disqualification Proposal under the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe legal basis for the Proposal that the Tribunal be disqualified is Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\nA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\n\n89.\n\nIn the Proposal, the Respondent proposes disqualification based on the first sentence of Article 57, *i.e.*, the existence of facts \"indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" According to Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent questions neither the high moral character of the members of the Tribunal nor their competence in the field of international law. The Proposal addresses only whether the members of the Tribunal may be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment\". I note that the term \"independent judgment\" also encompasses the concept of impartiality.\n\n91.\n\nRule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\nDisqualification of Arbitrators\n\n(1) A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.\n\n(2) The Secretary-General shall forthwith:\n\n(a) transmit the proposal to the members of the Tribunal and, if it relates to a sole arbitrator or to a majority of the members of the Tribunal, to the Chairman of the Administrative Council; and\n\n(b) notify the other party of the proposal.\n\n(3) The arbitrator to whom the proposal relates may, without delay, furnish explanations to the Tribunal or the Chairman, as the case may be.\n\n(4) Unless the proposal relates to a majority of the members of the Tribunal, the other members shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned. If those members are equally divided, they shall, through the Secretary-General, promptly notify the Chairman of the proposal, of any explanation furnished by the arbitrator concerned and of their failure to reach a decision.\n\n(5) Whenever the Chairman has to decide on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator, he shall use his best efforts to take that decision within 30 days after he has received the proposal.\n\n(6) The proceeding shall be suspended until a decision has been taken on the proposal.\n\n92.\n\nI note that decisions on challenges previously brought in other cases under the ICSID Convention or other procedural frameworks are not binding upon me. However, this does not preclude me from considering such decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that I find that they shed light on the issues arising in relation to this proposal for disqualification.\n\n**B. Burden and Standard of Proof under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nUnder Article 57, the burden is on the challenging party to establish the existence of the required facts and to prove that such facts indicate a \"manifest lack\" of the quality required of an arbitrator, that is, that such an arbitrator lacks the quality of being a person who can be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and impartiality of judgment. The standard of proof required is that the challenging party must prove not only facts indicating the lack of independence or impartiality, but also that the lack is \"manifest\" or highly probable, not just possible.\n\n94.\n\nI note that the standard imposed by Articles 14 and 57 has been considered in a number of prior decisions. The Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council has stated that \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious\" and relates to \"the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived\".2 Proof of actual bias is not required; rather, \"it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.\"3 Finally, the legal standard applicable to disqualification is an objective one, and \"the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.\"4\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Decision on the Parties' Proposals to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 12 November 2013, para. 61 (**Respondent's Attachment 107**).\n\n*Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Tribunal, 3 October 2017, para. 68 (**Respondent's Attachment 112**).\n\n*Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Tribunal, 3 October 2017, para. 69 (**Respondent's Attachment 112**).\n\n95.\n\nAs summarized in my Recommendation on the First Disqualification Proposal, the applicable legal principles are as follows. Pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, the challenging party carries the burden to establish, first, the existence of facts on the basis of which a \"manifest\" lack of the qualities of an arbitrator can be inferred. Second, the challenging party must establish that such inference is reasonable, considering the circumstances of the case. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention contains an objective standard. Subjective perceptions or beliefs of the challenging party are insufficient to disqualify an arbitrator.\n\n**C. Relationship between Disclosure and Independence and Impartiality**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) requires that prospective arbitrators make the following declaration:\n\nTo the best of my knowledge there is no reason why I should not serve on the Arbitral Tribunal constituted by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes with respect to a dispute between \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_and\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nI shall keep confidential all information coming to my knowledge as a result of my participation in this proceeding, as well as the contents of any award made by the Tribunal.\n\nI shall judge fairly as between the parties, according to the applicable law, and shall not accept any instruction or compensation with regard to the proceeding from any source except as provided in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and in the Regulations and Rules made pursuant thereto.\n\nAttached is a statement of (a) my past and present professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties and (b) any other circumstance that might cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party. I acknowledge that by signing this declaration, I assume a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship or circumstance that subsequently arises during this proceeding.\n\n97.\n\nThe scope of this obligation has been considered in a number of prior decisions. In particular, it is clear that the standard for disclosure under Rule 6(2) is not the same as the standard for removal under Articles 57 and 14(1). The standard for disclosure under Rule 6(2) has been equated with the standard of \"likely to give rise to justifiable doubts\"; disqualification, however, requires a \"manifest lack\" of the qualities required of an arbitrator. As such, \"non\u2010disclosure would itself indicate manifest lack of impartiality only if the facts or circumstances surrounding such non\u2010disclosure are of such gravity (whether alone or in combination with other factors) as to call into question the ability of the arbitrator to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\"5\n\n*Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment Srl, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., Twenty Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine, L.L.C., Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision On Claimants' Proposal To Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator, 23 December 2010, para. 40 (**Respondent's Attachment 135**).\n\n**D. Timeliness of a Proposal**\n-------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nRule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states that a party seeking the disqualification of an arbitrator must do so \"promptly\" after the party has obtained knowledge of the relevant facts on which the challenge is based.\n\n99.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention, nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules specify a precise number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed, and it is well established that the timeliness of a proposal must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.6 I will address the timeliness of the Respondent's Proposal below, in considering the specific grounds for disqualification set out therein.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Tribunal, 3 October 2017, para. 70 (**Respondent's Attachment 112**); *Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 4 February 2014, para. 68 (**Respondent's Attachment 116**).\n\n**IV. Observations on the Grounds on which the Proposal Is Based**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIn the following sections, I shall set out my considerations regarding each of the five grounds for the Proposal put forward by the Respondent.\n\n**A. Ground One: Non-Disclosure of Judge Brower's Opinion in** ***The PV Investors v. Spain***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Judge Brower \"failed to disclose for almost six (6) years that he had an issue conflict and, indeed, had already delivered his opinion on the very matter that is also at the heart of this arbitration, i.e. Article 26(7) ECT.\"7 The Respondent notes that it became aware of Judge Brower's 2014 Opinion in *The PV Investors v. Spain* only in March 2020.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 66.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Judge Brower's Opinion deals with matters \"on which Respondent had the right to be informed and to receive the opportunity to make contrary submissions from the outset.\"8 In particular, the Respondent notes Judge Brower's assertion that, under the Treaty, investors must have equal access to arbitration, irrespective of the form of arbitration taken. In the Respondent's view \"[i]n the present arbitration, the differences in outcome between ICSID and Non-ICSID arbitration under Article 26 ECT are of pivotal importance.\" According to the Respondent, however, whereas Judge Brower interpreted the Treaty in *The PV Investors v. Spain* as according rights to domestic investors in all forms of arbitration, the Respondent submits that domestic investors are never granted such rights.9\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 79.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Judge Brower's \"disclosure duty does not only cover aspects that do give rise to disqualification grounds under Article 14 ICSID Convention. The declaration covers every aspect 'that might cause [\u2026] independent judgment to be questioned by a party.' Hence, already the potential suffices.\"10 According to the Respondent, this understanding is reinforced in the recent annulment committee decision in *Eiser v. Kingdom of Spain*,11 which held that disclosure \"must be approached from the point of view of a party\"12 and that the lack of disclosure in that matter \"created a 'manifest appearance of bias'\".13\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 137.\n\n*Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Engerg\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/36/36, Decision on the Kingdom of Spain's Application for Annulment, 11 June 2020.\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Eiser Annulment, para. 27.\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Eiser Annulment, para. 33.\n\n104.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent contends that \"[t]he *PV Investors* concerns multiple aspects that indeed would have and now do cause Respondent to question Judge Brower's reliability for independent judgment.\"14 Specifically, the Respondent notes:\n\nJudge Brower has openly presumed that Article 26(7) ECT would permit self-standing claims of domestic subsidiaries, not only in ICSID proceedings, but also in UNCITRAL/SCC arbitrations. That is, he has pre-judged a matter at the heart of this arbitration's jurisdictional problem, namely whether Vattenfall's domestic subsidiaries can bring their full losses, comprising E.ON's shares.15\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 141.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 141.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"Judge Brower's Dissent lacks relevance\" because it concerned a question not at issue in the present proceedings.16*The PV Investors v. Spain* concerned the rights of locally incorporated companies in proceedings under the UNCITRAL Rules, not pursuant to the ICSID Convention.17\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 22.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 22\n\n106.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants argue that, even if Judge Brower's Opinion were relevant, it would not amount to a manifest lack of impartiality. The Claimants consider it \"well-settled that the expression of an opinion on an issue relevant in a particular arbitration is not tantamount to bias or impartiality, irrespective of whether it is expressed in an academic article, or through a decision in an arbitration.\"18\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 23.\n\n107.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that \"Judge Brower was under no obligation to disclose neither the Majority Decision, nor his Dissent\" in *The PV Investors v. Spain*.19 The Claimants cite the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration and submit that, for the ICSID Rules, Judge Brower's circumstances \"are not such that they would prompt disclosure since they do not, in the words of the unchallenged members of the arbitral tribunal in *Suez v. Argentina*, 'reasonably cause [the arbitrator's] reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a reasonable person.'\"20\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para 25.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 25, *quoting* *Suez v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/17, Decision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, 12 May 2008, para. 46 (**Respondent's Attachment 181**).\n\n108.\n\nIn his comments, Judge Brower submits that there was no issue conflict as his Opinion in *The PV Investors v. Spain* did not address an issue in dispute in the present proceedings. According to Judge Brower, his Opinion addressed only whether \"Article 26(7) of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) should have been interpreted to accord to claimants proceeding under the UNCITRAL Rules and those of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC) the same treatment as that Article accords to claimants proceeding under the ICSID Convention and its Article 25(2)(b).\"21 However, Judge Brower contends, \"[i]t took no position as to the consequences of a proper application of that Article 25(2)(b) in any case, including the present one.\"22\n\nResponse of Judge Brower to Challenge of 17 April 2020, para. 2.\n\nResponse of Judge Brower to Challenge of 17 April 2020, para. 2.\n\n109.\n\nJudge Brower further submits that he was under no obligation to disclose his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion. Judge Brower recalls the classification of previously expressed legal opinions in the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration and notes that his Opinion was not focussed on this case.23\n\nResponse of Judge Brower to Challenge of 17 April 2020, para. 9.\n\n110.\n\nAs an initial matter, I note that the first ground for disqualification in the Respondent's Proposal was raised in a timely fashion. The Respondent's Proposal was submitted on 16 April 2020, 20 days after I understand the Respondent to have obtained a copy of Judge Brower's Opinion on 27 March 2020. I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground, was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n111.\n\nTurning to the substance of the Respondent's proposal, I note that, although presented as a question of disclosure, the Respondent's first ground for disqualification is premised on the assumption that Judge Brower's Opinion in *The PV Investors v. Spain* constitutes an issue conflict with respect to the present proceedings. This starting assumption, however, is contested by both the Claimants and Judge Brower. Because the question of whether Judge Brower's Opinion constituted an issue conflict bears on his disclosure obligations and on whether any failure of disclosure suffices to establish a manifest lack of the qualities required of an arbitrator, I consider it essential to examine whether Judge Brower's Opinion gives rise to such conflict.\n\n112.\n\nIn international arbitral proceedings, an \"issue conflict\" denotes a situation in which an arbitrator is inappropriately predisposed to favor a particular outcome with respect to the issues at stake in the proceedings. As described in *CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd. et al. v. India*, the leading decision on this question relied upon by the Respondent, an issue conflict is \"based on a concern that an arbitrator will not approach an issue impartially, but rather with a desire to conform to his or her own previously expressed view.\"24 This concern must be parsed carefully, however, and cannot mean that an arbitrator that has previously ruled on an issue or applied a treaty in another matter is thereby automatically conflicted with respect to that issue or that treaty. Arbitrators are expected to be knowledgeable of the law and to have potentially extensive prior experience in the resolution of disputes within his or her area of specialization. As such, \"knowledge of the law or views expressed about the law are not *per se* sources of conflict that require removal of an arbitrator.\"25 Nor does \"a prior decision in a common area of law\" suffice to \"automatically support a view that an arbitrator may lack impartiality.\"26 Instead, an issue conflict requires (a) \"an appearance of pre-judgment of an issue likely to be relevant to the dispute\" and (b) \"on which the parties have a reasonable expectation of an open mind.\"27\n\n*CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd., Devas Employees Mauritius Private Limited, and Telcom Devas Mauritius Limited v.

Article 26(7) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\nAn Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State\".\n\nIn other words, Article 26(7) provides that a controlled local subsidiary of a foreign investor will meet the nationality requirement of the ICSID Convention, which requires the agreement of the parties before such a subsidiary can be considered a party to a dispute falling with the jurisdiction of the Centre. However, nothing in the Treaty directly addresses the status of a controlled local subsidiary of a foreign investor for the purposes of the Treaty itself (as opposed to the purposes of the ICSID Convention). Instead, the text of Article 26(1) of the Treaty provides for dispute resolution only for \"[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party\" and the text of the definition of \"Investor\" does not include controlled local subsidiaries. In short, the Treaty appears to provide for the treatment of controlled local subsidiaries in ICSID Convention proceedings, without providing a clear textual avenue for how and under what circumstances such controlled local subsidiaries may access the ICSID Convention.\n\n114.\n\nThe jurisdictional issue in *The PV Investors v. Spain* concerned the right of local Spanish subsidiaries to bring claims as claimants in proceedings initiated pursuant to the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules. The majority of that tribunal ruled that this was not permitted, as Article 26(7) only provided for the treatment of controlled local subsidiaries under the ICSID Convention. Judge Brower disagreed, giving rise to the Opinion at issue in this disqualification Proposal. At no point, however, did anyone in the *PV Investors* proceedings appear to have questioned whether local Spanish subsidiaries would have been entitled to stand as claimants had those arbitral proceedings been brought under the ICSID Convention.\n\n115.\n\nThe jurisdictional issue in the present proceedings concerns whether Vattenfall's German incorporated subsidiaries are entitled to stand as Claimants in their own right and bring claims in respect of their full alleged losses, including alleged losses in excess of Vattenfall AB's percentage interest in these subsidiaries. The Respondent in these proceedings argues that Article 26(7) of the Treaty provides for \"procedural standing\" only and that such local subsidiaries \"would only be entitled to recover alleged damages attributable to the share of the controlling foreign entity.\"28\n\nThe Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 593.\n\n116.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I do not consider that any issue conflict arises. The question of jurisdiction at issue in *The PV Investors v. Spain* is fundamentally different from that at issue in these proceedings. I note that Judge Brower's Opinion was premised on the assumption that controlled local subsidiaries would be entitled to stand as claimants in proceedings under the ICSID Convention, but do not see that he decided that issue or decided the scope of rights available to such local subsidiaries. On the contrary, Judge Brower's assumption appears to have been shared by the other members of the *PV Investors* tribunal29 and by all of the parties in those proceedings,30 none of whom appear to have argued otherwise. Moreover, the view that controlled local subsidiaries would have access, in some form, to the ICSID Convention also appears to be shared\u2014albeit subject to a caveat\u2014by the Respondent in the present proceedings, which \"does not dispute that, in theory, locally incorporated operating companies can have procedural standing (not substantive rights) under the ECT and the ICSID Convention if they show that they are controlled by a foreign investor.\"31\n\n*The PV Investors v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, 13 October 2014, paras. 261, 267 (**Respondent's Attachment 95**).\n\n*The PV Investors v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, 13 October 2014, paras. 242, 245, 247 (**Respondent's Attachment 95**).\n\nThe Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 724.\n\n117.\n\nAs I understand the Respondent's view of the relevance of Judge Brower's Opinion, by indicating that he considered controlled local subsidiaries to be \"investors\" for the purposes of the Treaty, he must necessarily have decided that such subsidiaries could bring claims for the full amount of their alleged losses, and not only for the share of their losses corresponding to the interest of the controlling foreign parent.32 I do not, however, find sufficient reasons to draw this inference. No one in *The PV Investors v. Spain* appears to have suggested, as the Respondent now does, that controlled local subsidiaries could be parties in proceedings under the ICSID Convention, yet at the same time limited in the claims they could bring to those corresponding to the interest of their foreign parent. The parties and tribunal in *The PV Investors v. Spain* do not appear to have engaged with the distinction between substantive rights and procedural standing that the Respondent advances in the present proceedings. This appears to be a novel argument, and I take no view of any kind on its merits or demerits. That point not having been raised or argued in *The PV Investors v. Spain*, however, I do not see reasons to infer that Judge Brower's Opinion expressed any firm view on the matter. I also take note of Judge Brower's assertion that his Opinion took no position on this question. As such, I see no basis to infer either that he has pre-judged an issue in the present proceedings or that he lacks an open mind in considering the Respondent's jurisdictional arguments.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 101-103.\n\n118.\n\nTurning to the question of disclosure that forms the core of the Respondent's first ground for disqualification, I accordingly do not consider this to be a matter of a wrongful non-disclosure by Judge Brower of an issue conflict. The question is rather whether Judge Brower was under an obligation to disclose that he had considered and rendered an opinion on another aspect of Article 26(7) of the Treaty in unrelated proceedings. Given that Judge Brower's Opinion did not take a position on issues in dispute in the present proceedings, I do not consider that it would reasonably give rise to justifiable doubt as to his impartiality, such as to require disclosure under Rule 6(2). In any event, I do not see that his non-disclosure of the Opinion can support an inference that Judge Brower manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment\".\n\n**B. Ground Two: The \"Illicit Deliberations\" of the Tribunal concerning** ***The PV Investors v. Spain***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal, \"for years, has been deliberating about matters unknown to the Respondent and therefore restricted the Respondent's defense possibilities.\"33 The Respondent argues that the Tribunal and Judge Brower's refusal to answer its questions regarding whether, and if so when, the Tribunal had discussed Judge Brower's Opinion, \"constitute *prima facie* evidence for the appearance that the Tribunal has been deliberating for years about *The PV Investors* without disclosing this matter to the Parties.\"34 The Respondent also considers the Tribunal's focus on Article 26(7) of the Treaty in its Questions Nos. 1-7 of 26 October 2018 suggests that it was deliberating regarding *The PV Investors v. Spain*.35\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 89.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 83.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 84.\n\n120.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"any year-long deliberation on a matter outside the record of the arbitration and without providing Respondent an opportunity to make the submissions on a matter indeed unknown to it, is a violation of Respondent's right to be heard.\"36 The Respondent notes that it cannot establish the contents of the Tribunal's deliberations with certainty, but submits that the appearance of bias arising from the Tribunal's Questions Nos. 1-7 and its refusal to answer the Respondent's question is sufficient.37\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para 149.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 151-156.\n\n121.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the recent annulment decision in *Eiser v. Kingdom of Spain* establishes that illicit deliberations are not a novelty and that the participation of a conflicted arbitrator may taint the Tribunal's deliberations.38\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Eiser Annulment, paras. 75-76.\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"the notion of 'illicit deliberations' is a novelty to international arbitration, made up by Germany.\"39 According to the Claimants, there are no rules restricting the matters on which a tribunal may deliberate.40\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 28.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 28.\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent's account of the Tribunal's supposed deliberations is speculative and the inferences it would draw unreasonable.41 According to the Claimants, no inferences can reasonably be drawn from the Tribunal refusing to answer the Respondent's questions on deliberations it is obliged to keep secret.42 Nor can inferences be reasonably drawn from the Tribunal's Questions.43 In any event, the Claimants consider that, even if the Tribunal had deliberated regarding *The PV Investors v. Spain*, there would have been nothing improper. The Claimants submit that \"[t]here is no basis for assuming that any deliberation on *PV Investors* would have been to the detriment of Germany.\"44 According to the Claimants, the Tribunal \"was under no obligation to inform the Parties of its underlying internal \u2013 and confidential \u2013 motivations for raising Questions 1-7, let alone invite the Parties to comment on every potential legal authority pertinent to the questions.\"45 Finally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent contradicts itself in arguing that the Tribunal supposedly had deliberations on Article 26(7) of the Treaty, which were allegedly improper for involving matters not known to the Parties, while at the same time arguing that these same deliberations prompted the Tribunal to pose an extensive set of questions to the Parties.46\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, paras. 30-32.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 33.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 34.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 38.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 41.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 42.\n\n124.\n\nI note that the second ground for disqualification in the Respondent's Proposal was raised in a timely fashion. The Respondent's Proposal was submitted on 16 April 2020, 20 days after I understand the Respondent to have obtained a copy of Judge Brower's Opinion on 27 March 2020. I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n125.\n\nTurning to the substance of the Respondent's Proposal, it would suffice to note that the Respondent's allegations are entirely speculative. The Respondent has introduced no direct evidence of the Tribunal's deliberations, but relies entirely upon three factual points:\n\n(a) that the tribunal in *The PV Investors v. Spain*, including Judge Brower, decided a question of the application of Article 26(7) of the Treaty;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal posed to the Parties a series of questions concerning Article 26(7) of the Treaty; and\n\n(c) that the Tribunal collectively, and Judge Brower individually, declined to answer the Respondent's questions regarding the content of the Tribunal's deliberations.\n\nTaken together, I do not see that this matrix reasonably supports any inference as to what the Tribunal did or did not discuss.\n\n126.\n\nBeyond this factual point, however, it appears to me that the Respondent considers it improper for the Tribunal to discuss any authority or legal theory other than those proposed by the Parties. In my view, there is no basis for such a restriction. Due process generally entails that a tribunal should not base its decision on legal theories or authorities that are beyond the Parties' reasonable contemplation, but it cannot require a tribunal in approaching its decision to close its mind to any considerations other than those advanced by counsel. This would also be at odds with the ICSID Convention's requirement that arbitrators have recognized competence in the field of law. The normal practice would rather be for a tribunal to explore such theories or authorities with the parties, but only if the tribunal in fact considered them essential to its decision-making.\n\n127.\n\nFinally, I do not see that this conclusion is altered by the recent annulment decision in *Eiser v. Kingdom of Spain*. As I understand *Eiser*, it stands for the proposition that an award may be annulled where an arbitrator is found to be conflicted, and thus lacking the capacity to exercise independent judgment, after the proceedings are concluded. The rationale of *Eiser* is that it cannot be known to what extent the conflicted arbitrator influenced the decision-making of his or her colleagues, and the timing of the revelation is such that there is no opportunity for disqualification and no chance for the remaining members of the Tribunal to revisit their decision. In the present case, however, I do not see Judge Brower's Opinion as giving rise to an issue conflict and correspondingly see no impropriety in his involvement in the Tribunal's deliberations.\n\n128.\n\nIn sum, I do not consider that the record identified by the Respondent reasonably supports inferences regarding the content of the Tribunal's deliberations or an inference that the members of the Tribunal manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment\".\n\n**C. Ground Three: The Tribunal's Decision to Proceed with the Hearing by Videoconference**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal's \"decision to hold any hearing on quantum online despite Respondent's well-founded objection shows that it views the hearing as a mere formality, and hence creates an appearance of bias.\"47\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 163.\n\n130.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's proposal to conduct the hearing by videoconference, the Respondent contends that the hearing on quantum in this matter was too complex and involved too many witnesses to proceed by videoconference.48 The Respondent argues that video hearings could not approach the value of in-person cross-examination and raise concerns about witness coaching.49 The Respondent further argues that proceeding by videoconference would greatly impede its ability to coordinate with its experts and counsel.50\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 91.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 92.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 93.\n\n131.\n\nAs a legal matter, the Respondent submits that it has a right to an oral hearing and further submits that the ICSID Rules \"do not allow holding a hearing online against the will of one party,\" as online hearings are not provided for in the Rules.51 According to the Respondent, videoconference hearings may be appropriate for some hearings, such as those without witnesses or experts, or with smaller amounts at stake.52 The Respondent, however, considers a videoconference hearing inappropriate for the present proceeding and argues that there is increasing recognition that videoconferencing cannot fully substitute for all hearings.53\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 166-169.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 164-165.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 171-174.\n\n132.\n\nFinally, the Respondent invites ICSID and the PCA to provide statistics on the number of hearings cancelled in March-June 2020.54\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 175\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal's decision to proceed with a hearing by videoconference provides \"no basis to infer a lack of impartiality.\"55\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 46.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the contemplated hearing would be a \"limited supplemental evidentiary hearing\", the principal hearing in this matter having taken place in 2016.56 As such, the Claimants contend that the Respondent had no absolute right to a further hearing, with hearings on ancillary matters being within the discretion of the Tribunal.57 In any event, the Claimants argue, there is no right whatsoever to an in-person hearing: the ICSID Rules \"neither explicitly allow nor deny the possibility of an oral hearing by videoconference.\"58\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, paras. 47-48.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 49.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 50.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that even if the decision to proceed by videoconference were a procedural error, \"there is no basis to infer bias\".59 The Claimants submit that the mere fact that a ruling is adverse to the preferences of a party cannot support an inference that the tribunal lacks impartiality.60 The Claimants also note that a videoconference hearing would not be specifically detrimental to the Respondent, as the Claimants would also have to overcome the challenges associated with participants scattered across many locations.61\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 55.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 56.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 57.\n\n136.\n\nI note that the third ground for disqualification in the Respondent's Proposal was raised in a timely fashion. The Respondent's Proposal was submitted on 16 April 2020, 17 days after the Tribunal decided to go ahead with a hearing by videoconference on 30 March 2020. I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n137.\n\nTurning to the substance of the Respondent's proposal, as I understand the Respondent's position, the Tribunal is said to have taken a decision that exceeds its powers under the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that disfavors the Respondent, creating an appearance of bias. I note that disqualification proceedings are not a mechanism for the appeal or annulment of a decision with which a party disagrees. To prevail, the Respondent must establish not that the Tribunal's decision was wrong, but that the record supports the inference that the Tribunal manifestly lacks impartiality and cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n138.\n\nWith respect to the Tribunal's powers under the ICSID Rules to conduct videoconference hearings, I consider this to be a matter that falls to the Tribunal itself to decide as a matter of *kompetenz-kompetenz*. While I take no position on the proper interpretation of this aspect of the ICSID Rules, I do not see that even an erroneous interpretation of the Rules would\u2014 without more\u2014support an inference that the ruling was the product of a lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n139.\n\nTurning to the appropriateness of a videoconference hearing in the present matter, I note that any arbitral tribunal is called on to balance considerations of efficiency and avoiding delay with ensuring that the parties are properly heard. It will frequently be the case that one party will be more concerned with speed and see less need to delve deeply into issues it considers straight-forward, while the other may be less concerned regarding delay and prefer a more extensive exploration of the matter. Indeed, the recent record of the present proceedings, set out in detail above, shows stark differences between the Parties concerning the time required for the final procedural steps. Due process may be infringed if a party's opportunity to present its case is unduly curtailed; but due process may also be infringed if proceedings are so delayed as to impair the relief envisaged by the Treaty. The Tribunal itself is best placed to balance these considerations and I do not see that a procedural disagreement\u2014or the fact that the Tribunal's decision was supported by the Claimants and opposed by the Respondent\u2014reasonably provides a basis for an inference of bias. Accordingly, I do not consider that the Tribunal's decision to proceed with a hearing by videoconference can reasonably be considered to support an inference that the Tribunal manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n140.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Respondent's request for statistics on the postponement of hearings at ICSID and the PCA, I consider that disqualification proceedings are intended to address a situation in which an arbitrator or tribunal's lack of the qualities required of them is already manifest. Disqualification proceedings are not a mechanism to develop evidence on the basis of which disqualification might be proposed. Accordingly, I do not see that the statistics sought by the Respondent would meaningfully add to the analysis set out above.\n\n**D. Ground Four: The Tribunal's Decision to Maintain its Procedural Calendar**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal \"restricted Respondent's right to defend itself against Claimants' 29 June 2011 valuation by forcing an unbearable procedural calendar on Respondent\" and refusing the Respondent's requests for extensions in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.62\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 101.\n\n142.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it brought to the Tribunal's attention (a) prior commitments by its quantum expert that limited her availability during the period allocated for the preparation of the Respondent's Rejoinder to Question No. 8,63 and (b) additional difficulties presented by the Respondent's quantum expert team working remotely during the \"stay at home\" order in Texas, without access to their files or reference materials.64 The Respondent further submits that it required additional time to prepare for an online hearing while its counsel team was scattered across different locations, working from home and juggling domestic responsibilities, and only able to prepare through remote technology, while also making the logistical arrangements necessary to participate in the videoconference hearing.65\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 103-105.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 111-114.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 115-122.\n\n143.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Tribunal's procedural decision shows no understanding of the real difficulties faced by the Respondent. Instead the Respondent considers that the Tribunal had \"already made up its mind and prejudged the matter, unwilling to reconsider even in the face of unprecedented circumstances.\"66 The Respondent also considers that the Tribunal's refusal to consider extensions disproportionately affects the Respondent, insofar as the coronavirus emerged during the period for the preparation of the Respondent's Rejoinder to Question No. 867 and insofar as the Respondent's counsel team is more significantly affected by public health considerations.68\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 186.\n\nRespondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 187.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 188.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent's request for the postponement of the hearing must be seen against the background of the proceedings, in which the schedule \"has been revised numerous times at the request of Germany.\"69 The Claimants consider there to be no basis \"now for the Secretary-General of the PCA in his recommendation or the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in his decision, to question this procedural decision taken by the Arbitral Tribunal with direct knowledge of the procedural history and the issues to be addressed\".70\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 60.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 76.\n\n145.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit, even if the Tribunal was wrong, there is no evidence of a manifest lack of independence or impartiality. According to the Claimants, \"[i]n essence, the argument is thus that, since Germany believes the decision was wrong, it must have been based on bias.\"71 Not only do the Claimants consider this not grounds to infer a lack of independence and impartiality, they emphasize that the Tribunal granted the Respondent numerous extensions over the Claimants' objections and that \"[i]f anything, the schedule set by the Arbitral Tribunal on Question No. 8 has catered more to Germany's preferences than to Claimants.\"72\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 78.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Second Disqualification Proposal, para. 79.\n\n146.\n\nI note that the fourth ground for disqualification in the Respondent's Proposal was raised in a timely fashion. The Respondent's Proposal was submitted on 16 April 2020, three days after the Tribunal decided to maintain its procedural calendar on 13 April 2020. I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n147.\n\nTurning to the substance of the Respondent's Proposal, however, I again consider this to be a procedural matter that falls to the Tribunal to decide. As with the decision to proceed with a hearing by videoconference, decisions on extensions and scheduling necessarily involve the weighing of competing considerations and the balancing of the rights and interests of the Parties. It is the Tribunal that is familiar with the issues and stake and the detailed history of these proceedings and that is thus placed to effectively balance such competing considerations. An adverse procedural decision does not by itself give rise to an inference of bias, and I do not see anything in the Tribunal's decision to maintain its procedural calendar that could reasonably be considered to support an inference that the Tribunal manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n**E. Ground Five: Judge Brower's Comments on the Respondent's Disqualification Proposal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Judge Brower's Comments of 1 May 2020 are themselves an independent ground for disqualification.73\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 128\n\n149.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Judge Brower's Comments show that his non-disclosure of his Opinion in *The PV Investors v. Spain* \"was not an 'honest exercise of discretion'\".74 Rather than offering an explanation for non-disclosure, or engaging with his disclosure obligations, the Respondent considers that Judge Brower \"misrepresent[ed] the Parties' prior submissions on substantive rights under the ECT\" in an effort to \"negate the confluence between his 2014 Dissent and the present arbitration's issue\".75 Indeed, the Respondent notes that Judge Brower nowhere addressed ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2), concerning disclosures.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 129.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 129.\n\n150.\n\nAs a legal matter, the Respondent relies upon *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador*76 for the proposition an arbitrator's response to a disqualification proposal may itself constitute grounds for disqualification.77 The Respondent considers that Judge Brower neglected Rule 9(3) of the ICSID Rules, which permits arbitrators to provide factual explanations in response to a disqualification proposal but not, in the Respondent's view, arguments or submissions.78 Instead, the Respondent submits, Judge Brower's Comments \"abandoned all the distance required for independent judgment\" and \"focused his entire submission on a rebuttal of Respondent.\"79 Effectively, the Respondent argues, he \"chose to act... as an advocate arbitrator in order to supplement Claimants over-brief submissions.\"80 The Respondent considers the tone of Judge Brower's comments to be in keeping with his public comments on other occasions that led to his disqualification in *Perenco v. Ecuador*81 and *Vale v. BSG Resources*.82\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, 13 December 2013 (**Respondent's Attachment 108**).\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 141.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 137.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, paras. 131-132.\n\nRespondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 134.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator, 8 December 2009 (**Respondent's Attachment 188**).\n\n*Vale S.A. v. BSG Resources Limited*, LCIA Case No. 142683, Decision on Challenge to Full Tribunal, 4 August 2016; see Respondent's Final Observations Regarding the Second Proposal for Disqualification of the Tribunal, para. 144.\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimants decline to respond to this ground for disqualification.\n\n152.\n\nI note that the Respondent's fifth ground for disqualification was raised in a timely manner. Judge Brower's comments were made on 17 April 2020; the Respondent identified this as a further ground for disqualification 21 days later, in its submission of 8 May 2020. I consider that the Proposal, with respect to this ground was filed promptly for the purpose of Rule 9(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n153.\n\nTurning to the substance of the Respondent's proposal, I concur with the general point recognized in *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador* that an arbitrator's response to a disqualification proposal may itself evidence a lack of impartiality, even where the initial grounds for disqualification would not. Exchanges regarding the circumstances alleged to give rise to grounds for disqualification may well reveal animosity towards a party that is incompatible with continued service as an arbitrator.\n\n154.\n\nHaving reviewed Judge Brower's Comments, I do not consider that his Comments are like those giving rise to disqualification in *Burlington Resources*, *Perenco*, or *Vale*. Judge Brower's Comments remain focused on responding to the points raised by the Respondent in its Disqualification Proposal and do not engage with extraneous matters or devolve into *ad hominem* attack. Importantly, I do not agree with the Respondent's characterization of his comments as having failed to offer an explanation for his non-disclosure of his Opinion in *The PV Investors v. Spain*. As I understand Judge Brower's Comments, his rationale for non- disclosure is that no issue conflict was created by his Opinion as it dealt with an aspect of Article 26(7) of the Treaty distinct from that at issue in present proceedings. The Respondent disagrees with this view, but that does not suffice to make Judge Brower's Comments something other than a response to the Respondent's Proposal.\n\n155.\n\nTaken as a whole, I do not consider that Judge Brower's comments can reasonably be considered to support an inference that the he manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n156.\n\nIt follows from the legal principles set out above that a party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator must prove the existence of objective facts from which a reasonable third person may infer a manifest lack of the arbitrator's impartiality or independence. Subjective inferences or beliefs are insufficient.\n\n157.\n\nAs set out above, I do not consider that the record before me can reasonably be considered to support an inference that either Judge Brower or the Tribunal as a whole manifestly cannot be \"relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" Therefore, I conclude that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proving that Judge Brower (with respect to Grounds One and Five), or any of the three members of the Arbitral Tribunal (with respect to Grounds Two to Four), manifestly lacks any of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in relation to the four grounds on which the Proposal is based, or the fifth ground arising from Judge Brower's response to the Proposal itself.\n\n**VI. Recommendation**\n----------------------\n\n158.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal be rejected."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of the Three Members of the Tribunal", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2020-07-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of the Three Members of the Tribunal\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Respondent in the above-referenced case, filed a Proposal to Disqualify the Members of the Tribunal (the \"Proposal\").\n\n[2].\n\nThe Proposal was submitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.
