INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 November 2022, the ICSID Secretariat received a request for arbitration from Ms. Vasilisa Ershova and Mr. Jegor Jer\u0161ov [\"**Claimants**\"], requesting to institute an ICSID arbitration proceeding against the Republic of Bulgaria [\"**Respondent**\" or \"**Bulgaria**\"], pursuant to Articles 25 and 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States [the \"**ICSID Convention**\"], Rule 1 and 2 of the ICSID Institution Rules [the \"**Institution Rules**\"], and Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty [\"**ECT**\"]1.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 1.\n\n2.\n\nFollowing an exchange of correspondence between the ICSID Secretariat and Claimants, the request for arbitration, as supplemented by Claimants\u2019 correspondence of 7 and 8 November 2022 [the \"**Request for Arbitration**\"], was registered on 11 November 2022.\n\n3.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, Claimants asserted that their written consent to submit the dispute to arbitration had occurred on 27 April 20212. Therefore, ICSID registered the proceeding pursuant to the arbitration rules that were in force on 27 April 2021, namely the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as amended and effective on 10 April 2006 [the \"**2006 Arbitration Rules**\"].\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 99 and 109.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing the constitution of the Tribunal on 4 May 2023, the Tribunal set a date for the first session and, on 30 May 2023, circulated a draft order addressing the procedure for the Parties\u2019 discussion and comments. That draft procedural order was premised on the applicability of the 2006 Arbitration Rules, in line with the registration of the proceeding.\n\n5.\n\nLater that same day, Respondent filed an objection under the 2006 Arbitration Rule 41(5)3. In footnote 1 of that submission, Respondent indicated that it was presenting its objection under the 2006 Arbitration Rules because those were the rules under which the proceeding had been registered, but that it reserved its right to contest the application of the 2006 Arbitration Rules in lieu of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 1 July 2022 [the \"**2022 Arbitration Rules**\"].\n\n2006 Arbitration Rule 41(5) provides that: \"Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit\".\n\n6.\n\nOn 21 June 2023, Respondent submitted, on behalf of the Parties, the Parties' joint comments to the first draft procedural order. That same day, Respondent filed a letter addressing the application of the 2022 Arbitration Rules to this proceeding [\"**Respondent\u2019s Application**\"].\n\n7.\n\nOn the evening of 22 June 2023, Claimants sent an email, *inter alia,* objecting to the timing and mode by which Respondent had made submissions regarding which set of Arbitration Rules should apply. The email briefly responded to the substance of Respondent's arguments in this regard. Later that evening, Respondent sent a brief response to Claimants' objections.\n\n8.\n\nOn the following day, 23 June 2023, the Tribunal held the first session with the Parties [\"**First Session**\"], the details of which will be summarized in a subsequent procedural order. At the First Session, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit their observations regarding the applicable Arbitration Rules by 30 June 2023.4 These directions were recorded in the Tribunal's email to the parties of 26 June 2023.\n\nThese directions were further summarized in the Tribunal\u2019s email communication of 26 June 2023.\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 June 2023, in accordance with the Tribunal's directions, Claimants submitted their observations on Respondent's Application [\"**Claimants\u2019 Response**\"].\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize (**II.**) and analyse (**III.**) the Parties' positions regarding the applicable Arbitration Rules, and then make its decision (**IV.**).\n\n**II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nBoth Parties agree that, by operation of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, absent party agreement, any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the Parties consented to arbitration5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Application, para. 1; Claimants\u2019 Response, p. 1.\n\n12.\n\nClaimants\u2019 position is that the Parties\u2019 consent was locked in before the 2022 Arbitration Rules entered into force6. Indeed, Claimants aver that they accepted Bulgaria\u2019s standing offer to arbitrate contained in the ECT when they served the Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration, dated 27 April 2021 [the \"**Notice of Intent**\"]7. In Claimants\u2019 words, the Notice of Intent8:\n\n*\"[...] includes Claimants' express and written consent to submit their disputes with Bulgaria to the jurisdiction of the Center under Article 26(4) of the ECT.*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 6. *See also* Request for Arbitration, para. 99.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 99. *See also* para. 109.\n\n13.\n\nClaimants argue that since they consented to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration on 27 April 2021 - *i*.*e*., before the 2022 Arbitration Rules entered into force - the present arbitration must be governed by the 2006 Arbitration Rules9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 6.\n\n14.\n\nBulgaria, on the contrary, submits that Claimants\u2019 Notice of Intent could not constitute the requisite consent to ICSID Arbitration. In fact, Bulgaria avers that Claimants did not consent to ICSID arbitration until they filed the Request for Arbitration dated 2 November 2022, with the consequence that the 2022 Arbitration Rules should apply10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Application, para. 3.\n\n**A. Respondent\u2019s Application**\n-------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nRespondent argues that under the applicable provisions of the ECT, an investor must first request to resolve the dispute amicably, and if the dispute is not resolved within three months, the investor may *then* elect a dispute resolution method under Article 26(2)(c) of the ECT. Article 26(4) of the ECT provides that the investor must provide its \"further\" consent to ICSID arbitration at this time11.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 4-11.\n\n16.\n\nOn Respondent\u2019s case, the Notice of Intent was when Claimants first requested amicable settlement. The effect of this document was merely to trigger the three-month period for potential amicable resolution, and only thereafter could Claimants choose to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration by providing further consent under Article 26(4) of the ECT12.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 14.\n\n17.\n\nRespondent relies, in support of its arguments, on the recent ICSID Case No. ARB/22/23, *Benabderrahmane v. Qatar**,* in which the tribunal determined that the claimant\u2019s notice letter did not constitute consent to ICSID arbitration, and that the claimant had consented through his request for arbitration, such that the 2022 Arbitration Rules applied13.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 17, citing to *Tayeb Benabderrahmane v. The State of Qatar,* ICSID Case No. ARB/22/23, Procedural Order No. 1 dated 13 March 2023, \"Enclosure A\".\n\n18.\n\nBulgaria avers that, in any event, assuming that the Tribunal were to decide that the 2006 Arbitration Rules apply, the 2022 Arbitration Rules reflect best practices in ICSID arbitration that the Tribunal may consider to the extent that they do not directly conflict with any provision of the 2006 Arbitration Rules14.\n\nRespondent's Application, pp. 3-4.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Response**\n--------------------------\n\n19.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s reading of Article 26 of the ECT is misguided in light of the well-established ICSID arbitration practice, where no issue has been taken with various claimants giving consent to arbitrate when submitting their notices of dispute15.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 2.\n\n20.\n\nClaimants argue that the ICSID case on which Respondent relies to support its Application *(Benabderrahmane v. Qatar):*\n\n- Was not an ECT case and did not discuss Article 26 of the ECT16;\n\n- Was not analogous in that the claimant in that case had not given its express consent in the notice of dispute and was seeking to have consent inferred from the fact that the notice was a mandatory part of the applicable BIT procedure; and\n\n- Was a case in which the tribunal expressly acknowledged that consent can be given prior to the request for arbitration, and cited to multiple ICSID awards that have upheld this basic rule17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 email of 22 June 2023; Claimants\u2019 Response, pp. 2-3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 3, citing to *Tayeb Benabderrahmane v. The State of Qatar,* ICSID Case No. ARB/22/23, Procedural Order No. 1 dated 13 March 2023, \"Enclosure A\", para. 17.\n\n21.\n\nClaimants note that, contrary to the *Benabderrahmane v. Qatar* case, Claimants provided their express and unequivocal consent to ICSID Arbitration in para. 105 of their Notice of Intent18.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 3.\n\n22.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argue that Article 26 of the ECT contains no language that could be read as if the ECT precluded the provision of consent by investors before the expiry of the three-month cool-down period19. The requirement in Article 26(4) for the investor to \"further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to [ICSID arbitration]\" is not a requirement to provide a supplementary consent, in addition to that provided in the notice of dispute20. The word \"further\" simply indicates that the investor's mere choice or preference to submit its dispute to ICSID arbitration does not in and of itself satisfy the jurisdictional condition under the ECT and the ICSID Convention; the investor is \"further\" required to provide its consent *in writing* prior to submitting its dispute to ICSID arbitration21.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 4.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 5.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 6.\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe set of Arbitration Rules which applies to a particular proceeding is determined in accordance with Article 44 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*\"Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question [Emphasis added].*\n\n24.\n\nBulgaria gave its unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration, when it signed and ratified the ECT, which in its Article 26(3)(a) provides that22:\n\n*\"(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\nECT, Exhibit CLA-1, Article 26(3).\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal is called upon to determine when *Claimants* gave their consent to ICSID arbitration, given that the date on which consent was perfected is the date relevant to determine the applicable Arbitration Rules.\n\n26.\n\nArticle 26 of the ECT, on the settlement of disputes between an Investor and a Contracting Party to the ECT, provides in its relevant part that23:\n\n*\"(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.*\n\n*(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.*\n\n*(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:*\n\n*(a) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\"), if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID Convention; or*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*(5) (a) The consent given in paragraph (3) together with the written consent of the Investor given pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for:*\n\n*(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention [...]; [...]. \" [Emphasis added]*\n\nECT, Exhibit CLA-1, Article 26.\n\n27.\n\nIt follows from the above provisions that, if possible, a dispute between an investor and a Contracting State to the ECT should be settled amicably. If within three months the dispute cannot be amicably solved, the investor may choose to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration - in which case, the investor must \"provide its consent in writing\".\n\n28.\n\nClaimants argue that their consent in writing to ICSID arbitration is contained in the Notice of Intent. The Notice of Intent, attached to the Request for Arbitration as Exhibit C-5, states that24:\n\n*\"Pursuant to Article 26(4) [of the ECT] Claimants accept Bulgaria\u2019s offer to arbitrate and hereby consent for the dispute to be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\"), to which both Lithuania and Bulgaria are parties\" [Emphasis added].*\n\nNotice of Intent, Exhibit C-5, para. 105.\n\n29.\n\nThe wording of the Notice of Intent is unequivocal: Claimants clearly gave their \"consent in writing\" to ICSID arbitration in accordance with Article 26(4) of the ECT when they filed such document on 27 April 2021.\n\n30.\n\nThe necessary consequence is that the Parties\u2019 consent was locked in as of that date25.\n\nWithout prejudice to the Tribunal's decision on Respondent's Objection that Claimants are not \"Investors\" under the ECT and thus are not eligible to consent to arbitrate any alleged ECT dispute *(see* Respondent's Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 dated 30 May 2023; Respondent's Application, paras. 12-13).\n\nRespondent\u2019s counterarguments\n-----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nBulgaria proposes a different reading of Article 26 of the ECT. It argues that, when Claimants filed the Notice of Intent, they merely triggered the three-month period for amicable resolution of the dispute, and *only thereafter* could they choose to submit the dispute under Article 26(4) of the ECT by providing \"further consent\".\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Bulgaria\u2019s argument is based on an incorrect reading of Article 26. Nothing in Article 26 precludes the investor from providing its consent to arbitration at a stage prior to the request for arbitration. In fact, nothing precludes the investor from providing its consent at the same time as it offers to amicably solve the dispute - which is precisely what happened in the present case.\n\n33.\n\nIndeed, with their Notice of Intent, Claimants gave notice to Bulgaria of their intention to submit their dispute to international arbitration and accepted Bulgaria's standing offer pursuant to Article 26(4) of the ECT26. At the same time, Claimants clarified that they remained ready to find an amicable solution27:\n\n*\"Claimants send this notice reluctantly. [Claimants] would have preferred to get justice through Bulgaria\u2019s courts, but that has proven impossible. Nevertheless, Claimants are prepared to meet with the Government representatives to explore solutions.*\n\n*How ever, should the Parties prove unable to find an amicable, mutually acceptable solution to the dispute during the Treaty waiting period, Claimants intends to initiate arbitration under the ECT against the Republic of Bulgaria, alleging breaches of Article 10 and Article 13 of the Treaty. \" [Emphasis added]*\n\nNotice of Intent, Exhibit C-5, paras. 104-105.\n\nNotice of Intent, Exhibit C-5, paras. 110-111.\n\n34.\n\nThe wording \"further consent\" in Article 26(4) must be interpreted as a consent \"further\" to that of the State, which is mentioned in Article 26(3) - not temporarily as an additional stage of consent.\n\n*Benabderrahmane v. Qatar*\n--------------------------\n\n35.\n\nRespondent relies on the recent ICSID case, *Benabderrahmane v. Qatar,* in which the tribunal found that the proceedings should be governed by the 2022 Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal finds, however, that the *Benabderrahmane v. Qatar* decision is of no avail to Bulgaria's case, for three reasons:\n\n36.\n\nFirst, the case concerns a treaty between the French Republic and the State of Qatar - it does not involve the ECT. The instrument of consent being different, the requirements for consent may not necessarily be the same as in the present case.\n\n37.\n\nSecond, the tribunal and the parties in that case agreed that, both under the 2006 or the 2022 Arbitration Rules, the date of consent by the investor could not be *later* - but consent could always take place *earlier* - than the filing of the request for arbitration28:\n\n*\"The Parties agree that under either the 2006 or 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules, the date of such consent cannot be any later than the filing of the Request for Arbitration, but they also agree that a claimant's acceptance and consent can take place earlier. The Tribunal notes that this agreement is in accord with the view that other tribunals and authorities have taken in such matters.\" [Emphasis added]*\n\n*Tayeb Benabderrahmane v. The State of Qatar,* ICSID Case No. ARB/22/23, Procedural Order No. 1 dated 13 March 2023, \"Enclosure A\", para. 17.\n\n38.\n\nIn support of this proposition, the tribunal cited no less than 11 ICSID awards or decisions. While these ICSID awards and decisions are not from cases brought under the ECT, the Tribunal is aware of at least one public ECT case, which it references here *iura novit curia,* in which arbitral tribunal (constituted under the SCC Rules) found that an investor\u2019s consent to arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT was contained in a notice of dispute filed *prior* to the request for arbitration.29\n\n*Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v. Republic of Tajikistan,* SCC Case No. V064/2008, Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 2 September 2009, paras. 122-126.\n\n39.\n\nThird, the case can be distinguished on the facts. In *Benabderrahmane v. Qatar* the tribunal found that the language used by claimant in his notice of dispute was \"ambiguous\" and did not constitute an unequivocal consent in writing30. There is no such ambiguity in the present case: in their Notice of Intent, Claimants *clearly* and *unambiguously* gave their consent in writing to ICSID arbitration.\n\n*Tayeb Benabderrahmane v. The State of Qatar,* ICSID Case No. ARB/22/23, Procedural Order No. 1 dated 13 March 2023, \"Enclosure A\", paras. 26-30.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n40.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 consent to arbitration31 was given in the Notice of Intent of 27 April 2021. Therefore, the \"date on which the parties consented to arbitration\", for the purposes of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, was 27 April 2021.\n\n(ii) The 2006 Arbitration Rules are applicable to this proceeding, as these were the \"Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration\".\n\nDate: 18 July 2023\n\nWithout prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Respondent\u2019s Objection that Claimants are not \"Investors\" under the ECT and thus are not eligible to consent to arbitrate any alleged ECT dispute (*see* Respondent\u2019s Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 dated May 30, 2023; Respondent\u2019s Application, paras. 12-13)."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection Under Art. 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules", "Type": "ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)", "Date": "2023-07-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection Under Art. 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes [\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\"] on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty [\"**ECT**\"] and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966 [\"**ICSID Convention**\"]. The dispute relates to investments in the Bulgarian energy sector originally held by Claimants' deceased father, and the treatment by Bulgaria of these.\n\n2.\n\nThis Decision sets out the Tribunal's reasons and decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection under Article 41(5) of the ICSID 2006 Arbitration Rules [\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"].\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n3.\n\nClaimants in this arbitration are Ms. Vasilisa Ershova and Mr. Jegor Jer\u0161ov [\"**Heirs**\" or \"**Claimants**\"], the two surviving children of Mr. Denis Jer\u0161ov and both Lithuanian citizens. Respondent is the Republic of Bulgaria [\"**Bulgaria**\" or \"**Respondent**\"].\n\n4.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page ii.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 November 2022, the ICSID Secretariat received a request for arbitration from Ms. Vasilisa Ershova and Mr. Jegor Jer\u0161ov, requesting to institute an ICSID arbitration proceeding against the Republic of Bulgaria, pursuant to Articles 25 and 36 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 1 and 2 of the ICSID Institution Rules [the \"**Institution Rules**\"], and Article 26 of the ECT1.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 1.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing an exchange of correspondence between the ICSID Secretariat and Claimants, the request for arbitration, as supplemented by Claimants' correspondence of 7 and 8 November 2022 [the \"**Request for Arbitration**\"], was registered on 11 November 2022, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and the Parties were notified of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a national of Spain, President, appointed by agreement of the parties; Jan Paulsson, a national of France, Sweden, and Bahrain, appointed by Claimants; and Toby Landau KC, a national of the U.K., appointed by Respondent.\n\n9.\n\nOn 4 May 2023, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Anna Holloway, ICSID Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nFollowing the constitution of the Tribunal, by email of 22 May 2023 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would be held on 23 June 20232.\n\nICSID's email to the Parties of 22 May 2023.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 May 2023, Bulgaria filed a Preliminary Objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, on the grounds that Claimants' claims are manifestly without legal merit, together with Exhibits R-0001 through R-0004 and Legal Authorities RL-0001 through RL-0033 [the \"**Rule 41(5) Application**\" or \"**Respondent's Application**\"]3.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 1.\n\n12.\n\nOn 16 June 2023, the Parties agreed to the appointment of Ms. Francisca Seara Cardoso as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 June 2023, Claimants submitted a request for provisional measures together with Exhibits C-0010 through C-0012 and Legal Authorities CLA-4 through CLA-8.\n\n14.\n\nOn 23 June 2023, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session by videoconference under Rule 21(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules [\"**First Session**\"], in order to deal with case management issues. During the First Session, it was agreed that the written phase of the proceedings on Respondent's Preliminary Objection would consist of one round of written argument, followed by a short hearing through Zoom (if needed).\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's instructions4, on 30 June 2023, Claimants submitted their Answer to Respondent's Preliminary Objection, together with Legal Authorities CL-0009 through CL-0015 [\"**Claimants' Answer**\"]. At the same time, Claimants indicated that they would refile their request for provisional measures at some point in the future, and asked the Tribunal to refrain from ruling on the 18 June 2023 request in the meantime.\n\nICSID's email to the Parties of 1 June 2023.\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 July 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, ruling on a disagreement between the Parties as to which set of ICSID Rules are applicable to this proceeding. The Tribunal confirmed therein that the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules are the set of rules applicable. The Secretary of the Tribunal, in the cover letter conveying the procedural order, also conveyed to the Parties the Tribunal's view that no further submissions, written or oral, would be required for the disposition of the Respondent's Application.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe following factual background summarily describes the facts that are necessary to understand and adjudicate this Rule 41(5) Application and is based on Claimants' statement of the facts in support of their claims. These facts are accepted for the purposes of this decision only, and without prejudice to a final determination of the facts by the Tribunal at a later stage.\n\nMr. Jer\u0161ov's investments in Bulgaria\n------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nMr. Denis Jer\u0161ov, a Lithuanian citizen5, was the co-founder of the oil and gas trading company Naftex6. In 1995, Mr. Jer\u0161ov entered the Bulgarian market on behalf of one of Naftex's biggest clients \u2013 the Russian oil company Yukos \u2013 to create a subsidiary - Yukos Petroleum Bulgaria AD [\"**YBP**\"] - and run Bulgarian operations in association with a local entrepreneur, Mr. Mitko Sabev7. YPB was 99% held by Yukos Finconsult Ltd., Cyprus, whose owner was Mr. Jer\u0161ov; the remaining 1% was held by Mr. Sabev, who was also the company's CEO8.\n\n**C-1**.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 12.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 12.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 14.\n\n19.\n\nIn 1997, in the context of the privatization of Bulgaria's energy market, YBP was invited by Bulgaria to submit a bid for the privatization of Petrol's majority stake9. Two years later, the International Consortium Bulgaria [\"**ICB**\"], a consortium led by YBP, was pronounced the winner of the tender10.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 15.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 16.\n\n20.\n\nShortly thereafter, YBP was renamed to Naftex Bulgaria Holding AD [\"**NBH**\"]. NBH had a 51% stake in Petrol, while the minority stake was traded publicly on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. In the following years, NBH began purchasing interests from other shareholders in Petrol, up to the point of holding over 95% of the shares in Petrol11.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 19-20.\n\nBulgaria's alleged measures\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn 2001, the National Security Agency of Bulgaria issued a 10-year ban against Mr. Jer\u0161ov, alleging that Mr. Jer\u0161ov presented a threat to national security. Mr. Jer\u0161ov was then forced to leave the country12. This ban was overturned four years later13. During his absence, Mr. Sabev was left without direct supervision14.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 23-25.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 26-27.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 27.\n\n22.\n\nAfter his return to Bulgaria in 2005, Mr. Jer\u0161ov reorganized the group's business and corporate structure: NHB was renamed to Petrol Holding AD [\"**PEHOLD**\"] and, from a majority shareholding of 95%, Mr. Jer\u0161ov reduced his shareholding to 47.5%, giving a stake of 47.5% to Mr. Sabev (the remaining 5% was held by Mr. Alexander Melnik, one of Mr. Jer\u0161ov's trusted advisors and a classmate)15.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 28-31.\n\n23.\n\nHowever, according to Claimants, Mr. Sabev subsequently colluded with the Bulgarian Government, and initiated a series of actions against Mr. Jer\u0161ov's interests in Petrol16. These actions culminated with Mr. Jer\u0161ov being blocked from exercising control over PEHOLD (and, in turn, over Petrol). Despite several attempts to block these events, through subsequent appeals to both the Bulgaria's courts and executive bodies, Mr. Jer\u0161ov ended up losing control over Petrol for three17 years .\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 32-39.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 40-69.\n\n24.\n\nShortly after regaining control of PEHOLD18, on 2 December 2013, Mr. Jer\u0161ov found out that all the shares of PEHOLD in Petrol had been sold on the stock exchange at 1/3 of their actual trading price19. Again, despite several attempts to investigate, suspend or cancel the sale of the shares, Mr. Jer\u0161ov (through PEHOLD) ended up losing his stake in Petrol, without receiving any of the proceeds of the sale of the shares20.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 70-73.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 74.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 75-81.\n\nMr. Jer\u0161ov's death\n------------------\n\n25.\n\nFour years later, in 2017, Mr. Denis Jer\u0161ov passed away21, leaving behind his two children, Ms. Vasilisa Ershova and Mr. Jegor Jer\u0161ov, Claimants in these proceedings \u2013 who also hold Lithuanian citizenship22.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 6; **C-2**.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 6; **C-3** and **C-4**.\n\n**V. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n26.\n\nRespondent argues that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, the Centre lacks jurisdiction over the dispute, and that the claims presented are without legal merit23:\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 1 and 6-7.\n\n27.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that Article 26 of the ECT specifically requires, as a condition for the Centre's jurisdiction, written consent on the part of the investor who owned or controlled the investment24.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 22-26, citing **RL-11**, Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention, Vol. I (3d ed. 2022), para. 871; and **RL-12**, Kaj Hob\u00e9r, The Energy Charter Treaty: A Commentary (2020), para. 439.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent highlights that Mr. Jer\u0161ov \u2013 the purported investor \u2013 passed away in November 2017, almost four years after the alleged wrongful taking of the investment. Nonetheless, as Mr. Jer\u0161ov died without invoking any of the procedures of Article 26 of the ECT25, it is thus clear that he did not consent in writing to submit a dispute to ICSID arbitration26.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 30.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 6(a), 31.\n\n29.\n\nSecond, Respondent submits that Article 26 of the ECT only applies to disputes over an alleged breach of an obligation in ECT Part III relating to an \"Investment\" of an \"Investor\" in Bulgaria. It does not apply to other disputes, including those of the heirs of an \"Investor\". Considering that Claimants \u2013 Mr. Jer\u0161ov's legal Heirs \u2013 do not claim that they are \"Investors\" under Article 1(7) of the ECT, nor that they owned or controlled any \"Investment\" in Bulgaria pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT, they have no basis to invoke Article 26 of the ECT27.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 6(b), 32-35.\n\n30.\n\nThird, the terms of the ECT do not provide a basis for Claimants to bring claims \"on behalf of\" Mr. Jer\u0161ov or \"in his stead\"28. Unless the possibility of substitution is agreed by both parties to the dispute (*quod non*), there is no basis for a party to submit a dispute \u2013 which is \"*intuitu personae*\" \u2013 to ICSID Arbitration on behalf of another29.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 37.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 38-40.\n\n31.\n\nFurthermore, the ECT provides for the possible assignment of claims only in circumstances of subrogation, pursuant to Article 15. In any case, the assignment contemplated in such provision allows a party to submit a dispute to arbitration on its own behalf, not on behalf of the Investor30. Furthermore, rights and obligations of an *intuitu personae* character are not transferred without the counterparty's agreement. Therefore, unless the terms of the treaty allow the proposed succession, it is not possible to assign claims \u2013 which is precisely the situation of the ECT.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 41-43.\n\n32.\n\nIn this case, Respondent argues, Claimants do not claim that Mr. Jer\u0161ov's claim was assigned or transferred to them, but only that they are entitled to present Mr. Jer\u0161ov's claim, on his behalf, as his Heirs \u2013 which is not permitted under the ECT31.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 43-54.\n\n33.\n\nIn light of the above, Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare that Claimants' claims are manifestly without legal merit, due to the failure to establish a basis for asserting jurisdiction, pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 26 of the ECT32.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 57.\n\n**2. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n34.\n\nClaimants aver that the claims presented in their Request for Arbitration are not manifestly without legal merit and, thus, request the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent's Preliminary Objection and the relief sought therein33.\n\nClaimants' Answer, para. 46.\n\n35.\n\nFirst, Claimants explain that, at the time that Mr. Jer\u0161ov passed away, his investment claims against Bulgaria had already fully crystallized. Such claims are now held by Claimants, as his legal Heirs. Therefore, there is no doubt that Claimants have provided their consent to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT, which is not contested by Respondent34.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 16-19.\n\n36.\n\nSecond, Claimants reject Bulgaria's argument that Article 26 of the ECT only applies to disputes over an alleged breach of an obligation in ECT Part III relating to an \"Investment\" of an \"Investor\" in Bulgaria, on the following three independent and alternative grounds35:\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 20-21.\n\n37.\n\n(i) Bulgaria's breaches of its ECT obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Mr. Jer\u0161ov created a right to bring an action to seek compensation (*chose in action)*, a purely economic right to compensation. This right can pass or be transferred to Claimants (as legal heirs), by way of inheritance law, legal succession or other forms of transfer of rights, who then become entitled to exercise that action by putting forward Mr. Jer\u0161ov's ECT claim under the same conditions as they would apply to Mr. Jer\u0161ov36. The ECT in no way precludes this transfer of economic rights, by way of universal succession, which were properly exercised by Claimants37.\n\nClaimants' Answer, para. 24.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 25-26.\n\n38.\n\nRespondent's position \u2013 denying the heirs of a natural person the possibility to exercise their rights under an investment treaty \u2013 would give rise to absurd consequences: the host State would be granted an opportunity to do away with any potential investment treaty claim by simply causing the death of the natural person investor right after breaching its obligations under a treaty, before the investor had the chance to accept the host State's standing offer and to submit his/her investment treaty claims to arbitration38.\n\nClaimants' Answer, para. 27.\n\n39.\n\n(ii) Alternatively, Claimants argue that, in the face of Bulgaria's breaches of the ECT, the investment was transformed into a residual right (*i.e*., the right to claim damages for breaches of the ECT). Again, by being the current holders of these residual rights arising out of the original investment, the Heirs of Mr. Jer\u0161ov can be deemed \"investors\" for the purposes of Article 26 of the ECT and accept Bulgaria's offer to submit the dispute to arbitration39.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 28-29.\n\n40.\n\n(iii) Furthermore, and in any case, Claimants are still shareholders in PEHOLD \u2013 a company that, despite the wrongful taking of its shares in Petrol (and the entire Petrol Group), still exists. The shares in PEHOLD constitute an investment according to the ECT which, therefore, makes Claimants \"investors\" for the purposes of the Tribunals' jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention40.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 30-32.\n\n41.\n\nThird, Claimants assert that Respondent has failed to provide support for the proposed radical and unprecedented interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT. The only case cited by Respondent \u2013 *Westmoreland v. Canada* [\"***Westmoreland***\"]41 \u2013 actually favours Claimants' position, as the *Westmoreland*'s tribunal found that, in order for it to uphold its jurisdiction, the claimant in that case was expected to \"show that it is the legal successor to [the original investor]\"42. In this case, it is undisputed that Mr. Jer\u0161ov's rights were inherited through universal succession by his Heirs and, therefore, Claimants are eligible to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration43.\n\n**RL-21**, *Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3, Final Award, 31 January 2022.\n\n**RL-21**, *Westmoreland*, para. 220.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 33-36.\n\n42.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, Claimants aver that Respondent has failed to meet the high standard for an application under Rule 41(5). Claimants' case cannot be deemed \"clear and obvious\" nor \"patently unmeritorious\" based on the arbitrary interpretation presented by Respondent in support of which it has failed to offer any authority44.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 37-39.\n\n43.\n\nFinally, Claimants assert that Respondent was well aware that its Preliminary Objection did not comply with the legal test applicable under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), which thus constitutes a textbook example of an abuse of process. Consequently, Claimants submit that the Tribunal should grant an adverse costs order in favour of Claimants with immediate effect45.\n\nClaimants' Answer, paras. 41-45.\n\n**VI. DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn its Rule 41(5) Application, Bulgaria requests, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) and (6), that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants' claims, and order Claimants to reimburse all of Bulgaria's costs46.\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 57.\n\n45.\n\nClaimants, in turn, ask the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent's Application in its entirety and to award Claimants all of their costs associated with defending Respondent's Application, with immediate effect47.\n\nClaimants' Answer, para. 46.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Respondent's Application should be dismissed because Claimants' claims are not \"manifestly without legal merit\".\n\n**1. The applicable standard**\n------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nFor the purpose of determining Respondent's Application, the relevant provision of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states as follow:\n\n\"**Rule 41**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(5) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\n\n(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect\".\n\n48.\n\nUnder Rule 41(5), the respondent in an arbitration may raise, at the outset of the proceedings, a preliminary objection that the claims brought by the claimant should be dismissed for being \"manifestly without legal merit\".\n\n49.\n\nThe tribunal, after giving claimant an opportunity to be heard, must promptly adopt a decision:\n\n- If the tribunal accepts respondent's objection, it will partially or totally dismiss claimant's claims;\n\n- If the tribunal rejects the objection, the main proceedings are resumed and respondent may raise the objections again in the normal course of the arbitration.\n\n50.\n\nFor an objection to succeed in this special procedure, respondent must prove that it refers to a claim that is \"manifestly without legal merit\". If the threshold is not reached, the tribunal dismisses the objection *pro tem*.\n\n\"Manifestly\"\n------------\n\n51.\n\nThe term \"manifestly\" generally means something that is \"evident\", \"clear\" or \"obvious\" to the observer. The word has been interpreted by a number of arbitral tribunals.\n\n52.\n\nFor example, the Decision on the Respondent's Objection Under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules of the tribunal in *Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* [\"***Trans-Global Petroleum***\"]48 analysed the use of the expression \"manifestly\" in other articles of the Convention and legal authorities, and arrived at the following conclusion49:\n\n\"[\u2026] the ordinary meaning of the word requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch. The standard is thus set high [\u2026] The exercise may thus be complicated; but it should never be difficult\".\n\n**RL-2**, *Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25, Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008.\n\n**RL-2**, *Trans-Global Petroleum*, para. 88.\n\n53.\n\nThe tribunal considered that \"the special procedure imposed by Rule 41(5)\" confirmed that meaning and went further to state that50:\n\n\"as a basic principle of procedural fairness, an award under Rule 41(5) can only apply to a clear and obvious case, [\u2026] [to] 'patently unmeritorious claims'\".\n\n**RL-2**, *Trans-Global Petroleum*, paras. 89, 92.\n\n54.\n\nThis conclusion was later endorsed in Global Trading Resource Corp. and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine [\"**Globex**\"]51, RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada [\"**RSM**\"]52 and Brandes Investment Partners, LP v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela [\"**Brandes**\"]53. In Brandes, the tribunal also made the following observation54:\n\n\"[T]he new procedure of the preliminary objections under Rule 41(5) is intended to create the possibility to dismiss at an early stage such cases which are clearly unmeritorious\".\n\n**RL-4**, *Global Trading Resource Corp. and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11, Award, 1 December 2010, para. 35.\n\n**RL-5**, *RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, para. 6.1.3.\n\n**RL-3**, *Brandes Investment Partners, LP v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/03, Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 2 February 2009, para. 62.\n\n**RL-3**, *Brandes*, para. 62.\n\n55.\n\nLikewise, in *Lotus v. Turkmenistan* [\"***Lotus***\"], the tribunal required that it be \"obvious from the submissions of the parties that there is some unavoidable and indisputable fact, or some legal objection in relation to which no possible counterargument is identified\". Therefore, \"[i]f the claimant [\u2026] can point to an arguable case, the claim should proceed\"55.\n\n**RL-8***, Lotus Holding Anonim \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/17/30, Award, 6 April 2020, para. 158.\n\n56.\n\nThe procedure established by Rule 41(5) is an expedited procedure, directed to cases that are \"evident\", \"clear\" or \"obvious\", not those which entail a greater degree of difficulty, or which require a more thorough and extensive analysis of the legal and factual issues to dispose of the claim. Rule 41(5) is thus intended to capture cases that are clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious, not those which are novel, difficult, refer to disputed legal issues, or where claimant has a tenable or arguable case. The standard is demanding and rigorous56.\n\n**CL-9***, PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Objections under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 28 October 2014*,* para. 88; **RL-1**, *Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2, Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection under Rule 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, 12 December 2016, para. 66.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore sees no reason to depart from the interpretations rendered under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) (and its parallel provision under Rule 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Additional Facility Rules) and adopts the same approach in this case.\n\n\"Without legal merit\"\n---------------------\n\n58.\n\nAccording to the language of Rule 41(5), the issue to be determined (*i.e*., what must be \"manifest\") is that a claim is \"without legal merit\". The term \"legal\" is used in Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in opposition to \"factual\" as shown by the drafting history of the provision: the Secretariat's Working Paper of May 2005 made reference to claims \"manifestly without merit\"57. The term \"legal\" was added thereafter in order to avoid inappropriate discussion on the facts of the case at that stage58. A preliminary objection must therefore relate to \"legal\" issues, not to matters of fact.\n\nWorking Paper of the ICSID Secretariat, *Suggested Changes to the ICSID Rules and Regulations* (May 21, 2005), p. 7.\n\nAur\u00e9lia Antonietti, *The 2006 Amendments of the ICSID Rules and Regulations and the Additional Facility Rules*, 21 ICSID Rev. \u2013 FILJ 427, 439, p. 440.\n\n59.\n\nThe tribunal in *Trans-Global Petroleum* emphasized the same idea59:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that the adjective 'legal' in Rule 41(5) is clearly used in contradistinction to 'factual' given the drafting genesis of Rule 41(5) [\u2026] Accordingly, it would seem that the tribunal is not concerned, *per se*, with the factual merits of the Claimant's three claims. At this early stage of these proceedings, without any sufficient evidence, the Tribunal is in no position to decide disputed facts alleged by either side in a summary procedure\".\n\n**RL-2**, *Trans-Global Petroleum,* para. 97.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore of the view that the expression \"without legal merit\" in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) limits the issues that can be addressed by the tribunal to legal considerations, as opposed to factual ones.\n\nObjections to jurisdiction v. objections to the merits\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nRule 41(5) does not specifically state whether objections must refer to the merits of the case, or whether jurisdictional objections are also admissible. The standard required by the Rule \u2013 that \"a claim is manifestly without legal merit\" \u2013 is ambiguous.\n\n62.\n\nBulgaria is submitting a jurisdictional objection: that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investor \u2013 Mr. Jer\u0161ov \u2013 did not consent to arbitrate any alleged dispute, his Heirs do not claim to be \"Investors\" that owned or controlled an \"investment\" in Bulgaria and, in any event, Claimants are not eligible to consent to submit the dispute to arbitration \"on behalf\" of the *de cujus*. Claimants, in turn, while rejecting the substance of Respondent's Application, have not disputed that Bulgaria is entitled to submit jurisdictional objections by way of the Rule 41(5) procedure.\n\n63.\n\nThe arbitral tribunals that have considered this question have arrived at the conclusion that jurisdictional objections are admissible under the Rule 41(5) procedure.\n\n64.\n\nFor example, the tribunal in *Brandes* was the first to decide the issue and came to the following conclusion60:\n\n\"The Tribunal first of all notes that Rule 41(5) does not mention 'jurisdiction'. The terms employed are 'legal merit'. This wording, by itself, does not provide a reason why the question whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to hear and decide a claim could not be included in the very general notion that the claim filed is 'without legal merit'.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nUntil 2006 the Rules therefore did not provide for any possibility to terminate the proceedings at an early stage in the case of requests which are patently unmeritorious. There exist no objective reasons why the intent not to burden the parties with a possibly long and costly proceeding when dealing with such unmeritorious claims should be limited to an evaluation of the merits of the case and should not also englobe an examination of the jurisdictional basis on which the tribunal's powers to decide the case rest\".\n\n**RL-3**, *Brandes,* paras. 50-52.\n\n65.\n\nSeveral tribunals were confronted with the same question, and all explicitly agreed with the findings of *Brandes*61.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nSee, for instance, **RL-4**, *Globex,* para. 30; **RL-5**, *RSM*, paras. 6.1.1. and 6.1.2; **CL-9**, *PNG,* para. 91.\n\n66.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, there seems to be a common ground among arbitral tribunals \u2013 which is confirmed by both Parties62 \u2013 as to the requirements of Rule 41(5)'s \"manifestly without legal merit\" standard. That is, that an objection under this provision:\n\n- Must be established clearly and obviously, with relative ease and dispatch;\n\n- Must raise a legal impediment to a claim, not a factual one; and\n\n- May go either to jurisdiction or the merits.\n\nRespondent's Application, paras. 9-12; Claimants' Answer, paras. 5-15.\n\nAdditional requirements\n-----------------------\n\n67.\n\nRule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules further requires that:\n\n- The Parties have not agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections;\n\n- The party raises the objection within 30 days of the Tribunal's constitution; and\n\n- In any case before the First Session.\n\n68.\n\nThe additional requirements established in Rule 41(5) are met in this case. It is undisputed that the Parties have not agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections and that Respondent submitted its Preliminary Objection63 within the timeframe of 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal64 and before the First Session65.\n\nRespondent submitted its Application on 30 May 2023.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 4 May 2023.\n\nThe First Session was held on 23 June 2023.\n\n**2. Application of the standard to Respondent's Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nIn its Rule 41(5) Application, Bulgaria alleges that Claimants' claims are manifestly without legal merit because:\n\n(i) Mr. Jer\u0161ov did not consent to arbitrate any alleged dispute;\n\n(ii) Claimants are not \"Investors\" who owned or controlled an \"Investment\" in Bulgaria under the ECT; and\n\n(iii) Claimants are not eligible under the ECT to submit a dispute \"on behalf\" of Mr. Jer\u0161ov or \"in his stead\".\n\n70.\n\nIn other words, Bulgaria submits that because Claimants are allegedly not entitled to bring the present case, for lack of legal standing, their claims are manifestly without legal merit.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal is unconvinced that, in the present case, it would be appropriate to summarily dismiss Claimants' claims for being manifestly without legal merit.\n\nConsent\n-------\n\n72.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes the requirements for the Centre's jurisdiction in the following terms:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [\u2026] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\".\n\n73.\n\nFurthermore, Article 26 ECT provides that:\n\n\"(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n[\u2026]\".\n\nTribunal's analysis\n-------------------\n\n74.\n\nFor Bulgaria's Rule 41(5) Application to be upheld, the Tribunal would have to find that there is a manifest case for the lack of standing of Claimants \u2013 as argued by Bulgaria in its objections.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants do not dispute that Mr. Jer\u0161ov passed away before having provided his consent to arbitration. Neither do they argue that they owned or controlled an \"Investment\" in Bulgaria at the time of Respondent's alleged breaches. From Claimants' standpoint, Bulgaria's breaches of its ECT obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* Mr. Jer\u0161ov created a right to bring an investment claim against Respondent. When Mr. Jer\u0161ov passed away, the right to bring such claim \u2013 which had fully crystallized by the time of Mr. Jer\u0161ov's death \u2013 was transferred to Claimants, as his legal Heirs. By way of this universal succession, Claimants are now eligible to consent to arbitration.\n\n76.\n\nThus, the main issue before the Arbitral Tribunal is not whether Mr. Jer\u0161ov has consented to ICSID arbitration, nor whether Claimants owned or controlled an \"Investment\" in Bulgaria at the time of Respondent's alleged breaches, but rather to assess whether Claimants have legal standing to bring investment claims on behalf of their late father.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of whether the heirs of an alleged investor who died before giving its consent to arbitration seems to be a rather novel issue, which has not been addressed in previous decisions studied by the Tribunal \u2013 the Parties' failure to submit case-law addressing this specific issue is revealing.\n\n78.\n\nAfter studying each Party's submissions, and examining carefully the evidence presented, the Tribunal considers that the questions at stake raise complex interpretative issues that require a greater degree of consideration and a more thorough analysis of Lithuanian law and international legal principles. The Tribunal requires further legal argument on these issues.\n\n79.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal considers that there is not a manifest case for a lack of legal standing and, therefore, that the Claimants' claims cannot be described as \"manifestly without legal merit\" on the basis of the record as it currently stands. This is not an appropriate case for the expedited Rule 41(5) procedure and therefore Respondent's Application must be dismissed.\n\nOther requests\n--------------\n\n80.\n\nFinally, Claimants have sought an award of costs. The Tribunal decides to reserve this issue for a future decision.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n81.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. Respondent's Application is dismissed;\n\n2. All questions as to the costs of the Respondent's Application are reserved to a future decision;\n\n3. All other requests are dismissed;\n\n4. The further procedure for this arbitration will be according to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 2, which the Tribunal will issue shortly\n\nOn behalf of the Tribunal, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 16(2),\n\nDate: 25 July 2023"}]}
