INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 September 2008, the Republic of Chile (the \"**Republic**\" or \"**Respondent**\") filed with the then Acting Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") an application (the \"**Application**\") requesting the annulment of an award rendered on 8 May 2008 in ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (the \"**Award**\") between Victor Pey Casado and the Fondation \"President Allende\" on one side (the \"**Claimants**\") and the Republic on the other side. The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Application and forwarded it to the Claimants on 10 September 2008.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was filed while the Award was the subject of a revision proceeding initiated by the Claimants on 2 June 2008. The revision application was registered on 17 June 2008. Further to the Republic's request of 16 July 2008, the Tribunal, composed of the same arbitrators who had drafted the Award, decided on 5 August 2008 to stay the enforcement of the Award pending its decision. The Tribunal rendered its Decision on 18 November 2009 and lifted the stay.\n\n3.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 6 July 2009 and transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties on that date. In that Notice, the Secretary-General noted that the Application contained a request for a provisional stay of the Award (the \"**Request**\") pursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**Convention**\") and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"). She further stated that: \"Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules provides that the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration of the application, inform the parties of the provisional stay of the award. I note, however, that in the context of the application for revision of the Arbitral Award, the enforcement of the Arbitral Award was stayed on August 5, 2008 by the Arbitral Tribunal before which the issue is currently pending.\"\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of December 2, 2009, the stay having been lifted by the Tribunal, the Republic asked the Centre to confirm that the execution of the Award was suspended pursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention providing that: \"If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\" The Acting Secretary-General confirmed, by letter of 4 December 2009, that pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee was constituted on 22 December 2009. In order to give the parties an opportunity to fully present their observations on the issue of the continuation of the stay of enforcement, and for the Committee to rule on this issue, the parties were asked on 6 January 2010 to file written observations by 15 January 2010 for the Respondent and by 25 January 2010 for the Claimants.\n\n6.\n\nThe parties complied with the prescribed time limits. Accordingly, the Republic filed its observations on 15 January 2010. It specifically referred to Arbitration Rule 54(2), second sentence, which provides that: \"As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\" Therefore, the Republic asked the Committee to affirmatively extend the stay until such time as it had heard the parties and reached a final determination on continuation of the stay. The Committee did so by letter of 21 January 2010. The Claimants submitted their response on 25 January 2010.\n\n7.\n\nThe parties were also given the opportunity to make oral presentations during the First Session, held in Paris on 29 January 2010.\n\n8.\n\nBy Decision of 4 May 2010, the Committee rejected the Claimants' request to declare the Application inadmissible.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn making its Request, the Republic has submitted as follows:\n\nAs far as the Republic is aware, no ICSID tribunal has ever refused to grant a stay of execution pending outcome of the annulment proceeding. Although neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules provide guidance on the type of circumstances that justify a stay under Article 52(5) of the Convention and Rule 54(1) and (2), annulment committees in past cases have identified the following factors as relevant: (i) prospects for compliance with the award; (ii) whether the party seeking the annulment is merely seeking to delay enforcement of the award, (iii) prospects for recoupment of the relevant payment if the award is subsequently annulled; and (iv) prejudice to Claimants by the delay in payment of the award. In the present case, each of these factors support a grant of stay of enforcement of the Award until issuance of the annulment decision.1 [footnotes omitted]\n\n*See* letter of 15 January 2010 from the Republic to Ms. Elo\u00efse Obadia at page 2.\n\n10.\n\nRegarding the prospects for compliance with the Award, the Republic argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\nThe recognition that the Republic approaches its obligations and the fulfillment of its national and international commitments and duties with faithfulness and utmost seriousness should itself constitute a sufficient assurance to the Committee and to the Claimants of the Republic's intention and commitment to honor any enforcement obligation in connection with the present case in an appropriate and timely fashion should the Republic's Annulment Application ultimately be rejected. As the Committee in *MTD v. Chile* held, \"As a general matter a respondent State seeking annulment should be entitled to a stay provided it gives reasonable assurances that the award, if not annulled, will be complied with.\"2 [footnote omitted]\n\n*Id.* at page 3.\n\n11.\n\nOn the issue of whether it is seeking to delay the enforcement of the Award, the Republic makes the following submission:\n\nIn fact, Chile itself has repeatedly sought to speed up the annulment proceeding, whereas it was the Claimants who caused the delay of a year and a half by filing a revision petition that was entirely baseless (which is likely why the decision was rendered in favor of Chile with costs).3 [footnote omitted]\n\n*Id.* at page 4.\n\n12.\n\nIn terms of prospects of recoupment, the Republic maintains as follows:\n\nIf a stay were denied, Chile were required to honor forthwith the Award, and then the Award were ultimately annulled, the Republic could end up in a situation in which it would have already paid the Award but would then need to recoup the relevant amount from the Claimants. The Republic submits that such recoupment would be very difficult if not impossible \u2013 an in any event, very costly \u2013 for the Republic. Chile believes the risk of dissipation of assets in the present case is high, and accordingly, so is the risk irreparable harm if a stay were denied. As the *MTD* Tribunal stated in granting Chile a stay, \"A respondent State \u2026 should not be exposed, while exercising procedural rights open to it under the Convention, to the risk that payment made under an award which is eventually annulled may turn out to be irrecoverable from an insolvent claimant.\" In this situation it would be entirely unfair for the Claimants to benefit from what would have amounted to a windfall in the event the Award were ultimately annulled.4 [footnote omitted]\n\n*Id.*\n\n13.\n\nFinally, the Republic submits that the Claimants would not be prejudiced by a stay:\n\nsince the Award provides for the granting of compound interest until the date of actual payment on the amount granted. In this regard, the MTD Committee held that \"\u2026 in the Committee's view Chile has demonstrated that MTD will not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other than in respect of the delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which can be remedied by the payment of interest in the event that the annulment application is unsuccessful.\"\n\nIn light of the foregoing, staying the award pending the annulment decision would, serve the goals of fairness, efficiency and practicality, by obligating Chile to execute the Award only in the event that Chile's annulment petition were denied. Chile submits that its public policy and conduct, along with its legal framework, provide adequate assurances with respect to the fulfillment of its international obligations, including that of arbitration awards and decisions.5 [footnote omitted]\n\n*Id.*\n\n14.\n\nIn response to the Republic's Request, the Claimants have taken the position that the Government of Chile cannot guarantee that the Republic will honor its obligations, and refer in this regard to delays relative to the intervention of various Chilean institutions, including the Parliament, the Chilean Executive and the Chilean General *Contralor*. In the words of the Claimants:\n\nLe pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif n'est donc pas en mesure de garantir que ces institutions de la R\u00e9publique du Chili ex\u00e9cuteront la Sentence, si elle \u00e9tait confirm\u00e9e.\n\nQuand bien m\u00eame, le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique du Chili prendrait un engagement solennel d'ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence, celui-ci ne serait pas suffisant compte tenu du r\u00f4le, l\u00e9galement \u00e9tabli, desdites institutions chiliennes, sur lesquelles le pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif n'a aucun contr\u00f4le l\u00e9gal ni politique.\n\nIl reste qu'\u00e0 ce jour aucune des institutions concern\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique du Chili n'a pris aucun engagement formel de ce qu'elle ex\u00e9cutera la Sentence, condition requise pour maintenir la suspension de l'ex\u00e9cution.6 [footnote omitted]\n\n*See* letter of 25 January 2010 from the Claimants to Ms. Elo\u00efse Obadia at page 3.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the Republic's Request is abusive. However, in the event a stay of the Award was ordered, the Claimants request that it be made conditional on the provision of some security, either by way of a sequestred account or an irrevocable bank guarantee. Regarding a sequestred account, the Claimants argue:\n\nCette mesure d\u00e9montrerait la volont\u00e9 sans \u00e9quivoque de la R\u00e9publique du Chili de respecter ses engagements internationaux en ex\u00e9cutant promptement la Sentence. Elle attesterait de la bonne foi de la R\u00e9publique du Chili en d\u00e9montrant que la demande en nullit\u00e9 n'a pas de caract\u00e8re abusif. Le paiement sur un compte s\u00e9questre prot\u00e9gerait \u00e9galement la R\u00e9publique du Chili du risque de non recouvrement \u00e9voqu\u00e9, sans fondement, dans la lettre du 15 janvier 2010. En outre, contrairement \u00e0 la mise en place d'une garantie bancaire, l'ouverture d'un compte s\u00e9questre aupr\u00e8s d'une banque n'a qu'un co\u00fbt n\u00e9gligeable largement compens\u00e9 par la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du compte s\u00e9questr\u00e9.7\n\n*Ibid.* at page 4.\n\n16.\n\nAnd regarding an irrevocable bank guarantee, the Claimants add:\n\nContrairement aux termes de la lettre du 15 janvier 2010, la mise en place d'une garantie n'a pas pour effet de placer les investisseurs espagnols dans une position plus favorable si l'Etat du Chili avait la volont\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter de bonne foi la Sentence, i.e. sans d\u00e9lai. D\u00e8s lors la mise en place d'une garantie vient simplement assurer le respect des engagements de l'Etat au titre de la Convention. C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'il ressort de l'analyse des d\u00e9cisions des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents Comit\u00e9s *ad hoc*, qui ont relev\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re essentiel qui s'opposait \u00e0 la mise en place d'une garantie \u00e9tait l'assurance de recouvrement sans d\u00e9lai du montant de la sentence si celle-ci n'\u00e9tait pas annul\u00e9e. Cette assurance n'existe pas dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et ne peut \u00eatre valablement donn\u00e9e par un repr\u00e9sentant du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif de la R\u00e9publique du Chili d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 vu les circonstances sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.8 [footnote omitted]\n\n*Ibid.* at page 5\n\n17.\n\nWith respect to the affirmation made by counsel for the Respondent at the First Session that Chile would honor the Award should it not be annulled, the Claimants stated that in view of the developments which took place in relation to the question of the admissibility of the Application, this commitment was not sufficient and some sort of security was required:\n\nEn effet, ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, qu'ils soient le r\u00e9sultat d'une absence totale de rigueur de l'administration chilienne, comme le pr\u00e9tend aujourd'hui la R\u00e9publique, ou de faits bien plus graves tels que nous les soup\u00e7onnons, d\u00e9montrent que, dans cette affaire, l'affirmation faite dans l'audience du 29 janvier 2010 par un conseil que la R\u00e9publique du Chili ex\u00e9cutera volontairement et sans d\u00e9lai la Sentence, si elle \u00e9tait confirm\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc*, n'est pas suffisant (sic) pour prononcer la suspension de l'ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence sans contrepartie.9\n\n*See* letter of 17 February 2010 from the Claimants to Ms. Elo\u00efse Obadia at page 6.\n\n**III. RELEVANT ICSID CONVENTION ARTICLES AND ICSID ARBITRATION RULES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nArticle 27(1) of the Convention states:\n\nNo Contracting State shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State shall have consented to submit or shall have submitted to arbitration under this Convention, unless such other Contracting State shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 52 of the Convention provides:\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n[*\u2026*]\n\n(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\n\n[*\u2026*]\n\n20.\n\nArticles 53 to 55 of the Convention provide:\n\n**Article 53**\n\n(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.\n\n**Article 54**\n\n(1) Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.\n\n(2) A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.\n\n(3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.\n\n**Article 55**\n\nNothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.\n\n21.\n\nRule 54 of the Arbitration Rules applies to the present case and provides:\n\n**Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\n\n**IV. THE COMMITTEE'S VIEWS**\n-----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Award in the present case was issued on 8 May 2008. On 2 June 2008, the Claimants filed an application for a partial revision of the Award. On 16 July 2008, the Republic requested a stay of enforcement of the Award which was granted by the Tribunal on 5 August 2008. On 18 November 2009, the Tribunal declared inadmissible the Claimants' application for revision and lifted the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 September 2008, the Republic filed its Application for Annulment of the Award and applied for a provisional stay of the enforcement of the Award pending the eventual decision of the *ad hoc* Committee to be constituted.\n\n24.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties of the provisional stay of the Award which stay was continued by the Committee on 21 January 2010 pursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention. The Republic now requests the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the Committee's decision on its Application. The Claimants oppose the continuation of the stay of enforcement.\n\n25.\n\nTurning first to the Republic's Request that the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued pending its decision on the Application, the Committee notes that, although Article 52(5) of the Convention uses the verb \"may\", thereby conveying an element of discretion to the Committee, a review of the many decisions by *ad hoc* annulment committees since the MINE decision in 198810 leads the Committee to the conclusion that, absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic.11\n\n*See Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Interim Order No. 1, 12 August 1988, 5 *ICSID Rev.* \u2014*FILJ* 129 (1990) (\"**MINE Stay Decision**\").\n\n*See Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 30 November 2004, 20 *ICSID Rev*.\u2014 *FILJ* 587 (2005), at para. 28, and *Enron v. Argentine Republic*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (7 October 2008) at para. 42 (\"**Enron Stay Decision**\").\n\n26.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee is satisfied that the Republic has discharged its burden of proving that there are no unusual circumstances and that all the factors which the Republic has referred to12 support the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the Committee's decision and it so rules.\n\n*See* letter of 15 January 2010 from Arnold & Porter, L.L.P. to Ms. Elo\u00efse Obadia and Transcript Hearing of 29 January 2010, pages 140 to 157 [English Transcripts].\n\n27.\n\nThe Committee will now turn to the Claimants' request that the stay be made conditional on the provision of some form of security by the Republic. In this connection, the Committee recalls the submission of the Claimants:\n\n[\u2026] les investisseurs espagnols ne s'opposent pas au maintien de la suspension de l'ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence, si, en contre partie, la R\u00e9publique du Chili prenait les mesures ad\u00e9quates suivantes -qui sont du ressort du seul pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif- permettant d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution effective et imm\u00e9diate de la Sentence d\u00e8s sa confirmation.\n\nLe versement des sommes dues par la R\u00e9publique du Chili au titre de la Sentence sur un compte s\u00e9questre, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat, d\u00e9tenu par une banque de premier rang domicili\u00e9e sur le territoire europ\u00e9en ou nord am\u00e9ricain, et qui pourra \u00eatre actionn\u00e9 par l'une ou l'autre des parties sur pr\u00e9sentation de la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* confirmant ou annulant la Sentence, serait une mesure ad\u00e9quate permettant de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de chacune des parties dans cette proc\u00e9dure.\n\n[\u2026] A titre subsidiaire, les investisseurs espagnols accepteraient en contrepartie de la suspension la mise en place d'une garantie bancaire irr\u00e9vocable, inconditionnelle et \u00e0 premi\u00e8re demande, \u00e9mise par une banque de premier rang, domicili\u00e9e en Europe ou sur le continent nord am\u00e9ricain, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des demandeurs pour le montant de la condamnation prononc\u00e9e dans la Sentence, soit la somme de 16,682,947,17US$ (date valeur 06-08-2008) plus int\u00e9r\u00eats de 5% compos\u00e9s annuellement commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 courir \u00e0 la date du 6 ao\u00fbt 2008, ou toute autre mesure \u00e9quivalente.13\n\n*See* letter of 25 January 2010 from the Claimants to Ms. Elo\u00efse Obadia at pages 4 and 5.\n\n28.\n\nWhile neither the Convention nor the Rules expressly states whether an *ad hoc* Committee can grant a request for a stay subject to conditions, such as a condition that the party seeking the stay provide security for the enforcement of the award in the event that annulment is not granted, the Committee, guided by Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**Vienna Convention**\") considers that a discretionary power to allow or deny a remedy \"may implicitly include a power to allow the remedy subject to conditions and that such an interpretation would be consistent with the objects and purposes of Article 52(5) [of the Convention], which is designed to enable the *ad hoc* Committee to balance the rights of the parties pending annulment proceedings\".14\n\n*See* Enron Stay Decision at para. 26.\n\n29.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, will now consider whether or not the stay should be subject to a condition of security. The Claimants bear the burden of proving that security should be ordered and that, if it is not ordered, they will suffer a prejudice.\n\n30.\n\nThe Committee starts from the premise that the primary security for the Claimants' Award is provided through the obligations the Republic of Chile has assumed under Article 54 of the Convention. In addition, the Committee notes that the Republic's constitutional and municipal law enforcement regimes are in conformity with the Convention.15\n\n*See* *Azurix Corporation v. Argentine Republic*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (28 December 2007), para. 33 (\u2015 **Azurix** \"); see also *MTD v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), *Ad hoc* Committee's Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Continued Stay of Execution (1 June 2005), paras. 32 *et seq.* (\u2015 **MTD Stay Decision** \").\n\n31.\n\nThe Republic has represented that it has always complied with its international payment obligations and with all judgments or awards of international courts and tribunals. Through its authorized representative, it affirmed before the Committee that it will do so in the present case if the Award is confirmed.16\n\nTranscript of 29 January 2010 at page 157, Mr. Di Rosa [English Transcripts].\n\n32.\n\nIt is a fact that, because of the Application, the satisfaction of the Award (assuming that the Application is unsuccessful) will be delayed. In the view of the Committee that is the only prejudice which the Claimants can point to. But, the provision for compound interest in the \"dispositif\" of the Award compensates the Claimants adequately for the delay.17 As the Azurix *ad hoc* Committee said, after quoting Article 53(1) of the Convention:18 \"\u2026 if an *ad hoc* Committee considers, as we do, that the circumstances require a stay, then the award creditor's rights are themselves qualified by the Convention. \"19 (emphasis in the original)\n\n*See, inter alia, Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (20 August 2007) at para. 40; and MTD Stay Decision at para. 36.\n\nArticle 53(1): \u2015The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\"\n\n*See* Azurix at para. 42\n\n33.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Republic has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Committee that the Claimants will not be prejudiced by the grant of the stay save in respect of the delay which is incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which will be remedied by the payment of compound interest if the annulment application is unsuccessful.\n\n34.\n\nThere is an additional reason why the Committee has decided not to require the Republic to provide a guarantee, particularly a guarantee such as the Claimants propose in the present case, as a condition to the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award. Not only would the posting of such a guarantee at this time place the Claimants in a much more favourable position than it enjoyed prior to the provisional stay, but it could also prevent the Republic from opposing a legal defense of sovereign immunity under Article 55 of the Convention20 if, in the event the application was unsuccessful, forcible execution of the Award was resorted to by the Claimants. In the words of the MINE *ad hoc* annulment Committee, to which the Committee subscribes: \"such a one-sided change in the relative position of the parties is [not] justified.\"21 It would truly be a form of conditional payment in advance.\n\nArticle 55 of the Convention: \"Nothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.\"\n\n*See* MINE Stay Decision at para. 22 and paras 23-25\n\n**V.

THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS**\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 September 2008, the Republic of Chile (the **\"Republic\"** or **\"Respondent\"** or **\"Chile\"**) filed with the then Acting Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\"**) an application (the **\"Application\"**) requesting the annulment of an award rendered on 8 May 2008 in ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (the **\"Award\"**) between Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation \"Presidente Allende\" on one side (the **\"Claimants\"**) and the Republic on the other side. The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Application and forwarded it to the Claimants on 10 September 2008.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was filed while the Award was the subject of a revision proceeding initiated by the Claimants on 2 June 2008. The revision application was registered on 17 June 2008 and the Tribunal, composed of the same arbitrators who had rendered the Award, issued its decision on 18 November 2009 dismissing the application for revision.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of 18 September 2008, the Claimants argued that the Application filed by the Republic was inadmissible as it had been filed in English while the languages of the original arbitration proceeding and the pending revision proceeding were French and Spanish. By letters of 8 October and 22 October 2008, the Claimants reiterated their submission that the Application was inadmissible on the additional ground that the Application had not been signed by the agents designated by the Republic of Chile before ICSID.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 6 July 2009 and transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties on that date. In her transmittal letter, the Secretary-General indicated that she would refuse to register an application for annulment only if the conditions set forth in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"**) were not met and that her registration of the Application was without prejudice to the powers of the *ad hoc* Committee under Articles 41 and 42 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\"**) with respect to jurisdiction and the merits.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General noted that the Application contained a request for a provisional stay of the Award (the **\"Request\"**) pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules. The Secretary-General further stated that: \"Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules provides that the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration of the application, inform the parties of the provisional stay of the award. I note, however, that in the context of the application for revision of the Arbitral Award, the enforcement of the Arbitral Award was stayed on August 5, 2008 by the Arbitral Tribunal before which the issue is currently pending\".\n\n6.\n\nFurther to the issuance of the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s decision on the revision on 18 November 2009, the Republic requested, on 2 December 2009, that the Centre appoint an *ad hoc* Committee and confirm the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules. By letter of 8 December 2009, the Claimants argued that the Republic\u2019s request was inadmissible for the same reasons as those raised in connection with the Application.\n\n7.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties of the provisional stay of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee composed of Professor Piero Bernardini (a national of Italy), Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri (a national of Egypt) and Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., (a national of Canada) was constituted on 22 December 2009. The parties were notified that Ms. Eloise Obadia, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. By letter of 4 January 2010, the Secretary informed the parties that the Committee had designated Mr. L. Yves Fortier as President of the Committee.\n\n9.\n\nThe Committee invited the parties to submit further written observations on the issue of admissibility and the stay of enforcement of the Award which stay was continued by the Committee on 21 January 2010 pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. The parties were also given the opportunity to make oral presentations on these questions during the First Session, held in Paris on 29 January 2010. The parties filed further written observations on the question of admissibility after the First Session.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the First Session, the parties approved the appointment of by Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault of Ogilvy Renault (as it then was), an associate of the President, as assistant to the Committee. Ms. Th\u00e9riault ceased her functions on 24 December 2011. The parties also reached an agreement on the procedural languages: the Claimants would file their submissions in French and submit a Spanish translation within 15 days of the filing whereas the Respondent would file its submissions in English and submit a Spanish translation within 15 days of the filing. The parties agreed that all decisions of the Committee would be issued in the three official languages of the Centre.\n\n11.\n\nOn 4 May 2010, the *ad hoc* Committee issued a Decision rejecting the Claimants\u2019 Request to declare inadmissible the Republic\u2019s Application for the Annulment of the Award (the Decision was transmitted to the parties on 6 May 2010).\n\n12.\n\nOn 5 May 2010, the *ad hoc* Committee issued a Decision on the Republic of Chile\u2019s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award continuing the stay of the enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the Application for Annulment (the Decision was transmitted to the parties on 7 May 2010).\n\n13.\n\nOn 8 June 2010, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order N\u00b0 1 concerning the procedural calendar for the Parties to file their submissions. In accordance with that calendar, the Republic of Chile filed its memorial on annulment on 10 June 2010 **(\"Resp. Mem. Annulment\").** Victor Pey Casado and Presidente Allende Foundation filed a counter-memorial on 15 October 2010 **(\"Cl. C-Mem. Annulment\").** Chile filed its reply on 22 December 2010 **(\"Resp. Rep. Annulment\").** Victor Pey Casado and Presidente Allende Foundation filed their rejoinder on 28 February 2011 **(\"Cl. Rej. Annulment\").**\n\n14.\n\nOn 18 April 2011, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order N\u00b0 2 concerning various procedural matters, including the maintenance of the hearing dates and admissibility of evidence and a request to the parties to refrain from publishing or disclosing sensitive documents pertaining to the annulment proceeding.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 May 2011, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order N\u00b0 3 concerning further procedural matters including confirmation of the hearing dates, admissibility of evidence and amending Procedural Order N\u00b0 2.\n\n16.\n\nOn 27 May 2011, the parties filed Pre-Hearing Skeletons **(\"Cl. Pre-H. Skel\"** and **\"Resp. Pre-H. Skel.\")**\n\n17.\n\nThe hearing was held in Paris on 7 and 8 June 2011.\n\n18.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the President closed the oral phase of the proceedings, and indicated that the *ad hoc* Committee would notify the parties through the Secretariat when it had reached its Decision.\n\n19.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee then deliberated by various means of communication, including at meetings in Paris on 8 June 2011 and 29 September 2011. On 23 June 2012, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 28(2), the Committee invited the parties to submit their respective statements of costs by 6 July 2012. The Claimants did so on 6 July 2012 and the Republic, with the approval of the Committee, filed its statement of costs on 13 July 2012.\n\n20.\n\nOn 23 June 2012, the proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Rules 53 and 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In accordance with Rules 53 and 46 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Committee, by letter of 21 October 2012, extended by 60 days the period to draw up and sign its Decision in the three official languages of the Centre.\n\n**II. THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nAs will be seen, this has been a very protracted arbitral proceeding. The factual matrix consists of events which span more than four decades and the procedural history before ICSID commenced in October 1997. The Award of the Tribunal was issued on 8 May 2008.\n\n22.\n\nChile, in its Memorial on Annulment, has presented a summary of what it avers constitutes the relevant matrix to its challenge of the Award, including both the historical background and the procedural history of the case. This summary is characterized by Chile as being undisputed by the parties, except where otherwise noted.1 The Committee finds this summary very helpful in contextualizing Chile\u2019s Application and thus will reproduce it:\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 18.\n\n**A. Historical Background**\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nChile summarizes the factual matrix of its dispute with the Claimants as follows.2 The Committee agrees that this summary is accurate.\n\n19. **Mr. Victor Pey Casado** was bom in Spain in 1915. He has been **a Spanish national** from birth and throughout his life. This issue was not in controversy in the arbitration, the principal disagreement between the parties being whether or not he had been a Chilean national on certain critical dates for ICSID jurisdictional purposes.\n\n20. Mr. Pey **moved to Chile** at the age of 24, in 1939, and **resided in Chile** for 34 years until 1973. During that time he married a Chilean and had children in Chile. In 1958 he applied to obtain the **Chilean nationality by nationalization,** which was conferred upon him in December 1958.\n\n21. In 1970, **Mr. Salvador Allende,** who was a friend of Mr. Pey, became President of Chile.\n\n22. Throughout his decades of residence in Chile, Mr. Pey had had several different jobs, but in the early 70\u2019s he became associated with a **Chilean newspaper called \"El Clar\u00edn.\"** This newspaper, which had been created and was owned for many years by a well-known figure in the Chilean media named **Dario Sainte-Marie,** was controlled by a company called **Consorcio Period\u00edstico y Publicitario, S.A. (\"CPP\"),** through a wholly owned subsidiary of CPP called **Empresa Period\u00edstica Clar\u00edn, Ltda. (\"EPC\").**\n\n23. \"El Clar\u00edn\" had a left-leaning political orientation and was one of the principal media supporters of President Allende, who was a socialist. Mr. Pey became a key figure in the **management of \"El Clar\u00edn\"** during the 1972-1973 time frame. (This too was not in dispute; rather, the main area of disagreement between the parties was whether Mr. Pey had ever been an *owner* of CPP).\n\n24. The 1972-1973 time period was one of very intense political and ideological turmoil in Chile. On **11 September 1973,** President Allende was overthrown in a **coup d\u2019\u00e9tat** led by General Augusto Pinochet. That same day, military troops occupied the **physical premises of \"El Clar\u00edn,\"** seizing papers located in Mr. Pey\u2019s office there. The property thereafter remained under complete control by the military (and was subsequently **confiscated formally by means of Decree No. 165 in 1975).**\n\n25. Soon after the 1973 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, **Mr. Pey moved to Venezuela and thereafter to** Spain, where he resided until at least **1989,** which was the year of the **return of democracy in Chile** following 16 years of military government.\n\n26. Upon his return to Chile, Mr. Pey applied for and obtained from the Chilean Government **benefits for returning Chilean political exiles.**\n\n27. In **1991,** the **Chile-Spain bilateral investment treaty (\"BIT\")** was signed.\n\n28. In **1994,** the **Chile-Spain BIT entered into** force.\n\n29. In 1995, Mr. Pey filed in the First Civil Court in Santiago a request for compensation for the confiscation of a Goss printing machine that was on the \"El Clar\u00edn\" premises when the property was seized by the military. This claim is referred to hereinafter as **\"the Goss machine case.\"**\n\n30. On 23 July 1998, Chile promulgated **Law No. 19,568,** which was designed to compensate those persons who had suffered confiscations of property at the hands of the military government through an administrative process. After being informed of his right to recover under this law, in a letter dated **24 June 1999,** Mr. Pey expressly **waived his right to seek compensation under Law 19,568** for the expropriation of the CPP and EPC.\n\n31. On **28 April 2000,** the Chilean Ministry of National Assets issued **Decision 43,** in which it authorized compensation to four individuals (or, as applicable, their heirs) for the expropriation of CPP and EPC, as such individuals had proven to the satisfaction of the Ministry to be the genuine owners of those companies. These individuals were: **Dario Sainte-Marie, Ram\u00f3n Carrasco, Emilio Gonz\u00e1lez and Jorge Venegas.**\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 19-31.\n\n**B. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n24.\n\nChile\u2019s summary of the arbitration proceedings follows.3 The Committee agrees that this summary is accurate.\n\n33. **Mr. Pey consented to ICSID arbitration** by means of a letter dated **2 October 1997,** addressed to the Chilean Government. This was the first of the two \"critical dates\" relevant to the ICSID Convention\u2019s nationality-related jurisdictional requirements for claimants who are natural persons (set forth in Article 25(2)(a)). Mr. Pey filed his **arbitration request** at ICSID on **7** November **1997. The request was registered on 20 April 1998,** which was the second critical date.\n\n34. The **first Tribunal** was constituted with **Mr. Francisco Rezek** as President, **Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui** (appointed by the Claimants) and **Mr. Jorge Witker** (appointed by Chile). Following a challenge to Mr. Witker by the Claimants, he resigned, and Chile named **Mr. Galo Leoro Franco** in his place.\n\n35. **Between 1998 and 2000,** the parties held a round of **jurisdictional written pleadings and a jurisdictional hearing.** Only days after the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations had concluded, the Claimants submitted a letter dated **12 March 2001,** in which **Claimants asked Mr. Rezek to resign,** on the basis that he had improperly admitted into evidence certain documents submitted by Chile at the jurisdictional hearing (and therefore, according to the Claimants, out of time). **Mr. Rezek resigned the very next day, on 13 March 2001.** In his resignation letter, Mr. Rezek denied the Claimants\u2019 allegation but resigned anyway, invoking the \"loss of confidence\" in him by one of the Parties.\n\n36. Mr. Rezek was succeeded by **Mr. Pierre Lalive,** who asked that an entirely new round of written submissions be made on the jurisdictional issues. This was done in the 2000-2001 timeframe. Also during that timeframe, the Claimants submitted a provisional measures request, asking the Tribunal to stay the execution of Decision 43. The request was rejected by the Tribunal in a **Provisional Measures Decision** dated **25 September 2001,** in part on the basis that Decision 43 could not affect the Claimants\u2019 rights since it did not involve the Claimants but rather third parties.\n\n37. On **8 May 2002,** the Tribunal headed by Mr. Lalive issued its jurisdictional decision, in which it declined to rule on Chile\u2019s objections, and instead **joined the jurisdictional issues to the merits.** The merits phase thus was resumed as of that date.\n\n38. Between January and April 2003 the parties exchanged written pleadings on jurisdiction and the merits, culminating in a **hearing on jurisdiction and merits held in Washington in May 2003.**\n\n39. The Tribunal thereafter failed to issue its Award for well over two years. In **August 2005,** following certain reports made by Mr. Leoro Franco to a Chilean official (who was not involved in the arbitration) concerning irregularities in the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations, **Chile challenged all three arbitrators** on the Tribunal. On **26 August 2005,** Mr. **Leoro Franco resigned,** citing as a motive only the loss of confidence of one of the parties.\n\n40. On **21 February 2006, Mr. Bedjaoui was disqualified** by ICSID (the first and only disqualification in ICSID history). Thereafter, the Claimants named **Mr. Mohammed Chemloul. Mr. Emmanuel Gaillard** was named as the third arbitrator (by ICSID, because Mr. Leoro\u2019s co-arbitrators had not accepted his resignation, as a result of which under the applicable ICSID rules, the Centre designates the replacement of the resigning arbitrator). Thus, on **14 July 2006, the Tribunal was reconstituted,** with Messrs. Lalive (President), Chemloul, and Gaillard.\n\n41. On **16 August 2006,** the Republic sent a letter to the Tribunal in which, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s constitution with two new members, it set forth a **request for new written submissions and a hearing on all issues** (both jurisdictional and merits-related). This request was rejected and prompted a series of exchanges between the parties and the Tribunal, the net result of which was a **complete rejection by the Tribunal of Chile\u2019s** proposal for new written submissions, and a decision to authorize only a jurisdictional hearing of limited scope, circumscribed to five specific jurisdictional questions circulated by the Tribunal to the parties. The Republic asked that the scope be broadened to other issues, but the Tribunal rejected that request as well. The **jurisdictional hearing** was held on **5-6 January 2007,** in Paris.\n\n42. Almost a year and a half later, on **8 May 2008,** the Tribunal issued its Award.\n\n43. On **2 June 2008,** the Claimants submitted a **Request for Revision** of the 8 May 2008 Award, invoking certain alleged new facts that in the Claimants\u2019 view justified having the Tribunal elevate the amount of the damages awarded to US$ 797 million (up from the figure of over US$ 500 million they had requested in their Arbitration Request, and from the revised figure of almost US$ 400 million cited in their 2003 Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Jurisdiction).\n\n44. On **5 September 2008,** the Republic filed its **Annulment Request.**\n\n45. On **18 November 2009,** the Revision Proceeding Tribunal (composed of the same arbitrators as the panel that issued the Award) issued its **Revision Decision,** in which it denied the Claimants\u2019 request in its entirety, and moreover awarded costs to the Republic. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid*. at paras. 33-45.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S AWARD**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Jurisdiction With Regards to Mr. Pey Casado**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Investment**\n------------------\n\n25.\n\nAfter an extensive review of the oral and documentary evidence as well as the parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal concluded that Mr. Pey Casado, in 1972, purchased all the shares of Consorcio Period\u00edstico y Publicitario S.A. **(\"CPP\")** which owned all the shares of Empresa Period\u00edstica Clar\u00edn Ltda. **(\"EPC\")** and that this acquisition constituted an investment for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n26.\n\nThe pertinent findings of the Tribunal in respect of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s investment are the following:\n\n180. [...] Apr\u00e8s un examen attentif des arguments et des pi\u00e8ces soumises par les parties, le Tribunal, dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des preuves, est parvenu \u00e0 la conclusion que M. Pey Casado a achet\u00e9 l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A. au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1972. Cette conclusion repose sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments principaux que sont la conclusion de ce que les parties appellent les \u00ab *Protocoles d\u2019Estoril \u00bb,* compl\u00e9t\u00e9s par ce qu\u2019elles appellent le \u00ab *Document de Gen\u00e8ve \u00bb,* les versements effectu\u00e9s au profit de M. Dar\u00edo Sainte Marie pour un montant total de 1.28 million USD et la remise \u00e0 M. Pey Casado, en plusieurs paquets, des titres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9s de leurs formulaires de transfert sign\u00e9s en blanc.\n\n[...]\n\n196. Au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, le Tribunal est en mesure de conclure que M. Pey Casado a effectivement fait l\u2019acquisition, pour la somme de 1.28 million USD, de la totalit\u00e9 des titres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A., qui elle-m\u00eame poss\u00e9dait l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du capital de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 EPC Ltda.\n\n[...]\n\n229. Le Tribunal conclut que, au moment o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e la saisie du journal El Clar\u00edn, M. Pey Casado devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le seul propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9gitime des actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A.\n\n[...]\n\n233. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les trois conditions qui commandent la qualification de l\u2019investissement, l\u2019existence d\u2019un apport, le fait que cet apport porte sur une certaine dur\u00e9e et qu\u2019il comporte, pour celui qui le fait, certains risques, sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence satisfaites.\n\na) M. Pey Casado a en effet apport\u00e9 ses propres capitaux afin d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les entreprises CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda. Il leur a \u00e9galement apport\u00e9 son savoir-faire d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur et s\u2019est impliqu\u00e9 dans la gestion du journal en assumant les fonctions de pr\u00e9sident du conseil d\u2019administration de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A.\n\nb) M. Pey Casado a effectu\u00e9 son investissement pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, au moins pour plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Le fait que les titres des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda et leurs biens ait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis ne saurait s\u00e9rieusement \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 [ ] pour conclure que la condition de dur\u00e9e n\u2019est pas satisfaite en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n\nc) Enfin, l\u2019acquisition et l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un journal, certes largement diffus\u00e9, est une op\u00e9ration pr\u00e9sentant certains risques, le secteur d\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9tant marqu\u00e9[] d\u2019une forte sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 et le contexte \u00e9conomique et politique de l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e9tant incertain.\n\n[...]\n\n235. Le Tribunal conclut des d\u00e9veloppements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent que la condition d\u2019investissement au sens de l\u2019article 25 de la Convention CIRDI est bien satisfaite en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n\n**(2) Nationality**\n-------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal then inquired whether, for purposes of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, Mr. Pey Casado, on the two \"critical dates\" of 2 October 1997 and 20 April 1998, had dual nationalities, that of Spain and that of Chile since, if he did, he would be expressly excluded from the scope of the ICSID Convention.\n\n28.\n\nAfter having summarized the debated questions which it had to determine, the Tribunal said:\n\n252. [...] Les seules questions d\u00e9cisives en \u2019l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont celles de savoir si, aux dates critiques, il avait conserv\u00e9 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, comme le pr\u00e9tend la d\u00e9fenderesse dans son exception d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence, ou si, comme l\u2019opposent les parties demanderesses, il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 ou y avait renonc\u00e9 valablement.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to analyze the law applicable to the question of nationality and concluded :\n\n260. [...] c\u2019est en appliquant le droit chilien que doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e la question de savoir si en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes ont, comme il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9, priv\u00e9 M. Pey Casado de sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, ou bien, s\u2019il s\u2019av\u00e8re que tel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, si M. Pey Casado a valablement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to inquire whether Mr. Pey Casado was deprived of or renounced his Chilean nationality prior to the two critical dates. The Tribunal concluded that Mr. Pey Casado was not deprived of his Chilean nationality.4\n\nSee Award at para. 274.\n\n31.\n\nAfter having found that Mr. Pey Casado \"demeurait double national espagnol/chilien jusqu\u2019en 1997\"5 the Tribunal addressed the crucial question whether \"comme il Ta all\u00e9gu\u00e9, M. Pey Casado a valablement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne par ses d\u00e9clarations faites en 1997, ce qui est contest\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u00e9fendeur.\"6\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 285.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 286 (emphasis in Award).\n\n32.\n\nAfter an exhaustive review of Chilean law on this question and an analysis of the expert evidence adduced by the parties, the Tribunal concluded:\n\n307. De l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019est pas parvenue \u00e0 apporter une d\u00e9monstration convaincante de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, en droit chilien, d\u2019une renonciation volontaire \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, en l\u2019absence de textes pr\u00e9cis et de jurisprudence pertinente.\n\n[...]\n\n322. Il revient donc au Tribunal arbitral d\u2019appr\u00e9cier le contenu et les effets du droit chilien sur la nationalit\u00e9 et de l\u2019appliquer au cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ce faisant, le Tribunal est conduit \u00e0 conclure de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une renonciation volontaire \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne lorsque la partie renon\u00e7ant est double nationale, renonciation dont la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e par la premi\u00e8re partie demanderesse.\n\n323. Aussi pour les raisons indiqu\u00e9es ci-dessus, le Tribunal arbitral estime n\u2019\u00eatre pas en mesure d\u2019admettre l\u2019exception d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la premi\u00e8re partie demanderesse poss\u00e9derait, \u00e0 la date pertinente, la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne.\n\n**(3) Consent**\n---------------\n\n(i) *Investment Under the BIT*\n------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal sought to determine whether, under the terms of the Spain/Chile BIT, Chile had consented to the arbitration of its dispute with Mr. Pey Casado.\n\n34.\n\nThere ensued a lengthy dissertation by the Tribunal with respect to the relevant Articles of the BIT, particularly Articles 1(2) and 2. It then opined as follows:\n\n368. La formulation de l\u2019article 1(2) refl\u00e8te une conception large de la notion d\u2019investissement. Le Tribunal constate d\u2019embl\u00e9e que l\u2019achat des titres de CPP S.A. et d\u2019EPC Ltda est couvert par la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019investissement \u00e9tablie par l\u2019article 1(2) qui consid\u00e8re comme un investissement les \u00ab *actions et autres formes de participation dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s* \u00bb. La seule condition pos\u00e9e par cet article est celle de l\u2019acquisition en conformit\u00e9 au droit de l\u2019Etat d\u2019accueil.\n\n369. L\u2019article 2(2) pr\u00e9cise que les investissements effectu\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019API ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront de la protection de l\u2019API que s\u2019ils peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s d\u2019investissements \u00e9trangers au sens de la l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019Etat d\u2019accueil. Le Tribunal estime que la l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 laquelle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence l\u2019API est la l\u00e9gislation chilienne en vigueur au moment auquel l\u2019investissement est r\u00e9alis\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en 1972.\n\n370. Pour que l\u2019API soit applicable \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en 1972, il est n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019op\u00e9ration litigieuse corresponde \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019investissement \u00e9tablie par l\u2019article 1(2) de l\u2019API et qu\u2019elle ait la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019investissement \u00e9tranger au sens de la l\u00e9gislation chilienne appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal then found:\n\n375. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les articles 1(2) et 2(2) ne posent pas de difficult\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Le pr\u00e9ambule, compos\u00e9 de trois brefs paragraphes et r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, refl\u00e8te essentiellement le souhait de cr\u00e9er des conditions favorables \u00e0 l\u2019investissement entre les deux Etats parties. Il est clair que ces trois paragraphes ne contiennent aucune disposition de fond susceptible de cr\u00e9er des conditions suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l\u2019octroi de la protection offerte par l\u2019API. Si le Tribunal acceptait l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9fenderesse, il consacrerait une interpr\u00e9tation particuli\u00e8rement restrictive du terme investissement au sens des articles 1(2) et 2(2) de l\u2019API allant contre la lettre et l\u2019esprit du pr\u00e9ambule. Une telle d\u00e9marche serait de toute \u00e9vidence contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 31 de la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des trait\u00e9s.\n\n[...]\n\n379. Il est clair, en revanche, que les articles 1(2) et 2(2) de l\u2019API exigent de l\u2019investisseur qu\u2019il effectue un investissement qui soit conforme \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation chilienne en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et, s\u2019agissant d\u2019investissements existant au moment de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9, qui puisse \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019investissement \u00e9tranger au sens de cette l\u00e9gislation.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal then set out Chile\u2019s last argument on this issue:\n\n380. La d\u00e9fenderesse a concentr\u00e9 son argumentation sur la D\u00e9cision n\u00b024 dont elle affirme qu\u2019elle est entr\u00e9e en vigueur au Chili le 30 juin 1971, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait applicable et effectivement appliqu\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e par l\u2019investissement \u00e9tranger que M. Pey Casado pr\u00e9tend avoir r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en 1972.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed Chile\u2019s argument and concluded categorically that Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s investment met the criteria of the BIT. It stated:\n\n411. Au vu de l\u2019ensemble des d\u00e9veloppements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas, dans le droit chilien en vigueur en 1972, de d\u00e9finition \u00e9tablie de l\u2019investissement \u00e9tranger et que l\u2019op\u00e9ration r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par M. Pey Casado s\u2019est conform\u00e9e au droit chilien qui lui \u00e9tait applicable. En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l\u2019investissement de M. Pey Casado, l\u2019achat d\u2019actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chilienne du secteur de la presse au moyen de paiements en devises \u00e9trang\u00e8res effectu\u00e9s sur des comptes bancaires en Europe, satisfait les conditions pos\u00e9es par l\u2019API et plus particuli\u00e8rement par ses articles 1(2) et 2(2).\n\n(ii) *Nationality Under the BIT*\n--------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAfter referring to the definition of \"investor\" in Article 1 of the BIT, the Tribunal had no difficulty in concluding that Mr. Pey Casado \"remplit la condition de la nationalit\u00e9 au sens de TAPF\".7\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 418.\n\n39.\n\nPreviously, the Tribunal had concluded:\n\n416. Dans le cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il suffit pour M. Pey Casado de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait la nationalit\u00e9 espagnole au moment de l\u2019acceptation de la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal arbitral sur le fondement de l\u2019API et, pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection de fond du trait\u00e9, au moment de la ou des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de l\u2019API. Comme on l\u2019a vu dans les d\u00e9veloppements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, cette condition est satisfaite.\n\n(iii) *Jurisdiction* \"Ratione Temporis\" *under the BIT*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal established that the investor\u2019s 1972 investment in Chile \"est couvert par l\u2019API\"8 under Article 2(2).\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 432.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal then inquired whether the three disputes arose after the entry into force of the BIT on 29 March 1994. According to the investor, the first one occurred in 1995, the second in 2000 and the third in 2002.\n\n42.\n\nIn turn, the Tribunal, after having reviewed the evidence and made reference to prior ICSID cases dealing with the issue of how to determine the date on which a dispute crystalizes for purposes of assessing whether it falls under a BIT providing consent to ICSID jurisdiction, ruled affirmatively that the three disputes crystallized after the entry into force of the BIT and that it was thus competent *\"ratione temporis\".* It found:\n\n446. Le Tribunal en conclut que le diff\u00e9rend est n\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e [en] vigueur du Trait\u00e9, les parties n\u2019ayant pas exprim\u00e9 et oppos\u00e9 leurs diff\u00e9rences de vues avant Tann\u00e9e 1995. Les demanderesses ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu\u2019il fallait distinguer le diff\u00e9rend et les faits \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend. Le Tribunal partage cette analyse. Comme Ta r\u00e9cemment rappel\u00e9 le tribunal arbitral constitu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire *Duke Energy, \u00ab What is decisive of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction* ratione temporis *is the point in time at which the instant legal dispute between the parties arose, not the point in time during which the factual matters on which the dispute is based took place.*\n\n[...]\n\n453. Au vu des pr\u00e9tentions respectives des parties expos\u00e9es ci-dessus, le Tribunal estime sans h\u00e9sitation que l\u2019opposition qui s\u2019est manifest\u00e9e entre les parties lors des audiences de mai 2000, d\u00e8s que les parties demanderesses ont pris connaissance de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043, est constitutive d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend. L\u00e0 encore, le diff\u00e9rend \u00e9tant survenu post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9, la condition de comp\u00e9tence *ratione temporis* est satisfaite.\n\n[...]\n\n464. Le Tribunal estime que le dernier diff\u00e9rend entre les parties, s\u2019est cristallis\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode 2002-2003. Avec l\u2019introduction de leur demande compl\u00e9mentaire le 4 novembre 2002, les demanderesses ont, pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans cette proc\u00e9dure, reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Etat chilien un d\u00e9ni de justice et ainsi formul\u00e9 une r\u00e9clamation. C\u2019est en demandant au Tribunal arbitral dans son m\u00e9moire du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2003 de rejeter la demande compl\u00e9mentaire des demanderesses que la d\u00e9fenderesse a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend sur la question du d\u00e9ni de justice.\n\n(iv) *Fork-in-the-Road Provision in the BIT*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nWith respect to its jurisdiction over Mr. Pey Casado, it then remained for the Tribunal to determine whether the investor, in the light of Article 10 of the BIT, had breached that fork-in-the-road provision by instituting a claim before the courts of Chile.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal then recalled the triple identity test and concluded categorically:\n\n486. Si l'un des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la triple identit\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e ci-dessus fait d\u00e9faut, la clause d\u2019option irr\u00e9vocable ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e. Or, cette triple identit\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n\n(v) *Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal thus dismissed the challenge of Chile to its jurisdiction over Mr. Pey Casado. It said, in conclusion:\n\n500. D\u00e8s lors, le Tribunal arbitral ne peut que rejeter l\u2019exception qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse et admettre sa comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur le fond du litige pour ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re partie demanderesse, M. Pey Casado.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Jurisdiction With Regards to the Foundation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Investment**\n------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal first recalled that the *\"Fundaci\u00f3n Presidente Allende\"* was constituted under Spanish law with its head-office in Spain by Mr. Pey Casado on 6 October 1989.\n\n47.\n\nAfter having examined the evidence, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n525. De l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, la Fondation a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en possession de 90% des actions de CPP S.A., qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises par M. Pey Casado au moyen d\u2019\u00e9critures pass\u00e9es entre le 6 octobre 1989 et le 27 mai 1990. Cette transmission a \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaite \u00e0 la date de l\u2019inscription de cette derni\u00e8re au Registre des Fondations du Minist\u00e8re espagnol de la Culture, le 27 avril 1990.\n\n48.\n\nThe Foundation had thus acquired the status of investor under the BIT.9\n\nSee Award at para. 543.\n\n**(2) Nationality**\n-------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal had no hesitation in concluding that \"... la Fondation Presidente Allende, \u00e9tant incorpor\u00e9e et ayant son si\u00e8ge en Espagne, remplit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence la condition de la nationalit\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019article 25 de la Convention CIRDI\".10\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 550.\n\n**(3) Consent**\n---------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that \"... il est clair que la Fondation Presidente Allende a consenti \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage (\u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de ce qui concernait la rotative Goss) le 6 octobre 1997.\"11\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 553.\n\n**C. The BIT**\n--------------\n\n**(1) Investment**\n------------------\n\n51.\n\nAfter referring to Article 1(2) of the BIT and calling in aid the Award of the Tribunal in the *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic,12* the Tribunal found that the Foundation \"satisfait la condition d\u2019investissement au sens de l\u2019API\".13\n\n*CME Czech Republic B. V. v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL Award, dated 14 March 2003.\n\nSee Award at para. 560.\n\n**(2) Nationality**\n-------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal referred to the definition of \"investor\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT and concluded that the Foundation had the Spanish nationality.\n\n**(3) Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Temporis*** **under the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal reasoned that the conclusion it had reached in respect of its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s disputes also applied to its jurisdiction over the Foundation. It said:\n\n567. Pour ces raisons, le Tribunal estime que les conclusions auxquelles il est arriv\u00e9 quant \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9tence *ratione temporis* pour conna\u00eetre des demandes de M. Pey Casado s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement aux demandes faites par la Fondation Presidente Allende et qu\u2019il est donc comp\u00e9tent *ratione temporis* pour conna\u00eetre des trois diff\u00e9rends invoqu\u00e9s par la Fondation Presidente Allende.\n\n**(4) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal thus dismissed Chile\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction over the *\"Fundaci\u00f3n Presidente Allende\"* in the following words:\n\n568. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la seconde partie demanderesse a \u00e9tabli, aux yeux du Tribunal arbitral, qu\u2019elle remplissait bien les conditions pos\u00e9es pour la comp\u00e9tence tant par l\u2019article 25 de la Convention CIRDI que par l\u2019API. Il en r\u00e9sulte d\u00e8s lors que le Tribunal arbitral est comp\u00e9tent pour statuer sur le fond du litige pour ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me partie demanderesse, la Fondation Presidente Allende.\n\n**D. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Violations of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Application of the BIT** ***Ratione Temporis***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants submitted to the Tribunal that: \"L\u2019application combin\u00e9e des paragraphes 2.2 et 2.3 permettrait de conclure que *de Trait\u00e9 [TAPI] peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des faits ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Trait\u00e9\u2019* car l\u2019API ne contient \u2018*aucune date butoir excluant de son champ d\u2019application des faits (actes de d\u00e9possession) \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019une controverse\u2019.* D\u00e8s lors qu\u2019une controverse est n\u00e9e entre les parties en 1995, post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9, les dispositions de fond de ce dernier sont applicables \u00e0 des faits ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e en vigueur.\"14\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 578.\n\n56.\n\nAfter a thorough review of the pertinent facts, various Chilean decrees and ministerial decisions as well as the parties arguments, the Tribunal concluded as follows:\n\n600. Apr\u00e8s examen des faits et des pr\u00e9tentions des parties, le Tribunal est parvenu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019expropriation r\u00e9sultant du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0165 ne peut \u00eatre analys\u00e9e comme un fait illicite continu et ne peut se voir appliquer les dispositions de fond de l\u2019API. En revanche, les dispositions de fond de l\u2019API sont applicables *ratione temporis* \u00e0 la violation r\u00e9sultant de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 et au d\u00e9ni de justice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les demanderesses, ces actes \u00e9tant post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9.\n\n**(2) Denial of Justice and Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and finding in respect of the breach by Chile of Article 4 of the BIT are well illustrated in the following paragraphs of the Award. The Committee will quote them *in extenso:*\n\n653. La question se pose en particulier de savoir si le comportement des autorit\u00e9s chiliennes, l\u00e9gislatives, administratives et judiciaires, peut ou non \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme constituant un \u00ab *d\u00e9ni de justice* \u00bb et une violation du devoir d\u2019accorder \u00e0 l\u2019investissement \u00e9tranger une protection suffisante, soit plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, un \u00ab traitement *juste et \u00e9quitable* \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 4 (1) de l\u2019API ainsi con\u00e7u :\n\n*\u00ab Chaque Partie garantira dans son territoire, en accord avec sa l\u00e9gislation nationale, un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable aux investissements r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par des investisseurs de l\u2019autre Partie, sous des conditions non moins favorables que pour ses investisseurs nationaux \u00bb.*\n\n[...]\n\n658. Dans le contexte sp\u00e9cifique du pr\u00e9sent litige, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente sentence dans sa partie Faits et dans les consid\u00e9rations juridiques qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, l\u2019application de la notion de \u00ab *d\u00e9ni de justice* \u00bb et celle de l\u2019obligation de \u00ab *traitement juste et \u00e9quitable* \u00bb n\u2019appellent pas de longue analyse. Elles se laissent r\u00e9sumer \u00e0 deux questions relativement simples :\n\n\u2022 La premi\u00e8re est celle de savoir si l\u2019absence de toute d\u00e9cision par les juridictions chiliennes pendant une p\u00e9riode de sept ann\u00e9es (1995-2002), d\u2019une part, et l\u2019absence de r\u00e9ponse de la Pr\u00e9sidence aux requ\u00eates de M. Pey Casado, d\u2019autre part, sont constitutives d\u2019un d\u00e9ni de justice.\n\n\u2022 La seconde est celle de savoir si les investissements reconnus par le Tribunal arbitral comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par M. Pey Casado ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9s du \u00ab *traitement juste et \u00e9quitable* \u00bb prescrit par l\u2019API.\n\n659. Sur la premi\u00e8re question, la r\u00e9ponse ne peut \u00eatre que positive, au regard des faits \u00e9tablis et d\u00e9j\u00e0 retenus par le Tribunal arbitral, l\u2019absence de toute d\u00e9cision par les tribunaux civils chiliens sur les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Pey Casado s\u2019analysant en un d\u00e9ni de justice.\n\n[... ]\n\n665. Sur la seconde question, celle de savoir si les investissements des demanderesses ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative s\u2019impose de l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, compte tenu des conclusions auxquelles il est parvenu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment aux termes de son appr\u00e9ciation des preuves et de son analyse juridique. En bref, il s\u2019agit de la conclusion selon laquelle M. Pey Casado a bien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des investissements et \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire de biens meubles ou immeubles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9s par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 militaire chilienne.\n\n[...]\n\n674. Dans le cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, en accordant des compensations - pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elle paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqu\u00e9s, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a manifestement commis un d\u00e9ni de justice et refus\u00e9 de traiter les demanderesses de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable.\n\n**E. The Tribunal\u2019s Assessment of Damages**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\n58. With respect to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the damages suffered by the Claimants, the Tribunal starts from the premise that, since in its Decision No. 43 Chile had already fixed the amount of damages which it owed to those persons whose property it had expropriated, \"Texistance m\u00eame de dommages r\u00e9sultant de la confiscation n\u2019appelle aucune analyse particuli\u00e8re\".15\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 680\n\n59.\n\n59. The Tribunal then recalled that the Claimants were seeking from the Respondent US$ 52,842,081 as *\"damnum emergens\"* and US$ 344,505,593 as *\"lucrum cessans\"* plus unquantified moral damages for Mr. Pey Casado.16\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 683.\n\n60.\n\n60. There then followed seven paragraphs which the Committee considers it should quote *in extenso* because, as will be seen later, of the conclusion which it has reached in respect of the breach by the Tribunal in its assessment of damages of two of the grounds set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n689. Dans l\u2019exercice de son droit et pouvoir d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des preuves, le Tribunal arbitral ne peut que constater que les demanderesses n\u2019ont pas apport\u00e9 de preuve, ou de preuve convaincante, ni par pi\u00e8ces, ni par t\u00e9moignage, ni par expertise, des importants dommages all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et caus\u00e9s par les faits relevant de la comp\u00e9tence *ratione temporis* du Tribunal arbitral, et cela qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse du *damnum emergens,* du *lucrum cessans,* ou encore d\u2019un dommage moral - la simple vraisemblance d\u2019un dommage dans les circonstances concr\u00e8tes de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne suffisant \u00e9videmment pas.\n\n[...]\n\n691. Il est clair aussi, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, que tout recours \u00e0 une expertise, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience arbitrale le montre, est en soi g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de nature \u00e0 augmenter, parfois fortement, la dur\u00e9e et les co\u00fbts d\u2019un arbitrage. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, le Tribunal arbitral est conscient de son devoir de mettre un terme, d\u00e8s que l\u2019\u00e9tat du dossier le permet, \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019une dur\u00e9e qui, d\u00e9passant la moyenne, a \u00e9t\u00e9 allong\u00e9e, ainsi qu\u2019on l\u2019a vu, pour des raisons diverses, dont la complexit\u00e9 inhabituelle des questions litigieuses et l\u2019attitude m\u00eame des parties.\n\n692. En l\u2019absence de preuves convaincantes apport\u00e9es par les demanderesses et le recours \u00e0 une ou plusieurs expertises devant \u00eatre exclu, le Tribunal arbitral est cependant en mesure de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation du dommage \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments objectifs d\u00e8s lors que, selon les donn\u00e9es incontest\u00e9es r\u00e9sultant du dossier, les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes elles-m\u00eames, \u00e0 la suite de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b0 43, ont fix\u00e9 le montant de la r\u00e9paration due aux personnes ayant, selon elles, droit \u00e0 une indemnisation.\n\n693. Il convient de rappeler dans ce contexte que le pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 indemniser n\u2019est pas celui souffert \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019expropriation (demande qui n\u2019est pas couverte par les dispositions de fond de l\u2019API), mais celui souffert en raison des violations de l\u2019API que le Tribunal arbitral a constat\u00e9es et \u00e0 propos desquelles il est comp\u00e9tent pour rendre une d\u00e9cision. Notamment, l\u2019indemnisation doit servir \u00e0 mettre les demanderesses dans la position dans laquelle elles seraient si les violations en question n\u2019avaient pas eu lieu, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire si, dans la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043, les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes avaient indemnis\u00e9 les demanderesses, et non pas des tierces personnes non-propri\u00e9taires des biens en question. Dans cette hypoth\u00e8se, les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes auraient accord\u00e9 le montant d\u2019indemnisation qu\u2019elles ont accord\u00e9 en vertu de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 aux demanderesses dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, celles-ci \u00e9tant, le Tribunal arbitral l\u2019a constat\u00e9, les v\u00e9ritables propri\u00e9taires des actions des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda. Par cons\u00e9quent, c\u2019est le montant pay\u00e9 comme indemnisation en vertu de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 qui correspond au pr\u00e9judice souffert par les demanderesses.\n\n694. L\u2019indemnisation d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 du 28 avril 2000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 allou\u00e9 [e] par le Minist\u00e8re des Biens Nationaux en vertu des d\u00e9crets d\u2019indemnisation n\u00b0 76-79, en date du 11 avril 2002. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un montant global d\u2019indemnisation de USD 10 millions, bien que le montant exact soit contest\u00e9 entre les parties.\n\n695. La demanderesse a communiqu\u00e9, par une lettre en date du 19 juillet 2007, au Tribunal les documents qui, selon elle[], lui permettent de conna\u00eetre les montants pr\u00e9cis allou\u00e9s aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 adopt\u00e9e par [le] Minist\u00e8re chilien des biens nationaux le 28 avril 2000 et des d\u00e9crets n\u00b076-79.\n\n61.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal fixed the damages owed by the Respondent to the Claimants atUS$ 10,132,690.18.17\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 702.\n\n62.\n\nIn its *dispositif* the Tribunal decided, as follows:\n\n1. d\u00e9cide qu\u2019il est comp\u00e9tent pour conna\u00eetre du litige entre les demanderesses et la R\u00e9publique du Chili ;\n\n2. constate que la d\u00e9fenderesse a viol\u00e9 son obligation de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les demanderesses d\u2019un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, en ce compris celle de s\u2019abstenir de tout d\u00e9ni de justice ;\n\n3. constate que les demanderesses ont droit \u00e0 compensation ;\n\n4. ordonne \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique du Chili de payer aux demanderesses le montant de USD 10,132,690.18, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 5%, compos\u00e9 annuellement, \u00e0 compter du 11 avril 2002 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date d\u2019envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence ;\n\n5. met \u00e0 la charge de la d\u00e9fenderesse une contribution aux frais et d\u00e9pens expos\u00e9s par les demanderesses, d\u2019un montant de USD 2,000,000,- (deux millions) ;\n\n6. d\u00e9cide que les frais de proc\u00e9dure seront support\u00e9s par les parties dans la proportion de: 3/4 du montant total (soit USD 3,136,893.34) pour la d\u00e9fenderesse et 1/4 du montant total (soit 1,045,631.11) pour les demanderesses ; ordonne en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de payer aux demanderesses la somme de USD 1,045,579.35 ;\n\n7. ordonne \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique du Chili de proc\u00e9der au paiement dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence, des sommes figurant dans le pr\u00e9sent dispositif (points 4, 5 et 6), faute de quoi le montant portera int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s annuellement au taux de 5%, \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence jusqu\u2019\u00e0 celle du parfait paiement ;\n\n8. rejette toutes autres ou plus amples conclusions.\n\n**IV. LEGAL STANDARD**\n----------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe three specific grounds upon which Chile requests the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention are the following:\n\n**Article 52**\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) [...]\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) [...]\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n64.\n\nThe Committee will now review these standards briefly as they have been interpreted by a series of *ad hoc* committees which can be said to be mostly *\"ad idem\".* The Committee will then review and analyze each one of the grounds for annulment invoked by Chile18 in respect of the eleven areas which it has identified.\n\nThe Committee notes that it is also seized of an application by the Claimants for annulment of paragraph 8 of the *dispositif* of the Award.\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe ground for annulment for manifest excess of powers is embodied in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. As explained by Commentators, this ground is meant to ensure, *inter alia,* that tribunals do not exceed their jurisdiction or fail to apply the law agreed upon by the parties.19 Independently of the methodology which will be followed, an annulment committee must inquire whether the tribunal exceeded the scope of its authority and whether this excess is manifest. As, the committee in *CDC v. Seychelles* stated:20\n\nA tribunal (1) must do something in excess of its powers and (2) that excess must be \"manifest.\" It is a dual requirement.\n\nSee Christoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge University Press, 2009) Art. 52 at paras. 132 - 133 (hereinafter *\"Schreuer Commentary Art. 52\").*\n\n*CDC Group PLC v. Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Annulment dated 29 June 2005 at para. 39 (hereinafter *\"CDC Decision\").*\n\n66.\n\nWith respect to the excess of powers, both parties agree that a tribunal can exceed its power in two ways: (i) by inappropriately exercising its jurisdiction (or failing to exercise jurisdiction); and (ii) by failing to apply the proper law.21 As regards the failure to apply the proper law, the parties agree that there is an important distinction between a failure to apply the proper law which is a ground for annulment, and an incorrect or erroneous application of that law, which is not a ground for annulment. The Committee agrees. As the *ad hoc* committee in *Amco I* explained:22\n\nThe law applied by the Tribunal will be examined by the *ad hoc* Committee, not for the purpose of scrutinizing whether the Tribunal committed errors in the interpretation of the requirements of applicable law or in the ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which such law has been applied. Such scrutiny is properly the task of a court of appeals, which the *ad hoc* Committee is not. The *ad hoc* Committee will limit itself to determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law, would constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. The *ad hoc* Committee has approached this task with caution, distinguishing failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment and misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at paras. 400-402; Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 216 and 389.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Ltd. and P.T. Amco Indonesia v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment dated 16 May 1986 at para. 23 (hereinafter *\"Amco I Decision\").*\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee notes that Chile also contends that under certain circumstances a misapplication of the law, even though the proper law was identified, can be so egregious as to constitute, in practice, the non-application of the proper law.23 In support of its submission, Chile refers to the decisions of several committees, including *Soufraki, Amco II, Vivendi II, MTD* and *Sempra,24*\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [38:2-16] (Eng.); [16:31-37] (Fr.); [40:22-41:5] (Spa.).\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 253-255; *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment dated 5 June 2007 (hereinafter *\"Soufraki Decision\"); Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Ltd. and P.T. Amco Indonesia v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Second Decision on Annulment dated 17 December 1992 (hereinafter *\"Amco II Decision\"); MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment dated 21 March 2007 (hereinafter *\"MTD Decision\"); Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on Annulment dated 29 June 2010; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Second Decision on Annulment dated 10 August 2010.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the proper application of a national law requires a tribunal to interpret that law as it is interpreted by the nation\u2019s courts, as well as its legal scholars, and authorities.25 In this respect, the Committee agrees with the nuance introduced by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Soufraki:26*\n\nIt is the view of the Committee that the Tribunal had to strive to apply the law as interpreted by the State\u2019s highest court, and in harmony with its interpretative (that is, its executive and administrative) authorities. This does not mean that, if an ICSID tribunal commits errors in the interpretation or application of the law, while in the process of striving to apply the relevant law in good faith, those errors would necessarily constitute a ground for annulment.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at paras. 415-418.\n\n*Soufraki Decision* at para. 97.\n\n69.\n\nThe parties disagree as to the meaning and scope of \"manifest\". According to Claimants, the tribunal\u2019s excess of its powers must be obvious simply on the face of the award, without any need for further analysis.27 For the Respondent, \"manifest\" can mean either \"obvious\" or \"substantial\" and establishing the existence of an excess of power may require a detailed analysis of complex factual and legal issues. This process does not *per se* mean that an excess is not manifest.28\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 224-225.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 412; Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 252.\n\n70.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Respondent that an extensive argumentation and analysis do not exclude the possibility of concluding that there is a manifest excess of power, as long as it is sufficiently clear and serious. In addition, the Committee is of the view that it has to follow a tenable standard of review of the tribunal\u2019s approach. It agrees with the committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner I:29*\n\nIt is possible to have different opinions on these delicate questions, or even, as do the Applicant for Annulment or the Dissenting Opinion, to consider the Tribunal\u2019s answers to them not very convincing, or inadequate. But since the answers seem tenable and not arbitrary, *they do not constitute the manifest excess of powers* which alone would justify annulment under Article 52(1)(b). In any case, the doubt or uncertainty that may have persisted in this regard throughout the long preceding analysis should be resolved *\"in favorem validitatis sententiae\"* and lead to rejection of the alleged complaint.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais SA.,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision on Annulment dated 3 May 1985 at para. 52(e) (hereinafter *\"Kl\u00f6ckner I Decision\").*\n\n**B. Serious Departure From a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe second ground for annulment of the Award invoked by Chile in its Annulment application is that there has been a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure as provided for in Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee notes that the parties agree on the meaning of this provision but disagree on the consequences of its application to the present case.\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Chile that this ground involves a three-part test: (i) the procedural rule must be fundamental; (ii) the Tribunal must have departed from it; and (iii) the departure must have been serious.30\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [pp. 22-23] (Eng.);[pp. 10-11] (Fr.); [pp. 25-26] (Spa.).\n\n73.\n\nFundamental rules of procedure are procedural rules that are essential to the integrity of the arbitral process and must be observed by all ICSID tribunals. The parties agree that such rules include the right to be heard, the fair and equitable treatment of the parties, proper allocation of the burden of proof and absence of bias.\n\n74.\n\nThe second part of the test requires that the Committee examine the full record, including the Transcripts and the Award to determine whether or not the Tribunal violated the rule in question.\n\n75.\n\nThe third part of the test relates to the seriousness of the departure. Here the Committee notes that there is significant disagreement between the parties as to how the seriousness of the violation can be ascertained.\n\n76.\n\nThe Committee observes that there are two series of precedents relating to this important requirement. They were well summarized by the Respondent at the Hearing on Annulment:31\n\n- Some committees have looked at the importance of the right involved. If the right is fundamental or substantial, its deprivation could jeopardize the legitimacy or integrity of the arbitral process. Therefore, in the view of those committees, the violation of such right deserves a remedy. As described by commentators and certain committees, \"the departure must be more than minimal\"32 or \"must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"33\n\n- Other committees have opined that the fundamental rule must relate to an outcome-determinative issue. In the *Wena* case, the committee held that \"the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\"34\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [35:1-19] (Eng.); [15:26-37] (Fr.); [38:1-18] (Spa.).\n\nSee *Schreuer Commentary Art. 52* at para. 287.\n\nSee *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on Annulment dated 2 December 1989 at para. 5.05 (hereinafter *\"MINE Decision\"); Amco II Decision* at paras. 9.09 - 9.10; *CDC Decision* at para. 49.\n\nSee *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment dated 5 February 2002 at para. 58 (hereinafter *\"Wena Decision\");* *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Decision on Annulment dated 8 January 2007 at para. 81; *CDC Decision* at para. 49.\n\n77.\n\nThe parties disagree on the nature of the impact of the departure on the award. Claimants argue that an applicant must prove that the denial of a fundamental rule of procedure did lead the Tribunal to a result different than it otherwise would have reached if the rule had been observed. The Respondent disagrees and argues that proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Tribunal would have changed its award imposes an insurmountable hurdle that ignores the inherent value of the rule itself.35 It concludes that the remit of the Committee is to enquire whether, if the rule had been observed, there is a distinct possibility (a \"chance\") that it may have made a difference on a critical issue.\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [30:11-31:7] (Eng.); [14:9-19] (Fr.); [33:11-34:4] (Spa.).\n\n78.\n\nThe Committee subscribes to the Respondent\u2019s view. The applicant is not required to show that the result would have been different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected. The Committee notes in fact that, in *Wena,* the committee stated that the applicant must demonstrate \"the impact that the issue may have had on the award.\"36 The Committee agrees that this is precisely how the seriousness of the departure must be analyzed.\n\nSee *Wena Decision* at para. 61\n\n79.\n\nThe parties also addressed the question of whether a committee has the discretion not to annul an award even where it finds that the tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.37 A review by the Committee of recent decisions of other *ad hoc* committees reveals that many of them have concluded that they had some discretion not to annul an award even where a ground for annulment is found, provided that such ground has no practical consequences.38 Some committees, however, have expressed the view that this reasoning does not apply to Article 52(1)(d) as the requirement of a \"serious\" departure already incorporates the substantiality of the impact. Therefore, if such ground is established, it requires annulment *ipso facto39*\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para 86; Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 41-42; Cl. Rej. Annulment at para. 33.\n\nSee *Wena Decision', CDC Decision', Soufraki Decision; Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment dated 3 July 2002 (hereinafter *\"Vivendi I Decision\"); Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on Annulment dated 1 November 2006 (hereinafter *\"Mitchell Decision\").*\n\nSee *CDC Decision; Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Decision on Annulment dated 25 March 2010 (hereinafter *\"Rumeli Decision\").*\n\n80.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it has no discretion not to annul an award if a serious departure from a fundamental rule is established. The Committee exercises its discretion when it determines whether or not the departure was serious. Examining the seriousness of the departure implies a review of seriousness of the act concerned, i.e., the deprivation of the legal right protected by the rule and a review of the seriousness of the consequence or impact of the departure. The discretion of the Committee lies in the evaluation of the impact. The impact will most likely be material and require an annulment if the departure affects the legal right of the parties with respect to an outcome-determinative issue. In other words, a finding that if the rule had been observed the tribunal could have reached a different conclusion. As indicated earlier, the Committee does not consider, however, that an applicant is required to prove that the tribunal would necessarily have changed its conclusion if the rule had been observed. This requires a committee to enter into the realm of speculation which it should not do. The Committee will therefore first seek to determine if there is a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and, if so, then examine the impact of the violation to decide whether or not it is serious.\n\n81.\n\nIt remains for the Committee to address the question of the possible waiver of claims which both parties have argued.40\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 38-40; Claimants\u2019 remarks at the Hearing on Annulment, Tr. Annulment [1] [199:16-200:20] (Eng.); [82:38-83:20] (Fr.); [216:14-217:21] (Spa.).\n\n82.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 27 and 53, a party may lose its right to object on the ground of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure if it has failed to raise its objection to the tribunal\u2019s procedure upon becoming aware of it, or \"promptly\" as mentioned in Rule 27. Clearly, this \"waiver\" can only be triggered if the applicant knew that the tribunal by its conduct had not complied with the rule and thus had a reasonable opportunity to raise its objection. If the objecting party acquired actual or constructive knowledge of a rule violation only after the award has become available, it cannot be considered as having waived its right to object.\n\n**C. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe first annulment committee in the *Vivendi* case discussed this ground in the following terms:\n\n[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons [...] Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.41\n\nSee *Vivendi I Decision* at paras. 64-65.\n\n84.\n\nCommittees in other annulment cases have expressed similar views.42\n\nSee *Amco I Decision* at paras. 38-44; *MINE Decision* at paras. 5.07-5.13; *Amco II Decision* at paras. 7.55-7.57; *Wena Decision* at paras. 77-82; *CDC Decision* at paras. 66-72; *Mitchell Decision* at para. 21.\n\n85.\n\nThe Committee subscribes to the interpretation of this standard enunciated by the first annulment committee in the *Vivendi* case. Furthermore, the parties appeared to accept this test. However, the parties disagree on how to address inconsistent or contradictory reasons. While the Respondent contends that incoherent, inconsistent or frivolous explanations on outcome-determinative points would constitute a failure to state reasons, the Claimants submit that only a failure to state reasons that is manifest can lead to the annulment of an award. In other words, only (i) a complete failure to provide any reason or (ii) manifestly frivolous or contradictory reasons could be an annullable error.43\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] for the Respondent: [pp. 45-46] (Eng.), [pp. 18-19] (Fr.), and [pp. 44-47] (Spa.); for the Claimants: [pp. 184-185] (Eng.), [p. 76] (Fr.), and [pp. 200-202] (Spa.).\n\n86.\n\nThe Committee believes that as long as there is no express rationale for the conclusions with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative point, an annulment must follow, whether the lack of rationale is due to a complete absence of reasons or the result of frivolous or contradictory explanations.\n\n**D. Scope of Annulment**\n-------------------------\n\n87.\n\nAs stated by several committees annulment is distinct from an appeal. The power for review is limited to the grounds of annulment set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.44 The committee in the *Soufraki* case pointed out that:45\n\n[T]he annulment review, although obviously important, is a limited exercise, and does not provide for an appeal of the initial award. In other words, it is not contested that \"... an *ad hoc* committee does not have the jurisdiction to review the merits of the original award in any way. The annulment system is designed to safeguard the integrity, not the outcome, of ICSID arbitration proceedings.\" (quoting Guide to ICSID Arbitration). This has been stressed very recently in the case MTD Equity and MTD Chile v. Republic of Chile:\n\n\"Under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an annulment proceeding is not an appeal, still less a retrial; it is a form of review on specified and limited grounds which take as their premise the record before the Tribunal.\"\n\nSee *Wena Decision* at para. 18 (citing to *Kl\u00f6ckner I* at paras. 3, 62, 119 and *MINE Decision* at para. 4.05).\n\nSee *Soufraki Decision* at para. 20.\n\n88.\n\nThe Committee endorses these statements without any reservation.\n\n**V. GROUND FOR ANNULMENT**\n---------------------------\n\n89.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention sets out the five grounds on the basis of which a party may request annulment of an award. This is an exhaustive list. The Article reads as follows:\n\n**Article 52**\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n90.\n\nAs noted earlier, in the present case Chile has invoked three of those specific grounds, manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and the failure of the Tribunal to state the reasons on which its award is based.\n\n91.\n\nIn the course of this annulment proceeding, the parties have made extensive written submissions. These submissions include:\n\n- Chile\u2019s Annulment Application (130 pages);\n\n- Chile\u2019s Memorial on Annulment dated 10 June 2010 (369 pages, English version);\n\n- Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Annulment dated 15 October 2010 (158 pages, French version);\n\n- Chile\u2019s Reply on Annulment dated 22 December 2010 (287 pages, English version);\n\n- Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Annulment dated 28 February 2011 (74 pages, French version).\n\n92.\n\nThe parties also filed \"pre-hearing skeletons\" on 27 May 2011. Finally, the parties made lengthy and detailed oral submissions during the hearing on 7 and 8 June 2011.\n\n93.\n\nAt this juncture of its Decision, the Committee will distil the massive record which it has considered carefully and identify the eleven specific areas which Chile has well summarized in its skeleton. For each one of these areas, the Committee will attempt to present, succinctly, the parties\u2019 respective arguments in respect of the three grounds for annulment, which it has invoked. The Committee will then deal with the Claimants\u2019 application for annulment of paragraph 8 of the Tribunal\u2019s *dispositif.*\n\n94.\n\nThe eleven areas are:\n\n1) Nationality  \n2) Investment  \n3) Denial of Justice  \n4) Discrimination  \n5) The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures  \n6) Damages  \n7) The May 2003 Hearing  \n8) The January 2007 Hearing  \n9) Document Requests  \n10) Bias by Arbitrator Bedjaoui  \n11) The Tribunal\u2019s *Ex Aequo et Bono* Decision.\n\n**A. Nationality**\n------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe parties agree that Mr. Pey Casado was at all times a Spanish national and also that he became a Chilean national by nationalization in 1958. The issue in dispute was whether Mr. Pey Casado thereafter ceased to be a Chilean national, prior to the two critical dates contemplated in Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, which are (1) the date of consent (2 October 1997), and (2) the date of registration (20 April 1998). Claimants argued that Mr. Pey Casado voluntarily renounced his Chilean citizenship prior to those two dates, and submitted three documents as evidence of that renunciation. Chile argued that none of those documents, on its face, could be considered a renunciation and that, in any event, any attempted renunciation would not have had any legal effect because voluntary renunciation of citizenship was not permitted at the time under the Chilean Constitution and did not become part of Chilean law until an explicit Constitutional amendment to that effect was approved in 2005. Chile also asserted that even if it were assumed, *arguendo,* that renunciation was legally possible in Chile at the time, the \"declaration\" that Mr. Pey Casado made to a Spanish consulate in Argentina manifesting his intent to renounce his Chilean citizenship could not have become effective until it was formally notified to Chilean authorities \u2014 which it submitted did not occur until well after the critical dates.\n\n**(1) Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe main issues raised by Chile regarding nationality in connection with Article 52(1)(b) are:\n\n- whether the Tribunal\u2019s application of Article 11 of the Chilean Constitution amounts to a manifest failure to apply the proper law;\n\n- whether the Tribunal improperly asserted jurisdiction by failing to assess and then determine whether Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s actions had in fact been sufficient to effect a renunciation of his Chilean nationality;\n\n- if so, whether such renunciation occurred prior to the two critical ICSID Convention dates; and\n\n- whether or not, in light of the foregoing, the Tribunal manifestly failed to apply Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n97.\n\nChile argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law46 by finding Article 11 of the Constitution ambiguous and the decisions of Chilean courts which it submitted inapposite. According to Chile, the Tribunal adopted an interpretation of the Chilean Constitution that was fundamentally at odds with the plain text of the relevant constitutional provision. Chile contends that it was not possible to renounce Chilean nationality voluntarily prior to 2005 when the Chilean Constitution was amended. Article 11 (\"Bases for Loss of Chilean Nationality\") of the Chilean Constitution provides as follows:47\n\nArticle 11. la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne se perd :\n\n1\u00b0. Par la naturalisation dans un pays \u00e9tranger, sauf dans le cas des Chiliens vis\u00e9s aux incises num\u00e9ros 1, 2 et 3 de l'article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui auraient obtenu une autre nationalit\u00e9 sans renoncer \u00e0 leur nationalit\u00e9 chilienne et conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du N\u00b0 4 de ce m\u00eame article.\n\nLa raison de la perte de la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne indiqu\u00e9e ci-dessus n'affectera pas les Chiliens qui, en vertu de dispositions constitutionnelles, l\u00e9gales ou administratives de l'Etat du territoire duquel ils r\u00e9sident, adoptent la nationalit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re comme condition de leur permanence dans ce pays ou comme condition d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 juridique des ressortissants du pays respectif dans l'exercice des droits civils ;\n\n2\u00b0. Par d\u00e9cret supr\u00eame, dans le cas de services rendus au cours d'une guerre aux ennemis du Chili ou \u00e0 leurs alli\u00e9s ;\n\n3\u00b0. Par un arr\u00eat condamnant les d\u00e9lits allant \u00e0 l'encontre de la dignit\u00e9 de la patrie ou des int\u00e9r\u00eats fondamentaux et permanents de l'Etat, et consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme tels par loi approuv\u00e9e au quorum qualifi\u00e9.

Par loi r\u00e9voquant la naturalisation conc\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 titre gracieux. Ceux qui auraient perdu la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne pour n'importe laquelle des raisons pr\u00e9vues au pr\u00e9sent article, ne pourront \u00eatre r\u00e9habilit\u00e9s que par la loi.\n\nSee Award at para. 307 *et seq.*\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 436. Footnotes omitted.\n\n98.\n\nChile avers that this list does not include \"unilateral voluntary renunciation\".48 Chile submits:49\n\n437. [...] Chile presented abundant jurisprudential and doctrinal evidence establishing that, under Chilean law, (a) the list of five grounds for losing Chilean nationality in Article 11 \u2014 which was the only Article of the Chilean Constitution that addressed this issue \u2014 was intended by the constitutional drafters to be an exhaustive one; (b) the list in Article 11 had subsequently been interpreted as exhaustive by courts and commentators; and (c) voluntary renunciation therefore did not exist at the time of the critical dates. As described below, Chile further noted at the 2007 jurisdictional hearing that this interpretation was roundly and unequivocally confirmed by the fact that a constitutional amendment was approved in Chile in 2005 that for the first time established voluntary renunciation as a basis for loss of Chilean nationality.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 437.\n\n*ibid.*\n\n99.\n\nChile argues that the Tribunal completely ignored its argument. It says:50\n\n451. Given the plain text of the relevant Constitutional article before and after the amendment, the situation was quite simple: before the amendment, there was no voluntary renunciation under Chilean law; after the amendment \u2014 which came into effect eight years after the initiation of the *Pey Casado* arbitration \u2014 voluntary renunciation became possible for the first time. Despite the Tribunal's explicit recognition that its task was to ascertain and apply Chilean law on this point, and despite the overwhelming evidence presented by Chile pointing to a widespread (and uniform) understanding of the relevant principles of Chilean law, it chose not to accept this uncontroverted legal truth. In doing so, it impermissibly ignored the fact that the settled law in Chile at the time of Mr. Pey's three alleged renunciations (which according to Mr. Pey took place in December 1996, January 1997, and September 1997, respectively) was that a Chilean national could not lose his Chilean nationality simply by attempting to voluntarily renounce it. This rule of law was plain, simple, unqualified, and uncontroversial, and no legitimate source of Chilean law had ever stated otherwise.\n\n452. In sum, even though the Tribunal (a) had expressly asserted in the Award that it deemed Chilean law to be exclusively the applicable law for purposes of its determination on Mr. Pey's nationality; (b) had accepted in its Award that Mr. Pey had not been deprived of his nationality by the Chilean State; and (c) had itself explicitly conceded in the Award that \"the Chilean Constitution does not expressly contemplate renunciation as a ground[] for loss of the Chilean nationality,\" the Tribunal nevertheless imposed its own, unsupported, interpretation of Chilean law on the subject. More specifically, it ruled: (a) that the list of bases for loss of nationality in Article 11 was not exhaustive (despite the conjunction \"and\" at the end of the list in Article 11, and the overwhelming jurisprudential and scholarly evidence showing that such list was indeed exhaustive and had consistently been interpreted as such); (b) that it was in fact possible under Chilean law to voluntarily renounce the Chilean nationality; (c) what is more, that it had always been possible to do so; (d) that the 2005 Constitutional Amendment had not created a new ground for loss of nationality; and (e) that the only new aspect of the 2005 constitutional amendment was that it had created a new requirement that formal renunciations had to be effected before a competent authority.\n\n453. In light of the foregoing, it is patently clear that the Tribunal failed to apply the unquestionably applicable principles of Chilean law, and by doing so, it failed to apply the law that it had itself characterized as the exclusive applicable law to the issue of nationality.\n\n454. In reaching these conclusions, and as further explained below, the Tribunal undertook two impermissible lines of analysis that justify annulment: First, it interpreted Chilean nationality law in terms of what it thought such law *ought to be* (to render it in the Tribunal's view more sensible or logical), rather than in terms of what that law *actually was,* according to both the plain text of the relevant norms of Chilean law, and of the Chilean jurisprudence and doctrinal literature. Second, the Tribunal tried to justify its conclusions \u2014 on an issue that, by its own admission, required a determination solely under Chilean law \u2014 by reference to a comparative international analysis that also demonstrates that the Tribunal did not apply the proper law, which was Chilean law, and Chilean law alone. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 451-454. Footnotes omitted.\n\n100.\n\nChile contends as follows in its Reply:51\n\n299. In sum, the Tribunal was obligated to determine not only whether Chilean law permitted Mr. Pey to renounce his nationality, but also: (a) whether any of the documents Mr. Pey presented were in fact sufficient for him to effectively renounce his Chilean nationality; and (b) whether any such renunciation had in fact been effected *before* the critical dates contemplated in Article 25 (2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Had the Tribunal properly applied Chilean law; drawn the conclusions that flowed logically\u2014and necessarily\u2014from the record; and applied Article 25(2)(a) to those facts, its jurisdictional determination would have been entirely different. This failure to apply the proper law (Chilean law of nationality and Article 25(2)(a) of the Convention) and the Tribunal's improper assertion of jurisdiction *ratione personae* constitute a manifest excess of power. which requires annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. [Emphasis added.]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 299.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal had discretion in interpreting Chilean law and that, in any event, it applied Chilean law correctly.52 They further assert that Chilean law did in fact contemplate voluntary renunciation of Chilean nationality, and that Mr. Pey Casado did in fact take the necessary steps to effect such a renunciation. In the words of the Claimants:53\n\n317. Selon la R\u00e9publique du Chili, le Tribunal aurait ignor\u00e9 le droit chilien, et en particulier la Constitution chilienne, en d\u00e9cidant que Monsieur Pey avait valablement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne.\n\n318. Cette affirmation est inexacte.\n\n319. Tout d'abord, comme le souligne la D\u00e9fenderesse, le Tribunal a express\u00e9ment indiqu\u00e9 que la question de la nationalit\u00e9 de Monsieur Pey \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par le droit chilien. Ainsi, le paragraphe 260 de la Sentence pr\u00e9cise :\n\n*Suivant ces r\u00e8gles bien \u00e9tablies en droit international, le Tribunal arbitral consid\u00e8re que*  *c 'est en appliquant le droit chilien que doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e la question de savoir* *si en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes ont, comme il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9, priv\u00e9 M. Pey Casado de sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, ou bien, s'il s 'av\u00e8re que tel n 'est pas le cas,*  *si M. Pey Casado a valablement renonc\u00e9*  *et*  *la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne* *,* (soulignement ajout\u00e9)\n\n320. C'est ce que le Tribunal arbitral a fait comme le d\u00e9montre la lecture des paragraphes 307 \u00e0 320 de la Sentence.\n\n321. Ainsi, le Tribunal arbitral a d'abord analys\u00e9 la Constitution chilienne de 1980 en vigueur \u00e0 la date de la renonciation volontaire de Monsieur Pey. Sur ce point, il indique \u00ab *le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 11 de la Constitution chilienne est ambigu sur la question et ne permet nullement d'affirmer ou de postuler un pr\u00e9tendu caract\u00e8re limitatif des cas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s de perte de nationalit\u00e9 \u00bb.*\n\n322. Cependant, comme l'a reconnu le Tribunal arbitral, la Constitution chilienne de 1980 pr\u00e9voyait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des cas de renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne. En effet, son article 11(1) disposait jusqu'\u00e0 sa modification le 25 ao\u00fbt 2005: *\u00ab la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne se perd par le fait d'avoir acquis la nationalit\u00e9 d'un pays \u00e9tranger, except\u00e9 dans le cas des chiliens entrfcfnt dans le cadre des paragraphes 1, 2 et 3 de l\u2019article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui auraient obtenu une autre nationalit\u00e9*  *sans avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur nationalit\u00e9 chilienne* *et ce en concordance avec ce qui est stipul\u00e9 au paragraphe 4 de ce m\u00eame article* \u00bb (soulignement ajout\u00e9).\n\n323. C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'a admis le Professeur Cea lors de son intervention \u00e0 l'audience de janvier 2007 par ces termes : *\u00ab si un chilien obtenait la nationalisation dans un pays \u00e9tranger, la Constitution* [de 1980] *lui permettait de conserver sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, si bien s\u00fbr un trait\u00e9 international de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 \u00e9tait en vigueur*  *et s'il d\u00e9cidait de ne pas renoncer*  *et*  *sa nationalit\u00e9*  chilienne \u00bb (soulignement ajout\u00e9).\n\n324. La possibilit\u00e9 de renoncer \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne avait d'ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par les Demanderesses dans leur M\u00e9moire compl\u00e9mentaire sur la comp\u00e9tence du 11 septembre 2002 citant plusieurs d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame chilienne ou arr\u00eats de Cours d'appel chiliennes.\n\n325. A cet \u00e9gard, il convient \u00e9galement de relever que l'argument de la R\u00e9publique du Chili selon lequel le Tribunal arbitral aurait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la Constitution chilienne en contradiction avec l'interpr\u00e9tation retenue par les juridictions chiliennes est d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de fondement.\n\n326. Cela r\u00e9sulte de la lecture des jurisprudences cit\u00e9es par les Demanderesses dans leurs diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9critures. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, le Tribunal arbitral a indiqu\u00e9 \u00ab *quant aux quelques d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux chiliens en la mati\u00e8re qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9s, aucune d'entre elles ne concerne* une *situation identique*  *et*  *celle* *du pr\u00e9sent litige, si bien qu 'il est difficile ou m\u00eame impossible d'y trouver la preuve du bien fond\u00e9 de l'une ou l'autre des th\u00e8ses contraires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es sur la renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 \u00bb.*\n\n327. Ayant constat\u00e9 l'existence de la renonciation volontaire dans le cas de l'acquisition de la nationalit\u00e9 d'un Etat \u00e9tranger, le Tribunal a alors indiqu\u00e9 :\n\n*\u00ab Rien n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, aucun texte l\u00e9gal ni aucune d\u00e9cision n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits ni aucun argument all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qui soit* susceptible *de justifier, de l'avis du Tribunal arbitral, un r\u00e9gime qui, en mati\u00e8re de renonciation volontaire, serait discriminatoire : permissif en cas d'acquisition d'une autre nationalit\u00e9, prohibitif en cas d\u2019autre nationalit\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquise, soit de double nationalit\u00e9 \u00bb.*\n\n328. Aux yeux du Tribunal, l'ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de droit chilien soumis par les Parties s'opposait \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de la R\u00e9publique du Chili, \u00e0 savoir que la Constitution chilienne interdisait la renonciation volontaire \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne.\n\n329. La conclusion \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal est parvenu est confort\u00e9e par le fait que certaines conventions internationales en vigueur au Chili pr\u00e9voient la possibilit\u00e9 de renoncer volontairement \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9. C'est ainsi le cas de la Convention] Am\u00e9ricaine des Droits de l'Homme dont l'art. 20.3 reconna\u00eet le droit \u00e0 changer de nationalit\u00e9 ; de la Convention panam\u00e9ricaine de Rio de Janeiro de 1906, comme l'a soulign\u00e9 le Tribunal dans sa Sentence. Ces conventions sont d'application imm\u00e9diate au Chili en vertu des articles 5 et 10.4 de la Constitution chilienne.\n\n330. Rappelons, s'agissant de la Convention Am\u00e9ricaine des Droits de l'Homme, qu'un Arr\u00eat du 2 avril 2001 de la Cour d'Appel de Valparaiso, confirm\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame le 13 juin suivant, a indiqu\u00e9 que, selon les termes de cette Convention, les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes ne pouvaient pas emp\u00eacher un chilien de changer de nationalit\u00e9 en lui interdisant de renoncer \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne. Or, la Convention] Am\u00e9ricaine des Droits de l'Homme a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e au syst\u00e8me juridique chilien en 1991, soit bien avant que Monsieur Pey ait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9.\n\n331. C'est \u00e9galement le cas de la Convention Bilat\u00e9rale sur la Double Nationalit\u00e9 sign\u00e9e entre l'Espagne et le Chili en 1958 (CDN), applicable \u00e0 Monsieur Pey, auquel renvoi l'article 10.4 de la Constitution de 1980 dans sa version en vigueur entre 1989 et 2005. En effet, l'article 6 de la CDN dispose : *\u00ab Les espagnols et les chiliens qui auraient acquis la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne ou espagnole en*  *renon\u00e7ant* *pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 leur nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019origine,* pourront *r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer cette derni\u00e8re, en d\u00e9clarant qu 'ils en ont la volont\u00e9 devant le Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Registre correspondant* \u00bb (soulignement ajout\u00e9).\n\n332. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la R\u00e9publique du Chili n'admet pas que le Tribunal arbitral soit parvenu \u00e0 cette conclusion en d\u00e9pit de l'intervention de Monsieur Cea, Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour Constitutionnelle chilienne, qui \u00e9tait venu affirmer, lors de l'audience du 15 janvier 2007, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de renoncer \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne avant la r\u00e9forme constitutionnelle de 2005.\n\n333. A cet \u00e9gard, il convient tout d'abord de rappeler que Monsieur Cea est intervenu en tant que repr\u00e9sentant de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation chilienne et non en qualit\u00e9 d'expert, en d\u00e9pit de ce que la R\u00e9publique du Chili tente de faire croire aux membres du Comit\u00e9 a*d hoc.*\n\n334. En second lieu, le Tribunal arbitral dispose d'un large pouvoir d'appr\u00e9ciation concernant la force probante des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui lui sont soumis et ce, m\u00eame s'agissant de la nationalit\u00e9, comme rappel\u00e9 dans l'affaire *Soufraki.*\n\n335. Enfin, les propos de Monsieur Cea ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement contredits par les Demanderesses lors de l'audience du 15 janvier 2007.\n\n336. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, c'est bien en application du droit chilien que le Tribunal arbitral a reconnu \u00e0 Monsieur Pey le droit de renoncer volontairement \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne. Tout au plus, le Tribunal a pu commettre une erreur de droit, *quod non,* ce qui ne serait de toute fa\u00e7on pas suffisant pour fonder l'annulation de la Sentence, quand bien m\u00eame cette erreur serait manifeste.\n\n337. Le recours form\u00e9 par la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur ce fondement n'est autre qu'un appel au fond et ne saurait, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00eatre admis par le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc.* La demande d'annulation du Chili sur ce fondement devra \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n\n338. L'argument de la R\u00e9publique du Chili consistant \u00e0 soutenir que le Tribunal arbitral aurait viol\u00e9 l'article 52(1)(b) en reconnaissant que Monsieur Pey avait effectivement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne est tout aussi mal fond\u00e9.\n\n339. Ainsi le Tribunal arbitral indique au paragraphe 322 de la Sentence :\n\n*Il revient donc au Tribunal arbitral d\u2019appr\u00e9cier le contenu et les effets du droit chilien sur la nationalit\u00e9 et de l'appliquer au cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ce faisant, le Tribunal est conduit*  *et*  *conclure de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la validit\u00e9* d'une *renonciation volontaire*  *et*  *la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne lorsque la partie renon\u00e7ant est double nationale,*  *renonciation dont la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e par la premi\u00e8re partie demanderesse* *(soulignement ajout\u00e9).*\n\n340. Cette conclusion du Tribunal arbitral est suffisante pour rejeter la pr\u00e9tention de la D\u00e9fenderesse. N\u00e9anmoins, dans un souci de clart\u00e9 pour le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc,* les Demanderesses proc\u00e9deront ci-dessous \u00e0 l'analyse de la Sentence concernant la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la renonciation \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne par Monsieur Pey.\n\n341. Pour les besoins de la d\u00e9monstration, il convient tout d'abord de rappeler les actes effectu\u00e9s par Monsieur Pey en renon\u00e7ant \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne tels que r\u00e9sum\u00e9s par le Tribunal arbitral dans sa Sentence aux paragraphes 288 \u00e0 292.\n\n[...]\n\n357. S'agissant de la date de la d\u00e9claration, le Tribunal arbitral fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la date du 16 septembre 1997 lorsque Monsieur Pey a express\u00e9ment indiqu\u00e9 au Consulat d'Espagne que sa lettre du 10 d\u00e9cembre 1996 au D\u00e9partement Etranger et Immigration du Minist\u00e8re de l'Int\u00e9rieur chilien devait \u00eatre entendue comme une d\u00e9claration solennelle de sa renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne.\n\n358. Ainsi, la d\u00e9claration de renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 est intervenue le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1996, r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e au plus tard le 16 septembre 1997, en tout \u00e9tat de cause avant les dates pertinentes de l'article 25 de la Convention de Washington.\n\n359. L'all\u00e9gation de la R\u00e9publique du Chili selon laquelle la d\u00e9claration ne serait intervenue que le 10 juillet 1998, date \u00e0 laquelle l'Ambassade d'Espagne \u00e0 Santiago du Chili a inform\u00e9 le Minist\u00e8re des Relations Ext\u00e9rieures chilien de la renonciation \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne par Monsieur Pey est donc erron\u00e9e. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, avec cet argument, la R\u00e9publique du Chili tente de former un appel au fond de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, celui-ci ayant clairement indiqu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9claration de renonciation \u00e9tait intervenue avant cette date en application de la loi.\n\n360. Il r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9veloppements ci-dessus que le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* devra rejeter la demande d'annulation de la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur ce fondement. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 280-281.\n\nThis is a long citation but the Committee considers that it should be reproduced in full. See Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 317-341; 357-360. Footnotes omitted.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Committee, after a thorough review of this part of the Award - wherein it concludes that Mr. Pey Casado had validly renounced his Chilean nationality prior to the two critical dates - and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, finds that the Tribunal did apply and interpret the proper Chilean law of nationality. The Tribunal referred not only to the Chilean Constitution but also to international conventions such as the Spain -Chile Dual Nationality Convention, the Rio de Janeiro Pan-American Convention of 1906, as well as the Inter-American Convention of Human rights in order to reach its conclusion. The Committee agrees with the Claimants that its remit is not to examine whether or not the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation complies with Chilean law but whether the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation is manifestly contrary to the principles of Chilean law. In the light, *inter alia,* of the introductory paragraph of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis on the question of nationality, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal reached its conclusion on the basis of its interpretation of the proper Chilean law:54\n\nDe l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019est pas parvenue \u00e0 apporter une d\u00e9monstration convaincante de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, en droit chilien, d\u2019une renonciation volontaire \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, en l\u2019absence de textes pr\u00e9cis et de jurisprudence pertinente. Ainsi, quant aux quelques d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux chiliens en la mati\u00e8re qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9es, aucune d\u2019entre elles ne concerne une situation identique \u00e0 celle du pr\u00e9sent litige, si bien qu\u2019il est difficile ou m\u00eame impossible d\u2019y trouver la preuve du bien fond\u00e9 de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des th\u00e8ses contraires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es sur la renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9.\n\nSee Award at para. 307.\n\n103.\n\nChile may not agree with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and may have wished that the Tribunal had adopted its thesis but it cannot say that the Tribunal\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction *ratione personae* rises to the level of a manifest excess of power. Chile\u2019s challenge is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**(2) Failure to State Reasons**\n--------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nChile argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its finding in respect of nationality and thus breached Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Specifically, says Chile, the Tribunal failed to state reasons:\n\n- for its determination that Mr. Pey Casado was no longer a Chilean national at the time of the critical dates for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;\n\n- for its conclusion that voluntary renunciation of nationality was permissible under Chilean law (in particular under Article 11 of the Chilean Constitution);\n\n- for its conclusion that Mr. Pey Casado - as a matter of fact - renounced his Chilean nationality;\n\n- for its conclusion that any such renunciation occurred prior the critical dates under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention;\n\n- for placing the burden on Chile - after Chile had proven that Mr. Pey Casado had become a Chilean national in 1958 - of further proving that thereafter Mr. Pey Casado had not renounced his Chilean nationality *(probatio diab\u00f3lica),* rather than placing the burden on the Claimants to prove that he had renounced it; and\n\n- for its conclusions that the Chile-Spain BIT\u2019s nationality-based jurisdictional requirements did not bar the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n105.\n\nChile submits as follows:55\n\n454. [...] In particular, it is impossible to discern how it reached the conclusion that voluntary unilateral renunciation was permissible under Chilean law in 1996-7 (which is the time period during which Mr. Pey allegedly renounced his Chilean nationality). Such conclusion is particularly implausible given: (a) the directly contrary textual content of the relevant Constitutional provision; (b) the universally consistent Chilean jurisprudence and doctrine on this point; (c) the fact that it was not until the Constitution was amended in 2005 that voluntary renunciation became\u2014for the first time\u2014a basis for loss of nationality under Chilean constitutional law.\n\n[...]\n\n462. In attempting to address this issue in their Counter-Memorial, Claimants quote paragraphs 317 *et seq.* of the Award. However, those paragraphs merely discuss the issue of the power of appreciation of the Tribunal; they do not address the central point raised by Chile, which is the absence of any reasons for the Tribunal's conclusion that effective renunciation can occur without any notice to the State concerned and/or for the Tribunal's conclusion that Mr. Pey had in fact renounced his Chilean nationality prior to the critical dates under Article 25(2)(a). [Emphasis added]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 454; 462. Footnote omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Tribunal, in its Award, did provide ample reasons. They write:56\n\n361. La R\u00e9publique du Chili soutient \u00e9galement que la Sentence doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e pour d\u00e9faut de motivation en application de l'article 52(1)(e). Selon elle, le Tribunal n'aurait pas motiv\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision reconnaissant la possibilit\u00e9 de renoncer \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne en droit chilien. Il n'aurait pas non plus expliqu\u00e9 quels actes de Monsieur Pey \u00e9taient constitutifs d'une renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne. A cet \u00e9gard, la R\u00e9publique du Chili pr\u00e9tend que la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle Monsieur Pey avait r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 par sa d\u00e9claration devant le Consulat d'Espagne \u00e0 Mendoza (Argentine), serait en contradiction avec sa conclusion pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente selon laquelle la lettre de 1996 ne constituerait pas une renonciation \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9.\n\n362. En premier lieu, les d\u00e9veloppements ci-dessus d\u00e9montrent que le Tribunal n'a pas renvers\u00e9 la charge de la preuve, a effectivement appliqu\u00e9 le droit chilien pour trancher la question de la nationalit\u00e9 de Monsieur Pey aux dates pertinentes de l'article 25 de la Convention CIRDI et que la Sentence est suffisamment motiv\u00e9e.\n\n363. On rappellera que le contr\u00f4le du Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* doit se limiter \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier que le Tribunal a motiv\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sans qu'il ait besoin de se prononcer sur le bien fond\u00e9 de son raisonnement ou sur son caract\u00e8re convaincant, sauf \u00e0 admettre un appel au fond. [Emphasis added]\n\n364. S'agissant du point de savoir si les actes de Monsieur Pey \u00e9taient constitutifs d'une renonciation \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, le Tribunal arbitral a expos\u00e9 sa position aux paragraphes 317 et suivants de la Sentence. Il indique *\u00able 16 septembre 1997, Monsieur Pey Casado a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 express\u00e9ment aupr\u00e8s du Consulat d\u2019Espagne \u00e0 Mendoza (Argentine) \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de renonciation au cas o\u00f9 serait requise par l\u2019Administration chilienne une renonciation formelle \u00bb.*\n\n365. Cette affirmation doit se lire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la Sentence, et en particulier des paragraphes 288 et suivants, ce que fait d'ailleurs la R\u00e9publique du Chili.\n\n366. Ceci \u00e9tant, contrairement \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de la D\u00e9fenderesse, le Tribunal ne se contredit pas. En effet, lorsque le Tribunal indique que *\u00ab la d\u00e9claration de Monsieur Pey Casado de son* changement *de r\u00e9sidence vers l'Espagne a pour cons\u00e9quence un changement de la loi qui lui est applicable mais ne le prive nullement de ses deux nationalit\u00e9s* \u00bb (Sentence \u00a7294), c'est en tenant compte des termes de la lettre du 10 d\u00e9cembre 1996 qui sont ambigus.\n\n367. Dans cette lettre, Monsieur Pey indiquait :\n\n*J\u2019accomplis* [la formalit\u00e9 consistant \u00e0] *vous informer que depuis 1974 ma r\u00e9sidence habituelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e en Espagne o\u00f9 elle se situe* actuellement *Ronda Granero n\u00b013, 28043 Madrid. Par cons\u00e9quent, ma nationalit\u00e9 \u00e9tant l'espagnole, durant mon s\u00e9jour au Chili, je n'ai pas recours aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la Convention bilat\u00e9rale du 24 mai 1958.*\n\n368. Cependant, le Tribunal poursuit en pr\u00e9cisant \u00ab *la seule question est donc de savoir si*  *la d\u00e9claration et les autres actes de Monsieur Pey Casado* *\u00e9quivalent*  *et*  *une renonciation*  *et*  *la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne* \u00bb (Sentence \u00a7295).\n\n369. Or, l'un des autres actes \u00e9mis par Monsieur Pey et retenu par le Tribunal arbitral est la d\u00e9claration de Monsieur Pey du 16 septembre 1997 dans laquelle il pr\u00e9cise \u00ab *pour ne laisser place*  *et*  *aucun doute*  *et*  *cet \u00e9gard, je d\u00e9clare que la communication*  *du 10 d\u00e9cembre 1996* *(...) doit s\u2019entendre de la fa\u00e7on qui convienne le mieux en Droit*  *aux fins desquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e,* y *compris comme preuve de ma renonciation expresse et solennelle*  *et*  *la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne au cas o\u00f9 serait requise par l'Administration chilienne une renonciation formelle*  *et*  *la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne,* *ce que j'affirme et*  *et*  *quoi je souscris de nouveau par la pr\u00e9sente* \u00bb (soulignement ajout\u00e9).\n\n370. D\u00e8s lors, si la lecture de la seule lettre du 10 d\u00e9cembre 1996 pouvait laisser subsister une ambig\u00fcit\u00e9 sur les intentions de Monsieur Pey, cette m\u00eame lettre, lue \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9claration faite par Monsieur Pey en 1997, ne laisse plus de place au doute. Or, dans la d\u00e9claration de 1997, c'est bien la lettre de 1996 qui constitue une renonciation.\n\n371. D\u00e8s lors, comme pour les autres fondements relatifs \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 de Monsieur Pey, la demande d'annulation de la Sentence sur ce fondement sera rejet\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc.* [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 364 - 371. Footnotes omitted.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Committee has no hesitation in endorsing the submission of the Claimants. Even if the Committee were to disagree with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Chilean Constitution and its analysis of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s effective renunciation of his Chilean nationality (which we do not), by no stretch of the imagination can the Committee conclude that the Tribunal failed to state reasons to support its conclusions. In fact, the Tribunal provided ample reasons which (although this is not a question which the Committee is called upon or empowered to decide) the Committee finds quite compelling.\n\n108.\n\nWith respect to the interpretation of the 1980 Chilean Constitution, it is the Committee\u2019s view that the Tribunal articulated sufficient and, indeed, convincing reasons for concluding that voluntary unilateral renunciation is permissible under the Constitution. The Tribunal first determined that there is no case law forbidding voluntary unilateral renunciation. The Tribunal then found that none of the court decisions submitted and relied upon by the parties involves a situation similar to the present case.57 It is not the role of the Committee to review these decisions.\n\nSee Award at para. 307.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal then focused on the text of Article 11 of the Chilean Constitution. It first determined that the text is ambiguous as to whether it contains an exhaustive or non-exhaustive list of the bases for loss of Chilean nationality. It then explained why, in its view, the Article could not be interpreted as containing an exhaustive list of such bases.58\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 308-310.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal explained why, in its opinion, it would be illogical to conclude that the text of the Constitution allows renunciation in the case of acquisition of a new nationality but does not allow such renunciation in the case of a nationality already acquired (e.g, dual nationality), or condition such renunciation on the acquisition of a third nationality.59\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 311.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that voluntary unilateral renunciation existed before the 2005 amendment to the Constitution.60 The Committee notes in this regard the reference by the Claimants to the testimony of Dr. Cea, President of the Chilean Constitutional Court, who, during the January 2007 Hearing, acknowledged that it is possible to renounce voluntarily one\u2019s Chilean nationality under the 1980 Constitution, thus corroborating the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion:61\n\nsi un chilien obtenait la nationalisation dans un pays \u00e9tranger, la Constitution [de 1980] lui permettait de conserver sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, si bien s\u00fbr un trait\u00e9 international de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 \u00e9tait en vigueur et s\u2019il d\u00e9cidait de ne pas renoncer \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 312.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 323 (referring to Tr. Jur. [1] [20:24-28] (Fr.) submitted as CN-213).\n\n112.\n\nFinally, the Committee notes that the Tribunal referred at length in its Award to international conventions and principles of international law regarding nationality to support its conclusion.62\n\nSee Award at paras. 313-315; 319-322.\n\n113.\n\nChile argues that even if one were to accept that voluntary renunciation was legally possible before 2005, Mr. Pey Casado did not effect a valid renunciation before the two critical dates of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal according to Chile, failed to state reasons for rejecting this argument and for its conclusion that Mr. Pey Casado did in fact renounce his Chilean nationality before the critical dates.\n\n114.\n\nThe Committee disagrees and refers to paragraphs 288 to 292 of the Award where the Tribunal summarized what it ultimately found to be the Claimants\u2019 convincing arguments on this question. As described in the Award, the Claimants argued that Mr. Pey Casado renounced his Chilean nationality in three documents dated 10 December 1996, 7 January 1997, and 16 September 1997, respectively. The Claimants also submitted that Chile was notified of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s renunciation on 10 July 1998 and that the renunciation was formally registered by a Chilean official on 4 August 1998.63 Chile replied that the 10 December 1996 and 7 January 1997 documents could not be construed as expressing a wish to renounce one\u2019s nationality64 and that the 16 September 1997 document was not presented to any Chilean official and was only received by Chile on 10 July 1998, *i.e.*after the two critical dates. In response, the Claimants argued that the effective date of renunciation is in any case the date when such renunciation is declared, which was clearly prior to the critical dates, rather than the date on which it is registered.65\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 660.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 661.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 350.\n\n115.\n\nIn its analysis of the parties\u2019 respective positions on this issue, the Tribunal found that Mr. Pey Casado expressly renounced his Chilean nationality in the third document, namely, the document of 16 September 1997. The renunciation was thus effected as of that date. The Tribunal further found that this renunciation was formally registered by a Chilean official on 4 August 1998.66\n\nSee Award at para. 317.\n\n116.\n\nWhile the Award does not address the point raised by the Respondent regarding the date of presentation of the 16 September 1997 document to the Chilean authorities, it is clear, and the Committee so finds, that this is because the Tribunal evidently considered that this point was not critical to its determination of whether or not Mr. Pey Casado validly renounced his Chilean nationality, which the Tribunal found occurred with the document of 16 September 1997. The Committee notes in this regard that the Tribunal relied in particular on the *Soufraki* award, in which it was held that while a tribunal \"[...] will accord great weight to the nationality law of the State in question and to the interpretation and application of that law by its authorities [...] it will in the end decide for itself whether [...] the person whose nationality is at issue was not a national of the State in question [...]\".67 Thus once the Tribunal concluded that the renunciation validly occurred with the 16 September 1997 document, prior to the critical dates, the entire question of notification to the Chilean authorities, including whether such notification was or was not made prior to the critical dates, became superfluous.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 318-319 (quoting *Soufraki Decision* at para. 55).\n\n117.\n\nIn sum, on the issue of nationality, the Committee finds the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning to be comprehensive. This ground is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**(3) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile regarding nationality in connection with Article 52(1)(d) is whether the Tribunal\u2019s imposition of the burden of proof upon Chile on this issue was proper. As noted earlier, the parties agreed that Mr. Pey Casado has been at all times a Spanish national and also that he became a Chilean national by nationalization in 1958. As we saw above, the parties disputed whether Mr. Pey Casado had ceased to be a Chilean national before the two \"critical dates\". Chile emphasizes that this issue was central to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, because if the Tribunal had found that Mr. Pey Casado had still been a dual Chilean-Spanish national on at least one of the critical dates, it would have lacked jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention to hear Claimants\u2019 claim.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n119.\n\nChile contends that \"[s]ince it was accepted even by the Claimants that Mr. Pey Casado had been a Chilean national, the burden of proof should have been on Mr. Pey Casado to prove that he had in fact renounced his Chilean nationality at some point prior to the critical dates for purposes of Article 25(2)(a), as he claimed\".68 Chile submits:69\n\n350. Despite the fact that proof of Mr. Pey's valid renunciation of his Chilean citizenship was a necessary element for him to establish that he satisfied ICSID's jurisdictional requirements relating to nationality, and the fact that \"[t]he investor must evidence all the necessary conditions for the Arbitral Tribunal to affirm its jurisdiction,\" the Tribunal instead placed the burden of proof upon the Republic. And it did so by imposing on Chile a *probatio diab\u00f3lica,* requiring that it prove that Mr. Pey had *not* renounced his Chilean nationality. Given that Mr. Pey was the proponent of the assertion that he *had* renounced, the burden should have been on him to prove that he had in fact validly done so. However in the Award, the Tribunal found that the Republic \"n'est pas parvenue \u00e0 apporter une d\u00e9monstration convaincante de l'impossibilit\u00e9 ou l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, en droit chilien, d'une renonciation volontaire \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, en l'absence de textes pr\u00e9cis et de jurisprudence pertinente.\" Because it used this statement to explain its jurisdictional decision in favor of the Claimants, it is evident that the Tribunal placed the burden of proof upon the Respondent on this issue.\n\n[...]\n\n354. Here, if the Tribunal had not improperly placed the burden of proof upon the Respondent on the issue of Mr. Pey's Chilean nationality, it is clear that a \"substantially different\" award might have been reached, as Mr. Pey would not have survived the Republic's nationality-based jurisdictional challenge. The fact that the Tribunal's reversal of the burden of proof on nationality was outcome-determinative is nowhere more evident than in the May 2002 jurisdictional ruling: had the Tribunal there imposed on Mr. Pey the burden of proving that he had renounced Chilean nationality, instead of placing it on the Republic to prove that Mr. Pey had *not* validly renounced such nationality, the Tribunal would have had to uphold Chile's jurisdictional challenge and dismiss Mr. Pey's claim. This conclusion is compelled by the fact that the Tribunal explicitly indicated that neither party had managed to prove its respective assertions, which a *fortiori* means that if the burden of proof had been inverted, Chile rather than the Claimants would have prevailed on the jurisdiction challenge. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 348.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 350; 354. Footnotes omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, after they had adduced evidence that Mr. Pey Casado had renounced his Chilean nationality prior to the \"critical dates\", the Tribunal rightly concluded that the burden of proof shifted to Chile which had to demonstrate that the renunciation was not valid. They write:70\n\n296. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les Demanderesses ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Monsieur Pey avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la date pertinente pour l\u2019article 25 de la Convention CIRDI. Tant les autorit\u00e9s espagnoles que les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes avaient reconnu et accept\u00e9 cette renonciation. Ce faisant, les Demanderesses ont satisfait aux exigences de l\u2019article 25 de la Convention CIRDI en d\u00e9montrant que Monsieur Pey avait la nationalit\u00e9 exclusive espagnole aux dates pertinentes.\n\n297. Il appartenait donc \u00e0 la D\u00e9fenderesse de d\u00e9montrer que la renonciation de Monsieur Pey \u00e0 sa nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, reconnue par l\u2019Espagne et le Chili, \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 la Constitution chilienne pour que son exception d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence prosp\u00e8re.\n\n298. En outre, quelle que soit la partie sur laquelle repose le fardeau de la preuve, le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 sur les r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 la preuve pour fonder sa d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la th\u00e8se soutenue par les Demanderesses \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019exception soulev\u00e9e par la R\u00e9publique du Chili.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras 296-298. Footnote omitted.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants. The Tribunal\u2019s approach was proper. Looking to Chile to prove that the Claimants\u2019 renunciation was invalid after it had concluded that the Claimants had discharged their burden of proving that Mr. Pey Casado had renounced his Chilean nationality is not a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, let alone a serious one. Chile\u2019s request is therefore dismissed.\n\n**B. Investment**\n-----------------\n\n**(1) Ownership of the Investment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nChile submits that the question as to whether Mr. Pey Casado was the owner of the investment, the CPP Shares in *El Clar\u00edn,* is extremely important since a conclusion by the Tribunal that he was not the owner would have obviously led the Tribunal to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute. The Tribunal decided that Mr. Pey Casado was the owner of the shares based on three sets of documents: (1) two documents that Mr. Pey Casado claimed to be contracts for his purchase of the CPP shares (the so-called \"Estoril Protocol\" and \"Geneva Declaration\"); (2) certain wire transfers that Mr. Pey Casado claimed to have been payments for the shares; and (3) certain CPP share certificates and blank transfer certificates that Mr. Pey Casado had in his possession.\n\n(i) *Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe main issues raised by Chile regarding ownership of the investment are:\n\n- whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to identify -and therefore, to apply - the proper law to assess the validity of the Estoril and Geneva documents as purchase agreements. To determine whether these documents were valid purchase contracts entered into in Spain, the Tribunal was required to apply the Spanish Civil Code, which is the code that regulates contracts in general, and purchase contracts in particular;\n\n- whether, assuming *arguendo* that the Tribunal identified the proper law, it failed to apply such law by interpreting the Estoril and Geneva documents as purchase contracts; and\n\n- whether the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law by rejecting the application of the Chilean legal norms that governed the transfer of company shares in Chile at the time of the alleged investment *(viz.,* Article 451 of the Chilean Commercial Code and Article 37 of Corporation Regulations), and deciding instead that the transfer of the CPP shares to Mr. Pey Casado was valid, without identifying the relevant rule on which the Tribunal relied to support such conclusion.\n\n(ii) *Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile regarding ownership of the investment in connection with Article 52(1)(e) is whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusions on the issues relating to the validity of the transfer of the CPP shares and on Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s resulting ownership of the shares.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n125.\n\nChile summarizes its position as follows:71\n\n391. As demonstrated above, contrary to Claimants' contention in their Counter-Memorial, Chile is not arguing merely that the Tribunal misinterpreted or erred in applying the proper law to determine whether Mr. Pey acquired the CPP shares. Rather, it is Chile's position that the Tribunal completely failed to apply the proper law by applying the *wrong set of rules* to reach the various determinations that led to its conclusion concerning Mr. Pey's ownership of the shares. Indeed, the Tribunal failed to apply: (a) the appropriate provisions of the Spanish Civil Code to the issue of the validity of the alleged purchase agreements or contracts (the Estoril Protocol and Geneva Declaration); and (b) the Chilean Commercial Code and Chile's Regulation of National and Foreign Companies to the issue of the validity of the transfer of the CPP shares.\n\n392. By basing key determinations concerning the issue of ownership of the CPP shares on an application of the wrong law, and/or on a non-application of the correct law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, which warrants annulment of the Award under Article 52 (1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 391-392. Footnote omitted.\n\n126.\n\nChile further contends that there are several facets of the Tribunal\u2019s determination concerning the existence of an \"investment\" covered by the BIT that the Tribunal failed to explain.72\n\nSee list of sixteen examples at para. 683 and three additional examples at para. 475 of Resp. Mem. Annulment.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimants reject Chile\u2019s contention, they submit:73\n\n239. N'ayant trouv\u00e9 ni dans les textes, ni dans l'application qu'en avaient fait les cours chiliennes, la confirmation de la th\u00e8se de la D\u00e9fenderesse, le Tribunal a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce silence comme la d\u00e9monstration que la sanction ne pouvait pas \u00eatre la nullit\u00e9 absolue, celle-ci ne se pr\u00e9sumant, en principe, pas. Par cette conclusion, le Tribunal n'a pas refus\u00e9, ou omis, d'appliquer le droit chilien pertinent en la mati\u00e8re. Tout au plus, la R\u00e9publique du Chili pourrait pr\u00e9tendre que le Tribunal a commis une erreur dans son appr\u00e9ciation, erreur qui n'est pas suffisante pour justifier l'annulation de la Sentence, quand bien m\u00eame elle serait *\u00ab manifestement injustifi\u00e9e \u00bb.*\n\n240. Le Tribunal arbitral poursuit en indiquant que, selon les dispositions de droit chilien, l'accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s n'est enferm\u00e9 dans aucun d\u00e9lai. D\u00e8s lors, Monsieur Pey aurait pu y rem\u00e9dier s'il n'en avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 par la confiscation de ses titres et du Livre-registre des actionnaires par les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes.\n\n241. Il en r\u00e9sulte que le Tribunal arbitral n'a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 une norme de droit applicable, il l'a au contraire mise en \u0153uvre dans toute sa port\u00e9e. Les discussions de la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur cette partie de la Sentence ont pour objet de faire infirmer la conclusion du Tribunal arbitral par la voie d'un appel au fond, ce qui est exclu par l'article 53 de la Convention CIRDI.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 239-242. Footnotes omitted.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants also reject Chile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in this regard.74\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 447.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n129.\n\nIt is clear that Chile is here seeking in effect to appeal the Tribunal\u2019s decision and is asking the Committee to substitute its decision for that of the Tribunal. As is well established, this is not the remit of an Annulment Committee. An *ad hoc* committee is not an appeal body. In any case, the Committee finds that the Tribunal has not exceeded its powers and that it has provided ample reasons for its conclusion that Mr. Pey Casado was the owner of all the CPP shares.\n\n130.\n\nChile argues that the Tribunal completely failed to apply the proper law by applying the wrong set of rules to reach its determination that Mr. Pey Casado was the owner of the shares. Chile impugns two facets of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, concerning: (i) the validity of the share purchase agreements; and (ii) the validity of the transfer of the CPP shares. With respect to the share purchase agreements (the Estoril Protocol and Geneva Declaration), Chile argues that the Tribunal should have applied the Spanish Civil Code rather than the Spanish Commercial Code. With regard to the transfer of the shares, Chile contends that the Tribunal should have applied the Chilean Commercial Code and the Regulation of National and Foreign Companies rather than the Chilean Civil Code.75\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 391.\n\n131.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal based its analysis regarding the ownership of the CPP shares on a series of detailed findings of facts.76 The legal issue of the validity of the contracts is introduced by the Tribunal in the following words:77\n\nDans le souci d\u2019\u00eatre complet, le Tribunal examinera en dernier lieu l\u2019argument de la d\u00e9fenderesse visant \u00e0 contester la validit\u00e9 juridique du contrat de vente des actions de CPP S.A.\n\nSee Award at paras. 202-218.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 219.\n\n132.\n\nThe question of \"*la validit\u00e9 juridique du contrat de vente des actions\"* was not essential to the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusion concerning ownership of the CPP shares. Therefore, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Tribunal applied the wrong law to determine that question (which, to be clear, the Committee does not say was the case), such an error would not amount to a manifest excess of power or a failure to state reasons. In any event, the Committee is persuaded by the Claimants\u2019 arguments that the Tribunal implicitly applied the Spanish Civil Code (Article 1445 in particular) by referring to the Claimants\u2019 analysis made during the May 2003 Hearing and by stating that there was an agreement on the object and the price.78 Finally, the Committee notes that, as asserted by the Claimants, Chile never argued before the Tribunal that the Spanish Civil Code was applicable to determine the validity of the purchase agreements. Instead, Chile was focusing on the language used in the documents concerned. It goes without saying that the Award cannot be annulled on the basis of an argument introduced for the first time in the annulment proceeding.\n\nSee Cl. Rej. Annulment at para. 74.\n\n133.\n\nWith respect to the validity of the transfer of the legal title to the CPP shares, the Tribunal recognized that Article 451 of the Chilean Commercial Code and Article 37 of Corporation Regulations require compliance with specific norms; the Tribunal considered that these norms must be observed to obtain a transfer of control with effect *erga omnes79* The Tribunal was not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s arguments, however, and concluded that the absence of registration in the respective Corporate Shareholders\u2019 Registry did not affect the validity of the transfer of control that is at issue here, which concerns a transfer *intra partes,80*\n\nSee Award at para. 226.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 227.\n\n134.\n\nIn its Reply on Annulment, Chile contends that the Tribunal did not state under what rule it analyzed the validity of the *intra partes* transfer of control. In the absence of any specific explanation in this regard in the Award, Chile infers that the Tribunal implicitly accepted the Claimants\u2019 arguments and erroneously applied the Chilean Civil Code.81 The Committee disagrees. The Committee does not see in the Award any reference, explicit or implicit, to the application by the Tribunal of the Chilean Civil Code to this question. The Tribunal analyzed the relevant cases and expert reports and concluded that neither the Commercial Code nor the Corporation Regulations provide for the nullity of the transfer in the event of non-compliance with the formality requirements.82\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 378.\n\nSee Award at paras. 227-228.\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee finds no manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal on these issues and, as noted above, finds that the Tribunal provided ample reasons for its findings. Chile\u2019s request is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**(2) Investment Made in Accordance with the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe parties disagreed on whether Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s investment was in fact an \"investment\" for purposes of Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the Chile-Spain BIT. Those articles required the investment to have been made \"in accordance with\" Chilean legislation and to qualify as a \"foreign\" investment under the Chilean law applicable at the time.\n\n137.\n\nChile maintains that the Tribunal was required to apply three key legal norms applicable to investments in the newspaper industry in Chile in 1972, which the Tribunal explicitly recognized were in force in Chile at the time: (1) the Chile-Spain Dual Nationality Convention, which established the concept of \"effective nationality,\" which in turn governed which of those two nations\u2019 legislations would be applicable at a given time to a Chilean-Spanish dual national; (2) Decision 24, which required that a capital contribution be made by a foreign person for an investment to qualify as a \"foreign investment\" and which barred foreign investment in the Chilean newspaper industry; and (3) Chilean Law No. 16,643, which required that owners of newspapers in Chile be Chilean.\n\n138.\n\nChile contends that these norms presented the Claimants with a \"fatal dilemma\". If Mr. Pey Casado was a foreigner at the time of his investment (1972), he could not have invested in the Chilean newspaper industry \"in accordance with Chilean law\" as required by the BIT, because foreign investment in the media industry was barred in 1972 by both Decision 24 and Law No. 16,643; on the other hand, if he was a Chilean national at the relevant time, then by definition he could not have made a \"foreign\" investment for purposes of the BIT. According to Chile, the Tribunal could not rationally at the same time deem Mr. Pey Casado to be a Chilean for purposes of Decision 24 and Law No. 16,643, and yet a Spaniard for purposes of the BIT.\n\n(i) *Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nChile argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the Chile-Spain BIT, which required that it determine whether Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s alleged investment was an investment made \"in accordance with\" Chilean law, and also whether it was a \"foreign\" investment.\n\n(ii) *Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nOn this question, Chile also argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion that Mr. Pey Casado simultaneously was a foreigner for purposes of the BIT, and yet a Chilean for purposes of the Chilean norms restricting foreign investment in the newspaper sector. In other words, the Tribunal should have provided a reasoned solution to the \"fatal dilemma\" rather than simply declaring *ex cathedra* that it was not a dilemma at all.83\n\nSee Resp. Pre-H. Skel. at p. 5.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n141.\n\nChile summarizes its position in relation to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as to the application of Decision 24 as follows:84\n\n398. Had the Tribunal applied Articles 1 and 43 of Decision 24, it necessarily would have concluded that Mr. Pey's alleged investment was not a foreign investment, but rather only a domestic one, and that as such it was not covered by the Chile-Spain BIT. This conclusion in turn would have mandated a finding that Mr. Pey's claim was barred for failure to meet the jurisdictional requirement of proving the existence of an investment covered by the BIT.\n\n399. Instead, the Tribunal decided to disregard Decision 24, on the asserted basis that, although in force, it was not adequately being enforced in Chile at the time of Mr. Pey's investment. In their Counter-Memorial, Claimants defend the Tribunal's decision. However, the fact that the Chilean government might not have established comprehensive mechanisms for enforcing all rules of Decision 24 does not mean that Decision 24 was not the applicable law in Chile at the time. It is not uncommon for new legislation to create new governmental agencies or departments and to establish new requirements that have to be processed by those agencies. It is understood that it takes time to create such governmental offices and to put in place those processes. This does not mean, however, that the whole legislation can be deemed ineffective, or can be set aside as \"not really\" constituting the governing law, until such time as implementing procedures are fully in place. The Tribunal failed to apply the proper law on this point, in a way that clearly affected the outcome of the case. This requires annulment under Article 52(1)(b).\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 398-399. Footnotes omitted.\n\n142.\n\nAs to Law 16,643, Chile submits:85\n\n404. As the Republic explained in its Memorial, it is illogical to suggest\u2014as Claimants and the Tribunal do\u2014that simply by virtue of Mr. Pey's dual nationality it was possible, on the one hand, for him to wear his *Spanish* hat when acquiring the newspaper for the purposes of the BIT, and yet at exactly the same time wear his *Chilean* hat when acquiring the newspaper for purposes of the Chilean law relating to acquisition of media companies. The Republic is not suggesting, as Claimants insinuate, that Mr. Pey's dual nationality in itself would have rendered his investments in Chile unprotected by the BIT. Rather, because of Law 16,643, any investment made specifically in the newspaper industry in 1972 *a fortiori* had to be considered a domestic investment, because foreigners were prohibited from investing in this particular business sector.\n\n405. The Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply Chilean law 16,643 and also by failing to apply Article 2(2) of the BIT. By doing so, it accepted jurisdiction over an investment that as a matter of Chilean law could not benefit from the protection of the Chile-Spain BIT. Consequently, the Award should be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 404-405. Footnotes omitted.\n\n143.\n\nFinally, Chile adds:86\n\n406. There is an additional aspect of the Tribunal's finding of a \"foreign\" investment by Mr. Pey that merits discussion. In addition to all of the problems noted above relating to Mr. Pey's legal inability at relevant times to renounce Chilean nationality and his failure to take steps to actually do so, it is also relevant that at the time of Mr. Pey's alleged investment (1972), Mr. Pey was formally domiciled in Chile pursuant to Article 2 of the Dual Nationality Convention. Under that provision, and by the Tribunal's express terms, Mr. Pey had to be deemed fully Chilean for all legal purposes : \"D\u00e8s cette inscription, les Chiliens en Espagne et les Espagnols au Chili jouiront de la pleine condition juridique des ressortissants de la fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9vue dans cet accord et dans les lois des deux pays.\" Therefore, had the Tribunal applied Article 2 of the Dual Nationality Convention to its analysis of the nature of the investment, it necessarily would have concluded that Mr. Pey's alleged investment was made as a Chilean national, and therefore could not have qualified as a foreign investment for the purposes of the BIT.\n\n407. Further, Article 3 of the Convention makes clear that \"[l]es ressortissants des deux parties Contractantes concern\u00e9es ne seront pas soumis simultan\u00e9ment aux l\u00e9gislations des deux parties en leur condition de personne naturelle de ces parties, mais uniquement \u00e0 celle o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9lu domicile.\" Therefore, as stated in the Republic's Memorial, Mr. Pey could not have acquired the newspaper and have been considered a Spanish investor for the purposes of the BIT, and yet at exactly the same time have been considered a Chilean investor for the purposes of the Chilean law relating to the acquisition of media companies. Since Mr. Pey was Chilean for all legal purposes at the time he allegedly made the investment in question, his alleged acquisition could not have constituted a \"foreign\" investment under Chilean law.\n\n408. The Tribunal's failure to apply Articles 2 and 3 of the Dual Nationality Convention had a determinative effect on the Tribunal's conclusions, because as a result [it] improperly asserted jurisdiction over an investment that could not have qualified as a foreign investment under the relevant Chilean law as required by Article 2(2) of the BIT. As a result, it also failed to apply Article 2(2) of the BIT, and it manifestly exceeded its powers, which compels annulment of the Award. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 406-408. Footnotes omitted.\n\n144.\n\nAs to its contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in respect of this issue, Chile submits that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in paragraph 410 of the Award87 cannot explain its conclusion that the posited dilemma was not fatal to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s ICSID claim.88\n\nSee Award at para. 410: \u00ab Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la D\u00e9cision n\u00b024 n\u2019avait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 jamais fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une application effective au Chili. Le dilemme mis en \u00e9vidence par la d\u00e9fenderesse ne s\u2019est donc jamais r\u00e9ellement pos\u00e9. En 1972, lorsque M. Pey Casado a effectu\u00e9 son investissement, il \u00e9tait titulaire de la double nationalit\u00e9 hispano-chilienne. R\u00e9sidant au Chili depuis 1947, M. Pey Casado b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de la Convention sur la double nationalit\u00e9 depuis 1958. La loi n\u00b016,643 ne contenant pas de disposition sp\u00e9cifique relative aux doubles nationaux, la situation de M. Pey Casado \u00e9tait donc tout \u00e0 fait compatible avec les dispositions de ce texte. \u00bb\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 478 *et seq.*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimants reject Chile\u2019s contention regarding Decision 24 in the following words:89\n\n405. Tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a soutenu que les investissements \u00e9trangers \u00e9taient r\u00e9gis par la D\u00e9cision 24 du Pacte de Carthag\u00e8ne entr\u00e9e en vigueur au Chili en 1971, conform\u00e9ment aux d\u00e9crets n\u00b0 482 et 488. D\u00e8s lors, pour \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'investissement \u00e9tranger, il convenait de d\u00e9montrer l'existence de transferts de capitaux vers le Chili, par une personne n'ayant pas la nationalit\u00e9 chilienne. En outre, l'investissement devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9alablement autoris\u00e9 et enregistr\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes. Ne remplissant aucune de ces conditions, l'investissement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par Monsieur Pey en 1972 ne pouvait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'investissement \u00e9tranger selon la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation du Chili.\n\n406. La position des Demanderesses concernant l'application de la D\u00e9cision 24 du Pacte de Carthag\u00e8ne est r\u00e9sum\u00e9e aux paragraphes 356 \u00e0 360 de la Sentence.\n\n407. De fait, la question de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur et de l'application effective de la D\u00e9cision 24 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s largement d\u00e9battue par les Parties.\n\n408. Comme l'indique justement la R\u00e9publique du Chili dans son M\u00e9moire en annulation, le Tribunal arbitral, apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les arguments des deux Parties, a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la D\u00e9cision 24 issue du Pacte de Carthag\u00e8ne \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e en vigueur au Chili.\n\n409. Partant, le Tribunal a continu\u00e9 d'analyser l'argumentaire des Parties sur la D\u00e9cision 24. Il indique ainsi, *\u00ab dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la D\u00e9cision n\u00b024 serait entr\u00e9e en vigueur, les Demanderesses* ont *toutefois fait valoir que l'application pratique de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b024 exigeait l\u2019adoption d\u2019un certain nombre de mesures qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence la D\u00e9cision n\u00b024 n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement appliqu\u00e9e \u00bb.*\n\n410. Aujourd'hui, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, la R\u00e9publique du Chili reproche au Tribunal arbitral d'avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cet exercice. Selon elle, le Tribunal arbitral aurait d\u00fb appliquer les dispositions de la D\u00e9cision 24 sans rechercher si celle-ci \u00e9tait effectivement appliqu\u00e9e, comme le lui demandaient les Demanderesses.\n\n411. Cet argument est curieux. Il consiste \u00e0 soutenir que le Tribunal aurait d\u00fb appliquer les dispositions de la D\u00e9cision 24 \u00e0 l'investissement de Monsieur Pey sans se soucier de savoir si ces dispositions \u00e9taient effectivement appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les investissements \u00e9trangers au Chili \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. En d'autres termes, l'investissement de Monsieur Pey aurait d\u00fb recevoir un traitement sp\u00e9cial, discriminatoire, par rapport aux autres investissements \u00e9trangers.\n\n412. La R\u00e9publique du Chili ne peut s\u00e9rieusement reprocher au Tribunal arbitral de s'\u00eatre assur\u00e9 de l'application concr\u00e8te et effective des dispositions de la D\u00e9cision 24. Elle ne peut pas non plus demander au Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* de sanctionner la Sentence sur ce fondement. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 405-412. Footnotes omitted.\n\n146.\n\nAs for Chile\u2019s contention regarding Law 16,643, the Claimants submit:90\n\n417. S'agissant du pr\u00e9tendu dilemme soulev\u00e9 par la R\u00e9publique du Chili, le Tribunal arbitral pr\u00e9cise \u00ab le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la D\u00e9cision n\u00b024 n'avait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 jamais fait l'objet d'une application effective au Chili. Le dilemme mis en \u00e9vidence par la d\u00e9fenderesse ne s'est donc jamais r\u00e9ellement pos\u00e9 \u00bb.\n\n418. Aujourd'hui, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, la R\u00e9publique du Chili pr\u00e9tend que le dilemme en question concerne l'incompatibilit\u00e9 du respect des dispositions de la loi 16,643 et la qualit\u00e9 d'investisseur \u00e9tranger au sens de l'API. Elle soutient que pour \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'investissement \u00e9tranger, Monsieur Pey devait avoir effectu\u00e9 son investissement en qualit\u00e9 d'espagnol en 1972.\n\n419. Ce n'est pas ce qu'a retenu le Tribunal dans sa Sentence. En effet, le Tribunal constate que l'API retient une \u00ab conception large de la notion d'investissement \u00bb la seule condition \u00e9tant \u00ab celle de l'acquisition en conformit\u00e9 au droit de l'Etat d'accueil \u00bb.\n\n420. Or, le Tribunal a constat\u00e9 que le droit chilien ne contenait pas de disposition d\u00e9finissant l'investissement \u00e9tranger et que celui-ci ne devait pas remplir de condition particuli\u00e8re. La loi 16,643 de 1967 quant \u00e0 elle ne concerne pas l'investissement. Elle impose simplement aux propri\u00e9taires de journaux d'\u00eatre de nationalit\u00e9 chilienne, condition remplie par Monsieur Pey en raison de sa double nationalit\u00e9 en application de la CDN de 1958. La R\u00e9publique du Chili ne peut donc s'appuyer sur la loi 16,643 pour d\u00e9montrer que l'investissement de Monsieur Pey n'\u00e9tait pas un investissement \u00e9tranger au sens de l'API.\n\n421. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la R\u00e9publique du Chili entretient volontairement une confusion entre diff\u00e9rentes notions, l'application *ratione materiae* et l'application *ratione personae* de l'API. Or, l'argument du Chili ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 concerne l'application *ratione personae* de l'API. A cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'API ne contenait pas de disposition sp\u00e9cifique aux double-nationaux. Il a \u00e9galement conclu qu' \u00ab *un double-national n'est pas exclu du champ de l'API, m\u00eame si sa nationalit\u00e9 \u2018effective et dominante' est celle de l'Etat de l'investissement (contrairement*  *et*  *ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu dans l'avis de droit du Professeur Dolzer, produit par la d\u00e9fenderesse) \u00bb.* En outre, le Tribunal arbitral a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que \u00ab *contrairement*  *et*  *l'article 25 de la Convention CIRDI, l'API ne pr\u00e9cise pas le moment de l'appr\u00e9ciation de la nationalit\u00e9 de la partie requ\u00e9rante. De l'avis du Tribunal, la condition de nationalit\u00e9 au sens de l'API doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie*  *et*  *la date du consentement de l'investisseur*  *et*  *l'arbitrage \u00bb.*\n\n422. La position du Tribunal arbitral sur la condition d'application *ratione personae* n'est donc en rien incompatible avec sa d\u00e9cision concernant le respect de la loi chilienne 16,643 relative \u00e0 l'abus de publicit\u00e9.\n\n423. Contrairement \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation du Chili, le Tribunal arbitral a bien appliqu\u00e9 le droit chilien pour d\u00e9terminer si l'investissement de Monsieur Pey avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 au droit chilien. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 417-423. Footnotes omitted.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly refute Chile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in this regard.91\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 439-448.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThis is a complex question. It was recognized as such by the Tribunal which analyzed all facets of the question and considered all of the parties\u2019 arguments in a very thorough manner. Chile may not agree with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions but once again it bears stating that this is not an appeal but an annulment proceeding, and it is not the role of an annulment committee to act as a court of appeal. As explained below, the Committee can see no manifest excess of power in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions with respect to Decision 24, Law 16,643 or the Dual Nationality Convention. In addition, the Committee finds that the Tribunal provided ample and indeed very detailed reasons to support its conclusions.\n\n149.\n\nContrary to Chile\u2019s assertion, the Committee considers that the Tribunal applied the \"proper law\", *i.e.,* Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT as well as the Chilean law to which these provisions refer. This is clearly stated by the Tribunal in paragraph 370 of the Award. In the same paragraph, the Tribunal determined that the applicable law was Chilean law in force in 1972, at the time the investment was made.\n\n150.\n\nAccording to Chile, the applicable Chilean law consisted of three norms applicable to the newspaper industry. One of these norms is known as Decision 24.92 The Tribunal recognized that this Decision was in force in Chile but, on the basis of the evidence submitted by the parties, it found that, by 1972, Decision 24 had not been effectively applied by Chile \"...[vu] l'absence d\u2019adoption des mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin...\".93 For these reasons, the Tribunal concluded that Decision 24 was ineffective.\n\nDocument approved in 1970 by the Commission created by the Cartagena Accord (multilateral regional integration treaty to which Chile is a party) regarding common regime for the treatment of foreign capital in the Contracting States to the Accord.\n\nSee Award at para. 401; see also paras. 397-398.\n\n151.\n\nChile argues that, by finding that Decision 24 was ineffective because it had not been applied in Chile, the Tribunal added a requirement to Article 2(2) of the BIT and, consequently failed to apply the proper law. It is not within the Committee\u2019s mandate to determine whether or not the Tribunal was justified in taking into account the effectiveness of Decision 24 in order to decide whether it was part of the *\"l\u00e9gislation de la Partie contractante concern\u00e9e\"* as required by Article 2(2) of the BIT. In any case, the Committee notes that the Tribunal went on to analyse the regulations which Decision 24 was meant to replace and found that they were not applicable to the investment made by Mr. Pey Casado.94\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 402-408.\n\n152.\n\nThe second norm discussed by Chile is Law 16,643 which requires that the owners of Chilean newspapers be Chilean nationals. Chile argued that this law is relevant to determine whether the investment was \"acquired in accordance with the law\" of Chile as required in Article 1(2) of the BIT. As noted earlier in this Decision, Chile claimed that the Claimants faced a \"fatal dilemma\" at the time the investment was made: acquiring the newspaper as a Spanish investor for the purposes of Decision 24 and, at the same time acquiring the newspaper as a Chilean investor for the purposes of Law 16,643. The Tribunal resolved any issue in this regard very simply. No such dilemma existed, said the Tribunal, for the reason that (as noted above) Decision 24 was not applicable. Additionally, the Tribunal stated that, when the investment was made, Mr. Pey Casado was a dual national and, since Law 16,643 did not include any specific provision regarding dual nationals, the investment was perfectly compatible with such law.95 In the view of the Committee, by thus interpreting Law 16,643, the Tribunal applied the proper law.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 410.\n\n153.\n\nChile also contends that a dilemma arises by virtue of the requirement of Law 16,643 that a newspaper owner be Chilean, and the requirement of Article 2(2) of the BIT that an investment be \"foreign\" (independently of Decision 24). In this connection, Chile submits that the Tribunal failed to apply Articles 2 and 3 of the Dual Nationality Convention, which is the third norm referred to by Chile.\n\n154.\n\nChile submits that, pursuant to the provisions referred to in the preceding paragraph, since Mr. Pey Casado was domiciled in Chile in 1972, he is to be treated as a Chilean national for all legal purposes. Chile asserts that, had the Tribunal applied these provisions, it would necessarily have found that the investment was in fact Chilean and not \"foreign\" for purposes of the BIT. The Claimants answer that this argument was never raised before the Tribunal.\n\n155.\n\nWhether or not Chile raised this argument before the Tribunal, the Committee notes that the Tribunal interpreted Article 2(2) of the BIT as requiring that it determine whether Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s acquisition of the CPP shares constituted a \"foreign\" investment according to the applicable Chilean law in 1972. In the context of that determination, and as the Committee has already observed above, the Tribunal found that the applicable law did not include Decision 24, that Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s situation did not fall within the scope of the other decrees that Decision 24 was meant to replace and that Law 16,643 was not incompatible with Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s dual nationality. The Tribunal then concluded that there was no specific definition of a \"foreign\" investment in Chile in 1972 and that, since Mr. Pey Casado had purchased the shares and paid for them using a foreign currency drawn on European bank accounts, his investment could thus be treated as \"foreign\" and in conformity with Article 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT.96 Accordingly, the Tribunal did not need to decide whether Mr. Pey Casado had made the investment as a Spanish national or a Chilean national or a dual national in order for the investment to be considered \"foreign\".\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 411.\n\n156.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion in this respect is consistent with what it decided in the subsequent paragraphs of the Award with respect to the question of nationality under the BIT.97 The Tribunal determined that the dates on which the nationality requirement of the BIT had to be met were the date on which Mr. Pey Casado gave his consent to arbitration and the date on which the alleged breaches of the BIT occurred, not the date on which the investment was made.98 The Tribunal also concluded that the BIT, unlike the ICSID Convention, does not bar a dual national from bringing a claim against his or her own State.99 In these circumstances, the Committee finds that the Tribunal applied the proper law.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 412-418.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 414.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 415.\n\n157.\n\nThe Committee sees no manifest excess of powers in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions with respect to Decision 24, Law 16,643 or the Dual Nationality Convention. The Committee finds that the Tribunal provided ample and very detailed reasons to support its conclusions in this respect.\n\n158.\n\nChile\u2019s requests are accordingly denied.\n\n**(3) The** ***Ratione Temporis*** **Application of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nChile\u2019s starting point in this regard is that the only investment of the Claimants was their investment in *El Clar\u00edn.* The Tribunal concluded in the Award that *El Clar\u00edn* had been definitively expropriated by no later than 1975: first *de facto,* by means of the physical seizure of the newspaper facilities in 1973, and then *de jure,* by means of an expropriatory decree promulgated in 1975. The Tribunal also concluded that the expropriation had been instantaneous, expressly rejecting Claimants\u2019 argument that it constituted a \"continuing act\" and thus an ongoing violation at the time the BIT entered into force. Further, the Tribunal determined that the post-BIT acts by Chile that it ultimately considered to be treaty violations \u2014 namely, the execution of Decision No. 43 and the alleged denial of justice in connection with the Goss printer proceedings \u2014 were completely separate and distinct from the 1975 expropriation. Specifically, the Award stated: \"The confiscation and transfer to the State of the property of the assets of CPP and EPC constitute a consummated and distinct act from the violations that post-dated the BIT\u2019s entry into force [...]\".100\n\n*lb id.* at para. 620.\n\n160.\n\nIn the words of Chile in its Skeleton (at page 6), \"since *El Clar\u00edn* had been definitively expropriated by 1975, Claimants had no remaining investment in Chile by the time of the BIT\u2019s entry into force (1994) and *a fortiori* no investment by the date of the alleged post-BIT acts for which the Tribunal found Chile responsible\".\n\n(i) *Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s own conclusion that Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s investment in *El Clar\u00edn* had been fully extinguished upon its expropriation in the 1970s, the main issue raised by Chile in connection with Article 52(1)(b) is whether the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law (Article 2(2) of the BIT) by not identifying the investment still owned by the Claimants which could have been affected by the acts and omissions deemed to constitute BIT violations.\n\n(ii) *Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in connection with Article 52(1)(e) is whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for asserting jurisdiction over alleged harm to an investment that, by the Tribunal\u2019s own reasoning, had been extinguished more than twenty years prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into force, and therefore could not have constituted an \"existing investment\" either at that time, or at the time of the subsequent State acts that the Tribunal considered to be the basis for liability.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n163.\n\nChile\u2019s sets out its submission that the Tribunal failed to apply Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT in the following words:101\n\n416. Here, the Republic asserts that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it improperly asserted jurisdiction over alleged post-BIT acts by Chile that could not have affected any investment of Claimants, for the simple reason that Claimants had no investment still existing at the time of the alleged acts. The Tribunal correctly noted at the outset of its analysis in the Award that Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT permitted claims only for investments that were \"already existing at the time of entry into force of the BIT\":\n\nIl est clair, en revanche, que les Articles 1(2) et 2(2) de TAPI exigent de l'investisseur qu'il effectue un investissement qui soit conforme \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation chilienne en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et, s'agissant d'investissements existant au moment de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9, qui puisse \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'investissement \u00e9tranger au sens de cette l\u00e9gislation.\n\n417. The foregoing necessarily means that an investment that had terminated before the date of the BIT's entry into force *(i.e.,* that was no longer \"existing\" on that date) would be outside the scope of the BIT. However, and incongruously, the Tribunal then failed to identify an investment by Mr. Pey that was still \"existing\" upon entry into force of the Chile-Spain BIT in 1994. In other words, having first articulated correctly what the BIT required by way of analysis for application of Articles 1(2) and 2(2), it then simply failed to apply such requirements to Claimants.\n\n418. It bears recalling that the investment Mr. Pey allegedly made ceased altogether to exist in 1973, upon the *de facto* confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn,* or at the latest in 1975, upon the issuance of Decree No. 165 formally expropriating *El Clar\u00edn* and definitively dissolving the relevant corporate entities (CPP and EPC). The Tribunal itself conceded this key point when it concluded that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* was an \"instantaneous\" act that concluded when it happened in the 1970s. This means necessarily that Claimants' investment was extinguished at that time. The Tribunal did not purport to suggest that the \"investment\" somehow continued to exist independently of the property that was expropriated, or that every subsequent disposition by the Government of the expropriated property constituted a new \"expropriation\" affecting the original owners. To the contrary, the Tribunal's conclusion was precisely the opposite: that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* was not a \"continuing\" act.\n\n419. Given the Tribunal's conclusions in this regard, it is impossible to discern what \"investment\" the Republic harmed when it undertook the acts that the Tribunal concluded were post-entry into force violations of the BIT. The Tribunal simply does not address this issue at all in the Award. But if *El Clar\u00edn* was expropriated definitively at the latest by 1975, as the Tribunal conceded, and if Claimants furthermore did not allege the existence of any other investment, what investment by Claimants could possibly have existed past 1994, the year the BIT entered into force? What was the investment that was harmed by the post-1994 acts that formed the basis of the Tribunal's finding of responsibility against Chile?\n\n420. The Tribunal assumed jurisdiction despite the fundamental logical and legal flaws identified above, eliding the absence of an investment and then ruling in Claimants' favor. The Republic could not have foreseen this outcome during the underlying proceedings, as no acts other than the expropriation itself had been the subject of a claim in the arbitration. Claimants had argued that the expropriation of their original investment should be deemed a \"continuing\" one that for that reason should be deemed to exist past the date of the BIT's entry into force, but they had never argued either (a) that the investment *itself* was somehow a \"continuing\" one; or (b) that they had made some other (different) investment that was covered by the BIT and that was harmed by Chile's purported post-BIT acts.\n\n421. Accordingly, there was no reason for Chile to make any arguments in this regard, and no way it could have predicted that the Tribunal would rule in Claimants' favor on the basis of events that occurred long after Mr. Pey's investment, which by the Tribunal's own reasoning had long before been definitively extinguished. It was only upon reviewing the Award that the Republic realized this fundamental inconsistency of the Tribunal's ruling, and that it had based its finding of responsibility on alleged post-1994 violations without identifying any investment still existing at the time of those acts. Claimants' waiver argument therefore fails.\n\n422. Claimants also now contend, in their Counter-Memorial, that despite the language of the treaty, and despite the Tribunal's acceptance that such language required an \"existing\" investment at the time of the BIT's entry into force, the BIT in fact does not require that the alleged investment still be in existence at the time of the BIT violation. They therefore apparently argue that it is possible to breach a particular BIT even if there is no investment in place that is subject to the BIT's protection. This is an unsustainable position, because it means that any investment made at any point in the past (no matter how long before the BIT's entry into force) somehow continues to enjoy protection under the BIT *ad aeternitatem.* As a matter of logic and common sense, this cannot be correct; more importantly for purposes of this annulment proceeding, and in particular of the question of manifest excess of powers, it is directly at odds with the actual treaty language. As the Tribunal noted, the BIT requires an \"existing\" investment at the time of the BIT's entry into force, and yet, it failed to identify any investment owned by Claimants that was still \"existing\" in 1994. This clear failure by the Tribunal to apply Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT was a manifest excess of powers, which compels annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 416-422. Footnotes omitted.\n\n164.\n\nIn connection with its contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in this regard, Chile states:102\n\n485. The Tribunal also failed to state reasons on what the \"existing investment\" was; *i.e.* what investment Mr. Pey still had in Chile at the time the BIT entered into force and/or at the time the Republic undertook the challenged post-BIT acts. On this issue, the Tribunal reached the following conclusions in the Award:\n\n(1) Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT required that there be an *existing investment* by Mr. Pey in 1994, when the BIT entered into force; and (2) the *El Clar\u00edn* newspaper had been completely expropriated\u2014and thus the relevant investment had become extinguished\u2014by 1975 at the latest; (3) the expropriation was instantaneous, and thus contrary to Claimants' argument, it did not constitute a violation that was still continuing at the time the BIT entered into force; and (4) the post-BIT acts by Chile that the Tribunal ultimately found to be treaty violations\u2014Decision 43 and the alleged delay in local court proceedings regarding the Goss Machine\u2014were completely different, and distinct from, the 1975 expropriation.\n\n486. As a matter of pure logic, the foregoing cumulus of conclusions should have led the Tribunal to conclude that Mr. Pey had no investment that was still an existing one in 1994, at the time the BIT entered into force, and that therefore there was no proper basis for exercising jurisdiction over Mr. Pey's claim. Yet the Tribunal simply proceeded to assert jurisdiction without explaining its solution to the foregoing conundrum. It did not explain if it was basing its assertion of jurisdiction on some theory that the investment made in *El Clar\u00edn* was somehow a \"continuing\" one even though, as explained above, it had determined that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* had been definitely completed and terminated no later than 1975. But on the other hand, the Tribunal also did not explain if it was basing its assertion of jurisdiction on the existence of a *different* investment; that is, some *other* investment by Mr. Pey or by the President Allende Foundation\u2014aside from the long-extinguished *El Clar\u00edn* investment\u2014that could have been deemed to exist in 1994, when the BIT entered into force, or after that, when Chile committed the post-BIT acts that the Tribunal found objectionable. Instead, the Tribunal simply assumed\u2014without any explanation or reasoning\u2014the existence of some investment: \"En revanche, les dispositions de fond de l'API sont applicables *ratione temporis* \u00e0 la violation r\u00e9sultant de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 et au d\u00e9ni de justice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les demanderesse[s], ces actes \u00e9tant post[\u00e9]rieurs \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9.\"\n\n487. The Tribunal seemingly contented itself with noting that it had the authority to take into consideration pre-BIT events in order to give context to the post-BIT acts. However, this did not give the Tribunal the authority to elevate to the status of an \"existing\" investment one that, by the Tribunal's own finding, had been clearly extinguished long before the BIT's entry into force.

S'agissant du point de savoir si l'investissement effectu\u00e9 par Monsieur Pey en 1972 \u00e9tait couvert par l'API, le Tribunal fonde sa d\u00e9cision sur l'article 2.2 de l'API qui pr\u00e9voit :\n\n*Le pr\u00e9sent Trait\u00e9 s'appliquera aux investissements qui seraient r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de son entr\u00e9e en vigueur par des investisseurs de l'une des Parties contractantes dans le territoire de l'autre.*  *Toutefois, il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera \u00e9galement aux investissements r\u00e9alis\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e en vigueur et qui, selon la l\u00e9gislation de la Partie contractante concern\u00e9e, auraient la qualit\u00e9 d'investissement \u00e9tranger* *. (Emphasis added)*\n\n434. Or, rien dans cet article [de l'API] n'impose que l'investissement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 existe encore \u00e0 la date de la violation par l'Etat d'accueil. Il impose seulement que l'investissement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation en vigueur dans l'Etat d'accueil \u00e0 la date de l'investissement. Le Tribunal a conclu que tel \u00e9tait le cas.\n\n435. L'argument de la D\u00e9fenderesse consiste \u00e0 imposer un crit\u00e8re suppl\u00e9mentaire dans la d\u00e9finition des investissements prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l'API. Or, comme l'a indiqu\u00e9 le Tribunal arbitral \u00e0 propos de la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab investissement \u00bb \u00ab *une* *telle d\u00e9marche serait de toute \u00e9vidence contraire \u00e0 l'article 31 de la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des trait\u00e9s \u00bb.*\n\n436. En outre, l'imposition d'une telle condition suppl\u00e9mentaire contrevient \u00e0 l'objet m\u00eame du droit international de protection des investissements. En effet, suivre l'argument de la R\u00e9publique du Chili \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 vider de son sens tout trait\u00e9 de protection des investissements.\n\n437. Ceci a d'ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 dans plusieurs affaires port\u00e9es devant des tribunaux arbitraux CIRDI et encore r\u00e9cemment dans la sentence rendue le 15 avril 2009 dans l'affaire *Phoenix Action Ltd c/ La R\u00e9publique Tch\u00e8que* qui pr\u00e9cise :\n\n*It is true that an investment that has come to a standstill, because of the host State 's actions, would still qualify as an investment, otherwise the international protection of foreign investment provided by BITs would be emptied of its purpose.*\n\n438. Il r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9veloppements pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* devra rejeter la demande d'annulation de la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur ce fondement celle-ci \u00e9tant irrecevable et \u00e0 tout le moins mal fond\u00e9e.

Footnotes omitted.\n\n166.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants refute Chile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in this regard.104\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 439 *et seq.*\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants. It is not within the remit of the Committee to state that it agrees with the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusion on any issue (although it does on this particular question). However, it is strictly within its remit to review the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusion on every issue raised by the Respondent, as it has done, and to determine, with respect of these specific grounds, that the Tribunal has not exceeded its powers nor failed to provide reasons.\n\n168.\n\nThe Committee notes that this argument of the \"existing investment\" had not been raised by Chile before the Tribunal. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that for the purposes of the grounds invoked, the Tribunal applied Article 2(2) of the BIT and the applicable Chilean law to conclude that the investment made by Mr. Pey Casado in 1972 was covered by the BIT.105 In addition, the Committee agrees with the Claimants that one could have made the argument that the duty to provide redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end,106 as long as the relevant treaty obligation was in force for the State concerned at the time of the alleged breach.107 These principles were followed by the Tribunal in the section of the Award dedicated to the application of the BIT *ratione temporis*.108 The Committee finds that the Tribunal did not expressly deal with the question of the existing investment as it was not raised in these terms by the parties in the arbitral proceeding. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot be considered as having failed to provide reasons. The Respondent\u2019s request for annulment on the basis of this challenge is accordingly dismissed.\n\nSee Award at paras. 431-432.\n\nSee *Jan de Nul NV and Dredging International NV v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 16 June 2006, at para. 135.\n\nSee *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award dated 11 October 2002, at para. 68 (hereinafter *\"Mondev Award\").*\n\nSee Award at paras. 419-466.\n\n**(4) The Investment by the Foundation - Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in this connection is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law \u2014 Article 1(2) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention \u2014 to determine whether the cession to the Fundaci\u00f3n of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s claim rights constituted a qualifying \"investment\" for purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n170.\n\nChile states its position as follows:109\n\n411. The Republic could not have anticipated during the arbitral proceeding that in its Award, the Tribunal would confuse a transfer of shares for ownership purposes with the mere transfer of litigation rights, and that in doing so, it would fail to analyze the real nature of the Foundation\u2019s alleged investment as a matter of Chilean law. This, like other annullable errors, became evident to the Republic only upon review of the Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n[...]\n\n413. Chile\u2019s analysis in the Memorial of whether the claim rights received by the Foundation from Mr. Pey could qualify as an investment was based on the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the Award regarding Mr. Pey\u2019s alleged investment. As Claimants concede, the Tribunal itself acknowledged a requirement of analyzing whether the Foundation fulfilled the jurisdictional requirements established by the ICSID Convention and the Chile-Spain BIT. However, the Tribunal failed to assess whether the claim rights received by Foundation could in and of themselves qualify as an investment. In its Memorial, the Republic applied to the Foundation the *same* standard that the Tribunal used to determine whether Mr. Pey\u2019s alleged acquisition qualified as an investment, and demonstrated that the Tribunal had not applied to the Foundation its own standard to determine whether the Foundation held an \"investment\" covered by the BIT. Claimants have not responded to the Republic\u2019s arguments on this issue. For example, Claimants did not meaningfully controvert the Republic\u2019s assertion that the Tribunal failed to analyze whether the Foundation\u2019s alleged investment fulfilled the requirements established by the ICSID Convention and the Chile-Spain BIT.\n\n414. Had the Tribunal performed with respect to the Foundation\u2019s alleged investment the same analysis that it had applied to Mr. Pey\u2019s alleged investment, it necessarily would have concluded that the litigation rights transferred by Mr. Pey to the Foundation did not qualify as an investment, either under the provisions of the Chile-Spain BIT\u2014Article 1(2)\u2014or under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by asserting jurisdiction over an alleged \"investment\" by the Foundation that clearly did not arise out of any activity that could be considered an \"investment\" under either the ICSID Convention or the BIT. The Award must therefore be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention for this reason. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 411; 413-414. Footnotes omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimants dispute Chile\u2019s submission in this regard in the following words:110\n\n454. Au contraire, le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 *\"la cession des actions n\u2019a transmis que la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019investisseur \u00e0 la Fondation, et non pas de ce fait et n\u00e9cessairement le droit de r\u00e9clamation. Pour* d\u00e9cider *du sort des objections d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence soulev\u00e9es par la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Fondation Pr\u00e9sident Allende, le Tribunal arbitral doit donc analyser la question de savoir si la Fondation Pr\u00e9sident Allende remplit toutes les autres conditions pos\u00e9es tant par la Convention CIRDI que par l'API quant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal arbitral. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ceci concerne notamment les conditions de nationalit\u00e9 au sens de la Convention CIRDI ainsi que le consentement des Parties \u00e0 recourir \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage CIRDI pour r\u00e9soudre leur litige\".*\n\n[...]\n\n458. De fait, la R\u00e9publique du Chili tente une fois de plus d\u2019interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal arbitral devant le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* en vue de son infirmation. Le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* rejettera donc la demande d\u2019annulation du Chili sur ce fondement. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 454; 458. Footnotes omitted.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n172.\n\nHere again, the Committee agrees with the Claimants. In the view of the Committee, this is yet another attempt by the Respondent to appeal to the Committee that it should overturn the decision of the Tribunal and rule, in its stead, that the rights received by the Foundation from Mr. Pey Casado do not qualify as an investment. This, the Committee will not do. The Respondent attempts to challenge the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that there was a transfer of shares by Mr. Pey Casado to the Foundation that gave the latter the status of investor. Respondent argues that the shares had ceased to exist and, therefore, could not have been transferred. It concludes that Mr. Pey Casado could only have transferred litigation or claims rights that would not qualify as an investment. After having reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal came to a different conclusion, namely that the Foundation had acquired the status of an investor.111 This meant that the investment remained the same and accordingly, there was no need for the Tribunal to re-examine whether the rights transferred to the Foundation qualified as an investment under the BIT\u2019s provisions and the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal summarizes its position at paragraph 558 of the Award:\n\n558. Cette conclusion est renforc\u00e9e par le fait que, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, la Fondation Allende a obtenu la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019investisseur par la cession de la part de l\u2019investisseur initial, M. Pey Casado, d\u2019une grande partie de son investissement. A ce propos, les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles que le Tribunal arbitral a \u00e9nonc\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la notion d\u2019investissement au sens de l\u2019article 25 de la Convention CIRDI s\u2019appliquent. Compte tenu de la r\u00e9daction tr\u00e8s large de l\u2019API, une interpr\u00e9tation plus stricte ne se justifierait pas. En particulier, l\u2019API ne requiert pas que l\u2019investisseur ait fait l\u2019investissement lui-m\u00eame, ce qui laisse ouverte la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un investissement (et la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019investisseur) puisse r\u00e9sulter d\u2019une cession de la part de l\u2019investisseur initial.\n\nSee Award at para. 543.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal did not exceed its powers and the Award will not be annulled on this ground. The Respondent\u2019s request is accordingly denied.\n\n**C. Denial of Justice**\n------------------------\n\n**(1) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *Denial of the Right to be Heard*\n-------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nChile contends that, contrary to Article 52(1)(d), the Tribunal denied it the right to be heard on the Claimants\u2019 alleged denial of justice which ultimately gave rise to responsibility under the Award. Thus, as a threshold matter, Chile\u2019s challenge in this regard raises the issue of whether the Claimants asserted the denial of justice claim for which the Tribunal found Chile responsible. It is recalled that the Tribunal found that Chile \"a viol\u00e9 son obligation de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les demanderesses d\u2019un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, en ce compris celle de s\u2019abstenir de tout d\u00e9ni de justice\". The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion in this regard is further set forth at paragraph 674 of the Award:\n\n674. Dans le cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, en accordant des compensations - pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elle paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqu\u00e9s, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a manifestement commis un d\u00e9ni de justice et refus\u00e9 de traiter les demanderesses de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n175.\n\nChile argues that Claimants never alleged post-entry into force BIT violations related to denial of justice (Article 4 of the BIT). Consequently, the Republic was not afforded the opportunity to present defenses, evidence, or witnesses in respect of these claims.112\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 88. Footnote omitted.\n\n176.\n\nChile contends as follows:113\n\n64. Claimants do not dispute that in the May 2008 Award, the Tribunal concluded that the BIT\u2019s substantive provisions could not apply to the confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn* because the relevant expropriatory actions had predated the BIT\u2019s entry into force in 1994. However, the Tribunal also concluded that the BIT could in fact be applied to certain alleged BIT violations by Chile that occurred *after* the Chile-Spain BIT entered into force.\n\n65. The Tribunal found Chile liable to Mr. Pey under the fair and equitable treatment provision of the Chile-Spain BIT (Article 4) as a result of two such alleged post-entry-into-force violations. The first was an alleged procedural denial of justice due to an \"undue delay\" by the First Civil Court of Santiago in deciding Mr. Pey\u2019s claim for the 1973 confiscation of a Goss printing press that belonged to *El Clar\u00edn.* The second related to an administrative decision\u2014 known as \"Decision 43\"\u2014that was rendered in Chile by the Ministry of National Assets following an administrative proceeding pursuant to a law enacted to compensate victims of Pinochet-era expropriations. In the particular proceeding that resulted in Decision 43\u2014which was distinct and unrelated to the judicial proceeding concerning the Goss machine\u2014the successors of the four registered shareholders of *El Clar\u00edn* had sought compensation from the State for the confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn.* It is important to recall in this regard that Chilean authorities had specifically invited Mr. Pey\u2014in writing\u2014to take part in this proceeding. However, Mr. Pey had voluntarily and expressly declined to participate (so as to not run afoul of the fork-in-the-road provision of the Chile-Spain BIT and thereby prejudice his ICSID claim).\n\n66. At the conclusion of the relevant administrative process, the Chilean Ministry of National Assets issued \"Decision 43,\" in which it authorized compensation to the successors of the registered shareholders of *El Clar\u00edn* (a determination that the Republic continues to consider was correct, because the relevant beneficiaries were able to prove ownership of the CPP shares under Chilean law). Shortly after the issuance of Decision 43, Mr. Pey asked the ICSID Tribunal for provisional measures enjoining its execution. However, the Tribunal rejected this request, explaining that *\"la D\u00e9cision Minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 43 et son ex\u00e9cution au Chili n\u2019ont pas des cons\u00e9quences telles qu\u2019elles puissent affecter ou la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal Arbitral CIRDI, ou les droits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par les Parties demanderesses*... \" Later, however, and wholly inconsistently with its Provisional Measures decision, the Tribunal was to hold in the Award that the execution of Decision 43\u2014that is, the compensation of persons other than Mr. Pey for the confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn\u2014* had discriminated against Mr. Pey on the basis of his nationality, in violation of the fair and equitable treatment provision of the Chile-Spain BIT.\n\n67. Claimants in their Counter-Memorial seek to sow confusion by blurring the lines between the alleged claims relating to the Goss printer and Decision 43 *(i.e.,* the \"denial of justice\" claim and the \"discrimination\" claim, respectively). The truth is that these two issues are\u2014and were found by the Tribunal to be\u2014 completely distinct. While Claimants complained in the arbitration that Decision 43 was unfair by calling it a \"denial of justice,\" the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s finding of \"denial of justice\" in the Award (as opposed to its finding of \"discrimination\") was wholly unrelated to Decision 43. Rather, such finding related solely to the *length* of the Goss machine proceeding. Accordingly, it is important that the Committee members examine carefully\u2014and in context\u2014the passages that Claimants cite as evidence that they in fact asserted the alleged denial of justice claim for which the Tribunal found Chile liable. The Committee needs to determine what exactly it is that Claimants were referring to in those instances in which they used the term \"denial of justice\" at various times in the arbitration, and then to determine whether the intended meaning in such instances matches the alleged claim upon which the Award actually was based.\n\n68. As Chile explained in its Request for Annulment and in its Memorial, it was not afforded an opportunity to be heard regarding either of the two alleged claims on which the Tribunal based its Award. It was precluded from responding to the denial of justice \"claim\" because: (1) Claimants at no point asserted any denial of justice claim specifically relating to the delay in the Goss machine proceeding (which was the sole basis of the Tribunal\u2019s finding of responsibility due to \"denial of justice\"); and (2) Claimants purported to assert a vague \"denial of justice\" claim concerning the Goss Machine proceedings only on the final day of the final hearing. Moreover, the vague denial of justice \"claim\" was purportedly raised at a hearing that Claimants concede had been convened to address \"questions portant exclusivement sur la comp\u00e9tence,\" and which therefore was an inappropriate context for raising any new merit claim. [...] [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 64-68. Footnotes omitted.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to Chile, the denial of justice claim was introduced as a free-standing claim for the first time upon prompting from the Tribunal at the hearing held in January 2007.114 However, the parties were never afforded the opportunity to submit their arguments in respect of this claim.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 218. Footnote omitted.\n\n178.\n\nExamining the earlier pleadings, Chile notes that the term denial of justice was used in the Claimants\u2019 Supplemental Memorial on the Merits dated 11 September 2002, but it was then used in reference to Decision No. 43 rather than in reference to the Goss machine.115 Although the Claimants\u2019 Ancillary Request of 4 November 2002 related to the Goss machine, Chile argues that the claim asserted was solely for restitution or compensation of the machine\u2019s confiscation.116 At the May 2003 Hearing, the Claimants expressly confirmed that the entirety of the claims in their Request for Arbitration and Ancillary Request were confiscation claims.117 At the Hearing on Annulment, counsel for Chile summarized the argument as follows: \"it [Claimants\u2019 Ancillary Request] does refer to the denial of justice, it does refer to the Goss machine, but it does not refer to the basis on which the Tribunal ruled against Chile, which was the delay [...]. [T]hey never articulated any denial of justice claim under international law as a free-standing claim.\"118\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 133. Footnote omitted.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 146.

In this regard, the Claimants point out the various instances in their pleadings in which they used the term \"denial of justice\" and conclude as follows:121\n\n509. Il r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9veloppements pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que les Demanderesses ont bien, contrairement aux all\u00e9gations du Chili, formul\u00e9 une demande sur le fondement du d\u00e9ni de justice commis par la R\u00e9publique du Chili dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es par les Demanderesses devant les juridictions locales en vue d\u2019obtenir r\u00e9paration pour la confiscation des presses GOSS. La position des Demanderesses n\u2019a pas \u00e9volu\u00e9e depuis leur demande compl\u00e9mentaire du 4 novembre 2002.\n\n510. L\u00e0 encore, les pr\u00e9tentions de la D\u00e9fenderesse sont d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement. Il suffit pour s\u2019en convaincre de relire les \u00e9critures des Demanderesses. Afin de faciliter la t\u00e2che du Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc,* les Demanderesses ont extrait de leurs \u00e9critures et des transcriptions des audiences les passages pertinents.\n\n[...]\n\n514. En substance, les Demanderesses soutenaient que les actes pris par la R\u00e9publique du Chili pour tenter de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal arbitral - en particulier la demande du Chili au Secr\u00e9taire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du CIRDI d\u2019annuler sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019enregistrer la requ\u00eate d\u2019arbitrage d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les Demanderesses, les d\u00e9marches de la R\u00e9publique du Chili aupr\u00e8s du gouvernement espagnol pour parvenir \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation commune des termes de l\u2019API permettant au Chili de soutenir l\u2019incomp\u00e9tence du Tribunal - ainsi que les mesures d\u2019intimidation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Monsieur Pey afin qu\u2019il retire sa demande aupr\u00e8s du CIRDI, \u00e9taient constitutifs d\u2019un d\u00e9ni de justice au sens du droit international public, constituant une violation suppl\u00e9mentaire de la R\u00e9publique du Chili au titre de l\u2019API.\n\n[...]\n\n527. Il r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9veloppements pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que les Demanderesses ont bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes pour d\u00e9ni de justice et pour violation du traitement juste et \u00e9quitable et cela, en ce qui concerne la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043, depuis 2002, date des premiers \u00e9changes qui ont suivi l\u2019invocation par le Chili de cette D\u00e9cision Minist\u00e9rielle au cours de l\u2019audience de mai 2000. Pourtant, la R\u00e9publique du Chili n\u2019a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 consacrer presque 150 pages de son M\u00e9moire en annulation \u00e0 cette question.

Pey sur les presses GOSS.\n\nLe **d\u00e9ni de justice** est en lui-m\u00eame susceptible de recours \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage (ind\u00e9pendamment du sort de la proc\u00e9dure interne ouverte en 1995), car le diff\u00e9rend entre les investisseurs espagnols et l\u2019Etat du Chili porte sur la restitution des presses GOSS, ou sa valeur de remplacement. Pour l\u2019API Chili-Espagne, le fait d\u2019avoir port\u00e9 le diff\u00e9rend devant la juridiction nationale n\u2019est pas incompatible avec le recours \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage du CIRDI lorsqu\u2019on se trouve face \u00e0 une situation de **d\u00e9ni de justice.**\n\nEn d\u2019autres termes, dans les circonstances **de d\u00e9ni de justice consomm\u00e9** le 14 octobre 2002 (d\u00e9cision du Contralor G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Pi\u00e8ce C216), le recours \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage du CIRDI peut trouver son fondement dans le seul API Espagne-Chili.

[Emphasis in original]\n\n183.\n\nIn their Reply of 2003, the Claimants point out that they referred specifically to cases where denial of justice claims were analyzed such as *Azinian v. United Mexican States123* and *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America.124* They also recall that denial of justice was specifically addressed during the January 2007 Hearing.\n\n*Robert Azinian and others v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award dated 1 November 1999.\n\n*Mondev Award.*\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Chile that there is a departure from the right to be heard, which is a fundamental rule of procedure, when a party is not given a full, fair, or comparatively equal opportunity to state its case, present its defense, or produce evidence regarding every claim and issue at every stage of the arbitral proceeding.125 Chile adds that, for a defending party, the right to be heard is essentially the right to rebut; however, a meaningful opportunity to rebut a claim requires knowledge of that claim in the first place.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 226.\n\n185.\n\nWhile the Claimants also agree that parties should have ample opportunity to consider and present written and oral submissions on all the issues raised, they add that the Tribunal does not have an obligation to draw the parties\u2019 attention to an aspect of a legal question that they may have failed to address.126\n\nSee Cl. Rej. Annulment at para. 192 quoting *Schreuer Commentary Art. 52* at para. 317.\n\n186.\n\nIn the Award,127 the Tribunal summarizes fairly the parties\u2019 positions. For the Claimants, it refers to their written submissions of 11 September 2002, 4 November 2002, 23 February 2003, and oral submissions at the January 2007 Hearing. As for the Respondent, the Tribunal notes that Chile has not developed a complete analysis of the concepts of denial of justice or fair and equitable treatment but assumes that it was a deliberate choice.128 The Tribunal mentions only a few remarks made by the Republic\u2019s counsel at the 2003 and 2007 Hearings.129\n\nSee Award at paras. 637-649.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 646.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 603-604 (emphasis onn. 570 and n. 571).\n\n187.\n\nHaving reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions and the relevant paragraphs of the Award, the Committee finds that the Claimants did present to the Tribunal a claim for denial of justice in relation to the Goss machine.130\n\nThe Committee is only addressing liability in this section of its Decision and not damages which it will address later.\n\n188.\n\nThe Committee recognizes that the claim was not particularly well developed and substantiated at any great length by the Claimants but it was definitely raised and it was raised as a claim distinct from the confiscation claims.\n\n189.\n\nSince the denial of justice claim was raised for the first time in the Claimants\u2019 Ancillary Claim of 4 November 2002, the Respondent had the opportunity to reply in its written submissions of 3 February 2003 (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits) and 4 April 2003 (Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits), as well as during the May 2003 Hearing and, to a certain extent, the January 2007 Hearing.\n\n190.\n\nIf Chile did not present any defense, it can only be, in the view of the Committee, because it did not realize that it was a specific claim distinct from the *confiscation* claims. However, its failure to address the Claimants\u2019 denial of justice claim is not because it was not raised by the Claimants.\n\n191.\n\nThe issue is not whether the Tribunal granted both parties an equal opportunity to present their arguments but rather a situation where the Respondent, for whatever reason, did not avail itself of its right to reply and attempt to refute the Claimants\u2019 submissions. In these circumstances, the Respondent cannot blame the Tribunal and argue, as it does, that it never had an opportunity to present its defense.\n\n192.\n\nMaybe the Tribunal could have asked the parties to develop further their arguments on the denial of justice claim but it had no obligation to do so. This is not a situation where the Tribunal stepped out of the legal framework established by the Claimants.131 The Tribunal found liability of Chile on the basis of arguments that had been presented, albeit briefly, by one party.\n\nSee *Kl\u00f6ckner I Decision* at para. 91.\n\n193.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Claimants argued that Chile had waived its right to invoke the right to be heard as a defense with respect to the denial of justice claim.132 Obviously, Chile disagrees with Claimants as it states that it was not until the Award was rendered that it realized that the denial of justice had become one of the two bases for Chile\u2019s liability.133 As just explained, the Committee concluded that the Claimants had advanced the denial of justice claim during the arbitral proceeding. Therefore, it is not a question of a party being deprived of its right or of a right being waived; it is a situation where one party failed to exercise its right.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras 501-504.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 106-109.\n\n194.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee finds no departure at all from the fundamental rule of procedure regarding the right to be heard on this merits issue, let alone a serious departure, and the Respondent\u2019s request is denied.\n\n(ii) *Burden of Proof*\n----------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in connection with this aspect of Article 52(1)(d), on the assumption that the Claimants in fact asserted the relevant denial of justice claim, as the Committee has found, is whether the Claimants actually discharged their burden of proof in respect of this claim since Chile says the Claimants presented no evidence about the duration or handling of the Goss printer proceedings.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n196.\n\nChile submits that, in the circumstances, the Tribunal improperly allocated the burden of proof on the denial of justice claim (as well as the discrimination claim):134\n\n234. [...] [T]he mere unsubstantiated invocation by Claimants of either cause of action could not\u2014without more\u2014have satisfied their burden of proof. Claimants never presented\u2014and therefore now cannot identify\u2014any documentary evidence, legal support, witness testimony, or damages evaluation associated with the purported denial of justice and discrimination \"claims.\" The Committee should not ignore this important corollary of Claimants\u2019 failure to assert the claims that were the basis of the Award.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 234. Footnotes omitted.\n\n197.\n\nChile\u2019s argument is that:135\n\nChile\u2019s argument is that since Claimants did not even attempt to present any evidence on this issue, the only way the Tribunal could have found liability was essentially by relieving Claimants of their burden of proof. Even under the standard articulated by the Tribunal itself, judicial delay does not in and of itself, without more, give rise to a denial of justice under customary international law. Rather, a claimant must prove that the relevant delay was *unreasonable.* In the present case, the Tribunal simply presumed that the seven-year period of duration of the Goss printer proceedings was *ipso facto* unreasonable, without ever analyzing what accounted for the seven year duration, and whether the delay was in fact attributable to improper handling by the Chilean court. In essence then, the Tribunal relieved Claimants of their burden of proof, thereby improperly placing it on the Respondent.\n\nSee Resp. Pre-H Skel. at p. 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n198.\n\nClaimants reply that they have made a proper denial of justice claim and that, as underlined by the Tribunal in the Award, the Respondent decided not to present any arguments on this issue.136 As a result, the Claimants argue that there can be no improper allocation of the burden of proof.137\n\nSee Award at para. 646.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 529.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed carefully the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning leading to its conclusion that the seven-year duration of the Goss printer proceeding was an undue delay and unreasonable138 giving rise to a denial of justice claim. Again, the Respondent may disagree with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion but, by no stretch of the imagination, can it be said that there was an improper allocation of the burden of proof which could be characterized as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It is very clear from the Award that the Tribunal was satisfied with the evidence which the Claimants adduced. The Respondent\u2019s request for annulment on this ground is dismissed.\n\nSee Award at paras. 659-663.\n\n**(2) Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in terms of \"manifest excess of powers\" in respect of Article 52(1)(b) is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by asserting jurisdiction over a purported denial of justice claim for undue delay by the First Civil Court of Santiago (the Goss machine proceedings) that had allegedly not been asserted by the Claimants.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n201.\n\nChile\u2019s position in this regard is summarized as follows:139\n\n428. As discussed above and also in the Memorial, a cause of action for \"denial of justice\" must include arguments and evidence relating to the factors that establish a denial of justice under customary international law and/or the BIT. In order to state such a claim, Claimants would have been required in their Ancillary Request to present evidence and to examine the relevant law and facts supporting allegations that Chilean authorities had unreasonably delayed an outcome in the Goss printer claim, by acts that were so unjust as to violate international law. They would have had to establish the requisite elements to prove a \"denial of justice\" under international law. However, they did not do so in the 2002 Ancillary Request, nor at any other stage of the proceeding. Importantly, Claimants do not challenge in their Counter-Memorial the Republic\u2019s assertion that Claimants failed to plead\u2014and much less to prove\u2014the elements of a denial of justice. It follows from this that a denial of justice claim was never asserted, and that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by issuing a merits ruling that was predicated on a claim that was never presented to it by one of the parties.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 428. Footnotes omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimants reject this request essentially for the same reasons that they invoked above in their response to Chile\u2019s allegation of departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, *i.e.* that that: (1) \" *les* *Demanderesses ont toujours soutenu que les actes du gouvernement chilien \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Monsieur Pey \u00e9taient constitutifs d\u2019un d\u00e9ni de justice,\"*140 and (2) they specifically asserted a denial of justice claim in the 4 November 2002 Ancillary Request and 23 February 2003 Reply on Jurisdiction and Merits. The Claimants thus submit:141\n\n527. Il r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9veloppements pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que les Demanderesses ont bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes pour d\u00e9ni de justice et pour violation du traitement juste et \u00e9quitable et cela, en ce qui concerne la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043, depuis 2002, date des premiers \u00e9changes qui ont suivi l\u2019invocation par le Chili de cette D\u00e9cision Minist\u00e9rielle au cours de l\u2019audience de mai 2000. Pourtant, la R\u00e9publique du Chili n\u2019a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 consacrer presque 150 pages de son M\u00e9moire en annulation \u00e0 cette question. Par la longueur de ses d\u00e9veloppements la D\u00e9fenderesse a vraisemblablement voulu conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 sa demande, une apparence de s\u00e9rieux, qui ne saurait tromper le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc.*\n\n528. Cette d\u00e9monstration permet de rejeter int\u00e9gralement la demande d\u2019annulation de la Sentence fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9tendue violation grave par le Tribunal d\u2019une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de proc\u00e9dure et sur l\u2019exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste du Tribunal.\n\n529. En effet, il n\u2019y a eu de la part du Tribunal aucune violation du droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendue, la R\u00e9publique du Chili ayant choisi d\u2019ignorer les arguments des Demanderesses concernant les violations de l\u2019API. Il ne peut non plus y avoir un renversement de la charge de la preuve.\n\n530. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments s\u2019opposent \u00e9galement \u00e0 la demande de nullit\u00e9 de la Sentence sur le fondement de l\u2019article 52(1)(b) de la Convention CIRDI. En effet, dans son M\u00e9moire en annulation, la R\u00e9publique du Chili pr\u00e9tend fonder l\u2019annulation de la Sentence pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste du Tribunal sur le seul motif que les Demanderesses n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demandes relatives au d\u00e9ni de justice ou \u00e0 un traitement discriminatoire.\n\n[...]\n\n533. D\u00e8s lors, la d\u00e9monstration que ces demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les Demanderesses au cours de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage permet au Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* de rejeter la demande de nullit\u00e9 du Chili sur ce fondement. [... ]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 511.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 527-530; 533. Footnote omitted.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n203.\n\nEssentially for the same reasons which it set out earlier when it concluded that the Tribunal had not violated any fundamental rule of procedure regarding the right to be heard on this issue,142 the Committee rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in finding that the Claimants had indeed asserted their denial of justice claim. This application is denied.\n\nSee *supra* at paras. 184-194.\n\n**(3) Failure to State Reasons**\n--------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe main issues raised by Chile in connection with Article 52(1)(e) and the \"denial of justice\" claim are whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons:\n\n- for its conclusion that the Claimants had asserted the particular \"denial of justice\" claim for which the Tribunal held Chile responsible *(i.e.,* one based on delay in the progress of the Goss printer proceedings in the First Civil Court of Santiago); and\n\n- for basing its finding of the existence of a \"denial of justice\" solely on the length of the local judicial proceeding, without inquiring into any of the other factors or elements that the Tribunal itself had alluded to in the Award as essential for a finding of denial of justice.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n205.\n\nChile submits *inter alia* in support of this ground for annulment:143\n\n494. In the end, and Claimants\u2019 protestations notwithstanding, the only real \"reason\" the Tribunal offered in its Award for its finding of a \"denial of justice\" was that seven years was too long to wait for a final merits decision. However, having itself recognized in the Award that a finding of \"denial of justice\" requires an *\"unreasonable or undue delay,\"* the Tribunal was required to explain not only the existence of a delay, but also how or why that delay (in the context and circumstances of the relevant proceeding) was unreasonable or undue, to such an extent as to constitute a violation of international law. The Award stops at the first step (the delay of seven years), but then leaps to the conclusion that the second step is *ipso facto* satisfied, without exploring the factors that are relevant to that assessment under the applicable jurisprudence and doctrine.\n\n495. Given the foregoing, on this point the Award again sets forth a stated \"reason\" that in fact does not amount to a reason at all within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e); insofar as it fails to articulate the totality of the premises that are necessary to lead to its conclusion. Due to the absence of reasons for its finding of denial of justice, the Award should be annulled. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 494-495. Footnote omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Claimants reject Chile\u2019s contention and submit:144\n\n540. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a respect\u00e9 les exigences de l\u2019article 52(1)(e) de la Convention en ce que ses d\u00e9veloppements sur la violation de l\u2019API pour d\u00e9ni de justice permettant au lecteur de suivre son raisonnement.\n\n541. En outre, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de la R\u00e9publique du Chili, le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas content\u00e9 de dire qu\u2019une proc\u00e9dure de sept ann\u00e9es \u00e9tait extraordinairement longue et \u00e9quivalait *ipso facto* \u00e0 un d\u00e9ni de justice.\n\n542. Tout d\u2019abord, le Tribunal, dans son rappel des faits sur la violation pour d\u00e9ni de justice concernant la restitution de la rotative Goss, renvoie \u00e0 ses d\u00e9veloppements pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents sur la proc\u00e9dure devant la Premi\u00e8re Chambre Civile de Santiago. M\u00eame si le Tribunal arbitral n\u2019indique pas express\u00e9ment \u00e0 quels paragraphes il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il n\u2019est pas difficile de comprendre qu\u2019il renvoie aux paragraphes 459 et suivants de la Sentence, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 ses conclusions \u00e0 propos de la controverse de 2002 relative au *\u00ab diff\u00e9rend r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9ni de justice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les demanderesses \u00bb.*\n\n543. Or, dans cette partie de la Sentence, le Tribunal fait une analyse pr\u00e9cise du d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure devant la Premi\u00e8re Chambre civile de Santiago et des d\u00e9cisions rendues par celle-ci dans l\u2019affaire Pey Casado contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de la D\u00e9fenderesse selon laquelle le Tribunal \u00ab *fail[ed] to analyze in any way the nature of the local proceedings or what happened during the time period that such proceedings were pending \u00bb.*\n\n544. Le Tribunal constate \u00e9galement que les Demanderesses ont \u00ab *tent\u00e9 en vain de faire reconna\u00eetre l'incompatibilit\u00e9 de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 avec cette proc\u00e9dure judiciaire \u00bb.* Il d\u00e9crit alors les diff\u00e9rents recours initi\u00e9s par les Demanderesses devant les juridictions locales \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le Tribunal conclut alors :\n\n545. *Le Tribunal estime que le dernier diff\u00e9rend entre les [p]arties, s\u2019est cristallis\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2002-2003. Avec l\u2019introduction de leur demande compl\u00e9mentaire le 4 novembre 2002, les demanderesses ont pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans cette proc\u00e9dure, reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Etat chilien un d\u00e9ni de justice* et *ainsi formul\u00e9 une r\u00e9clamation.

Si dans ses conclusions des paragraphes 659 et suivants de la Sentence, le Tribunal ne reprend pas express\u00e9ment les rejets syst\u00e9matiques par les juridictions chiliennes des recours des Demanderesses sur l\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 et la proc\u00e9dure devant la Premi\u00e8re Chambre Civile de Santiago, il y fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en indiquant :\n\n*Sur la premi\u00e8re question* [d\u00e9ni de justice], *la r\u00e9ponse ne peut \u00eatre que positive,*  *aux regards des faits \u00e9tablis et d\u00e9j\u00e0 retenus par le Tribunal arbitral,* *l\u2019absence de toute d\u00e9cision par les tribunaux civils chiliens sur les pr\u00e9tentions de M.

[Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 540-548.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants. The Tribunal gave extensive reasons to support its conclusion for grounding a denial of justice claim, which it traversed at length in its Award. The Respondent\u2019s request for annulment on this ground is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**D. Discrimination**\n---------------------\n\n**(1) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *Right to be Heard*\n-----------------------\n\n208.\n\nAs with the alleged \"denial of justice\" claim, the main issue raised by Chile for purposes of this facet of Article 52(1)(d) is whether the Claimants in fact asserted the particular discrimination claim for which the Tribunal found Chile responsible - in this case, under Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT - due to Chile\u2019s execution of Decision 43.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n209.\n\nWith respect to the discrimination claim, Chile maintains that since it was never specifically pleaded by the Claimants it was never afforded the right to defend itself. Chile maintains as follows:145\n\n110. Although Claimants had asserted a claim for discrimination due to Decision 43 under Article 3 (the specific \"discrimination\" provision) and Article 5 (the expropriation provision) of the Chile-Spain BIT\u2014all as part of Claimants\u2019 theory of a \"continuing\" expropriation\u2014the Tribunal in the Award explicitly rejected all of Claimants\u2019 discrimination claims pursuant to Articles 3 and 5. However\u2014and in direct contrast to the Tribunal\u2019s finding in the Decision on Provisional Measures that the execution of Decision 43 could have *no effect* on Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT\u2014the Tribunal found Chile liable under Article 4 (the fair and equitable treatment provision) for discrimination in connection with Decision 43.\n\n111. This finding of discrimination, which the Tribunal stated was based \"aux termes de son appr\u00e9ciation des preuves et de son analyse juridique,\" rested on the fact that Chilean authorities had compensated as the owners of *El Clar\u00edn* the successors of the four registered shareholders of CPP pursuant to an administrative proceeding in which Mr. Pey had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to participate.\n\n112. As Chile explained in its Memorial, the Tribunal\u2019s \"understanding of the evidence\" and \"legal analysis\" was not, as required by the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, based on any claim for discrimination actually asserted by Claimants under the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT. Claimants never asserted\u2014either orally or in writing\u2014any Decision 43-related, Article 4-based discrimination claim of the sort that formed the basis for the Award. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 110-112. Footnotes omitted.\n\n210.\n\nTherefore, Chile acknowledges that the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal a Supplemental Memorial on the Merits in which they claimed post-entry in force BIT violations of Articles 3, 4, and 5 due to Decision No. 43. However, Chile argues that the Claimants did not state a claim alleging that the Republic had discriminated against Mr. Pey Casado in violation of Article 4 of the BIT by actually paying the parties found to be owners of *El Clar\u00edn* in Decision No. 43, although the Tribunal ruled that it had. According to Chile, this is distinct from what the Claimants argued *i.e.,* that Decision No. 43 constituted an unfair and inequitable treatment because Chile had excluded the Claimants from the recovery scheme.146 Chile added at the Hearing on Annulment that the only time the Claimants articulated a discrimination claim under Article 4 of the BIT was in their Supplemental Memorial on the Merits dated 11 September 2002, \"[b]ut it is not even articulated as a discrimination claim, it is articulated as a national treatment claim147\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 129.\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [2] [334:16] (Eng.); [139:28] (Fr.), [364:8] (Spa.)\n\n211.\n\nIn brief, Chile avers that whenever the Claimants referred to Decision No. 43 in subsequent submissions, it was always in the context of the *confiscation* claims.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, submit that they did develop their discrimination claim in their written submissions.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants explain that it was introduced at the very outset of the case and was further developed after Decision No. 43 was issued on 28 April 2000. In particular, they refer to their Supplemental Memorial on the Merits dated 11 September 2002 at pp. 1 and 2, pp. 125-127.148\n\nL\u2019Etat chilien a enfreint l\u2019obligation de garantir un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable aux investisseurs espagnols, sous des conditions non moins favorables que pour ses investisseurs nationaux.

[Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. at paras. 520-523; Tr. Arb. [1] [pp. 87-88] (Fr.).\n\n214.\n\nAt the Hearing on Annulment,149 the Claimants also referred to the description of their claim in the Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 23 February 2003. Finally, they say, that the claim was reiterated at the May 2003 and January 2007 Hearings.\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [212:11-213:13] (Eng.), [88:30-89:10] (Fr.); [229:22-231:3] (Spa.).\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal refers in its Award to the parties\u2019 positions on the discrimination claim.150 In the case of the Claimants, the Tribunal refers to their written submissions of 11 September 2002, 23 February 2003, and to oral submissions at the January 2007 Hearing. As for the Respondent, the Tribunal mentions only a few remarks made by the Republic\u2019s counsel at the 2003 and 2007 Hearings and a page in both the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction of 20 July 1999 and the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 February 2003 concerning Decision No. 43.\n\nSee Award at paras. 637-638; 647-648.\n\n216.\n\nAs explained above in the context of the denial of justice claim, the Committee considers that the Claimants presented a discrimination claim based on Decision No. 43. Even though it is not extensively developed by the Claimants, it cannot be said that no such claim was made. Considering that the discrimination claim was raised in the Claimants\u2019 Supplemental Memorial on the Merits dated 11 September 2002, the Respondent had the opportunity to reply in its written submissions of 3 February 2003 (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits) and 4 April 2003 (Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits) as well as during the May 2003 Hearing and at the January 2007 Hearing.\n\n217.\n\nFor whatever reason, the Respondent elected not to address this claim. As for the claim for denial of justice, Chile cannot blame the Tribunal for not having given it an opportunity to present its arguments. Additionally, as with the denial of justice claim, Chile rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that it waived the right to be heard in defense of the discrimination claim since the Award was the first time Chile became aware of the discrimination claim related to Decision No. 43.151 As concluded, Chile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal denied it the right to be heard on this claim is rejected because Chile had the opportunity to respond. Therefore, the issue does not relate to a right being waived but to a right not being exercised.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at 524-529; Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 132-133.\n\n218.\n\nThe Committee finds that, in these circumstances, there was no denial of the right to be heard and thus no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Respondent\u2019s request for annulment on this ground is accordingly denied.\n\n(ii) *Burden of Proof*\n----------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in this regard is whether, on the assumption that the Claimants in fact asserted their discrimination claim which the Committee has just found was the case, the Claimants discharged their burden of proof.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n220.\n\nChile explains that discrimination in violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment exists where:152\n\n[...] (1) the conduct is attributable to the State; (2) the conduct is harmful to the claimant or his property; (3) the conduct is discriminatory, which involves a comparison of the treatment of the claimant to the treatment of others who are similarly situated; (4) the conduct is \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic;\" and (5) the conduct \"exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice.\" The burden of proof for each of these five elements should have rested squarely on the Claimants, particularly since this purported claim, like the one for denial of justice, was a *merits* claim.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 362. Footnotes omitted.\n\n221.\n\nChile argues that the Claimants did not establish the existence of any of the elements of a discrimination claim, and therefore failed to discharge their burden of proof. Chile submits that since the Tribunal ruled against Chile, it shows that *a fortiori* the Tribunal placed the burden of proof on Chile. In addition, Chile contends that this allocation of the burden of proof affected the outcome of the case, particularly because discrimination, in the end, was the only basis on which damages were awarded.153\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 363-364.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n222.\n\nAs for the denial of justice claim, Claimants reply that they have made a proper discrimination claim and that, as underlined by the Tribunal in the Award, it was Respondent\u2019s decision not to develop its arguments on this question.154 As a result, the Claimants argue that there can be no improper allocation of the burden of proof.155\n\nSee Award at para. 646.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 529.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed carefully the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning leading to its conclusion that the Chilean authorities\u2019 compensation of four persons, whom the Tribunal did not consider the owners of *El Clar\u00edn,* under Decision No. 43, gave rise to a discrimination claim.156 Again, the Respondent may disagree with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion but, by no stretch of the imagination, can it be said that there was an improper allocation of the burden of proof which could be characterized as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It is very clear from the Award that the Tribunal was satisfied with the evidence which the Claimants adduced. The Respondent\u2019s request for annulment on this ground is dismissed.\n\nSee Award at paras. 665-674.\n\n**(2) Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in connection with Article 52(1)(b) is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by improperly asserting jurisdiction over a purported Decision No. 43 related discrimination claim under Article 4 which, the Respondent says, was not asserted by the Claimants.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n225.\n\nChile\u2019s position in this regard is summarized as follows:157\n\n430. As extensively explained above, Claimants never actually asserted a discrimination claim with respect to Decision 43. In the 2002 Supplemental Memorial, Claimants emphasized their claim for a \"continuing expropriation,\" a theory (rejected by the Tribunal) designed to address the requirement for an act of expropriation that occurred after the BIT entered into force. For this purpose, Claimants seized on Decision 43 as an alleged post-treaty culmination of a composite act of confiscation executed by the Chilean government. In other words, they had invoked Decision 43 merely as a new act of expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n431. In this context, Claimants touched upon \"discrimination\" as one of the constituent elements of expropriation. But they never asserted that absent an agreement by the Tribunal with their \"continuing acts\" theory of expropriation, they were also asserting a different, stand-alone claim for discrimination under Article 4 based on the execution of Decision 43. Claimants never asserted, in particular, that Decision 43 constituted an act of discrimination against Mr. Pey in violation of Article 4 of the BIT. As explained above, at no point did Claimants define the legal standards of discrimination, apply those standards to the facts, substantiate those facts, or state a particularized claim for relief for discrimination. In sum, they never asserted a separate cause of action for discrimination under Article 4 of the BIT, based on allegedly differential treatment due to Mr. Pey\u2019s nationality in connection with Decision 43.\n\n432. And yet, it was precisely under that theory that the Tribunal declared Chile liable. Not only that, but the Tribunal\u2019s finding of discrimination became the sole basis for the Tribunal\u2019s award of damages to Mr. Pey. By reaching out to decide a claim that Claimants themselves had never presented, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. The Award therefore must be annulled under Article 52(1)(b).\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 430-432. Footnotes omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n226.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimants contend that they did assert their discrimination claim. Their submissions in this regard mirror those advanced in connection with the denial of justice claim.158\n\nSee *supra* at para. 202.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n227.\n\nAgain, essentially for the same reasons which it set out above,159 the Committee rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in finding that the Claimants had asserted their discrimination claim.\n\nSee *supra* at paras. 215-218.\n\n**(3) Failure to State Reasons**\n--------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn respect of Article 52(1)(e) and the Article 4 discrimination claim, Chile argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons leading to its finding of discrimination based on Decision No. 43 in three instances:\n\n- its conclusion that the Claimants had actually asserted a discrimination claim under Article 4 related to Decision No. 43;\n\n- its determination that the execution of Decision No. 43 had been discriminatory against Mr. Pey Casado considering that Mr. Pey Casado had received an explicit written invitation from the Chilean government to participate in the administrative proceeding that led to Decision No. 43, but that he had voluntarily (and in writing) declined; and\n\n- the contradiction between the earlier Decision of the Tribunal on Provisional Measures of 25 September 2001 - which had concluded that execution of Decision No. 43 could not affect the ICSID proceedings or Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s rights therein - and its finding in the Award that Chile\u2019s execution of Decision No. 43 in fact constituted a violation of the BIT.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n229.\n\nChile\u2019s position is clearly stated in its Reply:160\n\n505. Claimants therefore do not address the Republic\u2019s main argument, which is that the Tribunal provided no explanation whatsoever as to how Mr. Pey possibly could have been compensated through Decision 43, given that he voluntarily excluded himself from the relevant administrative proceedings that were a prerequisite to any such compensation. The references to the possibility of alternate procedures is simply not pertinent here. The Tribunal ruled against Chile not by reference to any alternate procedures, but on the basis that by compensating alleged third parties rather than Mr. Pey through Decision 43, Chile discriminated against Mr. Pey. The necessary implication of this is that the discriminatory act committed by Chile was not declaring *Mr. Pey* to be the rightful beneficiary. But the Tribunal entirely glossed over the logical and necessary component of that conclusion, which is the (incorrect) presumption that Chile could somehow have declared Mr. Pey the beneficiary of Decision 43, notwithstanding his explicit decision, in writing, *not to seek* reparations under that administrative process, and the fact that compensation of non-applicants in fact would have been illegal under Chilean law.\n\n506. As a result, the Award simply provides no information that would enable Chile to apprehend the source of its responsibility for any BIT violation predicated on discrimination, which is a quintessential failure to state reasons. The Tribunal\u2019s failure even to *attempt* to set forth reasons for its finding of discrimination was a clear violation of its obligation to state reasons, which warrants annulment under Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, annulment on this ground is especially compelled by the fact that, in the end, the finding that Decision 43 discriminated against Mr. Pey was the exclusive basis for the Tribunal\u2019s award of monetary damages to Claimants. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 505-506. Footnotes omitted.\n\n230.\n\nChile also refers to what it characterizes as a \"contradiction\":161\n\n508. [...] [T]he contradiction that is not explained in the Award is how the Tribunal could both decline to request suspension of the execution of Decision 43 on the grounds that such execution could not possibly affect the ICSID proceeding, and yet later determine in the ICSID proceeding that the very same act that it had declined to enjoin was the *sole basis* for its finding of discrimination under the BIT, and the sole basis for its award of any damages. [Emphasis in original.]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 508.\n\n231.\n\nIn its Reply, Chile asserts other \"failures\" in the Award:162\n\n514. The Tribunal failed to explain in its Award why it disregarded this critical fact. Instead, it simply announced that although it could not consider any claim for discrimination under Articles 3 or 5, it could do so under Article 4. It did not explain why it was not relevant that Claimants had never raised a discrimination claim under Article 4 and had never alleged discrimination in connection with Decision 43. Indeed, the Award does not explain what Claimant\u2019s discrimination claim consisted of, in what pleading it had been asserted, what supporting evidence had been submitted, or what the relevant request for relief had been. The reason for these failures is, of course, that the claim was never asserted by Claimants at all. This fact further supports the conclusion that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its determination on the issue of discrimination due to Decision 43, and that the Tribunal\u2019s Award is therefore annullable under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 514. Footnote omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimants reject Chile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons.163 With respect to Chile\u2019s argument that their discrimination claim was never actually formulated, the Claimants reiterate their submissions made in connection with their denial of justice claim.164 As to the two other prongs of Chile\u2019s submission, the Claimants answer:165\n\n564. S\u2019agissant du caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043, le raisonnement du Tribunal peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit :\n\n565. Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal indique dans la partie de la Sentence intitul\u00e9e *\u00ab D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 - Indemnisation de personnes non propri\u00e9taires \u00bb \u00ab le 28 avril 2000, le Ministre des biens nationaux adopte la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 selon laquelle les dispositions de la loi n\u00b019,568 sont applicables aux biens confisqu\u00e9s aux Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda. Cependant, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 indemnise des requ\u00e9rants autres que les demanderesses pour la confiscation des biens en question et le Ministre des biens nationaux maintiendra cette d\u00e9cision que les demanderesses contesteront en vain \u00bb.*\n\n566. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le Tribunal rappelle la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Monsieur Pey des actions de CPP S.A. et EPC Lt\u00e9e en indiquant : *\u00abM. Pey Casado a bien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des investissements et \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire des biens meubles ou immeubles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9s par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 militaire chilienne \u00bb.* Sur le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Monsieur Pey, le Tribunal rappelle \u00e9galement qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par un jugement chilien et que les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes, ex\u00e9cutives et administratives (comme judiciaires) \u00e9taient \u00e9galement inform\u00e9es des demandes de Monsieur Pey devant le CIRDI et de sa revendication du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\n567. Troisi\u00e8mement, le Tribunal constate que la D\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a jamais remis en cause le fait que les confiscations intervenues \u00e0 partir de 1973 \u00e9taient illicites et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce titre, l\u2019Etat du Chili reconnaissait qu\u2019il avait un devoir d\u2019indemnisation. N\u00e9anmoins, le Tribunal constate que les Demanderesses n\u2019ont pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de ce traitement. Il indique *\u00ab Malheureusement, cette politique ne s\u2019est pas traduite dans les faits en ce qui concerne les Demanderesses, pour des* *raisons diverses qui, au moins pour partie, n \u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es ou clairement expliqu\u00e9es par les t\u00e9moignages ou autres preuves fournies au Tribunal arbitral \u00bb. Ce* faisant, le Tribunal constatait que la R\u00e9publique du Chili avait fait subir un traitement diff\u00e9rent aux Parties Demanderesses par rapport aux autres investisseurs notamment nationaux.\n\n568. Finalement, apr\u00e8s avoir rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019un traitement discriminatoire est une violation du traitement juste et \u00e9quitable au sens du droit international de protection des investissements, le Tribunal conclut :\n\n*Dans le cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, en accordant des compensations - pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, n \u2019\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s, en m\u00eame temps qu \u2019il paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqu\u00e9s, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a manifestement commis un d\u00e9ni de justice et refus\u00e9 de traiter les demanderesses de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable.*\n\n569. L\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments important de cette conclusion et pass\u00e9 sous silence par la D\u00e9fenderesse dans son M\u00e9moire en annulation, est que le Tribunal a conclu \u00e0 un traitement discriminatoire des Demanderesses sous la double condition d\u2019une compensation \u00e0 des tiers pour la confiscation des biens objet de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage, et le refus de la R\u00e9publique du Chili d\u2019indemniser de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit Monsieur Pey et la Fondation espagnole, en s\u2019opposant par tout moyen \u00e0 leurs revendications et en paralysant, autant que faire se peut, la proc\u00e9dure arbitrale engag\u00e9e.\n\n570. D\u00e8s lors, contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de la R\u00e9publique du Chili, Monsieur Pey et la Fondation espagnole n\u2019avai[en]t pas n\u00e9cessairement besoin de porter leur r\u00e9clamation sur le fondement de la loi 19,568 pour recevoir un traitement discriminatoire. Soulignons \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que contrairement \u00e0 ce que laisse supposer la R\u00e9publique du Chili, la loi 19,568 n\u2019est pas le seul fondement pour obtenir r\u00e9paration des confiscations intervenues au Chili sous le r\u00e9gime militaire de Pinochet. En effet, comme l\u2019avait fait Monsieur Pey pour les presses Goss en octobre 1995, mais aussi comme l\u2019ont fait nombre d\u2019autres victimes du D\u00e9cret n\u00b077 de 1973, il est possible d\u2019obtenir r\u00e9paration devant les cours judiciaires chiliennes sur le fondement du mandat imp\u00e9ratif de la Constitution (article 4 de la Constitution de 1925 aux termes duquel les d\u00e9crets de confiscation \u00e9dict\u00e9s en application dudit D\u00e9cret n\u00b077 sont nuis de nullit\u00e9 *ab initio,* imprescriptibles et *ex officio).* La reconnaissance de cette nullit\u00e9 *ab initio* constitue une jurisprudence constante de la Cour Supr\u00eame chilienne permettant d\u2019obtenir r\u00e9paration non seulement pour la perte subie *(damnum emergens)* mais \u00e9galement pour la perte de profit *(lucrum cessans).*\n\n571. Ainsi, les motifs contenus dans la Sentence permettent sans nul doute de suivre le raisonnement du Tribunal sur ce chef de condamnation. D\u00e8s lors, la Sentence r\u00e9pond aux exigences de l\u2019article 52(1)(e) de la Convention quand bien m\u00eame le tribunal ne r\u00e9pondrait pas de mani\u00e8re exhaustive aux questions soulev\u00e9es par la D\u00e9fenderesse dans son M\u00e9moire en annulation.\n\n572. Finalement, concernant la troisi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie d\u2019arguments, relative \u00e0 une contradiction de motifs entre d\u2019une part la condamnation au titre de la violation d\u2019un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable et, d\u2019autre part, la d\u00e9cision du 25 septembre 2001, celle-ci est contredite par les termes m\u00eames de la d\u00e9cision du 25 septembre 2001 et plus particuli\u00e8rement de ses paragraphes 59 \u00e0 63.\n\n[...]\n\n579. D\u00e8s lors, loin de reconna\u00eetre l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pour la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 de causer un pr\u00e9judice aux Demanderesses, le Tribunal s\u2019appuyait surtout sur le fait que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 ne rendrait pas impossible la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice subi par les Demanderesses. Il n\u2019y a donc dans cette d\u00e9cision de rejet des mesures conservatoires sollicit\u00e9es par les Demanderesses aucune contradiction avec la Sentence condamnant la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur le fondement d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire \u00e0 raison notamment de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043.

Annulment at paras. 449 *et seq.*\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 554-555.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 564-572; 579.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants, in the lengthy citation from their Counter-Memorial reproduced above, have demonstrated, to the entire satisfaction of the Committee, that the Tribunal has stated ample reasons leading to its conclusion that Chile\u2019s Decision No. 43 discriminated against the Claimants and was thus in breach of Article 4 of the BIT. The Respondent\u2019s request for annulment based on this ground therefore fails.\n\n**E. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nChile refers to its invitation to Mr. Pey Casado to participate in the Chilean administrative proceeding that led to Decision No. 43, as well as to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s written waiver to participate in this proceeding. The Claimants, thereafter, requested injunctive relief from the Tribunal alleging that Decision No. 43 required payment to the successors of the registered shareholders of *El Clar\u00edn* for the expropriation of the newspaper and that such payment would, in effect, constitute a new expropriatory act by Chile.\n\n235.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal rejected the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures. It concluded that neither Decision No. 43 itself nor its execution could affect the Claimants\u2019 rights in the ICSID arbitration, since Decision No. 43 involved individuals other than Mr. Pey Casado.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n236.\n\nChile contends that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures amounted to a signal to Chile that it could proceed with the execution of Decision No. 43, confident in the knowledge that doing so would not conflict with the ICSID arbitration or affect it in any way. In the Award, however, submits Chile, the Tribunal held Chile liable for discrimination in violation of Article 4 of the BIT for the act that had been the subject of the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures that had been rejected by the Tribunal: the execution of Decision No. 43. Chile argues that, in doing so, the Tribunal failed to abide by one of the rules it had set for the proceeding, which was most unfair to it. This, submits Chile, was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in violation of Article 52(1)(d).\n\n237.\n\nChile recalls that, in paragraph 65 of its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal stated that \"la D\u00e9cision Minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 43 et son ex\u00e9cution au Chili n\u2019ont pas des cons\u00e9quences telles qu\u2019elles puissent affecter ou la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal Arbitral CIRDI, ou les droits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par les Parties demanderesses...\" Chile then concludes:166\n\n204. [...] In effect, therefore, by this Decision the Tribunal was signalling to Chile that it could go forward with execution of Decision 43, as doing so would not affect the ICSID arbitration. It is for this reason that it is especially unfair that the Award held Chile responsible under the BIT precisely for proceeding with execution of Decision 43. In essence, the Tribunal took away with one hand what it had already given with the other. And this incongruency is rendered even more perverse by the fact that the alleged discrimination relating to Decision 43 was in the end the sole basis for the Tribunal\u2019s grant of damages to Claimants.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 204. Footnote omitted.\n\n238.\n\nChile also contends that the Tribunal failed to state reasons because of the inconsistency between the Tribunal\u2019s condemnation of Chile under the BIT for issuing Decision No. 43 and the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures. Chile summarizes its position as follows:167\n\n510. Thus, the Tribunal reasoned in its Provisional Measures decision that there was no need to stay execution of Decision 43, for such decision *could have no direct effect* on the rights invoked by Claimants. Entirely inconsistently, however, in the Award the Tribunal concluded that Decision 43 *did* have a direct effect on Claimants\u2019 rights, and that indeed such effect was so grave as to violate the Spain-Chile BIT\u2019s fair and equitable treatment clause. The Award thus left Chile at a loss \"to understand the tribunal\u2019s motives,\" for as Professor Schreuer has explained, inconsistent reasons \"are as useful as no reasons at all.\" [Emphasis in Original]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 510. Footnotes omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants reject Chile\u2019s interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures. They write:168\n\n572. Finalement, concernant la troisi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie d\u2019arguments, relative \u00e0 une contradiction de motifs entre d\u2019une part la condamnation au titre de la violation d\u2019un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable et, d\u2019autre part, la d\u00e9cision du 25 septembre 2001, celle-ci est contredite par les termes m\u00eames de la d\u00e9cision du 25 septembre 2001 et plus particuli\u00e8rement de ses paragraphes 59 \u00e0 63.\n\n[...]\n\n579.

Il n\u2019y a donc dans cette d\u00e9cision de rejet des mesures conservatoires sollicit\u00e9es par les Demanderesses aucune contradiction avec la Sentence condamnant la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur le fondement d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire \u00e0 raison notamment de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 572-581. Footnotes omitted.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Committee finds the Claimants\u2019 arguments persuasive; there is no contradiction between the Decision of 25 September 2001 on Provisional Measures and the Award.\n\n241.\n\nIt is important to consider the Decision on Provisional Measures in context. The Decision on Provisional Measures was issued after a request by the Claimants on April 23, 2001 for the suspension of the execution of Decision No. 43 by the Ministry of National Assets of Chile.169 The Claimants alleged that Chile would oppose Decision No. 43 to any ruling by the Tribunal granting damages for the expropriation. The Claimants also argued that Decision No. 43 threatened the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. On this question, the Tribunal decided that Decision No. 43 would not affect the Tribunal\u2019s ability to rule on the question of the share ownership.\n\nSee CN-121.\n\n242.\n\nWhile the Tribunal rejected the Claimants\u2019 request, it did not rule that Decision No. 43 could never prejudice the Claimants. The Tribunal declared that any reparations granted under Decision No. 43 did not directly prejudice the Claimants. The Committee notes paragraph 63 of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures:\n\n63. S\u2019agissant d\u2019une d\u00e9cision visant des indemnisations, elle n\u2019est de toute fa\u00e7on, comme indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, pas opposable aux Parties Demanderesses et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne cause pas (au moins directement) de dommage \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res. En serait-il autrement, ce dommage ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par le Tribunal Arbitral comme irr\u00e9parable d\u00e8s lors que, ainsi que l\u2019a observ\u00e9 avec raison la Partie D\u00e9fenderesse, dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se \u00ab o\u00f9 le Chili serait condamn\u00e9 \u00bb sur le fond (par un Tribunal Arbitral CIRDI s\u2019\u00e9tant reconnu comp\u00e9tent), la cons\u00e9quence pratique \u00e9vidente pour le Chili, principale ou exclusive, ne pourrait \u00eatre que, soit l\u2019obligation de restituer les actions revendiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 leurs propri\u00e9taires l\u00e9gitimes (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une restitution en nature), soit, en cas d\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une *\u00ab restitutio in integrum \u00bb,* l\u2019obligation d\u2019indemniser.\n\n243.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee, this must be read as meaning that it did not create a prejudice that would justify the granting of provisional measures. Clearly, the Tribunal was not ruling on the merits of the case. As it said in paragraph 45 of its Decision on Provisional Measures:\n\n45. L\u2019objection para\u00eet proc\u00e9der d\u2019un certain malentendu sur la nature m\u00eame du syst\u00e8me des mesures conservatoires \u00e9tabli par la Convention de Washington et sur l\u2019objet et le sens des mesures qu\u2019un Tribunal Arbitral du CIRDI peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 recommander. Il n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas question pour le Tribunal Arbitral de pr\u00e9juger en aucune mani\u00e8re de ce que pourrait \u00eatre (s\u2019il se reconnaissait comp\u00e9tent sur le fond) sa d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la substance du diff\u00e9rend. Mais le m\u00e9canisme de l\u2019article 47 de la Convention et de l\u2019article 39 du R\u00e8glement n\u2019appelle nullement le Tribunal Arbitral \u00e0 \u00ab *pr\u00e9juger des droits enti\u00e8rement \u00e9ventuels \u00bb,* ou \u00e0 *\u00ab passer* \u00e0 *l\u2019analyse de mati\u00e8res hors de* sa *comp\u00e9tence \u00bb* ou encore \u00e0 *\u00ab pr\u00e9juger sur les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9ventuels d\u2019un proc\u00e8s qui n \u2019a m\u00eame pas encore commenc\u00e9 en* ce *qui concerne le fond* \u00bb comme le pense la Partie D\u00e9fenderesse.\n\n244.\n\nAs submitted by the Claimants:170\n\n579. D\u00e8s lors, loin de reconna\u00eetre l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pour la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 de causer un pr\u00e9judice aux Demanderesses, le Tribunal s\u2019appuyait surtout sur le fait que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 ne rendrait pas impossible la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice subi par les Demanderesses. Il n\u2019y a donc dans cette d\u00e9cision de rejet des mesures conservatoires sollicit\u00e9es par les Demanderesses aucune contradiction avec la Sentence condamnant la R\u00e9publique du Chili sur le fondement d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire \u00e0 raison notamment de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 579.\n\n245.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants. The Tribunal did not contradict itself. Therefore, it did not treat Chile unfairly and it did not fail to state reasons. The Tribunal respected the rules that it had established for the arbitral proceedings with respect to Decision No. 43 and its reasons are not contradictory. The Respondent\u2019s requests on these grounds under Article 52(1)(d) and (e) therefore fail.\n\n**F. Damages**\n--------------\n\n**(1) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *Right to be Heard*\n-----------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe main issues raised by Chile in connection with this aspect of Article 52(1)(d) are:\n\n- whether the Claimants at any point prior to the Award asserted their damages claim and the methodology used by the Tribunal; and\n\n- if they did not, whether the Tribunal\u2019s introduction of a damage calculation in the Award, without providing an opportunity for Chile to be heard in response, would be consistent with Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n247.\n\nIt is Chile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal never afforded it the opportunity to be heard regarding the calculation of damages, which appeared for the first time in the Award.171 The Claimants, repeats Chile, never alleged breaches of Article 4 of the BIT, and never submitted any separate damage analysis or calculation of damages resulting from the denial of justice and discrimination claims:172\n\n246. The request for damages was framed exclusively in terms of indemnification for rights related to the ownership of the expropriated property \u2014 lost profits, value of assets, and intellectual property rights. However, at no point in the proceedings did the parties address the issue of damages for any alleged \"denial of justice\" or discrimination. Since the Claimants never actually asserted \"denial of justice\" or discrimination claims with respect to the particular alleged State acts upon which the Tribunal ultimately \u2014 and exclusively \u2014 predicated its determination of responsibility by Chile under the BIT, it is not surprising that the Claimants also never purported to set forth a valuation or claim for damages for the relevant BIT violations. With no analysis of damages offered, the Respondent[] had nothing to which to reply. The Tribunal for its part had no basis on which to review any theories or proof of damages.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 137.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 246.\n\n248.\n\nThe only discussion of damages by the parties in the entire proceeding, pleads Chile, related solely to damages resulting from the expropriation claim.173 With respect to the denial of justice claim, while the Claimants requested the costs associated with the addition of a new claim they never articulated a specific request for damages resulting from any \"denial of justice\" claim.174 As a result, the Respondent never had anything to reply to.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 245.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 164; 184-185.\n\n249.\n\nChile notes that the Tribunal itself acknowledged that the submissions on damages made by the parties were limited to the expropriation claim and that there was no debate in respect of damages for denial of justice and discrimination.175\n\n248. Furthermore, the Tribunal expressly conceded in the Award that the Claimants had not presented any evidence of damages on the denial of justice-related or discrimination-related BIT violations (as distinguished from the alleged expropriation-related violations):\n\n**Dans l\u2019exercice de son droit et pouvoir d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des preuves, le Tribunal arbitral ne peut que constater que les demanderesses n\u2019ont pas apport\u00e9 de preuve, ou de preuve convaincante, ni par pi\u00e8ces, ni par t\u00e9moignage, ni par expertise, des importants dommages all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et caus\u00e9s par les faits relevant de la comp\u00e9tence** ***ratione temporis*** **du Tribunal arbitral** **....**\n\n249. Finally, the Tribunal also conceded that, in light of the bases for its conclusion on responsibility, the expropriation-based damages analysis that had been conducted by the parties was irrelevant:\n\nIl y a lieu de relever d\u2019abord que l\u2019argumentation des demanderesses concernant l\u2019\u00e9valuation du dommage (ainsi du reste, par voie de cons\u00e9quence, que la r\u00e9futation esquiss\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse par exemple avec le rapport de l\u2019expert Kaczmarek) se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019expropriation intervenue au Chili dans la p\u00e9riode 1973-1977, notamment en 1975, et confirm\u00e9e par la suite.\n\nL\u2019expropriation survenue avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e de l\u2019examen du Tribunal arbitral, il en r\u00e9sulte que, pour cette raison d\u00e9j\u00e0, les all\u00e9gations, discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par **les demanderesses du fait de l\u2019expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d\u2019une autre cause, de fait et de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un \u2018traitement juste et \u00e9quitable** **.\u2019**\n\n250. Thus, even the Tribunal itself acknowledged that the damages submissions made by the parties were limited solely to the expropriation context, and there was no relevant argumentation on the issue of damages for denial of justice and discrimination. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 248-250.\n\n250.\n\nChile concludes that the Tribunal never consulted the parties and then produced in the Award its own methodology and calculation.176\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 252.\n\n251.\n\nChile recalls that the Tribunal in its Procedural Orders No. 13 and 14 denied it the opportunity of presenting further written submissions including a post-hearing brief following the January 2007 Hearing. At that hearing, the President of the Tribunal asked one question on the damages related to a possible breach of the fair and equitable treatment in relation to Decision No. 43:177\n\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par Me Malinvaud, me semble-t-il, \u00e0 propos de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b0 43, sinon ce matin en tout cas hier, que cette D\u00e9cision 43 constituait une nouvelle violation de la R\u00e8gle du traitement juste \u00e9quitable ou, si vous voulez, un nouvel acte illicite. En admettant cette th\u00e8se, par hypoth\u00e8se ou pour les besoins de la discussion, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire si l\u2019on admet qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une nouvelle violation, le pr\u00e9judice ou le dommage serait-il le m\u00eame ?\n\nSee RA-26c referring to Tr. Jur. [p. 49] (Fr.).\n\n252.\n\nIn the words of the Respondent, the invitation of the Tribunal to answer that question cannot \"possibly be deemed a fair opportunity to understand the claim and certainly not a fair opportunity to respond to it. One does not respond to a Bilateral Investment Treaty claim that attaches serious potential responsibility to a sovereign state orally by thinking about it for one minute in the context of a hypothetical question.\"178 Chile acknowledges that, after the January 2007 Hearing, the Tribunal asked the parties for information on the amount of compensation that had been granted to the beneficiaries of Decision No. 43, including inflation and interest rate calculations. Chile notes, however, that:179\n\n[i]t is important to clarify that the Tribunal had not indicated for what purpose it was requesting this information, and did not provide the parties with any opportunity to provide any comments, or anything other than the raw data it had asked for. Accordingly, such communications cannot be understood as having granted Chile an opportunity to be heard on the issue of damages relating to the purported Article 4 claims.\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [2] [313:22-321:22] *in particular* [321:8-321:16] (Eng.); [131:24-134:33] *in particular* [134:23-134:28] (Fr.); [339:21-348:22] *in particular* [348:7-15] (Spa.).\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 145.\n\n253.\n\nChile maintains that a tribunal lacks authority to adopt a calculation of damages that exceeds the boundaries of the parties\u2019 arguments, without first affording the parties an opportunity to be heard on that issue.180 Chile argues that even if a tribunal has broad discretion to use a damages calculation not presented by either party, it must nevertheless afford the parties the right to address this calculation before adopting it, especially if the question has not been addressed by the parties during the Hearing.181 Chile notes that the Tribunal did not proceed as such:182\n\n251. To compound the Tribunal\u2019s denial of opportunity to be heard, it also decided to forgo the hearing of any independent expert on damages (whose report the parties would have had the right to review and respond to). It did so on the basis that it would have been inexpedient. Specifically, the Tribunal stated in the Award that it was disinclined to name an independent expert to render an assessment on damages, because \"que tout recours \u00e0 une expertise... est en soi g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de nature \u00e0 augmenter, parfois fortement, la dur\u00e9e et les co\u00fbts d\u2019un arbitrage\" and \"que tout recours \u00e0 une expertise... est en soi g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de nature \u00e0 augmenter, parfois fortement, la dur\u00e9e et les co\u00fbts d\u2019un arbitrage....\"\n\n252. Thus, concerned about the already unprecedented delay in issuing its Award, the Tribunal essentially decided to dispense with rigor in the damages assessment phase of the case, so as to be able to issue its Award as soon as possible (even so, it did not issue the award until some 16 months after this final hearing). Faced with the practical problem, however, that the Claimants had not presented any claim for damages and that an independent expert would take too long, the Tribunal resorted to devising a damages methodology and calculations of its own, on which it never once consulted with the parties, and of which the parties became aware for the first time in the Award itself:\n\nEn l\u2019absence de preuves convaincantes apport\u00e9es par les demanderesses et le recours \u00e0 une ou plusieurs expertises devant \u00eatre exclu, le Tribunal arbitral est cependant en mesure de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation du dommage \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments objectifs d\u00e8s lors que, selon les donn\u00e9es incontest\u00e9es r\u00e9sultant du dossier, les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes elles-m\u00eames, \u00e0 la suite de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b0 43, ont fix\u00e9 le montant de la r\u00e9paration due aux personnes ayant, selon elles, droit \u00e0 une indemnisation.\n\n253. In other words, without hearing arguments from either of the parties regarding the issue of damages, the Tribunal decided simply to substitute the *confiscation* valuation of \"El Clar\u00edn\" (as determined in the confiscation-specific context of Decision 43) for a valuation of the damages specifically attributable to the \"denial of justice\" and \"fair and equitable treatment\" violations that the Tribunal alleged Chile had committed. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 136.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 139.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 251-253. Footnotes omitted.\n\n254.\n\nChile then concludes that this denial by the Tribunal of its right to be heard ultimately affected the outcome of the case and must therefore be characterized as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure:183\n\nThe *Pey Casado* Award contained three principal broad conclusions: (1) the Tribunal had jurisdiction; (2) the Republic committed a denial of justice and a discriminatory violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard; and (3) the Republic was responsible to the Claimants for US$10 million worth of damages *resulting from such violations.* [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 255.\n\n255.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that it never waived its right to be heard on the issue of damages concerning the discrimination claim relating to Decision No. 43 because it never had actual or constructive knowledge that a response was required.184\n\n149. [...] The mere fact that parties may have a certain degree of latitude to express views on almost anything in an arbitration, does not mean they are required to opine on every conceivable issue that could come up, lest they risk waiver. In particular, they are not required to address issues that cannot reasonably be discerned to be at play in the arbitration. Here, as demonstrated above, Chile did not become aware of the discrimination claim or of the damages methodology employed by the Tribunal in connection with such claim until the Award was published. Because the right to defend can only be waived if the respondent has actual or constructive notice that a response is required, and because Chile had no such knowledge, it is apparent that Chile did not waive its right to be heard on the issue of damages concerning the alleged discrimination relating to Decision 43.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 149.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants take the position that there was no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the circumstances because the Tribunal\u2019s introduction of the damages calculation in the Award was justified. In the words of the Claimants, \"le quantum du dommage r\u00e9parable au titre du d\u00e9ni de justice et traitement discriminatoire \u00e9tait le m\u00eame que celui r\u00e9sultant de la confiscation, les violations du Chili n\u2019ayant eu pour cons\u00e9quence que de priver les Demanderesses d\u2019obtenir r\u00e9paration pour les confiscations subies[...].\"185\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 613; see also Cl. Rej. Annulment at paras. 208 *et seq.*\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that they did not make requests for specific damages for the breaches of Article 4 since they were included in the compensation claim for the expropriation.186 As for the denial of justice claim, they refer to their Ancillary Request of 4 November 2002, p. 13:\n\nEnfin cette demande n\u2019a pas d\u2019incidence sur le montant total des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats sollicit\u00e9s dans la proc\u00e9dure principale.

Cette position est confirm\u00e9e par le rapport compl\u00e9mentaire du 28 octobre 2002 ci-joint (pi\u00e8ce C225).\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 592.\n\n258.\n\nWith respect to the discrimination claim, they maintain that the damages were included in their expert report of 19 February 2003.187 They also refer to the January 2007 Hearing:188\n\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des Demanderesses est que si cette D\u00e9cision 43 constituait une nouvelle violation du traitement \u00e9quitable, il conviendrait, notamment dans le calcul du dommage, de tenir compte des actes pass\u00e9s du gouvernement et de la R\u00e9publique du Chili, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des actes de 1995 ou des d\u00e9crets de 1977 et 1975 et, d\u00e8s lors, le calcul de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ne serait pas diff\u00e9rent si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019il serait peut \u00eatre augment\u00e9, en ce qui concerne le pr\u00e9judice moral, qui est l\u2019un des chefs de pr\u00e9judice demand\u00e9, puisque le dommage moral qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de celui de M. Pey ou de celui de la Fondation a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9 par cette nouvelle violation de la R\u00e9publique du Chili.\n\nSee Cl. Rej. Annulment at para. 210.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 593 quoting Tr. Jur. [2] [p. 50] (Fr.).\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Tribunal granted Chile the opportunity to be heard before, during, and after the January 2007 Hearing.189\n\n596. [...] [L]es Parties Demanderesses ayant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes au cours de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage sur les fondements de d\u00e9ni de justice et de traitement injuste et in\u00e9quitable, la R\u00e9publique du Chili avait l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter dans ses \u00e9critures les arguments pertinents pour s\u2019opposer non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle violation mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du pr\u00e9judice pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les Demanderesses.190\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 591-604.\n\n*Ibid,* at 596.\n\n260.\n\nThey conclude that tribunals have broad discretion to determine damages, as recognized by *ad hoc* committees, and that even if there was a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure, it would not be a serious one. In this respect, Claimants argue that the Tribunal would not have been in a position to grant a lesser amount of damages, as it awarded the strict minimum equivalent to the amount granted by Chile under Decision No. 43, which was the foundation of the discrimination. Therefore, the Tribunal did not reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.191\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 608-615.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal acknowledged in the Award that:\n\n- Claimants\u2019 damages arguments were strictly limited to their expropriation claims;192\n\n686. Il y a lieu de relever d\u2019abord que l\u2019argumentation des demanderesses concernant l\u2019\u00e9valuation du dommage (ainsi du reste, par voie de cons\u00e9quence, que la r\u00e9futation esquiss\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse par exemple avec le rapport de l\u2019expert Kaczmarek) se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019expropriation intervenue au Chili dans la p\u00e9riode 1973-1977, notamment en 1975, et confirm\u00e9e par la suite.\n\n- The expropriation-based calculation of damages was not relevant to the BIT violations in terms of denial of justice and discrimination forming the basis of the Award;193\n\n688. L\u2019expropriation survenue avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e de l\u2019examen du Tribunal arbitral, il en r\u00e9sulte que, pour cette raison d\u00e9j\u00e0, les all\u00e9gations, discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait de l\u2019expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d\u2019une autre cause, de fait et de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un \u00ab *traitement juste et \u00e9quitable \u00bb.* [Emphasis in original]\n\n- Claimants presented no convincing evidence of damages on the denial of justice or discrimination claims;194 and\n\n- The Tribunal would be able to proceed to the evaluation of the damages based on objective elements, the Chilean authorities having themselves fixed the amount of compensation due to persons entitled to be indemnified under Decision No. 43.195\n\nSee Award at para. 686.\n\n*Ibid,* at 688.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 689.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 692.\n\n262.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that even if, *arguendo,* the Tribunal had such power, it should have allowed each party the right to present its arguments and to contradict those of the other party. Having reviewed the entire record, including the parties\u2019 submissions, the Committee can only conclude that the parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 of the BIT. The Claimants did mention briefly the damages related to the Goss machine and Decision No. 43 but solely in the context of the expropriation claim. It is significant that the relief requested by the Claimants is limited to damages resulting from the expropriation:196\n\n**QU\u2019IL DECLARE** ill\u00e9gitime, contraire au Droit interne chilien et international, nulle et de nul effet *ab initio* la saisie par un acte de force et la confiscation des biens, droits et cr\u00e9dits de CPP S.A. et de EPC Li\u00e9e., la dissolution de CPP S.A. et EPC Li\u00e9e., ainsi que la nouvelle d\u00e9possession intervenue le 28 avril 2000 ;\n\n**-QU\u2019IL CONDAMNE** 1 Etat d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 indemniser en cons\u00e9quence les parties demanderesses eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de leurs dommages et pr\u00e9judices ainsi caus\u00e9s, y compris le *lucrum cessans* \u00e0 partir de la date de l\u2019acte de force - le 11 septembre 1973-jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la Sentence -et ce pour un montant minimum estim\u00e9 provisoirement \u00e0 la date du 11 septembre 2002, sauf erreur ou omission, \u00e0 US$ 397,347,287, auquel s\u2019ajoutent les dommages moraux et non patrimoniaux inflig\u00e9s \u00e0 **M.** Victor Pey Casado selon l\u2019estimation que le Tribunal jugera opportune ; [Emphasis added]\n\nEn d\u00e9finitive,\n\n**Qu\u2019il CONDAMNE** 1 Etat demandeur \u00e0 indemniser les demanderesses \u00e0 hauteur de 515,193,400 US$ (cinq cent quinze millions cent quatre-vingt-treize mille quatre cent dollars des Etats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique) comme sollicit\u00e9 dans le **M\u00e9moire**  pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 17 mars 1999. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee RA-20a, Cl. Rep. Jur. and Merits at p. 254 (referring to Supplemental Memorial on the Merits at p. 152, RA-13a).\n\n263.\n\nThe only time the question of damages for breach of Article 4 of the BIT was raised was at the January 2007 Hearing when the President of the Tribunal asked the parties whether the injury or damages resulting from the hypothetical breach of the fair and equitable treatment provision were the same as or different from those resulting from the expropriation claim.197 However, as the record discloses, the January 2007 Hearing was convened to deal with questions of jurisdiction. It is obvious to the Committee that the Respondent (and the Claimants) had very little time at the hearing to answer the question posed by the President. The Committee agrees with Chile that a party cannot respond to such a question and present its arguments on the consequences of a potential breach of a substantive provision of a Bilateral Investment Treaty \"in one minute\".198\n\nSee *supra* at para. 251.\n\nSee *supra* at para. 252.\n\n264.\n\nThe parties did not have an opportunity to file post-hearing briefs after the January 2007 Hearing as the Tribunal had made it clear in its decision of 13 September 2006 and in its Procedural Order No. 13 of 24 October 2006 that there would not be any reopening of the written phase of the proceedings.\n\n265.\n\nThe Committee notes that, after the January 2007 Hearing, the Tribunal asked for information from the parties in respect of Decision No. 43. However, it is clear to the Committee that none of these requests related to the principles of compensation for the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard:\n\n- on 18 July 2007, the Tribunal asked the parties for \"les documents qui lui permettraient de prendre connaissance des montants pr\u00e9cis concern\u00e9s\" with respect to Decision No. 43.199 The Claimants replied by letter of 19 July 2007 specifying the amounts awarded under Decision No. 43 but without any discussion on legal arguments related to compensation. Respondent replied by letter of 20 July 2007 and indicated that it was reserving its right to comment on the amount of compensation;200\n\n- on 3 October 2007, the Tribunal granted 2 weeks to the Respondent to comment on the Claimants\u2019 letter of 19 July 2007 and also allowed for a further exchange of observations;\n\n- Respondent replied on 18 October 2007 and attached the documents requested concerning the amount of Decision No. 43 and relevant inflation and interest rate calculations. The letter commented on the amount paid under Decision No. 43 and explained the contents of the documents;\n\n- Claimants replied on 29 October 2007 and commented on the data produced by Chile; and\n\n- Chile replied on 9 November 2007 (letter incorrectly dated 18 October 2007) commenting on the issuance of promissory notes as the mode of payment.\n\nSee CN-215.\n\nSee CN-217.\n\n266.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, these post-hearing exchanges do not constitute a fair opportunity to discuss the remedy for breach of Article 4 of the BIT. Even though the Tribunal did use objective elements for the valuation of damages (the data provided and discussed by the parties), at no time did it refer to arguments pleaded by either party. As explained in their Counter-Memorial on Annulment,201 the Claimants, at the January 2007 Hearing, argued that the compensation due was equivalent to the one resulting from the confiscation as Chile\u2019s breach of the BIT had the consequence of preventing the Claimants from obtaining compensation for the confiscation. The Tribunal, however, adopted another standard. It placed the Claimants in the situation in which they would have been but-for the BIT violations and awarded the amount fixed by Decision No. 43.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 613.\n\n267.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal considered and rejected the option of naming an independent expert to assess the damages because of the additional delay and the further costs that such a process could entail.202 However, in the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal could not consider the evidence and reach such a conclusion without having afforded both parties an opportunity to make submissions on the applicable standard of compensation and evaluation of damages for the breach of Article 4 of the BIT. The committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner I* that reopening the proceeding before reaching a decision and allowing the parties to put forward their views on the arbitrators\u2019 new thesis was not just a question of expedience but a requirement as the Tribunal was going beyond the legal framework that the parties had established.203\n\nSee Award at para. 691.\n\nSee *Kl\u00f6ckner I Decision* at para. 91.\n\n268.\n\nFinally, the Committee is satisfied that Chile never waived its right to be heard on this issue of damages. The Committee recalls that the Tribunal had expressly stated before the January 2007 Hearing that it would not reopen the written phase of the proceeding. In the circumstances, Chile cannot be considered to have forfeited its right to object to the Tribunal\u2019s failure to observe the \"*principe du contradictoire\"* when it was prevented by the Tribunal from filing further submissions. In addition, a party can only waive an objection if it has actual or constructive knowledge of a procedural violation. As Professor Schreuer observes,204 some violations of procedural principles may become visible only after the award has become available. Based on the only question posed to the parties at the January 2007 Hearing and the Tribunal\u2019s requests of July and October 2007, Chile could not know until it read the Award that the Tribunal would use Decision No. 43 to evaluate the damages resulting from a breach of the fair and equitable treatment.\n\nSee *Schreuer Commentary Art. 52* at para. 334.\n\n269.\n\nThe Committee considers that this departure from the right to be heard which it has found is serious as the issue on which Chile was denied an opportunity to be heard was substantial and outcome-determinative. Chile was deprived of the right to present its arguments on the standard applicable to the calculation of damages for the breach by Chile of the fair and equitable treatment provision of the BIT. In view of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions, which are part of the *dispositif,* it is evident that this issue was a critical component of the Award and that it materially prejudiced Chile. Therefore, the Committee concludes that it has no discretion not to annul paragraph 4 of the *dispositif* of the Award. Additionally, had Chile been granted the opportunity to be heard on the damages methodology and calculations used by the Tribunal, the Award might have been substantially different. Although, as the Committee decided earlier,205 the applicant is not required to prove that the end result would have been different had the rule been observed, the Committee agrees with Chile that the Tribunal went beyond the standard it established, *i.e.,* placing the Claimants in the position they would have been but for the breaches of the BIT, because in fact it left them far better off \"by granting them over US$ 10 million rather than the US$ 2 million they were asking for in Chile.\"206 Without entering into an analysis of the applicable standard and the damages calculation, there is no doubt that Chile has demonstrated the impact this significant breach may have had on the Award.\n\nSee *supra* at paras. 78 and 80.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 522, *\"Thus, even if Mr. Pey had been granted everything he was asking for in all of the relevant Chilean courts and administrative proceedings, the most he [] would have obtained would have been a suspension of the Decision 43 proceeding, and compensation for the Goss machine. Accordingly, it could be said that ICSID Tribunal did far more than merely \u2018place Claimants in the position they would have been...\u2019 In fact, it left them far better off, by granting them over US$10 million, rather than the US$2 million they were asking for in Chile \"*\n\n270.\n\nIn sum, the Committee concludes that section 4 only of the *dispositif* of the Award must be annulled.\n\n271.\n\nThe Committee will observe before concluding this part of its Decision that its finding does not contradict the conclusions of other ad *hoc* committees that have ruled that tribunals have a wide discretion in determining quantum of damages.207 The Committee notes that decisions in the *Rumeli* and *Azurix* cases analyzed the question of quantum in the light of Article 52(1)(e), *i.e.,* failure to state reasons. The issue in those cases was not whether the parties had had an opportunity to present and argue damages calculations for the breaches invoked. The applicants were challenging the reasoning in the tribunals\u2019 quantification of damages. The Committee in the present section of its Decision has found an annullable error in the process which the Tribunal followed in reaching its conclusion not in the way it calculated the amount of damages.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 606; Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 139-142, *referring* to *Rumeli Decision* and *Azurix v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/1/12, Decision on Annulment dated 1 September 2009 (hereinafter *\"Azurix Decision\").*\n\n(ii) *Burden of Proof*\n----------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe ground raised by Chile in connection with this aspect of Article 52(1)(d) is whether the Claimants satisfied their burden of proving their damages.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n273.\n\nChile lays emphasis on the Tribunal\u2019s acknowledgment that the Claimants had the burden of proving their damages and they had not presented any evidence concerning the valuation of damages for the denial of justice and discrimination claims. Notwithstanding this premise, the Tribunal awarded Claimants damages for violation of the fair and equitable treatment.208\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 365-370.\n\n274.\n\nChile submits the following:209\n\nBecause the Tribunal rendered such determination on damages against the Respondent despite the fact that it admitted both that the Claimants bore the burden of proof regarding damages, and that the Claimants had in fact provided no arguments or evidence at all in that regard with respect to the two claims that constituted the ultimate bases of responsibility, it is evident that the Tribunal disregarded even its own standards on the issue, and improperly reversed the burden of proof.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 368.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent adds that if the burden of proof, had in fact, been placed upon the Claimants, the Award might have been very different. Therefore, concludes Chile, the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.210\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 369.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimants repeat their arguments with respect to the denial of the right to be heard, *i.e.,* that that the Tribunal had discretion with respect to damages and therefore could not have departed from a fundamental rule of procedure,211 that the Claimants satisfied their burden by discussing damages in letters submitted after the January 2007 hearing,212 and that, even if the Tribunal did depart from a fundamental rule of procedure, such departure was not \"serious\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d).213\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 606-607.\n\nSee *Ibid* at paras. 597-605.\n\nSee *Ibid* at paras. 607-617.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n277.\n\nIn light of the Committee\u2019s finding in the previous section of its Decision that the Tribunal denied Chile the right to be heard on the question of the calculation of damages which amounted to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in breach of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee considers that this ground for annulment is in fact subsumed in the denial of the right to be heard or has become moot. However, in order to dispel any doubt regarding Chile\u2019s Application the Committee decides to deny it.\n\n**(2) Failure to State Reasons**\n--------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nChile submits that in awarding damages to the Claimants, the Tribunal failed to state reasons with respect to:\n\n- the methodology and calculations that it used in assessing damages relating specifically to the two Article 4 violations for which it found Chile responsible (denial of justice and discrimination); and\n\n- its determination that it was appropriate, for the purpose of assessing damages, to use the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn* (as quantified in Decision 43), despite the Tribunal\u2019s earlier conclusion in the Award that the expropriatory acts relating to *El Clar\u00edn* were outside the BIT\u2019s temporal scope and therefore outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n279.\n\nChile\u2019s annulment challenge in relation to the damages and based on Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is summarized as follows:214\n\n521. The Tribunal failed to state reasons on several aspects of this conclusion. First, it did not explain why it considered that \"placing the Claimants in the situation in which they would have been\" but-for the BIT violations was the proper standard for determining the amount of damages suffered by Claimants as a result of the alleged \"denial of justice\" and failure to provide \"fair and equitable treatment.\" Nor did it explain why, in order to meet that standard, it was appropriate for it to award Claimants an amount that was based on the *expropriation-based* compensation determined by Decision 43. This is contradictory with the Tribunal\u2019s previous conclusion that Claimants had to be compensated for the alleged BIT claims and *not* for the expropriation. It is also contradictory with the Tribunal\u2019s overall conclusion that Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim was inadmissible; this is so because the Tribunal ended up compensating Claimants\u2014through the back door\u2014for the very expropriation that it had said was outside the *ratione temporis* scope of the BIT.\n\n522. It is important in this context to recall that the only thing that Claimants were demanding before the Chilean courts, in terms of *compensation,* was compensation for the value of the Goss machine (which they claimed to be approximately US$2 million). All of the other judicial and administrative decisions that formed the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s \"fair and equitable\" determination concerned denial of Claimant\u2019s requests that the various Chilean proceedings be suspended pending resolution of the ongoing ICSID arbitration. Thus, even if Mr. Pey had been granted everything he was asking for in all of the relevant Chilean courts and administrative proceedings, the most he [] would have obtained would have been a suspension of the Decision 43 proceeding, and compensation for the Goss machine. Accordingly, it could be said that the ICSID Tribunal did far more than merely \"place Claimants in the position they would have been....\" In fact, it left them far better off, by granting them over US$10 million, rather than the US$2 million they were asking for in Chile.\n\n523. Furthermore, in the end Claimants suffered no harm at all from the Chilean authorities\u2019 failure to suspend the execution of Decision 43. Claimants\u2019 efforts to stop the execution of Decision 43 were intended to prevent a payment for the confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn* to third parties, out of concern that such a payment would render more difficult any later effort by Claimants to collect from Chile on an award by the ICSID Tribunal for the very same confiscation. If such suspension had been granted by the Chilean authorities, it would have allowed the ICSID Tribunal to rule first. But the practical import of this would have been negligible, given the Tribunal\u2019s eventual conclusion that Claimants\u2019 expropriation-based claim was outside the scope of the BIT. It could therefore be said that, had the execution of Decision 43 in fact been suspended, Mr. Pey would have been no better or worse off than he was without the suspension. Thus, the Tribunal failed to explain how Mr. Pey would have received US$10 million but for the alleged BIT violations.\n\n524. In sum, the restitution standard used by the Tribunal made no sense in the context of the particular BIT violations that it found. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to explain why it chose that standard, and its failure to explain why, having chosen that standard, it deemed that the expropriation amount calculated in connection with Decision 43 was the appropriate figure to use to meet the restitution standard, render the Award annullable under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n525. In the end, it could reasonably be speculated that the real motivation for the Tribunal\u2019s decision was its legal inability\u2014due to the *ratione temporis* constraints mentioned above\u2014to compensate Claimants *under the BIT* for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn.* Hence the Tribunal\u2019s strained effort to find some sort of BIT violation by Chile in connection with Decision 43, and the implausibility of its conclusion on that point, particularly given that it would have in fact been illegal for the Chilean authorities to compensate Mr. Pey given his status as a nonparticipant in the relevant administrative proceeding. (On this point it bears noting that even if Mr. Pey had in fact applied for compensation under this administrative process for the confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn,* the result would have been no different, as Chile concluded that the registered shareholders of *El Clar\u00edn\u2014* whose heirs ended up being the beneficiaries of Decision 43\u2014were in fact the genuine owners of *El Clar\u00edn).*\n\n526. The ICSID annulment jurisprudence would support a finding of annulment for the reasons articulated above. As discussed in Chile\u2019s Memorial, the *ad hoc* committees in *Amco I* and *MINE* annulled awards for \"failure to state reasons\" precisely because of the existence of inconsistent or contradictory reasons. Particularly relevant is *MINE,* where the committee annulled precisely on the basis of a failure by the tribunal to state reasons for its damages determination, noting in that regard that \"to the extent that the Tribunal purported to state the reasons for its decisions\" on damages, such reasons were \"inconsistent and in contradiction with its analysis of damages theories\" that had been presented by the parties in the case. The *MINE* committee further stated:\n\nHaving concluded that [the analysis of damages] theories \"Y\" and \"Z\" were unusable because of their speculative character, the Tribunal could not, without contradicting itself, adopt a \"damages theory\" which disregarded the real situation and relied on hypotheses which the Tribunal itself had rejected as a basis for the calculation of damages. As the Committee stated..., the requirement that the Award must state the reasons on which it is based is in particular not satisfied by contradictory reasons.\n\n527. The foregoing analysis by the *MINE* committee is directly applicable in the present case. For that and all of the other reasons articulated above, the *Pey Casado* Tribunal\u2019s failure to state reasons for its handling of the damages aspects of its decision warrant annulment of the Award.

Annulment at paras. 521-527.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimants do not expressly address this ground in their written submissions. They describe the reasoning of the Tribunal with respect to the assessment of damages215 and conclude generally that Chile cannot request the annulment of the Award on the grounds it invoked with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the amount of damages.216\n\nSee Cl.

Annulment at para. 217.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n281.\n\nAs is well established by decisions of numerous ICSID *ad hoc* committees, the \"failure to state reasons\" may consist of contradictory reasons.217 The purpose of this ground for annulment - put differently, the purpose of the requirement to state reasons - is to permit the parties to understand the decisions of ICSID tribunals.\n\nSee *supra* at para. 85.\n\n282.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Chile that the Tribunal\u2019s adoption of the expropriation-based calculation of damages under Decision No. 43 contradicts its determination that this basis of calculation was irrelevant since the Claimants\u2019 claim for expropriation was outside the temporal scope of the BIT.\n\n283.\n\nIn paragraph 688 of the Award, the Tribunal expressly stated that an evaluation of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the expropriation was irrelevant and that all the allegations, discussion and evidence related to such damages could not be considered by the Tribunal *(\"ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues\")* because the expropriation in 1975 had occurred prior to the entry into force of the BIT and was thus outside the temporal scope of the BIT. In the words of the Tribunal:\n\nL\u2019expropriation survenue avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e de l\u2019examen du Tribunal arbitral, il en r\u00e9sulte que, pour cette raison d\u00e9j\u00e0, les all\u00e9gations, discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait de l\u2019expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d\u2019une autre cause, de fait et de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un \u00ab traitement juste et \u00e9quitable \u00bb.\n\n284.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal then proceeded to determine the calculation of the Claimants\u2019 damages on the basis of the evaluation made by the Chilean Ministry of Assets in accordance with Decision No. 43 for the purpose of compensating the persons it considered to be the owners of *El Clar\u00edn* for the expropriation of the newspaper.218 Again, in the words of the Tribunal:\n\nEn l\u2019absence de preuves convaincantes apport\u00e9es par les demanderesses et le recours \u00e0 une ou plusieurs expertises devant \u00eatre exclu, le Tribunal arbitral est cependant en mesure de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation du dommage \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments objectifs d\u00e8s lors que, selon les donn\u00e9es incontest\u00e9es r\u00e9sultant du dossier, les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes elles-m\u00eames, \u00e0 la suite de la D\u00e9cision n\u00b0 43, ont fix\u00e9 le montant de la r\u00e9paration due aux personnes ayant, selon elles, droit \u00e0 une indemnisation.\n\nSee Award at para.692.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s use of the expropriation-based damage calculation is manifestly inconsistent with its decision a few paragraphs earlier that such an expropriation-based damage calculation is irrelevant and that all evidence and submissions relevant to such a calculation could not be considered.\n\n286.\n\nWhile the Committee recognizes that arbitral tribunals are generally allowed a considerable measure of discretion in determining quantum of damages,219 the issue in the present case is not *per se* the quantum of damages determined by the Tribunal. Nor does the problem lie *per se* in the Tribunal\u2019s chosen method of calculating the damages suffered by the Claimants. The issue lies precisely in the reasoning followed by the Tribunal to determine the appropriate method of calculation, which, as demonstrated above, is plainly contradictory.\n\nSee *Wena Decision* at para. 91;*Rumeli Decision* at para. 146; *Azurix Decision* at para. 351.\n\n287.\n\nOn this basis, the Committee finds that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its determination of damages which is a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee therefore grants the Respondent\u2019s request in this regard and annuls section 4 of the *dispositif* of the Award.\n\n**H. The May 2003 Hearing**\n---------------------------\n\n**(1) Right to Be Heard**\n-------------------------\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n288.\n\nChile contends that the Tribunal denied it a \"full and fair\" opportunity to be heard within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) by: (a) denying Chile the opportunity to present its witnesses and experts; (b) but nevertheless permitting Mr. Pey Casado to address factual issues in oral testimony during the May 2003 Hearing; (c) at the same time denying Chile the right to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado in that same hearing; and (d) after having expressly assured Chile at the hearing that it would not treat Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements as factual evidence, referring in its Award to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s testimony at that hearing as if it were factual evidence, and invoking such testimony in the Award as the only evidence on certain key factual findings related to the existence of an \"investment\" and to the issue of whether Mr. Pey Casado was the owner of that investment.220\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at paras. 256-268.\n\n289.\n\nThe main issue raised by Chile in connection with the right to be heard is therefore whether, notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s assurances and the absence of any opportunity by Chile to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado at the May 2003 Hearing, the Tribunal in the Award ultimately assigned probative value to such testimony. This issue also raised the question of the Claimants\u2019 waiver argument in light of the Tribunal\u2019s assurances that Mr. Pey Casado would not be treated as a fact witness.\n\n290.\n\nChile submits that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(1), the parties have an absolute right to present witnesses and experts at a hearing where the parties present their arguments. While Chile acknowledges that a tribunal may have some discretion in this regard, the exercise of this discretion, it says, is limited by the requirement that a tribunal treat the parties equally.221 It further argues that pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 35(1), a party has a right to cross-examine adverse witnesses.222\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 160-162.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 258.\n\n291.\n\nChile\u2019s contention that the Tribunal denied it the right to be heard by not allowing its counsel to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado at the May 2003 Hearing is set forth as follows:223\n\n264. Pursuant to the test articulated in *Wena Hotels,* a departure is serious where a petitioning party demonstrates \"the impact that the issue may have had on the award.\" Here, the Tribunal\u2019s actions may have had a dramatic impact on the Award. The Tribunal permitted Mr. Pey to testify, without being examined by the opposing party, accepted his statements as true, and cited to them as facts in the Award. Indeed, one of the key underpinnings of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that there was an \"investment\" under the BIT was its determination that no formal, written contract or transfer was necessary under Chilean law for the transfer of the CPP shares because of the close relationship between Mr. Pey and Dario Sainte Marie and that Mr. Pey was thus the sole owner of the CPP shares; information that comes directly and uniquely from Mr. Pey\u2019s May 2003 testimony. According to the Award,\n\nIl est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Sainte-Marie, en 1972, pour *\u00ab des raisons strictement personnelles* \u00bb et semble-t-il d\u2019ordre familial(34) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de vendre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A. \u00e0 son ami M. Pey Casado, lequel, depuis bien des ann\u00e9es, 1957-58(35) l\u2019avait assist\u00e9 en tant que collaborateur et conseiller technique, notamment pour le d\u00e9veloppement et l\u2019orientation de l\u2019entreprise et \u00e9tait devenu \u00ab *son collaborateur le plus \u00e9troit,* \u00bb le vendeur souhaitait en effet \u00ab *quitter le pays pour toujours et de fa\u00e7on totale. \u00bb* C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle, **selon M. Pey Casado,** le *\u00ab m\u00e9canisme de transfert de l\u2019entreprise \u00bb* se serait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on rapide et moins formelle qu\u2019il est d\u2019usage sur le plan commercial.\n\n265. The footnotes from this paragraph cite directly to Mr. Pey\u2019s testimony from the May 2003 hearing, in which he stated:\n\nLes raisons pour lesquelles M. Sainte-Marie a eu cette id\u00e9e \u00e9taient des raisons **strictement personnelles** et, \u00e0 mon avis, ce sont des raisons qui doivent faire l\u2019objet du respect quant aux commentaires qu\u2019on pourrait faire.\n\nA ce moment-l\u00e0 j\u2019\u00e9tais son **collaborateur le plus \u00e9troit** **.** Je n\u2019ai pas per\u00e7u pas un sous pendant tous mes travaux de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de collaboration en d\u00e9pit de son instance pour que je sois pay\u00e9, que je l\u2019accepte en tant que professionnel, mais j\u2019ai toujours travaill\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019ami avec lui. Il est devenu \u00e9vident, naturel par cons\u00e9quent que, \u00e9tant la personne qui connaissait le mieux l\u2019entreprise et en m\u00eame temps qui connaissait le mieux de la situation particuli\u00e8re, de la situation personnelle de M. Sainte-Marie, c\u2019\u00e9tait naturellement moi auquel s\u2019est adress\u00e9 en plus que j\u2019\u00e9tais entrepreneur.\n\nDonc il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 moi, disais-je, pour que je lui ach\u00e8te le journal \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il **avait la proposition d\u00e9finitive de quitter le pays pour toujours.**\n\nMon activit\u00e9 \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente et j\u2019ai d\u00fb prendre une d\u00e9cision assez rapidement, en quelques jours. **C\u2019est ainsi que le m\u00e9canisme du transfert de l\u2019entreprise** s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9. Nous ne sommes pas pass\u00e9s par les processus minutieux qui sont utilis\u00e9s sur le plan commercial. En fait, ce qui a compt\u00e9 c\u2019\u00e9tait la bonne foi et la relation d\u2019amiti\u00e9 que nous avions entre nous approfondie tout au long des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n\n266. Had the Tribunal barred Mr. Pey from offering oral testimony over and above his prior written testimony, or had it given Chile the opportunity to cross-examine him on both his written and oral testimony, it might have reached a different conclusion on the issue of whether Mr. Pey was the owner of the CPP and EPC shares. Thus, the Tribunal\u2019s departure from the rule caused it to render an award that might have been \"substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\" As stated above, an applicant for annulment need only demonstrate that it was denied the right to be heard on an issue that was part of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. Because Mr. Pey\u2019s ownership of the CPP and EPC shares was an element of the Tribunal\u2019s decision upholding jurisdiction, the denial of the right to be heard may have caused the Tribunal to render an award \"substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\" Thus, the Tribunal\u2019s actions would constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under the *Wena Hotels* test. [Emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 264-266. Footnotes omitted.\n\n292.\n\nChile adds that, regardless of the Tribunal\u2019s statements about Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s status as a party prior to allowing him to speak at the May 2003 Hearing, in its Award it treated his statements at that hearing as factual evidence on certain key issues. In the circumstances Chile submits, the Tribunal\u2019s denial of any opportunity for Chile to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado on those statements amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Chile further contends that, regardless of whether there was other evidence in the record, the fact that the Tribunal only cited as a source Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements demonstrates that the Tribunal gave them a lot of weight. Chile concludes that it is obvious that the statements had significant, if not determinative, influence on the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on key issues and that fact in itself creates a prejudice to the Respondent under circumstances in which it was assured that Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s testimony would not be given any probative value.224\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [2] [341:23-342:12] (Eng.); [142:33-40] (Fr.); [373:17-374:10] (Spa.).\n\n293.\n\nFinally, Chile denies the Claimants\u2019 contention that it waived any claim for annulment on these grounds since it only discovered the departure from this fundamental rule of procedure after the Award was issued.225\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 164; 176.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimants argue that not all the rules of procedure are fundamental rules. There is no fundamental rule requiring the Tribunal to hear all the witnesses and experts who have submitted statements and reports. Similarly, there is no fundamental rule of procedure guaranteeing a right to cross-examine witnesses at a hearing.226 In the words of the Claimants:227\n\n101. Il r\u00e9sulte de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de contre-interroger un t\u00e9moin, comme le refus du Tribunal arbitral d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moins et/ou experts au cours d\u2019une audience orale, ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une violation d\u2019une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de proc\u00e9dure.\n\n102. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, il ne saurait s\u2019agir d\u2019une violation grave d\u00e8s lors que le tribunal avait \u00e0 sa disposition les attestations \u00e9crites et les rapports d\u2019experts lui permettant de se forger une opinion. D\u00e8s lors, l\u2019absence de t\u00e9moignages oraux n\u2019a pu manifestement conduire le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision substantiellement diff\u00e9rente.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 85-99.\n\n*Ibid.* at paras. 101-102.\n\n295.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants maintain that Mr. Pey Casado was not a fact witness and that Chile in any event waived its right to claim for annulment based on this issue.228 The Claimants further deny Chile\u2019s contention that the presentation (in French, \"l\u2019expos\u00e9\") made by Mr. Pey Casado was treated as evidence by the Tribunal.229\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 105 *et seq.*\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 132 *et seq.*\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Committee considers that the parties\u2019 arguments in respect of this ground raise three questions: (i) is there an obligation for tribunals to hear witnesses and experts; (ii) should there have been an opportunity for Chile to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado; and (iii) how did the Tribunal treat Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements in the Award?\n\n297.\n\nOn the first question, the Committee notes that the ICSID Arbitration Rules foresee the possibility to examine and cross-examine witnesses and experts, but do not require a tribunal to hear all of the parties\u2019 witnesses and experts. Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a) provides that the Tribunal may call upon the parties to produce witnesses and experts. Arbitration Rule 35 describes how witnesses and experts are examined once they have been called to testify. The verb shall in Arbitration Rule 35(1) (\"Witnesses and experts **shall** be examined before the Tribunal by the parties under the control of its President [...]\") cannot be interpreted as requiring all the witnesses and experts having submitted a written statement or report to be examined. Often, at the first procedural meeting, the parties agree on the process which will be adopted if witnesses and experts are asked to testify (e.g., whether each party can call its own witnesses or whether it can only call the other side\u2019s witnesses). In the absence of any agreement, the Tribunal is free to decide that it does not need to hear any or all the witnesses or experts and may rely exclusively on their written statements and reports.\n\n298.\n\nIn the present case, it does not seem that the parties had agreed on a specific process. The Claimants first indicated that they would not present any of their witnesses or experts at the May 2003 Hearing.230 The Respondent made suggestions as to the possibility of examining witnesses or experts.231 Then, the Claimants indicated that Mr. Pey Casado, as one of the claimants, would be present as well as Mr. Alejandro Arr\u00e1ez, their damages expert.232 By letter of 16 April 2003, the Respondent asked that Mr. Pey Casado be present also as a fact witness in order to be cross-examined and stated that it would ask its own damages expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, to be present.233 The Claimants replied by letter of 18 April 2003 proposing 6 witnesses.234 As pointed out by the Claimants in that letter, the contents of the parties\u2019 correspondence on the organization of the hearing were mere proposals that did not constitute an agreement between the parties that the Tribunal would be required to follow:235\n\nLes parties demanderesses tiennent \u00e0 rendre parfaitement explicite le fait qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas donn\u00e9 et ne donnent pas, leur accord \u00e0 quelque proposition que ce soit venant de la part de l\u2019Etat du Chili susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e, directement ou indirectement, comme un accord entre les parties qui limiterait sous aucune forme la libert\u00e9, ou l\u2019initiative *ex officio* du Tribunal arbitral.\n\nSee RA-68c, Claimants\u2019 letter of 13 December 2002 mentioned in Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 April 2003.\n\nSee RA-68c, Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 April 2003.\n\nSee RA-69c, Claimants\u2019 letter of 11 April 2003.\n\nSee RA-70C.\n\nSee RA-71a.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n299.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal indicated by letter of 23 April 2003 that \"\u00e0 ce stade et avant d\u2019entendre les arguments oraux des parties, [le Tribunal arbitral] ne voit pas le besoin d\u2019entendre des t\u00e9moins ou des experts.\" Therefore, the Tribunal made it clear that no witness or expert would be heard, as it was entitled to do.\n\n300.\n\nThe second question relates to the nature of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s intervention at the May 2003 Hearing. Prior to his first intervention, Chile sought clarification from the Tribunal as to the capacity in which he would be speaking. At the May 2003 Hearing, the President of the Tribunal confirmed its understanding that Mr. Pey Casado would not be speaking as a fact witness but as a party representative:236\n\nJ\u2019avais interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement, mais je r\u00e9serve, \u00e9videmment, de consulter mes coll\u00e8gues s\u2019il y avait un probl\u00e8me, mais j\u2019avais cru dire en introduction que nous n\u2019entendions pas de t\u00e9moins.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, le probl\u00e8me de la valeur d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage ne me para\u00eet pas se poser \u00e0 ce stade. Nous entendons d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 comme de l\u2019autre. D\u2019ailleurs toute personne qui fait partie de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation va exposer \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re le point de vue de cette d\u00e9l\u00e9gation.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je crois qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas... mais je comprends votre souci, qui a d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 dans la correspondance, \u00e7a ne nous a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9. En tout cas, le cas de M. Pey est simple. La question pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre que nous n\u2019avons pas entendu pr\u00e9tendait ici t\u00e9moigner. Pour l\u2019instant nous n\u2019entendons pas de t\u00e9moins.\n\nSee RA-24; Tr. Jur. [1] [96:5-23] (Fr.).\n\n301.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it is clear that the Tribunal wanted to hear Mr. Pey Casado as a party representative only. The Committee notes that, in the course of the proceeding, Mr. Pey Casado never submitted any written statement. However the question arises as to whether it would not have been opportune for the Tribunal to treat Mr. Pey Casado as a key fact witness and party representative at the same time. By doing so, the other party would have had a chance to ask him questions.\n\n302.\n\nThis question posed by the Committee relates to the probative weight that the Tribunal eventually accorded to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements. The Committee has found in eight parts of the Award references to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s evidence proffered at the May 2003 Hearing. The quotations are, for the most part, in the sections describing the facts related to either the friendship between Messrs. Pey Casado and Sainte Marie237 or Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s nationality.238 All these facts are supported by exhibits as demonstrated by the Claimants. Certain other references relate to the description of the Claimants\u2019 arguments on the investment.239\n\nSee Award at paras. 61; 63; n. 31 and n. 34.\n\n*lb id.* at paras. 88; 101.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 157; 194; n. 109 andn.146.\n\n303.\n\nOnly two extracts of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements are included in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on the investment: para. 186 (footnote 133) and para. 233 (footnote 190). The first citation relates to the circumstances leading to the Geneva Document and the Estoril Protocol, and whether the latter should be considered as a sale contract (as asserted by the Claimants) or as a contract concluded by Mr. Pey Casado as agent for Mr. Sainte Marie (as asserted by the Respondent). In paragraph 186, the Tribunal notes that the Estoril Protocol sets forth complementary obligations. The reference to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statement is used by the Tribunal to illustrate how the Protocol was drafted. As for paragraph 233 of the Award, it relates to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on whether or not there was an investment but the quotation refers to the wide distribution of the newspaper. Clearly, neither reference is determinative of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion.\n\n304.\n\nChile also argues that Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements were taken into account by the Tribunal in order to reach its conclusion in paragraphs 228-229 that Mr. Pey Casado was the sole owner of the shares of CPP. Chile contends that the Tribunal concluded that there was an investment under the BIT because it determined that no formal, written contract or transfer was necessary under Chilean law for the transfer of the CPP shares due to the close relationship between Mr. Pey Casado and Mr. Dario Sainte Marie. This information came directly and uniquely from Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statement.240 However, the Claimants stressed that the friendship between these two men was established in various testimonies and letters which are part of the file.241 The Committee does not consider that the Tribunal relied exclusively on Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements to make that particular determination. His testimony was just one of several factual and legal elements in the record considered by the Tribunal leading to its decisions regarding Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s ownership of CCP\u2019s share capital.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 295.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 138.\n\n305.\n\nRather, as in the case of the other conclusions reached by the Tribunal, the Committee is convinced that the Tribunal based its determination on a number of documents and factual elements in the file and not only on Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s testimony at the May 2003 Hearing. As explained by the Tribunal itself:242\n\nL\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire est \u00e0 la fois lointaine et marqu\u00e9e par une situation politique et \u00e9conomique tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8re. Aussi l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des faits s\u2019est-il av\u00e9r\u00e9 une t\u00e2che difficile et chaque partie s\u2019est employ\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre une version des faits au moyen de la documentation dont elle pouvait disposer. Apr\u00e8s un examen attentif des arguments et des pi\u00e8ces soumises par les parties, le Tribunal, dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des preuves, est parvenu \u00e0 la conclusion que M. Pey Casado a achet\u00e9 l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A. au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1972. Cette conclusion repose sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments principaux que sont la conclusion de ce que les parties appellent les *\u00abProtocoles d\u2019Estoril \u00bb,* compl\u00e9t\u00e9s par ce qu\u2019elles appellent le \u00ab *Document de Gen\u00e8ve \u00bb,* les versements effectu\u00e9s au profit de M. Dar\u00edo Sainte Marie pour un montant total de 1.28 million USD et la remise \u00e0 M. Pey Casado, en plusieurs paquets, des titres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9s de leurs formulaires de transfert sign\u00e9s en blanc.\n\nSee Award at para. 180.\n\n306.\n\nAs summarized by the Claimants:243\n\n141. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, chaque r\u00e9f\u00e9rence par le Tribunal \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de Monsieur Pey, visait soit \u00e0 replacer les faits dans leur contexte, soit \u00e0 confirmer sa compr\u00e9hension des faits, d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquise de l\u2019analyse des pi\u00e8ces du dossier. [...]\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 141.\n\n307.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s opinion, Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements were not determinative of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion. Therefore, even if it could be considered that Chile was entitled to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado, the departure from that rule of procedure is not serious as the failure to allow his cross-examination does not lead the Committee to conclude that if Chile had been allowed to cross-examine him, the Tribunal\u2019s decision may have been different.\n\n308.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee finds no serious departure from the fundamental rule of procedure regarding the right to hear witnesses and experts and to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado at the May 2003 Hearing and Chile\u2019s challenge is dismissed.\n\n**(2) Unfair / Unequal Treatment of the Parties**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n309.\n\nChile contends that there is unequal treatment when a tribunal grants an opportunity or advantage to one party that is not also afforded to the opposite party and unfair treatment when a tribunal fails to respect the rules that it itself establishes for the proceedings.244\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at paras. 277-278; Resp. Rep. Annulment at para. 182.\n\n310.\n\nChile argues the Tribunal treated the parties unfairly and unequally with respect to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s testimony at the May 2003 Hearing. The main issue raised by Chile in this regard is whether the appearance by Mr. Pey Casado at the hearing as the sole fact witness for either party, combined with the Tribunal\u2019s refusal to allow his cross-examination and the reliance in the Award on his testimony - was inherently prejudicial and unfair to Chile, and thus constituted an unequal treatment of the parties that warrants annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n311.\n\nMore specifically, Chile contends that the Tribunal was unfair as it stated that it would not hear any witnesses or experts at the May 2003 Hearing, but then, ultimately and without notice to the parties, allowed the Claimants\u2019 main witness to speak at length at that hearing. Chile also argues that it is unfair because of the Tribunal\u2019s extensive reliance in the Award on Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements, which the Tribunal accepted as true. Chile submits that this constituted an egregious procedural inequality.245\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at paras. 281; 291; 292.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimants respond that the Tribunal did not act unfairly because (i) Mr. Pey Casado did not speak as a fact witness, (ii) the Tribunal permitted Dr. Cea, the President of the Chilean Constitutional Court, to speak at the January 2007 Hearing without allowing Claimants to cross-examine him; (iii) the Tribunal\u2019s actions do not rise to the requisite level of \"seriousness\" to allow annulment; and (iv) Chile waived its right to annulment by failing to object to the alleged irregularities of the May 2003 Hearing.246\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at paras. 106-111, 114-124, 129-141, and 146-149.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Committee shares Chile\u2019s analysis of what could constitute an unfair and unequal treatment of the parties. However, as explained above in relation to the right to be heard with respect to Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s testimony, the Committee considers that the reliance of the Tribunal on Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s statements was not outcome-determinative. Therefore, even if it can be considered that the Tribunal treated Chile unfairly and unequally by not allowing Chile to cross-examine Mr. Pey Casado at the May 2003 Hearing, the departure from this fundamental rule of procedure cannot be characterized as serious. Chile\u2019s challenge is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**I. The January 2007 Hearing**\n-------------------------------\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n314.\n\nChile argues the Tribunal treated the parties unfairly and unequally when it allowed the introduction of a new merits claim at the 2007 Hearing. The main issue raised by Chile in this regard is whether the Tribunal acted unfairly in violation of Article 52(1)(d) when, having limited the scope of the January 2007 Hearing to purely jurisdictional issues, it then disregarded that rule of procedure by permitting the Claimants to address merits issues at that hearing, and then relying explicitly on that submission for its merits-related determinations in its Award.\n\n315.\n\nChile contends that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by permitting the Claimants not only to discuss merits issues but also to introduce a new merits claim in a purely jurisdictional hearing. This contention is based on Chile\u2019s earlier-described argument that the Claimants\u2019 denial of justice claim was first introduced at the January 2007 Hearing, *i.e.,* that it was not asserted as a substantive treaty claim for a violation of Article 4 until the last day of the January 2007 Hearing. Chile emphasizes that this claim was introduced only in response to a question from Mr. Gaillard that expressly asked: (1) if Claimants were asserting a substantive claim based on a \"denial of justice;\" and (2) if so, whether it would fall \"notamment sur l\u2019article 4\".\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n316.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Claimants disagree that the denial of justice claim was first introduced at the January 2007 Hearing.247 The Claimants concede, however, that the January 2007 Hearing was meant to be dedicated to jurisdictional issues only.248\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 506.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 58.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Committee finds that by allowing the Claimants to bolster this denial of justice claim and by posing questions on that very subject at the January 2007 Hearing, the Tribunal did not treat the parties unfairly or unequally. The Committee notes that, as recognized by the Tribunal itself, both parties exceeded the limited scope of that hearing:249\n\nJ\u2019observerai simplement que les deux parties, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, ont toutes deux quelque peu d\u00e9bord\u00e9 le cadre strict de la question. Mais bien \u00e9videmment, on peut toujours dire que tout est li\u00e9.\n\n[...]\n\nJe crois que nous pouvons dire que le Tribunal \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour veiller au respect du cadre stricte qu\u2019il avait fix\u00e9 et il Ta fait avec une certaine flexibilit\u00e9, dont les deux parties ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9. Il y a eu, plus ou moins in\u00e9vitablement, certains d\u00e9passements du cadre stricte qui non seulement n\u2019ont pas eu de cons\u00e9quences dommageables, mais qui se sont av\u00e9r\u00e9s plut\u00f4t utiles. A cet \u00e9gard, ce qui vient de se passer me para\u00eet le d\u00e9montrer, au m\u00eame titre que ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 hier.\n\nSee RA-26c, referring to Mr. Lalive\u2019s comments Tr. Jur. [2] [pp. 46, 65] (Fr.).\n\n318.\n\nIf Claimants exceeded the boundaries of the Hearing by addressing their denial of justice claims, the Claimants noted that Chile also went beyond the scope of the questions raised by the Tribunal when its representatives developed the subject of the burden of proof.250\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [198:21] (Eng.); [82:24] (Fr.); [215:16] (Spa.) referring to Tr. Jur., CN-213 atpp. 36-44.\n\n319.\n\nThis flexibility allowed by the Tribunal does not constitute in itself an unfair or unequal treatment of the parties. In any event, the fact that the Claimants addressed the denial of justice claim was not prejudicial to Chile. The Committee has already found that the denial of justice claim was not introduced for the first time at the January 2007 Hearing.251 Claimants had presented a claim for denial of justice in relation to the Goss machine and a discrimination claim based on Decision No. 43 in their written pleadings, before that hearing. In its Award, the Tribunal relies principally on the Claimants\u2019 pleadings252 and adds references to the January 2007 Hearing to confirm its understanding of the Claimants\u2019 arguments. Thus, Chile has failed to show the impact that this treatment by the Tribunal had on the Award. The Respondent\u2019s challenge on this ground is dismissed.\n\nSee *supra* at para. 187.\n\nSee Award at paras. 637 - 645; 650-674.\n\n**J. Document Requests**\n------------------------\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n320.\n\nChile argues the Tribunal treated the parties unfairly and unequally when it denied all of the discovery requests made by Chile. The main issue raised by Chile in this regard is whether the Tribunal\u2019s allegedly different treatment of the parties in the discovery process could be justified by reference to an arbitral tribunal\u2019s general \"evidentiary discretion,\" or whether, to the contrary, such treatment was so extreme - and ultimately prejudicial to one of the parties - as to constitute an abuse of any such discretion.\n\n321.\n\nChile contends that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by denying the totality of its discovery requests and later using the lack of evidence on those very issues as a basis for findings against Chile. The Republic\u2019s position is explained as follows:253\n\n305. The *Pey Casado* Tribunal treated the parties unfairly and unequally by: (1) requiring the Respondent to go to great lengths to obtain obscure documents while imposing no document production burden whatsoever upon the Claimants; and (2) denying the Republic\u2019s requests and then using the lack of evidence against it. Specifically, the Tribunal imposed an unequal burden on the parties by requiring the Respondent to produce what ultimately amounted to 2630 documents, while the Claimants were not required to produce any. The Republic was given only a short period of time \u2014 three weeks \u2014 to produce all of the documents. Furthermore, it was required to produce documents from several decades before, during a tumultuous period in Chilean political history, and in response to overbroad requests, when much of the requested information was part of the public record and could have been obtained by other means. Although the Tribunal acknowledged in the Award that \"l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des faits s\u2019est-il av\u00e9r\u00e9 une t\u00e2che difficile et chaque partie s\u2019est employ\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre une version des faits au moyen de la documentation dont elle pouvait disposer,\" because the Claimants had no duty to produce documents, only the Respondent, in fact, was charged with this \"difficult task.\"\n\n[...]\n\n311. [...] The Tribunal\u2019s actions with respect to the Republic\u2019s evidentiary requests create a substantial departure from the principle of fairness because the departure clearly deprived Chile of the benefit that the rule was intended to provide, which in the context of a discovery request, is to give a party the opportunity to substantiate its claim or its defense with relevant documentation in the possession of the other party. Had the Republic succeeded in obtaining evidence that the funds in question did not belong to Mr. Pey Casado, this evidence could have served to prove that Mr. Pey was a mere intermediary rather than the owner of the CPP and EPC shares. As an intermediary rather than owner, Mr. Pey would not have been permitted to recover under the BIT, and the claims would have been dismissed. Therefore, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by first denying the entirety of the Respondent\u2019s evidentiary requests and later faulting the Republic for the lack of the very evidence the Republic had sought through discovery.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. at paras. 305, 311. Footnotes omitted.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n322.\n\nIn response, the Claimants submit that, \"[s]\u2019agissant de la production de documents, l\u00e0 encore, le Tribunal arbitral jouit d\u2019une grande discr\u00e9tion pour les ordonner ou les rejeter\".254 The Claimants consider that the Tribunal treated the parties fairly and equally:255\n\n103. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, l\u2019obligation de traitement juste et \u00e9quitable d\u2019une partie pendant la proc\u00e9dure, requiert du Tribunal qu\u2019il traite les Parties de mani\u00e8re impartiale et \u00e9galitaire. En d\u2019autres termes, selon ce principe, un Tribunal arbitral ne doit pas favoriser une partie au d\u00e9triment d\u2019une autre dans ses d\u00e9cisions proc\u00e9durales ou lui accorder un avantage proc\u00e9dural. Cela ne signifie pas pour autant que le Tribunal doive rendre des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 tout point de vue \u00e9gal concernant les diff\u00e9rentes demandes des Parties. En particulier, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019ordonner la production de documents sollicit\u00e9s par une partie d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019il aurait acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019autre partie. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, tel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas.\n\n104. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, ainsi qu\u2019il le sera d\u00e9montr\u00e9 ci-dessous, le Tribunal a permis aux deux Parties de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments sur l\u2019ensemble du dossier et a toujours accord\u00e9 une grande attention au respect du principe d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les Parties.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 153.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 103-104.\n\n323.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that they were entitled to greater access to documents than Chile because all the relevant documents were in Chile\u2019s possession.256 In the words of the Claimants:257\n\n169. Il r\u00e9sulte de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que, contrairement aux all\u00e9gations du Chili, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas agi de mani\u00e8re in\u00e9quitable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la R\u00e9publique du Chili. Ses d\u00e9cisions concernant la communication de documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 guid\u00e9es instamment par l\u2019attitude de la D\u00e9fenderesse qui, tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure, n\u2019a eu de cesse d\u2019emp\u00eacher les Demanderesses d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux preuves qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait \u00e0 la suite de leur confiscation illicite par les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 162-168.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 169.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Committee finds the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision in *Azurix Corp v. Argentine Republic* apposite in the present case and adopts it:\n\n210. Because the power is discretionary, a decision by a tribunal not to accede to a party\u2019s request to exercise that power can never, in and of itself, be a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. A decision by a tribunal whether or not to exercise a discretionary power that it has under a rule of procedure is an *exercise* of that rule of procedure, and not a *departure from* that rule of procedure. It is only where the exercise of that discretion, in all of the circumstances of the case, amounts to a serious departure from another rule of procedure of a fundamental nature that there will be grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n233. [...] the Committee observes that the fact that a request by one party is allowed while a request by another party is denied does not mean that there has been an inequality in the treatment of the parties. Each request by each party must be considered and determined by the tribunal on its own individual merits. It is only where it can be shown that a tribunal has applied inconsistent standards in the way that it has treated the requests of the different parties that there can be said to be inequality of treatment. [Emphasis in original]\n\n325.\n\nWhile it is true that the Respondent had to produce a large number of documents258 as opposed to the Claimants who were not asked to produce any, this inequality in numbers does not imply an unequal treatment by the Tribunal. In order to make a determination, one has to look at the way the Tribunal treated the requests.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 305 (2630 documents).\n\n326.\n\nFurther to the 20 May 2002 request from the Claimants,259 the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order on 22 July 2002 ordering the Republic of Chile to produce the documents requested.260 The Tribunal based its decision on \"la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 manifeste pour le Tribunal Arbitral de disposer du maximum d\u2019informations relatives au litige\". The documents to be produced also included the ones which had been seized by the Chilean Authorities after 11 September 1973.\n\nSee RA-62a.\n\nSee RA-63a.\n\n327.\n\nChile filed its first document production request on 3 October 2002.261 The request was supplemented on 30 October 2002262 further to the Claimants\u2019 observations of 11 October 2002.263 Chile\u2019s request contained a list of 17 items corresponding to 21 documents to be produced. The requested documents notably concerned the questions of the nationality of Mr. Pey Casado as well as his standing as an investor.264 By letter of 11 November 2002, the Tribunal rejected Chile\u2019s request:265\n\n[Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal] m\u2019a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 de vous indiquer que la requ\u00eate concernant la production de documents n\u2019est pas approuv\u00e9e. Une d\u00e9cision motiv\u00e9e concernant ces deux questions vous sera notifi\u00e9e dans la semaine du 18 novembre 2002.\n\nSee RA-65a.\n\nSee RA-66a.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 164.\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at para. 301; Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 194, 196.\n\nSee RA-67a.\n\n328.\n\nThe decision of the Tribunal on this evidentiary request was issued in the form of Procedural Order No. 10 dated 3 December 2002.266 The Tribunal indicated that it could not at that stage of the procedure decide on the arguments between the parties regarding document production:\n\nConstatant qu\u2019il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal arbitral, en tous les cas en l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de la proc\u00e9dure, de statuer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de ces requ\u00eates, sur la pertinence de tel document particulier, les conditions de sa production ou les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019absence de cette derni\u00e8re [...]\n\nSee CN-149.\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal then reminded the parties of the general principles applicable in the context of document production requests:\n\n[...] tout document [...] qui est prima facie en relation avec l\u2019objet du litige peut et doit \u00eatre produit, sur requ\u00eate de l\u2019autre Partie ou du Tribunal, s\u2019il est en la possession de la Partie sollicit\u00e9e ou accessible par elle ; [...]\n\nIl appartient dans chaque cas au Tribunal Arbitral d\u2019appr\u00e9cier, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des explications fournies par les Parties, les circonstances d\u2019un \u00e9ventuel d\u00e9faut de production, et d\u2019en tirer le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant les cons\u00e9quences qui en d\u00e9coulent [...]\n\n330.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that in those cases where the property of the requesting party has been seized and there is limited or no access to the documents that can support the request, it is reasonable for a tribunal to request more efforts and more documents from the Respondent State. Notwithstanding this approach, a tribunal should adopt similar standards *vis-\u00e0-vis* each party when making its determinations. In this case, the Committee notes that the Tribunal gave some justifications as to why it was granting all of the Claimants\u2019 discovery requests. However, Respondent\u2019s request was denied without any explanation or mention of the relevance or materiality of the requested documents. Procedural Order No. 10 contains in fact language which contradicts the outright denial of Chile\u2019s request (by letter of 11 November 2002) as the Tribunal indicated that it could not decide on the merits of parties\u2019 requests.\n\n331.\n\nHowever, the Committee considers that even if there may be some justification for finding that there might have been an inequality in the treatment of the parties in this instance, the Committee is not convinced that had the Tribunal proceeded differently it could have reached a result substantially different. First, even if the Tribunal had motivated its decision to deny Chile\u2019s request, there is no reason to conclude that it would have granted it. Second, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal used the absence of evidence on the issues dealt with in Chile\u2019s denied evidentiary requests to conclude that Mr. Pey Casado was the owner of the CPP shares. As stated by the Claimants in their Rejoinder:267\n\n52. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments, \u00e0 savoir : la preuve de la signature d\u2019un accord (les Protocoles d\u2019Estoril et l\u2019Accord compl\u00e9mentaire de Gen\u00e8ve), et le paiement du prix, mais aussi par la d\u00e9tention des titres par Monsieur Pey ainsi qu\u2019en raison de la reconnaissance par les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes de la qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 Monsieur Pey.\n\nSee Cl. Rej. Annulment at para. 52. Footnotes omitted.\n\n332.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Respondent\u2019s request based on this ground is denied.\n\n**K. Bias by Arbitrator Bedjaoui**\n----------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThe main issue is this regard is whether any bias by Mr. Bedjaoui against Chile ultimately affected the outcome of the case and thus amounted to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in violation of Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n334.\n\nIn advancing its bias contention, Chile refers to the resignation of Mr. Rezek as President of the Tribunal and, in particular, Mr. Rezek\u2019s resignation letter dated 13 March 2001268 which states in part as follows:\n\nJe regrette profond\u00e9ment que ce manque de confiance de la partie demanderesse dans l\u2019arbitre pr\u00e9sident ne soit exprim\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure, \u00e0 savoir quelques jours apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9union r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00e0 huis clos entre les arbitres pour discuter de leurs opinions finales.\n\nSee RA-54a.\n\n335.\n\nIn this regard, Chile surmises:269\n\n388. This statement strongly suggests: (1) that a decision had already been taken by the Tribunal; (2) that the Claimants had been apprised of this decision, likely by means of a breach of confidentiality by the Claimants\u2019 party-appointed arbitrator; and (3) that the Claimants\u2019 request for Mr. Rezek\u2019s resignation was an attempt to thwart a decision in favor of the Republic.\n\n389. The likelihood that the Claimants were acting based on confidential information concerning the inner workings of the Tribunal is heightened by the following revelation by Arbitrator Leoro Franco, made during the disqualification proceedings in 2005 :\n\n[O]n peut d\u00e9duire de ses notes [de M. Garc\u00e9s], **sait m\u00e9ticuleusement ce qui se passe \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Tribunal, ce que le Tribunal doit faire ou non \u00e0 une prochaine** **session, ce que le Secr\u00e9tariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du CIRDI doit faire, d\u00e9montrant ainsi autant de connaissances que celles que peut avoir un arbitre participant de la proc\u00e9dure.**\n\n390. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the Claimants\u2019 chosen arbitrator, Mr. Bedjaoui, had systematically been breaching his duty of confidentiality, including by informing the Claimants of the result of the 2001 deliberations, and of an imminent decision adverse to the Claimants, which immediately prompted their implausible and unfounded challenge.\n\n391. The *Wena Hotels* test requires that an alleged departure from a fundamental rule of procedure must have potentially \"caused the tribunal to render an award \u2018substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed,\"\u2019 and provides that \"the petitioning party must show the impact that the issue may have had on the award.\" Mr. Bedjaoui\u2019s bias in favor of the Claimants and his evident breach of confidentiality led to the Claimants\u2019 challenge to resignation of Mr. Rezek, which in turn evidently derailed a jurisdictional ruling in favor of Chile. Mr. Bedjaoui\u2019s bias thus clearly affected the outcome of the case in a very concrete and discernible way. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Resp. Mem. Annulment at paras. 388-391.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n336.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 position that the Committee cannot declare \"la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence sur une simple apparence de partialit\u00e9\"270 and that, furthermore, \"l'accusation de partialit\u00e9 du Tribunal ou d\u2019un de ses membres ne doit pas \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur de simples sp\u00e9culations.\"271 The Claimants add:272\n\n181. De plus, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la r\u00e9cusation de l\u2019arbitre sur lequel porte toutes les accusations de l\u2019Etat chilien, Monsieur le Juge Bedjaoui, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le Centre. Or, l\u2019annulation sur le fondement de d\u00e9faut d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal ne peut \u00eatre une sanction appropri\u00e9e que si la cause de r\u00e9cusation est apparue apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la Sentence ou lorsque la r\u00e9cusation pour pr\u00e9tendue partialit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par le Centre d\u2019arbitrage.\n\n182. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, seule la demande de r\u00e9cusation de Monsieur le juge Bedjaoui \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une pr\u00e9tendue partialit\u00e9. D\u00e8s lors, le rejet de la r\u00e9cusation du Professeur Lalive ne peut fonder l\u2019annulation de la Sentence. Or, apr\u00e8s f\u00e9vrier 2006, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s l\u2019acceptation de la r\u00e9cusation de Monsieur Bedjaoui, la R\u00e9publique du Chili n\u2019a pas \u00e9mis de r\u00e9serve sur le fait que le Tribunal nouvellement constitu\u00e9 allait continuer sa mission. Elle n\u2019a jamais indiqu\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9tendue partialit\u00e9 de Monsieur Bedjaoui avait conduit le Tribunal arbitral \u00e0 rouvrir les d\u00e9bats en 2001, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9mission du Pr\u00e9sident Rezek. Pourtant, au vu de l\u2019argument aujourd\u2019hui soutenu, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait de formuler une telle objection, ou en tout \u00e9tat de cause, de formuler des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, si elle pouvait les fonder. La R\u00e9publique du Chili ne peut l\u00e9gitimement attendre de constater que la Sentence lui est d\u00e9favorable pour soulever cet argument pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant un Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc.*\n\n183. Pour cette raison, la demande de la R\u00e9publique du Chili doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 175.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 180.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 181-183.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants. The Committee will not annul an Award on the basis of arguments based on pure speculation. In any event, the Committee has been presented with no evidence at all that Mr. Bedjaoui\u2019s behaviour affected in any way the outcome of this case. The Respondent\u2019s request is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**L. The Tribunal\u2019s** ***Ex Aequo et Bono*** **Decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe main issue in this regard is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in violation of Article 52(1)(b), by issuing a ruling that, in the submission of Chile, is in effect an *ex aequo et bono* decision, thereby failing to abide by (and therefore apply) ICSID Convention Article 42(3), which forbids tribunals from ruling *ex aequo et bono* without the parties\u2019 consent.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n339.\n\nChile\u2019s position in this regard is stated as follows:273\n\n433. Claimants mischaracterize the Republic\u2019s request for annulment based on the Tribunal\u2019s adoption of a decision *ex aequo et bono.* Contrary to what Claimants contend, this request is not predicated on the fact that the Republic did not have the opportunity to be heard on the denial of justice and discrimination issues (although the latter procedural flaw is in fact invoked\u2014separately\u2014as a ground for annulment under article 52(1)(d), as explained above). Rather, as explained in the Memorial, the Republic\u2019s *ex aequo et bono* argument is based on the fact that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by reaching a decision that is so illogical, and so strained, that it can only plausibly be explained by a desire by the Tribunal to achieve a Solomonic solution designed to satisfy both parties.\n\n434. The unlikely and often wholly unsupported determinations that the Tribunal was required to make, on so many different issues, to reach its final decision, combined with its contorted justifications for many of its conclusions, powerfully suggest an effort by the Tribunal to reverse-engineer its ruling, using a preordained result as its starting point. However, it was not open to the Tribunal to make an equity-based decision without the parties\u2019 approval. In the present case, the record strongly indicates that this is precisely what the Tribunal did. This constitutes a manifest excess of powers that renders the Award annullable under Article 52(1)(b).\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 433-434.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Claimants refer to Chile\u2019s *ex aequo et bono* contention as follows:274\n\n485. Partant du principe que les Parties n\u2019ont jamais d\u00e9battu de l\u2019existence d\u2019un d\u00e9ni de justice ou d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire de la part du Chili, la D\u00e9fenderesse all\u00e8gue que le Tribunal arbitral a rendu une d\u00e9cision *ex aequo et bono,* sans l\u2019accord pr\u00e9alable des Parties, ce qui constitue un exc\u00e8s manifeste de pouvoir de la part du Tribunal rendant la Sentence annulable en application de l'article 52(1)(b) de la Convention CIRDI. La R\u00e9publique du Chili tente d'expliquer une violation aussi flagrante des r\u00e8gles du CIRDI par un Tribunal arbitral aussi exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 que celui qui a rendu la Sentence par le fait que celui-ci ne pouvait s\u00e9rieusement rejeter les demandes des Demanderesses apr\u00e8s dix ann\u00e9es de proc\u00e9dure.\n\nSee Cl. C-Mem. Annulment at para. 485.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThis ground for annulment must fail. There is not a scintilla of evidence that allows Chile, confronted with an Award of 233 pages (in the French version) and a detailed analysis by the Tribunal of the many complex factual and legal issues of which it was seized by the parties, to argue that the Tribunal issued an *ex aequo et bono* decision. The Award is not an *ex aequo et bono* decision and the Respondent\u2019s request is dismissed.\n\n**M. The Claimants\u2019 Annulment Challenge**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants\u2019 annulment challenge, the Committee must first determine whether the Claimants\u2019 request for annulment is time-barred, having been raised for the first time in their Counter-Memorial on Annulment. If the Committee finds that the request is not time-barred, it would then be required to determine, first, whether the claim is not an impermissible attempt to appeal on the merits a twice-rejected substantive argument; and only then, whether the Tribunal in fact failed to apply the proper law on the nullity *ab initio* issue.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Positions**\n----------------------\n\nClaimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Committee recalls that the Claimants request that point 8 only of the *dispositif* of the Award be annulled on the following grounds:275\n\n28. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n\ni. le Chili soutient que la Sentence doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, en ce inclus le 8eme point du Dispositif. Les Demanderesses sollicitent du Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* qu\u2019il rejette la demande d\u2019annulation de la Sentence sauf sur le 8eme point du Dispositif.\n\nii. La demande d\u2019annulation du Chili se fonde notamment sur exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste, pour d\u00e9faut d\u2019application de la norme applicable. C\u2019est \u00e9galement sur ce fondement que les Demanderesses consid\u00e8rent que le 8eme point du Dispositif doit partiellement \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\n\niii. La R\u00e9publique du Chili soutient que le Tribunal arbitral a manifestement exc\u00e9d\u00e9 son pouvoir en se reconnaissant comp\u00e9tent alors que l\u2019investissement avait pr\u00e9tendument disparu sur la base de la pr\u00e9misse suivante : \u00ab *that such investment had been completely and definitively extinguished long before the BIT\u2019s entry into force* \u00bb. Le Chili fonde son affirmation sur le fait que le Tribunal arbitral a indiqu\u00e9 que le D\u00e9cret n\u00b0165 \u00e9tait toujours en vigueur dans l\u2019ordre juridique chilien et que, d\u00e8s lors, l\u2019expropriation \u00e9tait un acte instantan\u00e9. Les Demanderesses consid\u00e8rent que cette contradiction existe r\u00e9ellement dans la Sentence.\n\niv. Mais la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cette contradiction ne se trouve pas l\u00e0 o\u00f9 le Chili la situe mais ailleurs, dans **l\u2019ignorance absolue** de la norme interne imp\u00e9rativement et directement applicable, *ex officio,* au diff\u00e9rend n\u00e9 en 1995. \u00e0 savoir l\u2019article 7 de la Constitution du Chili. Les demanderesses consid\u00e8rent que le Tribunal arbitral a effectivement commis un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste en ignorant l\u2019article 7 de la Constitution.\n\nv. Cette contradiction n\u2019affecte en aucune mani\u00e8re, en cons\u00e9quence, les points 1 \u00e0 7 du Dispositif de la Sentence -portant sur les diff\u00e9rends n\u00e9s en 2000 et 2002 - mais le seul diff\u00e9rend n\u00e9 en 1995 et la partie corr\u00e9lative du seul 8eme point du Dispositif.\n\n29. Au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 et du mal fond\u00e9 de l\u2019argument du Chili tendant \u00e0 affirmer que l\u2019investissement a disparu, les demanderesses admettent que le Tribunal a commis un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste en ayant omis d\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re absolue l\u2019article 7 de la Constitution au diff\u00e9rend n\u00e9 en 1995. [Emphasis in original]\n\nSee Cl. Pre-H Skel. at paras. 28-29.\n\nChile\u2019s Position\n----------------\n\n344.\n\nChile summarizes its response as follows:276\n\n534. By submitting their annulment claim more than two years after publication of the 8 May 2008 Award, Claimants have utterly failed to comply with the 120-day time limit set forth in Article 52(2). (It bears noting in this regard that Claimants also did not attempt to file any annulment request within 120 days of the 18 November 2009 Decision on Revision). For these reasons, Claimants have waived any and all rights to present an annulment claim in this arbitration, and the Committee must therefore summarily reject their purported counterclaim for annulment.\n\n[...]\n\n543. In sum, in its Decision on Revision, the Tribunal rejected for the second time Claimants\u2019 arguments about the nullity *ab initio* of the 1975 decree, and in particular the relevance of that issue for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Notably, and likely due to the disingenuousness of the Revision petition and the rather transparent intent by Claimants to reargue the merits of the nullity *ab initio* issue, the Tribunal imposed on Claimants responsibility for covering the totality of the costs of the Revision proceeding.\n\n544. Given this background, it is nothing short of remarkable\u2014and indeed, rather abusive\u2014 that Claimants now seek yet another bite at the apple, this time disguising their appeal as an annulment claim. The Committee should not permit Claimants to do this yet again.\n\n[...]\n\n545. Even if Claimants\u2019 counterclaim for annulment were not time-barred, and even if it did not constitute merely a brazen attempt to appeal an already twice-rejected substantive argument, it still would fail, because it does not even remotely raise a valid ground for annulment. In particular, the Tribunal did not fail to apply Chilean law to the relevant issue.\n\nSee Resp. Rep. Annulment at paras. 534; 543-545.\n\n**Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n345.\n\nArticle 52(2) of the ICSID Convention is very clear. It provides that:\n\nThe application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered... [Emphasis added]\n\n346.\n\nArbitration Rule 50(3)(b)(i) is to the same effect. The Award was rendered on 8 May 2008. The Claimants had to file their claim for annulment by 5 September 2008. However, the Claimants asserted for the first time their request for partial annulment of paragraph 8 of the *dispositif* of the Award in their Counter-Memorial on Annulment which was filed with ICSID on 15 October 2010. The Committee has no hesitation in ruling that it cannot entertain the Claimants\u2019 application which is time-barred.\n\n347.\n\nThe Committee also notes that the Claimants argue that their request, in fact, concerns one of the grounds for annulment pleaded by Chile, *i.e.,* manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention in relation to a section of the Award that is included in Chile\u2019s Application since Chile requested the annulment of the Award as a whole. The Claimants rely on the decision in *Vivendi I* where the committee stated that the respondent in the annulment may present \"its own arguments on questions of annulment, provided that those arguments concern specific matters pleaded by the party requesting annulment\" and \"where a ground for annulment is established, it is for the *ad hoc* committee, and not the requesting party, to determine the extent of the annulment.\"277\n\nSee *Vivendi I* Decision at paras. 68-69.\n\n348.\n\nThe Committee, in the present case, is of the view that the situation is different. While the Claimants base their request on a ground raised by Chile, they invoke a matter that was not debated by Chile, namely the effect of Article 7 of the 1980 Chilean Constitution. As stated by the *Vivendi I* committee as well as by Professor Schreuer \"if one party has requested annulment, the other party should not be allowed to ask for annulment for different reasons outside the time limits of Art. 52(2)\".278\n\nSee *Schreuer Commentary Art. 52* at para. 535.\n\n349.\n\nFinally, the Committee does not agree with the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Professor Schreuer\u2019s Commentary as presented during the hearing on annulment.279 The Claimants relied on the following sentences in paragraphs 536 and 537 of the Commentary:280\n\n536. [...] If additional grounds for annulment come to light during annulment proceedings, they may be relied upon by the parties and used as a basis for annulment by the *ad hoc* committee provided that it is clear that there was no waiver in relation to them through failure to rely on them in a timely fashion. [...]\n\n537. This solution is not contradicted by the time limits contained in Art. 52(2). These time limits relate to an application by a party directed at the institution of annulment proceedings. They do not preclude the *ad hoc* committee from taking cognizance of additional facts once the proceedings are under way. [... ]\n\nSee Tr. Annulment [1] [278:16-281:1] (Eng.); [115:25-116:17] (Fr.); [299:4-301:6] (Spa.).\n\nSee *Schreuer Commentary Art. 52* at paras 536-537.\n\n350.\n\nThe Committee understands that the additional grounds for annulment can only be raised if new facts, which were not known to the parties, come to light during the annulment proceeding as mentioned specifically by Professor Schreuer at the beginning of paragraph 536. The Committee notes that this is not the case here.\n\n351.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Claimants\u2019 request is based on totally different premises than that of the Applicant in the annulment (the Republic of Chile) and is therefore inadmissible because time-barred. The Claimants\u2019 application is therefore dismissed.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n352.\n\nIt remains for the Committee to deal with the question of the costs of these annulment proceedings, as to which the Committee has a discretion. In most of the decisions of annulment committees,281 the committees have decided that each party should bear its own litigation costs and that the costs of the proceeding should be borne equally by the parties.\n\nIn 21 of the 35 published Decisions on Annulment and Discontinuance Orders containing decisions on costs published as of August 10, 2012. See Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, dated August 10, 2012, and available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n353.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee notes that the Tribunal, both on the basis of its conclusions in favour of the Claimants and what it characterized as *\"... la politique adopt\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse consistant, au-del\u00e0 des exceptions usuelles ou \u2018normales\u2019 \u00e0 la competence, \u00e0 multiplier objections et incidents parfois incompatibles avec les usages de l\u2019arbitrage international\"282* condemned the Respondent to contribute US$ 2,000,000 to the costs of representation of the Claimants and to bear 3/4 of the ICSID costs.\n\nSee Award at para. 729.\n\n354.\n\nThe Committee, in the present case, has only annulled that part of the Award dealing with damages. Thus, the pertinent paragraphs of the *dispositif* which deal with costs and which are not annulled by the Decision of the Committee remain in effect. They read as follows:\n\n5. met \u00e0 la charge de la d\u00e9fenderesse une contribution aux frais et d\u00e9pens expos\u00e9s par les demanderesses, d'un montant de USD 2,000,000, - (deux millions);\n\n6. d\u00e9cide que les frais de proc\u00e9dure seront support\u00e9s par les parties dans la proportion de :3/4 du montant total (soit USD 3,136,893.34) pour la d\u00e9fenderesse et 1/4 du montant total (soit 1,045,631.11) pour les demanderesses ; ordonne en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de payer aux demanderesses la somme de USD 1,045,579.35.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 33-45.\n\n355.\n\nWith respect to the annulment proceedings, the Committee notes that Chile has raised different grounds for annulment set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention in respect of eleven specific areas which it has identified. In the view of the Committee, with two exceptions,283 Chile\u2019s claims were, *prima facie,* serious. At the end of the day, the Committee has found only two of the claims to be meritorious, the ones relating to damages.\n\nBias by Arbitrator Bedjaoui and the Tribunal\u2019s *ex aequo et bono* Decision.\n\n356.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants raised one claim for annulment in their Counter-Memorial on Annulment which the Committee dismissed \"without any hesitation\" because it was clearly time-barred.\n\n357.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Committee will not depart from the prevailing practice.\n\n358.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee decides that each party will bear its own litigation costs and the costs of the proceeding will be shared equally by each party.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n359.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee renders the following decisions:\n\n1. Pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) and (e), decides to annul paragraph 4 of the *dispositif* of the Award of 8 May 2008 and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII);\n\n2. Rejects the other grounds of the Republic\u2019s Application for annulment;\n\n3. Rejects the Claimants\u2019 request for the partial annulment of paragraph 8 of the *dispositif* of the Award;\n\n4. Finds that paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 of the *dispositif* as well as the body of the Award but for Section VIII are *res judicata,*\n\n5. Decides that there is no need to order the temporary stay of enforcement of the un-annulled portion of the Award.\n\n6. Decides that each party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding; and\n\n7. Decides that each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding."}, {"Title": "Decision on Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2013-05-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the Committee issued its Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile (the **\"Annulment Decision\"**) partially annulling the award rendered on 8 May 2008 in ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (the **\"Award\"**) between Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation \"President Allende\" (the **\"Claimants\"**) and the Republic of Chile (the **\"Republic\"** or **\"Respondent\"**).\n\n2.\n\nOn 1 February 2013, the Republic submitted a Request for Supplementation of the Annulment Decision **(\"Supplementation Request\")** regarding the application of moratory interests to the amounts owed for costs and expenses pursuant to the unannulled portion of the Award, the Tribunal\u2019s Revision Decision dated 18 November 2009 (the **\"Revision Decision\")** and the Annulment Decision.1 Further to the Parties\u2019 agreement on the schedule for written observations regarding the Supplementation Request, the Republic filed its observations in support of its Supplementation Request on 4 March 2013 and the Claimants filed a response on 29 March 2013.\n\nSee Request at para. 4.\n\n3.\n\nOn April 3, 2013, the Respondent submitted a request for a stay of enforcement of the unannulled portions of the Award (the **\"Request\")** during the pendency of the current proceedings related to the Republic\u2019s Supplementation Request. Upon the invitation of the Committee, the Claimants filed observations on the Request on 8 April 2013 (the **\"Stay Observations\").**\n\n4.\n\nThe Parties submitted further pleadings on the Supplementation Request: on 12 April 2013 the Republic filed its reply (the **\"Reply\")** and on 26 April 2013 the Claimants filed their rejoinder (the **\"Rejoinder\").**\n\n5.\n\nHaving decided to give priority to the consideration of the Request, the Committee on 25 April 2013 issued its decision to reject the Respondent\u2019s Request, with reasons to follow later. This Decision sets out the Committee\u2019s reasons.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Republic submits that a stay of enforcement is necessary to avoid confusion and duplication of proceedings with respect to the unannulled portions of the Award or inconsistent attempts regarding the enforcement thereof.2\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 3 and 5.\n\n7.\n\nIt argues that Rule 54(3) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"**) of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(ICSID** or the **\"Centre\")** establishes this Committee\u2019s power to order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portions of the Award.3\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 6.\n\n8.\n\nThe Republic, citing Professor Schreuer, refers to the \"lopsided situation\" that can occur when an award has been annulled in part and upheld in another, and asserts that an attempt at enforcement of the unannulled costs provision of the Award will inevitably result in confusion and further dispute between the Parties:4\n\nThe power to stay the enforcement of the unannulled portions of an award is intended to help manage the \"more complicated case [of execution]\" of a partially annulled award. In that scenario, \"[p]art of the award remains in existence and would, in theory, be enforceable. But an award that has been annulled in part and upheld in another is likely to create a lopsided situation.\" [Footnote omitted]\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 7 and 8, referring to Christoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge University Press, 2009) Art. 52 at para. 653 (hereinafter *\"Schreuer Commentary\").*\n\n9.\n\nThe Republic makes reference to other ICSID cases in which several committees have found that when a partial annulment affects monetary aspects of an award, stay of enforcement is appropriate:5\n\nFor example, the Committee in *MINE v. Guinea* recognized the necessity of a stay when it annulled part of the award related to damages. Conversely, in *CMS v. Argentine Republic,* the Committee did not grant a stay because the partial annulment of the award did not affect the final monetary amount owed. Similarly, in *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. Ponderosa Assets EP. v. Argentine Republic,* the Committee refused to grant a stay under Article 54(3) of the ICSID Convention because, although it annulled only the portions of the award on damages and liability, its decision rendered the rest of the award unenforceable. [Footnotes omitted]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 9.\n\n10.\n\nThe Republic also refers to the Tribunal\u2019s decision in the present case granting a stay of enforcement during the Revision Proceeding as it considered that the immediate execution of the Award would likely have created problems for the Parties and the Tribunal.6 The Republic argues that the same concerns are present here:7\n\nThe question left open by the Annulment Decision regarding the application of interest to the costs amounts the parties owe each other places in doubt the ultimate sum that the Republic is obligated to pay to Claimants for costs. In view of this uncertainty, any enforcement of the Award would require a judicial court to substitute its judgment for that of the Committee when applying interest, with the risk of an enforcement for the wrong amount, or, conceivably, to deny enforcement of the Award. These outcomes would frustrate the purpose of the Convention, the finality of the Award, and the efforts of the parties to resolve this dispute.8\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 10.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 11.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n11.\n\nThe Republic offers to pay the amount it undisputedly owes Claimants (US$2,470,684.89),9 as a demonstration of its good faith to comply with both the Annulment Decision and the Award, and requests that the Committee issue an order requiring the payment of this undisputed sum in order to fulfill the legal and administrative requirements of the Republic.10\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Reply at para. 28.\n\nSee Request at para. 12.\n\n12.\n\nAdditionally, the Republic points to its long history of honoring its financial commitments, maintaining that because of this previous history, the risk of noncompliance by the Republic or prejudice to the Claimants is non-existent or *de minimis.11*\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 13.\n\n13.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that the time limit to file a request for the supplementation of a decision (45 days from the issuance of said decision pursuant to Arbitration Rule 49(1)) and the pleading schedule established by the Committee will ensure that no prejudicial delay would result from the granting of a stay of enforcement.12\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 14.\n\n14.\n\nIn response to the Republic\u2019s Request, the Claimants aver that the Republic is asking the Committee to reconsider that part of its Annulment Decision regarding the execution of the unannulled portion of the Award, despite the clarity of the terms of the Annulment Decision.13 The Claimants consider that the Republic\u2019s Request is unfounded and is only intended to further delay the compliance by the Republic of its obligations under the Award.14\n\nSee Stay Observations at para. 3.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 4.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Republic\u2019s obligation to pay the Claimants\u2019 costs and expenses related to the arbitration procedure as stated in the Award is *res judicata* since 18 December 2012.15 In the absence of payment from Chile, the Claimants state that they had to initiate enforcement procedures in Spain:\n\n[...] les Demanderesses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019obligation de commencer une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019ex\u00e9cution en Espagne pour forcer le paiement de ces sommes que le Chili a refus\u00e9 de verser volontairement. Contrairement aux all\u00e9gations du Chili, cette proc\u00e9dure est parfaitement justifi\u00e9e et l\u00e9gitime. Les cours espagnoles ont simplement impos\u00e9 au Chili de respecter ses obligations conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Sentence.16\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 5.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n16.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants submit that this Committee is not competent to stay the enforcement of the Award at this stage of the proceedings or to grant the other requests made by the Republic.17 They argue that Arbitration Rule 54(3) clearly states that all stays automatically terminate when the final annulment decision is rendered. The Rule also provides that a committee may only order a temporary stay of enforcement when it grants a partial annulment of an award in order to give either party an opportunity to request a stay to a new tribunal to be constituted further to a resubmission of the dispute. The Claimants submit that this is not the nature of the request made by the Republic of Chile.18\n\nEn r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la demande de suspension sollicit\u00e9e est provisoire pendant \u00ab la demande actuelle de proc\u00e9dure suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00bb.

The Claimants maintain that the Republic\u2019s repeated statements regarding its history of honoring its financial commitments are futile, and submit that \"non seulement le Chili n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 les sommes dues en vertu de la Sentence ; mais il a tout mis en \u0153uvre, en ce inclus le d\u00e9clenchement de proc\u00e9dures abusives et sans fondement, pour \u00e9viter d\u2019honorer ses engagements.\"21\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 18.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants allege that the Request is prejudicial to them since, they say, the Republic seeks to prevent them from proceeding with the resubmission of the dispute. The Claimants conclude that the Respondent\u2019s proposal that they should suspend the enforcement proceedings in Spain in exchange for an order from the Committee that the Respondent should pay the undisputed sum, is not acceptable.22\n\n*Id.* at para. 20.\n\n20.\n\nClaimants maintain that the Committee should abstain from intervening in the enforcement proceedings in Spain as the decision of the Court of 1st instance n\u00b0 101 in Madrid - granting forced enforcement - is well founded considering the *res judicata* effect of the unannulled portions of the Award, as confirmed by the Committee in its Annulment Decision, and in compliance with the obligations of the Convention.23 Additionally, the Claimants state that the provisions of the Spanish law on civil procedure enable the Respondent to claim an offset of the sums owed by the Claimants pursuant to the Revision and Annulment Decisions. The Respondent failed to have recourse to those provisions.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 28, 30 and 32.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants offer to suspend the enforcement proceedings in Spain if the Respondent pays the principal and interest due pursuant to the Award after subtraction of the sums owed by the Claimants pursuant to the Revision and Annulment Decisions. In addition, they are prepared to offer a bank guarantee for the amount equivalent to the accumulated interest until the Committee issues its decision on the Supplementation Request.24\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 42\n\n22.\n\nFinally, the Claimants request that the Respondent be ordered to pay the litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this Request with additional interest from two weeks following the Committee\u2019s Decision at an annual rate of 5 percent until complete payment.25\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 44.\n\n**III. RELEVANT ICSID CONVENTION ARTICLES AND ICSID ARBITRATION RULES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the Convention provides:\n\n(2) The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\n\n24.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the Convention provides:\n\n(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\n\n25.\n\nArticle 53 of the Convention provides:\n\n**Article 53**\n\n(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.\n\n26.\n\nArbitration Rule 54 applies to the present case and provides:\n\n**Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\n\n**IV. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S VIEWS**\n-----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe first question to be addressed is whether the Committee is competent to order a stay of enforcement of the unannulled portions of the Award following the Respondent\u2019s Request. As noted earlier, the Committee rendered its Annulment Decision on 18 December 2012. Within 45 days of the issuance of that Decision, the Respondent filed the Supplementation Request pursuant to Articles 52(4) and 49(2) of the Convention and Arbitration Rules 53 and 49. It is in the context of the Supplementation Request that the Respondent is now asking for a stay of enforcement of the unannulled portions of the Award.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent founds its Request on Arbitration Rule 54(3) which establishes that \"[...] a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\"\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent states that this stay is required to avoid the complicated and lopsided situation in which the Parties are since the Claimants sought enforcement of the principal and interest which they claim Respondent owes in accordance with the Award while the Respondent argues that there are uncertainties with respect to the application of interest.\n\n30.\n\nClaimants, on the other hand, argue that Arbitration Rule 54(3) does not grant the Committee the power to order any stay of enforcement in the present circumstances since that provision only applies when a committee issues a decision on an application for annulment and grants the partial annulment of an award. The Claimants recall that the Committee when it granted such a partial annulment expressly decided that there was no need to order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion of the Award.\n\n31.\n\nWhile the Committee agrees with the Claimants that Arbitration Rule 54(3) does not allow the Committee to grant a stay at the stage of a supplementary decision, the Committee also notes that Arbitration Rule 54(1) provides that \"[...] either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates [...]\".\n\n32.\n\nThus, it appears to the Committee that, by submitting a request for supplementation, the annulment application becomes subject to a new disposition which will become final with the decision on the supplementary decision. Therefore, a party should be allowed to make a request for a stay of enforcement.\n\n33.\n\nThe Committee further notes that Article 52(5) of the Convention provides that a committee \"may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision [...]\". The Committee reads this provision as giving committees a general discretion to grant a stay while an annulment proceeding is pending. The annulment proceeding ended with the issuance of the Annulment Decision on 18 December 2012 but was revived with the registration of the Supplementation Request.\n\n34.\n\nAlthough the provisions of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules on requests for supplementary decisions and rectification do not foresee specifically the possibility of a stay of enforcement of an award, it appears to the Committee that since such a request takes place within the context of an annulment proceeding the party making the application can make the request on the basis of Article 52(5) of the Convention.\n\n35.\n\nHowever, the Committee does not need to rule on this question as it has decided to deny Respondent\u2019s Request as explained below.\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee noted in its Decision on the Republic of Chile\u2019s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated 5 May 2010, that although Article 52(5) of the Convention uses the verb \"may\", thereby conveying an element of discretion to the Committee, a review of the many decisions by *ad hoc* annulment committees since the *MINE* decision in 1988 led the Committee to the conclusion that, absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings had become almost automatic.26\n\nSee Committee\u2019s Decision on the Republic of Chile\u2019s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated 5 May 2010, at para. 25.\n\n37.\n\nThis does not mean that a stay should be granted automatically. A committee needs to be satisfied that the requesting party has discharged its burden of proving that there are specific circumstances justifying a stay. As is well established, factors supporting a stay are: (i) prospects for compliance with the award; (ii) absence of dilatory tactics; (iii) prospects of recoupment of the relevant payment if the award is annulled; and (iv) absence or minimal prejudice to the opposing party by delaying the payment.27\n\nThe Republic had referred to these factors when requesting the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award at the beginning of the proceeding: see letter of 15 January 2010 from Arnold & Porter, L.L.P, to Ms. Eloise Obadia and Transcript Hearing of 29 January 2010, pages 140 to 157 [English Transcripts].\n\n38.\n\nIn the present Request, the Respondent relies essentially on the last two factors above-mentioned insisting on the complications that the risk of an enforcement for the wrong amount would trigger and the minimal prejudice that would result from a further stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n39.\n\nThe Committee disagrees with the Respondent on both counts. Any discrepancy between the amount of enforcement judgment from the Spanish court and the final accounts to be determined further to the Committee\u2019s Decision on the Supplementation Request could easily be resolved. The Claimants have always paid the advances requested by ICSID in relation to this case. They have also offered to provide a bank guaranty for the unliquidated amount of the interest.28 Since the Claimants will certainly resubmit the dispute to a new tribunal for the annulled part of the Award, the Republic of Chile will have the opportunity of claiming any shortfall.\n\nSee Stay Observations at para. 42(2)\n\n40.\n\nAbove all, the Committee notes the binding nature of awards set forth in Article 53 of the Convention. Annulment and other post-award remedies are the exception. As stated in the Background Report on Annulment by the ICSID Secretariat Provided to Contracting States, \"[t]he choice of remedies offered by the ICSID Convention reflects a deliberate election by the drafters of the Convention to ensure finality of awards.\"29 When a revision or annulment proceeding is instituted, the presumption is that the award must be enforced. The stay of enforcement of the award is the exception granted only when specific circumstances so require.\n\nSee Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, dated August 10, 2012, at para. 9 and available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n41.\n\nAdditionally and without prejudice to the decision of the Committee on the Supplementation Request, supplementary decisions and rectifications are not meant to afford a substantive review or reconsideration of the decision.30 Supplementary decisions will most likely have a limited effect on the original decision. This provides an additional reason to preserve the binding force of the unannulled portion of the Award.\n\nSee Schreuer Commentary, Article 49, at para. 28.\n\n42.\n\nAs to the prejudice the Claimants could suffer from any further delay in the payment of the sum owed by Respondent, the Committee finds that since the Award was issued more than 5 years ago, any further delay in the payment of final elements of the Award would be prejudicial to the Claimants.\n\n43.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, the Committee stresses that if it granted any further stay the question of whether interest continues to run during that stay, which is the main issue of the Supplementation Request would arise. Accordingly, by granting a stay, the Committee would add another issue to the issues identified in the Supplementation Request.\n\n44.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee concludes that the Republic of Chile\u2019s request for a stay of the unannulled portions of the Award must be denied.\n\n45.\n\nAccordingly, the other Republic\u2019s requests to order (i) Claimants to suspend any ongoing enforcement proceedings and desist from any further enforcement efforts until the Decision on the Supplementation Request; and (ii) Respondent to pay Claimants the undisputed sum of USD 2,470,684.89 are also denied.\n\n46.\n\nHowever, the Committee is of the view that it would be in the interest of all the Parties if they complied with their respective obligations arising from the Award, the Revision Decision and the Annulment Decision. While the Parties argue the specific issue on the interest which may be due, if any, they do not contest the principal amounts. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Respondent pay Claimants the \"undisputed\" sum of USD 2,470,684.89 which is the sum total of the various obligations of the Parties as described in the table below.\n\n47.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Date** | **Ruling** | **Order** | **Amount** |\n| 8 May 2008 | Award | Respondent ordered to pay part of Claimants\u2019 costs | USD 2,000,000.00 |\n| 8 May 2008 | Award | Respondent ordered to pay Claimants part of costs of arbitration | USD 1,045,627.78 |\n| 18 November 2009 | Revision Decision | Claimants ordered to pay entirety of costs of Revision Proceeding | (USD 200,000.00 + 1,305.11) |\n| 18 December 2012 | Annulment Decision | Claimants ordered to pay half of the costs of Annulment Proceeding | (USD 373,637.78) |\n|  |  | **TOTAL** | **USD 2,470,684.89** |\n\nLastly, with the view to facilitate the enforcement process and taking into account the Committee\u2019s intention to decide the Supplementation Request within a reasonable period of time, the Committee recommends that the Claimants suspend the enforcement proceedings presently pending before the \"Tribunal de 1iere Instance No. 101 de Madrid\" until such time as the Committee issues a decision on the Supplementation Request.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n48.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, and independently of the question whether, at this stage of the proceeding, a committee is competent to grant a stay of enforcement of an award, the Committee unanimously:\n\n- Denies the Republic of Chile\u2019s Request;\n\n- Recommends to the Republic of Chile that it pay forthwith to the Claimants the \"undisputed\" sum of USD 2,470,684.89;\n\n- Recommends to the Claimants that they suspend the enforcement proceedings presently pending before the \"Tribunal de liere Instance No. 101 de Madrid\" until such time as the Committee issues its decision on the Supplementation Request."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for Supplementation of the Annulment Decision", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2013-09-11T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for Supplementation of the Annulment Decision\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the present Committee issued its Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile (the **\"Decision on Annulment\")** partially annulling the award rendered on 8 May 2008 in ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (the **\"Award\")** between Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation \"President Allende\" on one side (the **\"Claimants\")** and the Republic of Chile (the **\"Republic\"** or **\"Respondent\"** or **\"Chile\")** on the other side.\n\n2.\n\nOn 1 February 2013, the Republic submitted an electronic copy of a Request for Supplementation of the Annulment Decision dated 18 December 2012 **(\"Supplementation Request\")** regarding the application of moratory interest to the amounts owed for costs and expenses pursuant to the unannulled portion of the Award, the Tribunal\u2019s decision on revision dated 18 November 2009 (the **\"Decision on Revision\")** and the Decision on Annulment.\n\n3.\n\nThe Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** transmitted the Supplementation Request to the Claimants on 4 February 2013 upon receipt of the hard copies. The ICSID Secretary-General registered the Supplementation Request on 7 February 2013 and transmitted it to the members of the Committee.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of 8 February 2013, the Committee informed the parties that pursuant to Rules 49(3) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"),** it had to fix time limits for the parties to file their observations on the Supplementation Request and determine the procedure for its consideration. The Committee indicated that, in the circumstances, it believed that two rounds of written observations would be necessary to properly consider the Supplementation Request and invited the parties to agree on the schedule for such filings. The Committee further specified that the Republic should be the first to file observations with a view to substantiate its Supplementation Request.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 21 February 2013, the Committee confirmed the schedule agreed upon by the parties for the filing of their written observations and indicated that it did not foresee the need for a hearing on this matter. Accordingly, the Republic filed its observations in support of its Supplementation Request on 4 March 2013 (the **\"Observations\"),** followed by a translation into Spanish of the filing on 11 March 2013. The Claimants filed a response on 29 March 2013 (the **\"Response\"),** followed by its translation into Spanish on 3 April 2013. The Respondent submitted a reply on 12 April 2013 (the **\"Reply\")** and its Spanish translation on 19 April 2013. Finally, the Claimants filed a rejoinder on 26 April 2013 (the **\"Rejoinder\")** and its Spanish version on 2 May 2013.\n\n6.\n\nIn parallel, the Respondent submitted on 3 April 2013 a request for a stay of enforcement of the unannulled portions of the Award. Upon the invitation of the Committee, the Claimants filed observations on the request on 8 April 2013.\n\n7.\n\nHaving decided to give priority to the consideration of that request, the Committee issued its decision rejecting the Respondent\u2019s request on 25 April 2013, with reasons to follow later. The Committee issued its reasoned decision on 16 May 2013.\n\n8.\n\nOn 30 July and 31 July 2013, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively submitted their statements of costs in relation to the Supplementation Request.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Republic\u2019s Contentions**\n---------------------------------\n\n***1. General***\n----------------\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Republic, a Supplementary Decision would serve the purpose of finally determining the applicability or non-applicability of interest to the costs awarded to the Republic, on the one hand, and to the Claimants, on the other hand, in the Arbitration, Revision, and/or Annulment Proceedings in this case.1\n\nSee Supplementation Request at para. 2.\n\n10.\n\nThe Republic submits that it complied with all the specific requirements that must be satisfied in a request for Supplementary Decision as set out in Arbitration Rule 49(1). The Republic has (a) identified the award to which it relates, in this case, the Decision on Annulment dated 18 December 2012, (b) indicated the date of the request which falls within the 45-day deadline established by Article 49(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"Convention\"),** (c) stated in detail the question which, in its opinion, the Committee omitted to decide in the Decision on Annulment, and (d) has lodged the required fee.2\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 6-10.\n\n11.\n\nThe Republic avers that, by virtue of Article 52(4) of Convention, Article 42(2) of the Convention is applicable not only to an award but also to annulment decisions.3\n\nSee Observations at para. 6.\n\n12.\n\nThe Republic maintains that a supplementary decision is appropriate in the present case and, in support of its argument, quoting Professor Christoph Schreuer\u2019s *Commentary,* writes that \"an omission in the relevant decision with respect to the determination of costs is a classic example of the type of issue that can be addressed by means of a supplementary decision pursuant to Art. 49(2).\"4 Professor Schreuer wrote:\n\n\"Supplementation under Art. 49(2) will be useful where the omission is due to an oversight on the part of the tribunal which is likely to be corrected by it once this oversight is pointed out. This oversight should however concern a \u2018question\u2019 before the tribunal; that is, an issue that affects the award and is of sufficient importance to justify the procedure leading to a supplemental decision. **Typical examples would be the inadvertent omission of** an item in the calculation of damages or of **a factor determining costs.\"** [Emphasis in the Observations]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 7.\n\n***2. Interest on the Amounts Awarded by the Tribunal***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Republic submits that it \"wishes to comply in good faith with the portion of the Award [...] which relates to costs, and wishes to do so as promptly as possible\"5 but that, in order to do so, it requires a precise determination by the Committee of the final amounts of costs.6\n\nSee Supplementation Request at para. 3.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n14.\n\nThe Republic contends that the Decision on Annulment did not determine \"whether paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* [providing for moratory interest] should be deemed to apply to the costs amounts identified in paragraphs 5 and 6 of such *dispositif* during the periods of time in which the Revision and Annulment proceedings were pending\"7 and \"the impact (if any) of the fact that the enforcement of the Award had been stayed continuously from a point in time that predated the expiry of the 90-day grace period contemplated in the Award\u2019s *dispositif* until the issuance of the Annulment Decision itself.\"8\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 27.\n\nSee Observations at para. 3.\n\n***3. Interest on the Amounts due for Costs of the Revision Proceeding***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Republic states that \"the Annulment Decision also did not determine whether interest should apply to the costs awarded to the Republic in the Revision Decision dated 18 November 2009 (the \u2018Revision Decision\u2019), which had rejected Claimants\u2019 application for revision of the Award, and imposed on Claimants the obligation of bearing the totality of the costs of the Revision Proceeding.\"9\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 4.\n\n***4. Interest on the Amounts due for Costs of the Annulment Proceeding***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Republic also submits that \"the Annulment Decision did not determine whether interest should apply to the costs that must now be reimbursed to Chile given the Committee\u2019s imposition on Claimants of the obligation to pay half of the costs of the Annulment Proceeding.\"10\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n17.\n\nFinally, and in connection with the Annulment Proceedings, the Republic requests from the Committee the determination, if applicable, of the *dies a quo* on which any interest began to accrue, and the determination of the lapse of time (if any) during which the accrual was interrupted.11\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 28 and 32.\n\n***5. Necessity of a Supplementary Decision***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAs for the necessity of a supplementary decision, the Republic argues that \"[i]nternational tribunals have understood that an Article 49(2) request for supplementation should concern the omission of a material issue but should not seek to modify a decision already made,\"12 and affirms that the \"the Republic has no interest in reopening arguments or reexamining the Committee\u2019s reasoning.\"13\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 24, citing *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision of 28 May 2003 (hereinafter *\"Aguas Supplementary and Rectification Decision\"),* *Alex Genin and others, v. Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Supplementary Decisions and Rectification of 4 April 2002 (hereinafter *\"Genin Supplementary and Rectification Decision\"), LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request For Supplementary Decision of 8 July 2008 (hereinafter *\"LG&E Supplementary Decision\"),* *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for a Supplementary Decision of 13 September 2004.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 27.\n\n19.\n\nThe Republic submits that, while it is able to calculate the total amounts of costs, without interest, which it owes to the Claimants, it is not able to determine the precise amounts owed, until the Committee makes certain determinations concerning the application of interest to this sum.14\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 20-21.\n\n20.\n\nAccording to the Republic, \"this question creates, in effect, a legal impossibility in obtaining the required governmental authorization for payment of the award. Chilean laws stipulating the procedure for payment of an award with public funds are of public order *(de orden p\u00fablico),* and thereby subject to particular legal and constitutional safeguards that demand a much greater degree of legal precision and certainty than the laws governing the payment of judgments between private entities. In short, when the exact amounts at issue remain undetermined, it is not possible for the Republic to proceed with a good faith execution of the Award.\"15\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 30.\n\n***6. The Republic\u2019s Good Faith***\n----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Republic also alleges that \"because enforcement of the Award was subject to a continuous stay from before the moratory interest was triggered until the time the Annulment Decision was issued, it cannot be said that the Republic failed \u2018to comply with a judgment or an arbitral award without delay\u2019, or entered into the situation of default that Paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* was intended to avert.\"16\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 33.\n\n22.\n\nMore specifically, the Republic contends that the moratory interest provided for in paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* \"was to become applicable only if the Republic were to fail to pay within the required ninety-day grace period.\"17 The Republic asserts that it \"never reached the point of default, because the tribunal granted a stay of enforcement of the Award starting from 5 August 2008 - the day *before* the moratory interest was to begin accruing pursuant to the Award\" and \"[s]uch stay then remained continuously in force [...] until 18 December 2012, when the stay was lifted in the Decision on Annulment.\"18 [Emphasis in the original]\n\nSee Reply at para. 12.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n23.\n\nFinally, in the words of the Republic, it assumes that \"at the very least, interest should not accrue during this period [i.e., the period of time in which the Revision Proceeding was ongoing], given that the corresponding delay was attributable entirely to the Claimants, for having commenced a Revision Proceeding in which it was ultimately entirely unsuccessful and with respect to which it was obligated to pay the total sum of the costs.\"19\n\nSee Observations at para. 35.\n\n**7.** ***The Republic \u2019s Requests***\n-------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Republic requests that the Committee:20\n\n\"a. Issue a Supplementary Decision to the Annulment Decision wherein it determines a sum certain the Republic is obligated to pay Claimants, after assessing:\n\ni. how the moratory interest contemplated in Paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* should be applied to the amounts in costs and expenses the Republic is obligated to pay Claimants, given that the Republic was never in default due to the stays of enforcement that were in effect from 5 August 2008 until 18 December 2012;\n\nii. if applicable, the *dies a quo* of any interest on costs imposed on the Republic for the Arbitration proceeding, and whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time;\n\niii. whether interest has accrued \u2014 and continues to accrue\u2014 on the costs imposed on Claimants for the Revision Proceeding;\n\niv. if applicable, the *dies a quo* of any interest on costs for the Revision Proceeding, and whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time;\n\nv. whether interest should be deemed to accrue on the costs imposed on Claimants for the Annulment Proceeding; and\n\nvi. if applicable, the *dies a quo* of any interest on costs for the Annulment Proceeding, and whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time.\n\nb. Order Claimants to pay the full costs of this proceeding, plus applicable interest.\"\n\nSee Reply at para. 32.\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Contentions**\n---------------------------------\n\n***1. Waiver of the Right to Submit the Request for a Supplementary Decision***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nIn their Response to the Republic\u2019s Supplementation Request, the Claimants aver firstly that, in the Annulment Proceeding, the Republic never asked the Committee to decide the specific requests that it is making now.21 Accordingly, a supplementary decision by the Committee on this issue, argue the Claimants, would violate the letter and spirit of Article 49(2) of the Convention, as it would amount to revisiting the merits of the Decision on Annulment.22 In the words of the Claimants, \"si l\u2019article 49(2) de la Convention CIRDI permet de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une omission du tribunal arbitral, il doit imp\u00e9rativement s\u2019agir d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9e au tribunal et sur laquelle il avait omis de se prononcer. Le Professeur Schreuer souligne que l\u2019obtention d\u2019une d\u00e9cision suppl\u00e9mentaire est li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 48(3) de cette m\u00eame Convention qui dispose que la sentence doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes les questions pos\u00e9es au tribunal arbitral.\"23\n\nSee Response at para. 3.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 4.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 8\n\n26.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"dans la mesure o\u00f9 les demandes formul\u00e9es par la D\u00e9fenderesse dans sa demande de d\u00e9cision suppl\u00e9mentaire sont des demandes nouvelles, il ne peut en aucun cas s\u2019agir d\u2019une omission au sens de l\u2019article 49(2).\"24\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 9.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants quote Professor Christoph Schreuer\u2019s *Commentary* in respect of Article 46 of the Convention and argue that moratory interest must be denied when it has not been specifically requested. Professor Schreuer wrote:\n\n\"Post-award (moratory) interest is usually addressed separately by the tribunals. It must be requested expressly by the claimant. In some cases post-award interest was denied because it had not been specifically mentioned in claimants\u2019 memorials.\"25 [Emphasis in the Response and footnote omitted]\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 13.\n\n***2. Interest on the Amounts Awarded by the Tribunal***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Republic seeks to cap the amount that it is required to pay \"soit en suspendant l\u2019application des int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires lorsque ces derniers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9s, soit en appliquant des int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires en l\u2019absence de d\u00e9cision,\"26 and they conclude that \"il est de principe que si un tribunal ou un comit\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9voit pas dans sa sentence ou sa d\u00e9cision l\u2019octroi d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires, il convient de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas en accorder.\"27\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 12.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 15.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants refer the Committee to decisions of annulment committees which, they say, determined that \"[l]es int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires courent pendant la suspension de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution provisoire et ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du complet paiement.\"28\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 27-35 citing *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 4 Nov. 2008, para. 40; *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 28 Dec. 2007, (hereinafter *\u2018Azurix Decision on the Stay of Enforcement\")* para. 40; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005, p. 139; and Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 1 Sept. 2006, (hereinafter *\"CMS Decision on the Stay of Enforcement* \u2019), p. 50; *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Award of 20 May 1992; *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. c. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award of 25 May 2004.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the Tribunal determined in paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* the interest to be applied, the *dies a quo* and the *dies at quem,29* that the Republic has never before requested the modification of this part of the *dispositif* and that this paragraph 7 was specifically confirmed by the Annulment Committee.30 The Claimants further state that, even if the Republic had made such a request, the Committee would not have had jurisdiction to modify this paragraph of the Award without annulling it.31\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 36.\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 37-38.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 42.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the interest awarded by the Tribunal must be considered as having accrued according to the terms of the Award, without any modification. Accordingly, \"les int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s au taux de 5% annuel ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir depuis le 8 mai 2008 (date d\u2019envoi de la Sentence) sans interruption et continueront de courir jusqu\u2019au complet paiement des sommes dues.\"32\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 43.\n\n***3. Interest on the Amounts due for Costs of the Revision Proceeding***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nAs for the costs of the Revision Proceeding, the Claimants affirm that the Republic had never before requested the application of interest to these costs, and that in the absence of such an express request, the Tribunal could not grant them. The Claimants further contend that the Republic cannot submit such a request to the Committee since it has no jurisdiction to address it.33\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 50-51.\n\n***4. Interest on the Amounts due for Costs of the Annulment Proceeding***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAs for the costs of the Annulment Proceeding, the Claimants state that the Republic never requested that interest accrue on those costs and, in addition, that the Committee had clearly decided to order the Claimants to reimburse half of the costs of this proceeding to Chile without interest.34\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 54.\n\n***5. Necessity of a Supplementary Decision***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that a supplementary decision is not necessary for the Republic to fulfill its obligations under the Decision on Annulment. They write that \"la Sentence \u00e9tait imm\u00e9diatement ex\u00e9cutoire et la R\u00e9publique du Chili avait 90 jours \u00e0 partir du 8 mai 2008 pour payer les sommes auxquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Sentence, des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s seraient appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019envoi de la Sentence.\"35\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 20.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants recall that the Republic itself has repeatedly stated that \"le pr\u00e9judice des Demanderesses du fait de la suspension provisoire de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence [\u00e9tait] compens\u00e9 par la capitalisation des int\u00e9r\u00eats pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\"36 \"Ainsi, le maintien de la production d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats capitalis\u00e9s pendant la suspension provisoire de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 par la R\u00e9publique du Chili elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019elle a argument\u00e9 en faveur de la suspension d\u2019ex\u00e9cution.\"37 The Claimants submit that the Republic cannot now revoke its statements and reduce the amount owed pursuant to the Award.38\n\n*Ibid,* at paras. 21-26.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 24.\n\n*Ibid,* at para 24.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Republic has not introduced any evidence with respect to the impossibility of obtaining the required governmental authorization for payment of the amounts owed and add that, in any event, \"conform\u00e9ment aux articles 26 et 27 de la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des trait\u00e9s, de 1969, ratifi\u00e9e par l\u2019Espagne et le Chili, une partie ne peut invoquer les dispositions de son droit interne comme justifiant la non-execution d'un trait\u00e9.\"39\n\nSee Rejoinder at para. 29.\n\n***6. The Republic\u2019s Dilatory Tactic***\n---------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the purpose of the Republic\u2019s Request for Supplementation is to delay the payment of the amount owed and state that \"[l]a demande de d\u00e9cision suppl\u00e9mentaire proc\u00e8de de la m\u00eame volont\u00e9 des autorit\u00e9s chiliennes de ne pas indemniser les parties Demanderesses ; de ne pas ex\u00e9cuter ni reconna\u00eetre conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses termes la Sentence.

En effet, le 22 mars 2013, le repr\u00e9sentant de la R\u00e9publique du Chili dans cet arbitrage d\u00e9clarait que les termes de la sentence '*ne seraient pas fermes, il existe un recours en cours aux EE. UU.\u2019* (d\u00e9clarations du 22 mars 2013 de l\u2019agent de la R\u00e9publique du Chili -le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 des Investissements Etrangers- publi\u00e9s dans des nombreux moyens de communication).\"40\n\nSee Response at para. 78.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants allege that this Request is nothing more than a dilatory tactic: \"[o]n rel\u00e8vera que les deux suspensions de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es sur la seule demande et \u00e0 l\u2019avantage exclusif de la D\u00e9fenderesse, et ne sauraient par aucune approche \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme autre chose que des interdictions faites aux Demanderesses de mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019exigence de paiement du principal et des int\u00e9r\u00eats figurant aux points 5 \u00e0 7 du dispositif de la Sentence, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la lev\u00e9e de ces suspensions - retard au seul d\u00e9triment des Demanderesses estim\u00e9, selon le Tribunal Arbitral et le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* respectivement, compens\u00e9 par l\u2019accumulation des int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires \u00e0 laquelle il donnerait lieu.\"41\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 82.\n\n**7.** ***Modification of the Republic\u2019s Original Request***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, in its Reply, the Republic has modified its original request for a supplementary decision by requesting that the Committee \"issue a Supplementary Decision to the Annulment Decision wherein it determines a sum certain the Republic is obligated to pay Claimants [...]\".42 The Claimants submit that \"[e]n premier lieu, on rappellera que le Comit\u00e9 *ad hoc* n\u2019\u00e9tant pas comp\u00e9tent pour d\u00e9cider de la demande initiale de la R\u00e9publique du Chili, il est \u00e9galement incomp\u00e9tent pour statuer sur cette \u2018nouvelle\u2019 demande.

The Claimants\u2019 Requests***\n--------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Committee dismiss the Request for Supplementation of the Decision on Annulment and, confirm (1) that paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* are *res judicata,* (2) that according to the Award as well as the 18 November 2009 and 18 December 2012 Decisions, the Claimants are not required to pay interest to the Republic; (3) that the Committee did not omit to decide any question; and (4) that the Republic should pay for all the costs of the present proceeding, including the representational costs, with additional compound interest from two weeks following the Committee\u2019s Decision at an annual rate of 5 percent until complete payment.45\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 49.\n\n**C. The Republic\u2019s Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Contention on Waiver by the Republic of the Right to Submit the Request for a Supplementary Decision**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants\u2019 argument regarding the waiver of the rights to submit the Supplementation Request, the Republic submits that \"it is preposterous to assert that the Republic waived its right to have these questions decided by not having requested expressly that the Committee do so during the Annulment Proceeding. A party cannot be expected to anticipate and raise issues that it reasonably expects the tribunal or Committee to address as a result of the questions that such party did in fact present to the adjudicator for decision.\"46\n\nSee Reply at para. 7.\n\n43.\n\nThe Republic also states that \"under Claimants\u2019 logic, the Republic would have had to expand its request for relief to account for every conceivable outcome, expressly asking the Committee to decide all issues that could logically flow from each potential outcome. This cannot possibly be the applicable standard, as it would defy common sense. An annulment applicant in the ICSID system is entitled to expect that the annulment decision, in addressing the issues explicitly raised for determination, will also address all residual questions that logically flow from its decision on the issues presented.\"47\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 9.\n\n**III. RELEVANT ICSID CONVENTION ARTICLES AND ICSID ARBITRATION RULES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the Convention provides:\n\n\"(2) The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\"\n\n45.\n\nArticle 52(4) of the Convention provides:\n\n\"(4) The provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\"\n\n46.\n\nArbitration Rule 49 applies to the present case and provides:\n\n**\"Supplementary Decisions and Rectification**\n\n(1) Within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered, either party may request, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention, a supplementary decision on, or the rectification of, the award.

The request shall:\n\n(a) identify the award to which it relates;\n\n(b) indicate the date of the request;\n\n(c) state in detail:\n\n(i) any question which, in the opinion of the requesting party, the Tribunal omitted to decide in the award; and\n\n(ii) any error in the award which the requesting party seeks to have rectified; and\n\n(d) be accompanied by a fee for lodging the request.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of the request and of the lodging fee, the Secretary-General shall forthwith:\n\n(a) register the request;\n\n(b) notify the parties of the registration;\n\n(c) transmit to the other party a copy of the request and of any accompanying documentation; and\n\n(d) transmit to each member of the Tribunal a copy of the notice of registration, together with a copy of the request and of any accompanying documentation.\n\n(3) The President of the Tribunal shall consult the members on whether it is necessary for the Tribunal to meet in order to consider the request.

LEGAL STANDARDS**\n-----------------------\n\n47.\n\nBefore addressing the issues raised by the Republic\u2019s Supplementation Request, the Committee considers it appropriate to review the standards applicable for the supplementation of an annulment decision.\n\n48.\n\nBoth parties agree that the purpose of the procedure set forth in Article 49(2) of the Convention is to give an opportunity to a tribunal (or a committee pursuant to Article 52(4) of the Convention) to decide a question that it would have omitted to resolve in its award (or decision for a committee).48\n\nSee Observations at para. 22 and Response at para. 3.\n\n49.\n\nThe parties also agree that a request for supplementation may not be used to ask a committee to revisit in any way the merits of its decision.49\n\nSee Observations at para. 24; Response at para. 4; *LG&E Supplementary Decision* at para. 16; *and Aguas Supplementary and Rectification Decision* at para. 11.\n\n50.\n\nThe Committee subscribes to these views and notes that the power of a committee to decide a question which it had omitted to decide is discretionary. Article 49(2) of the Convention provides that the committee *\"may* after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide\" (Emphasis added).\n\n51.\n\nIn the present case, the central issue lies with the precise questions which the Committee would have omitted to decide.\n\n52.\n\nOn the one hand, the Respondent submits that the Committee should issue a supplementary decision in order that the exact sum it owes to the Claimants may be determined. To arrive at such determination, the Republic asks four series of questions to the Committee. They are: (i) whether any moratory interest should be applied to the amount of costs and expenses that the Republic is obligated to pay to the Claimants pursuant to the Award and, if so, what is the *dies a quo* for the calculation of such interest; (ii) whether the Claimants should pay interest on the amount due for the costs of the Revision Proceeding which were granted by the Tribunal, and, if applicable, what is the *dies a quo* for the application of such interest; (iii) whether the Claimants should pay interest on the amount due for the costs of the Annulment Proceeding which were granted by the Committee, and, if applicable, what is the *dies a quo* for the application of such interest; and (iv) more generally, what is the impact of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award on any interest which may have accrued.50\n\nSee Reply at para. 32.\n\n53.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants argue that none of these questions were actually submitted by the Respondent to the Committee and that, therefore, the Committee should reject the Supplementation Request.51\n\nSee Rejoinder at paras. 4 and 7.\n\n54.\n\nIt is well settled that a committee is only competent to issue a supplementary decision if it failed to deal with and dispose of a question that was put to it. In the *Genin* case, the tribunal noted:52\n\n\"10. With respect to the supplementary decisions requested by Claimants, the Tribunal considers it necessary to state that these do not concern questions which it omitted to decide. Rather, they relate to issues that Claimants themselves failed virtually altogether to address in either their written or oral submissions in the arbitration.\"\n\nSee *Genin Supplementary and Rectification Decision* at para. 10.\n\n55.\n\nThe Committee finds apposite the statement of the *Enron* tribunal that:53\n\n\"42. The issue lies in a different proposition, namely whether this can be done by a **tribunal in the absence of a request to that effect.** The Tribunal concluded and now reiterates that, just as it must decide a matter that has been duly submitted and petitioned, the same is conversely true that this cannot be done if not requested, as this would amount to an excess of power which, as the Respondent explains, can result in a decision that is *ultra petita* and thus subject to the sanction of an annulment.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nSee *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision of 25 October 2007 (hereinafter *\"Enron Rectification and Supplementary Decision\")* at para. 42.\n\n56.\n\nAlthough the decision of an *ad hoc* committee may not be the subject of an annulment, it is evident that a committee cannot decide a matter that has not been submitted to it. In the Background Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID, the Committee notes the following:54\n\n\"52. The procedure before an *ad hoc* Committee normally corresponds to the procedure before a Tribunal. *Ad hoc* Committees must afford both parties the right to be heard and must respect the equality of the parties.\"\n\nSee Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, dated 10 August 2012, available at http : //www. worldbank. org/ic sid. (hereinafter *\"ICSID Background Paper on Annulment\")* at para. 52.\n\n57.\n\nThe Committee is further comforted in its view by the obligation which it has pursuant to Article 48(3) of the Convention (and Article 52(4)) to \"deal with every question\" submitted to it. The corollary of this obligation is that every question must have been submitted to it.55\n\nSee Rejoinder at paras. 4 and 7.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent replies to this argument of the Claimants by stating that an issue can be deemed subsumed within, or implicit in the larger question presented.56 It adds that:57\n\n\"Under Claimants\u2019 logic, the Republic would have had to expand its request for relief to account for every conceivable outcome, expressly asking the Committee to decide all issues that could logically flow from each potential outcome. This cannot possibly be the applicable standard, as it would defy common sense. An annulment applicant in the ICSID system is entitled to expect that the annulment decision, in addressing the issues explicitly raised for determination, will also address all residual questions that logically flow from its decision on the issues presented.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nSee Reply at para. 8.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 9.\n\n59.\n\nWhile the Committee does not agree that it is competent to address all residual questions that flow logically from its decision on the questions actually submitted to it by the Republic, it does agree that it is competent to deal with and dispose of a question that has been impliedly raised by the Respondent.\n\n60.\n\nThe tribunal in*Enron* adopted a similar approach:58\n\n\"43. In this case it is quite evident that pre-award interest was expressly requested, but not so with respect to post-award interest. If not expressly requested, the next question for the Tribunal is whether post-award interest can be considered as having been impliedly requested.\"\n\nSee *Enron Rectification and Supplementary Decision* at para. 43.\n\n61.\n\nThe Committee will therefore analyze each question put to it by the Republic in its Request to determine if the question was, expressly or impliedly, submitted to it in the Annulment Proceeding.\n\n62.\n\nAlthough the arguments of the parties were presented differently, the Committee finds it more convenient to address *\"seriatim\"* the four categories of questions detailed above: (i) questions related to the Award; (ii) questions related to the Decision on Revision; (iii) questions related to the Decision on Annulment; and (iv) the impact of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**V. COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Committee recalls that, by virtue of its Supplementation Request, Chile seeks mainly to determine the exact amount it needs to pay to the Claimants pursuant to paragraphs 5 to 7 of the operative part of the Award.\n\n64.\n\nWhile such a determination appears to come within the scope of the Committee\u2019s competence since the Committee annulled the Award partially and also issued a decision on the costs of the proceeding, the Committee needs to address each specific category of questions in order to determine whether it is competent to answer Chile\u2019s central question.\n\n**A. Questions Related to the Award**\n-------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent phrased its questions related to the Award as follows:59\n\n\"i. how the moratory interest contemplated in Paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* should be applied to the amounts in costs and expenses the Republic is obligated to pay Claimants, given that the Republic was never in default due to the stays of enforcement that were in effect from 5 August 2008 until 18 December 2012;\n\nii. if applicable, the *dies a quo* of any interest on costs imposed on the Republic for the Arbitration proceeding, and whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time.\"\n\nSee Reply at para. 32.\n\n66.\n\nIn connection with these questions, Chile alleges that:60\n\n\"Although in the Annulment Decision the Committee decided that Paragraph 7 of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* was not annulled, it did not decide if the moratory interest contemplated therein ought to be applied to the costs and expenses awarded Claimants. Such a determination was necessary given the dual fact that at no time was the Republic ever in default of the Award, and that the Republic was not unsuccessful in its annulment petition.\"\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 6.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it never reached the point of default because a stay of enforcement of the Award was granted by the Tribunal starting from 5 August 2008 and confirmed by the Committee until 18 December 2012 when the stay was lifted in the Decision on Annulment.61\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 12.\n\n68.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Committee considers that it is not competent to decide these questions.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent in its Supplementation Request is asking questions regarding the implementation of the Award that were not put to the Committee during the Annulment Proceeding. Indeed, the Respondent never raised any ground for annulment with respect to the granting of moratory interest by the Tribunal. While it asked for the annulment of the entirety of the Award, it did not specifically raise the question of post-award interest.\n\n70.\n\nAssuming, *arguendo,* that this question could be a question subsumed in the ones related to the consequences of a partial annulment, the Committee recalls that it was very clear on the consequences of the partial annulment which it issued. Paragraph 4 of the operative part of the Decision on Annulment provides as follows:\n\n\"4. Finds that paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 of the *dispositif* as well as the body of the Award but for Section VIII are *res judicata\"*\n\n71.\n\nFor ease of reference, the Committee will set out paragraphs 5 to 7 of the *dispositif* of the Award:\n\n\"5. met \u00e0 la charge de la d\u00e9fenderesse une contribution aux frais et d\u00e9pens expos\u00e9s par les demanderesses, d\u2019un montant de USD 2,000,000,-(deux millions) ;\n\n6. d\u00e9cide que les frais de proc\u00e9dure seront support\u00e9s par les parties dans la proportion de : 3/4 du montant total (soit USD 3,136,893.34) pour la d\u00e9fenderesse et 1/4 du montant total (soit 1,045,631.11) pour les demanderesses ; ordonne en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de payer aux demanderesses la somme de USD 1,045,579.35 ;\n\n7. ordonne \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique du Chili de proc\u00e9der au paiement dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence, des sommes figurant dans le pr\u00e9sent dispositif (points 4, 5 et 6), faute de quoi le montant portera int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s annuellement au taux de 5%, \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence jusqu\u2019\u00e0 celle du parfait paiement.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n72.\n\nAs is abundantly clear, the Tribunal granted post-award interest accruing from 8 May 2008, date of dispatch of the Award, until full payment. The Tribunal did not include in its Award any circumstance where the Respondent could be relieved from its obligation to pay interest. Accordingly, the Committee, which was not asked any question about moratory interest, confirmed the *res judicata* effect of these parts of the Award which were not annulled, including paragraph 7 of the *dispositif.*\n\n73.\n\nIt appears to the Committee that the Respondent is requesting an interpretation of the Award rather than a decision from the Committee in respect of questions it would have omitted to decide.\n\n74.\n\nThe interpretation of an award is available to assist the parties with a question of practical relevance for an award\u2019s implementation.62 Under Article 50 of the Convention, a request for interpretation must however be submitted to the tribunal that has rendered the award.\n\nSee *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Application for Interpretation of the Arbitral Award dated December 8, 2000 of 31 October 2005, at paras. 87-88.\n\n75.\n\nIn addition, annulment decisions are not subject to interpretation under the Convention. The Committee notes that Article 50 of the Convention which provides for the interpretation of an award is excluded from the list of provisions of the Convention which apply *\"mutadis mutandis\"* to annulment proceedings.63\n\nSee Article 52(4) of the Convention.\n\n76.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, this exclusion, in the context of one of the central objects of the Convention, to wit, the finality of awards, makes perfect sense. Otherwise, the finality of awards could be jeopardized which would run contrary to the intention of the drafters of the Convention.\n\n77.\n\nAs was stated in the *ICSID Background Paper on Annulment,* \"[t]he choice of remedies offered by the ICSID Convention reflects a deliberate election by the drafters of the Convention to ensure finality of awards.\"64\n\nSee *ICSID Background Paper on Annulment* at para. 9.\n\n78.\n\nSince there cannot be any interpretation of an annulment decision, it stands to reason that there can never be an interpretation of an award by a committee after it has rendered its annulment decision.\n\n79.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Supplementation Request related to these questions is rejected.\n\n**B. Questions related to the Revision Proceeding**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants requested a revision of the Award in June 2008. The request was rejected by the Tribunal on 18 November 2009 and, as a result, the Award was not modified. In its decision, the Tribunal ordered the Claimants to pay the costs of the Revision Proceeding. The relevant part of the *dispositif* reads as follows:\n\n\"4) Ordonne, quant aux frais de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure en r\u00e9vision, qu'ils seront support\u00e9s par les Parties demanderesses, qui succombent, pour un montant de 431,000 USD.\"\n\n81.\n\nAs both parties had advanced the costs of the Revision Proceeding in accordance with Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d), the Claimants were obliged to reimburse half of the costs to the Respondent.\n\n82.\n\nThe Republic argues that in order to calculate the sum certain that it must pay the Claimants, it must know the exact amount owed by the Claimants which needs to be subtracted.65 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Committee should decide whether interest applies to the amount owed by the Claimants.\n\nSee Reply at para. 20.\n\n83.\n\nThe Republic argues that \"if moratory interest is deemed applicable with respect to the costs imposed in the Award, such interest should be applied in a similar fashion and terms to the costs imposed on Claimants [...].\"66\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 21.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s questions related to the Revision proceeding are phrased as follows:67\n\n\"iii. whether interest has accrued \u2014 and continues to accrue\u2014 on the costs imposed on Claimants for the Revision Proceeding;\n\niv. if applicable, the *dies a quo* of any interest on costs for the Revision Proceeding, and whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time.\"\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 32.\n\n85.\n\nFor the reasons which follow, the Committee considers that it is not competent to address these questions.\n\n86.\n\nArticle 52 of the Convention provides that a committee can only review an award. The Committee is of the view that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 50(3)(b)(i), if the award is followed by a revision, the annulment shall have regard to the award as so revised. However, there cannot be any annulment of a decision rejecting a revision request, which is the case here.\n\n87.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants that Chile could have asked these questions to the Tribunal within 45 days of the issuance of the Decision on Revision provided that it had claimed such moratory interest during the Revision Proceeding.68 The Committee also agrees with the Claimants that it is not clear from the record before it whether the Respondent asked for such interest.\n\nSee Response at para. 51.\n\n88.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Supplementation Request related to these questions is rejected.\n\n**C. Questions related to the Annulment Proceeding**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nWith respect to the Decision on Annulment, the Respondent asks the following questions to the Committee:69\n\n\"v. whether interest should be deemed to accrue on the costs imposed on Claimants for the Annulment Proceeding; and\n\nvi. if applicable, the *dies a quo* of any interest on costs for the Annulment Proceeding, and whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time.\"\n\nSee Reply at para. 32.\n\n90.\n\nThe Committee recalls that, in its December 18, 2012 Decision, it decided *inter alia* that:\n\n\"6. [...] each party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\"\n\n91.\n\nAs the advance payments for the Annulment Proceeding were made by the Applicant - Chile - in accordance with Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), the Claimants, as a result of the Committee\u2019s decision, were obliged to reimburse half of these costs to the Republic.\n\n92.\n\nThese two questions, on their face, relate to the Decision on Annulment. Accordingly, the Committee must first ascertain whether the Republic had actually put these questions to the Committee.\n\n93.\n\nThe Committee notes that, in its Memorial on Annulment, the Republic asked the Committee to \"award the Republic of Chile all of its costs and expenses associated with this Annulment Proceeding, including attomey[s\u2019] fees and all fees and costs incurred in connection with the \u2018admissibility\u2019 objections presented by the Claimants at the outset of the proceeding.\"70\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Annulment of 10 June 2010 at pp. 368-369.\n\n94.\n\nIn its Reply on Annulment, Chile requested that the Committee \"[g]rant the Republic of Chile an appropriate award of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in this annulment proceeding.\"71 While the Respondent added a note on the appropriateness of granting costs, it did not claim any post-decision interest on the costs imposed on the Claimants for the Annulment Proceeding.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment of 22 December 2010 at para. 550.\n\n95.\n\nThus it is clear, and the Committee so finds, that Chile did not expressly request from the Committee interest on costs.\n\n96.\n\nNor, in the view of the Committee, can the Republic\u2019s words in its request for relief \"grant[ing] an appropriate award of costs...\" be considered as an implied request to the Committee for the granting of interest.\n\n97.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Supplementation Request related to these questions is rejected.\n\n**D. Impact of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award on Interest**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that its obligation to pay moratory interest \"had not yet begun at all by the time of the Annulment Decision, due to the continuous stay of enforcement of the Award\".72\n\nSee Observations at para. 31.\n\n99.\n\nMore specifically, the Republic asserts that moratory interest accrues during periods in which a stay of enforcement is in place \"only if (a) the annulment petitioner was the party that requested the stay; *and (b) such party is unsuccessful in its post-award challenge.\"73* (Emphasis in original)\n\nSee Reply at para. 13.\n\n100.\n\nThus, concludes the Respondent, since \"[it] was never on the losing side of a proceeding that needlessly delayed payment\", the payment of the costs that the Republic owes to the Claimants pursuant to the Award \"did not become truly due and payable until the date of the Decision on Annulment\".74\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 16.\n\n101.\n\nThe precise question asked by the Republic to the Committee is \"whether the relevant accrual period was interrupted for any lapse of time\".75\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 32.\n\n102.\n\nThe Committee reiterates that it is only competent to decide this question if it was posed to it.\n\n103.\n\nThe Committee acknowledges that, if the Republic had raised the question during the Annulment Proceeding, the Committee could have ruled on the impact of the stay of enforcement - that it granted while the Annulment Proceeding was on-going - on the accrual of interest.\n\n104.\n\nHowever, the Committee finds that the Republic did not ask this specific question, nor could it be said that it was implied, therefore no supplementary decision can be made today.\n\n105.\n\nIn this connection, the Committee recalls that it dealt specifically with this matter in its Decision of 5 May 2010 on the Republic of Chile\u2019s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award when it stated:\n\n\"32. It is a fact that, because of the Application, the satisfaction of the Award (assuming that the Application is unsuccessful) will be delayed. In the view of the Committee that is the only prejudice which the Claimants can point to. But, the provision for compound interest in the \u2018dispositif of the Award compensates the Claimants adequately for the delay.\"\n\n106.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Republic itself endorsed this position in support of its request for a stay. It submitted expressly that the Claimants would not be prejudiced by a stay:76\n\n\"since the Award provides for the granting of compound interest until the date of actual payment on the amount granted. In this regard, the MTD Committee held that \u2018... in the Committee\u2019s view Chile has demonstrated that MTD will not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other than in respect of the delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which can be remedied by the payment of interest in the event that the annulment application is unsuccessful.\u2019\"\n\nSee Letter of 15 January 2010 from the Republic to Ms. Eloise Obadia at page 4.\n\n107.\n\nIn the circumstances, interest has continued to accrue on the sums due pursuant to the Award while the enforcement was stayed.\n\n108.\n\nMany *ad hoc* committees have referred to the fact that if an award granted interest, particularly compound interest, up to the date of payment, it was logical to deny a request by the respondent to provide a guarantee in exchange for a stay.\n\n109.\n\nFor example, in *CMS v. Argentina,* the committee concluded that:77\n\n\"having regard to this commitment, the Committee is of the opinion that Argentina had demonstrated that CMS will not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other that in respect of the delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which can be remedied by the payment of interest in the event that the annulment application is unsuccessful.\"\n\n*CMS Decision on the Stay of Enforcement* at para 50.\n\n110.\n\nIn *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina,* the committee explained that \"the determinative issue is whether, beyond delay compensated for by interest, there is any factor here militating for the imposition of security for payment over and above that provided for by Argentina\u2019s commitments under the ICSID Convention.\"78 In this regard, the committee stated that \"the Committee does not accept that Azurix suffers any prejudice of a kind warranting the provision of security. The provision for interest compensates for the delay.\"79\n\n*Azurix Decision on the Stay of Enforcement* at para. 44.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 40.\n\n111.\n\nIn response to the Republic\u2019s argument that it was successful in the Annulment Proceeding and that the remedy of the interest did not come into play, the Committee notes that the Respondent was only partially successful. The portions of the Award which were not annulled include paragraph 7 of the *dispositif* reproduced earlier in the present decision.\n\n112.\n\nFinally, the Republic argues that the application of moratory interest during the Revision Proceeding would be illogical since, on the one hand, it was initiated by the Claimants and, on the other hand, the Claimants were unsuccessful.\n\n113.\n\nThe Committee finds this argument of the Republic unpersuasive. There is no basis for differentiating between a stay granted during a proceeding initiated by one party and a stay granted pursuant to a proceeding initiated by the beneficiary of the stay.\n\n114.\n\nIn so far as the Revision Proceeding is concerned, it was indeed initiated by the Claimants but the Respondent requested the stay. It was Chile\u2019s choice to request such a stay and the Committee notes that the Republic could have asked for a partial stay of the Award while paying the amounts due as costs and expenses. The Revision Proceeding was directed to the sections of the Award and the conclusions dealing with liability and damages, not the costs.80\n\nSee Application for Revision of 2 June 2008, at para. 54 (CN-244) and Claimants\u2019 Reply on Revision of 3 November 2008, at para 73 (CN-245).\n\n115.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Republic must pay to the Claimants the sum it owes under paragraphs 5 to 7 of the operative part of Award that are *res judicata.*\n\n116.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this means that Chile must pay compound interest accruing annually at 5% on USD 2,000,000.00 and USD 1,045,627.78 (sums indicated by the Tribunal in its Award as adjusted by ICSID in April 2013), from 8 May 2008 until 19 June 2013, date when the principal amount due minus the sums owed by the Claimants was paid by Chile. Additionally, compound interest will continue to run on the interest accrued (from 8 May 2008 until 19 June 2013) until complete payment.81\n\nThe Committee notes that since the Respondent has paid the principal amount on 19 June 2013, the compound interest will continue to run on the balance of the total sum due as of 19 June 2013 minus USD 3,045,627.78.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n117.\n\nIt remains for the Committee to deal with the question of costs for this phase of the Annulment Proceeding. The Republic asked the Committee to \"order Claimants to pay the full costs of this proceeding, plus applicable interest.\"82 In turn, the Claimants asked that the Committee order the Republic to pay for all the costs of the present proceeding, including the representational costs, with additional compound interest from two weeks following the Committee\u2019s Decision at an annual rate of 5 percent until complete payment.83\n\nSee Reply at para. 32.\n\nSee Rejoinder at para. 49(5).\n\n118.\n\nIn its Decision on Annulment, the Committee decided that each party would bear its own litigation costs and that the costs of the proceeding would be shared equally by each party.\n\n119.\n\nHowever, for this phase of the proceeding, the Committee considers that the Respondent should pay the costs of the proceeding. All of the Respondent\u2019s requests were rejected on the ground either that the Committee was not competent or that the questions had not been submitted to it. In addition, the Committee rejected the Respondent\u2019s request for a stay of enforcement of the unannulled portions of the Award. In these circumstances, the Committee finds it appropriate to order that the costs of the present phase of the proceeding should follow the event.\n\n120.\n\nThe Committee notes that other tribunals and committees have applied the same principle when requests for supplementation and/or rectification were rejected.84\n\nSee e.g., *Genin Supplementary and Rectification Decision* at para. 20; *Enron Rectification and Supplementary Decision* at para. 58.\n\n121.\n\nTherefore, the Committee orders the Republic to pay the ICSID costs incurred in connection with this phase of the Annulment Proceeding. In practical terms, the Committee notes that no further payment needs to be made by Chile since it has already made the advance payments. The ICSID Secretariat will refund any balance of the advance payments after disbursement of the costs.\n\n122.\n\nThis being said, the Committee does not find that Chile\u2019s Supplementation Request was frivolous or made in bad faith. Consequently, the Committee orders that each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n123.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee unanimously:\n\n1. Rejects the Request for Supplementation of the Decision on Annulment;\n\n2. Confirms that paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 of the *dispositif* as well as the body of the Award but for Section VIII are *res judicata.* Consequently, the Republic must pay compound interest at the annual rate of 5% on USD 3,045,627.78 from 8 May 2008 to 19 June 2013 and compound interest at the annual rate of 5% on the interest accrued as from 19 June 2013 until complete payment;\n\n3. Orders the Republic to pay the ICSID costs incurred in connection with this phase of the Annulment Proceeding; and\n\n4. Determines that each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this part of the Annulment Proceeding."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-09-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FREQUENTLY**  **USED**  **ABBREVIATIONS AND**  **ACRONYMS** | |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| CM | The Claimants' Memorial dated 27 June 2014 |\n| Exh.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Historical Context and Relevant Facts**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it useful to begin this Award with a brief summary of the factual and procedural background. In doing so, the Tribunal notes that the underlying dispute between the Parties goes back four decades, and has been pending before ICSID since 1997. It is therefore conscious of its duty to bring a final end to this long-running proceeding.\n\n2.\n\nMr V\u00edctor Pey Casado was born in Spain in 1915, moved to Chile at the age of 24 in 1939, and lived there for 34 years until 1973. Though he has retained Spanish nationality, he acquired Chilean nationality by naturalization in 1958. Ms Coral Pey Grebe, his daughter, was born in Chile on 27 December 1953, and holds Spanish nationality.1\n\nExh. ND-02, Spanish passport of Ms Coral Pey Grebe.\n\n3.\n\nMr Salvador Allende, elected President of Chile on 4 September 1970, was a friend of Mr Pey Casado.\n\n4.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Mr Pey Casado became associated with a Chilean newspaper, *El Clar\u00edn*. The newspaper had been founded by Messrs Dar\u00edo Sainte-Marie and Merino Liana, and was under the control of the company, *Consorcio Period\u00edstico y Publicitario*, S.A. (\"CPP\"), through a wholly owned subsidiary, *Empresa Period\u00edstica Clar\u00edn*, Ltda. (\"EPC\").\n\n5.\n\n*El Clar\u00edn* had a left-leaning political orientation and lent strong media support to the broadly socialist coalition led by President Allende.

Previous Phases of the Dispute and Procedural History**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nMr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende submitted a Request for Arbitration to ICSID on 7 November 1997, in reliance on the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Chile on the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments (\"BIT\") which had entered into force on 29 March 1994, Article 10 of which provides:\n\n1. Any dispute concerning investments, as defined in this Agreement, which arises between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, to the extent possible, be settled by means of friendly consultations between the two parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the time it was initiated by one of the Parties, it shall be submitted, at the discretion of the investor, to:\n\n- The national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute; or\n\n- International arbitration in the conditions described in paragraph 3.\n\nOnce the investor has submitted the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other procedure shall be final.\n\n3. If the dispute is submitted to international arbitration, it may be brought before one of the following arbitration bodies, at the discretion of the investor:\n\n- The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which was opened for signature in Washington, D.C., on 18 March 1965, when each State Party to this Agreement has acceded to it. As long as this condition remains unmet, each Contracting Party gives its consent to submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Additional Facility of ICSID;\n\n- An ad hoc court of arbitration established under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n4. The arbitration body shall take its decision on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement, of the law of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, including the rules relative to conflicts of laws, and of the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to investment, as well as of the principles of international law on the subject.\n\n5. The arbitral awards shall be final and binding for the parties to the dispute.\n\n6. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from dealing, through diplomatic channels, with matters concerning arbitration or judicial proceedings already under way until the relevant procedures have been completed, unless the parties to the dispute have not complied with the award of the court of arbitration or the decision of the ordinary court pursuant to the terms of compliance established in the award or decision.16\n\nThe Request was registered on 20 April 1998,17 and a Tribunal was constituted on 14 September 1998, which will be referred to in this Award as \"the First Tribunal\".\n\nExh.

Following a number of changes to the composition of the First Tribunal and the rejection of a request from the Respondent for new written submissions,27 a further hearing was held on 15-16 January 2007 in Paris.\n\nExh. R-121, Letter from Chile to the First Tribunal, 16 August 2006.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 May 2008, the First Tribunal issued its Award (\"the First Award\"), in which it decided, *inter alia* : 1) that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* was not covered *ratione temporis* by the substantive protections under the BIT;28 2) that the Respondent had committed two BIT violations distinct from the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* ;29 3) that the absence for seven years of a decision on the merits in the Goss press case amounted to a denial of justice, in violation of Article 4 of the BIT;30 and 4) the award of compensation under Decision No. 43 to other persons but not to Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation constituted discrimination contrary to the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4 of the BIT.31 The Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende $10,132,690.18 (plus compound interest) in damages for the violations found, and in addition $2,000,000 in legal fees and costs and $1,045,579.35 in procedural costs, but rejected all other claims submitted by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende.32\n\nExh.

Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende also requested the provisional suspension of the execution of the First Award.33\n\nExh. R-82, Claimants' Request for Revision of the Award, 2 June 2008.\n\n23.\n\nOn 24 July 2008, the Santiago court rendered its decision in relation to the Goss press case, in which it concluded that Mr Pey Casado did not have standing to sue, and that in any event his claim had become time barred.34 On 16 June 2009, a motion *ex parte* was filed by the Council for Defence of the State (\"CDE\") for the abandonment of the case,35 which was rejected by the Santiago court on 6 August 2009.36 On 12 August 2009, the CDE appealed against this decision,37 and on 18 December 2009, the Court of Appeal of Santiago declared the proceedings to have been abandoned.38\n\nExh.

An *ad hoc* Committee was constituted on 22 December 2009. On 4 May 2010, the *ad hoc* Committee issued a Decision rejecting Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende's request to declare inadmissible the application for annulment. On 15 October 2010, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende put forward a request of their own for partial annulment,40 which the *ad hoc* Committee rejected as plainly time-barred.\n\nExh.

Pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) and (e), decides to annul paragraph 4 of the *dispositif* of the Award of 8 May 2008 and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII);\n\n2. Rejects the other grounds of the Republic's Application for annulment;\n\n3. Rejects the Claimants' request for the partial annulment of paragraph 8 of the *dispositif* of the Award;\n\n4. Finds that paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 of the *dispositif* as well as the body of the Award but for Section VIII are *res judicata* ;\n\n5. Decides that there is no need to order the temporary stay of enforcement of the un-annulled portion of the Award.\n\n6. Decides that each party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding; and\n\n7. Decides that each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\n28.\n\nFollowing on from the above,47 Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende (\"the Claimants\") lodged on 18 June 2013, pursuant to Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention, a new Request for Arbitration (\"the New Request\"). The New Request was registered by the Centre on 8 July 2013. In accordance with the terms of Article 52(6), a new Tribunal was constituted on 24 December 2013 (\"the Tribunal\") composed of Sir Franklin Berman (President), appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, Mr Philippe Sands, appointed by the Claimants, and Mr Alexis Mourre, appointed by the Respondent. Following a challenge by the Respondent, Professor Sands informed the Centre by letter of 10 January 2014 that, while rejecting the grounds for the challenge, he took the view that the proper course was to allow the proceedings to continue without distraction, and accordingly relinquished his appointment as arbitrator. On 13 January 2014, following the resignation of Professor Sands, the ICSID Secretary-General notified the vacancy to the Parties and the proceeding was suspended pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(2). On the same date, the Tribunal consented to the resignation of Professor Sands pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), and on 31 January 2014 Mr V V Veeder was appointed to fill the vacant place on the Tribunal in accordance with Arbitration Rule 11(1) and the Tribunal was reconstituted on that date.

SUMMARY OF PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**A. Approach of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe account that follows of the Parties' arguments provides the essential background for the Tribunal's findings in the subsequent Sections of this Award. It is intended however as a summary only of the arguments both of fact and of law that the Tribunal has found to be of greatest relevance to the issues before it. At various times, accusations were put forward from both sides of bad faith or improper conduct on the other side. The Tribunal has not found these relevant to the issues before it and does not propose to consider them further. The Tribunal wishes to emphasize however that it has given full attention to all of the submissions put to it by the Parties both orally and in writing.\n\n**B. Overview of the Claimants' Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants' submissions can be divided into two broad categories. The first represents their opposition to the Respondent's jurisdictional arguments in respect of Ms Pey Grebe. The second category goes to determining the nature and quantum of the compensation due for the denial of justice and for the failure to accord fair and equitable treatment. The Claimants expressly disclaim any request for compensation under Article 5 of the ChileSpain BIT (expropriation), as foreclosed by the *res judicata* nature of the First Award in the light of the Decision on Annulment.48\n\nCR, paras. 214-215.\n\n**(1) Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*a.

They recall that the earlier assignment of rights from Mr Pey Casado to the Foundation Presidente Allende was confirmed by the *ad hoc* Committee, and should thus be considered *res judicata*.61 They contend that the Respondent's objections to Ms Pey Grebe's standing would deprive Mr Pey Casado of his rights under the First Award.62\n\nCR, paras. 39, 41.\n\nCR, para. 40.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the assignment of rights was valid under Spanish law and does not require authorization under Chilean law to be opposable to the Respondent,63 and that Chilean domestic law allows the assignment of rights relating to moral damages.64 The Respondent's objection to Ms Pey Grebe's standing is a repetition of an unsuccessful objection to the First Tribunal's jurisdiction, in respect of an assignment which used similar wording and was upheld in the First Award.65\n\nCR, paras. 42-45.\n\nCR, paras. 47-48.\n\nCR, paras. 50-52.\n\n*b.

The Claimants instead submit that paragraph 78 of the First Award demonstrates merely the awareness of the First Tribunal that to its knowledge, the validity of Decree No. 165 had never been put into question before the Chilean courts.100\n\nCR, paras. 201-204.\n\nCR, paras. 205-210.\n\n62.\n\nFinally, because the nullity of Decree No. 165 would have entailed its inexistence *ex tunc* and the invalidity also of the expropriation *de jure*, the Claimants argue that the expropriation *de facto* that had existed from 1973 would have continued until after the entry into force of the Chile-Spain BIT, and that the appropriate remedy to erase the effects of the denial of justice would not be to speculate as to what the First Tribunal would have concluded, but for the Tribunal to decide in the place of the First Tribunal.101 The Claimants further maintain that in the absence of the denial of justice, the First Tribunal would have made determinations with respect to the expropriation *de facto* of CPP and EPC; the Claimants maintain that this approach would not call into question the principle of *res judicata*, as it would serve to acknowledge the consequences of the withholding of evidence with respect to the denial of justice.102 The Claimants suggest that case law from the European Court of Human Rights supports the idea that a denial of justice can be constituted through the operation of a continuously unlawful act.103\n\nCR, paras. 210-1; see also CM, paras. 246-49.\n\nCM, paras. 299-300; CR, paras. 213-15, 218-21; Hearings, Day 4, pp. 49-50.\n\nCM, para. 302; Hearings, Day 1, pp. 52-3.\n\n(iii) The Claimants' objections with respect to the reliability of the testimony of the expert for the Respondent in relation to Decree No. 165\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants submit that expert for the Respondent, Dr Marcos Libedinsky, has already participated in two judicial pronouncements in the *Pey Casado v. El Fisc* case, even participating in the denial of justice against the Claimants, and thus demonstrating a lack of independence. The Claimants further submit that Dr Libedinsky, by applying the 1977 autoamnesty Decree so as to protect Chilean civil servants who had perpetrated international crimes, demonstrated the intention to uphold the impunity of the Respondent for its seizure of the Claimants' investment.104\n\nCR, paras. 82-86.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants suggest that Dr Libedinsky's expert report does not take into account the specificities of Decree-Laws No. 77 and 1726, the latter of which was confirmed as null by the Chilean Supreme Court. According to the Claimants, the nullity attaching to these two decrees, and any decrees made pursuant to them, differs from the administrative acts cited within his expert report as these are tainted with nullity *ipso jure*, the effects of which operate *ex tunc* and require no judicial intervention in order for the nullity to operate with full effect. The Claimants note that on 20 October 1999, Dr Libedinsky, then a judge on the Supreme Court, participated in a decision that made a general statement to the effect that if nullity operates *ipso jure*, it may be \u2018observed and declared indistinctly by a tribunal or administrative authority'.105\n\nCR, paras. 88-100. (Translated by the Tribunal)\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants observe that Dr Libedinsky's expert report cited three cases from appellate tribunals in Chile that did not concern the nullity of confiscatory decrees taken in pursuance of Government Decree No. 77 and Supreme Decree No. 1726; according to the Claimants, abundant case law exists that takes note of the nullity *ex tunc* of these decrees, and which also notes the imprescriptibility of actions in nullity under public law. The Claimants highlight a distinction between, on the one hand, the nullity of administrative or legislative acts, and on the other hand, civil or patrimonial actions which flow from the taking note of the nullity. They contend that, with respect to the former category, the passage of time can never cure nullity under public law.106\n\nCR, paras. 96-132.\n\n*c. The discontinuance proceedings are immaterial as regards the denial of justice*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the claimed discontinuance by Mr Pey Casado, or the purported eradication of the judgment of 24 July 2008 and of its case file from the records of the Santiago court by the Respondent, do not affect the denial of justice resulting from the absence of decision in the Goss press case, as consummated by the First Award of 8 May 2008.107 Though the Respondent has maintained that such discontinuance was purely for administrative ends, the Respondent in fact sought to paralyse the execution of the Santiago court's judgment.108\n\nCR, paras. 158-60.\n\nCM, paras. 290-293.\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the conditions for discontinuance prescribed under Article 152 of the Chilean Code of Civil Procedure, namely, that all parties must have ceased to participate for at least six months in a proceeding, and where the tribunal must also notify all concerned parties personally or by official act, have not been met in the present case.109 The abandonment of proceedings, in such cases, is a sanction that arises from the passivity, lack of interest or inactivity of a party, and does not arise in cases where it falls to a tribunal to take the next steps towards resolving the dispute. The Claimants accordingly submit that no abandonment could arise before the Santiago court, as the case before it was ready for decision, and Mr Pey Casado was merely awaiting notification.110\n\nCR, para. 166.\n\nCR, paras. 167-69.\n\n*d. The Respondent's acts subsequent to the First Award constitute a new denial of justice under the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in breach of the principles of a fair hearing and due process, the Respondent sought to erase from the record the judgment of 24 July 2008 so preventing the First Tribunal and the Claimants from being informed of the existence of that judgment, thus committing a new violation of Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT.111 Specifically, the Claimants point to a motion submitted by the Council for the Defence of the State to the Santiago court on 16 June 2009, which called for the proceeding to be declared abandoned so as to invalidate the judgment rendered.112 The motion was denied on 6 August 2009, on the grounds that Mr Pey Casado had not been notified of the judgment, at which point the CDE appealed *ex parte* to the Court of Appeal of Santiago, which on 18 December 2009 acceded to the CDE's request, again *ex parte*.113 The Claimants contend that, despite the annulment proceedings having been in train since 5 September 2008, at no point did the Respondent notify the Claimants that the Santiago court had given judgment on the merits in the Goss press case.114 The Claimants were only notified of the existence of the judgment on 31 January 2011.115\n\nCM, paras. 265, 271-72; CR, para. 172.\n\nCR, para. 173.\n\nCR, para. 174.\n\nCR, para. 175.\n\nCM, para. 265; see also Hearings, Day 1, p. 33, and Hearings, Day 4, p. 44.\n\n69.\n\nThese acts, taken together, constituted a further denial of justice and a new breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT, as they demonstrate a lack of good faith, and a breach of the obligation to maintain the existing position as far as possible for the duration of a dispute.116 The Claimants further contend that the decisions of the Chilean domestic courts, which have attempted to eradicate the Santiago court ruling, cannot produce legal effects on the international plane; and if they constitute a breach of international law, the principle of *restitutio in integrum* would apply to nullify their effects.117\n\nCM, para. 276; CR, paras. 176-184.\n\nCR, paras. 188-90.\n\n*e. Reparation for the damage resulting from the denial of justice*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, though Article 4 of the BIT does not specify that reparation becomes due in case of breach, they may rely on the \u2018most-favoured-nation' (MFN) clause embodied in Article 7, and give as an example the Chile-Australia BIT (Articles 6-7) to justify a claim for reparation.118\n\nCM, paras. 122-25.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants, recalling their argument that the consequence of concealing the ruling of the Santiago court was that the First Tribunal could not take note of the reality of the nullity of Decree No. 165, point to the fact that the objection based on extinctive prescription raised on 17 April 1996 by the CDE was not mentioned in paragraph 78 of the First Award.119 For the Claimants, this objection, upheld by the Santiago court, was only valid in relation to actions under the Chilean civil code, but was inapplicable before the First Tribunal.120\n\nCR, para. 226.\n\nCR, para. 227.\n\n72.\n\nUnder international law, the *dies a quo* for the prescription of a claim may be extended in cases where the claimant has sound reasons for failing to raise such claims, and has not been negligent.121 The Claimants recall that Mr Pey Casado fled Chile to seek asylum in Venezuela, was banned from Chile between 1973 and 1989, and was only able to recover the share certificates proving his ownership of CPP and EPC through a judicial decision of 29 May 1995, which was the *dies a quo*.122\n\nCR, paras. 228-229.\n\nCR, para. 231.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, because Mr Pey Casado filed an action for restitution of the Goss press on 4 October 1995, some four months after the *dies a quo*, the decision of the Santiago court\u2014which concluded that extinctive prescription had run pursuant to Articles 2226, 2227 and 2236 of the Chilean Civil Code\u2014is not opposable before the present Tribunal.123 The Claimants contend that reparation for the denial of justice which prevented them from putting forward claims after the entry into force of the BIT, should be calculated on the basis of the fair market value of CPP and EPC prior to their *de facto* confiscation.124\n\nCR, paras. 232-33.\n\nCM, paras. 372-79.\n\n74.\n\nWith respect to the moral injury suffered, the Claimants contend that during the seizure of CPP and EPC's assets in 1973, Mr Pey Casado's inclusion on a list of persons who needed to surrender immediately to the Ministry of National Defence, put him at serious risk of internment, torture, assassination or disappearance, which led him to seek asylum in Venezuela.125 The Claimants further contend that since 1973, Mr Pey Casado has been subjected to continuous humiliation, injustice and uncertainty owing to the Respondent's refusal to provide reparation.126\n\nCM, paras. 346-47, 506-7.\n\nCM, paras. 352-53.\n\n*f. The Respondent attempted to subvert the arbitral proceedings through fraud*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent's representatives have sought to frustrate the First Award in bad faith and to cause injury to the Claimants' investment, in further violation of Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT.127 The annulment of Section VIII and clause 4 of the *dispositif* of the First Award opens the possibility for the Tribunal to take full cognizance of the Respondent's conduct, both prior and subsequent to the First Award.128\n\nCR, para. 237.\n\nCR, paras. 238-39.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, beyond the moral injury caused at the moment of the seizure of CPP and EPC in 1973 and thereafter, Mr Pey Casado has been subject to defamation through measures taken by Chilean authorities;129 the reference to the Claimants as \u2018liars and impostors' in *El Pa\u00eds* on 23 June 1999, upon publication of Decision No. 43;130 insults to the Claimants and their counsel by the Chilean Ministry of National Assets;131 and the refusal by the Minister of the Interior to issue to Mr Pey Casado leave to enter in his capacity as a Spanish national, thus imposing on him Chilean nationality *de facto*.132 The Claimants submit that because of the element of intentional misconduct that is inherent in fraud, arbitral tribunals may find indirect or circumstantial evidence of fraud to be sufficient.133\n\nCM, paras. 356-59, 508, including, *inter alia*, the deletion of the reference on the Civil Registry of Mr Pey Casado as an \u2018alien' on 24 June 1999: see CM, para. 359, and Hearings, Day 1, p. 25.\n\nCM, paras. 363, 509.\n\nCM, paras. 363, 509.\n\nCM, para. 366.\n\nHearings, Day 1, pp. 81-82.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent introduced into the case file of the First Tribunal a gravely misleading translation of Mr Pey Casado's *Demande* of 1995 which would have altered the *causa petendi* by omitting the claim that Decree No. 165 was null *ex tunc*, and by mistranslating a term in such a way that it was read to refer to the building where the Goss press was located, rather than to the press itself.134 The Claimants maintain that these mistranslations were repeated exactly in the judgment of the Santiago court of 24 July 2008,135 and that, in relation to Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000, the Respondent falsely argued that ownership of the Goss press was attributed to EPC, rather than to CPP.136\n\nCR, paras. 250-252, 258-59.\n\nCR, para. 254.\n\nCR, paras. 255-257.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the submissions of the Respondent before the First Tribunal were fraudulent in relation to the nullity *ex tunc* of Decree No. 165, as the Respondent was aware of Mr Pey Casado's request for restitution of the Goss press, and yet paralysed the progress of the proceeding before the Santiago court until the First Award had been rendered and attributed the ownership of CPP and EPC to third parties through Decision No. 43. This paralysis was particularly evident given the Respondent's argument that the First Tribunal lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* after Decree No. 165 was issued in 1975, and amounted to a wilful misconstrual of the framework in which the First Tribunal was to consider the Claimants' claims.137\n\nCR, paras. 260-268.\n\n*g. The Respondent's deceptive conduct persisted throughout the Revision Proceeding, the Annulment Proceeding and the present Resubmission Proceeding*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent and its representatives deliberately withheld knowledge of the Santiago court judgment throughout the Revision Proceeding in which the continued absence of decision from the Santiago court figured prominently. The Claimants point to the Respondent's Response of 1 October 2008,138 in which the Respondent rejected submissions as to the effects of the nullity under public law of Decree No. 165. The Claimants maintain that the fraudulent concealment of the domestic court judgment by the Respondent constituted a denial of justice, as it prevented them from submitting a request for annulment under Article 52, paragraph 2, of the ICSID Convention.139\n\nExh.

The Claimants submit that from 22 May 2014, representatives of the Respondent successfully managed to unarchive the original case file in the Santiago court, and resorted to measures to conceal the file from the Claimants throughout 2014 through false pretences *.*140 The Claimants allege that the Santiago court repeatedly ignored or refused Mr Pey Casado's requests for access in order to prevent the Claimants from demonstrating coordination between the Santiago court and agents for the Respondent in the present Resubmission Proceeding.141 The Claimants further complain that the Respondent has actively denied them access to the Goss file at the Santiago court.142\n\nCR, paras. 281-82.\n\nCR, paras. 283-286.\n\nLetter from the Claimants to the Tribunal dated 20 February 2015.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, taken as a whole, the Respondent's fraudulent conduct and bad faith amounts to a further violation of Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT, as, for this reason, the First Tribunal could not properly establish the *quantum* of damages because of the presumption that the Respondent still had title over the investment.143\n\nCR, para. 291.\n\n**(3) The Claimants' submissions on the injury resulting from the violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment resulting from DecisionNo. 43**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a.

The Claimants contend that the Respondent's paralysis of their claims in domestic proceedings was such that they had no choice but to turn to international arbitration, and that Law No. 19,568 was not the exclusive source of their right to compensation.149 They point to the optional character of Law No. 19,568, which provides in its Article 1, paragraph 6, for alternative proceedings, for example for restitution or compensation under Article 7 of the Chilean Constitution.150 The Claimants also contend that, through Decision No. 43, the Respondent exhausted its obligation under Law No. 19,568, thus precluding the Claimants from being able to seek compensation, as the Respondent could not be forced to compensate twice for an asset.151\n\nCR, paras. 319-20.\n\nCR, paras. 321-323; Hearings, Day 4, pp. 53-4.\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 36-7.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants invoke various provisions of Chilean domestic law, including Articles 10 and 18 of the Constitution which entrench the right to property and the obligation to pay compensation for the deprivation of property;152 Articles 2314 and 2329 of the Civil Code likewise provide for an obligation to pay reparation for injury caused by administrative acts;153 and Article 1556 of the Civil Code, stipulates that compensation for injuries comprises both *lucrum cessans* and *damnum emergens*.154 The Claimants assert that these provisions of domestic law also grant them a right to *restitutio in integrum*, irrespective of any specific protections in place at the time of the seizure.155\n\nCR, para. 323.\n\nCM, paras. 127-29; CR, para. 325.\n\nCR, paras. 326-27.\n\nHearings, Day 1, pp. 107-8.\n\n(4) **The** ***quantum*** **of damages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*a.

see also CM, paras. 380-81.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the appropriate standard to be used in calculating damages in the present proceedings is one based in international law, and not the law of the host State; therefore Law No. 19,568 and the value paid to investors under it would not be relevant for the calculation of damages here.167 They reject the Respondent's contentions on the burden of proof for establishing damages, pointing out that paragraph 689 of the First Award, which deals with the burden of proof in establishing damages, was annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee.168\n\nCR, paras. 363-4.\n\nHearings, Day 4, p. 21.\n\n(ii) The injury suffered by reason of the violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nCiting the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case,169 the Claimants submit that compensation is due for the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn* as, but for the discrimination suffered, they would have received reparation for the confiscation of the assets of CPP and EPC.170 They contend that they should be placed in the situation in which they would have been but for the commission of the internationally wrongful act.171 The Claimants also suggest that the Tribunal enjoys the discretionary power to determine which standard of reparation is the most appropriate.172 They further contend that under ICSID case law, compensation can also be calculated on fair market value for BIT violations not constituting expropriation.173 Finally, they reject the Respondent's contention that no harm resulted from the discrimination, on the ground that to do so questions the very existence of the violation, which is *res judicata*.174\n\nExh.

Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award of 27 May 2007, para. 382; CR, para. 368.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants rebut the Respondent's argument that a claim for unjust enrichment represents a new claim, as it represents only a basis for the calculation of damages once liability has been established;182 moreover, new evidence may be introduced if it is for the sole purpose of calculating damages to be awarded.183\n\nCR, para. 370.\n\nCR, para. 372; *Amco v.

The Accuracy expert report*\n-------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the figures presented by Accuracy are pertinent and accurate, and take into account the differences between *El Clar\u00edn* and the chosen comparators, in particular through the use of the 20% discount.189 The Claimants further contend that the facts subsequent to the critical date of 10 September 1973 are not relevant in the present case, as the objective of a comparative approach is to determine what the reasonable and well-informed businessman would have been prepared to pay on the critical date, using knowledge available at the time.190\n\nCR, paras. 450-52.\n\nCR, paras. 455-457; see also CM, paras. 386-90.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants recall that Accuracy considered that the analogical method was the most reliable method to establish the fair market value of CPP and EPC, and accordingly to substantiate an expropriation-based calculation of damages. They submit that the \u2018Discounted Cash Flow method' (\u2018DCF') cannot be used in cases where there was insufficient financial information, and that, owing to the Respondent's systematic refusal to produce the financial documents sought by the Claimants, it would not have been possible to use this method.191 Accuracy states that the method of assessment using fair market value is not expropriation-based, but applicable to a wider range of assessments.192 The Claimants further contend that in any event, the *ad hoc* Committee annulled Section VIII of the First Award, in which the First Tribunal rejected the use of expropriation-based damages, and therefore there would be no violation of *res judicata* in calculating compensation based on fair market value.193\n\nCM, para. 454; see also Hearings, Day 1, p. 114; and Hearings, Day 3, pp. 16-17.\n\nHearings, Day 3, p. 15.\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 61-62.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants submit that in calculating the compensation due for the expropriation of CPP, the price paid by Mr Pey Casado cannot be relevant, as fair market value is an abstract concept that does not take into account the particularities of a given situation.194 They point to the fact that the price paid by Mr Pey Casado to Mr Sainte-Marie reflected the \u2018fair value', but not the \u2018fair market value', of CPP and EPC, as it reflected the specific positions of the two parties to the transaction, who were friends and long-standing colleagues, rather than the fair market value of the assets sold.195\n\nCR, para. 464; see also CM, paras. 383-86.\n\nCR, paras. 465-69.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants defend the use by Accuracy of the US dollar in its calculations, on the basis that a prudent investor at that time would have used that currency, and that any differences in inflation between the US and Chile would have been counter-balanced by changes in the exchange rates between the two currencies. The exchange rate used by Accuracy was the average annual exchange rate published by the Bank of Chile, which corresponds to the rate that would have been applied to businessmen seeking to purchase United States dollars during that period.196 With respect to the capitalization rates used, the Claimants defend Accuracy's choice of the mid-rate of American ten-year Treasury Bonds, augmented by a national risk premium of 2% corresponding to the rate assigned to Chile from 1974 to 2000 and subjected to annual review from 2000-2014.197\n\nCM, para. 457.\n\nCM, para. 459.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the expert report submitted by Navigant in support of the Respondent's claim is based on an incorrect interpretation of the dispute as directed by the Respondent, and that Navigant's entire report is outside its field of expertise, being based on a legal analysis of the consequences of a treaty violation and not on financial matters.198\n\nCR, paras. 423-424.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants suggest that Accuracy's damages assessment should be used by the Tribunal as Navigant, the Respondent's expert, has not proposed an alternative damages assessment,199 and because the Respondent has failed to produce the documents requested by the Claimants in their March and November 2014 requests for document production.200 The expert reports of Accuracy are reliable and trustworthy, even if a measure of uncertainty is present in the calculations, as there exists an inherent uncertainty in damages calculations, and the Tribunal possesses the discretion to make an approximate calculation as to the amount recoverable.201\n\nCR, para. 427.\n\nCR, paras. 436-38.\n\nCR, paras. 429-32.\n\n105.\n\nMoreover, given the particularly violent character of the expropriation in the present case, and the inability of the Claimants to obtain key information from the Respondent, Accuracy was only able to obtain incomplete information relating to its calculations. The Tribunal should give the Claimants the benefit of the doubt and consider the value range submitted by Accuracy.202\n\nCR, paras. 435-38 and 441-44.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the EBITDA adjustment undertaken by Accuracy, which aims to establish the fair market value of the companies concerned, used a number of comparators from the American press sector: a high average of 12 x EBITDA, which excludes the New York Times and the Washington Post, and a low average of 9.9 x EBITDA, which includes them; the period under study is from 1988-2013, including a particular emphasis on the transactions of these comparator companies from 2000-2013.203 The Claimants recommend that the high average of 12x be retained, arguing that the New York Times and Washington Post present a notably different corporate profile of activity.204 Accuracy have also applied a 20% discount (*d\u00e9cote*) by reason of the absence of similar data for the press sector in Latin America, and using a range of multiples in line with the practice of other forecasters; after the discount, the 12x multiple would be converted to 9.6 x EBITDA.205 They reject the Respondent's contention that the New York Times and the Washington Post should not have been excluded, as these two comparators are the least close to the situation of *El Clar\u00edn*.206 The Claimants contend that the EBITDA adjustment has been confirmed in the First Award and has the character of *res judicata*, and that the Respondent's objections to this adjustment are unfounded.207\n\nCM, para. 472 *bis* (419).\n\nCM, para. 473.\n\nCM, paras. 463, 474-476; see also Hearings, Day 3, pp. 22-23.\n\nCR, paras. 459-461.\n\nCR, para. 445-449.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants explain that Accuracy analysed the financial data of the seized companies prior to their seizure from 1970 to 1972, so as to determine the profitability of the operational activity of the group.208 Accuracy has concluded that the aggregate value (normalized EBITDA value) of the Group *El Clar\u00edn* was, in 1972, either US$738,000 or US$1,222,000.209 The Claimants contend that two figures were necessary given the claimed concealment by the Respondent of figures relating to 1973, and that the higher figure should be preferred.210 Taking into consideration the *El Clar\u00edn* Group's debt of US$535,000, the Claimants calculate that, according to the normalized EBITDA value of (US$1,222,000 -US$535,000), the value of the shares in CPP and EPC on the eve of their seizure *de facto* was US$11,200,000.211\n\nCM, paras. 465-67.\n\nCM, paras. 468-69.\n\nCM, paras. 470-71.\n\nCM, para. 480.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the material injury to the Claimants must be capitalized up to the date of the First Award, 8 May 2008, after which compound interest should apply until the date of payment.212 Capitalization should be at the rate of American 10-year Treasury bonds augmented by the risk premium pertaining to Chile, namely, fixed at 2% from 19731999 and revised each year from 2000-2008.213 From 8 May 2008 until 27 June 2014, compound interest of 5% has been applied.214 The injury suffered by the Claimants, valued on 27 June 2014, is thus US$329,700,000.\n\nCM, para. 481;

Tax gross-up*\n-----------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants contend that any compensation must take into account the difference between the tax rate that would be paid at the time of any eventual award, and the tax rate applicable on the capital gains that would have been paid had compensation been awarded in 1973.233 They thus request a tax gross-up on the damages awarded, so as to restore fully to them their patrimony had there been no violation of fair and equitable treatment.234 They calculate that the tax gross-up should be between US$10 and 13 million (Accurracy's Approach A), or between US$18 and 22 million (Accurracy's Approach B) for the principal claim, and more than US$6 million for the ancillary claim.235\n\nCR, paras. 489-91, citing to Second Accuracy Report, para. 31.\n\nCR, para. 492.\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 15-16.\n\n117.\n\nDuring the oral proceedings, the Claimants sought to introduce into the record new tax calculations, with respect to the rates of taxation applicable in Chile in 2015, on the basis that these were a simple update of document CM-48.236 The Respondent objected to the introduction of this new documentation, on the basis that these constituted an entirely new document that they have not had the opportunity to assess, rebut, or show to experts.237 By email dated 16 May 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would \"rule on the Claimants' request as and when it reaches the point of deciding on the relevance of tax rate schedules to its Award.\"\n\nHearings, Day 2, pp. 166-167, and Hearings, Day 3, p. 7.\n\nHearings, Day 3, pp. 3-5, 10.\n\n*e.

By letter of 22 April 2015, the Claimants took note of the fact that the Respondent had paid this sum, and in a written communication addressed to the Parties of 16 May 2015, the Tribunal took note of the Claimants' abandonment of their claim for that specific sum.\n\nCR, para. 409.\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants' full request for costs totals \u20ac 11,156,739.44 and US$517,533.249 With respect to costs and fees relating specifically to the Resubmission Proceeding, the Claimants submitted figures of US$4,534,826.60 and \u20ac33,332.19 in legal costs and translation costs.250\n\nCR, para. 412.\n\nSee letter dated 29 May 2015 from the Claimants to the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Overview of the Respondent's Submissions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent's submissions can be divided into three broad sections: challenges to the standing of Ms Pey Grebe, and to the admissibility of the Claimants' requests for relief; challenges to the Claimants' theory of damages, and in particular, the damages calculations presented by their expert; and challenges to the Claimants' requests for a tax gross-up, interest, and costs and fees.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent's principal submission in response to the Claimants' submission is that \u2018each and every one of the Claimants' requests for relief' exceeds the Tribunal's authority to award relief in the present proceedings,251 as they contravene the two fundamental principles that characterize ICSID resubmission proceedings: first, the parties must be in complete identity with those that participated in both the original arbitration that yielded the award and the annulment proceeding that vacated the award in full or in part; and secondly, the parties and the resubmission tribunal remain bound by the un-annulled portions of the award, with the competence of the resubmission tribunal confined to deciding issues raised in the annulled portion(s) of the First Award.252\n\nRR, para. 14.\n\nRR, para. 15.\n\n**(1) Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*a. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Ms Pey Grebe and her claims*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Claimants' decision to substitute Ms Coral Pey Grebe for Mr Pey as Claimant generates three specific jurisdictional problems. The Respondent suggests instead that Mr Pey Casado be reinstated as Claimant in the proceeding, in lieu of Ms Pey Grebe, and that, in the light of Mr Pey Casado's advanced age, Ms Pey Grebe be regarded as her father's representative.253\n\nRCM, para. 195.\n\n126.\n\nIn the Respondent's contention Ms Pey Grebe is not a proper party to the Resubmission Proceeding, since Article 52 of the ICSID Convention provides that only the same \u2018parties' who participated in both the arbitration and the annulment proceedings are entitled to seek resubmission of a dispute following the full or partial annulment of an award.254 The Respondent argues that because the First Award did not make any jurisdictional findings on claims of Ms Pey Grebe, she lacks standing to assert rights on the basis of the First Award's findings, as ICSID rules do not allow for representative claims.255\n\nRCM, para. 179; RR, para. 18.\n\nRCM, paras. 181-183.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Ms Pey Grebe as she does not have a qualifying \u2018investment'. Investors must not only hold some type of protected asset, but the asset must, under Article 1(2) of the BIT,256 have been obtained as a result of a personal contribution; the cession from Mr Pey Casado to his daughter does not qualify, as it was made without consideration (*\u00e0 titre gratuit*). Moreover, the object of the cession is precisely what the First Award found to have been expropriated definitively during the 1970s.257\n\nWhich expressly limits protection to claims, securities and rights \u2018arising from all types of contributions made for the purpose of creating economic value'.\n\nRCM, paras. 186-189.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that jurisdiction has not been, and in all likelihood cannot be, established with respect to Ms Pey Grebe, as Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention prohibits claims by dual nationals if one of the nationalities is that of the respondent State; the Claimants have not denied that Ms Pey Grebe is a dual Spanish-Chilean national, was born in Chile, and continues to bear Chilean nationality.258\n\nRCM, paras. 191-92; RR, para. 19.\n\n129.\n\nFinally, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal is not empowered to award relief to Ms Pey Grebe for an injury sustained by another party, in particular those which by their nature are *in personam*, or for an injury occurring prior to her claimed investment.259 Because Ms Pey Grebe was not a party to the Chilean court proceeding that was the subject of the finding of a denial of justice in the First Award, the Respondent concludes that Ms Pey Grebe cannot recover any damages for that finding. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that even if the violations of the BIT found in the First Award relate only to the investment and not to the investor as such, Ms Pey Grebe cannot recover for harm caused before her claimed acquisition of the investment in March 2013.260\n\nRR, para. 29.\n\nRCM, paras. 193-194.\n\n130.\n\nAs to the more specific arguments made by the Claimants in support of Ms Pey Grebe's status as Claimant in the Resubmission Proceedings: (a) although it is right that jurisdiction is to be established at the moment that proceedings are instituted, the Respondent submits that if a new claimant joins the case, the Tribunal must evaluate its jurisdiction anew as to each such claimant; (b) the assignment of Mr Pey Casado's shares in *El Clar\u00edn* and rights in this arbitration does not suffice to establish Ms Pey Grebe's standing, because the requirement of the identity of the parties is not satisfied merely by virtue of a transfer of rights; (c) although the Claimants contend that the assignment constitutes a valid legal agreement that must be respected by the Tribunal, to uphold the Claimant's argument would be to permit a private agreement to supersede the limitations on jurisdiction imposed by the ICSID Convention; (d) the Respondent denies that it is merely repeating its earlier objection to the First Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Foundation, since the situation of Ms Pey Grebe has to be distinguished on the grounds set out above; (e) the Respondent denies that it is precluded from raising jurisdictional objections in the Counter-Memorial, as ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) allows a party to identify jurisdictional deficiencies until \u2018the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial'; no ICSID tribunal has ever refused to examine jurisdictional deficiencies identified in a respondent's countermemorial, but the Tribunal must in any event evaluate *sua sponte* any jurisdictional defects posed by Ms Pey Grebe's role as Claimant; (f) finally, the Respondent denies that its objections are designed to deprive Mr Pey Casado of the benefits of the First Award, since the problems arise out of the Claimants' own unwillingness to reinstate Mr Pey Casado as Claimant.261\n\nRR, paras. 22-32; see also Hearings, Day 2, pp. 3-4.\n\n*b. The damage calculations offered by the Claimants and their expert are inadmissible, as they do not relate specifically to the two BIT violations identified in the First Award*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that Procedural Order No. 1 identifies the scope of the Tribunal's authority as the matters identified in paragraph 359.1 of the Decision on Annulment, and submits that all the Claimants' requests for relief, in particular those relating to claimed postFirst Award violations of Article 4 of the BIT, exceed the Tribunal's authority, as they either represent a variety of new claims or revisit prior failed claims.262 The Respondent rejects in particular the following: the freestanding expropriation claim; the claim that various post First Award events relating to the Goss press constitute a violation of Article 4 of the BIT; the claim that the behaviour of its representatives amounts to a new violation of Article 4 of the BIT; the claim that national treatment was denied to the Claimants when the owners of most other media companies were compensated for the expropriation of their assets; and the claim based on unjust enrichment.263\n\nRR, para. 37; RCM, paras. 240-42.\n\nRR, paras. 39-40.\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' requests for relief are improper because they are inconsistent with the nature and scope of the Resubmission Proceeding, and directly contradict prior decisions which are *res judicata*.264 The Respondent points, in particular, to the three requests corresponding to the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*, the requests for costs and legal fees that were declined by the First Tribunal and *ad hoc* Committee, and the request for moral damages;265 all of these are insufficiently connected to the two violations of the BIT that fall within the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding, and in any event Chile has already paid some of these costs and fees.266 The Respondent further contends that, because paragraph 3 of the First Award's *dispositif* was not annulled and remains binding, it precludes the Tribunal from ordering restitution or satisfaction; accordingly, it may not consider any claims for unjust enrichment or moral damages, as these are not requests for compensation, compensation being understood as financially assessable damages.267\n\nRCM, para. 172.\n\nRR, paras. 41-42; see also Hearings, Day 2, p. 79.\n\nRR, para. 43; see also Hearings, Day 2, p. 83.\n\nRCM, paras. 224-27, 250-1, 331; Hearings, Day 4, pp. 96-97.\n\n*c. The claims based on expropriation value contradict unannulled portions of the First Award and are outside the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nWith respect to the requests corresponding to the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn,* the Respondent submits that un-annulled portions of the First Award preclude any assessment of damages that equates injury from the BIT violations with the injury from the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*. The Respondent submits that the un-annulled portions of the First Award declare that none of the BIT's substantive protections applied to the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*, and that the two BIT violations are distinct from any expropriation-based violation.268 Liability for a breach being a prerequisite for an award of damages as compensation, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants' request would entail it being obliged to pay damages for a BIT violation not found by the First Tribunal.269\n\nRCM, para. 229; RR, paras. 48-50; see also Hearings, Day 1, pp. 165-66.\n\nRCM, paras. 230 and 232; RR, paras. 51-52; see also Hearings, Day 2, pp. 42-44.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent denies that any unjust enrichment gained by it can be awarded by the Tribunal, primarily because, whether or not unjust enrichment was argued before the First Tribunal but not considered in the First Award, the First Tribunal \u2018unambiguously concluded' that none of the BIT's substantive protections could apply either to the taking of control over the assets of *El Clar\u00edn*, or to the depriving of the Claimants of the benefits of them.270 The Respondent therefore submits that to grant any compensation for unjust enrichment would be \u2018completely arbitrary, inconsistent with binding conclusions from the Award, contrary to the Annulment Decision's clear and explicit guidance on the issues and findings that had been annulled... and at odds with the... tenet of international law that a State can be condemned to pay damages for particular conduct only if there has been a finding of liability for such conduct'.271\n\nRCM, para. 237, citing to First Award, paras. 429, 466, 608, 610.\n\nRR, para. 54; see also RCM, para. 238.\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent submits in the alternative that even if the First Award had failed to address a claim for unjust enrichment*,* the appropriate proceeding would have been the filing of a request for supplementation pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, but subject to a fixed time limit of 45 days after the date on which an award is rendered; having failed to observe that, the Claimants must now be deemed to have waived their rights to make such a claim.272\n\nRCM, para. 239.\n\n*d. The Claimants' request for costs incurred in prior phases of the dispute is impermissible*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' request for costs incurred in prior phases of the dispute is outside the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding. The Respondent also contends that the Tribunal cannot entertain costs claims relating to violations of Article 3 of the BIT and of Articles 53(1) and 54(1) of the ICSID Convention, as it has not been found in breach of these provisions by any ICSID panel.273 As to claims for prior costs linked to the violation of Article 4 of the BIT, the Respondent maintains that these must be rejected in the present Resubmission Proceeding, as the First Tribunal, the Revision Tribunal, the *ad hoc* Committee, and the Spanish court in the enforcement proceeding in Spain had already ruled on the Claimants' costs requests in the context of each proceeding.274 Finally, the Respondent notes that it has already paid the cost amounts owed to the Claimants pursuant to the cost awards in the First Award and Supplementation Decision of 19 June 2013.275 The sum of US$2,634.83 noted by the Claimants as missing is due to a commission that the Claimants' bank had deducted from the amount transferred by Chile.276\n\nRR, para. 57.\n\nRR, paras. 58, 123-24; Hearings, Day 2, p. 83; Hearings, Day 4, pp. 108-09.

R-169, Letter from the Claimants to the Annulment Committee, 8 October 2013.\n\nRR, para. 60.\n\n*e. The Claimants' claim for moral damages is improper*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it would be impermissible to award moral damages, whether for the seizure of *El Clar\u00edn* or in compensation for any claimed misconduct on its part during the arbitration proceedings, on the basis that neither of them relates to the two BIT violations found in the First Award; it recalls in particular that the First Tribunal expressly rejected the Claimants' submissions concerning any misconduct during the arbitration proceedings. The Respondent contends that the Claimants are only entitled to compensation for the BIT violations, and then only to compensation which corresponds to \u2018financially assessable damage'; by contrast, moral damages cannot be quantified, so that the Claimants' request for US$10.5 million in moral damages is arbitrary. Even if the Tribunal were authorized to award moral damages, it could still not do so for the benefit of Ms Pey Grebe or to the Foundation for injuries suffered by Mr Pey Casado *,* as the ICSID system only allows for claims for losses suffered personally, and the interests of Ms Pey Grebe and the Foundation were not acquired until 2013 and 1990 respectively, thus much later than when the purported injuries were sustained.277\n\nRCM, paras. 333-337; RR, paras. 62-66.\n\n*f. The Claimants have failed to satisfy their burden of proving their damages, and thus are entitled to no compensation*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, inasmuch as the Claimants have failed to identify any relief that can be granted by the Tribunal, no compensation can be awarded. The Claimants have instead claimed for the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*, which is excluded by the unannulled conclusions of the First Award, and have neglected to advance any damages calculations or theories with respect to the BIT violations upheld by the First Award.278 The Respondent takes the view that even if a BIT violation is found to exist, a tribunal may decline to award any damages to a claimant if the claimant fails to meet its burden of proving them.279\n\nRR, paras. 68-78, 146; RCM, paras. 244-48, 281, 293; Hearings, Day 2, pp. 86-88; Hearings, Day 4, p. 121.\n\nHearings, Day 2, pp. 91-93.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimants' brought the harm on themselves by their own actions, by knowingly and voluntarily declining to participate in the relevant Chilean reparations process established by Law No. 19,568, instead opting to pursue their expropriation claims in an international forum, which, through the \u2018fork-in-the-road' clause in the Chile-Spain BIT, made it impossible for the Respondent to compensate them under Chilean law for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*.280\n\nRCM, para. 282; RR, para. 79, both citing Exh. R-1, letter from J. Garc\u00e9s to the Chilean Minister of National Assets of 24 June 1999, pp. 3-4. See also Hearings, Day 2, pp. 33-4, and Hearings, Day 4, pp. 76-77.\n\n**(2) Merits: calculating the** ***quantum*** **of damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a. All the Claimants' arguments on damages are ill-founded*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent disputes all of the Claimants' arguments on damages, on the basis that they are irrelevant to the Resubmission Proceeding and exceed its scope. They create the risk of a contradiction between the First Award and the present Tribunal's Award, or would represent a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Respondent recalls its earlier submission that there is no causal link between the denial of justice and discrimination violations and the ability of the Claimants to obtain compensation for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*, but that it was the Claimants' own decision to eschew Chilean legal mechanisms in favour of an international claim.281\n\nRR, paras. 82-92.\n\n*b. The Claimants' theory of damages for the denial of justice violation is untenable*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, despite bearing the burden of proving causation, quantum and the recoverability of the loss claimed by the denial of justice violation, the Claimants have not presented any damages calculation that relates specifically to it, but instead, have presented a theory of damages that has already been rejected by the First Tribunal.282\n\nRCM, paras. 312-15.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the First Tribunal confined the denial of justice purely to the absence of a decision on the merits in the Goss press case between September 1994 and 4 November 2002, and not the underlying issue relating to the confiscation itself;283 to accept the Claimants' \u2018continuing expropriation' theory of compensation would, however, be to rule upon the substance of the confiscation claim, and to overturn or contradict the unannulled conclusions in the First Award.284 The Respondent also contends that the denial of justice is limited only to the absence of decision by the Chilean tribunals for more than seven years, and not to any other conduct by them;285 the only effect of the seven-year delay is that that court would have ruled earlier, but still against Mr Pey Casado, and in any event the Santiago court could not possibly have granted Mr Pey Casado the full expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*, as he was only asking for the value of the Goss printing press.286\n\nRCM, paras. 206, 316; see also Hearings, Day 1, p. 179.\n\nRCM, paras. 208-9, 317.\n\nHearings, Day 2, pp. 17-19; Hearings, Day 4, pp. 99-100.\n\nHearings, Day 2, p. 55; see also Hearings, Day 2, pp. 98-99.\n\n143.\n\nMoreover, to substantiate their claim the Claimants would have had to prove that the denial of justice had prevented the First Tribunal from awarding compensation to the Claimants in the amount of the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*, yet this is in fact the very portion of the First Award that was annulled.287 However, the First Tribunal based its conclusion purely on its determination that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* was an instantaneous act, and the status of Decree No. 165 under Chilean law had no bearing on the issue of when the expropriation was consummated *.*288 Accordingly, the First Tribunal's reference to Decree No. 165 concerned its timing, and had no bearing on the legal status or validity of that document.289\n\nRR, para. 95.\n\nRCM, paras. 198, 209-210; RR, para. 99; see also Hearings, Day 2, pp. 53, 58-59.\n\nRCM, para. 199; RR, para. 100.\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent argues, relying on the two Expert Reports of Dr Libedinsky, that it is a requirement of Chilean domestic law that \u2018nullity under public law must be expressly and formally stated by a competent judicial or administrative authority'.290 However, Mr Pey Casado had never asked for the annulment of Decree No. 165 before the Santiago court, and there is no express declaration in its judgment that Decree No. 165 is rendered null and void.291 The Respondent further denies that the Santiago court ruling's conclusion that only EPC, and not Mr Pey Casado, had standing to assert its property rights in that case, could be construed to constitute recognition that Decree No. 165 is null under public law. Instead, the Respondent contends that Mr Pey Casado's claim was rejected purely on the basis that he lacked standing on the face of his own complaint, which was one for restitution of property belonging to a third party, and because the relevant five-year statute of limitations had run even before the claim was filed in 1995; there would accordingly have been no difference in the outcome of the case had the Santiago court issued its merits ruling earlier.292 The Respondent concludes that Decree No. 165 remains in force under the Chilean legal system;293 in the alternative, even if null, the validity of Decree No. 165 had no impact on the effects of that expropriation under international law, which cannot be undone retroactively.294\n\nRCM, para. 215, and RR, para. 107.

The Respondent reiterates that under Arbitration Rule 55(3), the present Tribunal cannot revisit any of the un-annulled passages of the First Award, which are *res judicata.*296\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 121-26.(Di Rosa)). Law No. 19,568 may be found at Exh. R-147;RR, para. 113.\n\nRR, paras. 114, 118.\n\n146.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, under Article 2.2. of the BIT, an investment may have been made prior to its entry into force, but must still be existing at the time of the entry into force; if the investment has already disappeared, it cannot be covered by the BIT.297\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 87-91.\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent argues that new evidence, e.g. in the form of the Santiago court ruling, allows for the reopening of an Award only in the context of a revision proceeding pursuant to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, but not that of a resubmission proceeding under Article 52.298\n\nRR, para 116, contending that at CR, para. 162, the Claimants acknowledge this fact.\n\n148.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the acts and omissions now complained of by the Claimants fall outside the temporal and substantive scope of the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal, which extends from 1995 and ended in 2002.299 In response to the allegations centring on the translation of the 2008 judgment of the Santiago court, the Respondent points to the original version of the document where there was a stamp over the three missing words, and suggests that this was the reason for the omission, not fraud.300 The Respondent further argues that the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal included only the conduct of Chilean domestic courts, and excluded any alleged misconduct by Chile's executive authorities in the prior phases of the present dispute.301\n\nRR, para. 119, citing to Award, para. 659.\n\nHearings, Day 2, pp. 81-82.\n\nRR, para. 120, citing to Award, para. 659; see also Hearings, Day 2, pp. 19-20.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the claim for restitution for the Goss press was dealt with in the Claimants' Ancillary Request of 2002, and that the finding that none of the substantive provisions of the Chile-Spain BIT applied to any of the expropriation-related claims, also encompasses claims relating to the Goss press, and is *res judicata*.302\n\nRR, para. 125, citing to Award, para. 600; Hearings, Day 4, pp. 109-10.\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimants have neglected to provide any evidence or argument to identify the compensation that was due for the denial of justice resulting from the seven-year delay in the Santiago court proceeding, and that in any event the delay did not cause any compensable injury to the Claimants, as they would not have received compensation for the restitution value of the Goss press or for the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn* had there been no delay.303 The Respondent rejects the allegation that it had denied access to the Goss press case file at the Santiago court, in view of the evidence it has submitted that the Claimants only requested access to a small handful of pages from the case file, which they received.304\n\nRR, para. 127, citing to Exh. ND32f, Decision of the First Civil Court of Santiago, p. 10.\n\nRR, para. 130, citing to Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal, 13 February 2015, p. 3.\n\n*c. The Claimants' theory of damages for the discrimination violation is unfounded*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' theory of damages for the discrimination violation encounters the identical objections to the theory put forward for the denial of justice; in both cases, the compensation demanded is for the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*.305 The Respondent accordingly submits that because the Claimants have not identified any injury caused by the discrimination, no compensation can be awarded.\n\nRR, para. 132, citing to CR, para. 334.\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that Mr Pey Casado was duly notified of the comprehensive reparations programme for military-era expropriations promulgated through Law No. 19,568, and invited to participate in it,306 but, under the \u2018fork-in-the-road' provision in the BIT that required a choice between international and domestic remedies, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation chose to notify the Chilean Ministry of National Assets that they would not pursue any claims through the 1998 programme.307\n\nRR, para. 133, citing Exh. R-101, Letter from the Chilean Minister of National Assets to V. Pey Casado, 20 November 1995, para. 4.\n\nExh. R-1, letter from J. Garc\u00e9s to the Chilean Minister of National Assets, 24 June 1999, pp. 3-4; see also Hearings, Day 1, pp. 180, 184.\n\n153.\n\nWith respect to Decision No. 43, which authorized the payment of compensation to the successors and representatives of four individuals who had established that they had owned assets belonging to CPP,308 the Respondent submits that the Claimants have mischaracterized the procedural history leading to the finding of discrimination; according to the Respondent, no quantifiable injury stems from the events that constituted the discrimination violation.309\n\nSee Exh. R-148, Decision No. 43, 28 April 2000, pp. 3-5.\n\nRR, para. 136; see also Hearings, Day 2, p. 27.\n\n154.\n\nThe 1998 Reparations Law was the only source of any right to compensation for the Claimants, but the right was extinguished by the express waiver of participation in the reparations programme;310 once a decision had been made on a particular asset, it was no longer possible for other claims to be filed over that asset under the Law.311 The letter sent by Mr Pey Casado to the President of Chile in September 1995 did not create a \u2018freestanding' right to compensation for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* ; on that reasoning, a respondent State would be in violation of its BIT obligations every time it were to reject or deny any compensation request made by any claimant, regardless of the merits of any such request.312\n\nRR, paras. 140-1, RCM, para. 260, and Hearings, Day 2, p. 23; see also RR, paras. 149-150.\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 101-02.\n\nRR, paras. 137-40.\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the argument that, but for the paralysis and rejection of their claims within the Chilean domestic system, the Claimants would have received compensation for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*.313 According to the Respondent, the Claimants' actions were confined to efforts to stop the execution of Decision No. 43, and did not at any point include any affirmative request for compensation for the full expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*.314 The Respondent suggests that to put the Claimants in the position of there having been no violation of the BIT would only result in the suspension of Decision No. 43, and that no compensation for the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn* would have been awarded.315\n\nRR, para. 137.\n\nRR, para. 142.\n\nRR, paras. 142-143.\n\n*d. The Claimants cannot identify any injury caused by the discrimination violation*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent argues further that, because Decision No. 43 does not address Mr Pey Casado's rights, nor did it conflict with the then ongoing Goss press case or affect the ICSID dispute between the parties, it cannot be said to have caused any injury to the Claimants;316 any injury that might be said to exist was caused by the Claimants' own conscious decision not to participate in the 1998 reparations programme.317 Even if the administrative process that led to Decision No. 43 had been suspended, no benefit would have accrued to the Claimants.318 Decision No. 43 was not issued with the aim of frustrating the Claimants' rights, notably the right to arbitration, and the First Tribunal has already rejected the Claimants' arguments on this point.319\n\nRCM, para. 281; RR, para. 147.\n\nRCM, paras. 282-83.\n\nRCM, paras. 250-51, 290, 293-4; RR, paras. 148, 151.\n\nRR, para. 154.\n\n157.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that, though the *ad hoc* Committee did not annul the First Tribunal's conclusion that the Claimants are entitled to compensation, that does not endow the present Tribunal with a general discretion to award compensation, unless the Claimants can meet the usual requirements to prove causation and quantum.320 The Respondent recalls the finding of the First Tribunal that Decision No. 43 could only be considered a violation of Article 4 of the BIT, and not a violation of Articles 3 and 5.321 As the Claimants had expressly waived their right to assert claims under the 1998 reparations programme, no harm is attributable to the discrimination engendered by Decision No. 43; therefore, no compensation is to be awarded.322\n\nRCM, paras. 250-51; RR, para. 156.\n\nRCM, para. 274, citing to Exh. R-27, Award, 8 May 2008, para. 652.\n\nRCM, para. 269; RR, paras. 157-58.\n\n(3) **The calculation of damages**\n----------------------------------\n\n*a. Accuracy's damages calculations cannot be regarded as reliable*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, as shown by the Navigant Expert Reports, Accuracy's damages calculations cannot be relied upon, as they are methodologically and logically unsound, speculative and contrary to explicit determinations in the First Award and Annulment decision,323 particularly in that they have not calculated separately damages for the discrimination violation or the denial of justice violation.324 The damages assessment presented by Navigant, the Respondent's expert, is thus entirely appropriate as an alternative assessment. In any event it is the Claimants who bear the burden of proof in demonstrating, for damages purposes, the situation that would have obtained but for the relevant violations of the BIT established by the un-annulled portions of the First Award.\n\nRCM, paras. 321-22; RR, paras. 160-162.\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 67-68, 107.\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent argues that adverse inferences cannot be drawn against it for the nonproduction of documents requested by the Claimants in March and November 2014; the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration only permit adverse inferences to be drawn \u2018[i]f a Party fails without satisfactory explanation to produce any Document requested in a Request to Produce to which it has not objected in due time or fails to produce any Document ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal.' but here the Tribunal had rejected the Claimants' requests in their entirety.325\n\nCR, para. 163, citing Procedural Order No. 2, 16 December 2014, paras. 6-7.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent regards Accuracy's damages calculation as speculative because the Claimants have quantified the same injury with figures that have diverged substantially: US$515 million in their Request for Arbitration;326 US$397 million in their CounterMemorial on Merits and Jurisdiction;327 US$797 million during the Revision Proceeding;328 and in the present proceeding, US$338 million.329 The Respondent suggests that these figures vary by more than 692 percent, and Accuracy provides five different damages estimates which range from US$91,669,220 to US$329,678,000.330\n\nExh.

The Claimants are not entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent submits that unjust enrichment is not a legitimate methodology for the quantification of damages in this proceeding, as it exceeds the scope of the Tribunal's authority,336 but also as a general matter of damages under international law.337 The Respondent submits, in the alternative, that even if a causal link did exist between the BIT violations found in the First Award and the damages assessments submitted by the Claimants, the Respondent has disgorged whatever enrichment it might have derived from the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* in virtue of the payment made to Messrs Sainte-Marie, Carrasco, Gonz\u00e1lez and Venegas under Decision No. 43.338 In any case, the Respondent challenges the Claimants' estimates as involving several levels of conjecture, including the calculation of rental amounts from 1973 to 2013 using inappropriate valuation methodology, and in some cases the fact that the rental properties no longer existed.339\n\nRCM, paras. 178, 224-25, 233.\n\nRR, para. 169, fn. 430.\n\nRR, para. 170.\n\nRCM, para. 327; see also Hearings, Day 3, pp. 152-54.\n\n*c. A tax gross-up would not be appropriate*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent contends that a tax gross-up in any amount would be improper and unprecedented;340 any potential domestic tax obligations of the Claimants cannot be considered \u2018losses' for purposes of damage recovery under international investment arbitration, as they are not directly attributable to the opposing party in the investment dispute.341 In the alternative, the Respondent argues that neither the Claimants nor their experts have invoked any legal provision currently in force in Chile or any other jurisdiction to sustain the proposition that the Claimants would be taxed on an eventual award in this case,342 and have failed to account for the potential implications of multi-jurisdictional tax treatment.343 However, the Respondent submits that in any event the few tribunals that have addressed claims for a tax gross-up have uniformly rejected them.344\n\nRR, para. 171.\n\nExh.

Interest cannot be added to any award of damages*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent rejects outright any entitlement to interest on an award of damages in this case. The Claimants' claim to pre-award interest from September 1973 bears no relationship to the dates of the Article 4 BIT violations found in the First Award.345 The calculations are based on US dollars, despite the fact that the *El Clar\u00edn* Group's revenues and expenses were earned and incurred in Chilean escudos. The interest rate proposed is moreover an artificially inflated one.346\n\nRCM, paras. 338-340; RR, para. 181.\n\nRR, para. 182.\n\n167.\n\nWith respect to the post-Award phase, the Respondent contends that most of the time elapsed since the issuance of the First Award has been spent by the parties addressing issues raised or proceedings commenced by the Claimants, or awaiting the decisions of the First Tribunal and the *ad hoc* Committee, and that to allow interest to accrue during that period would reward the Claimants for their unsuccessful invocation of remedies while punishing the Respondent for its successful request for annulment.347 The Respondent also challenges the Claimant's request for a compounded interest rate of 10% on any future Award issued by the Tribunal, which has no basis in the actual purpose, intent or conventions regarding the application of interest rates. To propose, as the Claimants do, that post-Award interest compound on a monthly basis deviates from compounding convention, which requires that the compounding periodicity be dictated by the interest rate.348\n\nRCM, para. 339.\n\nRR, paras. 183-184.\n\n*e. The Respondent seeks an award of costs and fees, including legal fees.*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimants to reimburse all costs and fees, including legal fees, incurred by it in this Resubmission Proceeding.349 It contends that the Claimants have distorted the contents of the Santiago court ruling to an extent that seems designed to mislead the Tribunal, and thus constitutes an abuse of process warranting penalization in the form of an award of costs.350\n\nRCM, para. 343.\n\nRR, para. 112.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants have resorted to improper and unduly convoluted claims and arguments; have publicly accused the Respondent's counsel of bad faith, by uploading pleadings and correspondence in which they challenged the impartiality of Dr Libedinsky and the conduct of Ms Macchiavello and Mr Di Rosa;351 in addition, they have belaboured procedural points and improperly appealed certain issues; and generally have exacerbated the dispute through vexatious litigation tactics. In the circumstances, and in the light of these tactics, the Tribunal should order the Claimants to meet all the Respondent's costs and expenses, including legal and expert fees.352\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 121-26.\n\nRCM, para. 342; RR, paras. 185-188.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent's costs claim in respect of the present Resubmission Proceeding totals US$3,919,887.56.353\n\nSee Letter of the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 29 May 2015.\n\n**III.ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Introduction: the Role of a New Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nIn coming to its decision on this case, the Tribunal is all too conscious (as it has been throughout the earlier phases of this resubmission proceeding) of how long it is since the events took place that gave rise to the dispute between the Parties, and indeed of the quite unusual length of the totality of the arbitral proceedings since their inception all of nineteen years ago. The Tribunal is aware, too, of the passion with which the case has been fought on both sides, and of the way in which the facts underlying the case entwine high politics with the personal fate of individuals, and commercial and economic relations with personal connections and family relationships.354 The Tribunal has therefore done its utmost to listen with careful and sympathetic attention to all of the arguments that have been brought before it by the Parties in writing and orally, without seeking to apply in advance any *a priori* criterion of selection as to which of them would ultimately prove relevant and material to its Award.\n\nAs noted by the First Tribunal at paragraphs 690-691 of its Award.\n\n172.\n\nThe time has however now come for these arbitral proceedings to be brought to their final end; reipublicae interest ut finis sit litium. The Tribunal will now proceed to do so, with an expression of gratitude to all Parties and their counsel for the thoroughness of their arguments, but a reminder that its function, as an arbitration tribunal under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, is to decide according to the applicable law, in its relation to the established facts. In the absence of any agreement to that effect between the Parties, the Tribunal has no power to decide their dispute *ex aequo et bono*.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal thinks it as well to recall at the outset the limited nature of its task. These are resubmission proceedings, following the partial annulment of the First Tribunal's Award. They are thus governed by Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that: \"If the award is annulled, the dispute shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to a new Tribunal constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.\" The present Tribunal is of course that \u2018new Tribunal' and will address below what is to be understood as \u2018the dispute' in the context of the partial annulment of the First Award. For good measure, and because of its direct relevance to that question, it is noted that Rule 55(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides specifically: \"If the original award had only been annulled in part, the new Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled.\" The Tribunal will also address below what is meant by \u2018reconsider' in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n174.\n\nIt remains to recall, as the framework for what is to follow, the exact terms in which the *ad hoc* Committee brought about the partial annulment of the First Award, in its Decision of 18 December 2011:\n\nPar ces motifs, le Comit\u00e9 rend les d\u00e9cisions suivantes :\n\n1. d\u00e9cide d'annuler le paragraphe 4 du dispositif de la Sentence du 8 mai 2008 et les paragraphes correspondants dans le corps de la Sentence relatifs aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats (Section VIII) conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 52(1)(d) et (e) ;\n\n2. rejette les autres fondements de la Demande en annulation de la R\u00e9publique ;\n\n3. rejette la demande des Demanderesses tendant \u00e0 l'annulation partielle du paragraphe 8 du dispositif de la Sentence ;\n\n4. estime que les paragraphes 1 \u00e0 3 et 5 \u00e0 8 du dispositif ainsi que le corps de la Sentence, \u00e0 l'exception de la Section VIII, ont autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e.355\n\nThere follow three further paragraphs, but they deal solely with costs and with the suspension of execution, and are thus immaterial for the purposes of the present resubmission proceedings.\n\n175.\n\nTo understand the import of this Decision, it is of course necessary to recall as well the *dispositif* of the First Award to which it refers. This reads as follows:\n\n1. d\u00e9cide qu'il est comp\u00e9tent pour conna\u00eetre du litige entre les demanderesses et la R\u00e9publique du Chili ;\n\n2. constate que la d\u00e9fenderesse a viol\u00e9 son obligation de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les demanderesses d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, en ce compris celle de s'abstenir de tout d\u00e9ni de justice\n\n3. constate que les demanderesses ont droit \u00e0 compensation356 ;\n\n4. ordonne \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique du Chili de payer aux demanderesses le montant de USD 10,132,690.18, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 5%, compos\u00e9 annuellement, \u00e0 compter du 11 avril 2002 jusqu'\u00e0 la date d'envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence ;\n\n5. met \u00e0 la charge de la d\u00e9fenderesse une contribution aux frais et d\u00e9pens expos\u00e9s par les demanderesses, d'un montant de USD 2,000,000,- (deux millions) ;\n\n6. d\u00e9cide que les frais de proc\u00e9dure seront support\u00e9s par les parties dans la proportion de : 3/4 du montant total (soit USD 3,136,893.34) pour la d\u00e9fenderesse et 1/4 du montant total (soit 1,045,631.11) pour les demanderesses ; ordonne en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de payer aux demanderesses la somme de USD 1,045,579.35 ;\n\n7. ordonne \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique du Chili de proc\u00e9der au paiement dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date d'envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence, des sommes figurant dans le pr\u00e9sent dispositif (points 4, 5 et 6), faute de quoi le montant portera int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s annuellement au taux de 5%, \u00e0 compter de la date d'envoi de la pr\u00e9sente sentence jusqu'\u00e0 celle du parfait paiement ;\n\n8. rejette toutes autres ou plus amples conclusions.\n\nThe French term \u2018compensation' is translated in what follows, literally, as \u2018compensation'. The Tribunal is conscious that, in doing so, it is at risk of begging an important question, which will be discussed further below, but no better translation seems to be available.\n\n176.\n\nIt will be evident, therefore, that the *ad hoc* Committee has been at great pains to delineate clearly the contours of the partial annulment brought about by its Decision of 18 December 2011. The reason, one may assume, was the entirely laudable desire to exclude any room for doubt as to the meaning and scope of its Decision, and the consequences that follow from it. The intention was also, no doubt, to ease the burden on the Parties by making it plain what remained open for re-litigation between them, and what (on the other hand) could not be re-opened because it had been finally determined with the quality of *res judicata* (or, in the French phrase used by the Committee, \u2018autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e'). To summarize, point by point, it has been finally determined: that the dispute falls within ICSID jurisdiction; that Chile (the Respondent) was in breach of its obligation to accord to the Claimants fair and equitable treatment (including to abstain from any denial of justice); that the Claimants have a right to compensation;357 and finally that any further or other claims were rejected.358 All of that, in other words, has the quality of *res judicata* (\u2018chose jug\u00e9e'), including, notably, the definitive rejection of all the Claimants' claims in the dispute other than those covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositive part of the First Award.\n\nSee note 356 above.\n\nThe further paragraphs dealing with the allocation of costs and the rate of interest payable in default have not been included in this summary, as they are not material to the present resubmission proceedings.\n\n177.\n\nConversely, what does remain open for re-litigation at the instance of the Claimants is the nature of the compensation due to them under paragraph 3 in consequence of the breach established in paragraph 2, following the annulment of the assessment made by the First Tribunal in paragraph 4. It must also be assumed (notwithstanding the incidental inclusion of a reference to paragraph 4 in paragraph 7, which is in turn expressly stated by the *ad hoc* Committee to be *res judicata*) that, if any monetary compensation was awarded by the present Tribunal, the due date for payment is also a matter that remains at large, to be established by the Tribunal in this Award.\n\n178.\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from the above - and it is an inescapable one - is that the present Tribunal is absolved from any need to investigate afresh whether there was any breach of Chile's obligations towards the Claimants in respect of the present dispute, what that breach consisted in, or whether the breach gives rise to a right to compensation. All of those matters have been predetermined by the First Award and are binding on all Parties under Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention. Not only is there no need for the Tribunal to go into these matters, but it would be a manifest excess of its own jurisdiction if the Tribunal purported to do so. That is the express consequence of Arbitration Rule 55(3), cited above. Before this Tribunal, all that remains in \u2018dispute' between the Parties in these resubmission proceedings (in terms of Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention) is the nature of the compensation due for the breach or breaches already established by the First Tribunal, and, if the present Tribunal should find that that compensation should take a monetary form, the amount thereof.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore confine itself strictly to noting and analysing the First Tribunal's finding of breach, and the principles of compensation that follow from that finding, and, having done so, to applying those findings so as to arrive, in the light of the arguments put before it by the Parties, at the proper compensation that is due, as well as any consequential matters which hinge on that.\n\n**B. The Claimants in the Present Resubmission Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nBefore proceeding to do so however, it will be convenient for the Tribunal to establish who should be understood as the Parties before it. In a normal situation, this question seldom arises; that it does so now is because of the doubts raised by the Respondent in respect of the appearance of Ms Coral Pey Grebe among those for whom counsel for the Claimants state that they are acting in these proceedings.\n\n181.\n\nTo recapitulate: the original Request for Arbitration was brought against the Republic of Chile in the name of Mr Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation \u2018President Allende'; it was registered by the Centre under that name as ARB/98/2, and that is the way it was known throughout the original proceedings. The First Award specifies that Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation are the Claimants in the proceedings, from which it necessarily follows that they are the beneficiaries of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the *dispositif* of the First Award cited above. To be more precise, the finding in paragraph 1 must be understood as a determination of the Tribunal's jurisdiction over claims brought by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation; and the findings in paragraphs 2 and 3 as to the existence of a breach, and the consequential entitlement to compensation, establish rights which vest in Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation.\n\n182.\n\nThe annulment proceedings were conducted in the same way, and in accordance with standard ICSID practice under the identical ICSID case reference; the Republic of Chile appears as Applicant, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation as Respondents, and each are specified as such in the wording of the Decision on Annulment, including therefore the dispositive paragraphs cited in paragraph 174 above.\n\n183.\n\nIt follows automatically from this that, following the delivery to them of the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision on 18 December 2012, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation became, along with the Republic of Chile, the beneficiaries of the entitlement under Rule 55(1) to request the resubmission of the annulled part of the dispute to a new tribunal, and this is indeed exactly what was done in the \u2018Nouvelle Requ\u00eate d'arbitrage' lodged with the Secretary-General on 18 June 2013 and registered by the Secretary-General under the same title as before, namely *Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende v. The Republic of Chile*, and the same case reference as before, ARB/98/2.\n\n184.\n\nIt remains only to note, in the interests of clarity, that - although the annulment had been sought by the Republic of Chile (Respondent in the Arbitration), and although there was a cross-application by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation (Claimants in the Arbitration) - the net effect of the *ad hoc* Committee's upholding (in part) the Respondent's application, even while rejecting that by the Claimants, was nevertheless in practical terms to open up to the Claimants the opportunity to seek resubmission of the unresolved parts of the dispute, which indeed is the way matters turned out as indicated in paragraph 183 above. Nor is there anything untoward in this procedural state of affairs, given the reciprocal terms of Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention (paragraph 173 above).\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent now complains that the claims and requests for relief now pleaded by the Claimants in the name of Ms Pey Grebe are barred by the Convention and the Rules. This objection attaches itself to the Claimants' Memorial on Resubmission to which (although the case title remains as described above) counsel subscribes as \u2018Repr\u00e9sentant de M. Victor Pey-Casado, Mme. Coral Pey Grebe et de la Fondation espagnole Pr\u00e9sident Allende', and more particularly it attaches itself to point (4) in the requests for relief contained in paragraph 514 of the Memorial which seeks a payment to Ms Pey Grebe in respect of moral damage. The Respondent says that this request is procedurally improper, and also lacks any factual basis as Ms Pey Grebe was neither party to the Chilean court proceedings at the heart of the denial of justice claim, nor could there have been moral prejudice to her from events taking place many years before she could assert any rights in relation to *El Clar\u00edn*. The Respondent adds that it is in any case not permissible for a newly named claimant to benefit from the First Tribunal's finding of jurisdiction without establishing jurisdiction *ratione personae* in her own regard, and that doubts subsist as to whether Ms Pey Grebe would, on closer examination, so qualify (paragraphs 173-130 above).\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants' answer is that jurisdiction is determined once and for all as of the date of the initiation of proceedings, and cannot be affected by events after that date; that Ms Pey Grebe is the beneficiary of the valid cession to her, recognized by the First Tribunal, of Mr Pey Casado's rights, which include the rights arising out of the First Award; and that the reason underlying the cession was simply Mr Pey Casado's very advanced age (paragraphs 43-48 above).\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal is sympathetic towards the points put forward on this matter by both sides, but feels, on mature consideration, that the matter has been taken beyond its real intrinsic importance in the argument that has developed between them. On the one hand, it is undoubtedly true that a new claimant party cannot simply freeload on the back of the jurisdictional claims of others, but must establish jurisdiction in his or her own right under the usual criteria. On the other hand, there is no dispute between the two sides that there has been a cession of rights, in good faith, between Mr Pey Casado and his daughter, which has been made for good reason, or that both the cession itself and the reason for it were disclosed to the Tribunal, as they had been to the First Tribunal at an earlier stage. Nevertheless, if the cession of rights should be understood as transferring to Ms Pey Grebe her father's substantive rights, then the effect would be that Mr Pey Casado had lost standing and could not now appear as claimant; but even then the transfer would not have been such as to satisfy the normal requirement of an identity of parties. That said, the legal materials on the subject of cessions of rights, which have been debated between the Parties, are directed to ensuring that arrangements for the way in which investments are held cannot be used as a device for evading the jurisdictional requirements of either the ICSID Convention or (as the case may be) a particular investment treaty. That is not the case here. The jurisdictional link as between Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation, and the Republic of Chile, has been definitively established by the First Award, and is *res judicata* ; those persons or entities continue to be the Parties under whose name the present proceedings are conducted, and the Tribunal notes that the claim for moral damages, to which the Respondent has referred, is in fact phrased as a claim \"au titre de la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale du pr\u00e9judice moral subi par M. Victor Pey Casado et la Fondation espagnole du fait des violations de l'API par la R\u00e9publique du Chili\" [emphasis added].359 There is no dispute that, whatever procedural inexactitudes there may be in the formulation of some of the pleadings, the substance of the arrangements in their actual operation is that Ms Pey Grebe, the daughter, acts in practice as the legal representative of her aged father. It may be that the formulations used were intended to signal to the Tribunal that counsel for the Claimants were in practice taking detailed instructions from Ms Pey Grebe on her father's behalf, rather than from Mr Pey Casado in person; and, if so, the Tribunal can see nothing in the least improper about that. By the same token, the Tribunal was gratified to note, in the Respondent's written pleadings,360 an indication that the Respondent too, for its part, would have no objection to a practical arrangement of that kind in the particular circumstances of the case. The Tribunal will accordingly proceed as set out in the next following paragraph.\n\nCR, para. 501(1).\n\nRCM, para. 195; RR, para. 21.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal is clear that the present proceedings are a continuation of the original arbitration, such that the title and case reference remain unchanged, as do the Parties to the proceedings. The only Claimants are therefore Mr Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation, and the Respondent is the Republic of Chile. Such compensation as may be awarded pursuant to the partial annulment will accordingly be awarded to these named Claimants, and will be in respect of the injury suffered by these Claimants as the result of the breaches identified, as *res judicata*, in the First Award. Ms Pey Grebe will be regarded as the representative of Mr Pey Casado for all purposes relating to the award of such compensation. Should the Tribunal decide that the compensation is to take a monetary form, the payment over of the moneys due to each of the two entitled Claimants will be a matter for internal arrangement between them in which their designated counsel will play their duly appointed role as counsel to Ms Pey Grebe as well. On that basis, the Tribunal can now proceed to analyse the admissibility of the claims for relief put forward by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation.\n\n**C. The Claimants' Requests for Relief**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants' requests for relief can be found at paragraph 514 of their Memorial. They consist of seven claims for damages, or subsidiarily for unjust enrichment, which have remained to all intents and purposes intact throughout the subsequent proceedings, although they were subject to some further elaboration in the Reply Memorial. The first three claims relate to compensation for the damage suffered as a result of the Respondent's breaches of Article 4 of the BIT, together with lost profits, or failing that for reimbursement of the unjust enrichment enjoyed by the Respondent; the sums claimed are of the order of US$330 millions or US$92 millions, both at 2014 values. The fourth head is a claim to moral damages, in the order of something in excess of US$10 millions. The remaining three heads are consequential claims to tax equalization, to interest, and for costs.\n\n190.\n\nThe claims to damages are, in other words, substantial. To understand the basis on which the main claims are put forward, it will be most convenient to look first at the methods adopted for their quantification in the expert report on which the Claimants rely and then to the legal reasoning on which the Claimants seek to justify them.\n\n191.\n\nThe expert report by Mr Eduard Saura of Accuracy (who also testified orally at the hearing, confirming his report361) states that it takes as its starting point the First Tribunal's finding of a breach by the Respondent of its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment and to refrain from discrimination. It includes under the former a denial of justice by the Respondent which deprived the Claimants of their possibility of obtaining indemnification for the true value of their assets seized since the *coup d'\u00e9tat* in 1973. It computes this true value by assessing the fair market value of the seized assets at the time of their seizure and then uprating that to current values, in a manner said to be consistent with normal practice in arbitration. The subsidiary method put forward in the alternative, under the rubric of unjust enrichment, consists in cumulating the assessed amounts of the capital value of the immovable properties expropriated by the Respondent, the rental income from those properties since their seizure, and the asset value of the movable property that had been seized together with the real property (notably the Goss printing press).\n\nThe report by Accuracy, and a supplementary report responding to the rebuttal report submitted by the Respondent, were co-signed by Mr Christophe Schmit but, as Mr Saura appeared on his own to testify at the hearing, the reports are referred to in his name alone; this is purely for convenience.\n\n192.\n\nMr Saura was not tasked with making an assessment of the claim to moral damages, which in turn is not quantified by the Claimants themselves either, save simply to state minimum figures in their Memorial and Reply Memorial (where the figures are amounts not less than US$10 millions and US$500,000 claimed in respect of Mr Pey Casado and of the Foundation). Mr Saura did not advance, either in his expert report or in his oral testimony at the hearing, any other methodology for assessing the Claimants' damages or compensation for unjust enrichment.\n\n**D. The Admissibility of the Claimants' Claims**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, rejects the basis for each of the above, though on different grounds in each case: as to the fair market value of the seized properties, the Respondent says that this is no more and no less than reverting to the claims for expropriation which were expressly rejected by the First Tribunal as outside its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* ; as to the unjust enrichment alternative, the Respondent says once again that it harks back to the original expropriation, although on a theory of \u2018continuing expropriation' which is equally incompatible with the un-annulled portions of the First Award; and as to moral damage, the Respondent says that (quite apart from the fact that the argumentation adduced links this yet again to the original expropriation), the common understanding is that moral damage falls outside the scope of \u2018compensation' of the kind provided for in the First Award.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus confronted with what amount to objections to the admissibility of all of the main claims as formulated by the Claimants in their submissions, which it is therefore appropriate to determine first, before proceeding to any consideration that may be necessary of how the Claimants have themselves quantified these claims.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that the breaches found by the First Tribunal in its Award (see paragraph 175 above) consist in a violation of \u2018son obligation de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les demanderesses d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, en ce compris celle de s'abstenir de tout d\u00e9ni de justice'. In reaching this conclusion, the First Tribunal had already decided, in an earlier section of its First Award, that the substantive protections of the BIT did not extend retroactively so as to cover the Claimants' dispossession by the Respondent in the period between 1973 and 1975: \u2018[a]ussi le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l'expropriation dont se plaignent les demanderesses doit \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e d'acte instantan\u00e9, ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'API. Cette analyse est conforme \u00e0 la position de principe de la Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de l'homme qui consid\u00e8re l'expropriation comme un acte instantan\u00e9 et qui ne cr\u00e9e pas une situation continue de \u00ab *privation d'un droit* \u00bb.'362 These findings were left untouched in the decision on annulment. The ICSID Arbitration Rules explicitly prohibit the present Tribunal from reconsidering them. None of this is contested between the Parties. It would seem however, at first sight, to put an insuperable obstacle in the way of the Claimants now advancing a claim to damage which in its essence goes back to that original dispossession, by using the value of the then-expropriated property as its central element.\n\nSee also paragraphs 610, 620, and 622 of the First Award.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants' answer to this objection is somewhat complex. In certain places, the Claimants contend that elements of the non-annulled parts of the First Award need to be revisited and modified by the present Tribunal. That would however (as already indicated) be well beyond the Tribunal's functions and powers under ICSID Arbitration Rule 55 and will not be further considered in this Award. The main substance of the Claimants' answer is, however, different. It consists essentially in the contention that the central consequence of the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press, was that they (the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely null (*ex tunc*) and as such incapable of producing any legal effects. Had they been in a position to do so, the argument continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able to recover their confiscated property in Chile, or at the least would have been able to establish before the First Tribunal that the expropriation of this property was not an instantaneous act taking final effect in 1975, but was not in fact completed until many years later, and the result of that would have been that the expropriation did indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal under the BIT, contrary to the findings in the First Award. From this it follows, so the Claimants' argument concludes, that the loss suffered by them arising out of the denial of justice is the loss of that right to compensation in the original arbitration, so that such loss is the one they can now claim in the present proceedings.\n\n**E. The Status of Decree No. 165**\n-----------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThis might therefore be the convenient place for a brief excursus on the status of Decree No. 165 under Chilean public law, a subject that absorbed an appreciable portion of the argument between the Parties, both in the written phase and at the oral hearing. The burden of the Claimants' argument has already been given in paragraph 196 above. The Respondent countered it with the evidence of an expert witness on Chilean law, in the person of Dr Marcos Libedinsky Tschorne, formerly President of the Chilean Supreme Court and Member of the Constitutional Court of Chile. His evidence was, in essence, that the better view is that the absolute nullity of a legislative decree requires a judicial pronouncement to that effect, that in any event there was no request for a declaration of nullity by the claimant in the Goss press case, and finally that no such declaration of nullity can be inferred from the terms of the Santiago court's judgment of 2008 in that case. The Claimants produced no expert witness of their own, contenting themselves with offering, through counsel (none of them Chilean lawyers), their own interpretation of Chilean law, and casting aspersions on Dr Libedinsky's accuracy and *bona fides*. The Tribunal, for its part, can appreciate the good sense in Dr Libedinsky's explanation of the reasons why, both in logic and in the interests of good administration, as serious a matter as the nullity *ab initio* of a legislative act should presuppose an express judicial pronouncement to that effect, nor can it find any reason to doubt either Dr Libedinsky's good faith or his independence and objectivity. It takes note, finally, of the complex formula in which the Claimants have clothed their proposition, i.e. that a Chilean court \u2018would be under the obligation to take note of the reality of the nullity of Decree No. 165 *ex tunc* ', and finds in the very contorted shape of this proposition the strong implication that it has more in it of the speculative than of the operational.\n\n198.\n\nThe above having been said, the Tribunal sees no need to go further into the matter as it has concluded that, even if the Claimants were able to establish the proposition for which they have been arguing, it would have no material bearing on these resubmission proceedings. What the Claimants wish to argue is that, inasmuch as Decree No. 165 was never (so they allege) a valid legal act, there never was a legally effective expropriation of the investment at all, so that the legal ownership of *El Clar\u00edn* and the associated assets rested where it had been in 1973 and 1975 (subject only to the subsequent cession to the Foundation). The main difficulty resides, however, not in this proposition itself, as in the conclusions the Claimants would seek to draw from it, so far as the remedies available in the present proceedings are concerned. As the Tribunal sees it, there are only two: one is that the First Tribunal was wrong in its finding that the expropriation was excluded *ratione temporis* from the scope of the BIT; the other is that what amounted in effect (if not in form) to the expropriation took place with Decision No. 43. Each of these has figured, in various forms, in the submissions of the Claimants in the course of these resubmission proceedings. Both of them, however, encounter insuperable difficulties. As to the first, the Tribunal is in no doubt that the First Tribunal, although it used slightly different forms of words in different parts of its Award, was of the view that the expropriation was completed (*fait consomm\u00e9*) with the physical seizure in 1975 and thus fell outside the scope of the BIT. More to the point, however, the present Tribunal is simply not empowered to hear an appeal against that finding, or to substitute a view of its own for that of the First Tribunal, or to award any relief of any kind whatsoever on that account. As to the second (i.e. that the effective expropriation did not take place until Decision No. 43), it is also in its turn incompatible with the First Tribunal's findings as to the chronology of the expropriation, but it is equally incompatible with Decision No. 43 itself, the whole tenor of which is that it was an award of compensation in respect of a confiscation *that had already occurred*.363 The Tribunal's final observation before leaving the subject, is that, if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decision No. 43 did indeed have decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment continued to be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation - the remedy for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal in these resubmission proceedings.\n\nAt p. 3 of the Decision, it is noted expressly that \u2018les biens identifi\u00e9s ci-dessus furent confisqu\u00e9s... en application du D.L. No. 77 de 1973. lequel a dissous les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s consid\u00e9r\u00e9es pr\u00eate-noms de partis politiques d\u00e9termin\u00e9s qui y \u00e9taient sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s, et a dispos\u00e9 de leurs biens.'\n\n**F. Compensation under the First Award and International Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal must revert at this point to the question raised earlier in this Award as to the meaning of the word \u2018compensation' in the First Award. As the Tribunal pointed out above in paragraphs 174 and following, the original and authentic text of the First Award is French, and it establishes, in paragraph 3 of the *dispositif*, with the effect of *res judicata*, that the Claimants \u2018ont droit \u00e0 compensation'. The Tribunal has given consideration to the question whether this formulation should be understood to mean, in and of itself, that the Claimants have an accrued right to monetary compensation, and that the only question remaining for decision in these resubmission proceedings is the assessment of the appropriate amount of such compensation. The Tribunal has however come to the conclusion that that would not be the correct way to understand the meaning and effect of the First Award.\n\n200.\n\nThere are various reasons for this conclusion, which reinforce one another. One is that both terms, the English as well as the French, have a broader dictionary connotation not restricted to making good in a purely financial sense. Another is that, taken in its context, paragraph 3 of the *dispositif* plainly states only the general principle of reparation; but neither this paragraph, nor paragraph 2 which precedes it, seeks to determine the nature of the injury or damage caused by the Respondent's breach, which would be the essential precursor for then determining the kind as well as the extent of the reparation required to remedy the breach. The Parties have expressed strongly divergent views on this question, which can best be summarized through their responses to the question posed by the Tribunal during the oral hearing, namely whether paragraph 3 should be regarded as having an independent meaning, separate from paragraph 4, and whether the Tribunal should understand the term \u2018compensation' as referring only to monetary compensation, or more generally to the forms of reparation recognized in international law in the case of international wrongs. The response for the Claimants was that paragraph 4 represented the mere quantification of the right to be compensated; but that, starting from the authentic French language text of the First Award, the right to be compensated \"exclusively refers to a financial notion, harm that is quantifiable financially, and nothing else; for instance, reparation or satisfaction in public international law\".364 The Respondent, for its part, agreed with much of the Claimants' answer, namely that paragraphs 3 and 4 do have independent meanings, that under paragraph 3 \"Claimants are entitled to the form of reparation comprised by damages that are financially assessable\" but that this form of reparation, or other forms of reparation under international law, \"would be available so long as Claimants (1) establish causation - that is, establish the necessary link between the BIT violation and the form of monetary damages they seek - and (2) meet their burden of proving their specific monetary damages.\"365\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 26-27.\n\nHearings, Day 4, pp. 95-96\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of these views, but does not subscribe fully to the reading that the First Tribunal was using (to reprise the original French) the term *compensation* in paragraph 3 as a specific, limiting term of art, intended to be differentiated from the more general *indemnisation* or *r\u00e9paration*. The Tribunal sees in the First Award no sign that the First Tribunal was setting out to make a conceptually systematic usage of these various terms that would justify treating paragraph 3 as a deliberate determination that monetary damages must necessarily follow (provided of course that their amount was properly established). Taking the paragraph in its context, the Tribunal reads paragraph 3 as stating the entitlement to reparation that necessarily follows from the determination of the breach of an international obligation, but without predetermining what form or nature that reparation must take, except perhaps the non-explicit assumption that in the normal case it may take the form of monetary damages. But it does not read the paragraph as absolving a party claiming monetary damages from its normal obligation to prove such damage, including its causation.366\n\nCf. the First Tribunal's view expressed in paragraph 690 of its Award, although this is not *res judicata*, appearing as it does in Chapter VIII.\n\n202.\n\nIt remains, then, for this Tribunal to determine what nature and form of \u2018compensation' is thus due, in the wake of the annulment of the First Tribunal's assessment, as laid down in paragraph 4 on the basis of the reasoning in the corresponding part (Section VIII) of the First Award.\n\n203.\n\nTo do this, the Tribunal must apply, in the absence of any specific rules in the BIT, the applicable rules of general international law.\n\n204.\n\nBoth sides have invoked in this respect the provisions of Part Two of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts drawn up by the International Law Commission (ILC) and commended to States by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001. As stated in Article 31, the principal obligation of the responsible State is \"to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" The Article goes on to specify that \u2018injury' in this context includes \"any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\" In the Commentary to this Article, the ILC indicates that it based itself on the classic formulations given by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case, according to which the responsible State must endeavour to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" Both sides in the present proceedings have, once again, relied on this *dictum* and discussed its application to the circumstances of the case. The Tribunal, for its part, notes that what both the PCIJ, and the ILC in turn, had in their direct contemplation was the legal consequences of an internationally wrongful \u2018act' - as opposed to the more complex situation here, which (as indicated above) is one in which the breach is constituted not by a single act but by a course of conduct.367 It notes, secondly, that the operation of the primary rule enunciated by the ILC depends upon injury, and that injury in turn depends on causation; both of these terms, \u2018injury' and \u2018causation', appear in each of the two paragraphs of Article 31. It becomes necessary, therefore, for the Tribunal to isolate what conduct was held by the First Tribunal to constitute in the present case the \u2018wrongful act', and then to determine, in the light of the submissions of the opposing Parties, how the rule reflected in Article 31 is to be applied to that set of circumstances.\n\nThe ILC does foresee, in draft Article 15, a breach brought about by a composite act, though in the context of when the breach is deemed to occur; there is no reason to think, however, that Article 31 does not also apply mutatis mutandis to composite acts.\n\n**G. The Burden of Proving Damage**\n-----------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nIt is a basic tenet of investment arbitration that a claimant must prove its pleaded loss, must show, in other words, what alleged injury or damage was caused by the breach of its legal rights. This is partly a consequence of the general principle in international judicial proceedings that each party bears the burden of establishing the allegations on which it relies. The International Court of Justice refers to this as a well-established rule which has been consistently upheld by the Court.368 The same rule has regularly been followed by investment tribunals.369 But equally it follows directly from the principles of State responsibility in international law reflected in Article 31 of the ILC Articles, under which the duty to make reparation is \u2018for the injury caused by' the internationally wrongful act; and \u2018injury' for these purposes is damage \u2018caused by' the internationally wrongful act. The International Law Commission explains that this definition is deliberately limitative, excluding merely abstract concerns or general interests, and further that material damage has to be understood as damage which is assessable in financial terms.370\n\nSee *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010 (ICJ Reports 2010), para. 162, and the long list of authorities there cited.\n\nSee e.g. *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, para. 177; *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Award, 7 July 2004, paras. 58, 81; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Award, 26 January 2006, para. 95; *Saipem S.p.A. v. The People's Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 March 2007, para. 83.\n\nSee Exh. RL-34, Commentaries to draft Article 31, paragraph (5) and to draft Article 36, paragraph (1).\n\n206.\n\nIt is thus axiomatic that this Tribunal (like the First Tribunal before it) is only competent to award reparation in the form of financial compensation to the extent that it has been duly established before it that the compensation represents a fair assessment of the alleged damage suffered by the Claimants that has actually been caused by the Respondent's breach of its international obligation towards them under the BIT.371\n\nExh.

Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL (Third Partial and Final Award), 23 November 2009; Exh. RL-25, *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v.

Kinnear, \u2018Damages in Investment Treaty Arbitration' in K. Yannaca-Small (ed.), *Arbitration under International Investment Agreements: A Guide to the Key Issues* (Oxford University Press, 2010) at p. 556.\n\n**H. The Interpretation of the First Award**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nAlthough, as already indicated, the Tribunal is required under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, in these resubmission proceedings, to refrain from reconsidering any portion of the First Award that had not been annulled, this does not, in the Tribunal's opinion, prevent the present Tribunal from proceeding to an interpretation of the First Award for the purposes of carrying out its mandate under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise; the essence of the Tribunal's mandate consists in giving effect, in the light of the arguments marshalled by the Parties, to certain paragraphs in the *dispositif* of the First Award, and this the Tribunal can hardly do without first understanding what those paragraphs mean. In other words, the Tribunal construes the injunction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) not to \u2018reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled' as laying down that the resubmission tribunal may not re-open such un-annulled portions or the reasoning on which they are based, but not as excluding the effort to arrive at a correct understanding of the meaning of the un-annulled portions for the purpose of putting them properly into effect. This interpretation of ICSID Rule 55(3) seems logically necessary, and is supported by the French text of the Rule, which employs the term \u2018nouvel examen' to describe what a new tribunal may not do. The Tribunal will accordingly proceed to consider what meaning should properly be attributed to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the *dispositif* of the First Award, notably the First Tribunal's finding in paragraph 2 that the Respondent \"a viol\u00e9 son obligation de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les demanderesses d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, en ce compris celle de s'abstenir de tout d\u00e9ni de justice\" to remedy which \"les demanderesses ont droit \u00e0 compensation\" under paragraph 3. This is the question which lies at the heart of these resubmission proceedings.\n\n208.\n\nThe question is nevertheless not without some considerable difficulty. It has occupied a large part of the argumentation of both Parties; and the Tribunal has some sympathy with the problems the Parties have faced over what exactly the First Tribunal should be understood as having meant with its findings recited above. Having given the most careful consideration to the submissions made to it by all of the Parties, the Tribunal arrives finally at the following answer.\n\n209.\n\nThe first point, in the Tribunal's view, is that the breach of the BIT established in paragraph 2 is a single composite breach. Although, as will appear, the breach was the product of more than one item of conduct (action or omission) attributable to the Respondent, they amount in the aggregate to the failure to accord to the investor the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' required under the BIT. There is nothing uncommon in this; on the contrary, it corresponds to the typical case in investment protection, since the entire concept of \u2018treatment' is one that can and often does envisage something in the nature of a course of action. That this was the understanding of the First Tribunal is clear from the language used (\"de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les demanderesses d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable\") and in particular from the words that follow: \"en ce compris celle de s'abstenir de tout d\u00e9ni de justice.\" It is clearer still from the First Tribunal's reasoning in paragraph 623 of its Award: \"[e]n r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la seule qualification susceptible d'\u00eatre retenue serait celle d'un acte composite comprenant une s\u00e9rie d'atteintes au traitement juste et \u00e9quitable de l'investissement des parties demanderesses, r\u00e9sidant essentiellement dans la D\u00e9cision n\u00b043 et le d\u00e9ni de justice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qui lui est li\u00e9 concernant la rotative Goss.\" This establishes plainly, for example, that there was no separate breach consisting of a denial of justice, but that all of the failings identified by the First Tribunal, including the denial ofjustice, amount together, globally, to a failure to accord fair and equitable treatment, and thus constitute a breach of the BIT. It follows that it is this single composite breach which gives rise to the \u2018right to compensation' laid down in paragraph 3.\n\n210.\n\nIt is not in dispute between the Parties that the two passages in which the First Tribunal determines conduct by the Respondent falling short of the requirements of Article 4 of the BIT are to be found at paragraphs 653 - 674 of its First Award. As the *ad hoc* Committee puts the matter in its Decision on Annulment, citing the First Award:\n\n57. Le raisonnement et la conclusion du Tribunal en ce qui concerne la violation par le Chili de l'article 4 de l'API sont bien illustr\u00e9s par les paragraphes suivants de la Sentence. Le Comit\u00e9 les reprend *in extenso* :\n\n653. La question se pose en particulier de savoir si le comportement des autorit\u00e9s chiliennes, l\u00e9gislatives, administratives et judiciaires, peut ou non \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme constituant un \u00ab d\u00e9ni de justice \u00bb et une violation du devoir d'accorder \u00e0 l'investissement \u00e9tranger une protection suffisante, soit plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, un \u00ab traitement juste et \u00e9quitable \u00bb au sens de l'article 4 (1) de l'API ainsi con\u00e7u : \u00ab Chaque Partie garantira dans son territoire, en accord avec sa l\u00e9gislation nationale, un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable aux investissements r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par des investisseurs de l'autre Partie, sous des conditions non moins favorables que pour ses investisseurs nationaux \u00bb.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n658. Dans le contexte sp\u00e9cifique du pr\u00e9sent litige, tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente sentence dans sa partie Faits et dans les consid\u00e9rations juridiques qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, l'application de la notion de \u00ab d\u00e9ni de justice \u00bb et celle de l'obligation de \u00ab traitement juste et \u00e9quitable \u00bb n'appellent pas de longue analyse. Elles se laissent r\u00e9sumer \u00e0 deux questions relativement simples :\n\n\u2022 La premi\u00e8re est celle de savoir si l'absence de toute d\u00e9cision par les juridictions chiliennes pendant une p\u00e9riode de sept ann\u00e9es (1995-2002), d'une part, et l'absence de r\u00e9ponse de la Pr\u00e9sidence aux requ\u00eates de M. Pey Casado, d'autre part, sont constitutives d'un d\u00e9ni de justice.\n\n\u2022 La seconde est celle de savoir si les investissements reconnus par le Tribunal arbitral comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par M. Pey Casado ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9s du \u00ab traitement juste et \u00e9quitable \u00bb prescrit par l'API.\n\n659. Sur la premi\u00e8re question, la r\u00e9ponse ne peut \u00eatre que positive, au regard des faits \u00e9tablis et d\u00e9j\u00e0 retenus par le Tribunal arbitral, l'absence de toute d\u00e9cision par les tribunaux civils chiliens sur les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Pey Casado s'analysant en un d\u00e9ni de justice.\n\n[...]\n\n665. Sur la seconde question, celle de savoir si les investissements des demanderesses ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative s'impose de l'avis du Tribunal arbitral, compte tenu des conclusions auxquelles il est parvenu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment aux termes de son appr\u00e9ciation des preuves et de son analyse juridique. En bref, il s'agit de la conclusion selon laquelle M. Pey Casado a bien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des investissements et \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire de biens meubles ou immeubles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9s par l'autorit\u00e9 militaire chilienne.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n674. Dans le cas d'esp\u00e8ce, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, en accordant des compensations - pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l'avis du Tribunal arbitral, n'\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s, en m\u00eame temps qu'elle paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqu\u00e9s, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a manifestement commis un d\u00e9ni de justice et refus\u00e9 de traiter les demanderesses de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable.\n\n211.\n\nThese paragraphs in the First Award were not annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee and constitute *res judicata*. What the Committee did annul was the defective method by which the First Tribunal arrived at the compensation due for the breach so found. For all that the present Tribunal finds difficulty in extracting precisely what consequences the First Tribunal regarded as flowing from the findings in paragraphs 659, 665, and 674 just cited, it is not empowered or permitted to reopen the matter or to substitute its own conclusions for those of the First Tribunal. Its mandate is limited (see above) to identifying the injury proven to have been caused to the Claimants by the above breach, and then determining the appropriate reparation for it in accordance with international law.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it instructive to begin this process by revisiting the method adopted by the First Tribunal and the reasons why this was annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee. So far as the present Tribunal can judge (drawing also on the Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee), the process followed by the First Tribunal consisted of the following steps:\n\n\u2022 the existence of injury resulting from the original expropriation of the investment required no demonstration, since the Respondent had fixed its quantum in order to award it to persons other than the Claimants;\n\n\u2022 the Claimants had not produced any proof, or at least any convincing proof, of any kind for the existence of damage caused by the facts falling within the competence of the First Tribunal *ratione temporis* ;\n\n\u2022 in the absence of proof, and the unavailability in the circumstances of alternative expert evidence, the First Tribunal was empowered to make its own evaluation by reference to \"objective elements\" given that a quantum had been fixed by the Respondent (see above);\n\n\u2022 this evaluation could not be of the damage suffered by reason of the original expropriation, but had instead to be of the damage resulting from the breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT;\n\n\u2022 the object was to put the Claimants into the position they would have been in if the authorities of the Respondent had compensated the Claimants instead of third persons who (in the judgement of the First Tribunal) were not the owners of the assets in question; and\n\n\u2022 it followed therefore that the amount awarded to these third persons was the correct measure of the damages.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal passes then to the reasons why this analysis was found faulty, and in consequence annulled, by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n214.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee begins by saying that, having reviewed the entire record, it can only conclude that the Parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 of the BIT (the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment). It goes on to conclude that the Parties had no fair opportunity to discuss the remedy for breach of Article 4. This constituted grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The *ad hoc* Committee further expresses its agreement with the Respondent's submission that the First Tribunal ended up, in its own conclusions, going beyond the standard it had itself established, i.e. placing the Claimants in the position they would have been but for the breaches of the BIT, because in fact it left them far better off. It further concludes that when the First Tribunal adopted the expropriation-based calculation of damages used by the Chilean authorities, this contradicted the Tribunal's own determination that this basis of calculation was irrelevant, and that the allegations, discussion and evidence related to such damages could not be considered; this contradiction set up a manifest inconsistency within the terms of the First Tribunal's Award and constituted grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n215.\n\nIt will thus be evident that the First Tribunal's method of arriving at the compensation due for the breach of the BIT was found faulty, and annulled, on two separate grounds, one of procedure and one of substance. The procedural ground was the failure to allow the Parties (and in particular, one must assume, the Respondent) to be heard; the substantial ground was that the method which the First Tribunal decided of its own motion to adopt, in order to remedy the breach, stood in direct contradiction to its findings on the nature of the breach itself. Given that the first of these defects has been expunged in the present resubmission proceedings, by the full and comprehensive opportunities offered to both Claimants and Respondent to advance their arguments on damages as recorded above, the Tribunal will focus its attention on the second, with the essential aim of ensuring that its findings in respect of compensation follow from, and do not contradict, the findings of the First Tribunal on the nature of the breach, as recorded in the First Award. The Tribunal might, in addition, register at this point that there is a further criticism that might potentially have been levelled against the annulled portions of the First Award, namely the way in which they tend to elide the distinction between injury (and the associated question of causation) and the assessment of the compensation due for that injury. As indicated above (see paragraph 204 above), this distinction is fundamental to the operation of Article 31 of the ILC Articles. The point was no doubt irrelevant in the context of the annulment proceedings once the *ad hoc* Committee had in any event determined that the relevant parts of the First Award were to be annulled on other grounds. But it is a point that must stay in the forefront of the present Tribunal's consideration as it approaches the question of compensation afresh, on the basis of the First Tribunal's un-annulled findings in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the *dispositif* of its Award.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal should also interpolate at this point that part of the argument addressed to it by the Claimants in these resubmission proceedings was to the effect that the actions of the Respondent, since the handing down of the First Award, constituted a new denial of justice for which compensation is due, and can be awarded in these resubmission proceedings. This is an argument that the Tribunal must reject outright. The reason is not only that allegations of that kind would have to be subjected to a proper process of evidence and proof before they could properly come to decision in an arbitral process (which indeed they would); it is quite simply that the entire argument falls plainly outside the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal, which (as already indicated) is limited, under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 55 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, exclusively to \u2018the dispute' or such parts of it as remain in being after the annulment. That can only be taken to refer to \u2018the dispute' that had been submitted to arbitration in the first place, the critical date for which was the Claimants' original request for arbitration. Issues arising between the Parties after that date - and still more so issues arising out of post-Award conduct - cannot by any stretch of the imagination fall within the scope of resubmission proceedings under the provisions cited above, and the Tribunal sees no need to say more about the matter in this Award.\n\n217.\n\nTo recapitulate therefore: the assessment of the reparation due under international law for the breach of an international obligation consists of three steps - the establishment of the breach, followed by the ascertainment of the injury caused by the breach, followed by the determination of the appropriate compensation for that injury. The three-stage process can be seen with particular clarity where, as in the present case, the claims are for monetary damages.372 Since the first stage, the establishment of breach, has already been determined with binding effect by the First Award, the Tribunal can begin with the second, the ascertainment of the injury caused by the breach. In doing so, however, it notes that the First Tribunal has established the breach negatively as well as positively. That is to say, it is *res judicata* both (positively) that the breach consists in the composite failure to accord fair and equitable treatment (including the avoidance of denial of justice), and also (negatively) that the expropriation of the original investment is outside the temporal scope of the BIT, so that all evidence and argument related to that expropriation is to be excluded as not relevant to the dispute other than as background facts.\n\nThe First Tribunal recognizes the distinction between the fact of injury and the quantification of damage in paragraph 690 of its Award; see fn. 364 above.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the fact that the injury in question has to be that caused by the specific breach. Causation is of the essence. What must be proven is both the existence of an injury to the claimant and that that particular injury is the sufficiently proximate consequence of the specific breach.373 On the basis of the somewhat incomplete indications which the First Tribunal offers in its Award, the Parties have argued the matter in front of the present Tribunal as follows.\n\nExh. CL49, B. Cheng, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (2nd ed., 1987), pp. 241-253.\n\n219.\n\nFor the Claimants, the argument comes in two alternative versions,374 the first of which separates into two parts. The first part has it that the consequence of the excessive delay in the Goss press proceedings before the Santiago court was that it prevented the Claimants from demonstrating to the First Tribunal that the Decree expropriating the *El Clar\u00edn* investment was absolutely null from the outset (*ex tunc*). Had the Claimants been in a position to do so, the argument continues, they would have been able to convince the First Tribunal that the expropriation was not in fact *un fait consomm\u00e9* in the 1970s, and the First Tribunal would in consequence have decided that there was a continuing expropriation extending beyond the entry into force of the BIT for which the Claimants were indeed entitled to compensation under the BIT.\n\nSee paragraphs 59 ff above\n\n220.\n\nIn its second part, the Claimants' argument is that, had the authorities of the Respondent not insisted on pressing ahead with Decision No. 43 in the domestic restitution proceedings, by which compensation for the expropriation was awarded to other persons while the original arbitration was in train, it would still have been open to the Claimants to avail themselves of other potential remedies under Chilean law; in other words, the injury the Claimants suffered from the discrimination as established by the First Tribunal was the loss of the right to recover, however belatedly, compensation for the expropriation, since the Chilean legal system would not have been able to accommodate the concept of a second compensation for a wrong that had already been compensated once.375\n\nSee paragraph 84 above.\n\n221.\n\nThe alternative argument on behalf of the Claimants is that, whatever the difficulties lying in the way of establishing a directly compensable injury, the loss suffered by the Claimants and the benefit that accrued to the Respondent can be seen as the two sides of a zero-sum game. The consequence would be that the injury to the Claimants and its monetary evaluation are simply established by calculating the enrichment flowing to the Respondent (sc. arising out of the continuing and uncompensated expropriation).376\n\nSee paragraphs 95-96 above.\n\n222.\n\nThe Respondent has interposed a series of objections to these various alternative arguments by the Claimants. At the heart of the Respondent's objections lies the repeated assertion that all of the Claimants' submissions, in one way or another, represent attempts to reinstate their original claim for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*, despite the fact that it was definitively rejected by the First Tribunal as lying outside its jurisdiction under the BIT. In addition, and more specifically, the Respondent contends:\n\n\u2022 that the length of the Goss press case in the Santiago court could not have been the cause of any relevant injury to the Claimants, both because the value of the press became part of the Claimants' expropriation case in the original arbitration, and because the only bearing which the proceedings in that case was asserted to have on the Arbitration was via the Claimants' theory as to the nullity *ex tunc* of Decree No. 165, which leads back in turn to the rejected expropriation claim;\n\n\u2022 that the Claimants likewise suffered no direct, or financially assessable, injury as a result of Decision No. 43, and that such disadvantage as the Claimants suffered was the direct consequence of their own voluntary decision not to participate in the domestic compensation scheme.377\n\nSee paragraph 139 above, and Exh. R-1, Letter from Me Garc\u00e9s to the Chilean Minister of National Assets, 24 June 1999, pp. 3-4, concluding: \"Que eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce qui vient d'\u00eatre dit je vous signifie que la pr\u00e9sente partie ne vas pas invoquer la Loi 19,568.\".\n\n223.\n\nIn order to decide between these competing submissions, the Tribunal needs itself to revisit the First Award, in its annulled as well as its un-annulled portions. The key passages for this purpose are paragraphs 600/610/615; 601-603; 608; 620-623/652; 629/633; 635-636; 645; 658/659/665; 666/669; and 670/674. All of these paragraphs fall within the unannulled portions of the First Award and are thus *res judicata*. The Tribunal takes account as well of paragraphs 675, 677, and 680, which, although they form part of Section VIII of the First Award, and therefore stand annulled, nevertheless illuminate the reasoning of the First Tribunal in the un-annulled portions of its Award.\n\n224.\n\nIn paragraphs 600 and 610, together with paragraph 615, the First Tribunal finds that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* under Decree No. 165 was not a continuing breach and therefore lay outside the protection of the BIT *ratione temporis*, by contrast with Decision No. 43 and the claimed denial of justice, and that \"le fait illicite composite invoqu\u00e9 par les parties demanderesses n'existe pas en l'esp\u00e8ce\"; in paragraphs 601-603, it rejects the argument to the contrary raised by the Claimants on the basis of their claim that Decree No. 165 was invalid *ab initio* and that a decision of the Chilean Supreme Court could be applied by analogy; in paragraph 608, it holds that the expropriation \"\u00e9tait consomm\u00e9e\" on the date of Decree No. 165 \"quelle que soit l'appr\u00e9ciation que l'on peut porter sur sa lic\u00e9it\u00e9\"; in paragraph 620, it holds that the expropriation was not merely \"un fait consomm\u00e9\" but also \"distinct des violations post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'API [=BIT] dont font \u00e9tat les demanderesses\"; in paragraph 621, it decides that the initial refusals of Mr Pey Casado's requests for compensation were not in themselves contrary to the BIT, since the sole right of compensation subsequent to the BIT was that brought into being by the Chilean legislation in 1998. In paragraphs 622-623, the Tribunal holds that Decision No. 43, which had to be understood as a discriminatory application of a post-BIT law and the rights created under that law, was \"une question distincte et non pas.un fait identique \u00e0 l'expropriation susceptible de former l'un des ingr\u00e9dients du fait composite all\u00e9gu\u00e9\" and that the only admissible analysis was that of \"un acte composite comprenant une s\u00e9rie d'atteintes au traitement juste et \u00e9quitable de l'investissement des parties demanderesses, r\u00e9sidant essentiellement dans la D\u00e9cision no 43 et le d\u00e9ni de justice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qui lui est li\u00e9 concernant la rotative Goss\" - this last being complemented by the holding in paragraph 652 that the discrimination alleged under Decision No. 43, as well as the alleged denial of justice, were to be assessed against Article 4 of the BIT, since the application of Articles 3 and 5 was incompatible with the Tribunal's rejection of the \u2018continuing act' thesis.\n\n225.\n\nWhen it moves on, against that background, to assessing the claims that do fall within the scope of the BIT, the First Tribunal decides, in paragraph 629, that the first potential breach concerned the compensation under Decision No. 43 of persons who were not the owners, and in paragraph 633, that the second potential breach concerned the absence of a decision by the Chilean courts on the restitution of the Goss press; in paragraphs 635-636, it notes as matters of fact that the Claimants undertook several attempts, all without success, to establish before the Chilean authorities incompatibilities between Decision No. 43 and the domestic court proceedings over the Goss press; and in paragraph 645, it summarizes the position as being that the Claimants' allegations of \u2018denial of justice' took various forms and had various very different factual bases. The decision therefore reduces itself, so the First Tribunal holds in paragraph 658, to two relatively simple questions, namely whether the absence of a decision from the Chilean courts for a period of seven years, coupled with the lack of response by the Presidency to Mr Pey Casado's requests, constituted a denial of justice, and secondly whether the investments that had been recognized by the First Tribunal as having been made by Mr Pey Casado had enjoyed the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' prescribed by the BIT. To the first of these two questions, the First Tribunal responds, in paragraph 659, that, on the established facts and the legal precedents, the delay of seven years had to be adjudged a denial of justice; and to the second, in paragraph 665, that, given that it had been established that Mr Pey Casado was the owner of the confiscated properties, these investments had not enjoyed fair and equitable treatment; this was on the basis (paragraph 666) that the Chilean authorities were aware of Mr Pey Casado's claims and of a judicial decision recognizing his ownership and that it had never been shown with any degree of credibility (paragraph 669) that his role was limited to that of intermediary or nominee for the true owners; moreover, it was firmly established in international jurisprudence that discriminatory treatment of foreign investors is a breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under bilateral investment treaties.\n\n226.\n\nAnd then finally, against that background, the First Tribunal decides, in paragraph 674,\n\nDans le cas d'esp\u00e8ce, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, en accordant des compensations - pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l'avis du Tribunal arbitral, n'\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s, en m\u00eame temps qu'elle paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqu\u00e9s, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a manifestement commis un d\u00e9ni de justice et refus\u00e9 de traiter les demanderesses de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable.\n\n227.\n\nAll these paragraphs come from the un-annulled part of the First Award. The present\u00a0Tribunal completes this summary of the key passages in the First Award by noting in addition (though on the basis indicated in paragraph 223 above) the First Tribunal's indication (paragraph 675) of its finding that Mr Pey Casado was the owner of the confiscated property, and its indication (paragraph 677) of the recognition by the Chilean State of the illegality of the original confiscation and the accompanying duty to provide compensation, disputing only to whom it should be paid. The Tribunal notes also, though on a somewhat different, and non-factual level, the First Tribunal's holding, in paragraph 680, that the existence of damage \"r\u00e9sultant de la confiscation\" [emphasis added] follows automatically by itself, as well as from the decision (sc. Decision No. 43) to award compensation in favour of other persons.\n\n228.\n\nThe present Tribunal draws the following conclusions from the above, which represent its interpretation of the *res judicata* portions of the First Award for the purposes of carrying out its own mandate of deciding on the \"compensation\" due under paragraph 3 of the dispositif of the First Award for the breach determined in paragraph 2 thereof:\n\na) that the original expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* and the related assets belonging to Mr Pey Casado was consummated in 1975 and consequently lies outside the scope of the BIT; that all arguments based on or arising out of the expropriation may not be taken into consideration, except in so far as they constitute factual background to matters that are properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT; and that the Claimants' theory of a \u2018continuing act' linking post-BIT conduct to pre-BIT conduct must be rejected;\n\nb) that the issues properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT, namely the Claimants' allegations of breach of Article 4 of the BIT (fair and equitable treatment) resulting from the delays in the Goss press litigation and from Decision No. 43, are distinct, both factually and legally, from the original expropriation; and\n\nc) that there was a breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4, which consisted of the totality of the conduct of the Chilean authorities resulting in the seven-year delay in the Goss press litigation and Decision No. 43, and manifested itself in the award of compensation to persons who were not the owners of the assets confiscated while Mr Pey Casado's claims were rejected.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal believes this analysis to be entirely consistent with the findings of the *ad hoc* Committee in its Annulment Decision, notably its paragraph 261, in which the *ad hoc* Committee draws from the First Award the holdings by the First Tribunal that the Claimants' arguments as to damages were strictly limited to ones founded on the expropriation; that these were not relevant to the claims for denial of justice and discrimination; and that the Claimants had not produced any convincing proof of damage in respect of these claims. The same is true of paragraphs 282-285 of the Annulment Decision, in which the *ad hoc* Committee stigmatizes the First Tribunal's use of the amount awarded to the third parties by Decision No. 43 as a contradiction of the reasoning summarized above.\n\n230.\n\nThe consequence of this interpretation of the First Award is, in the opinion of the Tribunal, as follows:\n\na) that, beyond its description, in somewhat Delphic terms, of what constituted the breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment, the First Tribunal made no finding as to what injury was caused to the Claimants by that breach or its constitutive elements;\n\nb) that it remains therefore outstanding to determine the nature and extent of that injury;\n\nc) that, having failed to meet the corresponding burden of proof in the original arbitration, the burden rested with the Claimants to do so now in these resubmission proceedings;\n\nd) that any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.\n\n231.\n\nThe question remaining for the Tribunal, and it is the central question in these resubmission proceedings, is whether, and to what extent, the Claimants have met that burden of proving what injury was caused to either or both of them by the Respondent's breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding assessable damage in financial terms.\n\n**I. Have the Claimants met the Burden of Proving Injury?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nOnce the question is reduced to the terms in the preceding paragraph, it becomes plain that the Claimants have not met this burden; indeed, it could be said that in some senses they have not even set out to do so, in as much as they have focussed their submissions on the evaluation of damage, without undertaking the prior step of showing the precise nature of the injury, causation and damage itself. The Respondent submits that, in truth, if one focusses on the actual breach (and its component parts) established by the First Award, the Claimants have suffered no demonstrable material damage at all. None from the Goss press case, because what was sought in that case was restitution of the press or compensation for its confiscation, which was in due course rolled into the extended version of the Claimants' claims in the original arbitration, and was rejected by the First Tribunal as outside the scope of the BIT; and none from Decision No. 43, because the Claimants could not possibly have benefited from a compensation process in which they had deliberately and explicitly elected not to participate (on account of the fork-in-the-road clause in the BIT). Or the Respondent puts the matter a different way, by submitting that, if the Claimants could be assumed to have suffered some damage, the proximate cause of the damage was the Claimants' own actions, thus breaking the chain of causation required for the award of financial compensation under the ILC's draft Articles 31 and 36.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal finds much merit in the Respondent's submissions. It is not, however, required to pronounce formally on them; given the Claimants' failure to address their own burden of proof, there is no *prima facie* case for the Respondent, as the opposing party, to rebut.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal has therefore no option but to find that the Claimants have failed to prove any material injury caused to either of them as the sufficiently direct result of the Respondent's breach of Article 4 of the BIT. The Tribunal cannot therefore, on principle, make any award of damages.\n\n**J. Have the Claimants Met the Burden of Proving Quantifiable Loss?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nGiven its finding in paragraph 234 above, the Tribunal can dispose of this question shortly by saying that, in the absence of any sufficient proof of injury or damage caused to the Claimants by the breach of the BIT established in the First Award, the question of the assessment or quantification of that damage does not arise. The Tribunal has accordingly no need to analyse in further detail the expert reports of Mr Saura for the Claimants and Mr Kaczmarek for the Respondent, although it would like to register its appreciation for the reports and oral testimony of both expert witnesses, which was of material assistance in clarifying the issues before the Tribunal in these proceedings.378\n\nFor similar reasons, the Tribunal has no reason to pursue further the issue as to taxation reserved as noted in paragraph 117 above.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal adds - though this is necessarily *obiter* - that, had the matter arisen for decision, it would have been disposed to accept the Respondent's objection to the admissibility of all those parts of the Claimants' damages submissions which were based directly or implicitly on the expropriation value of the original investment, as diametrically inconsistent with the *res judicata* portions of the First Award and the Annulment Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n**K. The Unjust Enrichment Claim**\n----------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAs already indicated, the Claimants put forward at various stages of their written argument a claim to monetary compensation based on unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment also features in the expert Report of Mr Saura as an alternative basis for his calculation of damage.\n\n238.\n\nThere are two possible ways of analysing the unjust enrichment claim. One is to regard it as a freestanding claim in its own right. This is how the Tribunal interprets paragraph 380 of the Claimants' Reply, which is based on the simple allegation that, through its possession and use of the confiscated assets, the Respondent has been enriched \u2018sans juste cause' to the detriment of the Claimant investors, which gives rise in and of itself to an obligation to disgorge the assets and the fruits of their use. The Respondent counters that this is tantamount to de-linking the claim from the BIT entirely, since it would result in awarding compensation without any prior finding of breach from which the injury to be compensated flowed. The Respondent adds that this interpretation of the Claimants' argument is shown by the way in which paragraph 380 is expressly linked to the \u2018hypoth\u00e8se' (although it is one the Claimants reject) of the absence of any of the circumstances which generate liability for breach of the BIT.\n\n239.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Respondent is correct on this point. As demonstrated above, the operative finding of liability is already fixed for all purposes by the (un-annulled) paragraph 2 of the *dispositif* of the First Award, and the right to compensation (\u2018droit \u00e0 compensation') specified in paragraph 3 can only properly be understood as referring to compensation for the injury suffered from the breach identified in paragraph 2. This reading of these two paragraphs - both of them *res judicata* - is what logic demands; and it is also consistent with the entire tenor both of the First Tribunal's own assessment of compensation that follows, and of the *ad hoc* Committee's criticism of that assessment in its Decision. This version of the unjust enrichment claim must therefore be rejected.\n\n240.\n\nThe alternative way of looking at the unjust enrichment claim would be to regard it as no more than a method, a technique, for arriving at an acceptable quantification of a right to compensation established by other means. This corresponds, as the Tribunal understands it, to the methods through which Mr Saura conceived the calculations contained in his Report. Expert valuations of damage are, however, essentially secondary, or derivative; it is not simply a question of whether the calculation correctly values what it sets out to measure, but also (at the primary level) whether it is setting out to measure the right thing. The Respondent is critical of Mr Saura's calculations at both the primary and the secondary level. Specifically, the Respondent contends that, whatever the merits or demerits of Mr Saura's particular calculations, they all fall at the hurdle that they are nothing more than alternative approaches to measuring the capital value of the confiscated assets and the profits from their use, which would only be admissible in the presence of a valid expropriation claim.379 Once again, the Tribunal accepts this criticism. A claim for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* and associated assets is precluded, with the effect of *res judicata*, by the First Award and the Decision on Annulment; the only compensation open to be awarded in these resubmission proceedings is for the particular breaches established by paragraph 2 of the *dispositif* of the First Award which, as the Tribunal has concluded above380 may not be used as a cloak for reintroducing under another guise the precluded expropriation claim.\n\nSee paragraph 164 above.\n\nAt paragraph 230.\n\n**L. The Moral Damage Claim**\n-----------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn addition to the claim for compensation for material damage, the Claimants put forward in these proceedings, as in the original proceedings before the First Tribunal, a claim to moral damages on behalf of Mr Pey Casado and separately of the Foundation. The claim was absent from the request for resubmission, but in the subsequent procedure appeared as follows.\n\n242.\n\nIn the Claimants' Memorial, the claim was linked to Mr Pey Casado's treatment at the time of the *coup d'\u00e9tat*, his exile abroad, and a subsequent campaign of denigration; it was linked also to the Respondent's conduct in the original arbitration and subsequently.381 The claim is repeated in the Reply, with additional authority on the question of proof, and a final suggestion that, if the Tribunal was not ready to grant compensation for moral damage, it should at least bring the corresponding facts into play in order to enhance the amount of the assessed material and financial damage.382 These submissions were developed to a limited extent during the oral hearing.\n\nSee paragraph 76 above.\n\nCR, paras. 476-488.\n\n243.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, two facts stand out from this summary account. The first is that no attempt was made to advance, or to justify, a specific claim that moral damage had been suffered by the Foundation; this claim can therefore immediately be set aside, without any further investigation as to whether moral damages are in fact available to corporate or like entities, as opposed to natural persons. The second is that the claim to damage caused by the Respondent's conduct in the arbitral proceedings must also fall *in limine*, for the reasons given in paragraph 216 above. But the most decisive factor of all is that a claim to damages of a moral character does not escape the burden of proof resting on a claimant, as described in paragraphs 205-206 above. The Tribunal notes, in this context, the clear expression of view by the First Tribunal on two occasions, at paragraphs 689 and 704 of the First Award, that the Claimants had simply failed to meet this burden, and that a mere likelihood that damage might have been suffered does not suffice. Admittedly, both paragraphs fall within Section VIII of the First Award, but, as they relate to matters of factual evidence and proof, they are not tainted by the criticisms of the *ad hoc* Committee relating to the assessment of material damages; and they accord, moreover, entirely with the opinion of the present Tribunal on the basis of the written and oral submissions made to it by the Claimants. The claim to moral damages must therefore be rejected. Had the Tribunal found the claim to material damage to have been established, it would have been prepared to consider the Claimants' subsidiary and alternative submission that moral injury (assuming it to be made out) was a factor to be taken into account in assessing the appropriate reparation for the breach of fair and equitable treatment; but, as the claim to material damages has itself been rejected, this submission, too, must fail.\n\n**M. The Options Open to the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal regrets that the Claimants did not set themselves to the specific task of showing what particular injury and damage could be proved to have been caused to them by the breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4 of the BIT determined in the First Award, which the First Tribunal had also established was legally and factually distinct from the original expropriation claim that had been dismissed *ratione temporis*. The present resubmission proceedings, which were thorough and complete, allowed the Claimants the fullest opportunity to do so, an opportunity of which they did not avail themselves. Given the seniority, skill and experience of Claimants' counsel and their long familiarity with the case, together with the unambiguous and repeated arguments on want of proof advanced by the Respondent, this omission cannot be regarded as inadvertent. The Tribunal has given anxious consideration to the options open to it in these circumstances. Despite the difficulties in understanding some parts of the First Award, the Tribunal could plainly not permit the original expropriation claim to be reintroduced by the back door in the guise of a breach of fair and equitable treatment suffered many years later; this was not justifiable on the facts or the law, and was in any case formally excluded by the combined effect of the First Award and the Annulment Decision. The Tribunal could equally not have devised a theory of damages of its own, separate from the arguments of the Parties; this is what the First Tribunal had done, and for which it was rightly overruled by the *ad hoc* Committee in the annulment proceedings. Nor could the Tribunal have awarded moral damages as a form of consolation where actual damages had not been proved. Nor, finally (as already indicated in paragraph 172 above), was the Tribunal empowered to decide the Claimants' claims *ex aequo et bono*. There was thus no other course open to it than to dismiss, virtually in their entirety, the Claimants' monetary claims. In doing so, it wishes however to make the following observation. The Tribunal's Award does not touch the finding in the First Award that the Respondent had committed a breach of Article 4 of the BIT by failing to guarantee fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments, including a denial of justice; that finding is *res judicata* and was not part of the present resubmission proceedings. It thus represents a subsisting obligation on the Respondent and one which, as the First Tribunal found, arose out of a failure in the operation of the Chilean internal system for the redress of acknowledged past injustices. The Tribunal has no doubt that, these resubmission proceedings once out of the way, the Respondent will remain conscious of that obligation, and will weigh its consequences appropriately.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Cost Submissions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants request from the Tribunal:\n\nQu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 supporter l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des frais de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, y compris les frais et honoraires des Membres du Tribunal, les frais de proc\u00e9dure (utilisation des installations, frais de traduction, etc.) et, en cons\u00e9quence, qu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 rembourser, dans les 90 jours qui suivent l'envoi de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir, les parties Demanderesses les frais et co\u00fbts de proc\u00e9dure avanc\u00e9s par elles et qu'il rembourse aux parties Demanderesses l'ensemble des frais et honoraires des avocats, experts et autres personnes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 intervenir pour la d\u00e9fense de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, portant, en cas de non remboursement dans ce d\u00e9lai, int\u00e9r\u00eats capitalis\u00e9s mensuellement \u00e0 un taux de 10% \u00e0 compter de la date de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir jusqu'\u00e0 complet paiement, ou \u00e0 toutes autres sommes que le Tribunal arbitral estimera justes et \u00e9quitables.383\n\nCR, para. 501(9).\n\n246.\n\nIn their Statement of Costs dated 18 May 2015 and Supplemental Statement of Costs dated 29 May 2015, the Claimants have submitted the following claims:\n\nEn cons\u00e9quence, et conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 501 (9) du M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique des Demanderesses du 9 janvier 2015, les parties Demanderesses sollicitent du Tribunal arbitral qu'il condamne la R\u00e9publique du Chili \u00e0 leur verser sur le compte bancaire de la Fondation demanderesse indiqu\u00e9e par celle-ci, dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la reddition de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir, le montant de :\n\n(1) 3,159,743.24 euros (T.V.A. 21 % comprise) correspondant aux frais et honoraires du Cabinet Garc\u00e9s y Prada, Abogados;\n\n(2) 1,132,231.59 euros correspondants aux frais et honoraires du Cabinet Gide Loyrette Nouel ;\n\n(3) 241,159.77 euros correspondant aux frais et honoraires du Cabinet Accuracy;\n\n(4) 1,692 dollars US correspondant aux frais et honoraires du Cabinet d'experts Aninat, de Santiago du Chili\n\n(5) 33,332.19 euros de frais de traduction\n\n(6) l'ensemble des sommes pay\u00e9es au Centre par les parties Demanderesses dans le cadre de la nouvelle soumission concernant l'affaire No. ARB-98-2 telle qu'elles seront \u00e9tablies par le Centre ;\n\n(7) ou \u00e0 toute autre somme que le Tribunal arbitral jugera \u00e9quitable ;\n\n(8) rejette les demandes de la R\u00e9publique du Chili au titre du remboursement de ses d\u00e9penses et frais.\n\nLes Parties Demanderesses sollicitent du Tribunal qu'il ordonne qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement de ces sommes par la R\u00e9publique du Chili dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9, ces sommes porteront int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 un taux de 10%, capitalis\u00e9s mensuellement, \u00e0 compter de la date de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir, jusqu'\u00e0 complet paiement.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent contends that :\n\nClaimants' consistent pattern of accusing Chile's counsel of bad faith at every turn; making such accusations public by uploading all of their pleadings and most of their correspondence on their website; belaboring every procedural point; appealing every issue (*see, e.g.,* Claimants' 10 submissions on Chile's arbitrator appointment) have all acutely exacerbated the dispute and have implied a massive waste of time and resources. As a result of Claimants' vexatious litigation tactics, and the fact that the entirety of Claimants' Resubmission claims are impermissible in the first place, the Tribunal should impose on Claimants the obligation to cover all of Chile's costs and expenses, including legal and expert fees. It would certainly seem inappropriate\u2014 in light of the foregoing discussion \u2014 to award costs to Claimants, as they have requested.384\n\n[...]\n\nFor the reasons set forth in this Rejoinder, as well as those articulated in the Counter-Memorial, Chile respectfully requests that the Tribunal:\n\n[\u2026]\n\nb. Particularly in light of Claimants' vexatious tactics, misleading and repetitive argumentation, and defamatory accusations, grant Chile a full award of any and all expenses and costs incurred during this Resubmission Proceeding (including legal fees and expert fees);385\n\nRR, para. 185.\n\nRR, para. 189(b).\n\n248.\n\nIn its Costs Quantification dated 29 May 2015, the Respondent has submitted the following claims:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **COST CATEGORY** | **TOTAL IN US DOLLARS** | **TOTAL IN CHILEAN PESOS1** |\n| Arnold & Porter (Fees and Costs) | 3,093,589.76 | 1,921,119.240.96 |\n| Navigant Consulting (Fees and Costs) | 432,352.94 | 268,491,175.74 |\n| Rodina S.A (Expert Fees for Marcos Libedinsky Tschorne) | 51,093.08 | 31,728,800.00 |\n| ICSID Costs (Advance Fees) | 275,000.00 | 170,775,000.00 |\n| Republic of Chile Administrative Costs (e g, photocopying, scanning, courier and banking costs) | 918.78 | 570,560.00 |\n| Republic of Chile Travel Expenses (e g., airfare, local transport, lodging, meals) | 66,933.00 | 41,565,393.00 |\n| **TOTAL** | **USD 3,919,887.56** | **CLP 2,434,250,169.70** |\n\nThe exchange rate, which was used to convert each respective category of cost, is 1 USD = 621 CLP\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, as a general principle, a successful litigant, whether claimant or respondent, ought to be protected against the cost and expense of having to litigate. The principle conduces to economy and efficiency, and is as applicable to investment arbitration as to other forms of litigation. The Tribunal notes in this context that the First Tribunal took a similar view, and ordered the Respondent to make a contribution to the costs of the Claimants, while also deciding on an unequal division of the costs of the arbitration in favour of the Claimants.\n\n250.\n\nThe present proceedings, being resubmission proceedings, are somewhat out of the ordinary run of ICSID arbitrations. They are also rather complex in their outcome, when taken together with the original proceedings. It is nevertheless the case that, in the resubmission, the Respondent was plainly the successful party overall and the Claimants the losing party overall. This would under normal circumstances have justified an order for substantial costs in favour of the Respondent. That would have derived in particular from the consequences that flowed from the Claimants' reluctance to deviate from the claims they had originally put to the First Tribunal (even where those claims were not upheld in the First Award or were not treated with approval in the Decision on Annulment) and the Claimants' consequent unwillingness to bring their attention to bear instead on isolating, proving and quantifying a claim to injury and damage focussing specifically on the breach of the BIT that had been decided by the First Tribunal. Against this must however be set against the fact that, following the partial annulment, the Claimants had good reason to bring the resubmission proceedings as such, as well as the fact that the ambiguities and uncertainties remaining even in those parts of the First Award that had not been annulled created real difficulties for both Claimants and Respondent in handling the proceedings.\n\n251.\n\nIn these very particular circumstances, the Tribunal proposes to make full use of the discretion left to it under ICSID Convention Article 61(2) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47 and orders that the arbitration costs of the proceedings will be borne by the Parties in similar, but opposite proportions to those decided by the First Tribunal, i.e. three quarters of the total amount to be borne by the Claimants and the remaining one quarter by the Respondent. It will make no further order as to costs; with the result that each side will bear in full its own legal costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel, witnesses and experts).\n\n252.\n\nThe arbitration costs of the proceedings include: (i) the fees and expenses of each Member of the Tribunal and the President of the Tribunal's Assistant; (ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as court reporting, interpretation, the charges of the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London for hosting the hearing on 13 to 16 August 2015, and courier services, as well as estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award; and (iii) ICSID's administrative fees.\n\n253.\n\nThese costs amount to (in US$):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |\n| Sir Franklin Berman QC | 157,440.24 |\n| Mr V. V. Veeder | 40,559.50 |\n| Mr Alexis Mourre | 92,720.20 |\n| President of the Tribunal's Assistant's fees and expenses | 57,242.16 |\n| Other direct expenses (estimated) | 194,075.65 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 96,000.00 |\n| **Total** | **638,037.75** |\n\n254.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the parties in equal parts. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed financial statement; any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in equal shares.\n\n255.\n\nIn consequence of paragraphs 251 to 254 above, the respective shares to be borne by the Parties in the direct costs of the proceeding amount to US$478,528.29 for the Claimants, US$159,509.43 for the Respondent, and the Claimants are accordingly under an obligation to reimburse to the Respondent the amount of US$159,509.43.386\n\nThis amount includes an estimate of the other direct expenses as indicated at paras. 252 and 253 above.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n256.\n\nOn the basis of the reasoning above, the Tribunal decides, unanimously:\n\n1) That Ms Coral Pey Grebe cannot be regarded as a claimant in her own right in these resubmission proceedings;\n\n2) That, as has already been indicated by the First Tribunal, its formal recognition of the Claimants' rights and its finding that they were the victims of a denial of justice constitutes in itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the Respondent's breach of Article 4 of the BIT;387\n\n3) That the Claimants, bearing the relevant burden of proof, have failed to prove any further quantifiable injury to themselves caused by the breach of Article 4 as found by the First Tribunal in its Award;\n\n4) That the Tribunal cannot therefore make any award to the Claimants of financial compensation on this account;\n\n5) That the Claimants' subsidiary claim on the basis of unjust enrichment is without legal foundation;\n\n6) That there are no grounds in the circumstances of the case for the award of moral damages either to Mr Pey Casado or to the Foundation;\n\n7) That the arbitration costs of these resubmission proceedings are to be shared in the proportion of three quarters to be borne by the Claimants and one quarter by the Respondent, with the result that the Claimants shall reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$159,509.43;\n\n8) That all other claims are dismissed.\n\nExh. R-27, First Award, May 8, 2008, para. 704: \". le Tribunal arbitral estime que le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente sentence, notamment par sa reconnaissance des droits des demanderesses et du d\u00e9ni de justice dont elles furent victimes, constitue en soi une satisfaction morale substantielle et suffisante.\""}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr V.V.

Veeder QC\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 June 2013, Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende (the **\"Claimants\")** submitted a Request for Resubmission of their dispute against the Republic of Chile **(\"Chile\"** or **\"Respondent\")** to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\").1**\n\nThe Request for Resubmission followed the partial annulment, on 18 December 2012, of the initial award rendered in this case on 8 May 2008\n\n2.\n\nOn 8 July 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Resubmission pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States **(\"ICSID Convention\"),** and Rule 55(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"****).**\n\n3.\n\nOn 24 December 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1). Mr. Paul Jean Le Cannu, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, was subsequently designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal in the stead of Mr. Le Cannu.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal was composed of Sir Franklin Berman QC, a national of the United Kingdom, President, appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Professor Philippe Sands QC, a national of France and the United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal was reconstituted on 31 January 2014, following the resignation of Professor Philippe Sands QC. The Claimants appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder QC to replace Professor Sands QC. The Parties received copies of the *curricula vitae* and declarations of each member of the Tribunal upon acceptance of their appointment. The *curricula vitae* of Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC indicated that they are members of Essex Court Chambers.\n\n6.\n\nOn 11 March 2014, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties. During the first session, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the Tribunal closed the proceeding and on 13 September 2016, the Tribunal rendered its Award (the **\"Award\").**\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 20 September 2016 addressed to the Secretary-General of ICSID, the Claimants requested that Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC make a number of disclosures concerning the relationship between their chambers -- Essex Court Chambers -and the Republic of Chile.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 9 October 2016 addressed to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID and the Secretary-General of ICSID, the Claimants requested that the Secretary-General confirm whether the Republic of Chile had complied with its obligation to disclose its relationship with Essex Court Chambers during the resubmission proceeding. The Claimants requested that the Republic of Chile make full disclosure before 17 October 2016.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 12 October 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID advised that Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC had each confirmed that no circumstance had arisen during the resubmission proceeding that required disclosure under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n11.\n\nBy a second letter dated 12 October 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID replied to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 9 October 2016 and confirmed that all correspondence received from the Respondent in the resubmission proceeding had been transmitted to the Claimants and the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 13 October 2016 addressed to Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC, the Claimants advised that after the issuance of the Award, they had learned of the existence of a professional relationship between members of Essex Court Chambers and the Republic of Chile during the resubmission proceeding. The Claimants requested that Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC inquire into and make disclosures concerning this relationship so the Claimants could assess whether a legitimate doubt existed as to the impartiality and independence of the arbitrators.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 17 October 2016, Sir Franklin Berman QC replied to Counsel for the Claimants as follows:\n\n*Dear Me Garc\u00e8s,*\n\n*You wrote on 13 October posing a long series of questions to me in my capacity as President of the Resubmission Tribunal in the dispute between Mr Victor Pey Casado and others and the Republic of Chile. With the delivery of its Award last month, the Tribunal completed the task conferred on it. It has not subsequently been called into being for any other purpose under the ICSID Arbitration Rules. I am nevertheless responding to your letter in the same spirit of friendly courtesy as has characterized the conduct of the resubmission proceedings.*\n\n*The Secretary-General of ICSID has, so I understand, already replied to an earlier letter from you, after consultation with me, to convey my confirmation that there was nothing subsequent to my appointment as presiding arbitrator that had called for any supplementary declaration by me under the Arbitration Rules.*\n\n*You are, l am sure, aware that an English barristers' chambers is not a law firm, and that all barristers in chambers operate in strict independence of one another, with the sole exception of the circumstance in which more than one of them is retained by the same client to act in the same matter. I would not therefore in any case be able to answer your questions, as the governing rules impose on each barrister the strictest confidence over the affairs of his clients, so that it would be prohibited for me to make enquiries of fellow members of chambers about the work undertaken by them.*\n\n*I hope that it is not necessary for me to add that at no stage during the resubmission proceedings have I had any discussion of any kind about the case other than with my co-arbitrators, the Secretary to the Resubmission Tribunal, and Dr Gleider Hernandez, the Tribunal's assistant. I would have been deeply distressed had you thought otherwise.*\n\n*With kind and collegial regards,*\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 17 October 2016, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC replied to Counsel for the Claimants as follows:\n\n*Cher M. Garc\u00e8s,*\n\n*Je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 : (i) votre lettre du 20 septembre 2016 (adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme la Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du CIRDI) ; (ii) votre lettre du 13 octobre 2016 (adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Sir Frank Berman et moi-m\u00eame) ; et (iii) la lettre du 12 octobre 2016 de Mme la Secr\u00e9taire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (adress\u00e9e \u00e0 vous-m\u00eame).*\n\n*Je confirme ce que Mme la Secr\u00e9taire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale vous a \u00e9crit dans sa lettre : \u00e0 ma connaissance, aucune circonstance n'est survenue, depuis ma d\u00e9claration du 31 janvier 2014 jusqu'\u00e0 la sentence du 13 septembre 2016, justifiant d'\u00eatre notifi\u00e9e en application de l'article 6(2) du R\u00e8glement d'arbitrage du CIRDI.*\n\n*Je confirme, aussi, que je n'ai eu aucune relation professionnelle d'affaires ou autre avec les parties dans cet arbitrage.*\n\n*Si je comprends bien les questions que vous m'avez pos\u00e9es dans votre seconde lettre, vous demandez des informations confidentielles concernant d'autres barristers exer\u00e7ant leurs professions d'avocats au sein de Essex Court Chambers.*\n\n*Etant donn\u00e9 que tous les barristers de Essex Court Chambers (comme d'autres chambers en Angleterre et au Pays de Galles) exercent \u00e0 titre individuel et ne constituent donc pas une \u00ab law firm \u00bb, un \u00ab partnership \u00bb ou une \u00ab company \u00bb, je regrette de ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de vous r\u00e9pondre. D'apr\u00e8s le Code of Conduct du Bar Standards Board, chaque barrister est ind\u00e9pendant et \u00ab must keep the affairs of each client confidential \u00bb (Core Duty 6). En bref, ces informations confidentielles, quelles qu'elles soient, ne peuvent \u00eatre ni ne sont connues de moi.*\n\n*Je vous prie d'agr\u00e9er, mon cher confr\u00e8re, l'expression de mes salutations distingu\u00e9es.*\n\n*V. V. Veeder QC*\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 18 October 2016, the Claimants notified ICSID of two alleged errors in the Award, and asked the Tribunal to make the previously requested disclosures and to hear the Parties regarding the alleged conflict of interest arising from the relationship between the Respondent and Essex Court Chambers.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 20 October 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID reminded the Claimants that no proceeding had been initiated under Articles 49, 50 or 51 of the ICSID Convention and therefore the requests addressed to the Tribunal by the Claimants in their letter dated 18 October 2016 could not be transmitted to it.\n\n17.\n\nOn 27 October 2016, the Claimants submitted a Request for Rectification of the Award pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention. The Request for Rectification reiterated the request for inquiry and disclosure by Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC. The Claimants asked them to resign from the rectification tribunal should they not make such inquiry and disclosure.\n\n18.\n\nThe Request for Rectification further requested that the rectification proceeding be suspended until the tribunal called upon to interpret the initial award of 8 May 2008 had issued its interpretation decision.\n\n19.\n\nBy email dated 4 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Secretary-General of ICSID for four weeks to file its response regarding the proper procedure to follow in the circumstances presented by the Claimants\u2019 submissions.\n\n20.\n\nBy email dated 5 November 2016, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request for a four-week time limit.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Rectification of the Award. By letter of the same day, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID invited the Parties to submit their requests regarding the procedure, conduct and timetable of the rectification proceedings to the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 10 November 2016, the Claimants submitted requests for suspension of the rectification proceeding and for further disclosure by the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 16 November 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to indicate by 30 November 2016 whether it consented to the requested rectifications.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 17 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to order the Claimants to submit a Spanish translation of the Request for Rectification.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 21 November 2016, the Tribunal indicated that Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC had nothing further to add to their previous correspondence.\n\n26.\n\nBy a second letter dated 21 November 2016, the Tribunal denied the Claimants\u2019 request to suspend the rectification proceeding, and set the procedural timetable for the rectification proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nOn 22 November 2016, the Claimants proposed the disqualification of Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC (the **\"Challenged Arbitrators\")** in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the **\"Proposal\").**\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 29 November 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that the rectification proceeding was suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Proposal.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated 2 December 2016, the Respondent requested an amendment of the procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 submissions. By letter dated 4 December 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that the procedural calendar had been amended as requested.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 4 December 2016, Sir Franklin Berman QC submitted his explanations concerning the Proposal. The letter read:\n\n*Dear Dr Kim,*\n\n*I have been informed by the Secretary-General that a proposal has been lodged for my disqualification as an arbitrator in respect of the ancillary proceedings in relation to the resubmission, following a partial annulment, of the dispute between Mr Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation President Allende and the Republic of Chile (ARB/98/2). As you know, the resubmission tribunal, over which I presided, completed its mandate with the issue of its award on 13 September 2016, but was subsequently called back into being on a request for rectification of that award.*\n\n*In order not to impose any unnecessary delay in your consideration of the matter, I write to say at once that there is nothing I wish to say, or need to say, on the substance of the proposal for my disqualification; I am content for you to decide the matter on the record as it stands, though I naturally stand ready to answer any questions you may wish to put to me.*\n\n*In saying this, I wish merely to draw attention to certain aspects of the record: -*\n\n*1) It is not correct to say that I declined to make disclosure. The request was originally put to me through the Secretary-General, and my reply was promptly conveyed, through the Secretary-General, that disclosure had been made in the standard terms at the time of my appointment, and that nothing had happened since then to call for further disclosure. I drew attention to this in my letter to counsel for the claimants. When counsel subsequently wrote to me direct to convey his personal esteem and admiration, I understood this to mean that he recognized that there could be no objection to the impartiality and independence with which I had carried out my functions in the case. Both letters are attached for ease of reference.*\n\n*2) I note that the disqualification proposal bases itself on a professional engagement said to have been made by the respondent state with a fellow member of my Chambers a short while before the issue of the resubmission award, a matter of which I was entirely unaware (nor could I have been aware of it) until it was raised by counsel some weeks after the resubmission award had issued.*\n\n*3) I note finally a suggestion in the papers that the resubmission tribunal had pressed ahead with the rectification proceedings in undue haste, and attach therefore, for completeness sake, a copy of the Centre's letter to the parties which sets out the schedule laid down by the tribunal under Arbitration Rule 49(3).*\n\n31.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, the Claimants submitted a Spanish version of their Proposal.\n\n32.\n\nBy email dated 11 December 2016, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC submitted his explanations concerning the Proposal. The email read:\n\n*Dear Mr Garel (as Secretary to the Tribunal),*\n\n*I refer to the timetable established by the ICSID Secretariat\u2019s second letter dated 29 November 2016 under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), whereby I am invited to respond in writing to the formal challenge made by the Claimants to my independence as a co-arbitrator (nominated by the Claimants in this arbitration), within the meaning of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n*Save for one matter, I think it inappropriate here to add to the written response made by my letter dated 17 October 2016 addressed to the Claimants\u2019 counsel (copied to the Parties), the contents of which I here confirm (a copy is attached; it is also Pi\u00e8ce 16 to the Claimants\u2019 formal challenge of 22 November 2016).*\n\n*That matter relates to my voluntary resignation in 2007 as the presiding arbitrator in the ICSID arbitration, Vanessa Ventures v Venezuela (ICSID Case No ARB/05/24). The Claimants\u2019 counsel (who was not personally involved) has misunderstood the relevant circumstances in that case, citing it several times in support of the Claimants\u2019 challenge (e.g. see paragraph 39 of the Claimants\u2019 said challenge and Pi\u00e8ces 1, 4, 10, 12, 13 & 17).*\n\n*I resigned in that ICSID arbitration because I learnt at the jurisdictional hearing, for the first time, that one of the counsel acting for the claimant (Vanessa Ventures) was an English barrister who was, at that time, also cocounsel with me acting for a different party in a different and unrelated ICSID Case. I did not resign because he and I were both members of the same barristers\u2019 chambers. Before the jurisdictional hearing, I did not know that this counsel was acting for Vanessa Ventures; nor could have I taken any legitimate steps by myself to check for any such conflict owing to the confidential nature of every English barrister\u2019s professional practice.*\n\n*The circumstances in Vanessa Ventures related to an actual conflict caused by counsel within the same arbitration and not to counsel extraneous to the arbitration. To my understanding, the former circumstances are not present in this case (nor so alleged by the Claimants).*\n\n*Yours Sincerely,*\n\n*V. V. Veeder QC*\n\n33.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, the Respondent submitted its response to the Proposal (the **\"Response\").**\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 30 December 2016, the Claimants asked ICSID to transmit to them certain documents relating to the resignation of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC in the *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Venezuela* case (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, to allow the Claimants to assess the validity of the explanations provided by Mr. V.V. Veeder QC.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated 1 January 2017, ICSID informed the Parties that case documents other than those published on the ICSID website are not public and cannot be disclosed by the Centre.\n\n36.\n\nBy email dated 13 January 2017, the Claimants asked that ICSID seek the approval of the parties in the *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Venezuela* case to disclose the documents referred to in their letter dated 30 December 2016.\n\n37.\n\nOn 13 January 2017, the Claimants submitted further observations regarding the Proposal (the **\"Observations\").**\n\n38.\n\nBy email dated 18 January 2017, ICSID invited the Claimants to contact the parties in the *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Venezuela* case directly.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated 27 January 2017, the Claimants informed ICSID that they invited the parties in the *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Venezuela* case to provide the relevant documents to the Secretary of the Tribunal. The Claimants also requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council be allowed to review the documents in question *in camera,* should either party refuse to disclose these documents to the Claimants.\n\n**II. PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 arguments were set forth in their Proposal of 22 November 2016 and their Observations of 13 January 2017. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**1) The Appearance of a Conflict of Interest**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants submit that on 18 September 2016, two days after the Award was rendered, the Respondent publicly revealed in the Chilean press that Professor Alan Boyle and Mr. Samuel Wordsworth QC, two barristers member of Essex Court Chambers, were representing Chile in cases before the International Court of Justice **(\"ICJ\").2**\n\nProposal, paras. 8-9.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this fact could create an apparent conflict of interest arising from the relationship between the Respondent, Essex Court Chambers and the Challenged Arbitrators, who are also members of these chambers.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants submit that: (i) the Republic of Chile is one of the most important clients of Essex Court Chambers, which is paid to provide legal advice and representation in relation to matters of strategic importance; (ii) the Respondent has a financial interest in seeing the remedies available to the Claimants under Articles 49, 50 and 51 of the ICSID Convention decided in its favor; (iii) the circumstances establish that Essex Court Chambers has an interest in the success of its client, the Republic of Chile; (iv) the Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 explanations did not comply with the standards for conflicts of interest applied by English courts and were designed to maintain the lack of transparency and impropriety of the Chile-Essex Court Chambers relationship; and (v) the refusal to make the requested disclosure breached ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).3\n\nObservations, paras. 111-118.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants assert that an appearance of conflict was exacerbated by the refusal of the Challenged Arbitrators to make the requested disclosure of the relationship between their chambers and the Respondent. They contend that the Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 responses to the request for disclosure demonstrate that they were not transparent about such a relationship.4\n\nProposal, paras. 10-15.\n\n**a) English Law**\n------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 refusal to disclose information about the relationship between the Respondent and other barristers in their chambers is not justified under English law.5\n\nProposal, paras. 8-26.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants rely on a decision from the High Court of England and Wales dated 2 March 2016, which they allege dealt with similar circumstances and where the barrister made disclosures.6\n\nProposal, paras. 17-21.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the Informational Note Regarding Barristers in International Arbitration issued by the Bar Council of England and Wales, which refers to the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration 2014 **(\"IBA Guidelines\").** For the Claimants, the position of the Bar Council of England and Wales contradicts the position of the Challenged Arbitrators regarding their inability to reveal any links between members of their chambers and the Respondent.7\n\nProposal, para. 22.\n\n**b) IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants state that the IBA Guidelines are applicable in this case, and argue that the Respondent has accepted this by previously invoking the Guidelines in these proceedings.8 They add that the Secretary-General of ICSID previously applied the IBA Guidelines in this case.\n\nProposal, paras. 56-58\n\n49.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, under the IBA Guidelines, a conflict may arise on the basis of an appearance, rather than actual, partiality and dependence.9\n\nProposal, paras. 43-51.\n\n50.\n\nThey cite a passage from the IBA Guidelines, which states that, \"*Although barristers\u2019 chambers should not be equated with law firms for the purposes of conflicts, and no general standard is proffered for barristers\u2019 chambers, disclosure may be warranted in view of the relationships among barristers, parties or counsel.\"10* In this respect, the Claimants submit that the Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 membership in Essex Court Chambers creates a \"NonWaivable Red List\" type of conflict, which the IBA Guidelines describe as follows: *\"1.4 The arbitrator or his or her firm regularly advises the party, or an affiliate of the party, and the arbitrator or his or her firm derives significant financial income therefrom.11*\n\nProposal, para. 23.\n\nProposal, paras. 24-25.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Challenged Arbitrators had a duty to investigate possible conflicts of interests under the IBA Guidelines, and to disclose them to the Parties. Yet, the Claimants add, the Challenged Arbitrators exempted themselves from this duty in their letters dated 17 October 2016.12 This, the Claimants argue, went against the principle of *nemo iudex ese debet in causa sua.*\n\nProposal, paras. 60-64\n\n52.\n\nUnder the IBA Guidelines, the Challenged Arbitrators should not have accepted their appointment or should have resigned if they could not make a disclosure because of professional secrecy or confidentiality rules.13\n\nProposal, paras. 65-68.\n\n**c) ICSID Convention and Case Law**\n------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants assert that failure to disclose the Essex Court Chambers-Chile relationship is incompatible with the ICSID arbitration system, which requires arbitrators to be independent and impartial, to judge equitably, and to continuously disclose any relationship or circumstance that would cause their reliability for independent judgement to be questioned.14\n\nProposal, paras. 27-33.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants cite the decision on disqualification in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* which held that an arbitrator could not be expected to maintain a Chinese wall in his own mind. The Claimants argue that the Challenged Arbitrators seem to be relying on the existence of a Chinese wall to refuse to make the requested disclosure.15\n\nProposal, para. 34, citing *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No ARB/13/13), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Mr. Bruno Boesch, 20 March 2014.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants further rely on the decision on disqualification in *Lemire v. Ukraine* in which an arbitrator disclosed that his firm had received instructions from the respondent regarding an ICJ case and offered to resign. They note that the Challenged Arbitrators have not made any disclosure and refused to resign in this case.16\n\nProposal, para. 35.\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the response of the Challenged Arbitrators in their letters of 17 October 2016 contradicts the ruling of the tribunal in *Hrvatska v. Slovenia,* which stated that :\n\n*For an international system like that of ICSID, it seems unacceptable for the solution to reside in the individual national bodies which regulate the work of professional service providers, because that might lead to inconsistent or indeed arbitrary outcomes depending on the attitudes of such bodies, or the content (or lack of relevant content) of their rules. It would moreover be disruptive to interrupt international cases to ascertain the position taken by such bodies. (...).*17\n\nProposal, para. 38.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the conduct of the Challenged Arbitrators in this proceeding contradicts the conduct of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC in the *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela* case, where Mr. V.V. Veeder QC resigned as president of a tribunal because a member of his chambers acted as counsel for the claimant in the same case.18\n\nProposal, paras. 39-40.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the IBA Guidelines apply to all arbitrators in ICSID cases, regardless of their experience and reputation.19\n\nProposal, paras. 43-51.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants argue that arbitrators have an obligation to disclose facts and circumstances that give rise to doubts as to their impartiality or independence, stating that *\"impartiality\"* is *\"absence of bias, prejudgment and conflict of interest\".20* The Claimants contend that the Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 responses and decisions after 20 September 2016 were not justified,21 and that their replies to ICSID were evasive, incomplete22 and biased.23 The Claimants add that the decisions rendered by the Tribunal since 13 October 2016 are not impartial.24\n\nProposal, para. 42; Observations, paras. 38-40, 89.\n\nObservations, paras. 41-47.\n\nObservations, paras. 41,48-51, 74-87.\n\nObservations, paras. 41, 52-66, 74-87.\n\nObservations, paras. 67-73.\n\n**d) Chilean Rules on Ethics**\n------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants refer to a statement from the Chilean Bar Association, that when several attorneys are members of the same professional team, disqualifying circumstances for one member constitute disqualifying circumstances for all members, regardless of the form that team takes. The declaration further indicates that such a conflict of interest does not require a formal business tie between individuals as long as they operate their business *\"under the same roof.\"25*\n\nProposal, paras. 54-55.\n\n**e) Other Sources**\n--------------------\n\n61.\n\nFinally, the Claimants cite an article by Professor William W. Park stating that conflicts of interest might occur in the absence of shared profits between barristers from the same chambers.26\n\nProposal para. 26.\n\n**2) The Circumstances of This Case**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Respondent\u2019s Previous Conduct**\n----------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the failure to disclose by the Challenged Arbitrators is particularly serious given that the initial award of 8 May 2008 found that the Respondent had committed a denial of justice by concealing the existence of a Chilean court decision which had a major effect on the course of the arbitration.27 The Claimants also allege that the Respondent has continuously sought to place the Tribunal under its direct or indirect control or to derail the proceeding, which prolonged the case and increased its costs.28\n\nProposal, para. 52.\n\nProposal, paras. 52-53 ; Observations, paras. 98-118.\n\n**b) Admissibility and Promptness**\n-----------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention applies to all proceedings provided for in Chapter IV (\"Arbitration\") of the Convention.29 They add that ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 does not distinguish between arbitrators acting in proceedings governed by Articles 50, 51 and 52 of the ICSID Convention from arbitrators acting in proceedings under Article 49 of the Convention.30\n\nObservations, paras. 1-2.\n\nObservations, para. 3.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the Proposal was submitted one day after the Tribunal formally rejected their requests for full disclosure, and therefore was submitted promptly under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).31 The Claimants state that they became aware of the Chile-Essex Court Chambers relationship on 20 September 2016, two days after the Respondent mentioned it in the Chilean press, and five days after the Award was rendered. Therefore, they learned about the relationship after the Tribunal became *functus officio.* The Claimants also assert that the Proposal was filed before closing the rectification proceeding, in compliance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.32\n\nProposal, paras. 74-84.\n\nObservations, paras. 5-6, 14-16, 88.\n\n**c) Waiver**\n-------------\n\n65.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the *\"Claimants have waived their right to object on the basis of Essex Court Barristers representing Chile before the ICJ\"* has no merit, for the following reasons. First, very little time elapsed between the time the Claimants became aware of the relationship between Chile and Essex Courts Chambers and the Claimants\u2019 first requests for further disclosures.33 Second, under English and French law, an arbitrator must disclose relevant facts even if those are in the public domain.34 Third, the Respondent had an obligation to disclose the relationship between Chile and Essex Courts Chambers.35\n\nObservations, para. 89.\n\nObservations, para. 89.\n\nObservations, paras. 89-96.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants therefore request that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID uphold the Proposal and that all costs and fees incurred by the Claimants in connection with it be borne by the Respondent.36\n\nObservations, para. 118.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s arguments opposing the Claimants\u2019 Proposal were set forth in its submission of 16 December 2016. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**1) Relevant Background**\n--------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent lists the background information that it contends is necessary to evaluate this Proposal.37 In particular, the Respondent describes the process to constitute the resubmission Tribunal.38 After the Claimants appointed Professor Philippe Sands QC to the Tribunal, the Respondent asked the Centre to inquire with Professor Sands concerning his role in an ICJ case between Chile and Bolivia. Professor Sands advised the Parties that he was not acting as legal counsel for Bolivia in that ICJ case, nor was he involved in any proceeding for or against Chile.39\n\nResponse, paras. 3-25.\n\nResponse, paras. 4-12.\n\nResponse, para. 4.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent also recalls that the Secretary-General of ICSID attached Sir Franklin Berman QC\u2019s *curriculum vitae* to the letter informing the Parties of ICSID\u2019s intention to propose his appointment as President of the Resubmission Tribunal, and that the *curriculum vitae* identified Sir Franklin Berman QC as a member of Essex Court Chambers.40\n\nResponse, para. 6.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Essex Court Chambers website explains that it \"*is* *not a firm, nor are its members partners or employees. Rather, Chambers is comprised of individual barristers, each of whom is a self-employed sole practitioner.\"* The Essex Court Chambers website further explains that members of chambers commonly appear on opposing sides in the same dispute, including in arbitration proceedings, or in front of other Essex Court Chambers members acting as arbitrators, with protocols in place to safeguard confidentiality.41\n\nResponse, para. 7.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that when Sir Franklin Berman QC was proposed by ICSID, other members of Essex Court Chambers were acting as counsel in ICJ proceedings involving Chile: Mr. Vaughan Lowe QC was representing Bolivia in a case against Chile and Mr. Samuel Wordsworth QC was representing Chile in another case against Peru. The Respondent submits that neither the ICSID Secretariat nor the Claimants raised any concerns when Sir Franklin Berman QC was proposed and then appointed,42 nor did the Claimants object when Sir Franklin Berman QC accepted his appointment.43 Rather, the Claimants expressly stated that Sir Franklin Berman QC satisfied the requirements of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention.44\n\nResponse, para. 9.\n\nResponse, para. 10.\n\nResponse, para. 9.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the Claimants appointed another barrister member of Essex Court Chambers, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC, to replace Professor Sands QC on the Resubmission Tribunal.45 The *curriculum vitae* of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC was provided to the Parties when he accepted his appointment. It identified Mr. V.V. Veeder QC as a member of Essex Court Chambers.46\n\nResponse, para. 11.\n\nResponse, para. 11.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent adds that between the first session of the Tribunal on 11 March 2014 and the hearing in London in April 2015, *\"various media outlets reported on the progress of the Bolivia v. Chile dispute, and mentioned that Samuel Wordsworth \u2014 the Essex Court Chambers barrister who had represented Chile in the Peru v. Chile dispute \u2014 had also joined the team representing Chile in Bolivia v. Chile\"* and that the *\"Claimants never expressed any concern about these developments.\"47*\n\nResponse, para. 12 (footnotes omitted), referring to several press articles: **Exhibit R-36,** *Wordsworth: \u2018La frontera maritima entre Chile y P\u00e9rit es un tema zanjado hace mucho,\u2019* LA NACION, 14 December 2012; **Exhibit R-39,** *Chile cambia estrategia ante La Haya,* LA TERCERA, 12 April 2014; **Exhibit R-40,** *Bolivia llevar\u00e2 \u2018El mar\u2019, un texto de la demanda maritima, al G77,* LA RAZON, 24 May 2014; **Exhibit R-41,** *La Haya: Defensa de Chile se re\u00fbne con abogados internacionales por demanda de Bolivia,* LA TERCERA, 8 December 2014; **Exhibit R-42,** *La Haya: Estos jv.eron los argumentos de Chile en el primer dia de alegatos ante Bolivia.* LA NACION, 4 May 2015; **Exhibit R-43.** *Los equipos que representan a Chile y Bolivia en la Haya,* EMOL, 4 May 2015; **Exhibit R-44,** *Chile to World Court: No Negotiation on Sea Access jor Bolivia,* PAN AM POST, 11 May 2015; **Exhibit R-47,** *Chile defender\u00e2 ante La Haya validez y car\u00e2cter de tratado limitrofe con Peru,* LA TERCERA, 6 December 2012\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants complained and began asking for disclosures of information about the relationship between Chile and members of Essex Court Chambers only after the Award was issued to the Parties, on 13 September 2016, and after Chile\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister announced on 18 September 2016 that Professor Alan Boyle of Essex Court Chambers was also representing Chile in the most recent ICJ case against Bolivia.48\n\nResponse, para. 14.\n\n**2) The Claimants\u2019 Proposal is Inadmissible**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there has never been an arbitrator challenge in an ICSID rectification proceeding and that Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 49 do not provide for this possibility. It argues that rectification proceedings are incompatible with arbitrator challenges and allowing a challenge would undermine the very nature of the rectification remedy.49 In support, the Respondent cites the Commentary to the 1968 version of the ICSID Arbitration Rules which explains that \"[u]*nlike an interpretation, revision or annulment of an award... [,] the rectification of an award can **only** be made by the Tribunal that rendered the award.\"50* The Respondent also cites Professeur Schreuer, who submits that if *\"for **whatever** reason, the original tribunal is no longer available, **the remedy of Art. 49(2) [i.e., supplementation and rectification] cannot be used.\"51***\n\nResponse, paras. 26, 27, 30.\n\nResponse, para. 27, citing ICSID Arbitration Rules (1968), Note D to Arbitration Rule 49 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nResponse, para. 27, citing C. Schreuer et al., THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY, Art. 49, \u00b6 36 (2d. ed. 2009) (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent submits that rectification is a *sui generis* remedy, independent from the other provisions of the ICSID Convention and that ICSID Arbitration Rule 49 expressly provides that only ICSID Arbitration Rules 46 to 48 apply in a rectification proceeding.52 It notes that the Claimants base their Proposal on Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and on ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 but never explain why these provisions should apply.53\n\nResponse, paras. 28, 29.\n\nResponse, para. 28.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent therefore concludes that the Proposal is inadmissible because the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules preclude arbitrator challenges in a rectification proceeding.54\n\nResponse, para. 30.\n\n**3) The Claimants\u2019 Proposal is Unfounded**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the party seeking disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention must identify a fact that would cause a reasonable person to infer that the challenged arbitrator manifestly cannot be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgement. A simple belief or assertion of conflict of interest is insufficient.55\n\nResponse, para. 32.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the only facts relied on by the Claimants are that the Challenged Arbitrators: (i) were acting as arbitrators in the resubmission proceeding while other members of Essex Court Chambers were counsel in ICJ cases involving Chile; (ii) did not disclose this in their ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) declarations; and (iii) did not respond satisfactorily to the Claimants\u2019 demands for information.56\n\nResponse, para. 33.\n\n80.\n\nFor the Respondent, these facts cannot justify disqualification for the following reasons: (i) barristers\u2019 chambers are not treated as equivalent to law firms for conflict purposes;57 (ii) both Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V. V. Veeder QC complied with their obligation to disclose pertinent information to the Parties and were justified in not acceding to an unreasonable demand for information that they did not and could not have had;58 (iii) it was public knowledge throughout the entire resubmission proceeding that barristers from Essex Court Chambers were representing the Respondent before the ICJ, and the Claimants waived their right to rely on such a publicly known fact by not submitting their challenge promptly;59 and (iv) the Claimants\u2019 disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s adverse ruling not to suspend the rectification proceeding is not a viable basis for disqualification.60\n\nResponse, paras. 34-36..\n\nResponse, para. 37.\n\nResponse, para. 38-39, referring to *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on Proposal tor Disqualification (13 December 2013) (\"***Burlington\"),*** para. 67.\n\nResponse, para. 40.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimants\u2019 Proposal is inadmissible, unfounded and frivolous, and requests that the challenge be summarily rejected with the Claimants paying the Respondent\u2019s costs and fees incurred in connection with this Proposal.61\n\nResponse, para. 42.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n82.\n\nThree main issues were addressed by the Parties in relation to the disqualification Proposal:\n\ni. was the Proposal made promptly as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1);\n\nii. can a proposal for disqualification be made in a rectification proceeding pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 49; and\n\niii. if the answers to (i) and (ii) above are affirmative, do the facts described in the Proposal establish that the Challenged Arbitrators manifestly lack reliability to exercise independent judgment, justifying a disqualification under Articles 57 and 14 of the ICSID Convention?\n\n83.\n\nWith respect to timeliness, ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n84.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify the period of time within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case by case basis.62\n\n*Burlington,* para. 73; *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B. V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15), Decision on proposal for Disqualification of an Arbitrator (November 6, 2009), para. 41\n\n86.\n\nIn this instance, the Claimants argue that the representation of Chile by Essex Court Chambers barristers was made public for the first time a few days after the Award was issued on 13 September 2016, through a statement made by a Government official in a Chilean newspaper article.68 This is disputed by the Respondent, which claims that the representation of Chile in ICJ proceedings by Essex Court Chambers barristers was public knowledge throughout the resubmission proceedings.\n\nExhibits 6 and 7 to the Proposal.\n\n87.\n\nIt is undisputed that both parties knew that Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC were members of Essex Court Chambers since their respective appointments.\n\n88.\n\nThe evidence in the record of the case shows that information concerning Chile\u2019s representation by Essex Court Chambers barristers in ICJ proceedings had been publicly available since December 2012. In particular, it was reported in the press that Mr. Samuel Wordsworth QC, one of the Essex Court Chambers barristers identified by the Claimants, was acting for Chile in certain ICJ proceedings.69\n\nBy way of example, the Respondent appended several media articles published between December 2012 and May 2015 that expressly referred to the participation of Essex Court Chambers barristers as counsel for Chile in ICJ cases: **Exhibit R-47,** article published by LA TERCERA on *b* December 2012 regarding Mr. Wordsworth\u2019s role in the Peru-Chile maritime border case at the ICJ; **Exhibit R-36,** article published by LA NACI\u00d3N on 14 December 2012 regarding Mr. Wordsworth\u2019s first intervention at the hearing in the Peru-Chile maritime border case at the ICJ; **Exhibit, R-39,** article published by LA TERCERA on 12 April 2014 regarding a change of Chile\u2019s strategy in the in the Peru-Chile maritime border case at the ICJ and mentioning Mr. Wordsworth as one of Chile\u2019s counsel; **Exhibit R-40,** article published by LA RAZ\u00d3N on 24 May 2014 regarding the Bolivia-Chile Pacific Ocean access case at the ICJ and mentioning Mr. Wordsworth as one of Chile\u2019s counsel; **Exhibit R-41,** article published by LA TERCERA on 8 December 2014 regarding a meeting of Chile\u2019s legal team in the Bolivia-Chile Pacific Ocean access case and mentioning Mr. Wordsworth as one of Chile\u2019s counsel; **Exhibit R-42,** article published by LA NACI\u00d3N on 4 May 2015 Bolivia\u2019s preliminary objections in the Bolivia-Chile Pacific Ocean access case and mentioning Mr. Wordsworth as one of Chile\u2019s counsel; **Exhibit R-43,** article published by EMOL on 4 May 2015 presenting the legal teams of both parties in the Bolivia-Chile Pacific Ocean access case and mentioning Mr. Wordsworth as one of Chile\u2019s counsel; and **Exhibit R-44,** article published by PAN AM POST on 11 May 2016 regarding the hearing in in the Bolivia-Chile Pacific Ocean access case and mentioning Mr. Wordsworth as one of Chile\u2019s counsel.\n\n89.\n\nThe 18 September 2016 article relied on by the Claimants as evidence of a hitherto secret relationship between Essex Court Chambers and Chile does not support this assertion. The article simply notes Chile\u2019s representation by another Essex Court Chamber barrister, Professor Alan Boyle, in another ICJ case separate from that involving Mr. Wordsworth QC.70\n\nExhibits 6 and 7 to the Proposal. The relevant parts of the article read:  \n***Stephen McCaffrey, Laurence Boisson de Chazournes and Alan Boyle, Chile\u2019s legal counsel for the Silala***  \n*Chile is currently working on the preparation of its memorial for the claim it has filed against Bolivia for the Silala River, which has to be filed at the Court on July 3rd of next year.*  \n*[...]*  \n*The Minister does not hide his enthusiasm when he speaks about the Silala\u2019s claim, and the strategy Jollowed in this regard, which included an \"advanced\" and secretive search for international counsel, who have been working for months - until now, in absolute secrecy - with the team lead by the agent Ximena Fuentes and the co-agents Juan Ignacio Pina and Mario Teresa Infante.*  \n*[...]*  \n*Today, for the first time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs revealed the names of three of these counsel, whom he does not hesitate to qualify as \"eminent figures\".

Like Samuel Wordsworth - Chile\u2019s counsel in the maritime case-he is a member of the prestigious chambers Essex Courts Chambers,* (translated from Spanish).\n\n90.\n\nThe record further shows that, throughout the arbitration and resubmission proceedings, the Claimants have referred to and cited numerous others press articles.71\n\n**Exhibit C-172,** *Declaration del Ministro de Bienes Nationales,* LA SEGUNDA, 14 May 2002, submitted with the Claimants\u2019 supplementary submission on the merits dated 11 September 2002; **Exhibit C-205,** *Declaration del Ministro de Bienes Nationales,* LA SEGUNDA, 22 August 2002, submitted with the Claimants\u2019 supplementary submission on the merits dated 11 September 2002; resubmitted as Exhibit C-M39 with the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on resubmission, dated 27 June 2014; **Exhibit C-207,** *Intervention del CDE en caso \"Clarin\" es intransable,* LA SEGUNDA, 21 August 2002; submitted with the Claimants\u2019 supplementary submission on the merits dated 11 September 2002: resubmitted as Exhibit C-M40 with the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on resubmission, dated 27 June 2014; **Exhibit C-209,** *Testa reconoce asesor\u00eda al Gobierno antes de defender a los indemnizados,* EL MERCURIO, 29 August 2002; submitted with the Claimants\u2019 supplementary submission on the merits dated 11 September 2002; resubmitted as Exhibit C-M32 with the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on resubmission, dated 27 June 2014; **Exhibit DP041,** *Loan Wolf,* FINANCIAL TIMES, 23 September 2005, submitted with the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Annulment dated 28 February 2011; **Footnote 254,** Weiniger and Page, *An ad hoc Committee has granted annulment on unusual grounds.

The Claimants have used the same or similar sources as those in which information about Essex Court Chambers barristers representing Chile before the ICJ was published.72\n\nThe Chairman of the Administrative Council notes that this information also was and still is widely reported in a number of other online sources, easily accessible to the public. For instance, another Chilean press article published on 5 May 2015 referred to *\"Samuel Wordsworth, another London lawyer, from Essex Street [sic] Chambers\"* as counsel for Chile in the Chile-Bolivia case before the ICJ *(See \u2018Chile mostr\u00f4 sus cartas en La Haya; llega el turno de Bolivia;* LA RAZON, 5 May 2015 (translated from Spanish: *\"Samuel Wordsworth, otro abogado londinense, de Essex Street [sic] Chambers\"),* available at htfp://la-razon.com/ind ex. php? url=/nacional/demanda mar%C3%ADtima/Chile-mostro-caitas-tumo-Bolivia 0 2265373488.html. An article published by Global Arbitration Review on 29 January 2014 reporting on the ICJ decision in the Chile-Peru case, and freely available through a Google search, also mentions: *\"Chile\u2019s advocates included [...] Samuel Wordsworth QC of Essex Court Chambers (See ICJ draws Peru-Chile maritime boundary.* GLOBAL ARBITRATION REVIEW, 29 January 2014. Available at http://www.bmaj.cl/p df/900 i cj-dra ws-p eru -ch.pdf) Mr. Wordsworth QC\u2019s biography on the Essex Court Chambers\u2019 website also mentions expressly *\"Notable cases as counsel include: before the ICJ, the Bolivia v Chile case concerning the obligation to negotiate access to the Pacific Ocean (for Chile), [..] the Peru v Chile [...] maritime boundary case (for Chile [...])\"* The involvement of Essex Court Chambers barristers as counsel for Chile in ICJ proceedings is also mentioned on the ICJ website: http:/ /www. icj-cij.org/ docket/index. php?p 1 =3&p2=3.\n\n92.\n\nIt is standard practice for a party to perform a conflict search of arbitrators at the time they are appointed, and, in particular, regarding its own candidate for appointment. The Claimants appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder QC in January 2014, long after several public sources had mentioned Mr. Wordsworth\u2019s representation of Chile. If the Claimants were concerned about Potential conflicts of interests arising out of the client relationships of other barristers at Essex Court Chambers, they could have raised this point at the time the Challenged Arbitrators were appointed. This would have been prudent in particular since, as is widely known, barristers\u2019 chambers take the view that barristers operate in strict independence of one another and chambers are not treated as equivalent to law firms for conflict purposes. There is no indication in the record that the Claimants had any concern of this kind.\n\n93.\n\nWhen the Claimants appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and agreed to the appointment of Sir Franklin. Berman QC, they knew that the Challenged Arbitrators were both members of Essex Court Chambers. At the same time, media regularly reported on Mr. Wordsworth\u2019s representing Chile in an unrelated case, and Claimants regularly relied on evidence from these same media outlets during the proceedings. In the specific circumstances of the present case, it appears that sufficient information was publicly available to the Claimants during the resubmission proceeding and they therefore knew or should have known that other barristers from Essex Court Chambers were acting for the Republic of Chile in the ICJ proceedings.\n\n94.\n\nFor the challenge to have been filed *promptly* in this case, it should have been filed early in the resubmission proceeding, and in any event before the closure of those proceedings. The resubmission tribunal, as reconstituted, commenced proceedings in January 2014, closed the proceedings in March 2016 and rendered the Award dismissing the Claimants\u2019 case on 13 September 2016. The Claimants made an inquiry into the representation of Chile by Essex Court Chambers barristers for the first time on 20 September 2016 and their Proposal was submitted on 22 November 2016. The Chairman of the Administrative Council finds that the Proposal cannot be considered as having been filed *\"promptly\"* for the purposes of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1), and must be dismissed. '\n\n**IV.

Veeder and Sir Franklin Berman QC", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2017-04-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder and Sir Franklin Berman QC\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Centre transmitted the Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council on the Claimants' 22 November 2016 Proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC to the Parties.\n\n2.\n\nParagraphs 1 to 39 of the 21 February 2017 Decision recite the relevant procedural history to that date and may be referred to as background for this Decision.\n\n3.\n\nOn 23 February 2017, the Claimants proposed the disqualification of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the \"**Veeder Proposal**\").\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 23 February 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that the rectification proceeding was suspended until the Veeder Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), and that the proposal would be decided by the other members of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 24 February 2017, the Claimants submitted that Sir Franklin Berman QC could not decide the Veeder Proposal because of a conflict of interest between him and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC. The Claimants asked the Centre to invite Sir Franklin Berman QC to provide his position on the matter prior to establishing a calendar for the submissions on the Veeder Proposal. The Claimants also informed the Centre that they would submit additional grounds to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC from the deciding the Veeder Proposal.\n\n6.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, the Claimants proposed that Sir Franklin Berman QC be disqualified from deciding the Veeder Proposal, and that the matter be referred to and decided by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The Claimants also requested that the Veeder Proposal be referred to and decided by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 1 March 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that: (a) Sir Franklin Berman QC had declined to consider and decide the Veeder Proposal; (b) the proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC from deciding the Veeder Proposal was therefore moot; (c) there were no circumstances justifying referral of the Veeder Proposal to the Permanent Court of Arbitration; and (d) the Veeder Proposal would be decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID. A schedule of submissions and the letter dated 1 March 2017 from Sir Franklin Berman QC to the Secretary-General of ICSID were transmitted to the Parties. The 1 March 2017 letter read:\n\n*Dear Secretary-General,*\n\n*I have seen the circular notification from the Secretary to the Tribunal of a renewed challenge by the Claimant Parties to the appointment of my coarbitrator, Mr VV Veeder, in the wake of the rejection by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the earlier challenge to both Mr Veeder and me. The Secretary's letter indicates that, under the terms of Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, the decision on this new challenge falls to be decided by Me. Mourre and myself, as the two remaining members of the Tribunal.*\n\n*Notwithstanding the above, it does not seem to me right that I should sit on this challenge.*\n\n*If I were to do so, any ruling I proceeded to make on the challenge would lay itself open to an accusation that I lacked the necessary objectivity and impartiality, either because I had just myself been under challenge by the same Parties, or because both the old and the new challenges implicate directly the relationship between members of the same Barristers' Chambers, as is the case with Mr Veeder and myself.*\n\n*Furthermore, and perhaps more important still, the new challenge, based as it is on the same ground as the old challenge, is not dissimilar to an appeal against the rejection of the latter.*\n\n*For all of the above reasons, it would be more conducive to the health of the arbitration system under the Convention and the Rules if the new challenge, like the old, were to be heard and decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. That would not, in my view, be in any sense incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and the Rules, taken in their entirety.*\n\n*Since writing the above, I have seen a copy of the further letter from counsel for the Claimant Parties, dated 24 February 2017. While I do not accept the argument as to an 'objective conflict of interests,' the letter serves nevertheless to reinforce my view that the only acceptable solution is for the new challenge to Mr Veeder to be decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.*\n\n*Please feel at liberty to circulate the terms of this letter as you think fit.*\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 March 2017, the Claimants proposed the disqualification from the rectification Tribunal of Sir Franklin Berman QC in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the \"**Berman Proposal**\"). The Claimants also requested that the Berman Proposal be referred to and decided by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 6 March 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that it was treating the Claimants' Veeder Proposal and Berman Proposal as a proposal to disqualify a majority of the Tribunal, to be decided simultaneously by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. The Centre also sent the Parties Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations, dated 6 March 2017 and a revised schedule of submissions which superseded the schedule transmitted on 1 March 2017.1 Finally, the Centre informed the Parties that there were no circumstances justifying referral of the Berman Proposal to the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nMr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations dated 6 March 2017 are annexed to this Decision.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 7 March 2017, the Claimants asked the Centre to suspend the schedule of submissions set in its letter dated 6 March 2017 until the Centre arranged for the Claimants to consult certain documents from the Centre's archives relating to the resignation of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC in the *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Venezuela* case (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6) (the \"***Vannessa Ventures*** **documents**\").\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 10 March 2017, the Centre again informed the Parties that case documents other than those published on the ICSID website are not public and cannot be disclosed by the Centre without consent of the parties to that case. The Centre confirmed that the schedule set out in its letter dated 6 March 2017 remained in place.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 11 March 2017, the Claimants asked the Centre to rule on a possible breach of Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants submitted that the breach was caused by Sir Franklin Berman having declined to decide the Veeder Proposal and by the Centre subsequently considering the Claimants' proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC from deciding the Veeder Proposal as moot.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 13 March 2017, the Claimants asked to consult the *Vannessa Ventures* documents in the presence of the Respondent, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n14.\n\nBy email dated 13 March 2017, the Claimants submitted the Spanish versions of their proposals to disqualify the majority of the Tribunal. The Centre transmitted these to the Respondent.\n\n15.\n\nBy email dated 14 March 2017, the Centre informed the Claimants that the Spanish version of the Veeder Proposal was missing from their email dated 13 March 2017. The Claimants provided the missing document on the same day.\n\n16.\n\nBy email dated 14 March 2017, the Respondent requested that the 7-day period for submission of its Response start running from 14 March 2017, the date on which the Spanish translation of the Veeder Proposal was actually received.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 14 March 2017, the Centre invited the Respondent to submit its Response by Wednesday 22 March 2017, and invited the Parties to submit their observations on Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations by the same date. The Centre also informed the Parties that Sir Franklin Berman QC had indicated that he did not wish to provide any comment or explanation regarding the Berman Proposal. Finally, the Centre reiterated that case documents other than those published on the ICSID website are not public and can only be disclosed to third parties by the Centre with the consent of the parties to that case. The Centre noted that such consent had not been communicated to it and therefore the Centre could not produce the *Vannessa Ventures* documents for inspection by the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 15 March 2017, the Claimants noted that the revised date for the submission of its Response by the Respondent was set more than 7 days after the Spanish translation of the Veeder Proposal was filed. The Claimants also requested that they be granted time to review the Respondent's Response before filing their observations on Mr. V. V. Veeder QC's explanations. Finally the Claimants inquired about the authority of the Chairman of the Administrative Council to review *Vannessa Ventures* documents *in camera.*\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 15 March 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that the Respondent's Response and the Parties' observations on Mr. V. V. Veeder QC's explanations were to be filed on Tuesday 21 March 2017, not on Wednesday 22 March 2017 as erroneously indicated in the Centre's letter dated 14 March 2017. The Centre also informed the Parties that they would have a further opportunity to submit final observations on a date to be determined based on whether Mr. V.V. Veeder QC filed further explanations. Finally, the Centre advised the Parties that the Chairman of the Administrative Council would consider and decide the proposals to disqualify the majority of the Tribunal on the basis of the submissions and evidence on the record of this case.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 March 2017, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimants' proposals, and the Claimants submitted their observations on Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations.\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 March 2017, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC indicated that he did not wish to submit further explanations. The Centre invited the Parties to submit their final observations by 24 March 2017.\n\n22.\n\nOn 24 March 2017, the Claimants submitted their final observations and the Respondent informed the Centre that it had no further observations.\n\n**II. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**1) The Proposal to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants' position was set forth in their Veeder Proposal of 23 February 2017, their Further Observations of 21 March 2017 and their Final Observations of 24 March 2017. It is summarized below.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants' proposal stems from Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's 11 December 2016 explanations regarding his resignation as President of the tribunal in the *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela* case, submitted in the context of the Claimants' first challenge to the majority of the Tribunal (the \"**First Proposal**\").2 The Claimants make two points.\n\nClaimants' Veeder Proposal, paras. 1-2.\n\n25.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied when he stated that he \"***learnt at the jurisdictional hearing, for the first time**\"* that Sir Christopher Greenwood QC, a member of Essex Court Chambers, was acting as counsel for the Claimant in the *Vannessa Ventures* case. The Claimants submit that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC did not learn of this fact at the jurisdictional hearing, but rather twelve days before the jurisdictional hearing.3\n\nClaimants' Veeder Proposal, paras. 23-26; Claimants' Further Observations, paras. 47-58.\n\n26.\n\nSecond, the Claimants take issue with Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanation that he \"*did not resign because [Professor Greenwood] and [Professor Veeder] were both members of the same barristers' chambers\"* but because Professor Greenwood was \"*also co-counsel with [Mr. Veeder] acting for a different party in a different and unrelated ICSID Case.*\" The Claimants argue that this explanation is incomplete and misleading because it fails to mention that Mr. Veeder QC resigned in the *Vannessa Ventures* case after counsel for Venezuela raised an objection based on the fact that Professor Greenwood and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC practiced in the same chambers.4\n\nClaimants' Veeder Proposal, paras. 27-33\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's misleading omissions in the 11 December 2016 explanations, which were repeated in his explanations dated 6 March 2017, are proved by the correspondence exchanged in the *Vannessa Ventures* case before the jurisdictional hearing, and by the transcript of the *Vannessa Ventures* hearing.5\n\nClaimants' Veeder Proposal, paras. 34, 38; Claimants' Further Observations, paras. 1-30.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations submitted on the First Proposal and repeated in the Veeder Proposal demonstrate the Respondent's influence over members of Essex Court Chambers. They also argue that they establish a manifest lack of impartiality under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention.6\n\nClaimants' Further Observations, paras. 31-58.\n\n**2) The Proposal to Disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants' position was set forth in their Berman Proposal of 4 March 2017, their Further Observations of 21 March 2017 and their Final Observations of 24 March 2017. It is summarized below.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants' proposal stems from the reasons for declining to decide the Veeder Proposal given by Sir Franklin Berman QC in his letter dated 1 March 2017.7\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 1-2.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Sir Franklin Berman QC acknowledged that he could only have rejected the Veeder Proposal if he had ruled on it, thereby prejudging the issues raised therein.8\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 3, 6, 10, 47; Claimants' Further Observations, para. 63.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that Sir Franklin Berman QC ignored the distinct allegations in the Veeder Proposal by considering that the First Proposal and the Veeder Proposal were identical and that the latter was a disguised appeal of the former.9\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 4, 9; Claimants' Further Observations, para. 63.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants add that by ignoring their request to the Centre, Sir Franklin Berman QC had prevented them from accessing the *Vannessa Ventures* documents, thereby furthering the imbalance between the Parties with respect to access to crucial information.10\n\nCounsel for the Respondent were counsel for Venezuela in *Vannessa Venture* s. Claimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 9-10.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Sir Franklin Berman QC inappropriately recommended that the Veeder Proposal be decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID.11\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 5, 9; Claimants' Further Observations, para. 65.\n\n35.\n\nThey argue that his 1 March 2017 letter disregards the ICSID Convention, English law and the IBA Rules on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration12 and is evidence of a manifest and objective bias and absence of impartiality to the detriment of the Claimants.13\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 35-53.\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 2, 7-10, 53, 70, 77.\n\n36.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants consider that Sir Franklin Berman QC's refusal to decide the Veeder Proposal breached the ICSID Convention.14\n\nClaimants' Further Observations, paras. 65-69.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent recites the recent procedural history of this case arguing that the Claimants have abused the ICSID system.15 It asks ICSID to consider all mechanisms available to end the Claimants' abuse.16\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 1-15.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 16-18.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Chairman of the Administrative Council to dismiss the Claimants' proposals to disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC.17 It also requests an order that the Claimants pay any further advances on costs, and that the Respondent be awarded its costs, expenses and interest.18 The Respondent adds that the Tribunal should grant such relief if the Chairman of the Administrative Council lacks authority to do so.19\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 19(a).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 19(b) and (c).\n\nRespondent's Response, footnote 42.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n**A. The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\n\n40.\n\nThe disqualifications proposed in this case allege that two members of the Tribunal manifestly lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address disqualification \"*on the ground that [an arbitrator] was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\"\n\n41.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"20 and that it relates to the ease with which thealleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.21\n\nSee *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA. v.

Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, Second Edition (2009), page 1202 \u00b6\u00b6134-154.\n\n42.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n43.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d'ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions,*\" the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.22\n\n*Suez,* \u00b6 28 *; OPIC Karimum Corporation v.

Independence is characterized by the absence of external control.23 Independence and impartiality both \"*protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case*.\"24 Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.25\n\n*Suez*, \u00b6 29; *ConocoPhillips*, \u00b6 54; *Burlington,* \u00b6 66; *Abaclat,* \u00b6 75; *Conoco,* \u00b6 51; *Conoco et al.*, \u00b6 81.\n\n*ConocoPhillips*, \u00b6 55; *Universal*, \u00b6 70; *Urbaser S.A. and others v.

Timeliness**\n-----------------\n\n46.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n47.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case by case basis.28 Previous tribunals have found that a proposal was timely when filed within 10 days of learning the underlying facts,29 but untimely when filed after 53 days.30\n\n*Burlington*, \u00b6 73; *Conoco*, \u00b6 39; *Abaclat*, \u00b6 68; *Conoco et al.*, \u00b6 63.\n\n*Urbaser,* \u00b6 19.\n\n*Suez*, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent has not made any submission regarding the timeliness of the Claimants' Proposals.\n\n49.\n\nThe Veeder Proposal was filed 74 days after Mr. V.V. Veeder QC submitted his explanations on 11 December 2016, and 2 days after the resumption of the rectification proceeding following the 21 February 2017 Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council on the First Proposal. As the Veeder Proposal could not have been submitted earlier while the proceeding was suspended, the Veeder Proposal was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n50.\n\nThe Berman Proposal was filed 3 days after Sir Franklin Berman QC sent his 1 March 2017 letter and was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**C. Merits**\n-------------\n\n**1) The Proposal to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants' proposal to disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC rests, in substance, on two grounds: a) Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied concerning when he learned that Sir Christopher Greenwood QC's was appearing as counsel for the claimants in the *Vannessa Ventures* case (\"**First Ground**\"); and b) Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied when he explained his resignation was not due to the fact that Sir Christopher Greenwood was practicing at Essex Court Chambers (\"**Second Ground**\").\n\n52.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the Claimants' First Proposal had submitted that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC should have resigned from the Rectification Tribunal in the present case on the same basis as his resignation from the *Vannessa Ventures* tribunal. Mr. V.V. Veeder QC had explained that the circumstances of his resignation in *Vannessa Ventures* were different and of no relevance to this case.\n\n53.\n\nHaving reviewed the submissions and documents filed by the Parties and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC, the Chairman of the Administrative Council does not find any evidence that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied as alleged by the Claimants.\n\na) First Ground\n---------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 11 December 2016, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC wrote that he \"*learnt at the jurisdictional hearing, for the first time, that one of the counsel acting for the claimant (Vanessa Ventures) was an English barrister who was, at that time, also co-counsel with me acting for a different party in a different and unrelated ICSID Case*.\"\n\n55.\n\nIt is clear that the phrase \"*at the jurisdictional hearing*\" was used to signify \"*at the time of the jurisdictional hearing*\" and not to indicate the precise moment when Mr. V.V. Veeder QC became aware of Sir Christopher Greenwood QC's involvement as counsel.\n\n56.\n\nIn his explanations dated 6 March 2017, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC confirmed that he learned about Sir Christopher Greenwood's involvement as counsel in the *Vannessa Ventures* case during the hearing preparation period, a few days before the hearing started.\n\n57.\n\nThe Chairman of the Administrative Council cannot consider that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's generic reference to \"*at the jurisdictional hearing*\" instead of \"*days before the jurisdictional hearing*\" constitutes a lie or a misleading formulation.\n\nb) Second Ground\n----------------\n\n58.\n\nOn 11 December 2016, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC explained that he resigned from the *Vannessa Ventures* tribunal because Sir Christopher Greenwood QC was his co-counsel and coarbitrator in two unrelated ICSID cases, not because he was a member of Essex Court Chambers.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC failed to mention that the respondent in the *Vannessa Ventures* case had also objected based on Messrs. Veeder and Greenwood's practicing in the same chambers. The Claimants submit that this omission was deliberate and designed to mislead as to the true reasons for Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's resignation.\n\n60.\n\nIn his 6 March 2017 explanations, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC has re-confirmed that he did not resign from the *Vanessa Ventures* case because he practiced in the same chambers as Sir Christopher Greenwood.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the documents from the *Vannessa Ventures* case contradict Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations and show that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC resigned after Venezuela raised its objection based on the Essex Court Chambers relationship.\n\n62.\n\nThe Chairman of the Administrative Council has reviewed the documents submitted by the Claimants with their Further Observations dated 21 March 2016, in particular the letter from counsel for Venezuela dated 3 May 2007 and the transcript of the hearing.\n\n63.\n\nIn their letter dated 3 May 3007, counsel for Venezuela noted that Sir Christopher Greenwood QC \"*is a door-tenant of the same Chambers from which Mr. Veeder practices, is a coarbitrator with Mr. Veeder in a separate ICSID proceeding, and is co-counsel with Mr. Veeder in another ICSID proceeding*.\"\n\n64.\n\nThe transcript of the hearing during which Mr. V.V. Veeder QC resigned reads, in relevant part:\n\n*PRESIDENT VEEDER: I am greatly troubled by the circumstances in which Professor Greenwood was instructed as counsel by the Claimant last autumn, and that this development was not disclosed to the Tribunal, ICSID or the Respondent until recently.*\n\n*I do not consider that I can continue in this arbitration as Chairman of this Tribunal unless both parties expressly consent to my doing so now, and Professor Greenwood withdraws from this case with immediate effect.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*I thank the parties for their exchanges. Having carefully considered those exchanges, I cannot, in these circumstances, continue as President of this Tribunal, and accordingly I shall forthwith submit my resignation as a member of this Tribunal in accordance with Article 14, subparagraph (3) of the arbitration additional facility rules.*\n\n65.\n\nNothing in these documents supports the Claimants' assertion that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's resignation was because Sir Christopher Greenwood QC was a barrister in the same chambers as Mr. V.V. Veeder QC.\n\n66.\n\nThe fact that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC resigned after Venezuela raised the Essex Court Chambers objection does not establish that this objection was the cause of the resignation, as the Claimants contend.\n\n67.\n\nTo the contrary, Mr. V.V. Veeder QC has explained twice that his resignation was prompted by the other grounds raised by counsel for Venezuela in their letter dated 3 May 3007. In the Chairman of the Administrative Council's view, the Claimants' characterization of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations as incomplete, misleading and untruthful is unsupported. A third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's explanations, the surrounding facts and the evidence relied upon in the Claimants' Veeder Proposal would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.\n\n**2) The Proposal to Disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Chairman of the Administrative Council is not convinced by the arguments advanced by the Claimants in support of the Berman Proposal.\n\n69.\n\n*First*, Sir Franklin Berman QC did not state that he could only have rejected the Veeder Proposal if he had ruled on it. Rather, he expressed his concern that any decision he would reach would be used against him. The Claimants' filing of the Berman Proposal following his decision not to decide the Veeder Proposal appears to validate such concern.\n\n70.\n\n*Second*, Sir Franklin Berman QC did not state that the First Proposal and the Veeder Proposal were \"completely identical.\"31 Rather, he noted that the two proposals were \"*not dissimilar*\" because of the grounds on which they rest. The Chairman notes in that respect that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC's alleged omissions regarding his resignation in the *Vannessa Ventures* case had in fact been raised by the Claimants in their further observations on the First Proposal submitted on 13 January 2017.32\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, para. 4.\n\nClaimants' Further Observations to the First Proposal dated 13 January 2017, paras. 82-84.\n\n71.\n\n*Third*, it is clear that Sir Franklin Berman QC did not prevent the Claimants from accessing the *Vannessa Ventures* documents as contended by the Claimants. Not only did he not have authority to authorize the disclosure of these documents, but the Claimants had requested these documents from the Centre, not from Sir Franklin Berman.\n\n72.\n\n*Fourth*, Sir Franklin Berman QC did not \"recommend\" that the Veeder Proposal be decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council so as to further a conspiracy against the Claimants. He merely indicated that the Veeder Proposal, if not decided by the unchallenged arbitrators, could be decided by the same authority that decided the First Proposal and that he did not view this as incompatible with the ICSID Convention and Rules.\n\n73.\n\n*Fifth,* the Chairman of the Administrative Council notes the clear contradiction in the Claimants' position regarding Sir Franklin Berman QC's recusal from the decision of the Veeder Proposal. The Claimants sought such recusal twice (in their letter dated 24 February 2017 and in their 28 February 2017 Proposal to Disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC) and approved such recusal in their Berman Proposal dated 4 March 2017, acknowledging that they had themselves requested it and that it became moot.33\n\nClaimants' Berman Proposal, paras. 1 and 68, footnote 9.\n\n74.\n\nAt the same time, the Claimants contend in their 21 March 2017 observations that Sir Franklin Berman QC's recusal breached the ICSID Convention, and if accepted, the proposed recusal would have caused a vacancy on the Rectification Tribunal.\n\n75.\n\nThis is both incorrect and irrelevant. The Proposal to Disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC from deciding the Veeder Proposal dated 28 February 2017 only concerned whether or not Sir Franklin Berman QC could decide the Veeder Proposal; it became moot, as acknowledged by the Claimants, when Sir Franklin Berman QC declined to decide the Veeder Proposal. If Sir Franklin Berman QC had not declined to decide the Veeder Proposal, and if the 28 February 2017 disqualification proposal had been accepted, no vacancy would have been created on the Rectification Tribunal, because the Claimants only requested that Sir Franklin Berman QC be removed from the decision on the Veeder Proposal.\n\n76.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Chairman of the Administrative Council cannot find any evidence of Sir Franklin Berman QC's lack of impartiality to decide the Claimants' requests for rectification.\n\n77.\n\nIn the Chairman of the Administrative Council's view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of Sir Franklin Berman QC's letter dated 1 March 2017 would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n78.\n\nHaving considered all the facts alleged as well as the arguments and evidence submitted by the Parties, and for the reasons stated above, the Chairman of the Administrative Council dismisses the Claimants' Proposals to disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent's requests in paragraphs 19 (b) and (c) of its Response that the Claimants pay any further advances on costs, and that the Respondent be awarded its costs, expenses and interest will have to be submitted to, and decided by, the Tribunal."}, {"Title": "Decision on Rectification of the Award", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2017-10-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Rectification of the Award\n--------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 May 2008, an arbitral Tribunal composed of Professor Pierre Lalive, Mr. Mohammed Chemloul and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard (\"the First Tribunal\") rendered an award in *Victor Pey Casado and Foundation \"Presidente Allende\" v. The Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/198/2) (\"the First Award\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, an *ad hoc* committee composed of Professor Piero Bernardini, Mr. L. Yves Fortier QC and Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri partially annulled the First Award, subsequent to which the Claimants resubmitted the dispute to a new tribunal (\"the Resubmission Proceedings\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 13 September 2016, the present Tribunal, as Arbitral Tribunal in the Resubmission Proceedings, (\"the Tribunal\") rendered an Award (\"the Resubmission Award\").\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 27 October 2016, the Claimants submitted a Request for Rectification of the Resubmission Award pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention (\"the Request for Rectification\"). In that same letter, the Claimants made certain requests for inquiry and disclosure by Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder, and further requested that the rectification proceeding be suspended until the tribunal called upon to interpret the First Award of 8 May 2008 had issued its decision on interpretation.1\n\nBy letter of 7 October 2016, the Claimants submitted an application for interpretation of the First Award, which was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 21 October 2016. On 12 May 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID issued an order taking note of the discontinuance of the interpretation proceeding pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 44.\n\n5.\n\nBy email dated 4 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Secretary-General of ICSID for four weeks to file its response regarding the proper procedure to be followed in the circumstances presented by the Claimants' submissions.\n\n6.\n\nBy email dated 5 November 2016, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's request for a four-week time limit.\n\n7.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Rectification. By letter dated the same day, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID invited the Parties to submit to the Tribunal their proposals regarding the procedure, conduct and timetable of the rectification proceedings (\"the Rectification Proceedings\").\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 10 November 2016, the Claimants submitted a request for suspension of the Rectification Proceedings, pending disclosure of certain information by Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 16 November 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to indicate by 30 November 2016 whether it consented to the requested rectifications.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 17 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to order the Claimants to submit a Spanish version of the Request for Rectification, and requested a period of at least three weeks following receipt of the Spanish version of the Request for Rectification to consider and submit to the Tribunal its position on the proposed rectifications.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 18 November 2016, the Claimants reiterated to the Tribunal their requests for disclosure dated 27 October 2016 and 10 November 2016.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 21 November 2016, the Tribunal took note of the references in the Request for Rectification to further declarations touching the independence and impartiality of Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder, and communicated to the Parties the fact that the two arbitrators had already responded to the Secretary-General of ICSID on these questions, and had nothing further to add.\n\n13.\n\nBy a second letter dated 21 November 2016, the Tribunal rejected the request filed by the Claimants for the suspension of the Rectification Proceedings. In the same letter, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to provide a Spanish translation of the Request by 2 December 2016, and set the procedural timetable for the Rectification Proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2016, the Claimants proposed the disqualification of Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder (\"the Challenged Arbitrators\") under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (\"the First Disqualification Proposal\").\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 29 November 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were suspended until the First Disqualification Proposal had been decided.\n\n16.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Centre transmitted to the Parties the Decision of the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to dismiss the First Disqualification Proposal. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal notified the Parties that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were resumed on that date.\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 February and 4 March 2017, the Claimants submitted further proposals for the disqualification of Mr. Veeder and subsequently for the disqualification of Sir Franklin Berman under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. By letter of 23 February 2017, the Tribunal notified the Parties that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were once again suspended.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 6 March 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that it was treating the Claimants' further proposals for disqualification as a proposal to disqualify a majority of the Tribunal, to be decided simultaneously by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention (\"the Second Disqualification Proposal\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, the Centre informed the Parties of the Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council to dismiss the Second Disqualification Proposal. By letter dated the same day, the Tribunal notified the Parties that the Rectification Proceedings had resumed with immediate effect.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 18 April 2017, the Tribunal notified the Parties that the procedural arrangements as set out in the letter dated 21 November 2016 would stand, subject to a prolongation of the procedural timetable by twenty (20) weeks to take account of the suspensions of the Rectification Proceedings as set out above.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 21 April 2017, the Claimants communicated a request to the Tribunal for the discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44.\n\n22.\n\nIn an Order dated 24 April 2017, the Tribunal set 1 May 2017 as the date for the Respondent to state its position under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 with respect to the Claimants' request for discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 1 May 2017, the Respondent communicated to the Tribunal its opposition to the request for the discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings, and requested that these Proceedings remain active until the Tribunal had made a determination on the issue of costs.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 3 May 2017, the Tribunal communicated to the Claimants the position of the Respondent in respect of the discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings, and its determination that the Rectification Proceedings would continue as provided in Arbitration Rule 44. In the same letter, the Tribunal requested submission of a Spanish translation of the Request for Rectification by 5 May 2017.\n\n25.\n\nBy email dated 5 May 2017, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties an amended copy of the Decision of 13 April 2017 of the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council dismissing the Second Disqualification Proposal.\n\n26.\n\nBy email dated 5 May 2017, the Claimants submitted the Spanish version of the Request for Rectification.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 10 May 2017, the Respondent requested that its deadline to respond to the Request for Rectification be extended to 9 June 2017.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 15 May 2017, the Tribunal accepted the Respondent's request and adjusted the time limits for the Parties' submissions accordingly.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated 9 June 2017, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose any information not publicly available relating to payments made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile to Essex Court Chambers, that the Tribunal and the Centre investigate this issue and disclose the results of the investigation to all Parties, and that the Tribunal and the Centre take the necessary measures to maintain the possible confidentiality of the information requested.\n\n30.\n\nOn 9 June 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations in response to the Request for Rectification.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter dated 15 June 2017, the Tribunal noted that the Claimants' requests of 9 June 2017 (paragraph 29 above) were placed in a context that had already been considered in the First and Second Disqualification Proposals and their dismissal by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, and informed the Parties of its conclusion that the requests lacked any connection with the rectifications requested, and therefore lay outside its powers and functions in the Rectification Proceedings.\n\n32.\n\nOn 24 June 2017, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal the Spanish version of its observations on the Request for Rectification.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 24 July 2017, the Claimants notified the Tribunal that they did not intend to file a reply to the Respondent's response.\n\n34.\n\nBy email dated 1 August 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the written procedure on the Rectification Proceedings was now closed.\n\n35.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3), the members of the Tribunal have determined that it would not be necessary for them to meet in order to consider the Request for Rectification. The present Decision has been deliberated through several exchanges of written communications among the members of the Tribunal.\n\n36.\n\nIn accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the present Decision constitutes an integral part of the Resubmission Award.\n\n**II. THE CLAIMANTS' REQUESTS FOR RECTIFICATION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants raise four requests for rectification: (1) correction of an erroneous reference to \"Decision No. 43\" in paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award; (2) replacement of the term \"before\" by the term \"by\" in paragraph 61 of the Resubmission Award; (3) replacement of the term \"by\" by the term \"since\" in paragraph 66 of the Resubmission Award; and (4) the removal from point 2 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award of any reference to portions of the First Award that had been annulled, including footnote 387.2\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Request for Rectification also included various matters touching upon the disqualification of the Challenged Arbitrators. As these matters were included in the First and Second Disqualification Proposals and settled by the Chairman's decisions dismissing these proposals, and are in any event outside the competence of the Tribunal in these proceedings, they will not be further considered in the present Decision except in relation to the allocation of costs.\n\n**A. Reference to \"Decision No. 43\" in paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the reference to \"the nullity of Decision No. 43\" in the final sentence of paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award is in error, as the correct reference should be to Chilean Decree No. 165. The Claimants thus request that the relevant paragraph3 of the Resubmission Award should either be corrected to read \"Decree No. 165\" or alternatively deleted in full.4 The Claimants assert in support that the First Award had accepted that they had established their title to the disputed assets.5\n\nIn the Claimants' Request, para. 11, paragraph 199 is mentioned, but in the context of the claim, the Tribunal has interpreted this to be a clerical error, and in fact a reference to paragraph 198.\n\nClaimants' Request, para. 11.\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 5-7.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the reference to Decision No. 43 is in error, and that the correct reference should have been \"Decree No. 165\", but neither accepts the Claimants' arguments as to why the proposed rectification would be necessary, nor the alternative of deleting paragraph 198 in its entirety. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal must respect the nature and limited scope of a rectification proceeding and can only rectify a \"clerical or similar\" error, without engaging in an interpretation of the First Award. It contends further that paragraph 198 is one of the core paragraphs of the First Award, so that to delete it would exceed the scope of the Tribunal's competence in a rectification proceeding.6\n\nRespondent's Observations, paras. 3-6.\n\n**B. Rectification of the term \"before\" in paragraph 61 of the Resubmission Award**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants assert that paragraph 61 of the Resubmission Award incorrectly states that their position in the Resubmission Proceedings was that the validity of Decree No. 165 had never been put into question \"before\" the Chilean courts, and point to paragraph 207 of their Reply of 9 January 2015, which does not use \"*devant*\" (\"before\"), but rather \"*par*\" (\"by\").7 Given that they had in fact made submissions regarding the nullity of Decree No. 165 before the 1st Civil Chamber of Santiago in 1994, the Claimants say that the error might lead to the misleading conclusion that the First Award was reproaching the Claimants for not having raised the question of the nullity of Decree No. 165, when that was not in fact the case.8\n\nClaimants' Request, para. 13\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 14-16.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Claimants' proposed rectification, as it reflects the original terminology used in the Claimants' Reply. It contends, however, that the other justifications raised by the Claimants are unfounded, pointing in particular to the conclusion in paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award that the arguments relating to the status of Decree No. 165 were not relevant to the Resubmission Proceedings, as well as to its earlier submission that the Claimants had never asked for the annulment of Decree No. 165, once they asserted their claims before an international tribunal rather than a Chilean domestic court.9\n\nRespondent's Observations, paras. 10-14.\n\n**C. Rectification of the preposition \"by\" in paragraph 66 of the Resubmission Award**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants say that the use of the preposition *\"par\"* (\"by\") in paragraph 66 of the Resubmission Award is in error, and point in this connection to paragraph 159 of their Reply, which uses the preposition \"*depuis*\" (\"since\") in reference to the denial of justice and its consummation. The Claimants say that the use of the preposition \"by\" would mischaracterize their view that it is not the First Award that consummates the denial of justice, but that the denial of justice has been brought about through the actions of the Respondent.10\n\nClaimants' Request, paras 20-21.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent does not oppose the rectification requested, on the basis that the passage in question resumes the Claimants' Reply, and the Claimants' Reply did make use of the word \"*depuis*\" (\"since\"), but rejects the wider reasons put forward by the Claimants.11\n\nRespondent's Observations, paras. 16-17.\n\n**D. Reference in paragraph 2 of the** ***dispositif*** **of the Resubmission Award to findings of the First Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the reference, in paragraph 2 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award, to paragraph 704 of the First Award is in error, as the paragraph is part of the portion of the First Award that had been annulled; the reference should accordingly be deleted, with a consequential replacement of the possessive \"*sa*\" (\"its\") by \"the\".12\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 25-26.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that paragraph 704 of the First Award was in the portion specified in the Annulment Decision, but submits that the Claimants' proposed rectification could create confusion, and proposes instead the elimination of the words \"as has already been indicated by\" the First Tribunal and the footnote, but not the use of the possessive \"its\".13\n\nRespondent's Observations, paras. 18-19.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered... shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award.*14\n\nWhereas the French version refers generally to \"erreur mat\u00e9rielle,\" the English and Spanish versions are similar to one another in referring more specifically to \"clerical, arithmetical or similar error\" and \"errores materiales, aritm\u00e9ticos o similares del mismo\", respectively.\n\n47.\n\nArbitration Rule 49 outlines the procedure to be followed, but speaks, in its paragraph (1), more generally, of \"*any error in the award which the requesting party seeks to have rectified*.\"\n\n48.\n\nThe wording of the two provisions has in common the reference to an \u2018error' and that the purpose of the procedure is the \u2018rectification' of any such error. Where the texts diverge, the wording of the Convention naturally governs. In order to fall within the rectification procedure, an error must therefore be \"in the award,\" and it must be clerical, or arithmetical, \"or similar.\" The Tribunal notes the differences between the three language versions of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention (see fn 14), which have, however, no significance for the Tribunal's analysis in the circumstances of this case.\n\n49.\n\nIt follows that, as is already implicit in the notion of \u2018rectification,' the procedure does not encompass any alleged mistake of law by the tribunal or any factual determination or discretionary assessment by it. The procedure is not an appeal, and this in turn illuminates why Article 49 of the Convention makes the rectification of any duly established \"clerical, arithmetical or similar error\" into a duty of the tribunal.15\n\nCf. *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on Supplementation and Rectification of 28 May 2003, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, para. 11, citing to CH Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary. A Commentary on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, 2009), *Commentary* to Article 49, para. 47.\n\n50.\n\nPractice has established that there are two, and only two, conditions that must be met for a rectification. First, a clerical, arithmetical or similar error must be found to exist; and secondly, the requested rectification must concern an aspect of the award that is purely accessory to the underlying dispute settled by the award.16\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on Supplementation and Rectification of 28 May 2003, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, para. 25; citing to the earlier *AMCO v. Indonesia*, Decision on Supplemental Decisions and Rectification, 1 ICSID Reports 569, at 638; *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* Rectification of the Award of 31 January 2001, 16 ICSID Rev (2001), at 279; *CDSE v. Republic of Costa Rica*, Decision of 8 June 2000, 15 ICSID Rev. (2000), at 169.\n\n51.\n\nFollowing the (in the event somewhat attenuated) procedure laid down by the Tribunal, it appears that there is no disagreement between the Parties as to the existence of the four errors identified in the Claimants' Request, although they differ as to the appropriate means of correcting them within the scope of the rectification procedure. However that may be, it remains the duty of the Tribunal itself both to ascertain the existence of one or more errors falling within the scope of Article 49 and, if so, to decide how to rectify them. In so doing, it is only the Tribunal itself which can be the authentic judge of its intentions in framing the relevant passages in the Resubmission Award. The Tribunal will therefore examine one by one the four issues raised by the Claimants, in the light of the written comments of the Respondent.\n\n**A. Reference to \"Decision No. 43\" in paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the reference in the last sentence of paragraph 198 to Decision No. 43 was a mistake and that it had intended to refer to Decree No. 165. The error is manifestly a purely clerical one, and will therefore be rectified by replacing the words \"Decision No. 43\" by \"Decree No. 165.\"\n\n**B. Use of the word \"before\" in paragraph 61 of the Resubmission Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the paragraph in question was intended to do no more than reflect the Claimants' submissions in their Reply Memorial, and ought therefore to have employed the Claimants' own wording, namely \"by\" rather than \"before.\" As the error is one of a purely clerical nature, without impact on the substance of the Resubmission Award, the paragraph will be rectified accordingly, by substitution of the word \"by\" in the final sentence.\n\n**C. Use of the word \"by\" in paragraph 66 of the Resubmission Award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that, once again, the paragraph in question was intended to do no more than reflect the Claimants' submissions in their Reply Memorial, and ought therefore to have employed the Claimants' own wording, namely \"since\" rather than \"by.\" As the error is one of a purely clerical nature, without impact on the substance of the Resubmission Award, the paragraph will be rectified accordingly, by substitution of the word \"since\" in the first sentence.\n\n**D. Reference in paragraph 2 of the** ***dispositif*** **of the Resubmission Award to the findings of the First Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it is a matter for debate whether the effect of the Annulment Decision was to annul all of the content of Part VIII of the First Award or only that \"related to damages.\"17 The question is however immaterial to the present matter, as the sole point at issue is the present Tribunal's decision in the Resubmission Award that a finding to the effect that the Claimants had been the victims of a denial of justice constituted in itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the Respondent's breach of Article 4 of the BIT. This constituted an independent finding by the present Tribunal, which is not in itself affected, negatively or positively, by the fact that the First Tribunal had reached a similar conclusion in its own Award, and that it did so on the basis of findings earlier in the First Award which the Annulment Decision had expressly declared to be *res judicata*. The Tribunal therefore sees no imperative need for rectification of the *dispositif*. In the light, however, of the measure of agreement between the Parties that reference ought not to be made to paragraph 704 of the First Award, paragraph 2 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award is rectified to read as follows: \"That the formal recognition by the First Tribunal of the Claimants' rights and its finding that they were the victims of a denial of justice constitutes in itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the Respondent's breach of Article 4 of the BIT;\". With this modification, fn. 387 falls away.\n\nSee Annulment Decision of 18 December 2012, para. 359.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its observations in the Resubmission Award on the allocation of costs, notably in paragraphs 249 and 251. As, pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention, a decision on an application for rectification is to become part of the award, the Tribunal can see no good reason why the same principles should not apply to these Rectification Proceedings as well. It appears from Arbitration Rule 49(4) that a tribunal's powers in respect of costs are the same in both cases.\n\n57.\n\nFor the application of those principles in present circumstances, the proceedings have to be divided into two; one part relates to the request for rectification itself, the other to the two successive proposals for the disqualification of a majority of the Tribunal, both of which fell to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide. As to the latter, factors of relevance to the allocation of costs include the Chairman's findings that the first challenge was out of time, and that the second was without merit. As to the former, although it has, as indicated above, proceeded to make four rectifications to the text of its Resubmission Award pursuant to the obligation laid upon it by Article 49 of the Convention, the Tribunal has nevertheless come to the conclusion that three of the four rectifications concern matters of purely formal import, and that none of the four rectifications has any perceptible impact on the meaning or effect of the Resubmission Award as such.\n\n58.\n\nTaking these factors into account, the Tribunal decides, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) read together with Rule 49(4), that the costs incurred by the Centre in respect of these rectification proceedings, including the costs resulting from the associated challenges to Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder, shall be borne by the Claimants, but makes no further order as to costs.\n\n59.\n\nThese costs amount to (in US$):\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nSir Franklin Berman QC 0\n\nMr V. V. Veeder 0\n\nMr Alexis Mourre 1,875\n\nPresident of the Tribunal's Assistant's fees and expenses 6,370\n\nOther direct expenses (estimated) 5,681.72\n\nICSID's administrative fees 32,000\n\n**Total** **45,926.72**\n\n60.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the Parties in equal parts. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement; any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in equal shares.\n\n61.\n\nIn consequence of paragraphs 56 to 60 above, the costs to be borne by the Claimants amount to US$ 45,926.72, and the Claimants are accordingly under an obligation to reimburse to the Respondent the amount of US$ 22,963.36, in addition to the amount specified in paragraph 255 of the Resubmission Award.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides:\n\n(a) Paragraphs 61,66, and 198, and paragraph 2 of the *dispositif,* of the Resubmission Award are rectified as set out in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, and 55 above.\n\n(b) The costs incurred by the Centre in respect of these Rectification Proceedings, including the costs resulting from the associated challenges to Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder, shall be borne by the Claimants and the Claimants shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$ 22,963.36, in addition to the amount specified in paragraph 255 of the Resubmission Award. The Tribunal makes no further order as to costs."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Request for the Stay of the Enforcement of the Award (Second Annulment Proceeding)", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2018-03-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Request for the Stay of the Enforcement of the Award (Second Annulment Proceeding)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 10 October 2017, Mr. Victor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende (together, the \"**Applicants**\" or the \"**Claimants**\") filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") an application for annulment (the \"**Annulment Application**\") and request for stay of enforcement (the \"**Stay Request**\") in respect to the award rendered on 13 September 2016, as rectified by the decision on rectification of the award dated 6 October 2017 in *Victor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2) (the \"**Resubmission Award**\"). The Annulment Application was filed pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**Convention**\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 20 October 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Application and notified the Applicants and the Republic of Chile (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Chile**\") (together, the \"**Parties**\") that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n3.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"**Committee**\") was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Convention. Its members are: Professor Rolf Knieper (German), serving as President, Professor Nicolas Angelet (Belgian) and Professor Yuejiao Zhang (Chinese). All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n4.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties were informed that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date, and that Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. The Parties were later informed that Ms. Laura Bergamini, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Mr. Garel as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the Applicants submitted a request for the production of certain documents, along with exhibits C-208 through C-212.\n\n6.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties regarding arrangements for the first session and circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the conduct of the proceedings. By the same letter, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties that the Committee had decided to extend the provisional stay of enforcement until it had heard the Parties and made a final determination on the matter, and invited the Respondent to provide its observations on the Stay Request and the Applicants' request for production of documents.\n\n7.\n\nOn 30 December 2017, the Applicants submitted their comments on draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 9 January 2018, the Committee decided to hold a first comprehensive session on 16 February 2018 in person at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. It also decided that, during the first session, the Parties and the Committee would discuss the outstanding procedural issues, the Stay Request and the Applicants' request for production of documents.\n\n9.\n\nOn 19 January 2018, the Respondent submitted its comments on draft Procedural Order No. 1 and its observations on the Stay Request, along with exhibits RA-0001 through RA-0033 and legal authorities RALA-0001 through RALA-12 (the \"**Observations**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 January 2018, the Applicants requested leave to respond to the Respondent's Observations.\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 January 2018, the Committee set forth the time limits for additional written submissions from the Parties on the Stay Request and the Applicants' request for production of documents.\n\n12.\n\nOn 2 February 2018, the Applicants filed their response to the Respondent's Observations along with exhibits C-214 through C-241 (the \"**Response**\"), and submitted further comments on draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n13.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Applicants' Response (the \"**Second Submission**\") along with exhibits RA-0034 and RA-0035, as well as legal authorities RALA-0013 through RALA-0015.\n\n14.\n\nOn 16 February 2018, the Committee held the first session. The Parties and the Members of the Committee discussed draft Procedural Order No. 1. The Parties discussed the Applicants' request for document production and agreed that the procedural timetable would include a document production phase relating to certain documents after the first exchange of briefs. Both Parties then presented oral pleadings on the Applicants' request for the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award, which were recorded and transcribed. Copies of the transcripts in English and French were transmitted to the Parties on 17 and 22 February 2018, respectively.\n\n15.\n\nThis decision sets out the Committee's final determination on the Stay Request.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicants' Request**\n------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Applicants request to \"*suspendre l'ex\u00e9cution de la Sentence de Resoumission jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il se soit prononc\u00e9 sur la Requ\u00eate en annulation, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 52(3) de la Convention.*\"1\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 288.2.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Request**\n-------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent requests that:\n\na. The Committee \"lift the provisional stay of enforcement, reject Claimants' Stay Request, confirm expressly that the Resubmission Award remains binding unless and until it is annulled, and order Claimants to bear all of the costs and legal fees that Chile has incurred in connection with Claimants' Stay Request.\"2\n\nb. The Applicants \"place the USD 182,472.79 that they owe to Chile (pursuant to the Resubmission Award and Rectification Decision) in an interest-bearing escrow account, with all such funds to be released to Chile unless the costs-related part of the Resubmission Award is ultimately annulled by the Committee.\"3\n\nc. The Applicants \"be ordered to request a temporary suspension of the UNCITRAL Proceeding.\"4\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 6.\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 14.\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 14.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS ON THE CONTINUED STAY OF ENFORCEMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of the Applicants' Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the circumstances of the present case require the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award.5\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 281 to 287; Respondent's Second Submission, paras. 20 to 23; Tr. pp. 261-14 to p. 262-20 and p. 280-5:7.\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicants assert in particular that the suspension of the enforcement of the totality of the Resubmission Award is indispensable in order to guarantee the *res iudicata* effect of the first Award rendered on 8 May 2008 and thereby the Respondent's obligation to compensate financially the Applicants' damages caused through the violations of the fair and equitable standard obligations and the continued possession of the Applicants' assets in Chile.6\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 281 to 283 and 287; Applicants' Response, para. 22.\n\n20.\n\nThe Applicants do not contest the binding character of the Resubmission Award but \"make a difference with the binding and *res iudicata*.\"7 They submit that \"*conform\u00e9ment aux articles 52 et 53(1) de la Convention, le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif de la Sentence en Resoumission ne peut \u00eatre affirm\u00e9 d\u00e8s lors que celle-ci fait l'objet d'un recours en annulation*.\"8\n\nTr. p. 276-9:10.\n\nApplicants' Response, para. 23.\n\n21.\n\nFurther, they submit that the request for a continued stay of the totality of the Resubmission Award necessarily encompasses the Applicants' condemnation to reimburse part of the costs that the Respondent has incurred during the resubmission proceeding.9\n\nApplicants' Response, para. 21; Tr. p. 258-2:8 and p. 279-4:10.\n\n22.\n\nThey allege that, as found by the *ad hoc* committee in *Libananco v. Turkey*, it is not necessary that the award underlying the request for annulment (as well as the stay of enforcement) provide for a pecuniary compensation for damages in order to trigger a stay. The committee granted the stay because the applicant had been ordered to pay the costs of the proceeding.10\n\nApplicants' Response, para. 21; the Applicants refer to *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 May 2012.\n\n23.\n\nThe Applicants submit that *ad hoc* committees have \"almost systematically granted [a stay] except for exceptional circumstances\" and refer in this context to the decision on the first request of annulment.11\n\nTr. p. 261-15:21 and p. 280-2:5.\n\n24.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, exceptional circumstances do not exist that would justify not granting the stay.\n\n25.\n\nFirst of all, there is no risk that the Applicants will not honour their financial obligations should their request for annulment be rejected. The Applicants have consistently performed their obligations and will continue to do so.12\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 287.5; Tr. p. 261:15-22 to p. 262-1.\n\n26.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee should take into account that the proceedings have lasted for 20 years and that all the costs have been borne by a private person and a not-for-profit foundation, despite the fact that their assets have been confiscated by and are still in the possession of the Respondent.13\n\nTr. p. 279-8:16.\n\n27.\n\nChile will suffer no harm from the suspension of the enforcement.14\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 287.4.\n\n28.\n\nOn the other hand, the Applicants would be prejudiced by the reimbursement of the costs to the Respondent firstly because it is very burdensome for Mr. Pey and for the Foundation, and secondly because they have experience with Chile being extremely slow and reluctant to honour its financial obligations towards them.15 The Applicants submit that the Respondent has already asked them to be reimbursed.16\n\nTr. p. 279-8:16 and p. 288-11:18.\n\nTr. p. 279-7.\n\n29.\n\nFinally, neither the request for the annulment of the award nor for the stay are motivated by dilatory intentions.17 The Respondent's allegation that these requests aim at gaining time (in order to proceed with the parallel UNCITRAL arbitration) is completely speculative and fictitious since the UNCITRAL proceeding concerns a different subject matter, unrelated to the present dispute. The UNCITRAL case relates to violations of the Respondent's international obligations that have occurred after the first Award and that the Resubmission Award has explicitly refused to ascertain. Therefore, a possible stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award is irrelevant to the UNCITRAL proceeding.18\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 287.6.\n\nTr. p. 262-16 to p. 264-11.\n\n**B. Summary of the Respondent's Position**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Stay Request for several interrelated reasons.\n\n31.\n\nFirstly, the Respondent submits that the Applicants have not requested the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award as required by Arbitration Rule 54(2). The Respondent relies on Schreuer's Commentary of the ICSID Convention, which explains:\n\nOnce the *ad hoc* Committee is constituted, the Party seeking a stay of enforcement must direct its request to the Committee. If a provisional stay has been obtained, the Party that wishes to have the stay continued must direct a request to that effect to the *ad hoc* Committee. Otherwise, the stay will be terminated automatically (Arbitration Rule 54(2)).19\n\nC.H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention - A Commentary, 2nd edition, 2009, Article 52, para. 586; Tr. p. 28213:22 and p. 283-1.\n\n32.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent asserts that the provisional stay of the enforcement, which the Secretary-General has notified to the Parties, was automatically terminated in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2).20\n\nTr. p. 272-15 to p. 273-3\n\n33.\n\nFurther, the Respondent asserts that the request for the stay is improper since in reality it does not address the possible enforcement of the Resubmission Award but \"focuses exclusively on the legal status of the Resubmission Award. Thus, the 'stay' that Claimants seek is a suspension - during the pendency of this Second Annulment Proceeding - of the binding nature of the Resubmission Award's findings and conclusions.\"21\n\nRespondent's Observations, pp. 10 s. (footnote omitted).\n\n34.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent asserts that \"enforcement\" is a specific process which applies only to enforceable obligations without affecting the overall binding character of an award.22\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 12.\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"a stay of enforcement, as its name indicates, operates to stay enforcement, which only applies to 'the pecuniary obligations imposed by [an] award'\" (see Article 54(1) of the Convention). In the present case, \"[t]hese obligations are restricted to the costs that the Resubmission Award on the Applicants.'\"23 \"Typically, however, stays of enforcement are not requested unless there is an award of pecuniary damages at stake.\"24 Of the 23 publicly available decisions on stay of enforcement, only one decision - rendered in the *Libananco v. Turkey* case - relates to a case where no damages were awarded and the stay targeted the tribunal's order on costs. The Respondent relies on Schreuer, who explains:25\n\nIn *Klockner I,* the Award had rejected both the claim and the counter-claim. Consequently, there was no opportunity for a stay of enforcement. In *Vivendi I*, the Tribunal had declined to rule on the merits of the claims arising out of the conduct of the Province of Tucuman, so there was no part of the Award's *dispositif* that warranted a stay. In *Soufraki v. UAE*, the Tribunal had ruled that it lacked jurisdiction so, again, there was no call for a stay of enforcement. Likewise, in *Lucchetti v. Peru*, it was the Claimant that sought annulment of an Award that had concluded that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction. In such circumstances, a stay of enforcement is inappropriate.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 3, quoting the ICSID letter dated 23 January 2018.\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 9.\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 9.\n\n36.\n\nFurther, the Respondent refers to Article 52(5) of the Convention and asserts that a stay of enforcement of an award is not a trivial matter. The Applicants bear the burden of proving that the circumstances require a stay. The Respondent relies on the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *OI v. Venezuela*, which found:\n\n[t]he aforementioned provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules lead this *ad hoc* Committee to a fundamental conclusion, set forth at the outset, that the continuation of the stay of enforcement in the ICSID system is far from automatic. ICSID Convention Article 52(5) provides that the stay shall continue if an *ad hoc* committee considers that \"the circumstances so require.\" Said article does not use other less categorical verbs, such as \"recommend,\" \"deserve,\" \"justify\" or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb \"require.\"26\n\n*OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25), Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 4 April 2016, para. 89.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Stay Request is driven by dilatory intentions and is abusive. In particular, the request for annulment and the Stay Request must be considered in a wider context and in light of the new claim that the Applicants have brought under the UNCITRAL rules on the same subject matter. The improper intention behind the Annulment Application and the Stay Request is to convince the UNCITRAL tribunal to disregard this proceeding and the binding character of the Resubmission Award, and allow the re-litigation of the dispute.27 In order to avoid parallel proceedings, the Respondent requests that the Committee order a temporary suspension of the UNCITRAL proceeding.28\n\nRespondent's Observations, pp. 7 and 13; Respondent's Second Submission, para. 3; Tr. p. 266-1 to p. 268-10.\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 14.\n\n38.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent submits that there is a real risk that the Applicants will not comply with the Resubmission Award, as evidenced by the fact that the Applicants have explicitly refused to pay the costs awarded in the Resubmission Award at a time when the enforcement of the Award was not stayed. The Respondent adds that it is \"entitled to the benefits of immediate payment\" of the Resubmission Award and that, in the event the stay is continued, \"the only way to preserve those benefits for Chile would be through the granting of interest.\"29 Accordingly, the Respondent requests that, if the Committee decides to uphold the Stay Request, the Applicants be ordered to place an amount corresponding to the costs awarded in the Resubmission Award into an interest-bearing escrow account.30\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 14; the Respondent quotes *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision of Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 5 May 2009, para. 27.\n\nRespondent's Observations, pp. 13 and 14.\n\n39.\n\nFinally, the Respondent refutes the Applicants' allegation that the Respondent would not reimburse the costs if the Resubmission Award is annulled. There is no risk that the Applicants will not be reimbursed if their request for annulment is upheld.31\n\nTr. p. 289-18 to p. 290-19.\n\n**IV.** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Committee recalls that in accordance with Article 53(1) of the Convention, an award is \"binding\" on the parties and is not subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the Convention. Further, each party shall \"abide by and comply with\" the award \"except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed.\"\n\n41.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention, an *ad hoc* committee \"may\" stay the \"enforcement\" of an award \"if it considers that the circumstances so require.\" The party that requests the stay has to specify these circumstances in its application (Arbitration Rule 54(4)).\n\n42.\n\nNeither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules identify the circumstances in which a stay of enforcement may be granted, or specify the criteria that committees should apply to assess the relevance of such circumstances and their relative weight. Their determination is left to the *ad hoc* committees' \"broad discretion,\" as expressed by the term \"may\" in Article 52(5) of the Convention and as it is generally accepted.\n\n43.\n\nThe Committee further recalls that it has decided to continue the provisional stay, which the Parties were notified of by the Secretary-General.32 The Secretary-General's notification was an administrative act based on Arbitration Rule 54(2), which was adopted without analyzing the merits of the application. The Committee simply extended the stay in its original provisional form, again without analyzing the merits, in order to give each Party the opportunity to present its observations before rendering a reasoned decision as required by Arbitration Rule 54(4).\n\nICSID letter dated 22 December 2018.\n\n44.\n\nAs a consequence of the Committee's decision, Arbitration Rule 54(2) does not apply and the provisional stay is not automatically terminated, as suggested by the Respondent, but continued \"until the Committee rules on such request,\" as unequivocally provided for in Article 52(5) of the Convention.\n\n45.\n\nThe Applicants request that the Committee order the stay of the enforcement of the totality of the Resubmission Award. When asked by the Committee,33 the Applicants confirmed that their Stay Request encompasses the obligation to reimburse certain costs to the Respondent. As noted above, the Respondent objects to the Applicants' Stay Request, arguing that the Resubmission Award does not impose pecuniary obligations on the Applicants- except for the costs - and therefore there is nothing in the Resubmission Award which can be enforced or stayed.\n\nICSID letter dated 23 January 2018.\n\n46.\n\nIn the award rendered on 13 September 2016, the Tribunal decided:\n\n1) That Ms Coral Pey Grebe cannot be regarded as a claimant in her own right in these resubmission proceedings;\n\n2) That, as has already been indicated by the First Tribunal, its formal recognition of the Claimants' rights and its finding that they were the victims of a denial of justice constitutes in itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the Respondent's breach of Article 4 of the BIT;\n\n3) That the Claimants, bearing the relevant burden of proof, have failed to prove any further quantifiable injury to themselves caused by the breach of Article 4 as found by the First Tribunal in its Award;\n\n4) That the Tribunal cannot therefore make any award to the Claimants of financial compensation on this account;\n\n5) That the Claimants' subsidiary claim on the basis of unjust enrichment is without legal foundation;\n\n6) That there are no grounds in the circumstances of the case for the award of moral damages either to Mr Pey Casado or to the Foundation;\n\n7) That the arbitration costs of these resubmission proceedings are to be shared in the proportion of three quarters to be borne by the Claimants and one quarter by the Respondent, with the result that the Claimants shall reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$159,509.43;\n\n8) That all other claims are dismissed.34\n\nResubmission Award, para. 255.\n\n47.\n\nIn its decision on rectification of the award, the Tribunal decided:\n\n(a) Paragraphs 61, 66, and 198, and paragraph 2 of the *dispositif*, of the Resubmission Award are rectified as set out in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, and 55 above.\n\n(b) The costs incurred by the Centre in respect to the Rectification Proceedings, including the costs resulting from the associated challenges to Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder, shall be borne by the Claimants and the Claimants shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$ 22,963.36, in addition to the amount specified in paragraph 255 of the Resubmission Award. The Tribunal makes no further order as to costs.35\n\nDecision on rectification of the award of 6 October 2017, para. 62.\n\n48.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the Convention provides:\n\nThe award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n49.\n\nArticle 54(1) of the Convention adds:\n\nEach Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.\n\n50.\n\nThe Committee interprets these provisions in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It provides:\n\nA treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n51.\n\nThe application of this rule of interpretation bears out that Article 53 of the Convention leaves the binding character of the award untouched, until and unless the award is annulled.\n\n52.\n\nThis follows, first, from the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 53 of the Convention. Article 53(1)'s first sentence is concerned with the \"binding\" nature of the award. The second sentence of Article 53(1) further provides that each party shall \"abide by and comply\" with the terms of the award except to the extent that \"enforcement\" shall have been stayed. It follows from these terms that, while a stay of enforcement suspends a party's obligation to abide by and comply with the award (that is to say, to implement it), the stay of the enforcement does not suspend the binding force of the award. It also follows from the provision's terms that all that can be stayed is the enforcement of the award.\n\n53.\n\nThis is further confirmed by the object and purpose of the Convention and its relevant provisions. The stay of enforcement is embedded in the wider and self-contained system of possible remedies against ICSID awards and in the right of a party to test before an annulment committee its good faith conviction that the award is fundamentally flawed under Article 52 of the Convention (either because the tribunal was improperly constituted or even corrupted, or because the tribunal acted in manifest excess of its powers, violated fundamental rules of due process or failed to give reasons for its decision).\n\n54.\n\nArticle 52 of the Convention is concerned with the integrity of ICSID arbitration proceedings and seeks to reconcile the finality of the award with the need to prevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.\n\n55.\n\nArticle 53 of the Convention provides that the award is not subject to an appeal procedure by a superior adjudication body with the powers to scrutinize the merits of the award, suspend its binding effect during the appeal phase or issue a new decision that replaces the original award. The drafters of the Convention have opted against such a mechanism and in favour of a restricted review mechanism, which leaves the binding character of the award untouched until and unless the award is annulled because of fundamental flaws.\n\n56.\n\nIn contrast to an appeal body, an annulment committee does not have the power to replace an annulled award by \"its own decision on the merits; it can extinguish a *res iudicata* but it cannot create a new one.\"36 Rather, a new decision may only be rendered by a new tribunal if one of the parties so requests (Article 52(6) of the Convention).\n\nC.H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention - A Commentary, 2nd edition, 2009, Article 52, para. 491.\n\n57.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the Convention exempts a party from complying with the obligations imposed by an award to the extent that the enforcement of those obligations is stayed. The provision does not revoke the binding character of the award but allows an order to inhibit the other party from enforcing the rights that the award has granted, despite its ongoing binding character. The stay of enforcement does not stay the effect of the award. It can be modified or terminated at any moment at the discretion of the *ad hoc* committee (Arbitration Rule 54(3)).\n\n58.\n\nAccordingly, in light of all the above, the Committee finds that the binding force of an ICSID award cannot be stayed pending an annulment proceeding. The award remains necessarily binding (in French, \"*obligatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des parties*\") and its *res iudicata* effect remains untouched, until and unless the award is annulled. Neither the wording of the Convention nor its object and purpose allow a distinction between the binding character and the *res iudicata* effect of an ICSID award, as suggested by the Applicants.\n\n59.\n\nIt thereby follows that the Applicants' objective, as the Committee understands it, to restore the *res iudicata* effect of the initial award of 2008, cannot be achieved through the request for annulment of the Resubmission Award and even less through the Stay Request. The only possible effect of an annulment decision would be in fact the extinction of the *res iudicata* of the Resubmission Award, and not the automatic reestablishment of the binding force of the annulled parts of the initial award.\n\n60.\n\nThe Parties have discussed whether the Resubmission Award lends itself to a stay of enforcement. For that matter, the decisive question is whether the award has conferred rights to the Respondent that it could enforce against the Applicants if the Respondent were not hindered by a stay.\n\n61.\n\nThe dispositive part of the Resubmission Award has determined the status of Ms. Coral Pey Grebe; it has confirmed that the Respondent has violated its obligation not to treat the Applicants unfairly; it has rejected a claim for pecuniary compensation for want of proof; it has rejected claims for unjust enrichment and moral damages; it has ordered the Applicants to reimburse part of the costs to the Respondent. The dispositive part of the decision on rectification has corrected certain paragraphs of the Resubmission Award and ordered the Applicants to reimburse costs to the Respondent.\n\n62.\n\nExcept for the decisions on costs, none of the above-mentioned determinations confer rights to the Respondent that it could enforce. Accordingly, a stay of the enforcement of paragraphs 1 to 5 and 7 of the *dispositif* of the award rendered on 13 September 2016, and paragraph 1 of the *dispositif* of the decision on rectification, would be futile and is not warranted.\n\n63.\n\nTherefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants' request to continue the stay of the enforcement of paragraphs 1 to 5 and 7 of the *dispositif* of the award rendered on 13 September 2016, and paragraph 1 of the *dispositif* of the decision on rectification.\n\n64.\n\nThis decision is confirmed (rather than contradicted) by the committee's decision in *Libananco v. Turkey*. In that case, the applicant seemingly recognized that a request for a stay of the enforcement of the tribunal's findings on jurisdiction would be futile because those findings did not establish enforceable rights. Accordingly, the applicant did not request the stay of the enforcement of those findings but limited its request to the part of the *dispositif* that imposed on it the obligation to reimburse costs to the Respondent.37\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 May 2012, para. 11.\n\n65.\n\nThe committee in *Libananco v. Turkey* decided that the stay was warranted because the applicant \"has a clear interest in obtaining a continued stay of enforcement of the order on reimbursement and cost compensation, this being an interest which should be balanced against the Respondent's interest in enforcing this part of the Award at an early point in time.\" In balancing the interests of both parties, the committee was of the view that the applicant's \"interest in a continued stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceeding should be given more weight than the Respondent's interest in immediate enforcement.\"38\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 May 2012, paras. 47 and 54.\n\n66.\n\nThis Committee shares the *Libananco v. Turkey*'s committee's opinion that the enforcement of an order to reimburse costs may be stayed even if the other parts of the *dispositif* of the award are not enforceable and thus cannot be stayed.\n\n67.\n\nAs provided by Article 52(5) of the Convention, the Committee has to exercise its discretion when deciding whether and to what extent to grant a request for a stay.\n\n68.\n\nIn taking its decision, the Committee will have regard to the specific factual circumstances of the present case and to previous practice of *ad hoc* committees, although it is not bound by rules of precedent. In this respect, the Applicants refer to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in the first annulment proceeding, which found:\n\nTurning first to the Republic's Request that the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued pending its decision on the Application, the Committee notes that, although Article 52(5) of the Convention uses the verb \"may\", thereby conveying an element of discretion to the Committee, a review of the many decisions by *ad hoc* annulment committees since the MINE decision in 1988 leads the Committee to the conclusion that, absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee is satisfied that the Republic has discharged its burden of proving that there are no unusual circumstances and that all the factors which the Republic has referred to support the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the Committee's decision and it so rules.39\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and Foundation Presidente Allende v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on the Republic of Chile's Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 5 May 2010, paras. 25 s. (footnotes omitted).\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent points to decisions that contradict the approach quoted above, and argues as follows:\n\nWe heard Claimant's counsel say that suspension--that the stays are systematically granted except for exceptional circumstances, and while it's true that for a long time stays were, in fact, granted routinely, if you focus only on the jurisprudence of the last 5 or 10 years, you will find that actually a majority of the decisions have, in fact, either lifted the stay or have imposed conditions.40\n\nTr. p. 283-9:17.\n\n70.\n\nThe Committee has taken note of the difference in opinion of different committees. The Committee observes that, indeed, in recent years some committees have taken a more restrictive approach in exercising their discretion, although the majority still lean toward the approach adopted by the first annulment committee in the present dispute.\n\n71.\n\nAlthough not being bound, the Committee cannot ignore that there has been a reasoned decision in the present case granting stay of enforcement in favour of the Respondent. The respect for procedural fairness and equality provides strong arguments for accepting the first committee's approach in the present phase of the proceeding and applying an interpretative standard for the exercise of the Committee's discretion, which does not put the Applicants in a less favourable position than the Respondent in the previous annulment proceeding.\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee is even more willing to follow this approach because it believes that it would be inappropriate to reject a request for a stay when the applicant pursues its legitimate right to have the award examined for fundamental institutional and procedural propriety in good faith and absent dilatory intentions.\n\n73.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Committee will weigh the interests of the Parties and examine whether unusual circumstances exist that require the termination of the stay of the enforcement.\n\n74.\n\nThe Applicants submit that they have always honored their financial obligations and have the firm intention to continue to do so. Further, they stress the financial burden that this case has put on a private claimant and a foundation, and note that the Respondent will suffer no harm from the postponement of the payment until the possible rejection of the Annulment Request. The Respondent objects to this statement and refers to an exchange of correspondence confirming that in February 2017, the Applicants refused to reimburse the costs of the resubmission proceeding, even though the enforcement of the Resubmission Award had not yet been stayed at that time.41\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 13.\n\n75.\n\nThe Committee has weighed these arguments and finds that the balance tips in favour of the Applicants. In fact, the Applicants have conducted these proceedings for 20 years without repudiating the obligations that were placed on them. Their refusal to pay the costs of the Resubmission Award before the stay of its enforcement does not constitute a repudiation that should cause the Committee to consider otherwise. The Committee does not see a major risk for the Respondent that the Applicants will not finally pay the costs if the annulment decision should be in the Respondent's favour. At the same time, the actual costs of the annulment proceeding put a burden on the Applicants that would be aggravated by the immediate reimbursement of the costs for the resubmission proceeding. Further, the Parties have agreed to a procedural calendar that will allow this proceeding to conclude in an appropriate period.\n\n76.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that the requests for annulment and for stay of the enforcement have been introduced with dilatory intentions in an attempt to \"game the system\" (as their objectives is not to obtain the annulment of the Resubmission Award but convince the UNCITRAL tribunal that the Resubmission Award is not binding).42 The Respondent requests that the Committee order the Applicants to suspend the UNCITRAL proceeding temporarily.\n\nTr. p 264-1:7; Chile's first session power-point presentation, slide 15.\n\n77.\n\nThe Committee observes that the need for the Committee to take measures so as to prevent the Applicants from using a stay of enforcement in the present proceedings to argue in the context of the UNCITRAL proceeding that the Resubmission Award is not binding, has become moot in the light of its previous findings regarding the binding nature of the Resubmission Award, the effects of a request for annulment and for a stay of enforcement. These findings suffice to prevent the Committee's decision on the Stay Request from being used in the way feared by the Respondent.\n\n78.\n\nIn addition, the Applicants argue that the UNCITRAL proceedings concern a subject matter which the Tribunal had explicitly refused to treat, as explained in paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award. The Committee sees benefit in quoting this part of the Resubmission Award in its entirety:\n\nThe Tribunal should also interpolate at this point that part of the argument addressed to it by the Claimants in these resubmission proceedings was to the effect that the actions of the Respondent, since the handing down of the First Award, constituted a new denial of justice for which compensation is due, and can be awarded in these resubmission proceedings. This is an argument that the Tribunal must reject outright. The reason is not only that allegations of that kind would have to be subjected to a proper process of evidence and proof before they could properly come to decision in an arbitral process (which indeed they would); it is quite simply that the entire argument falls plainly outside the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal, which (as already indicated) is limited, under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 55 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, exclusively to 'the dispute' or such parts of it as remain in being after the annulment. That can only be taken to refer to 'the dispute' that had been submitted to arbitration in the first place, the critical date for which was the Claimants' original request for arbitration. Issues arising between the Parties after that date - and still more so issues arising out of post-Award conduct - cannot by any stretch of the imagination fall within the scope of resubmission proceedings under the provisions cited above, and the Tribunal sees no need to say more about the matter in this Award.43\n\nResubmission Award, para. 216.\n\n79.\n\nThe Committee confirms that the effects of *res iudicata* and *lis pendens* foreclose the Applicants from activating \"any other remedy\" in connection with the claims that were brought to ICSID arbitration as explicitly provided for in Article 26 of the Convention. The Applicants are thus precluded from presenting the same claims brought in this case to another national or international adjudication body and such body should reject such claims for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n80.\n\nHowever, these principles do not apply to new claims, i.e. for claims allegedly resulting from BIT breaches that have occurred after the arbitral proceedings in the present case were initiated. In the words of the Tribunal in the resubmission proceeding, \"the critical date\" is the Claimants' original request for arbitration, *i*. *e*. 3 November 1997.\n\n81.\n\nTo the extent that the UNCITRAL proceeding concerns such new claims, the Committee does not find support for concluding that the Annulment Application and the Stay Request were filed for dilatory reasons. At the same time, the Committee notes that, in accordance with Article 26 Convention, the Parties have consented to exclude the pursuit of any other remedy (including an UNCITRAL arbitration) for the claims which were brought in this case. Accordingly, the Committee invites the Parties not to pursue claims identical to those brought in these arbitration proceedings before any other national or international adjudication body.\n\n82.\n\nIn conclusion of the foregoing, the Committee decides to continue the stay of the enforcement regarding the costs awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent requests that, in the event the stay is continued, the Committee order the Applicants to place the total amount of the costs, *i*. *e*. USD 182,472.79, in an interestbearing escrow account. The Applicants object to this request.\n\n84.\n\nThe Committee has no doubt that it has the power to condition the stay of the enforcement, if and to the extent such condition is warranted.\n\n85.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent argues that the requested security is necessary because the Respondent is \"entitled to the benefits of immediate payment\" of the Resubmission Award and, if the stay is continued, \"the only way to preserve those benefits for Chile would be through the granting of interest.\"44\n\nRespondent's Observations, p. 14.\n\n86.\n\nHowever, the Committee considers that the Applicants' obligation to make an immediate payment in favour of the Respondent does not exist if a stay of enforcement is granted, as is the case here.\n\n87.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent's claim for the preservation of the economic value of its claim for costs depends on the outcome of the present annulment proceedings and, if applicable, new proceedings on the merits. Depending on the outcome of the proceeding, the claim for interests on the costs may either be moot, or may be made the subject matter of a specific ascertainment.\n\n88.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent's request to condition the stay is rejected.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Committee orders the Applicants to bear all of the costs and legal fees that Chile has incurred in connection with the Stay Request. The Applicants have not made an application on costs.\n\n90.\n\nThe Committee reserves the matter for determination together with the decision on the Annulment Application.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n91.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee decides and declares as follows:\n\na. The stay of enforcement of paragraphs 1 to 5 and 7 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award and paragraph 1 of the *dispositif* of the decision on rectification is lifted;\n\nb. The stay of enforcement of paragraph 6 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award and paragraph 2 of the *dispositif* of the decision on rectification is unconditionally continued;\n\nc. The decision on the allocation of costs is reserved until the final decision on the Annulment Application; and\n\nd.

ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n4.\n\nIn paragraph 52 of the Stay Decision, the Committee found that under Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention annulment committees can only stay the \"enforcement of the award\" and not its \"binding force.\"3\n\nStay Decision, para. 52.\n\n5.\n\nAccordingly, in paragraph 60 of the Stay Decision, the Committee noted that \"the decisive question\" in order to decide whether the Resubmission Award \"lends itself to a stay of enforcement [...] is whether the award has conferred rights to the Respondent that it could enforce against the Applicants if the Respondent were not hindered by a stay.\"4\n\nStay Decision, para. 60.\n\n6.\n\nIn paragraph 62 of the Stay Decision, the Committee found that \"except for the decisions on costs, none of the [...] determinations\" in the Resubmission Award and in the rectification decision \"confer rights to the Respondent that it could enforce.\" Accordingly, in paragraph 82 of the Stay Decision, the Committee clarified that it \"decides to continue the stay of the enforcement regarding the costs awarded by the Tribunal.\"5\n\nStay Decision, para. 82.\n\n7.\n\nIn light of these findings, it appears clear that, in paragraphs 62, 63 and 91 of the Stay Decision, the Committee intended to stay the enforcement of the determinations on costs contained in paragraphs 7 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award and 62(b) of the decision on rectification,6 and not the enforcement of paragraph 6 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award (that does not confer any \"rights to the Respondent that it could enforce\").\n\nQuoted in paragraphs 46 and 47 of the Stay Decision.\n\n**III.

In this opinion, I wish briefly to explain why I do not subscribe to the reasons set out in the Committee\u2019s Decision as concerns the interpretation of the First Annulment Decision regarding the *res iudicata* effect of paragraph 688 of the First Award, and why this leaves the Committee\u2019s decision to reject the Application unaffected. I write this opinion with much esteem for the different view of my colleagues in the Committee on this truly complex issue.\n\n**Paragraph 688 of the First Award and the Committee\u2019s Decision**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nAt paragraph 688 of the First Award, the First Tribunal reasoned that since the expropriation fell outside the scope of application of the BIT, the allegations and evidence regarding the damage caused by the expropriation were not relevant and could not be relied upon in order to establish the damage caused by the denial of justice and the failure to accord fair and equitable treatment:\n\n*688.

According to the Committee\u2019s Decision, the First Committee thus made the content of paragraph 688 its own. In this light, toe First Committee\u2019s decision in dispositive paragraph 1 to annul \"the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)\" must be interpreted as meaning that only the paragraphs that adjudicate compensation for damages resulting from the denial of justice and the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard by referring to the standard of expropriation are concerned. By contrast, the statement in paragraph 688 of the First Award that the damage caused by the denial of justice and the violation of fair and equitable treatment cannot be calculated by reference to the expropriation, would *be res iudicata1* The Decision proceeds with noting that some ambiguities notwithstanding, the Resubmission Tribunal essentially took the same position.2\n\nDecision of the Committee (hereafter: \"Decision\") at paras. 623-626. See also paras. 659 ss.\n\nDecision, para. 626, referring to the Resubmission Award at paras. 228 and 230(d).\n\n4.\n\nFor the reasons set out hereafter, I regard this finding as incompatible with the relevant passages of the First Committee\u2019s Decision.\n\n**The Dispositive Paragraphs of the First Annulment Decision**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s reasoning starts from the *dispositif* of the First Annulment Decision. The Committee observes that there has been some discussion between the Parties as to the meaning of dispositive paragraph 1 of the First Annulment Decision, which annuls paragraph 4 of the First Award and the \"corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)\" - in the French version: *\"et les paragraphes correspondants dans le corps de la Sentence relatifs aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats (Section VIII)\"*.3 The question is whether this covers the entirety or only a part of Section VIII.\n\nDecision, para. 623. See also para. 625, which also mentions paragraph 4 of the *dispositif.*\n\n6.\n\nDispositive paragraph 1 is arguably ambiguous because of the reference it makes to the \"corresponding paragraphs [...] related to damages\" before mentioning Section VIII between brackets. This may be interpreted as referring to the whole of Section VIII or only to some paragraphs thereof.\n\n7.\n\nHowever, dispositive paragraph 1 of the First Annulment Decision must be read in conjunction with dispositive paragraph 4. Whereas paragraph 1 enunciates the scope of annulment of the First Award, paragraph 4 enunciates what in the First Award is *res iudicata.* Paragraph 4 is the mirror image of paragraph 1. It is bound to say exactly the same in the opposite terms.\n\n8.\n\nIn dispositive paragraph 4, the First Committee finds that \"paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 of the *dispositif* as well as the body of the Award but for Section VIII are *res judicata* \u2014 in French: *\"les paragraphes 1 \u00e0 3 et 5 \u00e0 8 du dispositif ainsi que le corps de la Sentence, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la Section VIII, ont autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e\".* The terms \"but for Section VIII\" and *\"\u00e0 l\u2019exception de la Section VIII*\" unambiguously mean that Section VIII as a whole is not *res iudicata*.\n\n9.\n\nTherefore, any ambiguity dispositive paragraph 1 may be tainted with is dispelled by paragraph 4.\n\n**The Reasons of the First Annulment Decision**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s Decision does not focus on operative paragraph 4 of the First Annulment Decision but rather on its reasons. The Committee's Decision states that paragraph 688 of the First Award is quoted affirmatively in paragraphs 261 and 283 of the First Annulment Decision, with the consequence that the First Committee made the content of paragraph 688 its own. It would follow that dispositive paragraph 1 must be read as meaning that not all of the reasons in Section VIII are annulled.4 In my submission, this conclusion is not sustained by paragraphs 261 and 283 of the First Annulment Decision, and it is further contradicted by paragraph 286 thereof.\n\nDecision, para. 624.\n\n11.\n\nParagraph 261 of the First Annulment Decision is concerned with whether the First Tribunal violated Chile\u2019s right to be heard by valuating damages without having heard the Parties on the valuation method applied. In that context, the First Committee observed that the First Tribunal \"acknowledged in the Award\" (\"a *reconnu dans la Sentence\")* that (i) the Claimants\u2019 damages arguments were strictly limited to then-expropriation, (ii) the expropriation-based calculation of damages was not relevant to the BIT violations in terms of denial of justice and discrimination forming the basis of the Award, (iii) Claimants presented no convincing evidence of damages on the denial of justice or discrimination claims and (iv) the First Tribunal would be able to proceed to the evaluation of the damages based on objective elements, the Chilean authorities having themselves fixed the amount of compensation due to persons entitled to be indemnified under Decision No. 43 (i.e. the Chilean domestic law decision granting compensation for expropriation to Chilean persons who wrongfully alleged being the owners of the Applicants\u2019 assets). The First Committee then reasoned in paragraph 262 that even if *arguendo* the First Tribunal had the power to calculate the Applicants\u2019 damage on this basis, it should have heard the Parties in that respect.\n\n12.\n\nNothing in this passage indicates that the First Committee thereby \"made the content of paragraph 688 its own\". I have considered that such appropriation might be inferred from the use of the term \u2018acknowledged\u2019, when the First Committee lists the various points the First Tribunal \"acknowledged\" in the First Award. The term could imply a validation of what the First Tribunal did. This argument, however, proves too much, because the \u2018acknowledgment\u2019 not only applies to the decision that the expropriation-based calculation of damages was not relevant to the denial of justice and breach of fair and equitable treatment (second indent), but also to the contradictory decision that damages could be calculated by reference to the expropriation value pursuant to Decision No. 43 (fourth indent). It follows that nothing in paragraph 261 of the First Annulment Decision indicates that the First Committee made paragraph 688 of the First Award its own. The First Committee merely summarised the First Tribunal\u2019s reasons.\n\n13.\n\nParagraph 283 of the First Annulment Decision is, in turn, concerned with whether the First Award\u2019s reasons regarding the valuation of damages were contradictory. In paragraph 282, the First Committee announced that it agreed with Chile that the First Tribunal\u2019s valuation of the damages by reference to the Chilean Decision No. 43 -which was for expropriation - was incompatible with the First Tribunal\u2019s prior decision that the valuation of damages caused by expropriation was not relevant for the valuation of damages due to the denial of justice and the breach of fair and equitable treatment. The First Committee then recalled the reasons in paragraph 688 of the First Award (\u00a7283) and confronted them with the valuation of damages by reference to Chilean Decision No. 43 (\u00a7284) before reiterating its conclusion that the reasons were contradictory (\u00a7285). Again, the First Committee did not thereby \"made paragraph 688 its own\" but merely presented the contradiction.\n\n14.\n\nImportantly, the First Committee then specified in paragraph 286 that the problem lied specifically in the contradictory reasoning, and not as such in the quantum of damages, nor in the method applied by the First Tribunal to calculate the damages:\n\n[...] the issue in the present case is not *per se* the quantum of damages determined by the Tribunal. *Nor does the problem lie* per se *in the Tribunal\u2019s chosen method of calculating the damages suffered by the Claimants.* The issue lies precisely in the reasoning followed by the Tribunal to determine the appropriate method of calculation, which, as demonstrated above, is plainly contradictory. [emphasis added]\n\n15.\n\nThe First Tribunal\u2019s \"method of calculating the damages\" mentioned in the second sentence here above can only refer to the valuation of the damages caused by the denial of justice and the violation of fair and equitable treatment by reference to the amounts accorded pursuant to Decision No. 43 for unlawful expropriations. The First Committee made it explicit that this method was not *per se* problematic.\n\n16.\n\nThe First Committee did not thereby positively validate the method used by the First Tribunal, which was not within the powers of the First Committee to do. However, the First Committee made it explicit that it did not invalidate that method either. It sanctioned the contradiction between two elements without rendering judgment on the intrinsic validity of any of these elements.\n\n17.\n\nIt follows that the First Annulment Decision did not accord *res iudicata* effect to paragraph 688 of the First Award.\n\n**The Committee\u2019s Decision Remains Unaffected**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nHowever, the above does not affect the Committee\u2019s decision to reject the Application for Annulment. There are two reasons for this.\n\n19.\n\nFirst, paragraph 4 of the First Annulment Decision\u2019s *dispositif* is also to the effect that \"the body of the Award but for Section VIII\" is *res judicata.* As the Decision correctly notes, this confers *res judicata* effect to paragraphs 611 and 612 of the First Award, where the First Tribunal considered that it could have regard to facts preceding the entry into force of the BIT as an element of context in deciding on the violation of the BIT by acts postdating its entry into force. This statement was different from that contained in paragraph 688 of the First Award. Yet, the Resubmission Tribunal appears to have *inferred* from paragraphs 611 and 612 that the contents of paragraph 688 was also *res judicata.* It presented as \"its interpretation of the *res judicata* portions of the First Award\" *inter alia* that the arguments related to expropriation may not be taken into consideration except insofar as they constitute factual background,5 and that the \"consequence of this interpretation of the First Award\" was that the assessment of damage based on the expropriation should be rejected as \"inconsistent with the First Award\".6 For the reasons explained above, I regard this reasoning as incompatible with the First Annulment Decision. In addition, when it comes to interpreting the First Award\u2019s subsisting portions rather than the First Annulment Decision, I do not agree that the contents of paragraph 688 can be endowed with *res judicata* effect on the basis of an inference from paragraphs 611 and 612, which contain general statements that are not part of the First Award\u2019s *dispositif* nor a necessary underpinning of a relevant part of the *dispositif* (a *\"motif decisoire\"*)*.* However, this does not turn the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s decision into a *manifest* excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Its deficiencies notwithstanding, the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasoning finds a partial basis in the First Annulment Decision\u2019s unreserved finding that \"the body of the Award but for Section VIII\" is *res judicata.* As a consequence, the excess of powers is not obvious, and therefore not manifest.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 228.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 230 (d).\n\n20.\n\nSecond, as stated in the Decision by reference to the case law and the writings of Professor Schreuer, annulment should be \"contingent not only upon the presence of one of the defects listed in Article 52(1) but also upon its material impact on one or both parties\".7\n\nDecision, para. 210, quoting from Christoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention \u2014 A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, para. 485.\n\n21.\n\nThis is of direct relevance to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s decision that \"any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award\".8\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 228 and 230(d).\n\n22.\n\nThe Applicants\u2019 valuation of the damage caused by the denial of justice and the violation of fair and equitable treatment as it was argued before the Resubmission Tribunal is based on an alleged loss of opportunity.9 The Applicants\u2019 position is that absent the denial of justice, which consists of the undue delay in the domestic proceedings initiated by Mr. Pey Casado, the Applicants would have been in possession of a Chilean court judgment (the judgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago of 24 July 2008) before the First Award was rendered. They could thus have argued on the basis of that judgment that the expropriation suffered by Mr. Pey Casado was null and void *ab initio* pursuant to Chilean law, with the consequence that it was a continuing fact falling within the temporal scope of application of the BIT.10\n\nBefore the Resubmission Tribunal, the Applicants did not seek to establish their damage by reference to the amounts paid pursuant to Decision No. 43, as the First Tribunal had done. See Decision, paras. 630, 631.\n\nSee Decision at paras. 216, 255, 265, 708, and further at para. 645 regarding the Applicants\u2019 position that there could be no loss of opportunity to obtain reparation in the Chilean domestic legal system since the BIT\u2019S fork-in-the-road provision had caused them to waive their right to domestic reparation in order to expand their arbitration claim.\n\n23.\n\nHowever, as also stated in the Decision,11 this argument has no factual basis. The Chilean court judgment did not consecrate the nullity *ab initio* of the expropriation. Quite the opposite, it rejected Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s claim on the basis that it was time-barred. This implies that the expropriation was qualified as an instantaneous act, not as a continuing act. It follows that even if the Applicants had obtained the judgment in due time for it to be filed as evidence before the First Tribunal, it would have been of no avail. To the opposite, it would have confirmed the First Tribunal\u2019s eventual decision that the expropriation fell outside the temporal scope of application of the BIT.\n\nDecision, paras. 180 and 219.\n\n24.\n\nIn more general terms, it bears emphasis that since the opportunity allegedly lost by the Applicants was in fact inexistent, no annulment of the Resubmission Award could have paved the way to the allocation of damages."}], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Additional Request | Applicants\u2019 additional request in defense of the integrity and the fairness of the proceeding dated 27 April 2019 |\n| ICSID Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceeding in force as of 10 April 2006 |\n| Applicants or Claimants | Mr. Victor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende |\n| Annulment Application | Applicants\u2019 application for annulment of the award rendered on 13 September 2016 |\n| Annulment Proceeding | Second annulment proceeding registered on 25 October 2017 |\n| Articles on State Responsibility | Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, annex to United Nations General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001. |\n| BIT or Treaty | Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Chile for the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments signed on 2 October 1991 and entered into force on 29 March 1994 |\n| C-[#] | Claimants\u2019 exhibits in the Annulment Proceeding |\n| CL-[#] | Claimants\u2019 legal authorities in the Annulment Proceeding |\n| Committee | *Ad hoc* Committee constituted on 20 December 2017 in the Annulment Proceeding |\n| Counter-Memorial on Annulment | Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment dated 20 July 2018 |\n| Decision No. 43 | Decision of the Santiago court dated 28 April 2000 |\n| RA-[#] | Respondent\u2019s exhibit in the Annulment Proceeding |\n| FET, FET-standard | Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 4 BIT) |\n| First Annulment Decision | Decision rendered by the First Committee on 18 December 2012 |\n| First Annulment Proceeding | Annulment proceeding registered on 6 July 2009 |\n| First Arbitration | Arbitration proceeding submitted on 7 November 1997 and registered on 20 April 1998 |\n| First Award | Award rendered by the First Tribunal on 8 May 2008 |\n| First Committee | *Ad hoc* Committee composed of Professor Piero Bernardini, Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri and Mr. L.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment (the **\"Annulment Application\")** of the award rendered on 13 September 2016, as rectified by the decision of 6 October 2017 (the **\"Resubmission Award\")** in the arbitration proceeding (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2) between V\u00edctor Pey Casado and the Foundation President Allende (together the **\"Applicants\"** or the **\"Claimants\")** and the Republic of Chile **(\"Chile\"** or the **\"Respondent,\"** and together with the Applicants, the **\"Parties\").** The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n2.\n\nThe Resubmission Award was rendered by a tribunal composed of Sir Franklin Berman (President), Mr. Alexis Mourre and Mr. V.V. Veeder (the **\"Resubmission Tribunal\").**\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute in the original proceeding (the **\"First Arbitration\")** was submitted by the Claimants to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** on 7 November 1997 on the basis of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Chile for the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments entered into force on 29 March 1994 (the **\"BIT\"** or the **\"Treaty\")** and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 18 March 1965 (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute arose from the confiscation of the assets of two Chilean companies *(Consorcio Publicitario y Period\u00edstico S.A.* **\"CPPSA\"** and *Empressa Period\u00edstica Clar\u00edn Ltda* **\"EPC Ltda\")** following the *coup d\u2019\u00e9tat* led by General Augusto Pinochet in 1973. In the arbitration, the Claimants alleged *inter alia* that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated their investments in CCPSA and EPC Ltda and failed to accord them fair and equitable treatment. In particular, the Claimants claimed that Chile discriminated against them and denied them justice in connection with the request that Mr. Pey Casado filed with the Chilean courts in 1995 seeking reparation for the confiscation of a Goss printing press (the **\"Goss press case\").1**\n\nResubmission Award, para. 11.\n\n5.\n\nIn an award dated 8 May 2008 (the **\"First Award\"),** the tribunal composed of Professor Pierre Lalive, Mr. Mohammed Chemloul and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard (the **\"First Tribunal\")** dismissed the Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim finding that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* (the Chilean newspaper published by CCPSA and EPC Ltda) was not covered *ratione temporis* by the BIT. The First Tribunal also found that the Respondent had breached Article 4 of the BIT due to its courts\u2019 failure to render a decision in the Goss press case for seven years (denial of justice) and due to its ministerial decision to award compensation to persons other than Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation (the **\"Decision No. 43\")** (discrimination). After dismissing all other claims, the First Tribunal awarded the Claimants USD 10,132,690.18 (plus compound interest) in damages, USD 2,000,000 in legal fees and costs, and USD 1,045,579.35 in procedural costs.2\n\nFirst Award, Section X\n\n6.\n\nOn 6 July 2009, the ICSID Secretary-General registered Chile\u2019s application for annulment of the First Award (the **\"First Annulment Proceeding\").** On 18 December 2012, the *ad hoc* committee composed of Professor Piero Bernardini, Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri and Mr. L. Yves Fortier, (the **\"First Committee\")** issued a decision partially annulling the First Award (the **\"First Annulment Decision\").** Specifically, the First Committee annulled paragraph 4 of the *dispositif* of the First Award and the corresponding paragraphs in the reasoning.3\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 359.\n\n7.\n\nOn 18 June 2013, the Claimants filed a new request for arbitration pursuant to Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention (the **\"Resubmission Proceeding\").** In the Resubmission Proceeding, the Claimants argued *inter alia* that the daughter of Mr. Pey Casado (Ms. Coral Pey Grebe) was the proper party to the Resubmission Proceeding (being the assignee of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s shares in CPPSA and EPC Ltda),4 and sought damages in the amount of USD 150 million for the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT, plus costs.\n\nThe first page of the request for arbitration refers to the case as \"Victor Pey Casado and Spanish Foundation President Allende (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2) v. Republic of Chile.\" However, at page 3 of the request, the Claimants are identified as being Ms. Coral Pey Grebe and the Foundation President Allende.\n\n8.\n\nThe Resubmission Award was rendered on 13 September 2016. The Resubmission Tribunal ruled that Ms. Coral Pey Grebe could not be a claimant in her own right in the Resubmission Proceeding. By the same award, it further found that the Claimants failed to prove any quantifiable injury due to a breach of Article 4 of the BIT (and thus no financial compensation could be awarded on this account) and dismissed the Claimants\u2019 claims for unjust enrichment and moral damages. The Claimants were ordered to bear three quarters of the arbitration costs.5\n\nResubmission Award, para. 256.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants applied for the rectification of four errors in the award of 13 September 2016 pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention. During the rectification proceeding, the Claimants unsuccessfully requested that two of the members of the Resubmission Tribunal (Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. V.V. Veeder) be disqualified. In a decision rendered on 6 October 2017 (the **\"Rectification Decision\"),** the Resubmission Tribunal rectified paragraphs 61, 66, 198, and paragraph 2 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award and ordered that the Claimants bear the costs of the rectification proceeding.6\n\nRectification Decision, para. 62.\n\n10.\n\nIn this annulment proceeding, the Applicants are seeking the annulment of the Resubmission Award on the following grounds: (i) improper constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention); (ii) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); (iii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); and (iv) failure to state the reasons on which the award is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).7\n\nOn 20 February 2019, the Applicants confirmed that they are not seeking the annulment of the Resubmission Award on the ground of Article 52.1(c) of the ICSID Convention, and that the reference to this provision in paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Reply on Annulment of 9 November 2018 was erroneous.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 10 October 2017, the Applicants filed the Annulment Application with ICSID pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"****).8** The Annulment Application contained a request for the stay of the enforcement of the Resubmission Award pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, and Arbitration Rule 54(2) (the **\"Stay Request\").**\n\nThe Annulment Application lists as Applicants in the Annulment Proceeding Mr. Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation President Allende.\n\n12.\n\nOn 25 October 2017, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Annulment Application and notified the Parties that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n13.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the *ad hoc* Committee (the **\"Committee\")** was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.

All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n14.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties were informed that the Annulment Proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date, and that Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. The Parties were later informed that Ms. Laura Bergamini, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Mr. Garel as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n15.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the Applicants submitted a request for the production of certain documents, along with exhibits C-208 through C-212.\n\n16.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties regarding arrangements for the first session and circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the conduct of the proceeding.

Following a challenge by the Respondent, Professor Sands informed the Centre by letter of 10 January 2014 that, while rejecting the grounds for the challenge, he took the view that the proper course was to allow the proceedings to continue without distraction, and accordingly relinquished his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n126.\n\nOn 13 January 2014, following the resignation of Professor Sands, the ICSID Secretary-General notified the vacancy to the Parties and the proceeding was suspended pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(2). On the same date, the Tribunal consented to the resignation of Professor Sands pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), and on 31 January 2014, Mr. V. V.

By letter of the same day, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID invited the Parties to submit to the Tribunal their proposals regarding the procedure, conduct and timetable of the rectification proceedings (the **\"Rectification Proceedings\").**\n\n144.\n\nBy letter dated 10 November 2016, the Claimants submitted a request for suspension of the Rectification Proceedings, pending disclosure of certain information by Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder.\n\n145.\n\nBy letter dated 16 November 2016, the Resubmission Tribunal invited the Respondent to indicate, by 30 November 2016, whether it consented to the requested rectifications.\n\n146.\n\nBy letter dated 17 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Resubmission Tribunal to order the Claimants to submit a Spanish version of the Request for Rectification, and requested a period of at least three weeks following receipt of the Spanish version of the Request for Rectification to consider and submit to the Resubmission Tribunal its position on the proposed rectifications.\n\n147.\n\nBy letter dated 18 November 2016, the Claimants reiterated their requests for disclosure dated 27 October 2016 and 10 November 2016 to the Resubmission Tribunal.\n\n148.\n\nBy letter dated 21 November 2016, the Resubmission Tribunal took note of the references in the Request for Rectification to further declarations touching the independence and impartiality of Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder, and communicated to the Parties the fact that the two arbitrators had already responded to the Secretary-General of ICSID on these questions, and had nothing further to add.\n\n149.\n\nBy a second letter dated 21 November 2016, the Resubmission Tribunal rejected the request filed by the Claimants for the suspension of the Rectification Proceedings. In the same letter, the Resubmission Tribunal requested the Claimants to provide a Spanish translation of the Request by 2 December 2016, and set the procedural timetable for the Rectification Proceedings.\n\n150.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2016, the Claimants proposed the disqualification of Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder (the **\"Challenged Arbitrators\")** under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the **\"First Disqualification Proposal\").**\n\n151.\n\nBy letter dated 29 November 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were suspended until the First Disqualification Proposal had been decided.\n\n152.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Centre transmitted to the Parties, the Decision of the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to dismiss the First Disqualification Proposal. By letter of the same date, the Resubmission Tribunal notified the Parties that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were resumed on that date.\n\n153.\n\nOn 23 February and 4 March 2017, the Claimants submitted further proposals for the disqualification of Mr. Veeder and subsequently for the disqualification of Sir Franklin Berman under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. By letter of 23 February 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal notified the Parties that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were once again suspended.\n\n154.\n\nBy letter dated 6 March 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that it was treating the Claimants\u2019 further proposals for disqualification as a proposal to disqualify a majority of the Resubmission Tribunal, to be decided simultaneously by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention (the **\"Second Disqualification Proposal\").**\n\n155.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, the Centre informed the Parties of the Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council to dismiss the Second Disqualification Proposal. By letter of the same day, the Resubmission Tribunal notified the Parties that the Rectification Proceedings had resumed with immediate effect.\n\n156.\n\nBy letter dated 18 April 2017, the Tribunal notified the Parties that the procedural arrangements as set out in the letter dated 21 November 2016 would stand, subject to a prolongation of the procedural timetable by twenty weeks to take account of the suspensions of the Rectification Proceedings as set out above.\n\n157.\n\nBy letter dated 21 April 2017, the Claimants communicated a request to the Tribunal for the discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44.\n\n158.\n\nIn an Order dated 24 April 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal set 1 May 2017 as the date for the Respondent to state its position under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 with respect to the Claimants\u2019 request for discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings.\n\n159.\n\nOn 6 October 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal rendered the Rectification Decision.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 positions before the Resubmission Tribunal and its Decisions**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 position before the Resubmission Tribunal is set out in detail in paragraphs 42 to 122 of the Award of 13 September 2016, and in paragraphs 37, 38, 40, 42 and 44 of the Rectification Decision of 6 October 2017.\n\n161.\n\nIn essence, the Claimants submitted that Ms. Coral Pey Grebe was the proper party of the Resubmission Proceeding (being the assignee of all of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s rights) and claimed that the Resubmission Tribunal had jurisdiction over her under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.21 On the merits, the Claimants argued that the purpose of the Resubmission Proceeding was only to establish the amount of damages due to them because of the denial of justice and discrimination they suffered (which had been determined by the First Tribunal)22 and elaborated on the calculation and quantification of those damages.23 As relief, the Claimants an award of EUR 11,156,739.44 and USD 517,533 as well as legal costs.24\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 43-48.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 49-52.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 53-119.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 120-122.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position before the Resubmission Tribunal is described in paragraphs 123 to 270 of the Resubmission Award, and paragraphs 39, 41, 43 and 45 of the Rectification Decision of 6 October 2017.\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent essentially argued that Ms. Coral Pey Grebe was not a proper party to the Resubmission Proceeding (because Article 52 of the ICSID Convention provides that only the parties of the original arbitration and annulment may resubmit the dispute to the new tribunal) and that, in any case, the Resubmission Tribunal lacked jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *personae* over her.25 On the merits, the Respondent contested the calculations and quantifications of damages presented by the Claimants and their expert, argued that the Claimants had failed to satisfy their burden of proving damages, and objected to the admissibility of a number of the Claimants\u2019 claims.26 Accordingly, the Respondent sought the dismissal of the Claimants\u2019 claims and an award for costs and fees.27\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 123-130.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 131-167.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 168-170.\n\n164.\n\nIn the Resubmission Proceeding, the Parties lengthily discussed the scope of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s mandate in light of the possible *res judicata* effect of unannulled parts of the First Award.\n\n165.\n\nIn the Resubmission Award, the Resubmission Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n(1) That Ms Coral Pey Grebe cannot be regarded as a claimant in her own right in these resubmission proceedings;\n\n(2) That, as has already been indicated by the First Tribunal, its formal recognition of the Claimants\u2019 rights and its finding that they were the victims of a denial of justice constitutes in itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the Respondent\u2019s breach of Article 4 of the BIT;\n\n(3) That the Claimants, bearing the relevant burden of proof, have failed to prove any further quantifiable injury to themselves caused by the breach of Article 4 as found by the First Tribunal in its Award;\n\n(4) That the Tribunal cannot therefore make any award to the Claimants of financial compensation on this account;\n\n(5) That the Claimants\u2019 subsidiary claim on the basis of unjust enrichment is without legal foundation;\n\n(6) That there are no grounds in the circumstances of the case for the award of moral damages either to Mr Pey Casado or to the Foundation;\n\n(7) That the arbitration costs of these resubmission proceedings are to be shared in the proportion of three quarters to be borne by the Claimants and one quarter by the Respondent, with the result that the Claimants shall reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$159,509.43;\n\n(8) That all other claims are dismissed.28\n\nResubmission Award, para. 256 (footnotes omitted).\n\n166.\n\nIn the Rectification Decision of 6 October 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal decided that:\n\n(a) Paragraphs 61, 66, and 198, and paragraph 2 of the *dispositif,* of the Resubmission Award are rectified as set out in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, and 55 above.\n\n(b) The costs incurred by the Centre in respect of these Rectification Proceedings, including the costs resulting from the associated challenges to Sir Franklin Berman and Mr Veeder, shall be borne by the Claimants and the Claimants shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$ 22,963.36, in addition to the amount specified in paragraph 255 of the Resubmission Award. The Tribunal makes no further order as to costs.29\n\nDecision on Rectification, para. 62.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 REQUESTS FOR RELIEF IN THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDING**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicants\u2019 request for relief**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nIn their Memorial and Reply on Annulment, the Applicants request that the Committee:\n\n1. Accept this [brief], and its documents attached, seeking the annulment\n\ni. of the whole resubmission Award notified on 13 September 2016, on the grounds of Article 52(1) of the Convention, including points (a), (b), (d) and (e) thereof, [and]\n\nii. the annulment of \u00a7\u00a758, 61 and 62(b) of the Decision of 6 October 2017, on the grounds of points (b), (d) et (e) of Article 52(1) of the Convention;\n\n2. Order the Republic of Chile in due course to bear the costs of this annulment proceeding and of incidental issues - such as the one that arose on 12, 15 et 16 February 2018 - along with the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* Committee, the charges for use of ICSID facilities, the translation expenses and the professional fees and expenses of [the Applicants], lawyers, experts and/or any other persons called upon to appear before the *ad hoc* Committee, and pay the relevant amounts for any other infringements established as the *ad hoc* Committee may deem fair and equitable, with compound interest.\n\n3. Adopt any other measures that the members of the Committee consider fair and equitable in the circumstances of this case.30\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 759 (courtesy translation provided by the Applicants); Reply on Annulment. Section 13 (footnotes omitted); Annulment Application, para. 288; Applicants' Submission on Costs, pp. 11 and 12 (clarifying that the Applicants also seek the annulment of paragraph 7 (on costs) of the Resubmission Award). For the sake of completeness, the Committee considers that the Applicants\u2019 request for the annulment of the entire Resubmission Award extends to the requests for annulment of specific paragraphs of the award mentioned in their briefs.\n\n168.\n\nIn the Additional Request, the Applicants request:\n\n[I]n order to preserve the integrity and the fairness of the procedure, and given the nature and the seriousness of the behaviour of the Respondent State on 12,15 and 16 February 2018, its blatant bad faith, the non-rectification of its behaviour by its representatives, but the complete contrary, its deliberate amplification, that the *ad hoc* Committee exercises its powers and that, in compliance with Rule 26 of the IBA Guidelines on party representation:\n\n(a) That it draws appropriate conclusions in its reasonable appreciation of the judicial evidence produced, as to the evaluation of the fact that, against this evidence, on 12, 15 and 16 February 2018 Chile presented the reference made by the Claimants in their submissions as deception, and to this end, explicitly pejorative, the injunction of 24 July 2017 of the 28th Civil Court of Santiago as being vacated since October 2017;\n\n(b) That it draws appropriate negative inferences from the attempts by Chile's representatives, with consumed effrontery, to make the *ad hoc* Committee believe, with no foundation and against all of the evidence, that the Claimants\u2019 representatives lacked professional ethics by bluntly questioning the inaccuracy of the communication of 12 February 2018 submitted by the Defendant, and that such supposed failures are abundant and proven, since the start of the arbitration, without any evidence;\n\n(c) That it sanctions the behaviour of the Republic of Chile for its communications of 12 and 15 February and at the hearing the following day by introducing and continuously supporting inaccurate facts, infringing upon the honour and the professional integrity of the Claimants, to the point of getting the *ad hoc* Committee to warn that it was ready, after deliberation, to also take measures against them by virtue of Article 44 of the Convention, and to encourage a Claimant\u2019s counsel to rectify, at the request of Chile, an entirely founded declaration produced in a circle of public debate;\n\n(d) Warning to which the Claimants affirm, with a clear conscience, to have never exposed itself today or in the past, exclusive of the double deception in favour of which the Defendant State designated its own qualities before the *ad hoc* Committee on 12, 15 and 16 February, which characterise more than twenty years of the present arbitration [...];\n\n(e) That it takes into account these facts in the allocation of costs of the arbitration, by indicating if needed how and to what extent they have led the Committee to a different allocation of these costs;\n\n(f) That it takes all other appropriate measures to preserve the fairness and integrity of the procedure.31\n\nAdditional Request, para. 21 (courtesy translation provided by the Applicants).\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s request for relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial and the Rejoinder on Annulment, the Respondent requests that the Committee:\n\na. [R]eject Claimants\u2019 annulment request, in its entirety;\n\nb. [O]rder Claimants to cover the costs of the Annulment Proceeding in their entirety; and\n\nc. [O]rder Claimants to reimburse Chile for the full amount of its legal fees and expenses (with interest thereon, at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2% per annum, starting from the date of the Committee\u2019s decision and until the date of payment).32\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 142. In the Counter-Memorial on Annulment, the Respondent also requested interest on the cost of the proceedings (namely, under let. b. it sought \"that the Committee order Claimants to cover the costs of the present annulment proceeding, in their entirety (with interest thereon, at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2% per annum, starting from the date of the Committee\u2019s decision and until the date of payment)\").\n\n**V. RULING CONCERNING THE ADDITIONAL REQUEST**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nBesides their requests for annulment of the Resubmission Award, the Applicants made an application on 27 April 2018, reiterated in their *R\u00e9plique* of 9 November 2018,33 asking the *ad hoc* Committee to preserve the integrity and the equity of the proceeding by sanctioning the Respondent for alleged bad faith and fraudulent behaviour in the conduct of the case. The Applicants allege that they discovered a *\"modus operandi.\"* by which the Respondent presents inexact and untrue facts \"en *vue de frustrer l\u2019arbitrage\"* in general, and in particular to induce the Committee, first, to believe that the Applicants acted against rules of professional ethics, and, second, to draw the wrong conclusions with respect to the outcome of the case.34\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 506-518.\n\nAdditional Request, pp. 7, 18, 19; Reply on Annulment, para. 506.\n\n171.\n\nThe Applicants allege that the Respondent employed this *modus operandi* systematically but refer explicitly to its allegedly false assertion that the courts of Chile \"vacated\" the Applicants\u2019 request for document production, where in reality, the request was still before the Chilean courts. This alleged false information was to mislead the Committee before its own decision on the Applicants\u2019 document production request relating to the business relations between Chile and the Essex Court Chambers.35\n\nAdditional Request, pp. 9 ss.; Reply on Annulment, paras. 510 ss.\n\n172.\n\nThe Applicants request that the Committee formally recognise that the Respondent\u2019s submission was fraudulent, that it draw negative inferences from this, that it state the Applicants\u2019 conduct was professionally correct, that it take the incident into consideration when making its decision on costs, and that it take all appropriate measures to guarantee the integrity and equity of the proceeding.36\n\nAdditional Request, paras. 20-21.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the accusations and insists that its presentation was correct and that \"[i]t is [the Applicants] themselves who misled the Committee, by asserting - falsely - that Chile was in violation of a court-ordered obligation to produce documents to [the Applicants].\"37\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 415.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that this is not the only incident where the Applicants \"accuse us of lying when they have been misrepresenting this issue for ten years.\" The Respondent refers to a judgment of a Chilean court,38 which - according to the Applicants - has stated *ex officio* the nullity of the Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975 (the **\"Decree No. 165\"),39** where in reality the court has given effect to the Decree.40\n\nReferenced under Exhibit C-282.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 697.\n\nTr. Day 2 (13 March 2019), pp. 566-568; Tr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), pp. 788-789.\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \"we never said that the proceeding was vacated. We said the particular court order was vacated.\"41\n\nTr. First Session (16 February 2018), p. 135.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that at the time of the evidentiary hearing the case was still pending before the Chilean courts and that therefore it is still under no obligation in Chile to produce documents.42\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 418(d).\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Committee to direct the Applicants to \"cease and desist from their accusations\" and \"to take this whole deplorable episode into account at the time of awarding costs and legal fees.\"43\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 419.\n\n178.\n\nThe Committee has carefully studied the Parties\u2019 submissions regarding the Chilean proceedings and in particular the Respondent\u2019s Second Submission on Preliminary Issues, dated 12 February 2018, which is at the centre of the dispute at hand. The submission states that while the Claimants appear to argue that the Committee\u2019s intervention is \"necessary to give effect to a Chilean court order,\" \"the court order in question was vacated on procedural grounds [...] and the Chilean courts currently are reviewing Claimants\u2019 assertion.\"44 The text makes it clear, and the context further confirms, that the Respondent only stated that the specific order had been vacated and not the whole proceedings.\n\nChile\u2019s Second Submission on Preliminary Issues, 12 February 2018, para. 13.\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee does not find this statement to be misleading. In any event, it has not been misled and understood that the \"vacation\" of one court order has not terminated the proceeding before the Chilean courts with respect to document production.\n\n180.\n\nAs to the other controversial example quoted by both Parties, *i.e.* the judgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, the Committee has found that the judge discussed the issue of absolute nullity of the Decree No. 165 and a possible imprescriptibility of claims for confiscation in the conditional. The judge came to the conclusion, after detailed reasoning, that Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s claim for restitution of the Goss printing machine was time barred after 20 years. She confirmed thereby that Decree No. 165 had not been without effect under Chilean law.45\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008 under \"quinzi\u00e8mement\" and \"seizi\u00e8mement\" (C-282).\n\n181.\n\nThe careful analysis of the judgment leads to the conclusion that the Applicants\u2019 reference to it is not correct. At the same time, the Committee was not misled because the Applicants had exhibited the judgment and allowed for the proper appreciation.\n\n182.\n\nBoth Parties have presented their cases with vigour, passion and sometimes unevidenced speculation on the state of mind and motivation of the other Party. The Committee has no reason to consider that the Parties did not believe in the truth of these speculations. Be that as it may, the Committee does not participate in the speculations and draws no inferences from them. It can state with certainty that they have not influenced its decision, nor have they led it to assume that either Party acted unprofessionally or in bad faith. Further, both Parties have contributed to a normal and constructive procedure.\n\n183.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee finds that the integrity of the proceeding has been safeguarded and rejects the Parties\u2019 requests for reliefs in connection with the Applicants\u2019 Additional Request.\n\n**VI. LEGAL STANDARDS**\n-----------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe First Committee devoted a comprehensive chapter on the legal standards of the three grounds for annulment that had been asserted by the Respondent, *i.e.* a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to state the reasons on which the award was based.46\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, paras. 63-87.\n\n185.\n\nBoth Parties made the First Committee\u2019s determination their own and refer to it repeatedly and affirmatively.47 They have refrained from presenting repetitive textbook explanations and off-the-shelf documentation and have condensed their presentations to a number of basic, widely accepted and uncontroversial principles in order to establish the legal framework of this Annulment Proceeding, even with regard to the fourth ground of annulment, which was not asserted during the First Annulment Proceeding, *i.e.* the improper constitution of the tribunal.\n\nCf. for instance: Reply on Annulment, paras. 62, 111; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 147-150.\n\n186.\n\nThe Committee sympathises with the Parties\u2019 approach, all the more so because it subscribes to the First Committee\u2019s analysis, which the Respondent summarises as follows:\n\nWith respect to \"[t]he ground for annulment for manifest excess of powers,\" the First Committee stated that \"this ground is meant to ensure, *inter alia,* that tribunals do not exceed their jurisdiction or fail to apply the law agreed upon by the parties.\" To justify annulment, \"[a] tribunal (1) must do something in excess of its powers and (2) that excess must be \u2018manifest.\u2019 It is a dual requirement.\" The phrase \"excess of powers\" would include an \"inappropriate [] exercis[e] of jurisdiction (or failure to exercise jurisdiction); and [a] fail[ure] to apply the proper law.\" Nevertheless, \"there is an important distinction between a failure to apply the proper law[,] which is a ground for annulment, and an incorrect or erroneous application of that law, which is not a ground for annulment.\" For its part, the term \"manifest\" means \"sufficiently clear and serious.\" If the tribunal\u2019s conclusions \u2018\"seem tenable and not arbitrary, they do not constitute [a] manifest excess of powers\u2019\"\n\nRegarding the second ground for annulment \u2014 \"that there has been a serious departure from [a] fundamental rule[] of procedure\" - the First Committee \"agree[d] with Chile that this ground involves a three-part test: (i) the procedural rule must be fundamental; (ii) the Tribunal must have departed from it; and (iii) the departure must have been serious.\" The ***first*** part of the test requires identification of \"procedural rules that are essential to the integrity of the arbitral process and must be observed by all ICSID tribunals. The parties agree that such rules include the right to be heard, the fair and equitable treatment of the parties, proper allocation of the burden of proof and absence of bias.\" The ***second*** part *(i.e.,* the \"departure\" prong) \"requires that the Committee examine the full record, including the Transcripts and the Award [,] to determine whether or not the Tribunal violated the rule in question.\" The ***third*** part of the test \u2014 the \"seriousness\" prong \u2014 requires \"that the applicant must demonstrate \u2018the impact that the issue may have had on the award.'\" The committee must \"enquire whether, if the rule had been observed, there is a distinct possibility (a \u2018chance\u2019) that it may have made a difference on a critical issue.\"\n\nThe First Committee also stated that, in addition to the above three prongs, there is a fourth, waiver-related issue to consider: \"Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 27 and 53, a party may lose its right to object on the ground of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure if it has failed to raise its objection to the tribunal\u2019s procedure upon becoming aware of it, or \u2018promptly\u2019 as mentioned in Rule 27.\"\n\nWith respect to the issue of \"failure to state reasons,\" the First Committee endorsed the statement of the *Vivendi I* committee to the effect that \"\u2018Article 52(1)(e) [of the Convention] concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.\u2019\" So long as \"\u2018the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).\u2019\" Further, \"\u2018reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\u2019\" At bottom, the \"[First] Committee believe[d] that as long as there is no express rationale for the conclusions with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative point, an annulment must follow, whether the lack of rationale is due to a complete absence of reasons or the result of frivolous or contradictory explanations.\"48\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s summary also represents its position.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 147-150 (footnotes omitted; brackets in original; emphases in original).\n\n187.\n\nThe Parties not only agree with the analysis of the First Committee, they also agree that annulment proceedings are not to be equated to an appeal, which is obvious given the clear wording of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.49\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 26-28; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 267-272; *see also* First Annulment Decision, paras. 87-88.\n\n188.\n\nBeyond these fundamental principles, the Parties have discussed the following nuances.\n\n189.\n\nWith respect to the (im-)proper constitution of the tribunal (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention), the Applicants50 subscribe to the *ICSID Secretariat's Background Paper on Annulment,* explaining that the ground:\n\n[I]s intended to cover situations such as a departure from the parties\u2019 agreement on the method of constituting the Tribunal or an arbitrator\u2019s failure to meet the nationality or other requirements for becoming a member of the Tribunal51\n\nas well as to Professor Schreuer who states that:\n\n[Q]uestions concerning the tribunal's proper constitution might arise from dissatisfaction in the manner in which challenges to arbitrators and alleged conflicts of interest have been handled. [...] Appointment of an arbitrator who manifestly does not possess these qualities [as required by Art. 14(1) Convention] may be put forward as a ground for annulment.52\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 31-35.\n\nICSID Secretariat. *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* 5 May 2016, para. 77.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer. *The ICSID Convention A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, para. 122 (RALA-0006).\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent does not disagree with these quotes but warns that Article 52(1)(a) is concerned with the constitution and not the composition of the tribunal.53\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, paras. 38-40.\n\n191.\n\nThe Committee shares the quoted opinions. The distinction between constitution and composition has to be determined under the concrete circumstances of the case.\n\n192.\n\nWith respect to a manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention), the Applicants54 expand on the First Committee\u2019s analysis by quoting decisions of previous *ad hoc* committees such as *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela,* which found that Article 52(1)(b) \"covers the case where a tribunal exercises a judicial power which on a proper analysis had not been conferred on it (or vice versa declines to exercise a jurisdiction which it did possess).\"55 The Applicants further assert that for an excess of powers to be manifest, it must be both \"obvious\" and \"serious.\"56\n\nAnnulation Application, para. 254; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 38-57.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V, et al v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27 (\"*Venezuela Holdings v.

Indonesia (II),* where the committee found that:\n\n\"If the original award had only been annulled in part, the new Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled.\" If a new Tribunal reconsiders an issue not annulled, it exceeds its power.58\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

However, they assert that in cases of egregious error - as observed in *Lahoud v. Congo - \"une telle mauvaise application \u2018est d\u2019une telle nature ou ampleur qu\u2019elle \u00e9quivaut objectivement* [...] \u00e0 *une non-application\u2019.\"60*\n\n*Antoine Abou Lahoud and Leila Bounafeh-Abou Lahoud v.

For an excess of power to be \"manifest,\" it must be perceived by the Committee without a complex analysis. Accordingly, the Applicants\u2019 alleged \"contortions\" *ipso facto* signal the absence of a \"manifest\" excess of power.62 When a tribunal\u2019s conclusions seem tenable and not arbitrary, they do not constitute an excess of powers.63\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 147.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 10.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 147.\n\n198.\n\nThe Committee agrees that an *\"inapplication la plus absolue\"* of the law which is to be applied in the circumstances of the case fulfils the requirement of an excess of power.64 The Committee also agrees that an excess of powers that, in the words of *Soufraki v. UAE,65* is \"textually obvious and substantively serious\" is \"manifest,\"66 whereas conversely, the alleged excess which is difficult to perceive even with some degree of analysis, or which has no substantively serious effect, does not qualify as \"manifest.\"\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 47-48.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v*. *United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7 *(\"Soufraki v.

It is not authorised to qualify the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning as deficient, superficial or wrong, and inconsistencies between different parts of the Resubmission Award do not amount to a lack of reasons, unless the contradiction is of a kind that two arguments neutralise each other or \"cancel each other out.\"77\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v.

Montenegro,* where the committee held that the discretion:\n\n[I]s by no means unlimited and must take account of all relevant circumstances, including the gravity of the circumstances which constitute the ground for annulment and whether they had - or could have had - a material effect upon the outcome of the case, as well as the importance of the finality of the award and the overall question of fairness to both Parties.80\n\n*CEAC Holdings Limited v. Montenegro,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/08, Decision on Annulment, 1 May 2018, para. 84 (RALA-0052).\n\n209.\n\nHowever, the Respondent insists that the circumstances of the present case warrant upholding the Resubmission Award. It underlines that the Applicants brought the case in bad faith, never met their burden of proof for damages, rejected Chile\u2019s efforts to compensate for the injuries suffered during the military dictatorship, and have manoeuvred to keep the dispute alive for more than 20 years.81\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, paras. 123-130; Tr. Day 2(13 March 2019), pp. 308-313.\n\n210.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the position of the *CEAC* committee, which is itself in line with well-established case law,82 that committees should not automatically declare an award annulled if one of the grounds for annulment is present but that they should exercise their authority in weighing, in particular, the gravity of the circumstances which constitute the ground for annulment and whether they had - or could have had - a material effect upon the outcome of the case. As stated by Professor Schreuer, annulment should be \"contingent not only upon the presence of one of the defects listed in Article 52(1) but also upon its material impact on one or both parties.\"83 This implies that the sheer duration of the proceeding cannot be taken as a criterion, in particular when both parties share the responsibility for the delays, nor the relative success of one or the other party in the previous stages.\n\nFor an overview of the evolution of the case law cf. Christoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention-A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, paras. 466-485 (RALA-0006).\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *op. cit.,* para. 485 (RALA-0006).\n\n211.\n\nThe Committee will proceed in keeping these considerations in mind.\n\n**VII. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Initial considerations**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) The Background of the Dispute and Reasons of the Resubmission Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nAfter the break-down of the military dictatorship and the re-establishment of democracy in Chile, Mr. Pey Casado, a Spanish citizen, returned to Chile, his second home country, from which he had been expelled by force at the beginning of the dictatorship. He sought redress for the injury and injustice inflicted upon him by turning to the Chilean government, Chilean courts, and international arbitration. These multiples *d\u00e9marches,* as understandable and legitimate as they may be, are evidently not synchronised. This has necessarily contributed to the complexity of the case.\n\n213.\n\nIn this section, the Committee will set out the background and basic issues of the disputes as it sees it. They relate to the specificity and complexity of the case, which crosscut the structure of the requests for annulment and the defences against them, and which have been present throughout the proceeding. Where appropriate, it will first make rulings on the requests for annulment.\n\n214.\n\nDuring their closing statement at the Hearing on Annulment, on 14 March 2019, the Applicants explained the reasons for their perseverance in the dispute by insisting that it is the legal and moral duty of any person injured to fight for their subjective rights and to defend them and thereby objective justice against all odds, and that, by doing so, they \"defend the collective interests of the international law, of law in general.\"84\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), pp. 601, 828-830.\n\n215.\n\nThey contend that the military *coup d'\u00e9tat l* ed by Augusto Pinochet in 1973 and the ensuing dictatorship, which ended in 1989 with the restoration of democracy, have unlawfully deprived them of their investments and use of property and caused hardship and injury to them. Personal belongings as well as business assets and shares in companies were first physically seized in 1973 *manu militari* and then by a sham administrative act, the Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975. These unlawful and anti-constitutional acts were not capable of terminating Mr. Pey\u2019s legal title to ownership.85\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 237; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 293 ss., 681.\n\n216.\n\nThroughout  the different stages of the proceedings, Decree No. 165 has been a central piece, *\"un enjeu principal\"*86 of the Applicants\u2019 arguments. They assert that it had a factual, but never a legal existence since it contradicted fundamental principles of the Chilean Constitutions of all times, that, therefore, it was null and void from the beginning and could not have any legal effect, and that it has not extinguished their ownership rights. These assertions were made before the First Tribunal,87 before the First Committee,88 before the Resubmission Tribunal,89 and before the present Committee.90\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 136.\n\n*See* First Award, paras. 73 ss., 207, 447, 588 ss.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 348.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 56 ss., 141 ss., 196 ss.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 262 ss.; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 681 ss.; Reply on Annulment, paras. 116, 135 s. and passim; Tr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), pp. 28 ss. and 49 ss.\n\n217.\n\nThe Applicants insist that as injustice has been done and its effects are still present, they have a moral and legal duty to themselves and to society to fight until justice is rendered and the injury is compensated.91\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), pp. 601, 828-830.\n\n218.\n\nThis deep conviction and indignation have led them to try every potential venue of remedies to reach the same goal: before national courts in Chile and before international arbitration tribunals, relying on both national and international laws.\n\n219.\n\nAs an interim result, Mr. Pey Casado has been compensated for the loss of his personal belongings.92 Chilean courts rejected the claim for restitution of the Goss printing machine for being time-barred when it was brought in 1995, *i.e.* 20 years after Decree No. 165.93 The 1st instance court did not deny the existence and effect of Decree No. 165. Rather, Mr. Pey argued before the court that the decree was *\"entach\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 de droit public, imprescriptible [et] incurable, qui provoque son inexistence juridique.\"94* This was disputed by the State which asserted that the decree had been enacted in accordance with constitutional provisions applicable at the time, with the consequence that Mr. Pey\u2019s request was time-barred.95 The Court dismissed Mr. Pey\u2019s argument, reasoning that his claim was time-barred by calculating the relevant periods of time as from the enactment of Decree No. 165.96 As to compensation for the confiscated shares in the Chilean companies and especially *El Clar\u00edn,* the Claimants initiated the present proceeding and informed the Chilean authorities by letter of 24 June 199997 that they had opted for this alternative as a \"fork in the road\" decision and would not pursue their claim under the Chilean compensation Law No. 19,568, dated 23 July 1998.98\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 46.\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008 (C-282).\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008, pp. 2 and 8 (C-282) (brackets in original).\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008, pp. 4 and 5 (C-282).\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008, pp. 9 and 10 (C-282).\n\nLetter from J.

Malheureusement, cette politique ne s\u2019est pas \u00e9t\u00e9 traduite dans les faits.100*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 667-669 (footnotes omitted).\n\n222.\n\nAccording to the First Award, the Respondent has declared that:\n\n[L]es *gouvernements d\u00e9mocratiques qui remplac\u00e8rent en 1990, au moyen d\u2019\u00e9lection libres, le gouvernement de Pinochet, se sont primordialement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s de r\u00e9parer les dommages caus\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime instaur\u00e9 au Chili par le coup d\u2019\u00e9tat du 11 septembre 1973. En effet, le**Gouvernement a pris les mesures pour r\u00e9parer les dommages caus\u00e9s aux victimes dans tous les secteurs.101*\n\nFirst Award, para. 668.\n\n223.\n\nThese declarations of the most diverse actors all recognise that injustice has been done and injuries were inflicted. At the same time, the Resubmission Tribunal dismissed the Applicants\u2019 request for compensation. The Applicants deduced from these seemingly contradictory findings that the Resubmission Tribunal was driven by a \"systematic bias\"102 in the conduct of the proceeding, in its reasoning and finally, in its decision to the detriment of the Applicants.\n\nTr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), p. 151.\n\n224.\n\nThey assert that this was only possible by systematically disregarding the binding force, the *res iudicata* effect of the non-annulled parts of the First Award,103 and by speculating, allowing the Tribunal\u2019s position to be *\"dict\u00e9e par une \u00e9coute du Tribunal\"* accommodating Chile\u2019s wishes.104 The reproach is recurrent and repeated in paragraphs 55-63, 105-106 of the Reply on Annulment, in paragraphs 277, 305, 321, 335-349, 359, 397 ss., 431 ss., 468 s., 507-549, 550 ss., 558 ss., 598, 614, and 647 of the Memorial on Annulment, and in paragraphs 7, 8, 84, 174, 176-185, 200, 207 ss., 221-226, 238, 239, 250, 255 of the Annulment Application. On pages 156-181 of the Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants quote paragraphs 176, 178, 187, 195, 198, 199, 203, 211, 215, 216, 223, 232, 236, 238, 243, 244, and 286 of the Resubmission Award as examples of systematic bias amounting to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and manifest excess of power.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 3-5.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 3.\n\n225.\n\nThe Applicants summarise their complaint as follows:\n\n*En outre, la partialit\u00e9 du Tribunal de Resoumission est manifeste en ce qu\u2019il laisse entendre que le Comit\u00e9* ad hoc *charg\u00e9 de l\u2019annulation n\u2019est pas all\u00e9 assez loin dans son acceptation de la demande d\u2019annulation formul\u00e9e par le Chili \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Sentence initiale. En attaquant des aspects essentiels de la Sentence initiale o\u00f9 le Comit\u00e9 ad hoc n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord avec le Chili sur ce qu\u2019il y aurait eu une erreur susceptible d\u2019entrainer l\u2019annulation, mais a tranch\u00e9 en faveur des Demanderesses, le Tribunal de Resoumission s\u2019est \u00e9cart\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de proc\u00e9dure, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019absence de biais.105*\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 243, 182 ss.; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 697 ss.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that injustice had been done during the military *coup d\u2019\u00e9tat* and the dictatorship.106 To the contrary, it contends that it deployed great efforts to compensate the people that *\"had been mistreated by the Military Government.\"107*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 8 and paras. 38-40 in relation to the seizure of *El Clar\u00edn.*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 42.\n\n227.\n\nThe Respondent summarises its position by confirming that:\n\nChile is ***not*** attempting to justify the expropriation, and is still conscious of the injury that the expropriation caused. As will be seen, however, this issue is entirely inapposite for the Committee\u2019s purposes.108\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 89 (emphasis in original).\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the reason for the Applicants\u2019 failure to receive compensation for the expropriation of *El Clarin* is twofold. On the one hand, they \"voluntarily, consciously, and formally renounced their right to obtain reparations under Chilean law\" by letter of 24 June 1999, by which they informed the Government that they made use of the \"fork-in-the-road\" option and pursued their claim through international arbitration.109 On the other hand, the First Tribunal correctly \"concluded that the expropriation exceeded the temporal scope of the BIT\u2019S substantive protections,\"110 that the expropriation was completed in 1975, before the entry into force of the BIT, and that compensation for expropriation could not be awarded under international law.111\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 63.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 89.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 100 ss.\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent speculates about the Applicants\u2019 motivation to pursue the dispute so vigorously:\n\nNow, these particular Claimants are not motivated by rational economic considerations. They are motivated, obviously, by the prospect of a big payoff, but they also see inherent value in keeping this case alive, because by keeping this case alive, they keep their ideological cause in the public eye.\n\nThis case continues to be very high profile in Chile. And so the longer this case goes on, the more of these hearings we have, the more it stays in the public eye; and, therefore, this case, in itself, just the actual act of continuing the case, has inherent value to them.112\n\nTr. Day 2 (13 March 2019), p. 569.\n\n230.\n\nTo the Committee\u2019s mind, two interrelated aspects are crucial for the Applicants\u2019 refusal to accept a result that admits injustice and still denies monetary compensation, and for their conviction that the result must be tainted by systematic bias and partiality. One concerns the parallel but unsynchronised proceedings before national courts and international arbitral tribunals as well as the application or non-application of national law and international law. The other concerns the element of time, which is relevant under three headings: first, the temporal application of the BIT, second, the statute of limitations, and third, the length of Chilean court proceedings, amounting to - in the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* finding - a denial of justice and violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation.\n\n231.\n\nThe Committee will deal with these aspects before addressing the different claims and requests for annulment one by one. It does so because their proper appreciation has repercussions for several of these claims, in particular for the allegation of a continuous manifest excess of power and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as operated through a systematic bias on the part of the Resubmission Tribunal.\n\n**(2) The First Award and its partial confirmation by the First Committee**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nArticle 10.2 of the BIT tries to prevent parallel proceedings by providing:\n\nIf the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the time it was initiated by one of the Parties, it shall be submitted, at the discretion of the investor, to:\n\n- The national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute; or\n\n- International arbitration in the conditions described in paragraph 3.\n\nOnce the investor has submitted the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other procedure shall be final.\n\n233.\n\nThe First Tribunal found, with *res judicata* effect that:\n\n*La requ\u00eate d\u2019arbitrage et la demande introduite devant le juge chilien ont donc un objet et un fondement distincts. La premi\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 demander r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant des actes de saisie et de confiscation relatifs aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda sur le fondement de certaines dispositions de l\u2019API Chili-Espagne, tandis que la seconde vise la restitution d\u2019un bien meuble bien identifi\u00e9, la rotative Goss, et express\u00e9ment exclu du champ du consentement \u00e0 l'arbitrage, en se fondant sur le droit chilien.113*\n\nFirst Award, para. 491.\n\n234.\n\nIn the end, the Applicants were not successful with their claim before national courts for the restitution of the Goss printing machine, abandoned this effort for a remedy and submitted their claim to the First Tribunal by complementing their initial request.114\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 125-127.\n\n235.\n\nMr. Pey brought his claim before the Chilean courts on the basis of Chilean law, and the Chilean courts applied Chilean law.115\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008 (C-282).\n\n236.\n\nThings are more complicated with respect to the law to be applied by arbitral tribunals. Article 10.4 of the BIT provides:\n\nThe arbitration body shall take its decision on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement, of the law of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, including the rules relative to conflicts of laws, and of the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to investment, as well as of the principles of international law on the subject.\n\n237.\n\nThe Parties hold contradictory views on the proper law to be applied to the issues of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s ownership of the shares in the Chilean juridical persons, of his nationality, and of his and the Foundation\u2019s investments, and of the expropriation.\n\n238.\n\nThe present *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s authority is limited to a review of the Resubmission Award. However, the Resubmission Award can only be assessed properly by setting it in the perspective of the First Award and the First Annulment Decision, which upheld important parts of it.\n\n239.\n\nThe First Tribunal did not apply the provisions of the BIT and national Chilean law cumulatively, incongruously and at random but rather differentiated its application in accordance with specific subject matters and spheres of application.\n\n240.\n\nAfter a meticulous analysis of Chilean law in paragraphs 179-229 of the First Award, the First Tribunal established that Mr. Pey Casado had acquired shares of the Chilean companies CPP S.A. and EPC Ltda, incorporated under Chilean law, and that this acquisition was perfected before the expropriation was completed by Decree No. 165. It further established, in paragraphs 230-235 of the First Award, that the acquisition was a legal investment under Chilean law and thereby satisfied the criteria of an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Finally, it established that Mr. Pey Casado transferred part of the legally acquired shares to the Foundation President Allende in accordance with *\"le droit applicable a la cession (quel qu 'il soit - espagnol, chilien ou autre)\"* but in any event not international law.116\n\nFirst Award, para. 528.\n\n241.\n\nFor the First Tribunal, these findings are of crucial importance and it reiterates them in strategic contexts as follows in its Award:\n\n*Le Tribunal conclut que, au moment o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e la saisie du journal El Clarn, M. Pey Casado devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le seul propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9gitime les actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 CPP S.A.* (paragraph 229)\n\n*Au vu de l'ensemble des d\u00e9veloppements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il n'existait pas, dans le droit chilien en vigueur en 1972, de d\u00e9finition \u00e9tablie de l\u2019investissement \u00e9tranger et que l'op\u00e9ration r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par M. Pey Casado s'est conform\u00e9e au droit chilien qui lui \u00e9tait applicable. En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l'investissement de M. Pey Casado, l'achat d'actions d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chilienne du secteur de la presse au moyen de paiements en devises \u00e9trang\u00e8res effectu\u00e9s sur des comptes bancaires en Europe, satisfait les conditions pos\u00e9es par l'API et plus particuli\u00e8rement par ses articles 1(2) et 2(2).* (paragraph 411)\n\n*Sur la seconde question, celle de savoir si les investissements des demanderesses ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative s'impose de l'avis du Tribunal arbitral, compte tenu des conclusions auxquelles il est parvenu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment aux termes de son appr\u00e9ciation des preuves et de son analyse juridique. En bref, il s'agit de la conclusion selon laquelle M. Pey Casado a bien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des investissements et \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire de biens meubles ou immeubles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9s par l'autorit\u00e9 militaire chilienne.*\n\n*On rappellera \u00e0 ce propos l'existence d'un jugement chilien reconnaissant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Pey Casado sur les actions confisqu\u00e9es ainsi que le fait que les autorit\u00e9s chiliennes, ex\u00e9cutives et administratives (comme judiciaires) \u00e9taient inform\u00e9es des revendications et demandes formul\u00e9es par les demanderesses.*\n\n*Quant \u00e0 l'invalidit\u00e9 des confiscations et au devoir d'indemnisation, il y a lieu de rappeler aussi des d\u00e9clarations parfaitement claires de la d\u00e9fenderesse dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.* (paragraphs 665-667)\n\n242.\n\nThe First Committee confirmed the First Tribunal\u2019s findings. It stated that the \"Tribunal provided ample and indeed very detailed reasons to support its conclusions\" and \"that the Tribunal applied the \u2018proper law,\u2019 *i.e*., Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT as well as the Chilean law to which these provisions refer.\"117\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, paras. 148-156.\n\n243.\n\nAfter having established the Claimants\u2019 ownership and investment, the First Tribunal went on to assess Chile\u2019s conduct after the *coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.* It describes the seizure of Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s assets by the Chilean military forces in 1973 and the adoption of a series of laws, decrees and other normative acts, amongst which are Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975 and Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000. It describes the conduct and the regulatory texts as *\"faits pertinents,\"118* and it subsumes these facts under the provisions of the BIT and international law.\n\nFirst Award, paras. 585, 588-597.\n\n244.\n\nThe First Tribunal considered the validity of Decree No. 165 pursuant to Chilean law for the specific purpose of determining whether the expropriation was a continuous or an instantaneous act. The Applicants argued that since the Decree was *inexistent* under Chilean law, they suffered a *de facto* expropriation which was continuous in nature, which still continued after the entry into force of the BIT and therefore fell within its temporal scope of application. The First Tribunal rejected this specific thesis of the inexistence (or nullity *ab initio)* of the Decree on the basis of an analysis of Chilean law:\n\n*Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve qu\u2019un certain nombre de ces d\u00e9crets a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 par les juridictions internes chiliennes. [...] A la connaissance du Tribunal, le d\u00e9cret supr\u00eame n\u00b0165 est toujours en vigueur.*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*A la connaissance du Tribunal, la validit\u00e9 du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0165 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en cause par les juridictions internes et ce d\u00e9cret fait toujours partie de l'ordre juridique interne chilien.119*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 593, 603. 608. 622.\n\n245.\n\nAs a consequence thereof, the First Tribunal was not interested in qualifying Chile\u2019s acts as wrongful and unlawful, because in any event, the expropriation was completed in 1975 and could therefore not qualify as a violation of Article 5 of the BIT, which defines, as elements of a lawful expropriation, that they \"must be adopted exclusively for reasons of public utility or national interest pursuant to constitutional and legal provisions, and shall in no case be discriminatory.\" The Tribunal held that \"[l]*es biens des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une expropriation d\u00e9finitive en 1975\"* executed by the cumulative acts of the seizure by the military in 1973 and the adoption of Decree No. 165120, that *\"l\u2019expropriation dont se plaignent les demanderesses doit \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019acte instantan\u00e9, ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la date d\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019API,\"* that in 1975, with the adoption of Decree No. 165 *\"l\u2019expropriation \u00e9tait consomm\u00e9e, **quelle que soit l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation que l\u2019on peut porter sur sa lic\u00e9it\u00e9,\"121*** and that it is *\"impossible d\u2019exproprier deux fois de suite les m\u00eames biens.\"122*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 622, 608.\n\nFirst Award, para. 608 (emphasis added).\n\nFirst Award, para. 622.\n\n246.\n\nThe First Tribunal\u2019s determination in this matter implicitly followed the Articles on State Responsibility, which the First Tribunal mentioned in other respects.123 Article 14 of the Articles on State Responsibility provides that \"[t]he breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character occurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.\" In a Commentary, the International Law Commission argues that \"[e]xceptionally, a tribunal may be justified in refusing to recognize a law or decree at all, with the consequence that the resulting denial of status, ownership or possession may give rise to a continuing wrongful act.\" The norm and commentary were discussed during the Hearing.124 Without referring to Article 14 or the Commentary but in line with its contents, the First Tribunal discussed whether an exceptional situation existed in the dispute before it. It confirmed that it did not agree that a *\"violation continue\"* existed under the circumstances of the case and dismissed exceptional circumstances.125\n\nFirst Award, fn. 585.\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), pp. 790 ss.; James Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* Cambridge University Press 2002 (RL-034).\n\nFirst Award, paras. 605-606.\n\n247.\n\nThe First Tribunal left no doubt about the *\"invalidit\u00e9 des confiscations et au devoir d'indemnisation\"* and urged Chile to follow up to its own respective recognition of these facts.126 At the same time, it reiterated:\n\n*Quoi qu\u2019il en soit de la pertinence et de la valeur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en droit interne chilien, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ne peuvent pr\u00e9valoir sur les consid\u00e9rations qui ont conduit le Tribunal arbitral aux conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, en application des dispositions de l'API.127*\n\nFirst Award, para. 667.\n\nFirst Award, para. 669.\n\n248.\n\nAll of this is in line with the distinction between different issues where domestic law and international law each has its own sphere of application, as described by Professor Zachary Douglas:\n\nAny dispute concerning the existence or extent of the rights in rem alleged to constitute an investment that arises in an investment treaty arbitration must be decided in accordance with the municipal law of the host state for this is not a dispute about evidence (facts) but a dispute about legal entitlements. When the issue becomes the international validity of certain acts of the host state which have prejudiced the investor\u2019s legal entitlements under municipal law, then international law applies exclusively.128\n\nZachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims,* Cambridge University Press 2009, para. 115 (RL-035).\n\n249.\n\nThe First Committee confirmed the finality of the Tribunal\u2019s assessment.129 It rejected the Claimants\u2019 request to re-open the debate on the effect of the Chilean Constitution as time-barred.130\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 159.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, paras. 346-348.\n\n250.\n\nIn conclusion, the First Tribunal, the First Committee, the Applicants and the Respondent agreed that Mr. Pey Casado was expropriated in violation of Chilean law. Notwithstanding this consensus, compensation for this illegal seizure has not been granted, as a result of the combined effects of (i) the rejection of a claim for illegal expropriation under international law by the First Tribunal because it fell outside the temporal scope of the BIT; (ii) the rejection of the claim for the restitution of the Goss machine by a Chilean court because it was time-barred; and (iii) Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s decision to bring the claims before an ICSID tribunal thus excluding national remedies in accordance with the \"fork-in-the road\" provision of Article 10.2 of the BIT.\n\n251.\n\nThis result is a consequence of the interplay and application of national and international law as well as of the passage of time. With respect to international law, the First Tribunal\u2019s finding was confirmed by the First Committee as final and is thus *res iudicata.* The First Committee confirmed the finality of the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Applicants had no entitlement to compensation for the illicit expropriation under international law *ratione temporis.*\n\n252.\n\nNeither the Resubmission Tribunal nor the present *ad hoc* Committee has the authority to reverse the consequence, although the Committee understands that the Applicants perceive this as an ongoing and unacceptable injustice perpetrated by a military dictatorship.\n\n253.\n\nThe First Tribunal also found that Chile had breached its obligation to treat the Claimants\u2019 investment fairly and equitably, as provided in Article 4.1 BIT. The first such violation consisted in the adoption of Decision No. 43, dated 28 April 2000, *i.e.* after the entry into force of the BIT, *\"accordant des compensations pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l'avis du Tribunal arbitral, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s.\"131*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 622, 674.\n\n254.\n\nThe second violation consisted in the delay of more than seven years (1995-2002) for proceedings before the Chilean first instance court on the Claimants\u2019 request for the restitution of the Goss machine. After these seven years, the Applicants abandoned the Chilean court proceedings and submitted the dispute over the Goss machine to the First Tribunal, in complementing their original request. The Tribunal determined that the answer to the \"relatively simple question\" of whether the period of seven years constituted a denial of justice:\n\n[N]*e peut \u00eatre que positive, au regard des faits \u00e9tablis et d\u00e9j\u00e0 retenus par le Tribunal arbitral, l\u2019absence de toute d\u00e9cision par les tribunaux civils chiliens sur les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Pey Casado s\u2019analysant en un d\u00e9ni de justice. En effet, l\u2019absence de d\u00e9cision en premi\u00e8re instance sur le fond des demandes des parties demanderesses pendant sept ann\u00e9es, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire entre septembre 1995 et le 4 novembre 2002 (moment de l\u2019introduction de la demande compl\u00e9mentaire dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure) doit \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 comme un d\u00e9ni de justice de la part des tribunaux chiliens. En fait, des d\u00e9lais proc\u00e9duraux importants constituent bien une des formes classiques de d\u00e9ni de justice.132*\n\nFirst Award, para. 659. The First Tribunal relies - among others - on *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Daviatian & Ellen Baca* v. *The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award. 1 November 1999 (CL-300 in the original proceeding), and Jan Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law,* Cambridge University Press 2005.\n\n255.\n\nThe Applicants interpreted the First Tribunal\u2019s finding on a denial of justice as opening the way to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s granting compensation based on the injury caused by the expropriation. The issue has caused considerable debate. It is therefore appropriate to quote the Applicants\u2019 position in some detail. They insist that they *\"ne fondent leur pr\u00e9tention sur une remise en cause du raisonnement du Tribunal arbitral initial ou des parties de la Sentence qui ont autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e.\"133* At the same time they invite the Resubmission Tribunal to take the alleged deliberate retention into account:\n\n[D]*ans la d\u00e9termination du pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9ni de justice, qui doit remettre les parties dans la situation dans laquelle elles auraient d\u00fb se trouver si le d\u00e9ni de justice n\u2019avait pas eu lieu. Rappelons en effet, qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de d\u00e9ni de justice, le Tribunal arbitral initial n\u2019aurait pas pu conclure dans la Sentence que \u00ab \u00e0 la connaissance du Tribunal, la validit\u00e9 du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 165 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en cause par les juridictions internes et ce d\u00e9cret fait toujours partie de l\u2019ordre juridique interne chilien.134*\n\nAnd:\n\n*Le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal arbitral devra d\u00e8s lors constater que l\u2019un des actes de d\u00e9ni de justice commis par la R\u00e9publique du Chili \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Pey et de la Fondation a eu pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher les Demanderesses d\u2019informer le Tribunal arbitral du jugement de la juridiction civile chilienne reconnaissant la \"nullit\u00e9 de droit public\" du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0165, et, en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019absence de titre de l\u2019Etat d\u00e9fendeur sur l\u2019investissement en 1995, compte tenu de la nullit\u00e9 de droit public du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 165. Ce qui a conduit le Tribunal arbitral \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que, \"\u00e0 sa connaissance\", ce D\u00e9cret n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en cause par les juridictions internes et faisait toujours partie de l\u2019ordre juridique interne chilien, et, par voie de cons\u00e9quence, que les dispositions de l\u2019article 5 de l\u2019API \u00e9taient inapplicables aux faits de confiscation.*\n\n*Cette tromperie fondamentale d\u00e9masqu\u00e9e, la D\u00e9fenderesse ne saurait bien \u00e9videmment pas se pr\u00e9valoir de ses man\u0153uvres proc\u00e9durales subs\u00e9quentes.135*\n\nResubmission Memorial of 27 June 2014, para. 294 (C-8).\n\nResubmission Memorial of 27 June 2014, para. 277 (C-8).\n\nResubmission Memorial of 27 June 2014, para. 286-287 (C-8) (footnotes omitted; emphasis omitted).\n\n256.\n\nThe present *ad hoc* Committee does not share the Applicants\u2019 analysis in this respect.\n\n257.\n\nIn fact, the First Tribunal took care to dissociate the issue of expropriation from the two events that in its opinion amounted to a violation of Article 4.1 BIT. The dissociation was crucial for the temporal applicability of the BIT with respect to the violations of fair and equitable treatment. In that perspective, the First Tribunal determined that Decision No. 43 granting compensation for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* to individuals who were not its owners, was not an expropriatory act, since the expropriation was once and for all completed. Rather, Decision No. 43 should *\"s\u2019analyser davantage en une application discriminatoire d\u2019une loi post\u00e9rieure au trait\u00e9 et des droits que celle-ci a cr\u00e9\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question distincte et non pas d\u2019un fait identique \u00e0 l'expropriation*\"136 The Tribunal found that Mr. Pey Casado had become the owner of the shares and an investor. The discrimination was not caused by Decree No. 165 nor any other act of seizure but by the fact that Chile had decided to compensate *\"de[s] personnes non-propri\u00e9taires\"* to the detriment and injury of the real owner.137 It has found that this discriminatory conduct had to be considered as an unfair and unequitable treatment.138\n\nFirst Award, para. 622.\n\nFirst Award, paras. 629 ss.\n\nFirst Award, paras. 671 ss.\n\n258.\n\nAs to the long delay of the procedure before the Chilean courts, the First Tribunal found that this delay amounted to a denial of justice and unfair and unequitable treatment, without any reference to the subject matter, *i.e.* the seizure of the Goss machine.\n\n259.\n\nThe issue of the constitutionality and nullity of Decree No. 165 was irrelevant for the adjudication by the First Tribunal of the violation of Chile\u2019s obligation to guarantee fair and equitable treatment.\n\n260.\n\nThe First Committee confirmed the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard and insisted that the First Tribunal had correctly determined that both the execution of Decision No. 43 and the denial of justice \"were completely separate and distinct from the 1975 expropriation.\"139 The First Committee explicitly stated that \"the duty to provide redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end, as long as the relevant treaty obligation was in force for the State concerned at the time of the alleged breach.\"140 The First Committee thus dismissed Chile\u2019s assertion that subsequent to the expropriation, there was no investment left to which the fair and equitable treatment standard could apply. At the same time, these reasons made it clear that the finding of a breach of fair and equitable treatment was not dependent on the qualification of the expropriation as a continuous fact.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 159.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 168 (footnotes omitted).\n\n261.\n\nThe First Committee confirmed the finality of the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that Chile owes compensation for the violation of its obligation to guarantee fair and equitable treatment, insofar as it occurred after the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n262.\n\nThe First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect also prevented the Resubmission Tribunal from taking into account the Applicants\u2019 argument that absent the denial of justice, the First Tribunal could have taken account of the judgment of the Santiago court to the alleged effect that Decree No. 165 was null *ab initio* so that the expropriation was a continuous fact. Having found that the expropriation was not within the temporal scope of application of the BIT, the First Tribunal reasoned that as a logical consequence thereof, arguments and evidence concerning the expropriation could not be used to establish a prejudice resulting from the denial of fair and equitable treatment. This statement was made in Chapter VIII, paragraph 688 of the First Award. As further discussed in paragraphs 620 ss. below, the First Committee quoted this paragraph affirmatively and confirmed in paragraph 283 of its Decision that \"the Tribunal expressly stated that an evaluation of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the expropriation was irrelevant and that all the allegations, discussion and evidence related to such damages could not be considered by the Tribunal.\" The First Committee thereby made the content of paragraph 688 of the First Award its own, with the consequence that it was *res iudicata* for the Resubmission Tribunal.\n\n**(3) The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s general appreciation of the** ***res iudicata*** **effect**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal defined its role as being limited to determining \"the nature of the compensation due for the breach or breaches already established by the First Tribunal\" and insisted:\n\n[T]hat the present Tribunal is absolved from any need to investigate afresh whether there was any breach of Chile\u2019s obligations towards the Claimants in respect of the present dispute, what that breach consisted in, or whether the breach gives rise to a right to compensation. All of those matters have been predetermined by the First Award and are binding on all Parties under Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention. Not only is there no need for the Tribunal to go into these matters, but it would be a manifest excess of its own jurisdiction if the Tribunal purported to do so. That is the express consequence of Arbitration Rule 55(3).141\n\nResubmission Award, para. 178.\n\n264.\n\nIt held, however, that the duty to refrain from re-determining the non-annulled portions of the First Award did not:\n\n[P]revent the present Tribunal from proceeding to an interpretation of the First Award for the purposes of carrying out its mandate under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise; the essence of the Tribunal\u2019s mandate consists in giving effect, in the light of the arguments marshalled by the Parties, to certain paragraphs in the dispositif of the First Award, and this the Tribunal can hardly do without first understanding what those paragraphs mean.142\n\nResubmission Award, para. 207.\n\n265.\n\nIn that perspective, the Resubmission Tribunal recalls that the First Tribunal had rejected claims linked to the expropriation in 1973-1975 because the temporal scope of the BIT did not cover that period and that only the breach of the Respondent\u2019s obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, including not to deny justice, which was linked to Chile\u2019s Decision No. 43 of the year 2000 to compensate non-owners instead of Mr. Pey Casado and to the long delay of Chilean court proceedings starting in 1995, was a valid basis for compensation. The Resubmission Tribunal reasons that the Claimants try to circumvent this \"insuperable obstacle\" by a \"complex\" answer which it describes as follows:\n\nIn certain places, the Claimants contend that elements of the non-annulled parts of the First Award need to be revisited and modified by the present Tribunal. That would however (as already indicated) be well beyond the Tribunal\u2019s functions and powers under ICSID Arbitration Rule 55 and will not be further considered in this Award. The main substance of the Claimants\u2019 answer is, however, different. It consists essentially in the contention that the central consequence of the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press, was that they (the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely null *(ex tunc)* and as such incapable of producing any legal effects. Had they been in a position to do so, the argument continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able to recover their confiscated property in Chile, or at the least would have been able to establish before the First Tribunal that the expropriation of this property was not an instantaneous act taking final effect in 1975, but was not in fact completed until many years later, and the result of that would have been that the expropriation did indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal under the BIT, contrary to the findings in the First Award.143\n\nResubmission Award, para. 196.\n\n266.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal continues its reasoning through \"a brief excursus on the status of Decree No. 165 under Chilean public law\" and justifies this excursus as \"convenient\" since the issue has \"absorbed an appreciable portion of the argument between the Parties, both in the written phase and at the oral hearing.\" It weighs the Respondent\u2019s expert\u2019s reasoning and finds merit in the opinion that the nullity *ab initio* of a normative act should be pronounced explicitly and that the Claimants\u2019 assertions are more \"of the speculative than of the operational.\"144\n\nResubmission Award, para. 197.\n\n267.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal then considers that it \"sees no need to go further into the matter as it has concluded that, even if the Claimants were able to establish the proposition for which they have been arguing, it would have no material bearing on these resubmission proceedings.\"145 This is due to the possible consequences with respect to remedies which might result from the status of Decree No. 165:\n\nAs the Tribunal sees it, there are only two: one is that the First Tribunal was wrong in its finding that the expropriation was excluded *ratione temporis* from the scope of the BIT; the other is that what amounted in effect (if not in form) to the expropriation took place with Decision No. 43. Each of these has figured, in various forms, in the submissions of the Claimants in the course of these resubmission proceedings. Both of them, however, encounter insuperable difficulties. As to the first, the Tribunal is in no doubt that the First Tribunal, although it used slightly different forms of words in different parts of its Award, was of the view that the expropriation was completed *(fait consomme)* with the physical seizure in 1975 and thus fell outside the scope of the BIT. More to the point, however, the present Tribunal is simply not empowered to hear an appeal against that finding, or to substitute a view of its own for that of the First Tribunal, or to award any relief of any kind whatsoever on that account. As to the second (i.e. that the effective expropriation did not take place until Decision No. 43), it is also in its turn incompatible with the First Tribunal\u2019s findings as to the chronology of the expropriation, but it is equally incompatible with Decision No. 43 itself, the whole tenor of which is that it was an award of compensation in respect of a confiscation *that had already occurred.* The Tribunal\u2019s final observation before leaving the subject, is that, if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decree No. 165 did indeed have decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment continued to be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation - the remedy for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal in these resubmission proceedings.146\n\nResubmission Award, para. 198.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 198 (emphasis omitted; emphasis in original).\n\n268.\n\nIn other words, the Resubmission Tribunal reasoned that a finding that Decree No. 165 was null *ex tunc* would serve no useful purpose in the Resubmission Proceeding, since the Resubmission Tribunal was bound by the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* finding that the expropriation was an instantaneous act occurring at the time of that decree.\n\n269.\n\nIn addition, the Resubmission Tribunal found that it was also bound by the *res iudicata* finding in the First Award that the compensation for the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard could not be based on the value of the expropriated assets. Paragraph 230(d) of the Resubmission Award thus provides that \"any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.\"147 This is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 661-672 below.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 228 is to the same effect.\n\n**(4) The Parties\u2019 positions before this Committee**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe anti-constitutionality, the illegality and the absolute nullity *ex tunc* of Decree No. 165 remain central elements in the Applicants\u2019 claim, *\"la question la plus essentielle des \u00e9changes dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure en resoumission.\"*148 They assert that this has been definitely established by the Chilean courts and is *res iudicata* between the Parties. As a consequence, the Applicants have never lost their status as legal owners and the confiscation in 1973 and 1975 was restricted to a purely physical seizure, to a *de facto* but not to a *de iure* confiscation:149\n\n*Comme il ressort des \u00a7\u00a7665-674 de la Sentence initiale, de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un Tribunal de Justice de Santiago du 29 mai 1995, des articles de la Constitution du Chili d\u2019application directe et imp\u00e9rative tels qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s par la Cour Supr\u00eame, les Demanderesses continuent aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 \u00eatre les propri\u00e9taires l\u00e9gaux de tous les biens et droits du Groupe Clarin.*150\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 79.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 237, 259; Tr.

(\"The Status of Decree No. 165\") of the Resubmission Award, and in particular its paragraph 198, crystallises the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s erroneous and annullable reasoning by denying the injustice perpetrated by the military dictatorship and by preventing a just compensation for the illegal confiscation of the Claimants\u2019 investments, caused by unfair treatment and denial of justice. Since paragraph 198 *\"constitue le point d'ancrage des paragraphes suivants de la* 57?,\"159 the Applicants request that the Committee not only to annul paragraph 198 but also *\"les paragraphes de la SR 216, 219, 220, 221, 224, 227-229, 23-236, 244, qui d\u00e9coulent, directement ou indirectement, des \u2018conclusions\u2019 \u00e9tablies au \u00a7 198 [...] ainsi que, en consequence, les points 2-7 du Dispositif dont ils constituent le fondement et l'ensemble de la SR\"160*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 82.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 84; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 681-696.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Applicants\u2019 arguments and request. It asserts that the First Tribunal determined, with *res iudicata* effect, that the expropriation was completed in 1975, *i.e.* before the entry into force of the BIT and that \"none of the BIT\u2019s substantive provisions applied to the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn.\"161* The Respondent summarises that:\n\n[T]he Resubmission Tribunal concluded that the Chilean law issues under discussion were irrelevant simply because what [sic] Claimants\u2019 theory about the implications of Chilean law necessarily contradicted the conclusions in the First Award. The Resubmission Tribunal therefore could not have accepted such arguments without doing violence to the First Award, which had clearly held that \"the expropriation [of El Clar\u00edn] was completed (fait consomm\u00e9) with the physical seizure in 1975 [sic] and thus fell outside the scope of the BIT.\" Given that conclusion, Claimants\u2019 theories about Decree No. 165 were irrelevant, since the issue of whether or not the expropriation was a continuing one or not - for purposes of the BIT and of international law - did not depend on the legal status of Decree No. 165 under Chilean law. [...] Accordingly, there was no need for the Resubmission Tribunal to take any decision or make any pronouncement on the Chilean law issues that had been raised by Claimants. The tribunal\u2019s handling of the applicable law issues was therefore unimpeachable.162\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 399.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 406 (footnotes omitted).\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the *\"Claimants\u2019 arguments did not persuade the Resubmission Tribunal\"* and that it is inadmissible to substitute the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s determination by another one, which would necessarily amount to an appeal.163\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 108.\n\n**(5) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Committee will address the asserted grounds for annulment in the subsequent sections of this Decision. In the context of these initial considerations, it will analyse the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and findings with a view to determining whether it was systematically biased in favour of Chile as alleged by the Applicants. Two indicators in that sense would be a denaturalization of the Applicants\u2019 submissions and a disrespect of the First Tribunal\u2019s adjudication in order to accommodate Chile\u2019s interests, thereby disregarding the injustice perpetrated by the military dictatorship through the violent seizure of the Applicants\u2019 investments and the ensuing adoption of an illegal, anti-constitutional and absolutely invalid sham normative act, Decree No. 165, again as alleged by the Applicants.\n\n278.\n\nIn that perspective, the Committee has juxtaposed and compared the arguments and findings of the First Tribunal as far as they were confirmed as final by the First Committee, the Resubmission Tribunal, and the Parties in relation to the qualification and relevance of Decree No. 165. After a careful analysis, it has found that the Resubmission Tribunal has not denaturalized the Applicants\u2019 submissions and has not reconsidered the non-annulled portions of the First Award. As a consequence, it cannot confirm that the Resubmission Tribunal acted in a partial and biased manner and favoured Chile by an inappropriate reasoning with respect to this issue. The Committee will document this determination in the following paragraphs.\n\n279.\n\nParagraph 198 of the Resubmission Award, which the Applicants present as the \"anchor\" of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the qualification of the confiscation, starts by stating that the qualification of Decree No. 165 has no \"material bearing\" on the proceeding. In this light, it is unclear why the Resubmission Tribunal has embarked on a long discussion on that qualification in the preceding paragraph 197. Perhaps it wanted to pay tribute to the fact that the Parties, and in particular the Applicants, had taken the issue very seriously, that it had been a dominant feature during the initial phase, the first annulment phase and the resubmission phase of the proceeding, and that the First Tribunal had not treated the matter in as much detail as it could have done.\n\n280.\n\nBe that as it may, the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s statement does not distort the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* findings on the content and relevance of Decree No. 165. It remains an *obiter dictum. Obiter dicta* are not grounds for annulment since they are without relevance for the decision and are not outcome-determinative. The decisive finding of the Resubmission Tribunal is the first sentence of paragraph 198 according to which none of the controversial propositions by the Parties has a \"material bearing.\"\n\n281.\n\nThis determination dovetails the First Tribunal\u2019s finding and thus respects the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award. It had decided that the expropriation had been completed irrespective of its illegality. The Resubmission Tribunal accepts this result as *res iudicata.* It had no authority to re-open this issue. The Applicants\u2019 reproach that it has failed to apply the Chilean Constitution therefore has no legal merit. This is not a matter of whether the Constitution was part of the applicable law before the Resubmission Tribunal. The point is that the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* finding that the expropriation was an instantaneous act occurring at the date of Decree No. 165, together with its reasoning that \"[\u00e0] *la connaissance du Tribunal, la validit\u00e9 du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 165 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en cause par les juridictions internes et ce d\u00e9cret fait toujours partie de l\u2019ordre juridique interne chilien,\"164* barred the Resubmission Tribunal from applying the Chilean Constitution so as to reach the opposite conclusion that the decree was not part of the Chilean legal order so that the expropriation was a continuous act.\n\nFirst Award, para. 603.\n\n282.\n\nWhatever criticism the First Tribunal\u2019s reasoning may attract, it could not be directed against the Resubmission Award. It would be concerned with the First Tribunal\u2019s finding, as confirmed as final by the First Committee.\n\n283.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the First Tribunal did not have knowledge about the nullity of Decree No. 165 and therefore decided to *\"s'aligner sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de sa validit\u00e9 en droit interne.\"165* Instead of criticizing the First Tribunal for having made a wrong decision, the Applicants asked the Resubmission Tribunal to decide anew, *\"en connaissance de cause au lieu et place du Tribunal arbitral initial,\"166* taking account also of the Chilean court decision of July 2008 which, as a consequence of the denial of justice, was rendered too late for the First Tribunal to consider.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 209; Reply on Annulment, para. 135.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Resubmission Reply of 9 January 2015, para. 212 (C-40).\n\n284.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the Applicants\u2019 assertion, the Chilean court decision of July 2008 did not acknowledge the absolute nullity of Decree No. 165. As already mentioned, the decision decided the opposite. Mr. Pey argued before the court that Decree No. 165 was *\"entach\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 de droit public, imprescriptible* [et] *incurable, qui provoque son inexistence juridique.*\"167 This was disputed by the State which asserted that the decree had been enacted in accordance with constitutional provisions applicable at the time, with the consequence that Mr. Pey\u2019s request was time-barred.168 The Court dismissed Mr. Pey\u2019s argument, reasoning that his claim was time-barred by calculating the relevant periods of time as from the enactment of the decree.169 The Chilean court\u2019s decision therefore appears to be to the effect that Decree No. 165 did exist in the Chilean legal order. One does not see how it would have changed the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that the decree was still part of the Chilean legal order.170\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008, pp. 2, 8-10 (C-282) (brackets in original).\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008, pp. 4-5 (C-282).\n\nJudgment of the 1st Civil Tribunal of Santiago, 24 July 2008, pp. 9-10 (C-282).\n\nFirst Award, para. 603.\n\n285.\n\nIn sum, therefore, by aligning itself on the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* assessment, the Resubmission Tribunal complied with its obligation pursuant to Articles 52 and 53 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) to recognize the non-annulled parts of the First Award as final. In doing so, it did not exceed its power nor did it express bias against the Applicants.\n\n286.\n\n*The second sentence in paragraph 198* summarises the Applicants\u2019 argument that Decree No. 165 was illegal, that the physical seizure was not a legally effective expropriation and that, therefore, the Applicants were still the legal owners of the shares and the assets. This cannot be a distortion of the Applicants\u2019 argument, since they state unequivocally that they *\"continuent aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 \u00eatre les propri\u00e9taires l\u00e9gaux de tous les biens et droit du Groupe Clarin\"171*\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 681.\n\n287.\n\nThe Applicants further assert that the Resubmission Tribunal implies, in *the third and fourth sentence of paragraph 198,* that the Applicants brought arguments which in fact they never brought, namely that \"the First Tribunal was wrong in its finding that the expropriation was excluded *ratione temporis* from the scope of the BIT\" and \"that what amounted in effect (if not in form) to the expropriation took place with Decision No. 43.\"172\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 77. 79, 80. quoting, *inter alia.* Resubmission Award, para. 198; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 687-694.\n\n288.\n\nAs concerns the first limb of this argument, the Applicants had asked the Resubmission Tribunal to decide that Decree No. 165 was null and void *ab initio, \"en connaissance de cause au lieu et place du Tribunal arbitral initial\"173* This was an invitation to correct the First Tribunal\u2019s finding. Even if the Applicants exonerate the First Tribunal from having committed an error by insisting that they did not know better, they nevertheless argue that it appeared - *ex post -* \"wrong\" to regard Decree No. 165 as valid, and, as an alleged consequence, that the expropriation was completed. The Committee therefore does not find any evidence of bias against the Applicants in the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s assumption that the Applicants believed that the First Tribunal *\"was wrong in its finding\"* and that their request in effect, albeit indirectly, amounted to requesting the Resubmission Tribunal to overturn *res iudicata* findings of the First Award.\n\nResubmission Reply of 9 January 2015, para. 212 (C-40).\n\n289.\n\nAlong the same lines, the Resubmission Tribunal did not distort the Applicants\u2019 request and argument that it should grant compensation for the violation of fair and equitable treatment based on the value of the expropriated assets because the denial of justice had prevented the Chilean court decision being available in time for the First Tribunal to consider. This request was adequately summarised by the Resubmission Tribunal at paragraph 196 of the Resubmission Award:\n\n[T]he central consequence of the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press, was that they (the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely null (ex *tunc)* and as such incapable of producing any legal effects. Had they been in a position to do so, the argument continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able to recover their confiscated property in Chile, or **at the least would have been able to establish before the First Tribunal that the expropriation of this property was not an instantaneous act taking final effect in 1975, but was not in fact completed until many years later, and the result of that would have been that the expropriation did indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal under the BIT,** contrary to the findings in the First Award. From this it follows, so the Claimants\u2019 argument concludes, that the loss suffered by them arising out of the denial of justice is the loss of that right to compensation in the original arbitration, so that such loss is the one they can now claim in the present proceedings.174\n\nResubmission Award, para. 196 (emphasis added).\n\n290.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal then - implicitly but certainly - rejected this thesis at paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award, where it reasoned that the Applicants\u2019 position was incompatible with the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that the expropriation had been completed with the physical taking in 1975, as well as with Decision No. 43 which purported to grant compensation for an expropriation that had already occurred.175 Accordingly, the Resubmission Tribunal did not distort the Applicants\u2019 position and neither does its handling of the request and argument evidence any bias to the detriment of the Applicants.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 198.\n\n291.\n\nThe second limb of the Applicants\u2019 argument as to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s alleged bias evidenced by the fourth sentence of paragraph 198 concerns the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s incriminated assumption on the Applicants\u2019 conclusion on Decision No. 43. The Applicants criticise the Resubmission Tribunal for assuming that they regarded Decision No. 43 as the expropriatory act, so as to oppose it to them. However, in considering, as it does, the various \"conclusions the Claimants would seek to draw [...] so far as the remedies available in the present proceedings are concerned,\" and in observing that \"[a]s the Tribunal sees it, there are only two,\" the Resubmission Tribunal does not seek to attribute to the Applicants a thesis which was not theirs, but considers all possible ways to make concrete the Applicants\u2019 position in a manner that might possibly warrant the granting of compensation. There is no evidence of bias in these reasons.\n\n292.\n\nAs concerns *the fifth sentence of paragraph 198* of the Resubmission Award, the Applicants had argued during the resubmission phase that the First Tribunal had considered Decree No. 165 *\"faisait toujours partie de l\u2019ordre juridique interne chilien, et, par voie de cons\u00e9quence, que les dispositions de l'article 5 de l'API \u00e9taient inapplicables aux faits de confiscation.\"176* This assertion justifies the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s statement in the fifth sentence of paragraph 198 that the arguments with respect to the continuous character of the expropriation and the effect of Decision No. 43 \"figured, in various forms, in the submissions of the Claimants in the course of these submission proceedings.\" The Committee does not find any basis for annulment in this statement.\n\nResubmission Memorial of 27 June 2014. para. 286 (C-8) (footnotes omitted).\n\n293.\n\n*The sixth sentence of paragraph 198* of the Resubmission Award prepares the following sentences and mentions \"insuperable difficulties\" of the Applicants\u2019 proposals, as assessed by the Resubmission Tribunal. In *sentences seven and eight,* the Resubmission Tribunal summarises the First Tribunal\u2019s determination correctly that the expropriation was completed in 1975 and states that it has no authority to \"hear an appeal against that finding.\" The Committee does not find any basis for annulment in these statements. With respect to Decision No. 43, the Resubmission Tribunal reiterates that the Claimants\u2019 conclusions do not correspond to the First Tribunal\u2019s chronology and are in themselves based on the completed act of expropriation. Again, these statements do not distort the First Tribunal\u2019s findings.\n\n294.\n\nIn *the last sentence of paragraph 198,* the Resubmission Tribunal makes an observation on the alleged nullity of Decree No. 165 under Chilean law.177 The Resubmission Tribunal believes that \"if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decree No. 165 did indeed have decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment continued to be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation - the remedy for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal in these resubmission proceedings.\"\n\nInitially, the Resub mission Tribunal had referred to Decision No. 43 instead of Decree No. 165. It lias rectified this to his mind \"purely clerical\" error in paragraph 52 of its Decision on Rectification, in accordance with the Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification of 27 October 2016. The Committee uses the rectified version of the Resubmission Award and does not discuss the Claimants\u2019 arguments as far as they are based on the non-corrected version, as in paragraph 233 of the Annulment Application and paragraphs 76 ss. of the Reply on Annulment.\n\n295.\n\nThe Applicants allege that *\"la cons\u00e9quence de ces contradictions \u00e9tant de submerger les Demanderesses dans le d\u00e9ni de justice le plus absolu consistant en ce que la 2\u00e8me Sentence d\u00e9cline (\u00a7216) en faveur de \u2018la sph\u00e8re domestique\u2019 la comp\u00e9tence pour porter rem\u00e8de au d\u00e9ni par l'\u00c9tat Chilien, depuis le 24 mai 1995, des droits des Demanderesses sur leur investissement que la Sentence initiale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous la protection de l\u2019API\"178*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 237.\n\n296.\n\nThe Committee does not share the Applicants\u2019 analysis. The Resubmission Tribunal does not renounce exercising the powers it otherwise has in favour of the domestic sphere. In the preceding sentences of paragraph 198, and in the last sentence itself, the Resubmission Tribunal makes it explicit that, for reasons totally unrelated to any recourse the Applicants may or may not have in the domestic sphere, the Resubmission Tribunal cannot, in accordance with the applicable international law, grant the Applicants the reparation requested. Accordingly, while the Resubmission Tribunal may have been wrong in suggesting that \"the remedy [...] could lie in the domestic sphere,\" this did not constitute a denial of justice, nor did it evidence any bias to the detriment of the Applicants.\n\n297.\n\nIn fact, the Resubmission Award echoes the First Award. When discussing the compensation granted by Decision No. 43 to the non-owners instead of Mr. Pey Casado whom the First Tribunal had identified as the real owner and investor, the First Award distinguishes clearly between the spheres of domestic law and international law. It states: \"[q]*uoi qu\u2019il en soit de la pertinence et de la valeur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en droit interne chilien, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ne peuvent pr\u00e9valoir sur les consid\u00e9rations qui ont conduit le Tribunal arbitral aux conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, en application des dispositions de I'API.\"179*\n\nFirst Award, para. 669.\n\n298.\n\nThe First Tribunal had concluded that the Applicants were entitled to compensation for the consequences of the violation of Chile\u2019s obligation to treat the Claimants fairly and equitably in adopting Decision No. 43 in 2000 but not to compensation for the internationally wrongful act of illegal expropriation. The latter was precluded in international law *ratione temporis* but not necessarily in national law. This is the reason why both tribunals have urged Chile to compensate the Claimants and to *\"r\u00e9tablir la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 et r\u00e9parer les dommages caus\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime militaire,\"* in light of the *\"invalidit\u00e9 des confiscations\"180* The First Tribunal does not doubt the illegality of the expropriation under Chilean law and the entitlement to compensation under Chilean law but sees no possibility to repair the damages under international law, given the inapplicability \"ratione temporis *des obligations de fonds contenues dans TAPI\"181*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 667-668, 669.\n\nFirst Award, para. 577.\n\n299.\n\nThis is what the Resubmission Tribunal expresses in the last sentence of paragraph 198 of its Resubmission Award. It does not violate the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award but to the contrary, it abides by it. The Committee does not find partiality in a determination that respects this effect.\n\n300.\n\nIn sum, the Applicants\u2019 perception of injustice indeed results from the fact that a violent confiscation by a military regime, which is wrongful, illegal and anti-constitutional under national law, is not sanctioned by an international arbitral tribunal. However, to the Committee\u2019s mind, this result is not attributable to the Resubmission Tribunal but to the *res iudicata* adjudication of the First Tribunal on the applicability of the law of expropriation under international law, which itself echoed the difficulties inherent in bringing a claim on the basis of a BIT for facts originating before the BIT\u2019s entry into force.\n\n**B. The Appointment of Mr. Alexis Mourre and the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s APPROACH TO THE APPLICANTS\u2019 REQUESTS FOR HIS REMOVAL**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe Applicants asserted three grounds for annulment relating to Mr. Mourre\u2019s appointment by Chile, and the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s failure to take action on his removal from the Tribunal:\n\n(a) That the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a));\n\n(b) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); and\n\n(c) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)).\n\nIn their Reply on Annulment, the Applicants withdrew their assertion that the Tribunal failed in this respect to state the reasons on which its award is based.182\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 260.\n\n302.\n\nWith respect to the improper constitution of the Tribunal, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n303.\n\nDuring the first arbitration Chile forfeited its right to appoint one of the arbitrators when the arbitrator it had appointed resigned without the consent of the Tribunal. The resignation triggered the application of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention which provides that in such circumstances the \"Chairman [of the Administrative Council] shall appoint a person from the appropriate Panel to fill the resulting vacancy.\"\n\n304.\n\nThe objective of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention is, according to an explicatory note of the ICSID Secretariat \"to lessen the possibility of a party inducing an arbitrator appointed by it to resign, so as either to enable his replacement by a more tractable person or merely to delay the proceeding.\"183\n\nAs quoted in Annulment Application, para. 63.\n\n305.\n\nThe objective justifies the exception of the normal principle, according to which vacancies are to be filled in the same way as the original appointments. It reflects, in the words of A. Broches, \"the suspicion that the party [that made the original appointment] may not be a stranger to the resignation.\" It serves \"not only the principles of non-frustration and expediency but also the principle of the immutability.\"184\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention - A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 56, paras. 35, 37 (where Mr. Broches is cited) (CL-387). The Applicants rely on these texts in the Annulment Application, paras. 63-64, Reply on Annulment, paras. 296 ss., and during oral arguments: Tr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), pp. 244 s.\n\n306.\n\nIn the present case, the Applicants argue, the general suspicion has materialized through Chile\u2019s conduct before the First Tribunal. Chile had to admit before the ICSID Secretariat that its party appointed arbitrator) - in the words of the First Award:\n\n[A]*vait cru pouvoir communiquer* [le projet de d\u00e9cision partielle propos\u00e9 par le Pr\u00e9sident] *\u00e0 la partie qui l\u2019avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9, au m\u00e9pris de l\u2019obligation, incontest\u00e9e, de la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents de travail du Tribunal et du secret des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. L'existence de cette violation n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e, mais au contraire reconnue par d\u00e9fenderesse. Le doute subsiste seulement sur la question de savoir qui en a pris l\u2019initiative mais il n\u2019incombe pas au pr\u00e9sent Tribunal arbitral de se prononcer \u00e0 ce sujet, malgr\u00e9 les protestations et demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au CIRDI par les demanderesses.185*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 36-37.\n\n307.\n\nChile\u2019s conduct was qualified by the First Tribunal as *\"incidents parfois incompatibles avec les usages de l\u2019arbitrage international\"186*\n\nFirst Award, para. 729.\n\n308.\n\nThese findings were confirmed by the First Committee. They are *res iudicata.187*\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 54 ss.\n\n309.\n\nTherefore, the Applicants argue, Chile has lost its right to appoint an arbitrator for the totality of the proceeding, encompassing the Resubmission Proceeding,188 which are but \"a continuation of the original arbitration\" as explicitly recognised in the Resubmission Award.189 Instead, the right and duty to appoint the arbitrator which under normal circumstances would have been to be appointed by Chile, had from the moment of resignation been transferred to the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 48 ss.; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 89 ss.; Reply on Annulment, paras. 257 ss.; Tr. Day 1 (12 March 2019). pp. 251 ss.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 188.\n\n310.\n\nThis is also in line with ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) according to which the Secretary-General shall, upon receipt of an annulment request, invite the parties to proceed to constitute a new Tribunal, including the same number of arbitrators, and \"appointed by the same method, as the original one.\" Articles 50(2) and 51(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 51(3) and 55(2)(d) use the terms *\"tribunal initial\" \"tribunal ayant statu\u00e9,\"* \"original tribunal\" and \"tribunal which rendered the award\" interchangeably. The reference in ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) to the \"original\" Tribunal must therefore be interpreted as a reference to the Tribunal which rendered the award.190\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 93-102.\n\n311.\n\nThe decisions leading to Mr. Mourre\u2019s appointment and continued membership of the Resubmission Tribunal happened against systematic objections by the Applicants against every single step and decision of the Centre, the Tribunal and Mr. Mourre.191\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 74-85; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 114-119.\n\n312.\n\nIn sum, the Applicants assert that:\n\n[L]*e Centre et, par extension, le Tribunal, auraient d\u00fb prendre en compte, au moment de la constitution du tribunal de resoumission, le fait que la D\u00e9fenderesse avait perdu le droit de nommer un arbitre suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9mission de M. Franco an cours de la proc\u00e9dure initiale avec la r\u00e9probation du Tribunal initial. Le fait d'avoir autoris\u00e9 la D\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la nomination d'un arbitre en la personne de M. Mourre affecte la constitution du TR d\u2019un vice au sens de l\u2019article 52(1)(a) de la Convention.192*\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 311-312.\n\n313.\n\nWith respect to the manifest excess of power, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n314.\n\nFirst, the Resubmission Tribunal has violated ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) which provides that the \"new Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled.\"\n\n315.\n\nDuring the first arbitration, the Tribunal had determined that the Respondent\u2019s appointed arbitrator had acted improperly and had resigned without consent of the other arbitrators, that Chile had provoked incidents that were contrary to good international arbitration practice, and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council had filled the resulting vacancy by appointing Professor Gaillard. All these findings are *res iudicata.*\n\n316.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Resubmission Tribunal disrespected these *res iudicata* effects of the First Award and decided anew, thus arrogating a power that it does not have:\n\n*Or l\u2019arbitre ayant rempli la place du Professeur Emmanuel Gaillard, M. Alexis Mourre, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 par l\u2019Etat D\u00e9fendeur en enfreignant l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e de la Sentence du 8 mai 2008, notamment celle des \u00a7\u00a734, 35, 36, 37, 729 en rapport avec les paras. 5 \u00e0 7 du Dispositif, la d\u00e9cision du 25 avril 2006 du Tribunal arbitral initial et le \u00a7359(4) de la D\u00e9cision du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2012 du Comit\u00e9* ad hoc, *obligatoires pour les parties.193*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 76 (footnotes omitted); Reply on Annulment, paras. 323 ss.\n\n317.\n\nSecond, the Applicants requested that the Tribunal address the question of improper appointment of Mr. Mourre when Procedural Order No. 1 was discussed. Instead of responding to this question in accordance with the authority bestowed upon it by Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal had simply rejected the request:\n\nAt the first session, the Claimants, while indicating that they were not proposing the disqualification of the arbitrator nominated by the Respondent, nevertheless requested the Tribunal to decide whether the arbitrator in question had been duly appointed in accordance with the Convention and Arbitration Rules, and, if not, that the Tribunal invite him to resign; whereas the Respondent maintained that the arbitrator in question had been properly appointed in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention. In the absence of a proposal for disqualification under the Convention and Rules, the Tribunal does not feel called upon to rule on the matter.194\n\nDraft Procedural Order No. 1, para. 2.2 (RA-0150).\n\n318.\n\nThe Applicants submit that since a refusal to exercise authority which in fact exists constitutes as much an excess of powers as the exercise of authority which does not exist, the decision of the Tribunal *\"de ne pas trancher par la voie de l\u2019article 44 de la Convention la question relative \u00e0 la nomination irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re de Tun des arbitres, [...] constitue un tel exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste\"195*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 320.\n\n319.\n\nWith respect to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n320.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal rejected the Applicants\u2019 request to take action on the irregularity of Mr. Mourre\u2019s appointment stating that it was for the Applicants to initiate such action by a request for disqualification in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. Article 57 provides that the disqualification can be proposed on account of facts indicating \"a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14,\" or when the arbitrator \"was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"\n\n321.\n\nHowever, the Applicants consistently argued that their refusal to accept the appointment of Mr. Mourre was in no way based on any of his personal qualities but on the fact that he was appointed by a party that had forfeited its right to appointment. Therefore, *\"en imposant aux Demanderesses d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure inapplicable pour trancher la question de proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 la nomination de ce troisi\u00e8me arbitre le Tribunal a manqu\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles du proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable.\"196*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 341; Tr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), pp. 250-252.\n\n322.\n\nIt seems that the Applicants extend their assertion of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure to the Centre, when they submit that they *\"voient dans cette d\u00e9cision* [to incite the Applicants to have recourse to Article 57] ***du Centre** et du Tribunal l\u2019observation grave d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de procedure fondamentale.\"197*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 336 (emphasis added).\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Claimants\u2019 request and assertions and contends that none of the grounds evoked for annulment with respect to the appointment of Mr. Mourre exists.\n\n324.\n\nWith respect to the improper constitution of the Tribunal, the Respondent submits as follows.\n\n325.\n\nArticle 52(6) of the ICSID Convention \"identifies a closed list of Convention provisions that govern the process of constituting a resubmission tribunal,\" meaning that other Articles such as Article 56(3) are not applicable.198 Even if the Resubmission Proceeding is the continuation of the original arbitration, the Resubmission Tribunal is not a continuation of the tribunal in the original arbitration. It is, as explicitly stated in Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d), a new tribunal. This new tribunal must be constituted in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention. The unambiguous language of all provisions and their purpose leave no doubt that there is no place for the application of any further norm such as Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention, be it \"by analogy or otherwise.\"199\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 25.\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), p. 698; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 288 ss.\n\n326.\n\nIn any event, Article 56(3) cannot apply to the constitution of a tribunal because it relates to a situation that has occurred after such constitution, *i.e.* to the resignation of an arbitrator and a \"resulting\" vacancy and not the situation at the outset of the constitution of the tribunal. In addition, its plain language restricts the application to one single appointment and the replacement of one particular arbitrator. The Applicants\u2019 theory that an appointing party would be deprived of its right to appoint arbitrators again in any subsequent new proceeding contradicts not only the ordinary meaning of the terms of Articles 56(3), 52(6) and 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention but also their purpose to establish general rules for the constitution of a new tribunal, on the one hand, and react to a specific situation which has occurred thereafter, on the other.200\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 291; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 21 ss.\n\n327.\n\nThe Applicants interpret ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) as governing the composition of a new tribunal upon annulment in light of ICSID Arbitration Rule 51, which is concerned with interpretation and revision. Yet, it is useful to have revising and interpreting be done by the same tribunal that rendered the award, and only if that is not possible shall a new tribunal be constituted. The constitution of a new tribunal upon annulment is inherently different.201\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 294-295.\n\n328.\n\nTherefore, the Centre and the Resubmission Tribunal respected the procedure provided for in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules related to the constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal, and \"there is no basis whatsoever for Claimants\u2019 assertion that Chile was not entitled to appoint an arbitrator to the Resubmission Tribunal, and any annulment claim that rests on that premise must therefore be rejected.\"202\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 29.\n\n329.\n\nWith respect to the manifest excess of power, the Respondent submits as follows.\n\n330.\n\nFirst, the First Tribunal\u2019s explanations on the resignation of one arbitrator in paragraphs 34-37 of the First Award and the statement on Chile\u2019s alleged delay tactics in paragraph 729 do not amount to a binding decision with *res iudicata* effect with respect to the appointment of an arbitrator in the Resubmission Proceeding. Therefore, neither the Centre nor the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded their power when accepting the appointment of Mr. Mourre.203\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 305-310.\n\n331.\n\nSecond, the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to exercise the authority bestowed upon it by Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention. It has made a ruling on its competence in accordance with Article 41(1) when it found that no action was required with respect to Mr. Mourre\u2019s appointment in the absence of a formal request for disqualification.204\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 303.\n\n332.\n\nFurther, the Resubmission Tribunal conducted the proceeding in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Rules, when it respected the Convention\u2019s directives that the parties constitute the tribunal in accordance with Chapter IV Section 2, \"which is exactly what was done, with the Centre\u2019s blessing.\" Since there was no issue which was not covered by the Convention and no \"lacuna,\" there was no place for a decision of the Tribunal as required by Article 44 of the ICSID Convention.205\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 304.\n\n333.\n\nWith respect to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Respondent submits as follows.\n\n334.\n\nThe Applicants asserted that the Resubmission Tribunal, by requiring them to make an application for the disqualification of Mr. Mourre under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure simply because the application would have been inappropriate. They neither substantiated what fundamental rule of procedure was in focus besides another simple assertion that due process had not been respected nor of what the departure consisted. \"This is plainly not sufficient\" to apply for annulment.206\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 31.\n\n335.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent submits that the Resubmission Tribunal acted correctly when inviting the Applicants to make a formal application without which it would not be authorised to rule on the matter either by inviting Mr. Mourre to resign or the Chairman to appoint another arbitrator, since there \"is simply no mechanism in the body of ICSID norms that enables arbitrators to fire a co-arbitrator.\"207 In fact, an application in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention does not only allow for the examination of the personal qualities of an arbitrator as required according to Article 14 of the ICSID Convention but also the determination of whether \"he was ineligible for appointment.\" That is exactly what the Applicants\u2019 complaint was about. In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s invitation to make an application under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention did not depart from a procedural rule but indicated the procedurally correct way to trigger a formal determination of the lawfulness of Mr. Mourre\u2019s appointment.208\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 303.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 32.\n\n**C.

Chile was *\"un client d\u2019importance strat\u00e9gique.\"220*\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 426-428.\n\n341.\n\nThe fact that members of Essex Court Chambers not only acted in favour of but also against Chile is irrelevant for the appraisal because it *\"n\u2019explique ni n\u2019excuse l\u2019absence de r\u00e9v\u00e9lation par MM. Veeder et Berman, ou par la D\u00e9fenderesse, des liens existant entre certains membres des Essex Court Chambers et la R\u00e9publique du Chili.\"221*\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 386.\n\n342.\n\nThese are circumstances which should have caused both to decline the appointment or to step down as members of the Resubmission Tribunal, in accordance with the \"IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration.\" Theirs is the typical situation as described in Article 1.4 as part of the Non-Waivable Red List when an arbitrator derives significant financial income from advisory services that he/she or his/her law firm dispenses to a party. Essex Court Chambers must be equated to a law firm, as they present themselves like a law firm where individual barristers no longer act independently.222\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 174, 183 ss.; Reply on Annulment, paras. 438-461.\n\n343.\n\nEven if one followed the concept of the IB A Guidelines according to which \"barristers\u2019 chambers should not be equated with law firms for the purposes of conflicts, and no general standard is proffered for barristers\u2019 chambers,\" the same Guidelines provide that \"disclosure may be warranted in view of the relationships among barristers, parties or counsel.\"223 In fact, both the \"Waivable Red List\" and the \"Orange List\" require full disclosure, as widely confirmed in literature and case law.224\n\nIBA Guidelines, Explanation to General Standard 6.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 175-201.\n\n344.\n\nThe obligation of disclosure in situations where business relations exist is commonly accepted in case law, literature and guidelines on ethical and professional conduct of arbitrators. In that sense, the *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina (II)* held - in line with other committees - that \"it is for the arbitrator personally first to consider such a connection in terms of a voluntary resignation as arbitrator. Such connection must otherwise be properly disclosed to the parties through an adequate amendment of earlier declarations under Rule 6.\"225\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

LLC v. The Republic of Ecuador,* PCA Case No. AA442, Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, 8 August 2012, para. 83 (C-106).\n\n345.\n\nThis duty to disclose also extends to publicly available information since arbitrators, as explained in *Tidewater v. Venezuela,* are in a better position to gather and evaluate the accurate information than the parties who would have to conduct difficult and intrusive investigations \"and rely on indirect and not always reliable sources.\"226\n\n*Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., et al. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stem, Arbitrator. 23 December 2010, para. 17 (C-105).\n\n346.\n\nUnder the present circumstances, two connected aspects give rise to serious and objective doubts as to President Berman\u2019s and Mr. Veeder\u2019s impartiality and independence as required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention and the objectively grounded suspicion that they would seek to rule in Chile\u2019s favour: first, the close business relationship between Chile and Essex Court Chambers from which they profited, and second, the failure to conduct an inquiry on these connections and disclose them, which - in the words of Article 4.1 of the \"IBA Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrators\" - \"creates an appearance of bias, and may of itself be a ground for disqualification.\"\n\n347.\n\nIt is true that before their appointments, both President Berman and Mr. Veeder disclosed that they are members of Essex Court Chambers, and, during the disqualification procedure before the Chairman of the Administrative Council, that they did not and should not have had knowledge about relations between Chile and other members of their Chambers. These declarations are reproduced in the Chairman\u2019s \"Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Sir Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC\" of 21 February 2017, in paragraphs 13 and 14. Such declarations are, the Applicants submit, des *\"tromperie*[s] *\"* and *\"mensong\u00e8re*[s] *\" :*\n\n*Que les arbitres n 'aient pas connaissance des montants pr\u00e9cis en cause peut se comprendre. Qu 'ils pr\u00e9tendent n 'avoir pas eu connaissance de l'intervention de leurs coll\u00e8gues pour la R\u00e9publique du Chili rel\u00e8ve en revanche de la gageure.227*\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 469, 493; *see also* Annulment Application, para. 157.\n\n348.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, not only have President Berman and Mr. Veeder failed to make a full disclosure of their Chambers\u2019 long-standing, close, and lucrative relationship with Chile, they have stubbornly, fraudulently and in bad faith refused to start or even facilitate an in-depth inquiry into this relationship.228\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 86-174; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 204-226; Reply on Annulment, paras. 492-497.\n\n349.\n\nThis conduct leaves no doubt that both President Berman and Mr. Veeder manifestly lack the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that they cannot \"be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" In fact, the doubt and suspicion have amply materialized, since both arbitrators demonstrated a systematic bias in favor of Chile.\n\n350.\n\nFor these reasons, both President Berman and Mr. Veeder must be disqualified, the Resubmission Tribunal was not properly constituted and the *ad hoc* Committee must annul the Award.\n\n351.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee has the authority and the duty to proceed accordingly.\n\n352.\n\nIt is true that the Chairman of the Administrative Council formally rejected the request for disqualification on two occasions and for different reasons by his two Decisions \"on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC\" dated 21 February 2017 and 13 April 2017. It is also true that other *ad hoc* committees - for instance in *EDF v. Argentina* and *Suez v. Argentina -* have found that in such circumstances:\n\n[T]he role of an *ad hoc* committee is not to determine whether or not an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality; Articles 57 and 58 entrust that function to the remaining members of the tribunal, or to the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Only if the matter is raised for the first time after the proceedings are closed does the *ad hoc* committee become the primary decision-maker in respect of this issue;229\n\nand:\n\n[A] decision has been made on this issue [of the proper constitution of the Tribunal] in the underlying proceedings and in light of the context as well as the object and purpose of the annulment proceeding, it is not for this Committee to perform a *de novo* review of any issues decided in the underlying proceedings.230\n\n*EDF International SA., SA UR International SA. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas SA. v*. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23 *(\"EDF v.

They ruled that an *ad hoc* committee has the authority to determine the reasons for the disqualification of arbitrators anew, if the Chairman\u2019s decision \"not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"232 Both committees have correctly dismissed the narrow approach of the *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix v*. *Argentina* which had held that a committee \"would only be able to annul an award under Article 52(1)(a) if there had been a failure to comply properly with the procedure for challenging members of the tribunal set out in other provisions of the ICSID Convention.\"233 The *Azurix* approach neglects evidently the necessity to protect the ICSID system against partial and biased tribunals.234 The broad power of *ad hoc* committees to appreciate *de novo* a challenge previously decided upon by the Chairman of the Administrative Council finds further support in the annulment committee\u2019s decision in *Mobil v*. *Argentina.235*\n\n*EDFv.

Further, they constitute a serious departure from ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 and an excess of power, together with (in the case of the Decision of 13 April 2017) a lack of reasons.236\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 124-175; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 130-147; Reply on Annulment, paras. 367-404 ss.\n\n356.\n\nWith respect to the Decision of 21 February 2017, which rejects the proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder for purely procedural reasons, the Chairman has simply followed Chile\u2019s biased arguments and documentation through press clippings covering a period from 2012 to 2016, according to which the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers were publicly known and regularly reported in the press.\n\n357.\n\nThe Chairman has taken these submissions to deduce that *\"les Demanderesses auraient d\u00fb avoir connaissance du fait que certains membres des Essex Court Chambers intervenaient ou \u00e9taient intervenus par le pass\u00e9 pour la R\u00e9publique du Chili au moment du d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure en resoumission.\"237* In reality, the press clippings mention a number of people acting as counsel for Chile but none mentions Essex Court Chambers itself. The available information was not detailed and notorious enough to arouse doubts and suspicion and it would have been manifestly unreasonable and excessive to start a systematic inquiry on the connection of the individuals mentioned with Chile and Essex Court Chambers. Before appointing Mr. Veeder, the Applicants had searched for a person who would guarantee quality, prestige and independence and be \"at the level of the President,\"238 who was member of Essex Court Chambers.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 375.\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), pp. 677 s.\n\n358.\n\nIt was not the Applicants\u2019 duty to investigate relations between Essex Court Chambers and Chile but the arbitrators\u2019 duty to disclose it.\n\n359.\n\nOnly a few days after the notification of the Resubmission Award, on 18 September 2016, the press published an article which revealed relations between Chile and a member of Essex Court Chambers, specifying that until then these relations had been kept secret (\"*sigilosca\").* The Applicants acted promptly upon this information. As from 20 September 2016, they started to investigate the relations themselves, and they requested in repeated communications to the Centre, that the arbitrators conduct an in-depth inquiry into the relations, which was refused in bad faith.\n\n360.\n\nThe Chairman of the Administrative Council exceeded his powers, departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and acted unreasonably by:\n\n- assuming that it was the Applicants\u2019 duty to conduct a conflict search;\n\n- believing Chile\u2019s arguments, failing to examine the press clippings and to add even new ones *sua sponte* that he had never shared with the Applicants;\n\n- not ordering Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder to make an inquiry into the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers;\n\n- not taking into consideration that the relations had been kept secret and therefore out of reach of the Applicants; and\n\n- defining the period from which to determine whether the Applicants had acted \"promptly\" in the sense of Rules 9 and 27 from the moment of the appointment of the arbitrators and not from the moment when the Applicants started to have access to secret information, which would undoubtedly lead him to understand that *\"le caract\u00e8re prompt de la r\u00e9action des Demanderesses est manifeste.\"239*\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 126-140; Reply on Annulment, paras. 367-404.\n\n361.\n\nWith respect to the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 13 April 2017 rejecting the proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder, the Applicants assert that the Chairman has blindly believed Mr. Veeder\u2019s consciously false and prejudiced statements on his motivation why he had resigned from an arbitral tribunal in a different case under circumstances similar to the ones in the present case. The Chairman has failed to appraise the Applicants\u2019 evidence proving that Mr. Veeder\u2019s intention was to occult the fact that objectively the resignation was motivated by facts identical to the facts in the present case. By not taking these facts into consideration, the Chairman reached the untenable and unreasonable decision not to disqualify Mr. Veeder.\n\n362.\n\nTherefore, the Committee must disregard the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 13 April 2017 and annul the Resubmission Award.240\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 141-165.\n\n363.\n\nWith respect to the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 13 April 2017 rejecting the proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman, the Applicants assert a failure to apply the law. The Chairman has rejected the proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin, although the latter had written a letter on 1 March 2017 whereby he announced that he would abstain from fulfilling his obligations under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. The letter evidences *\"d\u2019un d\u00e9faut de motifs et d\u2019un biais qualifi\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable \u00e9vident \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celles-ci* [the Applicants], *incompatible avec des principes fondamentaux du droit* -due process- *et le niveau d\u2019exigence de neutralit\u00e9 et impartialit\u00e9 des articles 57, 14(1) et 42(1) en rapport avec les articles 52(1)e) et 52(1)(d) de la Convention du CIRDI.\"241*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 169; *see also* Applicants\u2019 Letter of 11 March 2017 (C-162).\n\n364.\n\nThe Centre, in a *\"co\u00efncidence imm\u00e9diate\"242* had accepted President Berman\u2019s withdrawal from the exercise of his functions under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and decided that the Chairman would decide the matter although nothing in the Convention authorises him to do so. This is an issue of the international *ordre public,* and the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 13 April 2017 is a manifestation of an excess of power with lack of reasons and a serious departure from Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.243\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 171.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 172-173.\n\n365.\n\nFor all these reasons, both Decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council are untenable, unreasonable and made in violation of basic provisions of the ICSID Convention. The *ad hoc* Committee must not take them in consideration and determine *de novo* whether President Berman and Mr. Veeder must be disqualified and, as a consequence, whether the Tribunal was not properly constituted, which is beyond doubt.\n\n366.\n\nWith respect to the manifest excess of powers, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n367.\n\nFive decisions constitute an excess of power and warrant the annulment of the Award based on Article 52(1)(b).\n\n368.\n\nFirst, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, communicated by letter of 21 November 2016244 to refuse full disclosure of the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers.245\n\nICSID Letter communicating the Decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, 21 November 2016 (C-134).\n\nAnnulment Application, headline before para. 110.\n\n369.\n\nSecond, the decision taken by President Berman in his letter of 1 March 2017 not to fulfil his duty to participate in the procedure leading to the disqualification of Mr. Veeder, as complemented by the Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council, dated 13 April 2017, to take over this duty.\n\n370.\n\nWhile President Berman refused to exercise a power which was bestowed upon him through Article 58 of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman arrogated a power that he did not have.246\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 169, 173.\n\n371.\n\nThe Applicants do not specify in what way the excess of power was manifest.\n\n372.\n\nThird, the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 21 February 2017, not to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder for purely procedural reasons, whereas even assuming barristers are not supposed to know the activities of other members of their Chambers, a reasonable inquiry must nevertheless be held once the relevant facts become known, *\"car le devoir de* disclosure *est permanent\"247*\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 126, 139.\n\n373.\n\nThe consequence of the excess of power manifested in this decision is that the *ad hoc* Committee must annul the Resubmission Award in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.248\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 140.\n\n374.\n\nThe Applicants do not specify in what way the excess of power was manifest.\n\n375.\n\nFourth, the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 13 April 2017, to refuse Applicants access to the ICSID archives, where they would have found evidence on Mr. Veeder\u2019s untruthful declarations, and to reject the proposal to disqualify him without addressing the objectively pertinent issues that the Applicants had put before him.249\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 157.\n\n376.\n\nThis conduct of the Chairman constitutes an excess of power, from which it follows that the Committee must annul the Award in accordance with Article 52(1)(b).250\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 165, 174.\n\n377.\n\nThe Applicants do not specify in what way the excess of power was manifest.\n\n378.\n\nFifth, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal dated 15 June 2017 to refuse the well-founded Applicants\u2019 request to order Chile to produce documents to evidence the closeness and dimension of the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers. Chile had refused to produce these documents on 12 April 2017 without valid reason,251 as later stated by Chilean courts.252\n\nChile\u2019s Response to President Allende Foundation\u2019s Counsel, 12 April 2017 (C-138).\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 181.\n\n379.\n\nThe incomprehensible253 refusal by the Resubmission Tribunal to order the production of documents in accordance with Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 53/34(2)(a), which would have proven that the premises of the Chairman\u2019s Decision on the disqualification did not exist, demonstrate that \"[l]es *comportements du Tribunal de Resoumission et de l\u2019\u00c9tat D\u00e9fendeur sont objectivement concordants en vue de pr\u00e9server l 'opacit\u00e9 des rapports entre ce dernier et les* chambers *dont sont membres deux des arbitres\"254* In fact, the Resubmission Tribunal has acted fraudulently and outside its competence and immunity when it refused information in concertation with Chile, a strategic client of their Chambers.255\n\nThe Applicants rely on *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.

The Applicants rely on *EDF v*. *Argentina,* where the *ad hoc* committee held:\n\nIf an award may be tainted by the fact that a decision whether or not to disqualify an arbitrator was taken in a manner which was procedurally deficient, *a fortiori* an award may be tainted by the fact that the award itself was adopted by a tribunal one or more of whose members did not meet the requisite standard of impartiality and independence.\n\nThe Committee therefore considers that the fact that there is reasonable doubt about whether an arbitrator possessed the qualities of independence and impartiality required by Article 14(1) is a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(d).256\n\n*EDFv. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment. 5 February 2016, paras. 124-125 (C-103).\n\n384.\n\nSecond, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, communicated by letter of 21 November 2016, to refuse full disclosure of the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers \"[constitue] *un manque de neutralit\u00e9 et d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 de la part du Tribunal et de chacun de ses membres et une inobservance grave des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure applicables (R\u00e8gle n\u00b0 6 en rapport avec l\u2019article 14)1) de la Convention), sanctionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 52(1)(a) de la Convention.\"257*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 123, as reiterated at para. 117. The Committee considers that the reference to Article 52(1)(a) is a clerical error.\n\n385.\n\nThird, the Decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council of 21 February 2017 and 13 April 2017 with respect to the disqualification of Mr. Veeder constitute a serious departure from Article 6 of the ICSID Convention, and with respect to the disqualification of Sir Franklin Berman a serious departure from Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention. The decisions cannot validate the serious departure from procedural rules applicable during the processing of the proposals for disqualification.\n\n386.\n\nFourth, both the decision taken by Sir Franklin Berman in his letter of 1 March 2017 not to fulfil his duty to participate in the procedure leading to the disqualification of Mr. Veeder, and the complementary Decision by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, dated 13 April 2017, to take over this duty, constitute a serious departure from Article 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention. They cannot validate the serious departure from *\"des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure applicables lors du traitement des propositions de r\u00e9cusation de M. Berman.\"258*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 173 and headline before para. 166.\n\n387.\n\nFifth, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, dated 15 June 2017, to refuse the well-founded Applicants\u2019 request to order Chile to produce documents to evidence the closeness and dimension of the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for the same reasons that it exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s power, as shown in paragraphs 366 ss. here above.259\n\nAnnulment Application, title before para. 176.\n\n388.\n\nWith respect to the failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n389.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal failed to state the reasons why it did not apply ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) despite the Applicants\u2019 repeated requests in that sense.260\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 123 and title before para. 86.\n\n390.\n\nIn his letter of 1 March 2017, President Berman failed to state the reasons why he denied fulfilling his duty to participate in the procedure to disqualify Mr. Veeder despite repeated communications from the Applicants.261\n\nAnnulment Application, title before para. 166.\n\n391.\n\nThe Chairman of the Administrative Council has failed to state the reasons why it accepted to rule on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder dated 24 February 2017.262\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 173.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Resubmission Award because the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention) and because an award rendered by an improperly constituted Tribunal represents a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention) is without merit.263\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 311-336; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 35-53.\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondent asserts as follows:\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal was properly constituted in late 2013 and beginning 2014, in accordance with Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention (\"Constitution of the Tribunal\"). Chile appointed Mr. Mourre. The Secretary-General appointed Sir Franklin Berman who had declared that he was member of Essex Court Chambers. Sir Franklin Berman\u2019s appointment having been accepted by both Parties, and the Applicants appointed Mr. Veeder, knowing full well that he, like Sir Franklin Berman, was a member of Essex Court Chambers.264\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 163-181.\n\n395.\n\nThe Applicants have not objected to the constitution of the Tribunal. In reality, they contest the composition and not the constitution of the Tribunal, which is not a ground for annulment.265\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 331; Rejoinder on Annulment, para. 38.\n\n396.\n\nFurther, and more importantly, the Chairman of the Administrative Council confirmed the proper constitution of the Tribunal in two Decisions on the Applicants\u2019 repeated proposals to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder.\n\n397.\n\nThe Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Award amounts to an appeal against the Decisions of the Chairman, which is inadmissible: \"an annulment committee cannot re-open or second-guess the legal and factual findings set forth in a challenge decision.\"266 Unlike what the Applicants assert, the annulment committee in *Mobil v*. *Argentina* did not widen the scope of permissible review in such circumstances, but explicitly validated the approach taken by the annulment committees in *EDF v. Argentina* and *Suez v. Argentina.267*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 328.\n\nChile\u2019s submission regarding *Mobil v. Argentina* decision, 1 July 2019, pp. 1-2.\n\n398.\n\nAs far as the Applicants ask the Committee to disregard the Decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council and decide on the disqualification *de novo,* because they are allegedly plainly unreasonable, the argument is unfounded. First, the \"Challenge Decision [...] was reasoned, well supported, and consistent with the jurisprudence on the timeliness of challenges.\"268 Second, the Applicants\u2019 request and \"theory [appear] to part from the premise that, until 18 September 2016, it simply was unknowable that certain Essex Court Chambers barristers had been representing Chile in ICJ proceedings.\" That is simply not true because the facts were repeatedly reported in the Chilean press and were also readily accessible on different websites. Chile\u2019s objections to disclose sensitive documents in local Chilean courts do not change the general evidence that \"Chile\u2019s representation by Essex Court Chambers barristers in ICJ matters had long been public knowledge.\" The Chairman of the Administrative Council had based his Decision of 21 February 2017 on these facts, which is plainly reasonable.269\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 332.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, paras. 46, 49 (footnotes omitted); Counter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 329-330.\n\n399.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Applicants\u2019 proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin and Mr. Veeder was untimely. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1), it should have been made \"promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed.\" The Respondent relies on the *EDF v. Argentina* annulment decision, where the committee found:\n\n[A] party which is, or should have been, aware of the facts which it claims give rise to reasonable doubt about whether an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality has a duty to raise the issue promptly. [...] A party which could have raised the matter under Articles 57 and 58 before the proceedings were declared closed but failed to do so cannot, therefore, raise it on annulment.270\n\n*EDFv. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016, para. 131 (C-103).\n\n400.\n\nIn any event, Chile\u2019s representation by other Essex Court Chambers barristers in unrelated cases has not caused a conflict of interest that may shed an objective and justifiable doubt on President Berman\u2019s or Mr. Veeder\u2019s independence and impartiality. They both disclosed their membership, they both did not and were not supposed to know about the activities of other members, they both acted as self-employed sole practitioners, as explained on the Essex Court Chambers website,271 and the Applicants did not doubt their independence when they appointed one member of Essex Court Chambers after having approved another member of the same Chambers. The Respondent quotes an eminent tribunal\u2019s conviction that there is no:\n\n[H]ard-and-fast rule to the effect that barristers from the same Chambers are always precluded from being involved as, respectively, counsel and arbitrator in the same case. Equally, however, there is no absolute rule to opposite effect. The justifiability of an apprehension of partiality depends on all relevant circumstances.272\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, paras. 52-53.\n\n*Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d. v.

The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the evidence and burden of proof**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe Applicants have asserted three grounds for annulment relating to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the evidence that they have presented regarding the damage sustained by them as a consequence of Chile\u2019s violation of the BIT and of the burden of proof in that respect:\n\n(a) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n(b) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(c) That the Resubmission Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).275\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 238-251; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 584-680; Reply on Annulment, paras. 146-234.\n\n404.\n\nThe Applicants argue that most of the facts and arguments presented under this heading relate at the same time to the disregard of the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award but have chosen to separate the issues. The approach does not cause inconveniences except for possible redundancies, and the Committee accepts it.\n\n405.\n\nWith respect to a manifest excess of powers, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n406.\n\n\"[L]*e rejet des arguments et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les Demanderesses et se rapportant \u00e0 la d\u00e9monstration de leur pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sultant des violations identifi\u00e9es par la Sentence Initiale constitue un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste.\"276*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 147; Annulation Request, para. 239; Memorial on Annulment, para. 598.\n\n407.\n\nThe Applicants assert that they have consistently provided detailed and coherent arguments and evidence with regard to the damages caused by the unfair and unequitable treatment by Chile both in their written submissions and in oral presentation during the Resubmission Proceeding and through financial expertise. As summarised during the hearing before the Resubmission Tribunal on 13 April 2015:\n\n[N]*ous avons \u00e9tabli que la violation du d\u00e9ni de justice et l'absence de jugement de la premi\u00e8re Chambre civile de Santiago a finalement d\u00e9truit le droit \u00e0 r\u00e9paration des Demanderesses au titre de l'API en application de son article 5 devant le Tribunal arbitral.*\n\n*Dans ces conditions, d\u00e8s lors que le dommage doit venir r\u00e9tablir les Demanderesses dans la situation dans laquelle elles se seraient trouv\u00e9es en l'absence de violation, et donc en l'absence de d\u00e9ni de justice, la position que nous d\u00e9fendons est que la violation de l'article 4 et le d\u00e9ni de justice du Chili doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9s en accordant une r\u00e9paration aux Demanderesses \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle qu'elles auraient d\u00fb obtenir au titre des confiscations.277*\n\nTranscript of the hearing before the Resubmission Tribunal (13 April 2013), p. 41 (C-43); *see also* Annulment Application, para. 231.\n\n408.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal refused to take the evidence into consideration as far as it clarifies the circumstances of the violent confiscation in 1973. It reasons that:\n\n[I]*t is res judicata* both (positively) that the breach consists in the composite failure to accord fair and equitable treatment (including the avoidance of denial of justice), and also (negatively) that the expropriation of the original investment is outside the temporal scope of the BIT, so that all evidence and argument related to that expropriation is to be excluded as not relevant to the dispute other than as background facts.278\n\nResubmission Award, para. 217 and repeated in paras. 228 and 230.\n\n409.\n\nIn reality, the First Tribunal had determined, *res iudicata,* that facts preceding the date of the BIT, *i.e.* 29 March 1994, must be taken into consideration when examining the factual context of the acts that the Applicants have qualified as violations of the BIT after its entry into force.279\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 167 where the Applicants refer to First Award, paras. 611 and 612.\n\n410.\n\nTherefore, the Resubmission Tribunal failed to exercise its power and to examine the evidence brought before it concerning *\"les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fait ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'API.\"280*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 167.\n\n411.\n\nAt the same time, the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers when refusing to take issues into consideration that occurred after *(\"post\u00e9rieur\")281* 3 November 1997, the date of the initial request for arbitration. On another occasion, the Applicants submitted that the Tribunal has *\"ind\u00fbment d\u00e9clin\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence s\u2019agissant d\u2019actes de d\u00e9ni de justice post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la Sentence Initiale,\"282* which is 8 May 2008.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, p. 166, paras. 326, 586 ss., 669; Reply on Annulment, para. 233; Annulment Application, paras. 232-236.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 570.\n\n412.\n\nThe Applicants observe that with respect to the denial of justice occurring after the First Award, the Resubmission Tribunal has stated that this argument falls outside of its jurisdiction, which is limited to to the dispute submitted to the First Tribunal and for which the critical date was the original Request for Arbitration:\n\nThe Tribunal should also interpolate at this point that part of the argument addressed to it by the Claimants in these resubmission proceedings was to the effect that the actions of the Respondent, since the handing down of the First Award, constituted a new denial of justice for which compensation is due, and can be awarded in these resubmission proceedings. This is an argument that the Tribunal must reject outright. The reason is not only that allegations of that kind would have to be subjected to a proper process of evidence and proof before they could properly come to decision in an arbitral process (which indeed they would); it is quite simply that the entire argument falls plainly outside the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal, which (as already indicated) is limited, under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 55 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, exclusively to \u2018the dispute\u2019 or such parts of it as remain in being after the annulment. That can only be taken to refer to \u2018the dispute\u2019 that had been submitted to arbitration in the first place, the critical date for which was the Claimants\u2019 original request for arbitration. Issues arising between the Parties after that date - and still more so issues arising out of post-Award conduct - cannot by any stretch of the imagination fall within the scope of resubmission proceedings under the provisions cited above, and the Tribunal sees no need to say more about the matter in this Award.283\n\nResubmission Award, para. 216.\n\n413.\n\nThe Applicants assert that this reasoning contradicts the first Tribunal\u2019s assessment of Chile\u2019s violations of Article 4 of the BIT that is based on factual and legal elements that have occurred between 1995 and 2002, *i.e.* the proceeding before the Chilean court on the restitution of the Goss machine, and the compensation of persons other than Mr. Pey through Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000. They reduce the Applicants\u2019 rights to present arguments and evidence referring to events after 1997.\n\n414.\n\nThis excess of power is manifest because it can be distilled without a problem by simply reading the First Award, the First Annulment Decision, the Resubmission Award and by recalling a *\"besoin \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire: en quoi une base de chiffrage peut-elle \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inexacte pour toute \u00e9valuation au pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019une pr\u00e9tention n\u2019apas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e* ratione temporis.\"284\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 620.\n\n415.\n\nThe Applicants rely on a commentator of the Resubmission Award, Professor Benjamin Remy, who expressed doubts as to the rejection of the evidence:\n\n*En revanche, elle n'interdit pas que, dans le cadre de l'examen de la demande d'indemnisation du pr\u00e9judice subi du fait du d\u00e9ni de justice, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la confiscation soit \u00e9voqu\u00e9e. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ce pr\u00e9judice consistait en une perte de chance pour l'investisseur d\u2019obtenir gain de cause aupr\u00e8s des juridictions chiliennes. [...] Il est seulement question de savoir si, au regard du seul droit chilien, la pr\u00e9tention formul\u00e9e par l\u2019investisseur devant les juges chiliens avait des chances de prosp\u00e9rer et de fixer le montant des indemnit\u00e9s que l'investisseur aurait pu esp\u00e9rer. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les arguments relatifs aux confiscations de 1973, ainsi utilis\u00e9s, ne devraient donc pas se heurter \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e de la sentence initiale285*\n\nBenjamin Remy, \"Chronique des sentences arbitrates\", J.D.I. (Clunet), 2017, pp. 282-283.\n\n416.\n\nWith respect to a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n417.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal has systematically accepted Chile\u2019s arguments and its negative characterisation of the First Award and the First Annulment Decision, to the detriment of the Applicants\u2019 arguments and evidence. It has underlined, in paragraph 208 of the Resubmission Award, the difficulty to understand the First Award and has regretted, in paragraph 211 of the Resubmission Award, not to be allowed to re-open the debate instead of the First Committee. The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s conclusions were predetermined and driven by the desire to bring the dispute to an end and *\"rendre inefficace l\u2019obligation d\u2019indemniser \u00e9tablie dans la Sentence initiale.\"286* These are manifestations of partiality and bias, *i.e.* a violation of one of the most fundamental duties of arbitral tribunals.287\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 653.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 243-251; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 647-667; Reply on Annulment, paras. 200-234.\n\n418.\n\nFurther, and as an additional demonstration of bias, the Resubmission Tribunal failed to take the Applicants\u2019 evidence into account and give it serious consideration:\n\n*La d\u00e9cision d\u00e9cision du TR d\u2019\u00e9carter les arguments soutenus et les preuves produites par les Demanderesses, puis de consid\u00e9rer que celles-ci n\u2019ont pas satisfait \u00e0 la charge de la preuve qui pesait sur elle n\u2019est que l'aboutissement des autres manifestations du parti pris du Tribunal.288*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 204.\n\n419.\n\nWith respect to the failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n420.\n\nThe Applicants have submitted coherent arguments and a detailed opinion, backed by abundant case law, doctrine and expert advice, on the damage caused by Respondent\u2019s violation of its duty to treat them fairly and equitably. In particular, they have demonstrated that *\"les tribunaux arbitraux ont accept\u00e9 que le principe de r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale implique que l\u2019investisseur puisse \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la valeur de ses biens saisis, quand bien m\u00eame sa demande n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019expropriation mais sur la violation du traitement juste et \u00e9quitable apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l'API le 29 mars 1994.\"289* Even the Respondent\u2019s financial expert admitted that the calculation of damages caused by unfair and unequitable treatment could be based on a fair market value and therefore lead to a quantum *\"equivalent au calcul r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une expropriation.\"290*\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 634.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 190.\n\n421.\n\nIn light of these presentations, the Tribunal\u2019s failure to discuss the evidence presented by the Parties and its simple affirmation that the Applicants have not discharged their burden of proof of their prejudice are *\"incompr\u00e9hensibles,\" \"frivoles\"* et *\"grossi\u00e8rement insuffisants.\"291* As correctly stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *TECO v*. *Guatemala,* it is inadmissible for a tribunal to:\n\n[S]imply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. A tribunal is duty bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.292\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 636-639.\n\n*TECO v. Guatemala,* Decision on Annulment, 5 April 2016, para. 131 (CL-316).\n\n422.\n\nIn violation of its duty, the Tribunal has:\n\n- presented only a *\"r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sommaire\"* of the Applicants\u2019 pleadings;\n\n- completely failed to discuss the Applicants\u2019 arguments and evidence;\n\n- not quoted one of the multiple awards and decisions that the Applicants presented; and\n\n- not at all mentioned the debate between the Applicants and the financial experts, especially with the Respondent\u2019s expert during the hearing.293\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 186-190.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Applicants\u2019 arguments and requests annulment for all three asserted grounds. It submits as follows.\n\n424.\n\nWith respect to facts, arguments and evidence *anterior* to the entry into force of the BIT in 1994, it is simply not true that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers by refusing to hear and consider the Applicants\u2019 arguments and evidence.294 On the contrary, the Tribunal explained that it has \"done its utmost to listen with careful and sympathetic attention to all of the arguments that have been brought before it by the Parties in writing and orally, without seeking to apply in advance any a priori criterion of selection as to which of them would ultimately prove relevant and material to its Award.\"295\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 337-340 (emphasis added).\n\nResubmission Award, para. 171.\n\n425.\n\nIn fact, the Applicants have taken full advantage of the opportunity to present their case \"submitting expert reports and hundreds of exhibits and authorities - many of which addressed the very point that Claimants now say they were prevented from addressing.\"296\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 344.\n\n426.\n\nIt is true that the Tribunal excluded the evidence relating to the Applicants\u2019 expropriation in 1973-1975, as explained in the Award\u2019s paragraphs 217,228 and 230. However, in doing so, the Tribunal has not failed to exercise its jurisdiction or to apply the proper law. Rather, it has respected ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) obliging it not to reconsider any unannulled portion of the award, and in this perspective, the *res iudicata* findings of the First Tribunal. As a result, the Tribunal correctly explained that it had no authority to take such evidence into consideration.\n\n427.\n\nThe First Tribunal held that the expropriation had been completed in 1975, that the provisions of the BIT were not applicable to the expropriation *ratiotie temporis,* that acts having occurred after 1994 could not be taken into account as expropriatory (because the same objects cannot be expropriated twice), and that the violations of the BIT after 1994 -the denial of justice and the compensation of individuals other than Mr. Pey through Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 - were distinct from the expropriation.297 The First Tribunal had reasoned:\n\n*L\u2019expropriation survenue avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e de l\u2019examen du Tribunal arbitral, il en r\u00e9sulte que, pour cette raison d\u00e9j\u00e0, les all\u00e9gations, discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait de l'expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d'\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d'une autre cause, de fait et de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d'un \"traitement juste et \u00e9quitable\"298*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 383-386.\n\nFirst Award, para. 688 (footnotes omitted; emphasis omitted).\n\n428.\n\nEven if these arguments figure in the annulled Chapter VIII of the First Award, they only repeat what the Tribunal had found in the unannulled Chapter VII. The Applicants\u2019 criticism of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the First Award in this respect, and their efforts to replace it by their own vision of what is *res iudicata,* \"is just a direct, unabashed appeal of the Resubmission Award, and thus plainly inappropriate.\"299\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 383.\n\n429.\n\nFinally, the Applicants failed to explain in what way the alleged excess of powers was manifest.300\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 385.\n\n430.\n\nWith respect to facts, arguments and evidence *posterior* to the initial request for arbitration on 3 November 1997, the Applicants have misrepresented the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.\n\n431.\n\nFirst, paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award does not address Article 4 violations that the First Tribunal had found but considers alleged violations occurring after the First Award. Second, it does not exclude any evidence at all. In fact, in paragraph 228(c) of its Award, the Resubmission Tribunal states explicitly that it *\"draws* [this] *conclusion from the above\"* (including paragraph 216) the interpretation of the *res iudicata* part of the First Award leads to the conclusion, opposite to the Applicants\u2019 assertion:\n\n[T]hat there was a breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4, which consisted of the totality of the conduct of the Chilean authorities resulting in the seven-year delay in the Goss press litigation and Decision No. 43, and manifested itself in the award of compensation to persons who were not the owners of the assets confiscated while Mr Pey Casado\u2019s claims were rejected.301\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 372-373; the Respondent quotes para. 228 (c) of the Resubmission Award.\n\n432.\n\nObviously, the Respondent argues, the dates of all the events having caused a violation of the FET obligations are posterior to the request for arbitration and were readily accepted as falling within the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding, thus belying the Applicants\u2019 allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal refused to take facts, arguments and evidence into account that post-date 3 November 1997.\n\n433.\n\nWith respect to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Respondent argues that the Applicants\u2019 allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal discarded relevant evidence without hearing it is belied by the fact that expert reports were submitted and discussed during the evidentiary hearing.\n\n434.\n\nThe Applicants try to curtail the Tribunal\u2019s authority as expressed in ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) according to which the tribunal is the \"judge of the admissibility of any evidence and of its probative value.\"\n\n435.\n\nThe Applicants bore the burden to prove that Chile\u2019s violations of its duty to treat them fairly and equitably (Article 4 as opposed to Article 5 of the BIT) caused injury and quantum. They had ample opportunity to address the issues but have conscientiously failed to do so, for instance by instructing their expert to quantify only the losses caused by the expropriation and not by the distinct denial of justice and further unfair and unequitable treatment.\n\n436.\n\nThe tactical reason behind this was to avoid a calculation of damages based on the 7-years delay of Chilean court proceedings and on the government\u2019s Decision to compensate other people, because such calculation would have led to minimal quanta. However, the strategy *\"had zero chance of succeeding,\"* given that the First Tribunal had determined with *res iudicata* effect that the violations of Articles 4 and 5 were distinct and that the evidence for an expropriation claim was of no use for a FET claim.302\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, paras. 93 ss.\n\n437.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal was bound to follow the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* determination, as it has explained convincingly. In exercising its authority and \"after having evaluated the evidence and arguments of the parties, the Resubmission Tribunal determined that Claimants\u2019 theories were inapposite\" to evidence the causation of damages by FET-standard violations.303\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 387.\n\n438.\n\nAs to the inappropriate allegations of bias, they are based on pure speculation. The Respondent refers to the First Annulment Decision which has rejected a request for annulment based on speculative allegations of bias by accepting the Applicants\u2019 arguments that a committee cannot declare *\"la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence sur un simple apparence de partialit\u00e9,\"* and that *\"l\u2019accusation de partialit\u00e9 du Tribunal ou de ses membres ne doit pas \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur des simples sp\u00e9culations.\"304*\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, paras. 336-337; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 341.\n\n439.\n\nWith respect to the alleged failure to state reasons on which the Award was based, the Resubmission Tribunal has, in paragraphs 198, 217, and 232 of the Award, provided \"ample explanation as to why Claimants\u2019 expropriation-based theories could not be accepted. Claimants very well may disagree with that explanation but [as Schreuer explains] [i]t cannot be expected [...] that reasons must go to such length as to persuade a disgruntled party why it has lost.\"305\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 382 (brackets in original); the Respondent quotes Christoph H.

The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s failure to give** ***res iudicata*** **effect to UNANNULLED FINDINGS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Applicants have asserted three grounds for annulment relating to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to give *res iudicata* effect to unannulled findings:\n\n(a) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n(b) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(c) That the Resubmission Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).307\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 186-252; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 258-583; Reply on Annulment, paras. 53, 125-145.\n\n442.\n\nWith respect to a manifest excess of powers, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n443.\n\nThe Applicants observe that the First Tribunal has determined in paragraphs 627-674, with *res iudicata* effect, that the Respondent violated its duty to afford the Applicants fair and equitable treatment by discriminating against them when it compensated other individuals for the illegal expropriation and not Mr. Pey, and by denying justice through the unreasonable duration of court proceedings. It has summarised its adjudication in paragraph 674 of the Award as follows:\n\n[E]*n r\u00e9sum\u00e9, en accordant des compensations - pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et sont rest\u00e9es inexpliqu\u00e9es - \u00e0 des personnages qui, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal arbitral, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas propri\u00e9taires des biens confisqu\u00e9s, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elle paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqu\u00e9s, la R\u00e9publique du Chili a manifestement commis un d\u00e9ni de justice et refus\u00e9 de traiter les demanderesses de fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable.*\n\nand decided, in paragraph 3 of the *dispositif.*\n\n[L]*es demanderesses ont droit \u00e0 compensation.*\n\n444.\n\nIt follows from there that \"[n]z *l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice ni l\u2019existence d\u2019un dommage corr\u00e9latif ni la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re pour compenser celui-ci ne font le moindre doute pour la Sentence initiale\"308*\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 198, 204, 211, 212 ss.; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 45, 277-292.\n\n445.\n\nThe First Committee upheld this part of the First Award as *res iudicata.309* It decided that *\"la SI* [the First Award] *a correctement tranch\u00e9 que les Demanderesses avaient produit la preuve des faits et des fondement juridiques de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'Etat du Chili pour la violation du trait\u00e9,\"310* as much so as their burden to identify and prove the damage.311\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 359.3.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 117.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 118.\n\n446.\n\nTherefore, the Applicants argue, the role of the Resubmission Tribunal was limited: *\"compte-tenu des violations de TAPI Espagne-Chili par le Chili apr\u00e8s la date du 3 novembre 1997, et du droit \u00e0 compensation reconnu aux Demanderesses, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e de la Sentence initiale, son r\u00f4le \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder aux Demanderesses.\"312*\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 368.\n\n447.\n\nThe limitation was even obvious to outside commentators, as documented by a commentary on the First Annulment Decision by Professor Schreuer who opined:\n\nIn the resubmitted proceedings, initiated in June 2013, the Tribunal will be restricted to determining the amount of damages flowing from the first Tribunal\u2019s finding of liability which is *res judicata313*\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, \"Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v Republic of Chile, Barely an Annulment\", ICSID Review, Vol. 29, No. 2 (2014), pp. 321 ss., 327 (CL-326).\n\n448.\n\nIt is equally incontestable, the Applicants argue, that the First Tribunal determined, with *res iudicata* effect, that *\"les Demanderesses avaient acquis un droit \u00e0 indemnisation de nature p\u00e9cuniaire, et que tel \u00e9tait le sens du terme \u2018compensation\u2019 employ\u00e9 notamment dans le dispositif de la Sentence initiale.\"314* The Tribunal has clearly established *\"que la combinaison des actions et omissions constitutif* [sic] *de la conduite internationalement illicite du Chili \u00e0 partir de 1995, tout au moins pris dans leur ensemble, avaient eu l\u2019effet de bloquer toute possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de redressement, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du syst\u00e8me politico-l\u00e9gal chilien, de la saisie et confiscation ill\u00e9gale et inconstitutionnelle, que ce soit par restitution ou compensation.\"315*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 191; Memorial on Annulment, para. 288.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 218.\n\n449.\n\nThe correct legal base for defining the term \"compensation\" are Articles 31-37 of the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 36, in conjunction with Article 31, leaves no doubt that compensation is the correct remedy for \"any financially assessable damage\" caused by internationally wrongful acts as perpetuated by the Respondent, and not satisfaction, as wrongly decided by the Resubmission Tribunal, since the injury in the present case of a damaged investment can \"be made good by [...] compensation,\" as provided for in Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility.316 Investment disputes are not about the protection of honour but about the violation and reparation of economic interests. Pecuniary compensation is the adequate remedy, as confirmed by ample literature.317\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 194-197; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 406-418.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 299 ss.\n\n450.\n\nAll these *res iudicata* findings of the First Tribunal were final and binding and could not be reconsidered by the Resubmission Tribunal. This is clearly stated in ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) as it is \"an essential and settled rule of international law.\"318\n\n*Trail Smelters Arbitration (United States v. Canada),* Arbitral Tribunal Decision, 35 American Journal of International Law, 1941, pp. 684 ss., 699 (CL-318).\n\n451.\n\nTotally ignoring the finality of the unannulled findings of the First Award, the Resubmission Tribunal reopened the debate and analysis, through four questions asked during the hearing319 related to (i) the Applicants\u2019 investment, (ii) the concept of compensation, (iii) the status of Decree No. 165 and (iv) the meaning of Decision No. 43 and decided the issues anew, under the guise of interpretation.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 293-349.\n\n452.\n\nCertainly, the Applicants argue, arbitral tribunals have a *\"certain pouvoir d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, essentiellement dict\u00e9 par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de comprendre pour appliquer.\"320* However, this power is restricted to an \"interpretative controversy\" and must not be misused to undermine the *res iudicata* effect, in particular where there is no disagreement between the parties on a given issue.321\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 375.\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019). pp. 632-636; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 374-395.\n\n453.\n\nThe Applicants rely on *Amco v. Indonesia (II)* to back their arguments that committees have the right to verify whether an interpretation is reasonable and does not interfere with the *res iudicata* principle. The *ad hoc* committee had found:\n\nIf a new Tribunal reconsiders an issue not annulled, it exceeds its power. [...] Its interpretation could be considered as a manifest excess of powers only if it were manifestly outside any bona fide interpretation of the first committee\u2019s decision and therefore obviously untenable.322\n\n*Amco v. Indonesia (II),* Decision on Annulment, 17 December 1992, para. 8.07 (CL-308) (emphasis omitted).\n\n454.\n\nIn the present case, the Resubmission Tribunal acted in bad faith and has not solved an interpretative controversy but created one by ignoring the agreement of the parties and the unambiguous language of the First Award.\n\n455.\n\nHere, the Applicants assert, the Resubmission Tribunal:\n\n- redefined the concept of compensation against the determination of the First Tribunal and against the clear substance of international law;\n\n- disregarded the Parties\u2019 agreement on the definition of compensation as being necessarily pecuniary;\n\n- refused to accept the First Tribunal\u2019s ascertainment that the Respondent has violated its duty to guarantee fair and equitable treatment and to abstain from denial of justice;\n\n- rejected evidence that the First Tribunal had accepted;\n\n- failed to accept prejudice, causality and damage as proven and has denied the existence of material damage, against the First Tribunal\u2019s findings in the opposite sense;\n\n- refused to determine the quantum of damages in accordance with its limited mandate conferred to it by the First annulment Decision;\n\n- consistently confounded injury, damage and compensation against the clear determination of the First Tribunal as validated by the First Committee; and\n\n- distorted the First Committee\u2019s findings when it declares that the First Committee interpreted the First Tribunal as believing that \"Claimants\u2019 arguments on damages were strictly limited to ones founded on the expropriation\" (Resubmission Award, paragraph 229), where in reality the Committee had only found on a contradiction.323\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 189 ss.. 204, 206. 212-214; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 288, 298-314, 363-365, 397-398, 431-493; Reply on Annulment, paras. 55-63. 125-130, 142-144.\n\n456.\n\nThe Applicants argue that this reasoning and determination by the Resubmission Tribunal is partly an exercise of authority and power that it did not have, partly a rejection of the exercise of power that it did have, and in any event, a failure to apply the applicable law, in sum and excess of power.\n\n457.\n\nThe Applicants assert that the excess is manifest. First, a simple reading of the First Award, the First Annulment Decision, the written submissions of the Parties and the transcript of hearing reveals that the Resubmission Tribunal substituted the *res iudicata* parts of the First Award with its own and disregarded the agreement of the Parties. That is *\"\u00e9vident, flagrant ou discernable sans effort.\"324* Second, the consequences of the excess of powers are particularly serious. It has led the Resubmission Tribunal to deny the existence of injury and damage and has thereby completely annihilated the effect and result of the First Tribunal\u2019s final and binding adjudication.325\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 486-488, 578-581.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 489-492, 582.\n\n458.\n\nWith respect to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants submit that the conduct, arguments and determination presented in the context of the manifest excess of powers document at the same time a consistent bias and partiality in favour of the Respondent.\n\n459.\n\nExamples of bias and partiality are: (1) the wrong definition of the concept of compensation, (2) the confusion between prejudice and quantum, (3) the rejection and misinterpretation of evidence, (4) the distortion of the First Committee\u2019s determination, (5) the disregarding of the agreement of the Parties as to the nature of damage and compensation. By these stratagems, the Resubmission Tribunal tried to wipe out the results of the First Award, as far as it was in favour of the Applicants, has given a reduced and caricatural description of the Applicants\u2019 arguments and has followed the Respondents\u2019 arguments fraudulently and in bad faith.326\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 203, 205, 231, 237; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 296, 320, 331, 338. 361; Reply on Annulment, para. 61(iii).\n\n460.\n\nWith respect to a failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, the Applicants submit as follows.\n\n461.\n\nThe Applicants have detailed their arguments on damages in their written submissions, through expert opinion, and through oral presentation before the Resubmission Tribunal. In particular, they argued coherently that the damage caused by the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard was equivalent to the damage caused by the confiscation of the shares of CPP and EPC in 1973-1975 and had to be calculated to establish the fair market value at that moment.\n\n462.\n\nDespite the *res iudicata* acknowledgment of these damages by the First Tribunal, the Resubmission Tribunal had only given a very superficial summary of these arguments in paragraphs 70-74 of the Award, and set out in paragraph 196 of the Award that the Applicants had pleaded \"a full theory of damages.\"327 This is \"inconsistent with 232, which suggests that they hadn\u2019t even begun to outline such a theory.\"328\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019). p. 647.\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019). pp. 650-651; Reply on Annulment, para. 6l(ii).\n\n463.\n\nFurther, by *\"distortion frauduleuse,\"329* the Resubmission Tribunal simply affirmed that the Applicants had not met the burden to prove \"what injury was caused to either or both of them by the Respondent\u2019s breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding assessable damage in financial terms,\" and that \"in some sense, they have not even tried to do so.\"330\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 231.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 231-232.\n\n464.\n\nIn this way, *\"la Sentence de Resoumission, par la fa\u00e7on dont elle a trait\u00e9, ou plut\u00f4t refus\u00e9 de traiter la th\u00e9orie des Demanderesses concernant la nature de leur pr\u00e9judice et l\u2019\u00e9valuation de celui-ci, s\u2019est donc rendue coupable tant d\u2019un d\u00e9faut de motifs que d'un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste\"331* In fact, it is impossible to understand *\"le cheminement suivi par le tribunal pour parvenir \u00e0 sa conclusion.\"332* It is, the Applicants assert, frivolous, grossly insufficient and inadequate and must therefore be annulled for lack of reasons.333\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 231.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 637.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 227-231; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 631-645; Reply on Annulment, paras. 193-199.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Applicants\u2019 assertions on a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and an absence of reasons on which the Resubmission Award is based and asserts that the annulment request must be rejected.\n\n466.\n\nThe Respondent submits as follows.\n\n467.\n\nAt the outset, it notes that the Applicants have targeted a number of questions that the Resubmission Tribunal asked during the hearing concerning their investments, the nature of compensation, the status of Decree No. 165 and of Decision No. 43. The Applicants argue that through these questions, the Tribunal re-opened the debate on issues already decided *res iudicata.* Since only awards can be annulled and not questions, the Applicants\u2019 arguments are inappropriate and must be rejected summarily.334\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 348-349.\n\n468.\n\nIn addition, the questions were pertinent, concerned issues that had been debated during the proceeding and came as no surprise.335 The Applicants\u2019 allegations that the Tribunal demonstrated partiality and bias each time it sided with the Respondent is groundless, since such allegation requires - as found by the *Tulip v*. *Turkey ad hoc* committee, introduced by the Applicants - \"clear and incontrovertible substantiation,\" which the Applicants have failed to provide.336\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 351-358.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 360.\n\n469.\n\nIn substance, the Resubmission Tribunal has not re-opened any issue that had become final and binding after the First Committee\u2019s Decision, and has respected the *res iudicata* decisions of the First Tribunal.\n\n470.\n\nWith respect to the issues of the exact nature of the remaining investment after the expropriation and of the acknowledgment of the relevance of facts, events, arguments and evidence after the expropriation, the Resubmission Tribunal has accepted the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that the long delay in proceedings before Chilean courts, continuing well after 1997, and the Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 constituted violations of the Article 4 of the BIT, since the First Committee had found \"that the duty to provide redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end,\"337 thereby upholding the First Tribunal\u2019s finding as *res iudicata,* against the argumentation of Chile. These facts bely the Applicants\u2019 allegations that the Resubmission Tribunal disrespected the First Tribunal\u2019s findings on the Applicants\u2019 investments, and that it refused to take facts, events, arguments and evidence that occurred after 1997, into consideration. In reality, the Tribunal rejected only such facts and evidence coming to pass after the First Award.338\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 168.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 370; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 54-61.\n\n471.\n\nFurther, the Applicants\u2019 allegations that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers by disrespecting the First Tribunal\u2019s rex *iudicata* findings on injury, causation and damages are baseless: with respect to injury, the First Tribunal tried nowhere to \"purport to identify any injury **at all \u2014** let alone an injury resulting specifically from the BIT violation that it had found (which the First Tribunal expressly distinguished from an expropriatory act).\"339\n\nRejoinderon Annulment, para. 84 (emphasis in original); Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 376.\n\n472.\n\nWith respect to damages, the First Tribunal had stated that damages resulting from the confiscation did not require any particular analysis340 and that for the alleged damages caused by FET-standard violations the Applicants had failed to adduce any evidence.341 This is the contrary of what the Applicants allege. As a result, the Resubmission Tribunal cannot have exceeded its powers by non-respecting *res iudicata* findings of the First Tribunal, first because the First Tribunal never made such findings, and second because the parts of the First Award that do reveal the First Tribunal\u2019s findings were annulled and have no *res iudicata* effect.342\n\nFirst Award, para. 680.\n\nFirst Award, para. 689.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 375-377; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 84-87.\n\n473.\n\nThe Applicants\u2019 allegation that the First Committee confirmed the First Tribunal\u2019s findings on injury and damages runs equally against its unequivocal statement:\n\nHaving reviewed the entire record, including the parties\u2019 submissions, the Committee can only conclude that the by parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 of the BIT.343\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 262.\n\n474.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Applicants mischaracterize the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s ascertainment on compensation in a vain effort to demonstrate that it exceeded its powers and was biased by disregarding the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* decision on such compensation.\n\n475.\n\nFirst, the Resubmission Tribunal explicitly recognized that the Applicants\u2019 right to compensation had been adjudicated as *res iudicata* in paragraph 3 of the First Award\u2019s *dispositif.* At the same time, it had understood that \"what does remain open for re-litigation at the instance of the Claimants is the nature of the compensation due to them under paragraph 3 in consequence of the breach established in paragraph 2, following the annulment of the assessment made by the First Tribunal in paragraph 4.\"344\n\nResubmission Award, para. 177.\n\n476.\n\nThese two elements of the First Award had to be interpreted *\"to evaluate what these determinations meant in practical terms,\"* which is not - as a matter of principle - contested by the Applicants.345 In accomplishing this exercise:\n\n[T]he Tribunal reads paragraph 3 as stating the entitlement to reparation that necessarily follows from the determination of the breach of an international obligation, but without predetermining what form or nature that reparation must take, except perhaps the non-explicit assumption that in the normal case it may take the form of monetary damages. But it does not read the paragraph as absolving a party claiming monetary damages from its normal obligation to prove such damage, including its causation.346\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 393.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 201.\n\n477.\n\nAs a result, the Resubmission Tribunal confirmed that the Applicants had a right to compensation, as determined by the First Tribunal *res iudicata,* but that at the same time they had a duty to prove what compensation was due as a consequence of the violation of Article 4 of the BIT. The Applicants had ample opportunity to discharge this duty and burden but chose not to do so. The Resubmission Tribunal could not but confirm this failure and conclude that it \"cannot therefore, on principle, make any award of damages.\"347\n\nResubmission Award, para. 234.\n\n478.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal took care to remain within the framework of the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* determination and developed its line of reasoning without internal contradictions by avoiding the repetition of the error of the First Tribunal to \"select a damages figure arbitrarily,\" which had resulted in the partial annulment.348\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 396.\n\n479.\n\nSecond, the Resubmission Tribunal has not substituted the term \"compensation\" by \"satisfaction.\" Rather, after having interpreted the First Award, it noted *en passant* and in addition to its principal conclusion349 that formal recognition of their status as victims of a denial of justice \"constitutes in itself a form of satisfaction under international law.\"350\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 393, 398.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 256(2).\n\n**F. The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the applicable law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nIn paragraphs 253-264 of their Annulment Application and paragraphs 681-691 of their Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants develop their argument that the Resubmission Tribunal has failed to apply the applicable law, in particular the Chilean Constitution but also Chilean court decisions, to appreciate that the confiscation had been invalid and without legal effect and that it had not terminated the ownership of Mr. Pey. These arguments have been dealt with in Section VILA, of this Decision.\n\n481.\n\nIn paragraphs 265-269 of their Annulment Application, the Applicants further submit that the Resubmission Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law when rejecting their claim for moral damages.\n\n482.\n\nThe Applicants refer to ICSID arbitration case law and also to doctrine to assert that it *\"est incontestable que les tribunaux CIRDI ont competence pour accorder des dommages moraux.\"351*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 265.\n\n483.\n\nImmediately thereafter, the Applicants assert that the categorical non-application of Chilean law in the treatment of moral damages by the Tribunal is manifest, whereby it has exceeded its powers.352\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 266; *see also* para. 267 where the Applicants refer to their written submissions before the Resubmission Tribunal: paras. 339 and 340 of their Resubmission Reply of 9 January 2015 (C-40) and para. 164 of their Resubmission Memorial of 27 June 2014 (C-8).\n\n484.\n\nThey arrive at this conclusion because, on the one hand, the Tribunal has not applied the case law of the Chilean Supreme Court that has repeatedly determined that a person having suffered moral damages is exempt from the burden of proving them,353 and that on the other hand, in international law, the power to grant compensation for moral damages does not depend on a prior determination of material injury or damage.354\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 267.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 268.\n\n485.\n\nThe latter argument, they assert, follows directly from the clear formulation in Article 31(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that \"any damage, whether material **or** moral,\" must be compensated.355\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 268 (emphasis in original).\n\n486.\n\nThe Applicants conclude from the foregoing that *\"le paragraphe 243 de la Sentence dans la proc\u00e9dure en annulation doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9 pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste\"356*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 269.\n\n487.\n\nIn paragraphs 270-275 of their Annulment Application, the Applicants submit that the Resubmission Tribunal failed to consider their claim for the restitution of benefits, *i.e.* for unjust enrichment, under international law, although they have introduced it into the Resubmission Proceeding, as documented in paragraph 52 of the Resubmission Award.357\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 271- 272.\n\n488.\n\nThis amounts to a non-application of the applicable law because \"les *Demanderesses faisaient valoir l\u2019enrichissement injuste en tant que doctrine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du droit international\"* and \"[la] *l\u00e9gislation applicable selon l\u2019article 10(4) de l'API Espagne-Chili inclut les principes du droit international.\"*358\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 271.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal was competent under international law to address the issue of permanent violations of secondary obligations resulting from the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It should have ordered the Respondent to disgorge the benefits drawn from the use of the Applicants\u2019 property. However, it misinterpreted the Applicants\u2019 position in this respect:\n\n*Le manquement absolu \u00e0 appliquer la l\u00e9gislation applicable dans ce contexte a amen\u00e9 le 2eme Tribunal \u00e0 une compr\u00e9hension ou \u00e9nonciation erron\u00e9e, dans la section K de sa Sentence, de la r\u00e9clamation des Demanderesses comme constituant une reformulation de la demande selon laquelle la pr\u00e9tendue confiscation initiale \u00e9tait une violation du trait\u00e9, ce qu\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu par le Tribunal initial avec l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019acte en question \u00e9tait hors du domaine temporel du trait\u00e9.359*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 275 (emphasis in original).\n\n490.\n\nThe Applicants request the annulment of Section K of the Award for non-application of the applicable law.360 The Committee assumes that they refer to a manifest excess of powers.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 270.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nThe Respondent has not developed a position with respect to the request for annulment of paragraph 243 (on moral damages) and of Section K (on unjust enrichment) of the Resubmission Award.

The Committee understands this to be a clerical error.\n\nReply on Annulment, title of Section 3.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 20.\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 21-23.\n\n493.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the request does not contain new grounds for annulment but new reasons to support the grounds already asserted in the Annulment Application of 10 October 2017 and the Memorial on Annulment of 27 April 2018. They react to the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment of 20 July 2018. This approach is generally admitted in ICSID proceedings as summarised in *Togo Electricit\u00e9 v*. *Togo,* where the Committee found that *\"la Convention CIRDI n'emp\u00eache pas les parties de soulever de nouveaux arguments \u00e0 l'appui de leur demande en annidation \u00e0 un stade ult\u00e9rieur de la procedure.\"367*\n\n*Togo Electricit\u00e9 and GDF-Suez Energie Services v.

UAE,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, 5 June 2007, para. 33 (CL-305).\n\n494.\n\nThe Applicants contend that they have incurred incidental costs of almost 12 million Euro for actions between 1997 and 2013 to secure and enforce their claims caused by the Respondent\u2019s conduct during and after the initial proceeding and during the proceeding before the First Committee, and that they have brought these claims before the Resubmission Tribunal together with detailed and uncontested documentation, as evidenced by paragraphs 120, 121 and 132 of the Award.368\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 9, 12, 18.\n\n495.\n\nThey submit that these costs must be reimbursed to guarantee *restitutio in integrum,* a principle generally admitted in international law. They rely on a commentary on Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility, which states that it \"is well established that incidental expenses are compensable if they were reasonably incurred,\"369 and on international court and arbitration practice.370\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* Cambridge University Press 2002, Article 36, para. 34 (RL-034).\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 9-10.\n\n496.\n\nThey document the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s line of reasoning371 and assert that it amounts to an absence of reasons, particularly in light of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention which obliges tribunals to state the reasons on which they base their decision:\n\n*Il n\u2019existe dans la SR aucune motivation appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande relative aux dommages cons\u00e9cutifs qui permettrait de comprendre le raisonnement l\u2019ayant port\u00e9 \u00e0 refuser, au 8eme point du Dispositif, la restitution des presque douze millions d\u2019euros de dommages cons\u00e9cutifs que les Demanderesses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9es d\u2019engager dans la d\u00e9fense de leur investissement durant les dix-huit ann\u00e9es \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leur Requ\u00eate initiale d\u2019arbitrage, le 3 novembre 1997, et celle de la fin de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e du point 5 du Dispositif de la Sentence initiale, le 2 novembre 2015*.372\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 17.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 18 (footnotes omitted).\n\n497.\n\nAs to the assertion of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants write:\n\n*D\u2019autre part, la SR a rejet\u00e9 cette demande sans avoir en aucune fa\u00e7on pris en consid\u00e9ration les pi\u00e8ces justificatives, incontest\u00e9es, du montant des dommages caus\u00e9s aux Demanderesses, ce qui constitue un manquement \u00e0 une r\u00e9partition appropri\u00e9e de la charge de la preuve et une manifestation de partialit\u00e9 grave de la part du TR sanctionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 51(1)(d) la Convention.373*\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 20.\n\n498.\n\nThe Applicants do not go further in their arguments.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Applicants\u2019 arguments and request for procedural and substantial reasons in paragraphs 115-122 of its Rejoinder on Annulment with the following arguments.\n\n500.\n\nFirst, it asserts that the First Tribunal and the First Annulment Committee made a final determination on costs of the different procedural phases and that these decisions are *res iudicata.374*\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 116.\n\n501.\n\nSecond, the Applicants misrepresent the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* determination when they allege a violation of Article 3 of the BIT and Articles 53(1) and 54(1) of the ICSID Convention. Neither the Committee nor the First Tribunal have found on such violations.375\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 116.\n\n502.\n\nThird, the Applicants\u2019 request concern new claims. They were introduced more than two years after the Award, a very long time after the 120 days, provided for in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.376\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 118.\n\n503.\n\nFourth, it is inaccurate that the Resubmission Tribunal has not stated reasons for its decision not to grant prior costs claims. It has stated that its role was limited and it was not authorised to re-open *res iudicata* determinations such as the ones on costs, that in any event the Tribunal had explicitly stated - in footnotes 355 and 358 - that the decision on costs was not material to the Resubmission Proceeding and would not be re-considered, and that it could not make any award on damages.377\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 119.\n\n504.\n\nFifth, it is obvious that the Tribunal lacked the authority to overturn the costs decision already rendered by the First Tribunal and the First Committee, and tribunals are not held \"to explain self-evident truths.\"378 The Respondent relies on Professor Schreuer, who states that an award \"will not be annulled if the reasons for a decision, though not stated, are readily apparent to the *ad hoc* committee.\"379\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 120.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention -A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, para. 362 (RALA-0006).\n\n505.\n\nSixth and in particular with regard to the allegation that there was a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants presented only two totally insufficient assertions, which do not refer to a procedural rule, let alone a fundamental one, which do not demonstrate how the Tribunal departed from a rule, and which do not explain in what way the alleged departure was serious.380\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 121.\n\n**H.

They assert that the Resubmission Tribunal committed a series of annullable errors when it decided that she had no *ius standi* as a party in interest although being an investor, and that she was the representative of the Applicants instead.\n\nTr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), pp. 109-118.\n\n507.\n\nThey request, in paragraph 753 of the Memorial on Annulment, that the Committee annul the first paragraph of the *dispositif* and paragraphs 187-188 of the Resubmission Award for manifest excess of powers. They also request, in paragraph 250 of the Reply on Annulment, the annulment on the basis of the additional grounds of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and an absence of reasons. Furthermore, they request, in paragraph 251 of the Reply on Annulment, that the Committee annul the whole Award for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (partiality).\n\n508.\n\nThey recall that Mr. Pey Casado remains a party to the proceeding being represented by his counsel Dr. Garc\u00e9s and that it is an excess of powers and a failure to state reasons to replace Dr. Garc\u00e9s and impose Ms. Pey Grebe as new counsel against the will of all parties involved.382\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 701-704; Reply on Annulment, paras. 236-238.\n\n509.\n\nThey further recall that Mr. Pey Casado had assigned his *\"actions, titres, droits et cr\u00e9ances\"* by notarial deed of 15 March 2013 to his daughter Ms. Pey Grebe and that she substituted her father in the ongoing ICSID proceeding by agreeing in the deed that *\"elle se subroge au lieu et place du CEDANT pour ce qui concerne dudit arbitrage aupr\u00e8s du CIRDI [...] conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce que dispose l\u2019article cinquante-deux (six) de la Convention CI RDI\".*383\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 248, citing the notarial deed (C-264) (emphasis omitted); Memorial on Annulment, para. 705.\n\n510.\n\nTherefore, she had become an investor in CPP S.A. in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, not differently from the Co-Applicant Foundation President Allende,384 to whom Mr. Pey Casado had assigned part of his shares on 27 April 1990.385\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 733-736; Reply on Annulment, paras. 238, 248.\n\nFirst Award, para. 538.\n\n511.\n\nIn her quality as assignee, she had become a successor and a party to the proceeding, again no different from the Co-Applicant Foundation President Allende, given that the assignment was valid without government approval, that she had double nationality, like her father, and that the issue of nationality was finally settled with the registration of the original proceeding.386 The Applicants rely on Professor Hanotiau who states that \"[p]ersons others than formal signatories may be parties to the arbitration agreement [...] [such as] assignees.\"387\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 720, 723-731, 740 ss.; Reply on Annulment, paras. 246-252.\n\nBernard Hanotiau, \"Who are the Parties to the Contract(s) or to the Arbitration Clause(s)...?\", in *Complex Arbitration: Multiparty, Multicontract, Multi-Issue and Class Actions.* Kluwer Law International 2006. para. 12 (CL-371).\n\n512.\n\nThe First Tribunal recognised formally and with *res iudicata* effect that Mr. Pey Casado has *ius standi* before the ICSID tribunal as an investor and owner, as confirmed by the First Committee, and that this recognition applies to Ms. Pey Grebe as his successor, as much so as the *res iudicata* determination on the *ius standi* of the Foundation and on the nationality of Mr. Pey Casado apply *mutatis mutandis* to her.388\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 712, 740, 749, 723 ss.; Reply on Annulment, paras. 241-247.\n\n513.\n\nUnder these circumstances of established facts and law, the Resubmission Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers:\n\n- when it denied Ms. Pey Grebe her status as investor, successor and thereby her quality as a party of the proceeding, in identity with her predecessor;389\n\n- when it re-opened the issue of her nationality;390\n\n- when it disrespected the First Tribunal\u2019s final determination of the quality of the Foundation as investor and did not apply it to her;391\n\n- when it refused to recognize the identity of the Parties to the initial proceedings thus excluding Ms. Pey Grebe from accessing international arbitration and leaving her in a *\"legal limbo\"* ;392 and\n\n- when it imposed Ms. Pey Grebe as new representative in the proceeding, in replacement of Dr. Garc\u00e9s.393\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 726 ss., 737 ss.. 753; Reply on Annulment, para. 240. *See also* Reply on Annulment, para. 242.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 739 ss., 753.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 740 ss., 753; Reply on Annulment, paras. 244-248.\n\nTr.

It presents the following arguments.\n\n517.\n\nFirst, the Applicants missed the deadline of 120 days for the introduction of a new annulment claim, as established in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(1)(c), without an excuse.399\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 365-366; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 67-68.\n\n518.\n\nSecond, the Applicants failed to substantiate in what way an alleged excess of powers was obvious and serious, what fundamental procedural rule the Tribunal departed from, and in what way the alleged departure was serious, and how reasons were lacking or contradictory.400\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 367; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 65, 66, 69-74, 78, 81.\n\n519.\n\nThird, the Applicants try to establish that the Tribunal was wrong in its determination, which amounts to an inadmissible appeal of the Award.401\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 367.\n\n520.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions and reasoning as to the status of the Claimants of the dispute and the inadmissibility of admitting a new claimant are convincing, in line with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which requires the identity of the parties throughout the proceeding, and in any event \"tenable.\" Further, the Tribunal stated the reasons on which it has based its decision. The fact that the reasoning was succinct does not deprive it of its existence.402 Further, the reasoning on the internal distribution of a hypothetical compensation did not contradict the Tribunal\u2019s final rejection of financial compensation, since the Tribunal exposed its thoughts clearly in the conditional.403\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 368; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 63, 71-74.\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 79-80.\n\n521.\n\nFifth, the Applicants misrepresent the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the status of Ms. Pey Grebe as representative of Mr. Pey Casado. The Tribunal never stated that it would consider her to be new counsel in the proceeding and continued to address Dr. Garc\u00e9s as such but tried to give her a status under substantive law.404\n\nReply on Annulment, paras. 79-80.\n\n**I. The finding on costs in the Rectification Decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nIn paragraphs 276-280 of the Annulment Application and in paragraphs 754-757 of the Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants request the annulment of paragraphs 58, 61 and 62(b) of the Decision on Rectification of the Award, dated 6 October 2017. The request to also annul paragraph 7 of the *dispositif* of the Resubmission Award,405 was withdrawn during the hearing.406\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 757.\n\nTr. Day 3 (14 March 2019), pp. 652-653.\n\n523.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the Tribunal condemned them to pay the totality of the costs of the rectification proceeding, although they only lost the requests for the disqualification of arbitrators but had successfully challenged the errors in the Award, which the Tribunal was obliged to recognize and correct.407\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 276.\n\n524.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision on the allocation of costs contradicts arbitral practice, where success in a dispute is normally taken into account by tribunals in their decisions to allocate costs including by one in which arbitrator Veeder sat and in which he had decided to split the costs after an equilibrated rectification decision.408 It also contradicts the Tribunal\u2019s own determination in paragraphs 249-251 of the Resubmission Award.409\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 277; Memorial on Annulment, para. 755.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 279.\n\n525.\n\nThe Applicants allege a *\"partialit\u00e9 \u00e9vidente [...] et le caract\u00e8re arbitraire\"* of the Tribunal and ask the Committee that it annuls *\"dans sa totalit\u00e9 les \u00a7\u00a758, 61 et 62(b) de la D\u00e9cision du 6 octobre 2017, pour les motifs \u00e9tablis \u00e0 l\u2019article 52(1) de la Convention, lettres (b), (d) et (e).\"410* In paragraph 757 of the Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants also allege an *\"inobservance grave d\u2019une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de proc\u00e9dure, un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir manifeste et absence de motif.\"411*\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 280.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 757.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Applicants have not articulated any of the grounds for annulment \"in sufficient detail to be intelligible\" and failed to address their various elements.412\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 409.\n\n527.\n\nFurther, the fact that one member of the Tribunal was arbitrator in a different proceeding where the tribunal had come to a different result is irrelevant for the present case.413\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 410-411.\n\n528.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that it is not true that the Applicants prevailed in their rectification requests. Indeed, \"Chile had in fact agreed that certain rectifications were needed\" and made proposals in that sense that were accepted by the Tribunal with one exception.414\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 412.\n\n529.\n\nFinally, it submits that the Applicants had used a \"vexatious litigation strategy during the Rectification Proceeding\" and had abused it as a vehicle to challenge arbitrators Sir Berman and Mr. Veeder. This approach hindered an efficient and economical conduct of the proceeding. It was appropriate that under the circumstances the Tribunal decided to order the Applicants to pay the totality of the costs.415\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 412.\n\n**VIII. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS ON THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Appointment of Mr. Alexis Mourre and the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s APPROACH TO THE APPLICANTS\u2019 REQUESTS FOR HIS REMOVAL**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Applicants formulated their objections to the constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal with respect to Mr. Mourre when the Secretariat invited the Parties to appoint arbitrators. Therefore, their objections were timely, and this timeliness extends to the initiation of the present annulment proceeding, which was only possible after the rendering of the Resubmission Award. However, this request for annulment must be rejected for the following reasons.\n\n**(1) Improper constitution of the tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nConsent and the autonomy of the parties are essential elements of the ICSID system. Parties are in control of the proceedings. One of the fundamental expressions of autonomy relates to the constitution of tribunals. The autonomy is exercised by either agreeing on the method of appointment of arbitrators or by appointing one of them individually, as laid down in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Since the right is fundamental, the ICSID Convention provides only for default mechanisms under specific circumstances.\n\n532.\n\nThese general considerations apply also for resubmission proceedings, as reflected in Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d).\n\n533.\n\nArticle 52(6) provides that \"the dispute shall [...] be submitted to a new tribunal [...].\" The terms are unambiguous. As the Applicants rightly point out, when an award is annulled, it is no longer final and the proceeding starts afresh. The dispute continues but the proceeding is in the hands of a new adjudicating body. The resubmission tribunal has no link to the previous adjudicating body and is not a successor. Therefore, the Applicants are not correct when they assume that the newly appointed arbitrators \"take the place\" of the arbitrators of preceding phases of the dispute.\n\n534.\n\nArticle 52(6) further provides that the new tribunal shall be \"constituted in accordance with Section 2\" of Chapter IV, in other words with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention. Whenever the drafters of the ICSID Convention refer to other provisions and their *mutatis mutandis* application, they do it with precision, as is the case in Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee has no doubt that the reference to Articles 37 to 40 is meant to exclude the applicability of other Articles for the constitution of the new tribunal.\n\n535.\n\nIn particular, the reference to Section 2 of Chapter IV unambiguously excludes a reference to Chapter V and more specifically to the powers of the Chairman pursuant to Article 56(3).\n\n536.\n\nThat does not mean that Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention is inapplicable in resubmission proceedings. It would be applicable if and to the extent that its requirements are met. If one of the arbitrators resigns in the course of resubmission proceedings, the Chairman has the duty to appoint a replacement. In the present case, however, the situation is the opposite: the arbitrator whom the Applicants seek to replace through appointment of the Chairman explicitly declared that he did not wish to resign.\n\n537.\n\nIn addition, Article 56(3) on its own terms also precludes its application to the constitution of a resubmission tribunal as a mere consequence of the fact that the Article was applied to the first tribunal. Article 56(3) provides that if an arbitrator appointed by a party \"shall have resigned without the consent of the Tribunal of which he was a member,\" the Chairman shall appoint a person from the Panel \"to fill the resulting vacancy.\" These terms clearly limit the scope of application to the recomposition of the same tribunal.\n\n538.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) implements Article 52(6). Pursuant to that provision, the Secretariat shall \"invite the parties to proceed [...] to constitute a new Tribunal, including the same number of arbitrators, and appointed by the same method, as the original one.\" Again, since the new tribunal is not a continuation of the old one, the method to be used to constitute the resubmission tribunal is the method used to constitute the first tribunal. ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) cannot provide differently given the clear terms of Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention which it implements.\n\n539.\n\nThe Applicants assert that the reference to the \"original one\" *(\"Tribunal initial\"* in French) in ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) does not point to the tribunal as originally constituted but rather to the one that rendered the award. According to the Applicants, this interpretation is necessary to give effect to the applicability of Article 56(3), a crucial norm for the propriety of arbitral proceedings and the continuous sanction of improper conduct of one party.\n\n540.\n\nHowever, contrary to what the Applicants assert, the terms \"original,\" *\"initial\"* and \"tribunal which rendered the award\" are not used interchangeably in the ICSID Convention and the Rules. It is true that the same formula, \"the original one.\" is used in both ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(3) for interpretation and revision, and in ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) for annulment proceedings. However, this argument finds no basis in the Convention, which prevails over the Rules. On the two occasions when the Convention refers to the \"tribunal which has rendered the award,\" *i.e.* in Article 50(2) for interpretation and in Article 51(3) for revision, it does so because that very tribunal is most familiar with the award and therefore most competent to interpret it or to determine whether subsequent unknown facts were discovered warranting a revision. This is substantially different from resubmission proceedings where a case must, in whole or in part, be decided anew.\n\n541.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) also requires the Secretariat to \"invite the parties to proceed [...] to constitute a new Tribunal\" and not \"the parties or the Chairman, if he appointed one of the members of the first tribunal pursuant to Article 56(3) of the Convention\" - which would have been the appropriate formula further to the Applicants\u2019 position.\n\n542.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Applicants that Article 56(3) has an important function for the efficiency and the propriety of the proceeding. There are, however, several reasons why this function could not be activated by an \"analogous application\" for the purpose of the constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal.\n\n543.\n\nFirst, the Applicants\u2019 thesis is contradicted by the clear and self-sufficient terms of *both* Articles 52(6) and 56(3) that leave no room for an \"analogous application.\"\n\n544.\n\nSecond, the Applicants\u2019 thesis finds no support in the context, or in the object and purpose of the relevant provisions.\n\n545.\n\nThe object and purpose of Article 52(6) is to provide for the constitution of a *new* tribunal. Under the ICSID Convention, the principle is that the constitution of arbitral tribunals is in the hands of the parties, in accordance with the principle of autonomy (Article 37 of the ICSID Convention). The appointment of arbitrators by the Chairman is the default rule (Article 38 of the ICSID Convention). Accordingly, the object and purpose of Article 52(6) and its context contradict the Applicants\u2019 thesis.\n\n546.\n\nThe same is true of the object and purpose of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention together with its context. When it comes to constituting a resubmission tribunal, the functions and purposes of Article 56(3) are either not at issue or achieved through other means. According to the sources relied upon by the Applicants,416 such functions are threefold:\n\n- A first function of Article 56(3) is to safeguard the immutability of the composition of tribunals. This function is not at issue since the resubmission tribunal is constituted anew and by definition, none of its members have resigned without the other arbitrators\u2019 consent.\n\n- A second possible function of Article 56(3) is to prevent a party, in the course of the proceedings, from inducing the arbitrator which it appointed to resign so as to replace her or him with \"a more tractable\" one. This function is not at issue either when it comes to the constitution of a resubmission tribunal. There is no basis for a party to be dissatisfied with the performance of its party-appointed arbitrator and try to have her or him removed before the resubmission proceedings even started. At that initial stage, each party seeks to make the best appointment, and each arbitrator declares that she or he is independent and impartial. Each arbitrator is presumed to be so unless she or he is challenged pursuant to the relevant provisions.\n\n- A third function of Article 56(3) consists in preventing a party from delaying proceedings by causing the arbirator it appointed to resign and then postponing the appointment of a replacement arbitrator. Where the constitution of a resubmission tribunal is at stake, this function is achieved through other means. If a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 90 days, the power to appoint *in lieu* of that party rests with the Chairman pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention upon the request of one of the parties.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 58 ss., referring among others to Mr. Broches, Professor Schreuer and a note from the Secretariat.\n\n547.\n\nIn conclusion, the provisions dealing with the constitution of the resubmission tribunal in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules are straightforward, consistent, coherent and complete. The Committee does not see a gap which might justify an analogous application of the basic idea of a norm which is not applicable through interpretation in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT. The non-application of Article 56(3) does not lead to a situation where the interpretation, pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, leaves the meaning of Articles 52(6) and 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention \"ambiguous or obscure\" or leading to \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\" results (Article 32 of the VCLT).\n\n548.\n\nIn addition, in the first phase of the present proceeding, the Chairman had appointed a specific arbitrator to replace another specific arbitrator. Nothing in this decision indicates that - assuming this is within the powers of the Chairman - it was meant to pronounce a sanction against Chile for wrongdoings in connection with its party-appointed arbitrator\u2019s divulgation of the First Tribunal\u2019s deliberation,417 and that the Chairman sought to establish his power to appoint arbitrators instead of Chile for the remainder of the proceeding.\n\n*Supra,* para. 306.\n\n549.\n\nIt may be added that the fears which, according to the Applicants\u2019 thesis, would justify an \"analogical application\" of Article 52(6) did not materialize. Chile did not seek to delay the proceedings by postponing the appointment of an arbitrator, quite the opposite. The appointment of Mr. Mourre was made promptly, and in appointing Mr. Mourre, Chile did not choose an arbitrator \"more tractable\" than other arbitrators before him, since the Applicants expressly confirmed that the personal qualities of Mr. Mourre were not in question and that they had no reason to challenge him.\n\n550.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee determines that the appointment of Mr. Mourre by Chile complied with Articles 52(6) and 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and the constitution of the Tribunal was proper. The Applicants\u2019 request for annulment based on Article 52(1)(a) with respect to Mr. Mourre is therefore rejected.\n\n551.\n\nThe determination on the proper constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal is not without effect on the other alleged grounds for annulment, *i.e.,* a manifest excess of power and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, allegedly exercised by the Tribunal but also by the Centre.\n\n**(2) Manifest excess of power**\n--------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe Committee understands that the Applicants are asserting that the Centre and the Resubmission Tribunal have exceeded their powers, first by disrespecting the binding conclusions of the First Tribunal, and second by accepting the appointment of Mr. Mourre.\n\n553.\n\nThe Committee has studied the First Award carefully. It has not found a binding decision or even a statement to the effect that in potential resubmission phases, Chile would be precluded from appointing an arbitrator. Paragraphs 34-37 and 729 describe violations of the deontological duties of individual arbitrators and incidents which are incompatible with the practice of international arbitration but they do not envisage procedural steps in future phases of the dispute. The First Tribunal found that the resigning arbitrator had violated his deontological duties but considered that it was not within its power to inquire whether Chile had taken any initiative in this sense.418 Therefore, the Centre did not violate a *res iudicata* effect when it monitored the procedure of constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d), and the Resubmission Tribunal did not violate such effect by accepting its constitution of that Tribunal in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nFirst Award, paras. 36-37.\n\n554.\n\nFurther, neither the Centre nor the Resubmission Tribunal violated Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention when the Resubmission Tribunal held, during the controversial debates surrounding the drafting of Procedural Order No. 1 in 2013/2014, that it was properly constituted and competent to adjudicate the matters before it. The Resubmission Tribunal did what Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention requests it to do, namely it ruled on its competence to decide on the Claimants\u2019 request regarding the role of Mr. Mourre in the Resubmission Tribunal.\n\n555.\n\nFinally, neither the Centre nor the Resubmission Tribunal violated the duty established in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention. A violation of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention would require that a gap in procedural rules existed which had to be filled by the Tribunal\u2019s decision. However, no such gap exists in situations where an arbitrator is appointed in accordance with the procedural rules. There was no legal basis for the two other arbitrators to ask Mr. Mourre to resign, and there was no legal basis to ask the Chairman to appoint an arbitrator. Accordingly, the Centre acted in compliance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules when monitoring the constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d).\n\n556.\n\nTherefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Resubmission Award for an excess of power in the context of the appointment of Mr. Mourre.\n\n**(3) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nWith respect to an alleged departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, neither the Resubmission Tribunal - nor indeed the Centre - violated a rule of procedure by refusing to take action, at the request of the Applicants, to invite Mr. Mourre to resign, holding that it was not called to do so without a formal request for disqualification which the Applicants refused to submit.\n\n558.\n\nMembers of tribunals have no authority to take action against a co-arbitrator *sua sponte.* An initiation by one of the parties is required. The Committee does not subscribe to the Applicants\u2019 argument according to which a request for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention was \"inapplicable\" since their refusal to accept the appointment of Mr. Mourre was not based on any of his personal qualities. As the Respondent observes, Article 57 of the ICSID Convention not only allows for the examination of an arbitrator\u2019s personal qualities but also allows for the determination of whether the arbitrator was \"eligible for appointment\" pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention. While these Articles do not comprise the hypothesis envisaged by the Applicants, this is inherent in the fact that they were seeking an analogous application of provisions of the ICSID Convention. It was for the Applicants to act in a coherent manner on the basis of their position as to an analogous application of Article 56(3). Accordingly, it was for the Applicants to challenge Mr. Mourre by means of an application to disqualify him on the basis of the (analogous) application of Article 57. Absent any such request, the Resubmission Tribunal was not in a position to act. The Centre was in even less of a position to act.\n\n559.\n\nTherefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Resubmission Award for a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure in the context of the appointment of Mr. Mourre.\n\n560.\n\nThat leads to the overall result that all requests for annulment in the context of the appointment of Mr. Mourre as arbitrator of the Resubmission Tribunal are rejected.\n\n**B. The Challenges to Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. V.V. Veeder; their alleged manifest lack of impartiality; their alleged failure to disclose information, investigate relevant facts and order the production of documents to Chile; their alleged conduct following the second Challenge**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) General observations: the Committee\u2019s powers**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee has the authority and duty to determine, (i) whether the Resubmission Tribunal was properly constituted, (ii) whether, once constituted, it manifestly exceeded its powers and/or seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and, (iii) whether the Resubmission Tribunal stated the reasons on which it based the Resubmission Award. Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention unambiguously states that a party may only request the annulment of an \"award.\" A rectification decision is no exception and is annullable because it is \"part of the award\" (Article 49(2)).\n\n562.\n\nThis Committee does not have the authority and duty to assess the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s conduct to the extent that it has not had an impact on the Resubmission Award. That is the case for post-Award conduct, as long as such conduct does not evidence errors of the pre-Award phase, reflecting a pattern or *modus operandi* of continuous behaviour.\n\n563.\n\nThe Committee does also not have the authority and duty to assess whether decisions or opinions by individual arbitrators, expressed in letters or otherwise, state the reasons on which they are based. Article 52(1)(e) unequivocally states that an award can only be annulled when the tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the *award* is based. It does not allow for the annulment of an award because the tribunal or a member of the tribunal did not state the reasons on which procedural decisions outside the award, and even more so post-award procedural decisions are based.\n\n564.\n\nFurther, *ad hoc* committees cannot, in principle, address the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator *de novo* in disregard of the proceedings that have taken place pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention. They may only address the issue *de novo* if the decision taken pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have reached it. This is the approach taken in *EDF v. Argentina* and *Suez v*. *Argentina419* The same position was taken by the *ad hoc* committee in *Mobil v. Argentina420* As the Respondent argues, the *Mobil* committee expressly adhered to the two abovementioned decisions.421 While the Applicants correctly observe that the *Mobil* decision recognized further powers of annulment committees,422 this was to the effect that annulment committees can evaluate an arbitral tribunal\u2019s impartiality on the basis of the decisions taken by the tribunal (or by the majority of the arbitrators) regarding a challenge brought against one of them.423 The Committee agrees with the *Mobil* committee in this respect and will proceed accordingly, but observes that this is not concerned with the circumstances under which an annulment committee can address *de novo* a challenge decided upon by the Chairman, rather than by the remaining arbitrators.\n\n*EDF v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016, para. 145 (C-103). *See also* *Suez v*. *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 5 May 2017, paras. 188-189 (C-109).\n\n*Mobil v. Argentina,* Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for Annulment, 8 May 2019, para. 44.\n\nChile\u2019s submission regarding *Mobil v. Argentina* decision, 1 July 2019, pp. 1-2.\n\nApplicants\u2019 Response to the *ad hoc Committee,* 1 July 2019, p. 2.\n\n*Op. cit.,* paras. 44-46.\n\n565.\n\nFor these reasons, a first series of acts which the Committee will not analyse from the perspective of their possible annulment, is the following:\n\n- the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 21 November 2016 to reject a request for disclosure of documents;\n\n- President Berman\u2019s letter of 1 March 2017 announcing his intention not to participate in Mr. Veeder\u2019s disqualification procedure; and\n\n- the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 15 June 2017 not to order Chile to provide information on its relation with Essex Court Chambers.\n\nThese acts are not annullable *per se.* However, they will be analysed by the Committee so as to determine whether their possible deficiencies impact on the Resubmission Award so as to justify its annulment.\n\n566.\n\nA second series of acts which the Committee will not analyse from the perspective of their possible annulment consists of the two decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council on the proposals to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder, dated 21 February 2017 and 13 April 2017. This Committee will analyse only the decisions of the Chairman so as to determine whether they hinder or, to the contrary, call for a *de novo* examination of whether the Tribunal was properly constituted.\n\n**(2) President Berman\u2019s letter of 1 March 2017: no pattern of pre-award conduct**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nIn that context, the Committee wishes to underline the following point from the outset. It does not consider that President Berman\u2019s position, expressed in his letter of 1 March 2017, evidences a pattern of pre-award conduct on his part.\n\n568.\n\nWith respect to the letter of 1 March 2017, the Applicants note that President Berman referred the challenge against Mr. Veeder to the Chairman of the Administrative Council because he regarded the challenge as an \"appeal\" against the Chairman\u2019s previous decision on the challenge brought against Mr. Veeder and himself. The Applicants assert that President Berman thereby disregarded the fact that the new challenge was based on new evidence, which allegedly proves a lack of impartiality on his part.\n\n569.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that President Berman\u2019s letter of 1 March 2017 proves a lack of impartiality. Qualifying the new challenge against Mr. Veeder as \"not dissimilar to an appeal,\" as President Berman did, may not have been entirely adequate. However, since a first challenge against Mr. Veeder had been decided upon by the Chairman, and since the Applicants (as they themselves underline) were now alleging new facts, which were related to the facts previously submitted to the Chairman, the nature of the new challenge was a request for the revision of the Chairman\u2019s previous decision. Requests for revision are generally handled by the entity that rendered the original decision subject to which revision is sought, as evidenced by Article 51 of the ICSID Convention. Against this background, President Berman\u2019s position does not constitute a refusal to admit that the Applicants were adducing new evidence. It cannot be qualified as unreasonable or interpreted as evidencing a lack of impartiality to the detriment of the Applicants.\n\n570.\n\nPresident Berman\u2019s further comment that if he were to sit on the new challenge against Mr. Veeder, he would be open to the accusation that he (President Berman) lacked the necessary impartiality because he had just been challenged by the Applicants or because both the previous and the new challenge were concerned with the relationship between members of the same barristers\u2019 chambers, obviously sought to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings and more specifically the Applicants\u2019 rights and interests in that respect. This behaviour is the opposite of behaviour evidencing partiality to the detriment of the Applicants.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s decisions of 21 November 2016 and 15 June 2017: no pre-award knowledge of the allegedly relevant facts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nWith respect to the refusal to investigate the relationship between Essex Court Chambers and Chile, President Berman and Mr. Veeder, and, for that matter, the Applicants themselves, declared that before the date of the Resubmission Award they did not know that members of Essex Court Chambers had worked as counsel for and against Chile and had been paid for these services. The Applicants allege that President Berman and Mr. Veeder were not truthful in this respect and Chile alleges that it is the Applicants that were not truthful in this respect.\n\n572.\n\nNeither Party has proffered evidence for these allegations. The Committee has no reason to doubt the sincerity of the affirmations of President Berman, Mr. Veeder and the Applicants. It bases the reasoning of this Decision on Annulment on the assumption that none of them lied and none of them had knowledge about the relations between other members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile. The Committee further notes that neither the relations nor the fees paid by Chile were contested when the issue was raised after the Award had been rendered.\n\n573.\n\nThis observation leads to an unavoidable conclusion, similar to the one made in *Vivendi II* under comparable circumstances. That *ad hoc* committee found that the challenged arbitrator had no actual knowledge of circumstances which might have caused a party to doubt about the \"reliability for independent judgment\" (Article 14 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 6). Therefore, the incriminated circumstances \"had no material effect on the final decision of the Tribunal.\"424\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina (II),* Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for Annulment of the Award Rendered on 20 August 2017, 10 August 2010, para. 235 (C-107).\n\n574.\n\nSince neither President Berman nor Mr. Veeder had positive knowledge of relations between members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile at the time the Award was rendered, that knowledge could not impair their judgment with respect to the Award. Later knowledge does not reflect back to the time before the Award. It is therefore irrelevant whether the knowledge had any impact on the incriminated decisions of 21 November 2106 and 15 June 2017. The Convention is only concerned with the absence of bias affecting awards as the outcome of the arbitration process and not with subsequent conduct.\n\n**(4) The institutional propriety of the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 13 April 2017**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nThe Applicants assert that the Decision of 13 April 2017 by which the Chairman rejected the proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder was made by the wrong body. Therefore, the Decision must be disregarded and the Committee must adjudicate the issue of disqualification anew.\n\n576.\n\nMore precisely, the Applicants assert that President Berman had no right to refuse to decide on the proposal, together with the second arbitrator, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. They rely on *Azurix v. Argentina* where the *ad hoc* committee had found:\n\nThus, for instance, a ground of annulment might exist under Article 52(1)(a) [...] if a decision on a proposal for disqualification was purportedly taken by a person or body other than the person or body prescribed by Article 58.425\n\n*Azurix v. Argentina.* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 (\"*Azurix v. Argentina\"),* Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic. 1 September 2009. para. 282 (C-69).\n\n577.\n\nHowever, as already mentioned, the Applicants\u2019 new challenge against Mr. Veeder was in fact a request for revision of the Chairman\u2019s previous decision on the challenge brought against President Berman and Mr. Veeder. In accordance with a general principle of procedural law, as evidenced by Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, requests for revision should, if possible, be brought before the organ which rendered the original decision. As a consequence, there is no basis to consider that the decision on the new challenge against Mr. Veeder was made by a person or body lacking the necessary authority.\n\n578.\n\nAnother consequence is that the Applicants\u2019 assertion that the decision-making process violated the principle of the international *ordre public* that *\"un arbitre* [ne peut] *s'abstenir dans l'accomplissement de l'obligation que la premi\u00e8re phase de l'article 58 lui impose tout en demeurant en fonction\"426* is of no avail. The question is whether the Chairman was authorised to make the Decision and not whether President Berman was under the obligation to decide the challenge in the circumstances of the case. That is not an issue of *ordre public* but of the mechanics of the ICSID system.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 172.\n\n579.\n\nIn addition, the Applicants\u2019 argument that President Berman should have either heard the challenge against Mr. Veeder or resigned is not consistent with the solution that the ICSID system provides, as President Berman declined to hear the challenge. From this perspective, the issue before this Committee is not to decide whether President Berman was entitled to refuse to participate in the procedure but rather whether the Chairman acted correctly when he decided in the arbitrators\u2019 stead.\n\n580.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Convention does not specifically address the situation when one of the remaining arbitrators declines (or for that matter, both arbitrators decline) to take part in the challenge procedure. However, Article 58 addresses a series of hypotheses where the decision shall be made by the Chairman, namely \"where those [remaining] members are equally divided, or in the case of a proposal to disqualify a sole [...] arbitrator, or a majority of [...] arbitrators.\" These hypotheses taken together make it clear that when the decision cannot be made by consensus between the two remaining arbitrators, it is for the Chairman to decide. This solution is also bound to apply where one or both of the remaining arbitrators, decline to make a decision. This has the consequence that the remaining arbitrators do not reach a consensual decision either in favour or against the challenge, which according to the terms of Article 58 triggers the Chairman\u2019s decision-making power.\n\n581.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in *EDF v. Argentina* that through Article 58 of the ICSID Convention the \"machinery\" for a challenge was put in place to allow \"swift\" solutions.427 The provision breathes fair and rational procedural economy and the intention to limit the loss of time and the possibility of obstruction to a minimum, as specified in ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. Even assuming that the abstention of President Berman to decide were unjustified, a swift and procedurally economical solution was called for, which for the reasons set out above clearly consisted in having the decision made by the Chairman.\n\n*EDF v*. *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016, para. 115 (C-103).\n\n**(5) The Chairman\u2019s Decisions of 21 February and 13 April 2017**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Committee also has to determine whether the Decisions of 21 February 2017 and 13 April 2017, rejecting the proposal to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder are tenable and reasonable.\n\n583.\n\nIn turning to this exercise, the Committee agrees, as already mentioned, with the majority view of *ad hoc* committees which have found that decisions of remaining arbitrators or the Chairman on the disqualification of an arbitrator must be upheld unless they are \"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"428 This position strikes a fair balance between considerations of procedural economy and integrity which are both central for the ICSID Convention. The procedural system of challenges, as provided for in Articles 57 and 58, is mostly concerned with efficiency and procedural economy and promotes the finality of decisions, while the procedural system of annulment is mostly concerned with the propriety and integrity of the system and establishes the *\"ad hoc* committee as the guardian of the integrity of the arbitral procedure.\"429 The Committee agrees with *Suez v*. *Argentina,* where the *ad hoc* committee found that:\n\n[A] scope of review wide enough to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings but not so wide as to re-consider the merits of a decision that was already taken in the underlying proceedings is in line with the object and purpose of the annulment proceeding within the regime of the ICSID Convention and thus also in line with the interpretation principles of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.430\n\n*EDF v*. *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016, para. 145 (C-103).\n\n*EDF v*. *Argentina.* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016, para. 140 (C-103).\n\n*Suez v*. *Argentina.* Decision on Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment, 5 May 2017, para. 92 (C-109), as confirmed by *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Intergrales de Agua S.A. v*. *Argentine Republic.* ICSID case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment, 14 December 2018, para. 166 (CL-416), and by *Mobil v*. *Argentina.* Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for Annulment. 8 May 2019. paras. 44 ss.\n\n584.\n\nIn maintaining this balance, the Committee does not venture into the field of an appeal proceeding, which would violate the principle of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. It understands the apprehension of the *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix v*. *Argentina* that refused to decide whether \"a decision under Article 58 was correct, as this would be tantamount to an appeal.\"431 When examining whether the Chairman of the Administrative Council rendered decisions that no reasonable decision-maker would have rendered, the issue is not the correctness of the decisions but rather the protection of the basic integrity of the challenge procedure. The legitimate apprehension to avoid a test equivalent to an appeal must not engender the curtailing of committees\u2019 functions to a degree that would prevent the supervision of the integrity of the ICSID system.\n\n*Azurix v*. *Argentina.* Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic. 1 September 2009. para. 282 (C-69).\n\n585.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Chairman rendered a decision which rejected the proposal to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder on procedural grounds. He found that the proposal was not made \"promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed\" as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1). Since the Chairman had refused the proposal on procedural grounds, he did not make a determination as to the merits of the Applicants\u2019 assertions that the two arbitrators lacked the capacity to exercise independent judgment.\n\n586.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Chairman interpreted and applied the term \"promptly\" in appreciating the factual circumstances and the legal requirements.\n\n587.\n\nHe recalls in his decision that:\n\n- during the appointment process, both President Berman and Mr. Veeder had disclosed that they were members of Essex Court Chambers;\n\n- the Applicants appointed Mr. Veeder after having agreed to the presidency of Sir Franklin Berman, thereby implying that the fact that more than one member of Essex Court Chambers served on the Tribunal did not arouse any suspicion as to their independence and neutrality;\n\n- both President Berman and Mr. Veeder had declared that they had no knowledge of the relations between other members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile;\n\n- the Applicants requested the disqualification of President Berman and Mr. Veeder shortly after the Resubmission Award was rendered, when the Tribunal had ceased to exist but was reconvened to decide upon a request for rectification in accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. More specifically, the Applicants state that they discovered the alleged conflict of interest on 20 September 2016. They submitted the matter to the Secretary General on 18 October 2016, whereupon the Centre replied that the Resubmission Tribunal had ceased to exist, whereafter the Applicants filed a request for correction on 7 November 2016 and requested that Messrs. Berman and Veeder make full disclosures of their chambers\u2019 relationship with Chile on 10 November, and finally requested their disqualification;432 and\n\n- that the Chilean press had regularly reported (including during the period of the Resubmission Proceeding) about the involvement of members of Essex Court Chambers in Chilean disputes before international adjudication fora, that the Applicants regularly introduced newspaper articles into the evidentiary record of the case, and that the Applicants based their inquiry into the involvement of members of Essex Court Chambers on an article in the Chilean press that was published a few days after the Resubmission Award of 13 September 2016.\n\nDecision on the Proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. V. V. Veeder QC, 21 February 2017. pp. 2-5; Claimants\u2019 Proposal for the Disqualification of Messrs. Berman and Veeder. 22 November 2016. p. 37 (C-118).\n\n588.\n\nThese elements must be taken into consideration when determining whether no reasonable decision-maker would have possibly reached the decision to apply ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 as done by the Chairman of the Administrative Council,433 and whether no reasonable decision-maker would have possibly rejected the Applicants\u2019 proposal to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder for lack of timeliness.\n\nDecision on the Proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC. 21 February 2017, para. 94.\n\n589.\n\nThe Committee recalls that, with respect to timeliness, the issue before the Committee and already before the Chairman was not to determine whether the members of the Resubmission Tribunal should have made inquiries into these relations and had failed to do so but to determine whether the Applicants should have known that the arbitrators might not have fulfilled their duties.\n\n590.\n\nThe Committee is aware that not all of the press clippings that the Chairman considered were shared with the Applicants. It believes that this was a procedural error which should not have occurred. However, this omission concerns only a few articles and was not result-determinative. The substance of the press clippings referred to are in footnote 69 at paragraph 88 of the decision where the Chairman reasons that the file, and notably press clippings submitted by the Respondent, evidence that it was public knowledge since December 2012 that Chile was assisted in international proceedings by members of Essex Court Chambers. The Chairman then reasons, at paragraph 91, that the Applicants made a regular use of press clippings, which evidences that they studied the press on a regular basis. Only then does the Chairman refer to the press clippings that were not shared with the Parties (identified in footnote 72) to make the additional point that the Applicants used the same or similar sources as those where the information was published regarding Chile\u2019s representation by barristers of Essex Court Chambers. This last point is not indispensable to the Chairman\u2019s finding that the Applicants could and should have known that barristers from Essex Court Chambers were working for Chile in international proceedings.\n\n591.\n\nThe Committee is further aware that press clippings published before the one which triggered the Applicants\u2019 research mentioned names of members of Essex Court Chambers but not their affiliation to the Chambers. The Committee understands the Applicants\u2019 argument that this made it impossible or unreasonably difficult for them to match the publicly available information with Essex Court Chambers and Messrs. Berman and Veeder. However, while the Applicants have presented this argument before the Committee, it does not appear to have been raised before the Chairman. The Applicants\u2019 submissions before the Chairman set out that their challenge was formulated promptly after the press article was discovered on 20 September 2016, but it did not argue why the Applicants could not have found the relevant information at an earlier date.434 In addition, the argument is not self-evident. It may be convincing when presented, but it does not come to mind on a first analysis of the relevant facts. The Committee considers that, in the same way as for an excess of power to be \"manifest,\" it must be perceived without a thorough analysis,435 for a decision of the Chairman to be plainly unreasonable its defect must be perceivable with little effort and without deeper analysis. This is not the case here, since the Applicants\u2019 argument regarding the conclusions that could or could not be drawn from press clippings before the one which triggered their research does not come to mind on a first analysis.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Proposal for the Disqualification of Messrs. Berman and Veeder, 22 November 2016, paras. 74 ss. (C-118).\n\n*Supra,* para. 197.\n\n592.\n\nIn addition, the Chairman\u2019s decision is not based exclusively on the finding impugned by the Applicants that they could and should have discovered that other members of Essex Court Chambers worked for Chile in international proceedings through the press.\n\n593.\n\nOne further element in the Chairman\u2019s reasoning is that the Applicants could and should have questioned Mr. Veeder about the professional relationships of other barristers of Essex Court Chambers:\n\n*92. [...] Si les Demanderesses \u00e9taient pr\u00e9occup\u00e9es par des conflits d'int\u00e9r\u00eats potentiels susceptibles de r\u00e9sulter des relations professionnelles d'autres barristers des Essex Court Chambers, elles auraient pu soulever ce point au moment de la nomination des Arbitres mis en cause. Cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prudent, notamment car il est notoire que les chambers de barristers consid\u00e8rent que les barristers op\u00e8rent dans une stricte ind\u00e9pendance les uns \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des autres, et que les chambers ne sont pas trait\u00e9es comme l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de cabinets d'avocats en mati\u00e8re de conflits. Le dossier de la proc\u00e9dure ne contient aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment indiquant que les Demanderesses avaient des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 ce sujet.*\n\n594.\n\nThe Chairman\u2019s reasoning in this respect is based on the specific circumstances of the case, namely that the Applicants knew President Berman and Mr. Veeder were members of the same barristers\u2019 chamber, on the one hand, and that barristers\u2019 chambers are generally known for considering that their members are independent from each other, on the other hand. Based on these two elements of prior knowledge and of general knowledge, respectively, it was not plainly unreasonable for the Chairman to consider that if the Applicants had concerns regarding possible conflicts of interests arising from membership in the same barristers\u2019 chamber, they could have raised the issue at the time the Arbitrators were appointed. Neither was it plainly unreasonable for the Chairman to take account of this element in his appreciation as to whether the challenge had been brought in a timely manner.\n\n595.\n\nAnother further element relied on by the Chairman was that the challenge had been brought after the Award had been rendered, whereas ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 provides that challenges must be brought promptly \"and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed\":\n\n*94. Pour que la Demande de r\u00e9cusation soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \"dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais\", elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soumise au d\u00e9but de l'instance de nouvel examen, **et en tous les cas avant sa cl\u00f4ture.** Le Tribunal de nouvel examen, tel que reconstitu\u00e9, a commenc\u00e9 l'instance en janvier 2014, a cl\u00f4t l'instance en mars 2016 et a rendu la Sentence rejetant les pr\u00e9tentions des Demanderesses le 13 septembre 2016. Les Demanderesses ont fait une demande de renseignements sur la repr\u00e9sentation du Chili par des barristers des Essex Court Chambers pour la premi\u00e8re fois le 20 septembre 2016 et leur Demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise le 22 novembre 2016. Le Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil administratif consid\u00e8re que cette Demande ne peut \u00eatre consider\u00e9e comme soumise \"dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais\" au sens de l'article 9(1) du R\u00e8glement d\u2019arbitrage, et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e,* [emphasis added ; footnotes omitted]\n\n596.\n\nThis reasoning, based on the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) goes at the finality of arbitral awards. In the present case, it was concerned with the fact that the Resubmission Tribunal was resurrected by a request for the correction of errors made by the Applicants after they had addressed the Secretary-General regarding the alleged conflict of interest and the Secretary-General\u2019s response that the Resubmission Tribunal was *functus officio.*\n\n597.\n\nAgain, the Chairman identified a relevant Arbitration Rule, took into account of its express terms, and confronted them with the specific features of the facts of the case that were relevant for the application of the Rule. This syllogistic reasoning is not plainly unreasonable.\n\n598.\n\nConsidering these observations together, it was not plainly unreasonable and untenable for the Chairman of the Administrative Council to apply ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) and decide that the Applicants\u2019 proposal to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder, made after the closing of the proceeding, was not made promptly.\n\n599.\n\nIt may also be recalled that neither President Berman nor Mr. Veeder had positive knowledge of relations between members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile at the time the Resubmission Award was rendered. As a consequence, such relations could not impair their judgment with respect to the Resubmission Award.\n\n600.\n\nTherefore, the Chairman\u2019s Decision of 21 February 2017 does not violate the integrity of the ICSID proceeding, and the Committee has no authority to disregard it and decide the issue *de novo.*\n\n601.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, the Chairman of the Administrative Council rendered a second \"Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC.\" The Decision combines two distinct proposals for the disqualification of each one, based on unrelated assertions.\n\n602.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Veeder, the Applicants scrutinized the declarations that he had made to explain why he had resigned as president in a different ICSID case.436 The Committee has carefully studied the allegations and finds them correctly summarised by the Chairman:\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 proposal to disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC rests, in substance, on two grounds: a) Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied concerning when he learned that Sir Christopher Greenwood QC\u2019s was appearing as counsel for the claimants in the *Vannessa Ventures* case (\"First Ground\"); and b) Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied when he explained his resignation was not due to the fact that Sir Christopher Greenwood was practicing at Essex Court Chambers (\"Second Ground\").437\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 141-165.\n\nChairman of the Administrative Council, Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC, 13 April 2017, para. 51.\n\n603.\n\nThe Chairman compared the Applicants\u2019 allegations with Mr. Veeder\u2019s explanations as well as additional documents submitted by the Parties and Mr. Veeder. As a result of his review, he did not find \"any evidence that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied as alleged by the Claimants.\"438 In paragraphs 54 to 67 of the decision, he stated the reasons for his analysis and determination.\n\nChairman of the Administrative Council, Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC, 13 April 2017, para. 53.\n\n604.\n\nThe Chairman\u2019s interpretation of the evidence contradicts the Applicants\u2019 interpretation. The Committee has no authority to decide between the two interpretations. It is not a court of appeal. Rather, it has to examine whether the Chairman\u2019s analysis and determination are clearly unreasonable and untenable and violate the integrity and propriety of the proceeding.\n\n605.\n\nThe Committee has studied the Chairman\u2019s analysis. The Chairman considered that the Applicants\u2019 allegation that Mr. Veeder lied was based on the assumption that the terms he used, \"at the jurisdictional hearing\" referred to the precise moment of the hearing - the physical appearance of counsel before the tribunal - rather than to the broader period of time. The Chairman notes that Mr. Veeder has explained that he had learned about the relevant facts during the hearing preparation period, a few days before the hearings started. The Chairman concludes that the terms used by Mr. Veeder do not constitute a lie or a misleading formulation.439 This is a consistent assessment of facts, neither influenced by dishonest submissions nor by bias, and neither untenable nor unreasonable. Therefore, the Committee has no authority to disregard it and to decide the issue *de novo.*\n\nChairman of the Administrative Council. Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC, 13 April 2017, paras. 54-57.\n\n606.\n\nWith respect to President Berman, the Applicants take issue with his letter of 1 March 2017 where he comments the second challenge of Mr. Veeder. President Berman wrote that \"it does not seem to me right that I should sit on this challenge\" because it \"would lay itself open to an accusation that I lacked the necessary objectivity an impartiality,\" especially as \"the new challenge, based as it is on the same ground as the old challenge, is not dissimilar to an appeal against the rejection of the latter.\" He had therefore opined that \"it would be more conducive to the health of the arbitration system [...] if the new challenge, like the old, were to be heard and decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. That would not, in my view, be in any sense incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and the Rules.\"440\n\nLetter of Sir Franklin Berman to the Secretary-General of ICSID, 1 March 2017 (C-160).\n\n607.\n\nThe Committee has already rejected the Applicants\u2019 assertion that the Chairman of the Administrative Council appropriated authority that he did not have when he took it upon himself to decide on the challenge after having received President Berman\u2019s letter.\n\n608.\n\nFurther, the Committee has carefully studied the Chairman\u2019s detailed analysis and determination with respect to the merits of the Applicants\u2019 proposal, in paragraphs 68-77 of the Decision. That analysis dismissed a number of the Applicants\u2019 assertions as manifestly incorrect. The Chairman thus considered that President Berman did not state that the new challenge against Mr. Veeder was \"completely identical\" to the previous one but that it was \"not dissimilar.\" The Chairman further considered that President Berman did not prevent the Applicants from accessing documents as contended by the Applicants, since he did not have the authority to authorise their disclosure, and the Applicants had requested them from the Centre, not from President Berman. On the basis of these and other assessments, the Chairman provided a different interpretation of President Berman\u2019s letter than the Applicants. The Committee has no authority to decide between these different interpretations. It is not a court of appeal. Rather, it has to examine whether the Chairman\u2019s analysis and determinations are clearly unreasonable and untenable, and violate the integrity and propriety of the proceeding.\n\n609.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee observes, first, that the Chairman\u2019s interpretation of the letter is consistent with its text as reproduced above. Second, the Chairman did not apply a manifestly erroneous test in considering that \"a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of Sir Franklin Berman QC\u2019s letter dated 1 March 2017 would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"441 It follows that the Chairman\u2019s decision is not clearly unreasonable and untenable.\n\nChairman of the Administrative Council. Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC, 13 April 2017, para. 77.\n\n610.\n\nTherefore, the Committee has no authority to disregard the Chairman\u2019s Decision and to decide the issue *de novo.*\n\n611.\n\nNone of the specific circumstances relied upon by the Applicants warrant a different conclusion in this respect:\n\n- The fact that the Chairman\u2019s decisions were taken after the Resubmission procedure, *i.e.* in the course of the proceedings on the request for rectification, does not warrant a *de novo* examination but to the contrary, contributed to the Chairman\u2019s finding that the challenge had not been brought in a timely manner.\n\n- Neither is a *de novo* examination warranted by reason of the fact that the Chairman did not take the merits into account but concentrated on purely procedural considerations which allegedly have no *res iudicata* effect. The rules on timeliness are part and parcel of the balance between the safeguard of independence and impartiality, on the one hand, and legal certainty, on the other hand. The finding on timeliness is therefore *res iudicata* as concerns the challenge, in the same way as a finding on the merits would be.\n\n- No new facts have emerged after the Chairman\u2019s decisions that alter the conclusions reached above.\n\n612.\n\nIn sum, the *ad hoc* Committee decides that it would exceed its powers as determined at paragraphs 558 ss. above to determine that the Resubmission Tribunal was not properly constituted. Therefore, it rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Resubmission Award based on Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n613.\n\nIt follows from there that the Resubmission Award was rendered by a properly constituted Tribunal. Therefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Resubmission Award, which they base on the assertion that an award rendered by an improperly constituted tribunal also represents a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, in accordance with Article 52(1)(d). The Committee does not doubt the correctness of the statement. However, the requirements for this ground are not met in the present case.\n\n**C. The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence and burden of proof**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nThe Applicants\u2019 assertions on the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s manifest excess of powers, its serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and its failure to state the reasons on which it has based the Resubmission Award are closely interrelated. They submit that the Resubmission Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by rejecting evidence on facts that had occurred before the entry into force of the BIT on 29 March 1994 as well as after the initiation of the arbitration on 3 November 1997. By doing so, they submit, the Resubmission Tribunal refused to hear and consider the Applicants\u2019 case and demonstrated bias and partiality in Chile\u2019s favour, and it deconstructed the First Award through contradictory, frivolous and incomprehensible reasoning.\n\n**(1) General background**\n--------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe analysis of these assertions requires a full understanding of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s conduct and reasoning taking into account the determinations of the First Tribunal and the First Committee and considering the arguments and conduct of the Parties which are still relevant in this phase of the proceeding. The exercise is as complex as it is unavoidable.\n\n616.\n\nThe First Tribunal, the Resubmission Tribunal, the First Committee, the Applicants and the Respondent agree that the confiscations between 1973 and 1975 by the military regime were illegal, anti-constitutional and warranted compensation under Chilean law.\n\n617.\n\nThe First Tribunal found and the First Committee and the Resubmission Tribunal confirmed and accepted as final that Mr. Pey was an investor when the confiscation was completed in 1975 and that the Applicants were investors when they initiated the ICSID arbitration in 1997. In so finding, both tribunals and the First Committee rejected the Respondent\u2019s argument that Mr. Pey\u2019s alleged investments ceased to exist with the confiscation,442 contrary to the Applicants\u2019 allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal had followed the Respondent\u2019s arguments. Therefore, the allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal was partial does not find a basis in the Resubmission Award.443\n\nChile's Memorial on the Annulment of the Award of 10 June 2010, para. 418 (C-269).\n\nCf. Resubmission Award, paras. 177-179, 181-183, 244.\n\n618.\n\nThat is the factual background that brought the First Tribunal to ascertain its jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* in accordance with Article 2(2) BIT, which extends its applicability \"to investments made prior to its entry into force.\"444\n\nFirst Award, paras. 419-465.\n\n619.\n\nAfter having distinguished *\"la comp\u00e9tence ratione temporis du Tribunal de l'applicabilit\u00e9* ratione temporis *des obligations de fond continues dans l\u2019APIf\"445* the First Tribunal rejected the claims for expropriation, on the basis that it was completed by Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975. As analysed in Chapter VII.A. of this Decision, the First Tribunal found considerations of illegality and anti-constitutionality of Decree No. 165 irrelevant for the determination of the completion of the expropriation. The First Tribunal concluded that *\"les dispositions de fond de l'APIn '\u00e9taient pas applicables \u00e0 l expropriation des biens des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda.\"446*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 466. 577.\n\nFirst Award, para. 620.\n\n620.\n\nThe First Tribunal presented as a logical consequence of this finding that allegations, discussions and evidence in relation to the expropriation were not pertinent and could not be used to establish a prejudice resulting from a different cause. This statement is made in unambiguous terms in Chapter VIII, paragraph 688 of the First Award:\n\n*L\u2019expropriation survenue avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e de l\u2019examen du Tribunal arbitral, il en r\u00e9sulte que, pour cette raison d\u00e9j\u00e0, les all\u00e9gations, discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait de l\u2019expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d'\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d\u2019une autre cause, de fait et de de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un \"traitement juste et \u00e9quitable\".* [footnotes omitted ; emphasis omitted]\n\n621.\n\nThe First Committee validated the rejection of claims based on expropriation but annulled paragraph 4 of the *dispositif* of the First Award ordering Chile to compensate the Applicants for damages \"and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII).\"447\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 359.1.\n\n622.\n\nThe First Committee \"found an annullable error in the process which the Tribunal followed in reaching its conclusion not in the way it calculated the amount of damages,\"448 and that \"the issue in the present case is not per se the quantum of damages determined by the Tribunal. Nor does the problem lie per se in the Tribunal\u2019s chosen method of calculating the damages suffered by the Claimants. The issue lies precisely in the reasoning followed by the Tribunal to determine the appropriate method of calculation, which, as demonstrated above, is plainly contradictory.\"449\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 271.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 286.\n\n623.\n\nThere has been some discussion during this annulment proceeding as to what the Committee might have meant when it annulled the \"corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)\" and both Parties have referred to paragraphs of Section VIII to back their arguments.450 The Resubmission Tribunal also examined paragraphs of Chapter VIII, especially where they \"relate to matters of factual evidence and proof, they are not tainted by the criticism of the *ad hoc* Committee relating to the assessment of material damages,\"451 because they \"illuminate the reasoning of the First Tribunal in the un-annulled portions of the Award.\"452\n\nTr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), pp. 70-72; Annulment Application, paras. 194, 211; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 503-504; Reply on Annulment, para. 73; Rejoinder on Annulment, para. 86.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 243.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 223.\n\n624.\n\nThe issue is of immediate relevance with respect to paragraph 688 of the First Award. It is notable that the First Committee repeatedly referred to paragraph 688 and quoted it twice, each time affirmatively and drawing conclusions that hinge upon the finality of paragraph 688. That is the case in paragraph 261 of the Annulment Decision where the First Committee finds an acknowledgment by the First Tribunal that backs the First Committee\u2019s arguments, and that is the case in paragraph 283 of the Annulment Decision where the First Committee quotes paragraph 688 to find that \"the Tribunal expressly stated that an evaluation of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the expropriation was irrelevant and that all the allegations, discussion and evidence related to such damages could not be considered by the Tribunal.\"\n\n625.\n\nIn both cases, the First Committee made the content of paragraph 688 its own. This becomes evident when the wording is compared. While the First Tribunal formulates in paragraph 688 that the *\"preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait de l'expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d\u2019une autre cause, de fait et de de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un \u2018traitement juste et \u00e9quitable\u2019,\"* the First Committee formulates, in introducing the debate on paragraph 688, that an expropriation-based calculation of damages was irrelevant for the calculation of damages resulting from FET violations, \"since the Claimants\u2019 claim for expropriation was outside the tremporal scope of the BIT.\"453 It would be plainly contradictory to assume that the First Committee wanted to confirm the substance of paragraph 688 of the First Award and at the same time to annul it. Therefore, this Committee interprets the First Committee\u2019s decision to annul \"the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)\"454 as meaning that only the paragraphs that adjudicate compensation for damages resulting from violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard by referring to the standard of expropriation are concerned. It believes that the First Committee\u2019s formulation in paragraph 359(4), where it mentions \"Section VIII,\" is but a short-hand reference to paragraph 359(1) and does not express the intention to contradict it.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 282.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 359(1).\n\n626.\n\nAs a consequence of the foregoing, it is *res iudicata,* as explicitly confirmed in paragraphs 282 and 283 of the First Annulment Decision, that the evidence presented by the Applicants to prove their prejudice caused by the expropriation could not be taken into consideration, neither by the First Tribunal nor by the Resubmission Tribunal, to calculate the damages caused by the violation of fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n627.\n\nThis is what was expressly acknowledged in the Resubmission Award. At some point, the Resubmission Award seems to suggest the unannulled parts of the First Award only established the breach and left the determination of the injury entirely untouched: this is the case where the Resubmission Tribunal states that \"[s]ince the first stage, the establishment of breach, has already been determined with binding effect by the First Award, the Tribunal can begin with the second, the ascertainment of the injury caused by the breach.\"455 At a later stage in its reasoning, however, the Resubmission Tribunal leaves no doubt that the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect extends to the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that the damage arising from the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard cannot be based on the damage caused by the expropriation. At paragraph 228 of its award, the Resubmission Tribunal thus states:\n\nThe present Tribunal draws the following conclusions from the above, **which represent its interpretation of the** ***res judicata*** **portions of the First Award** for the purposes of carrying out its own mandate of deciding on the \"compensation\" due under paragraph 3 of the dispositive of the First Award for the breach determined in paragraph 2 thereof: a) that the original expropriation of El Clarin and the related assets belonging to Mr Pey Casado was consummated in 1975 and consequently lies outside the scope of the BIT; **that all arguments based on or arising out of the expropriation may not be taken into consideration, except in so far as they constitute factual background** to matters that are properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT. [emphasis added]\n\nAnd further at paragraph 230 of the Resubmission Award:\n\nThe consequence of this interpretation of the First Award is, in the opinion of the Tribunal, as follows: [...]\n\nd) that **any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award** and must therefore be rejected, [emphasis added]\n\nFor the reasons set out in paragraphs 623 to 625 above, this interpretation by the Resubmission Tribunal was in conformity with the First Committee\u2019s Decision and therefore with the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 217.\n\n**(2) The Applicants\u2019 handling of the** ***res iudicata*** **effect**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nThe Applicants assert the relevance of the evidence they presented to establish the fair market value of their investment at the time of the confiscation in 1973/1975 from what they consider to be a different perspective. They submitted, before the Resubmission Tribunal, that the amount of compensation to be granted under the denial of justice/fair and equitable treatment claims had to be appraised on the basis of the value of the assets confiscated in 1973/1975. If the Chilean courts had not denied justice by delaying a judgment that would have recognized the absolute nullity of Decree No. 165 from the outset, the First Tribunal would have found that the nature of the expropriation was continuous and would have ascertained the respective claim. For that reason, the amount of damages owed under Article 4 BIT is the equivalent of the amount due under Article 5.\n\n629.\n\nFor these reasons, the Applicants requested the Resubmission Tribunal to *\"condamne[r] la D\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 indemniser les Demanderesses \u00e0 hauteur de l\u2019indemnisation qu\u2019elles auraient d\u00fb recevoir, si le d\u00e9ni de justice, la discrimination et leur effet n\u2019avaient pas eu lieu, en compensation des saisies de CPP S.A. et EPC Lt\u00e9e.\"456* In their *M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique,* the Applicants contended:\n\n*La cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9ni de justice a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 de priver les Demanderesses de faire pleinement valoir leurs rapports de droit vis-\u00e0-vis l'Etat du Chili existant apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019API, dans leur demande de r\u00e9paration pour le pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sultant de la privation* de facto *de leur droit sur l\u2019investissement effectu\u00e9 en 1972 et au d\u00e9dommagement correspondant.

This is explicitly and unambiguously stated at paragraph 688 of the First Award, which the First Committee validated and where the First Tribunal reasoned that *\"les [...] preuves relatives au dommage [...] du fait de l\u2019expropriation [...] ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s\u2019agissant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant* [...] *du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un \u2018traitement juste et \u00e9quitable.\u2019\"*\n\n635.\n\nIt is further evidenced by paragraph 689 of the First Award where the tribunal determined that *\"les demanderesses n'ont pas apport\u00e9 de preuve, ou de preuve convaincante [...] des importants dommages all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et caus\u00e9s par les faits relevant de la comp\u00e9tence ratione temporis du Tribunal arbitral\"464 -* thus confirming, again, that the evidence the Applicants adduced regarding the expropriation was irrelevant to the valuation of damages arising from the breach of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nFirst Award, para. 689.\n\n636.\n\nThe First Committee confirmed the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that \"the duty to provide redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end,\"465 that \"the post-BIT acts by Chile that it [the First Tribunal] ultimately considered to be treaty violations [...] were completely separate and distinct form the 1975 expropriation,\"466 and that \"the parties never pleaded damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 of the BIT.\"467\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 168.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 159.\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, para. 262.\n\n637.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal was confronted with these determinations. It examined both parties\u2019 experts during the evidentiary hearing,468 summarised the Applicants\u2019 position as presented in the written submissions,469 and was convinced that the \"resubmission proceedings, which were thorough and complete, allowed the Claimants the fullest opportunity\" to show \"what particular injury and damage could be proved to have been caused to them by the breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4 of the BIT determined in the First Award.\"470 For the reasons already mentioned, it stated \"that any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.\"471 It further formulated the \"central question\" as to whether \"the Claimants have met that burden of proving what injury was caused to either or both of them by the Respondent\u2019s breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding assessable damage in financial terms.\"472\n\nTranscript of the hearing before the Resubmission Tribunal (15 April 2015), pp. 160 ss.

However, in the light of the above, the statement must be understood as meaning that the Applicants failed to adduce evidence of their prejudice that was not based on the value of the expropriated assets and which the Resubmission Tribunal could take into account given the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award. This is correct, since the Applicants argued before the Resubmission Tribunal that the damages should be calculated by reference to the expropriation.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 232, 233.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 233.\n\n639.\n\nThis conclusion does not contradict the First Tribunal\u2019s observation, as asserted by the Applicants, that it was not hindered *\"de prendre en consid\u00e9ration des faits ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la date d\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9 pour examiner le contexte dans lequel sont intervenus les actes que les demanderesses estiment devoir \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de violations post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du trait\u00e9,\"* for \"purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or scope of violations of the BIT that occurred after its entry into force.\"475 The Resubmission Tribunal echoes this view when it writes that it would take evidence and arguments on expropriation into consideration \"in so far as they constitute factual background to matters that are properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT.\"476 However, while these passages taken in isolation might warrant the approach taken by the Applicants before the Resubmission Tribunal, this isolated reading was contradicted by the unambiguous determination by the First Tribunal, that the valuation of damages for the breach of fair and equitable treatment could not be based on the value of the expropriated assets.\n\nFirst Award, paras. 611, 614, citing *M.C.I Power Group L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007, para. 93.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 228(a).\n\n640.\n\nTherefore, when the Resubmission Tribunal rejected the evidence which the Applicants presented in the context of the expropriation to prove damages caused by violations of Article 4 BIT, it neither exceeded its powers, nor was it biased when it followed the *res iudicata* determination of the First Tribunal as confirmed by the First Committee. The fact that the decision favoured the Respondent cannot be interpreted as a documentation of bias. Further, the Resubmission Tribunal has repeatedly and consistently explained why it felt obliged to reject the evidence, in other words it stated the reasons that motivated its decision.\n\n641.\n\nThis Committee understands that since the Applicants considered, in good faith, that paragraphs 611 and 614 of the First Award allowed them to base their claim for reparation before the Resubmission Tribunal on the value of the expropriated assets, they could not understand the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s statement that they had failed to address their burden of proof. As set out above, however, the Applicants\u2019 position was based on an erroneous interpretation of the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award.\n\n**(3) The alleged \"denial of justice\"**\n---------------------------------------\n\n642.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal did not commit a denial of justice by not considering the evidence for expropriation, as asserted by the Applicants in reliance on Professor Benjamin Remy\u2019s comment of the Resubmission Award.477 Professor Remy\u2019s argument is that the damages related to the denial of justice consist in a loss of opportunity to obtain compensation for the expropriation in Chilean courts based on Chilean law, and that the Resubmission Tribunal took too broad a view on the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award in holding that it precluded the Resubmission Tribunal from calculating the damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard by reference to the value of the expropriated assets.\n\nBenjamin Remy, \"Chronique de la jurisprudence du CIRDI\", J.D.I. (Clunet), 2017, pp. 278 ss. (CL-333).\n\n643.\n\nProfessor Remy more specifically argues that the *res iudicata* effect of the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that the expropriation of 1973 did not violate the BIT precluded the Resubmission Tribunal from finding that the expropriation did violate the BIT, but did not prevent it from taking account of the expropriation as a fact for the purpose of evaluating the damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.478 This analysis would be undisputable if the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect were indeed limited to the finding that the expropriation did not violate the BIT. However, as set out in detail in the previous section, the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect as determined by the First Committee was not so limited. It extended to the finding that the evidence relating to the damage caused by the expropriation could not be used to establish the damage caused by the denial of justice and the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Accordingly, the Resubmission Tribunal did not take too broad a view of the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect.\n\nBenjamin Remy, *op. cit.,* pp. 282-283 (CL-333).\n\n644.\n\nAs a consequence, the Resubmission Tribunal did not commit a denial of justice in dismissing the Applicants\u2019 argument seeking to establish the damage caused by the denial of justice and the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard on the basis of the damage caused by the expropriation.\n\n645.\n\nIn addition, the Applicants erred in complaining that the Resubmission Tribunal oriented the issue of the nullity of Decree No. 165 and the resulting claims towards the \"domestic sphere\" by stating that \"if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decision No. 43 did indeed have decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment continued to be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation, the remedy for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal.\"479 This opinion, they assert, equates to a denial of justice by the Resubmission Tribunal, since it knew that the Applicants had chosen international arbitration under the fork in the road clause in Article 10 of the BIT and that this choice was *\"irreversible.\"480* The assertion is incorrect because the Resubmission Tribunal did not dismiss the Applicants\u2019 claim for damages under international law *because* it considered there was a claim to be brought under domestic law. Rather, having found that there was no remedy in the international sphere, the Resubmission Tribunal added *obiter* that it could possibly be found in the domestic sphere: \"the remedy *could* lie in the domestic sphere *but clearly not* before this Tribunal in these resubmission proceedings\" (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Resubmission Tribunal did not dismiss the Applicants\u2019 international claim to the advantage of a domestic claim. It dismissed the international claim on its own merits. This is not a denial of justice. Nor is it a denial of justice that due to the exercise of their rights under the fork-in-the-road provision, the Applicants are deprived of compensation in both the domestic and international spheres.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 198.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 59.\n\n**(4) The arguments and evidence postdating the request for arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nThe Applicants not only alleged an improper lack of consideration of evidence and arguments before the entry into force of the BIT in 1994, they also alleged that the Resubmission Tribunal rejected arguments and evidence covering the period after 3 November 1997, date of the request for arbitration.\n\n647.\n\nThe Applicants refer to paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award. The Committee has carefully studied that paragraph and finds that the thrust of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is that it has no authority to address issues, arguments and evidence that were not before the First Tribunal, *i.e.* having occurred \"after the handing down of the First Award.\" It is true that the Resubmission Tribunal refers to the critical date of the original request for arbitration and states that issues arising between the Parties after that date do not fall within the scope of Resubmission Proceeding. However, it is also true that the Resubmission Tribunal accepted, without hesitation, the determination of the First Tribunal as *res iudicata* with respect to the actions and omissions of the Respondent that occurred after the request for arbitration, in particular, the Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 and the unsuccessful Chilean court proceedings that had lasted 7 years before they were abandoned on 2 November 2002 in order to expand the scope of the ICSID proceedings.\n\n648.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal also accepted the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that disputes between the Parties had begun in 2000 and 2002, leading to the establishment of jurisdiction under Article 2.3 BIT.481 However, it had not taken into consideration that a Chilean court rendered a judgment on 24 July 2008 on the nullity of Decree No. 165. This judgment post-dates the First Award of 8 May 2008, and the Applicants have, indeed, criticised the Tribunal for not having taken issues into account *\"post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la Sentence Initiale.\"482*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 448-464.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 570-577.\n\n649.\n\nTaken together, the Committee finds that in paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award the Tribunal tried to express that it had no jurisdiction over issues, arguments and evidence that had not been before the First Tribunal. That is reflected in the repeated affirmation that issues arising after the date of the First Award are outside the scope of the proceedings.\n\n650.\n\nA different interpretation of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasoning would lead to the contradictory and absurd result that the Committee would have to assume that the Resubmission Tribunal considers on the one hand that events that were before the First Tribunal would be outside the scope, and on the other hand that the events between 1997 and 2008 that were before the Tribunal would be inside the scope of the proceedings.\n\n651.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is intelligible when paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award is read in the context of the general reasoning as meaning that issues, arguments and evidence that have not been submitted before the First Tribunal were outside the scope of the resubmission proceedings. This interpretation corresponds to paragraphs 68/69 of the Resubmission Award, where the Tribunal lists events that have not been before the First Tribunal and that the Applicants qualified as a new denial of justice.\n\n652.\n\nThis interpretation is all the more appropriate since the alternative literal interpretation and a finding on its internal contradiction would not impact on the result. Even accepting its insufficiency, the Resubmission Tribunal has not followed its own statement but accepted all of the determinations of the First Tribunal based on facts occurring after 3 November 1997 and before the date of the Award on 8 May 2008 as *res iudicata.*\n\n653.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Committee determines that the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence and the qualification of the burden of proof do not contain annullable errors rising to the level of a manifest excess of powers or a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It further holds that the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons on which it has based the Award.\n\n**D. The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to give** ***res iudicata*** **effect to unannulled findings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n654.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee also has to determine whether the Resubmission Tribunal, when dealing with the First Award and delimitating the annulled parts and the final findings:\n\n(1) manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(2) seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure; and/or\n\n(3) failed to state the reasons on which it based the Award.\n\n**(1) Manifest excess of powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n655.\n\nThe Committee recalls that a resubmission tribunal exceeds its powers when:\n\n- it determines an issue *de novo* that the original tribunal already determined, and that was confirmed by an *ad hoc* committee and not annulled and therefore is final, *res iudicata;*\n\n- it fails to decide issues brought before it although it had the mandate and power to decide; and\n\n- it fails to apply the applicable law instead of applying and interpreting it, even erroneously.\n\n656.\n\nThe standard is uncontroversial and explicitly acknowledged by the Resubmission Tribunal. It noted that:\n\n[I]t has been finally determined: that the dispute falls within ICSID jurisdiction; that Chile (the Respondent) was in breach of its obligation to accord to the Claimants fair and equitable treatment (including to abstain from any denial of justice); that the Claimants have a right to compensation; and finally that any further or other claims were rejected. All of that, in other words, has the quality of *res judicata* (\u2018chose jug\u00e9e\u2019)\n\n[...]\n\nNot only is there no need for the Tribunal to go into these matters, but it would be a manifest excess of its own jurisdiction if the Tribunal purported to do so.483\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 176, 178 (footnotes omitted).\n\n657.\n\nThe Committee will analyse the issue of compensation at a later stage. Here, at the outset, it rejects the Applicants\u2019 assertions that the Resubmission Tribunal re-opened the debate and analysis on the protection of the Applicants\u2019 rights and investment through the BIT of 1994 against unfair and unequitable treatment that had occurred during 1995 and 2002 for the denial of justice and in 2000 for arbitrary and discriminatory treatment. In accepting the First Tribunal\u2019s determination and not deciding *de novo* on the relevance of facts after 1997, the Resubmission Tribunal respected the *res iudicata* determination on the fair and equitable treatment standard violations and on the relevance of facts after 1997. The fact that the Resubmission Tribunal asked questions during the hearing on the issues of investment and on the relevance of Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 is irrelevant for this finding since the questions are not reflected in the Award.\n\n***(a) The First Annulment Decision as concerns Section VIII of the First Award***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nThe Applicants also allege that the Resubmission Tribunal re-opened the issue of evidence with respect to injury and damages and their causation by the violation of Article 4 BIT against the *res iudicata* determination of the First Tribunal according to which the arguments, the theory and the evidence presented by the Applicants for the injury and damage caused by the confiscation in 1973-1975 met the requirements of identification and proof of injury and damages caused by the unfair and unequitable treatment. The Applicants allege that the Resubmission Tribunal came to its erroneous appreciation because it systematically and fraudulently confused the issues of injury and damage on the one hand and compensation and quantum on the other.\n\n659.\n\nIn order to properly assess these assertions, it is necessary to appraise exactly which parts of the First Annulment Decision were established as *res iudicata* of the First Award and which parts were annulled.\n\n660.\n\nThe First Committee squarely annulled the First Award\u2019s decision on quantum of compensation. However, as already quoted in paragraphs 620 ss. of this Decision, it is less evident what it intended to annul when it stated \"and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)\" and later that \"the body of the Award but for Section VIII are *res judicata.\"484*\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, paras. 359(1) and (4).\n\n661.\n\nThat sounds straightforward without being so. As we have seen, the First Committee relied on several of the paragraphs from Section VIII to make certain arguments. This Committee does not assume that the First Committee would have approved the content of statements that it considered should be annulled. Further, at the beginning of Section VIII, the First Tribunal summarised that the Applicants were investors and treated unfairly and unequitably by the Respondent, that Article 4 BIT is applicable, that the illegality of the confiscations is uncontested,485 and that it remains as the Tribunal\u2019s task \"\u00e0 *tirer les cons\u00e9quences de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, quant \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019indemniser, son ex\u00e9cution concr\u00e8te et le calcul de son montant\"486*\n\nFirst Award, paras. 675-678.\n\nFirst Award, para. 679.\n\n662.\n\nIf the First Committee\u2019s determination in paragraph 359 of its Decision was interpreted as meaning that Section VIII is annulled in its totality, this would lead to the absurd result that key determinations of the First Award would be annulled as being part of Section VIII, while the very same determinations would be upheld as also being part of the unannulled Section VII. Accordingly, the Committee interprets paragraph 359 of the First Annulment Decision, as already presented in paragraph 625 of this Decision, as meaning that only those paragraphs of Section VIII that deal with the adjudication of damages are annulled.\n\n663.\n\nAs a consequence, it is *res iudicata* that (a) the claim for compensation for the injury and damage caused by the illegal confiscation is outside the temporal scope of the BIT and that (b) the claim for compensation for the injury and damage caused by the fair and equitable standard violations is inside the scope of the BIT. These are final determinations of the First Tribunal, as developed in Section VII and summarised in the first five paragraphs of Section VIII of the First Award and as validated by the First Committee.\n\n664.\n\nSection VII of the First Award does not specifically explain whether the damages caused by the completed expropriation and thereby their proof and calculation are also precluded *ratione temporis.* The First Tribunal notes that the instantaneous act of the expropriation *\"n'est pas cr\u00e9atrice d\u2019une situation continue\"* and that the expropriatory acts *\"\u00e9tant achev\u00e9s et ne pouvant donner naissance \u00e0 une situation continue.\"*487 It further referred to the Articles on Responsibility of States, which provide, in Article 14, that the breach of an international obligation occurs when the act is performed, define in Article 2 that a breach of an international obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful act, and establish in Article 31 the obligation of full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. This implies that injuries caused by breaches that are not covered by an international treaty cannot be adjudicated.\n\nFirst Award, para. 610.\n\n665.\n\nThese reasons indicate that the First Tribunal considered that the facts and evidence proving damages and quantum caused by the expropriation could not be taken into consideration for violations that occurred after the entry into force of the BIT. By no means do they indicate positively that the Tribunal found these facts and evidence relevant for the proof of damages caused by the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n666.\n\nApparently, the Resubmission Tribunal was in no hurry to develop its findings on injury and damage in Section VII, because it had reserved the discussion on the three issues (1) *\"obligation d\u2019indemniser,\"* (2) *\"son ex\u00e9cution concr\u00e8te,\"* (3) *\"et le calcul de son montant\"* for Section VIII, as exposed in paragraph 679 of the First Award.\n\n667.\n\nParagraph 679 is part of the introductory portion of Section VIII. The Applicants have consistently argued that it is not annulled and have relied on it for their arguments.488 The Committee agrees with the Applicants: it does not concern the damages but refers back to Section VII and clarifies it.489\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 194, 206, 211; Memorial on Annulment, para. 504; Reply on Annulment, para. 73.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 502.\n\n668.\n\nThis reading of paragraph 679 is reinforced by the First Annulment Decision. In Section G of the First Annulment Decision, which is devoted to \"Damages,\" the First Committee states, in paragraph 262, that the \"Parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 f the BIT\" and specifies in paragraphs 267 to 269 that it understands \"damages claims\" as meaning \"the standard of compensation and evaluation of damages\" as well as \"damages methodology and calculations.\"\n\n669.\n\nTaken together, these findings of the First Tribunal, as confirmed by the First Committee, give strong indications in favour of an interpretation consistent with the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s finding that the First Tribunal had not considered the facts and evidence with regard to the uncontested illegal expropriation as relevant for the proof of damages and their amount under Article 4 BIT, and that \"all evidence and arguments related to that expropriation is to be excluded as not relevant to the dispute\"490 over compensation under Article 4.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 217, 228, 230.\n\n670.\n\nThis interpretation is further reinforced by paragraph 688 of the First Award, which confirms the existence of damages caused by confiscation but adds that:\n\n[L]*es all\u00e9gations, discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait de l\u2019expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retenues s'agissant d'\u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice, r\u00e9sultant lui d\u2019une autre cause, de fait et de droit, celle du d\u00e9ni de justice et du refus d\u2019un* \"traitement juste et \u00e9quitable\".491\n\nFirst Award, para. 688 (footnotes omitted; emphasis omitted).\n\n671.\n\nAs explained in paragraph 625 of this Decision, the First Committee has repeatedly approved this statement of the First Tribunal.\n\n672.\n\nAs a consequence, the Committee holds that the First Tribunal did not determine, with *res iudicata* effect, that the proof of damages caused by the confiscation was relevant for the proof of damages caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It actually determined the opposite. Therefore, the Resubmission Tribunal did not disrespect a *res iudicata* finding and did not exceed its powers when it decided not to consider the evidence relied upon by the Applicants, and when it decided to examine whether the fair and equitable treatment standard violations, as a distinct claim, had caused injury and damage.\n\n***(b) The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the term \"compensation\"***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n673.\n\nWith respect to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s determination not to grant financial compensation by defining the concept of compensation in a way that contradicts the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* decision, the Applicants present two related arguments.\n\n674.\n\nFirst, they assert that the Parties had agreed that under international law the term compensation necessarily implies pecuniary indemnification and that the Resubmission Tribunal was bound to exercise its authority in respect of this agreement.\n\n675.\n\nIn paragraphs 200 and 201 of its Award, the Resubmission Tribunal took note of the fact that during the hearing the Applicants had argued that it should \"understand the term \u2018compensation\u2019 as referring only to monetary compensation\", and that the \"Respondent, for its part, agreed with much of the Claimants\u2019 answer.\" The Tribunal had taken \"note of these views but does not subscribe fully to the reading.\"492\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 200, 201.\n\n676.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Applicants\u2019 argument that the authority of arbitral tribunals is based on the agreement of parties which exercise their autonomy and that tribunals exceed their authority by not respecting the parties\u2019 agreements. However, an agreement in the meaning of a common expression of the parties\u2019 intention to enter into a binding undertaking requires a meeting of the minds in this sense.\n\n677.\n\nThis is not the case when, as here, the Parties hold similar views on an issue of interpretation of the law. In such instance, there is no meeting of their minds binding the Tribunal in its interpretative powers.\n\n678.\n\nThis leads to a second assertion. The Applicants submit that independently of the Parties agreement, the term \"compensation\" in international law, as described and specified by Articles 31-39 of the Articles on State Responsibility, necessarily refers to financial reparation as expressed in Article 36 and not to satisfaction under Article 37, which is reserved to cases where compensation does not provide full reparation of damages.\n\n679.\n\nThe Committee essentially agrees with the Applicants\u2019 argument. The Resubmission Tribunal cannot be blamed for not having defined the term \"compensation\" by reference to Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility, because the Resubmission Tribunal was explicitly using the French term *\"compensation\"* as in the French authentic version of the First Award,493 and the French version of Article 36 uses the term \"indemnisation,\" not \"compensation.\" It remains, however, that the term \"compensation\" was used in the First Award as a term of art influenced by English legal terminology and referring to financial reparation.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 199.\n\n680.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal, however, considered that the fact that the internationally wrongful act in the present case \"[was] one in which the breach is constituted not by a single act but by a course of conduct\" changed the factual situation in a way that a different interpretation of the term \"compensation\" was adequate.494 In that perspective, it \"[saw] in the First Award no sign that the First Tribunal was setting out to make a conceptually systematic usage of these various terms that would justify treating paragraph 3 [of the First Award] as a deliberate determination that monetary damages must necessarily follow.\"495 Therefore, the Resubmission Tribunal felt authorised to give the term a broader meaning than the one necessarily encompassing a financial element.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 204.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 201.\n\n681.\n\nThe Committee disagrees. It does not make any difference whether a wrongful act is a single act or \"a course of conduct,\" as explicitly provided for in Articles 14 and 15 of the Articles on State Responsibility. A course of conduct cannot remove the wrongfulness of one or many acts, and it cannot remove the obligation of the wrongdoer to make full reparation for injury, as provided for in Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n682.\n\nThe Committee hesitated as to how to qualify the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s approach: as a non-annullable misapplication and misinterpretation of international law or as an annullable non-application of the applicable law.\n\n683.\n\nIn that context, the Committee recalls that it is not a court of appeal. It is convinced that \"a misapplication of the applicable law is not an annullable error [...] provided it is not of a magnitude as to amount to a veritable non-application of the proper law as a whole.\"496 It is also conscious of the legitimacy of the annulment mechanism. Its objective is to \"reconcile finality of the award with the need to prevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.\"497\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention - A Commentary* (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, para. 232 (RALA-0006).\n\nICSID Secretariat, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* 5 Mav 2016, para. 7.\n\n684.\n\nIn this perspective, the Committee has examined what the impact on the result of the Resubmission Proceeding would be if the Resubmission Tribunal had correctly interpreted the term \"compensation\" as used in the First Award. No annulment should follow if the error has no bearing on the outcome of the proceeding. This is of direct relevance to the present case. Keeping this basic consideration in mind, the Committee may not be called upon to make a final determination on the qualification of the Tribunal\u2019s error under the circumstances of the case.\n\n685.\n\nFor the Resubmission Tribunal to have manifestly exceeded its power, the finding of the First Tribunal would have to be read as meaning, not that the Applicants have a right to compensation provided that their prejudice is established, but that they have an unreserved right to compensation whatever the evidence or the absence thereof.\n\n686.\n\nThe interpretation of the First Award as conferring upon the Applicants an unreserved right to compensation irrespective of the evidence is not reasonable. It is incompatible with the prohibition under Article 42(3) Convention for ICSID Tribunals to decide *ex aequo et bono* unless the parties so agree.\n\n687.\n\nIt follows that the Applicants\u2019 *\"right to compensation\"* pursuant to the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award must be interpreted as being implicitly conditional on the establishment of damages in accordance with the applicable rules of international law. Therefore, the First Award accords the Applicants a right to compensation \"for any financially assessable damage that they may establish.\"\n\n688.\n\nIn light of this, the Resubmission Tribunal affirmed that it read the First Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Applicants *\"ont droit a compensation\"* (paragraph 3 of the *dispositif),* following the determination that the Respondent violated its duty to guarantee fair and equitable treatment (paragraph 2 of the *dispositif)* and preceding the order to pay a precise amount of compensation (paragraph 4 of the *dispositif):*\n\n[A]s stating the entitlement to reparation that necessarily follows from the determination of the breach of an international obligation, but without predetermining what form or nature that reparation must take, except perhaps the non-explicit assumption that in the normal case it may take the form of monetary damages. But it does not read the paragraph as absolving a party claiming monetary damages from its normal obligation to prove such damage, including its causation.498\n\nResubmission Award, para. 201.\n\n689.\n\nThus the Resubmission Tribunal referred to two cumulative limbs for the adjudication of damages. One is the \"form or nature\" of reparation and the other is the burden to prove the damage. As concerns the burden of proof, the Resubmission Tribunal reasons that it is \"a basic tenet of investment arbitration that a claimant must prove its pleaded loss.\"499\n\nResubmission Award, para. 205.\n\n690.\n\nBy this line of reasoning, the Resubmission Tribunal refers to the definition in Article 36(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility which links compensation to \"financially assessable damage.\" The Resubmission Tribunal did not state that the Applicants did not suffer damage. Nor did it state that the damage was not financially assessable. What it did state is - and that it is not in contradiction to a *res iudicata* finding - that material damage not only had to be assessable but assessed and proven as resulting from violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard to justify compensation.\n\n691.\n\nThe First Tribunal identified two distinct claims, one based on illegal expropriation and another one based on violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It found that the expropriation claim was outside the temporal scope of the BIT. It therefore urged Chile to compensate the Applicants under Chilean law, because it did not see a basis for compensation under international law. The Resubmission Tribunal came to a similar conclusion in paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award.\n\n692.\n\nThe First Tribunal also found that damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard would have been inside the temporal scope of the BIT but that the Applicants had concentrated their efforts on proving damages caused by that violation on the damage caused by expropriation and thus, had not discharged their burden of proof with respect to damage caused by violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Driven by the wish to grant some monetary compensation, the First Tribunal replaced the Applicants\u2019 burden to prove damages by some *\"\u00e9l\u00e9ments objectifs,\"* which it had found in a parallel compensation for expropriation.500 It reproduced this line of reasoning in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the *dispositif* of the First Award and condemned the Respondent to pay an amount of money to the Applicants although the damage had not been proven, and had relied on calculations which had been made to assess the damage for expropriation.\n\nFirst Award, para. 692.\n\n693.\n\nThe First Committee annulled this reasoning and result because the Parties had not been afforded an opportunity to be heard on the methodology, standard and calculation, and because they were contradictory in the sense that they neutralised each other. It found that the allocation of damages based on the value of the expropriated assets contradicted the Tribunal\u2019s previous finding that the evidence regarding the damage caused by the expropriation was irrelevant since the expropriation did not fall in the temporal scope of application of the treaty. As a result, it is *res iudicata* that the Respondent violated the fair and equitable treatment standard after the entry into force of the BIT and after the request for arbitration, and that it owed the Applicants compensation, but it is not *res iudicata* that the Applicants discharged their burden of proof for injury and damage suffered nor, in the alternative, that they were entitled to receive compensation without having to prove the existence and quantum of injury and damage.\n\n694.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal tried to avoid the First Tribunal\u2019s annulled errors. It appropriated the First Tribunal\u2019s general statement that the Applicants bore the burden of proving that damage had been caused by the distinct fair and equitable treatment standard violations, that the proof of damages resulting from expropriation was irrelevant, and could not be transplanted, and that *\"la simple vraisemblance d\u2019un dommage dans les circonstances concr\u00e8tes de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne* [suffisait] *\u00e9videmment pas.\"501*\n\nFirst Award, para. 689.\n\n695.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal relied on these findings of the First Tribunal because it considered them to be principles of international law. The Resubmission Tribunal insisted that it:\n\n[B]elieves this analysis to be entirely consistent with the findings of the *ad hoc* Committee in its Annulment Decision, notably its paragraph 261, in which the *ad hoc* Committee draws from the First Award the holdings by the First Tribunal that the Claimants\u2019 arguments as to damages were strictly limited to ones founded on the expropriation; that these were not relevant to the claims for denial of justice and discrimination; and that the Claimants had not produced any convincing proof of damage in respect of these claims.502\n\nResubmission Award, para. 229.\n\n696.\n\nThe Applicants allege that the Tribunal\u2019s statement in paragraph 229 distorts the meaning of paragraph 261 of the First Annulment Decision.503 This Committee has studied and compared both paragraphs. It has not found a distortion but an almost literal reproduction.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 201.\n\n697.\n\nIn the end, and as explained in detail in the preceding Section, the Resubmission Tribunal found that the Applicants had been given a full opportunity to prove their injury and damage caused by the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard and that they failed to present evidence to prove such a claim. This finding does not contradict any *res iudicata* effect of the sections of the First Award which were not annulled.\n\n698.\n\nTherefore, of the two cumulative limbs necessary to ascertain an excess of powers by not granting monetary compensation, in contradiction to the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* findings, one limb does not exist to support the request. Even if the Committee had found an annullable error in the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s definition of the term \"compensation\" and not only a non-annullable misapplication, such finding would have no bearing on the result of the proceeding, since the Applicants have not satisfied the criteria of the second limb, *i.e.* their burden to prove the financially assessable damage.\n\n699.\n\nAs a result, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 assertion that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers when it denied the claim for alleged damages for a violation of the Respondent\u2019s duty to guarantee fair and equitable treatment.\n\n**(2) A Serious Departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n700.\n\nThe Applicants allege that the Resubmission Tribunal disrespected the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award and distorted the First Award and the First Annulment Decision in order to serve the Respondent\u2019s interests, that it systematically sided with the Respondent to avoid an order to oblige it to pay financial compensation, and that, generally, it has acted in bad faith. They argue this systematic bias in favour of the Respondent represents a departure from the most fundamental rule of procedure, *i.e.* the obligation to treat parties neutrally and equally.\n\n701.\n\nThe Committee has found that the Resubmission Tribunal did not exceed its powers. Beyond the repeated expression of suspicion with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s intentions, the Applicants have neither substantiated nor proved their allegations.\n\n702.\n\nTherefore, the Committee is unable to discern bias and partiality on the part of the Resubmission Tribunal and thereby a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**(3) A failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n703.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal opens the Section on its Analysis with a detailed description of its role where it summarises the major findings of the First Tribunal and the First Committee, situates its task in this frame and asserts that it is aware that transgressing the frame and the *res iudicata* findings would be a manifest excess of power.504\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 171-179.\n\n704.\n\nIt then presents the Applicants\u2019 request for relief by referring to their financial expert, as well as the controversy between the Parties with respect to the admissibility of the claim.505\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 189-196.\n\n705.\n\nAfter an excursus on the status of Decree No. 165, which was very much in the Parties\u2019 focus,506 and a detailed discussion on the concept of compensation, which has been addressed in the preceding part of this Decision,507 the Tribunal devoted some thirty paragraphs to the crucial issue of the burden of proof, first by setting out the standard and then by applying the standard to the facts of the case. It regularly re-assured itself that it moved its reasoning within the frame of *res iudicata.*\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 197-198.\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 199-204.\n\n706.\n\nThe Committee has no vocation to criticise the quality of or to express its agreement with the reasoning. However, it does not hesitate to confirm that it was able to follow the reasoning and did not find it frivolous.\n\n707.\n\nHowever, the Committee has considered whether there is a contradiction between paragraphs 196 and 232-233 of the Resubmission Award with respect to the consideration of evidence and burden of proof.\n\n708.\n\nParagraph 196 of the Resubmission Award follows up on the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasoning at paragraph 195 that the *res iudicata* effect of the First Award seems \"to put an insuperable obstacle in the way of the Claimants now advancing a claim to damage which in its essence goes back to that original dispossession, by using the value of the then-expropriated property as its central element.\" In summarising the Applicants\u2019 answer thereto at paragraph 196, the Resubmission Award contains a concise but specific and clear presentation of the Applicants\u2019 position regarding its damage, which they understood as being caused by a loss of opportunity. More specifically, the Resubmission Award summarises the Applicants\u2019 position as being that:\n\n[T]he central consequence of the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press, was that they (the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely null *(ex tunc)* and as such incapable of producing any legal effects. Had they been in a position to do so, the argument continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able to recover their confiscated property in Chile, or at the least would have been able to establish before the First Tribunal that the expropriation of this property was not an instantaneous act taking final effect in 1975, but was not in fact completed until many years later, and the result of that would have been that the expropriation did indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal under the BIT, contrary to the findings in the First Award. From this it follows, so the Claimants\u2019 argument concludes, that the loss suffered by them arising out of the denial of justice is the loss of that right to compensation in the original arbitration, so that such loss is the one they can now claim in the present proceedings.508\n\nResubmission Award, para. 196.\n\n709.\n\nParagraphs 232 and 233 conclude that the Applicants failed to discharge their burden of proof with regard to the injury, the damage and the quantification of damage and that \"in some senses they have not even set out to do so in as much as they have focussed their submissions on the evaluation of damage, without undertaking the prior step of showing the precise nature of the injury, causation and damage itself.\"509\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 232-233 (emphasis omitted).\n\n710.\n\nThe Applicants qualified these two presentations on proof of damage as \"inconsistent.\"\n\n711.\n\nThe Committee has to determine whether they are contradictory in a sense that they neutralise each other or \"cancel each other out.\" Inconsistency and error are not enough to warrant an annulment.\n\n712.\n\nThe Committee has come to the conclusion that there is no contradiction. Paragraph 196 summarises the Applicants\u2019 position with respect to the evidence on injury and damages resulting from the confiscation and its possible transplant to unfair and unequitable treatment. In paragraphs 232 and 233, the Resubmission Tribunal analyses whether the Applicants have effectively met their burden of proof, as announced in paragraph 231, which introduces the Chapter.\n\n713.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s statement at paragraph 232 that the Applicants failed to set out their damage does not imply that the Resubmission Tribunal did not consider or answer the Applicants\u2019 position as summarised at paragraph 196. This position of the Applicants was addressed in detail in Section H of the Resubmission Award, which is situated between paragraphs 196 and 232, and where the Resubmission Tribunal analyses the scope of the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect. As already mentioned in paragraphs 661-672 above, the Resubmission Tribunal finds that it has been decided with *res iudicata* effect that the damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard cannot be based on the value of expropriated assets. In paragraph 230, which is the penultimate paragraph of Section H, the Resubmission Tribunal thus concludes that the \"consequence of this interpretation of the First Award is, in the opinion of the Tribunal, as follows: [...] d) that any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.\" The Resubmission Tribunal then pursues in paragraph 231 that the remaining question is \"whether, and to what extent, the Claimants have met that burden of proving what injury was caused to either or both of them by the Respondent\u2019s breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding assessable damage in financial terms.\" The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasons taken as a whole are thus to the effect that (i) the Applicants assert that the damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard must be calculated on the basis of the expropriated assets; (ii) the First Tribunal has found with *res iudicata* effect that this cannot be done; and therefore (iii) the Applicants have \"not even set out\" to establish their damage *within the limits set by the First Award\u2019s* res iudicata *effect.* This nuance to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s statement in paragraph 232 of the Resubmission Award is implicit but certain in the light of the reasons in the preceding Section H.\n\n714.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons on which it based its Award.\n\n715.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the Award for having failed to give *res iudicata* effect to the First Tribunal\u2019s unannulled findings.\n\n**E. The Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the applicable law in the Resubmission Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n716.\n\nWith respect to moral damages, the Resubmission Tribunal did not deny that international arbitration tribunals are competent to award compensation for moral damages. Therefore, as a matter of principle, its position is in line with the Applicants\u2019 assertion, the authorities presented by them, and the First Tribunal.510\n\nFirst Award, para. 704. Although sitting in the annulled Section of the Award, the statement of principle may be referred to, particularly since no consequence follows from there.\n\n717.\n\nIt excluded *a limine* a claim for moral damages of the second Applicant, the Foundation President Allende, because \"no attempt was made to advance, or to justify, a specific claim that moral damage had been suffered by the Foundation.\"511 The Committee sees no error in this.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 243.\n\n718.\n\nAs to the claim of Mr. Pey Casado, the Resubmission Tribunal found that he bore the burden, under international law, to prove his moral damage and that he had failed to meet this burden. This finding echoes the First Tribunal\u2019s finding in paragraph 704 of the First Award. The Resubmission Tribunal presents this finding as its own position \"on the basis of the written and oral submissions made to it by the Claimants,\" and refers to paragraph 704 being aware that it figures in the annulled Section of the First Award, \"but, as they relate to matters of factual evidence and proof, they are not tainted by the criticisms of the ad hoc Committee relating to the assessment of material damages.\"512\n\nResubmission Award, para. 243.\n\n719.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Resubmission Tribunal should have applied Chilean court practice, which exempts damaged persons from the burden of proof. The Committee does not agree. Where reparation is due for a violation of *international* law, there is no need to determine reparation pursuant to the domestic law of the host State and its courts\u2019 practice in that respect. Violations of the BIT trigger responsibility under international law and give rise to reparation under international law. Chilean court practice is not relevant for the rules on evidence for a claim under international law.\n\n720.\n\nContrary to what the Applicants\u2019 argue,513 this remains unaffected by the fact that the reparation concerned is for a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard and a denial of justice by the Chilean domestic courts and in the Chilean domestic legal system. First, when it comes to determining the damage caused by a denial of justice and a breach of fair and equitable treatment by reference to the reparation the investor could, absent these violations, have obtained in the domestic legal system, the rules of domestic law determining that reparation are not part of the law applicable by the ICSID tribunal. They are part of the *minor* of the legal syllogism, that is, they are part of the facts to which the relevant rule of international law must be applied, and in the same way as a domestic law is a fact when it comes to determining whether it is compatible with the state\u2019s international obligations. Second, the Applicants cannot claim moral damages by reference to what they could have obtained in the Chilean domestic legal system, because there is no evidence that the relevant Chilean proceedings were ever concerned with moral damages. The Chilean court proceedings that were delayed in violation of the prohibition of denial of justice were concerned with the restitution of the Goss Press, reparation of possible damages to the press and *lucrum cessans.514* Decision No. 43 granted third parties compensation for the expropriation of El Clarin without there being question of moral damages.515 Accordingly, absent the denial of justice and the violation of fair and equitable treatment, the Applicants would still not have obtained any moral damages in the Chilean legal system. As a consequence, the Applicants\u2019 argument is also based on a wrong factual assumption.\n\nProfessor Robert Howse, Tr. Day 1 (12 March 2019), pp. 33-34 (French version).\n\nDemande de M. Pey Casado aupr\u00e8s du 1er Tribunal civil de Santiago en restitution des presses GOSS, 4 October 1995, in particular pp. 3-4 (C-266).\n\nD\u00e9cision n\u00b0 43 du Minist\u00e8re des Biens Nationaux du Chili, 28 April 2000, in particular pp. 2-3 (C-180).\n\n721.\n\nFurther, the Applicants criticise the Resubmission Tribunal for not having applied Article 31(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that moral damage may be compensated even if no material damage is present.\n\n722.\n\nHowever, it is only after having found that \"the claim to moral damages must be [...] rejected\" for want of proof,516 that the Resubmission Tribunal discussed, in the conditional, what would have happened if the claim for material damages had been proven and the claim for moral damages had been made out. It speculates what it might have done under such hypothetical circumstances. The Committee has no authority to make a judgment on such speculation. However, it could not possibly give rise to an annullable error, since it was *obiter* and thus left the Award unaffected.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 243.\n\n723.\n\nTherefore, the Committee does not find that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers when it rejected a claim for moral damages. It rejects the Applicants\u2019 claim to annul paragraph 243 of the Resubmission Award without further inquiry as to whether the Applicants abandoned it, as alleged by the Respondent.\n\n724.\n\nWith respect to the alleged claim for unjust enrichment, the Resubmission Tribunal explained that the First Tribunal adjudicated the Applicants\u2019 claim for compensation based on violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and that this is as much *res iudicata* as its \"definitive rejection of all the Claimants\u2019 claims in the dispute other than those covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositive part of the First Award.\"517 The Resubmission Tribunal further considered that the Applicants\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment could be interpreted in two ways, both of which were incompatible with the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect. According to a first approach, the unjust enrichment claim amounted to bringing a claim disconnected from any violation of the BIT, which was incompatible with the First Award\u2019s res *iudicata* effect of granting compensation only for the denial of justice and the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.518 According to a second approach, the unjust enrichment claim was a means of calculating damages for a right to compensation established by other means, by reference to the value of the confiscated assets and lost profits. In that case, the Resubmission Tribunal considered, this amounted to \"reintroducing under another guise the precluded expropriation claim.\"519\n\nResubmission Award, para. 176.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 239.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 240.\n\n725.\n\nIt follows that the Applicants err in criticizing the Resubmission Tribunal for not having applied the law applicable to unjust enrichment, namely general international law which is part of the law applicable pursuant to Article 10(4) of the BIT. The Resubmission Tribunal rejected the Applicants\u2019 claim on the basis of the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect. It was therefore not authorised to apply the doctrine of unjust enrichment pursuant to the law applicable to it. The Applicants\u2019 request for annulment based on the non-application of the applicable law therefore fails.\n\n726.\n\nIn addition, the Committee finds that the Resubmission Tribunal thereby correctly interpreted and respected the First Award\u2019s *res iudicata* effect. To the extent that the unjust enrichment claim was detached from any violation of the BIT, it could not be decided upon by the Resubmission Tribunal whose powers were limited by paragraphs 2 and 3 of the First Award\u2019s *dispositif.* To the extent that the unjust enrichment claim was *not* detached from any violation of the BIT, and to the extent that it triggered a calculation based on the value of the expropriated assets and lost profits, it was precluded either by the *res iudicata* finding that expropriation fell outside the temporal scope of application of the BIT, or by the *res iudicata* finding that damages caused by the violation of fair and equitable treatment could not be calculated by reference to the expropriated assets. Contrary to what the Applicants assert,520 this was not a misinterpretation of the Applicants\u2019 thesis but a correct analysis of its ambit and implications.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 275.\n\n727.\n\nTherefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul Section K of the Resubmission Award without further inquiry into whether the Applicants abandoned it, as alleged by the Respondent.\n\n**F. The dismissal of the restitution claim for damages suffered due to the defense of the investment and the access to arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request for procedural reasons, as well as on the merits.\n\n729.\n\nIt agrees with the Applicants that they were not obligated to submit a complete presentation of their requests for annulment for the four grounds invoked with their application for annulment. The time bar of 120 days after the date of the award does not hinder new arguments from being developed in the course of the proceeding.\n\n730.\n\nWhile this is uncontested, *ad hoc* committees are not exempt from analysing whether new presentations represent new grounds for annulment, which would be precluded after 120 days after the award, or new elaborations on grounds which are already on file, which would be admissible.\n\n731.\n\nIt is not enough to submit an annulment application copying Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and leave the arguments for a later stage. As unequivocally stipulated in ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c), the application for annulment shall \"state in detail [...] the grounds on which it is based.\" This wording clarifies that a simple listing of the reasons invoked does not fulfil the requirements of a complete application.\n\n732.\n\nThe reason behind the time limit as well as for the quality requirement is to protect the finality of the award. Finality is a central feature of the arbitration system. Parties are accorded four months to conclude whether, in their view, the award is tainted by such fundamental flaws that its maintenance endangers the integrity and propriety of the system. They may be convinced that the totality of the award is tainted by such deficiencies or only parts. They may define specific issues, topics and/or conduct, which violate the integrity of the proceeding by an excess of power, a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and/or the absence of reasons. These grounds for annulment have to be established for each issue, topic and conduct separately.\n\n733.\n\nThe other party and the *ad hoc* committee should be informed of the precise reasons which motivate an applicant to question the integrity and propriety of the constitution of the tribunal, the tribunal\u2019s conduct and/or the outcome of the proceeding, early on. Therefore, the detailed statement of grounds is not a purely procedural orientation without substantial relevance. Rather, it sets the stage for the annulment proceeding.\n\n734.\n\nThat does not mean that the annulment application has to be a complete presentation of the arguments. If so, the sequence referred to in ICSID Arbitration Rule 31 would be superfluous. It is in this sense that the *ad hoc* committee in *Wena v*. *Egypt* reasoned:\n\nThe ICSID Convention thus does not preclude raising new arguments which are related to a ground of annulment invoked within the time limit fixed in the Convention. This is of no harm to the opposing party, which is not requested to answer the Request, but later only the first memorial of the Applicant.521\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt.* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, para. 19 (CL-314).\n\n735.\n\nThe *Wena* committee considered the element of timeliness important but accepted that no harm was to be expected as long as the arguments concerning previously invoked grounds were introduced with the first memorial thus giving the opposing party an opportunity to understand the motivation and react to the arguments.\n\n736.\n\nIn the present case, the Applicants presented conduct related to a number of well-defined issues which to their conviction were tainted with serious and annullable flaws, such as the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence, of claims for unjust enrichment and moral damages, the application of the applicable law, or the Decision on Rectification. It is evident for the Committee that these issues were set out in the Annulment Application and that nothing hindered the Applicants from complementing their initial arguments with respect to the different issues at a later stage.\n\n737.\n\nWith respect to incidental expenses and costs, the situation is different.\n\n738.\n\nFirst, contrary to the *Wena* case, as referred to above, the Applicants did not complement the initial Annulment Application with fuller arguments in the Memorial on Annulment. Rather, they introduced the topic only with the Reply on Annulment, although they were fully aware of the problem from the beginning of the annulment proceeding, and nothing in the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial existed to trigger a new awareness.\n\n739.\n\nSecond, the incidental costs issue is not a new argument in the context of a targeted conduct of the Tribunal within the sphere of defined issues. Rather, it is a new issue referring to specific conduct. A detailed statement in the sense of ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c) would have required presenting the conduct and the issue early on, in order to establish the framework for the annulment request. The Applicants had the duty to scrutinise the Award and form their conviction as to what conduct, issues and topics were so entrenched with errors that warranted annulment. By informing the Respondent, the Centre and the *ad hoc* Committee of these issues and topics, they stated implicitly that the other conduct, issues and topics were not tainted by annullable error and were to be considered final.\n\n740.\n\nNothing would have hindered the Applicants from complementing their initial arguments by more elaborate ones, once the framework was established in the initial application. Conversely, it was untimely to introduce the topic only with the Reply on Annulment.\n\n741.\n\nFor this procedural reason, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request for annulment for the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of incidental costs as untimely.\n\n742.\n\nFurther, the Committee finds that the Resubmission Tribunal did not violate its duty to state the reasons for the rejection of \"all other claims\" (paragraph 256(8) - Decision of the Resubmission Award), including the claim for incidental costs.\n\n743.\n\nAs presented by the Applicants, the claim for incidental costs was connected to their claim under Article 4 of the BIT, for violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n744.\n\nIndeed, such expenses and costs are closely related and connected to the primary claim for compensation of damages resulting from violations of duties under Article 4 of the BIT. They arise, in the words of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, \"directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute.\"\n\n745.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal correctly determined that the *res iudicata* cost decisions of the First Tribunal and the First Committee did not enter into the realm of its authority. With respect to the financial compensation, it had decided that the Respondent did not owe the Applicants any, and that \"it cannot therefore, in principle, make any award of damages\"522 for the principal claim. It had further decided that it \"will make no further order as to costs,\" in addition to the costs of the arbitration.523\n\nResubmission Award, para. 234.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 251.\n\n746.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s mind, there is no doubt that the Resubmission Tribunal considered the claim for incidental costs as contingent on the original claim, and that the dismissal of the second claim implied the dismissal of the first, and that no specific cost decision was appropriate.\n\n747.\n\nThe Applicants allege that the Tribunal did not respect Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention when it did not address the claim for incidental costs. However, the Committee agrees with Professor Schreuer who explains that \"[i]f an argument rests on premises that have been dismissed by the tribunal, the argument need not be addressed as long as the tribunal has stated reasons for dismissing the premises.\"524 Applied to the situation in the present case, the Committee finds that since the original claim was dismissed and reasons are stated, the dismissal of the claim for consecutive damages and the reasons for it can be deduced as being implied in the dismissal of the principal claim. The reasoning *in toto* is understandable and does not warrant annulment for lack of reasons.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention -A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, para. 433 (RALA-0006).\n\n748.\n\nIn light of this result, the Resubmission Tribunal was under no procedural obligation to consider the documents evidencing the amount of the costs, because it had decided that the Applicants had no claim in principle. The fact that this result favours the Respondent does not allow for the assumption of the existence of partiality. The Respondent has not provided substantiated reasons that would lead to a different result.\n\n749.\n\nTherefore, the requests for annulment of the Resubmission Award for lack of reasons and a departure from a rule of procedure in the treatment of *\"dommages cons\u00e9cutifs\"* or incidental damages are rejected.\n\n**G. The decision on the status of Ms. Coral Pey Grebe in the resubmission proceeding**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n750.\n\nThe Applicants did not introduce the issue of Ms. Pey Grebe\u2019s status and the grounds warranting annulment of the Award in the context of this issue into the Annulment Proceeding with the Annulment Application but only with the Memorial on Annulment of 27 April 2018. They have not explained why they failed to do so despite the fact that the issue had been addressed prominently and in detail in Section III.B. of the Resubmission Award.\n\n751.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the Committee rejects the Applicants\u2019 request to annul the first paragraph of the *dispositif* and paragraphs 187-188 of the Resubmission Award for manifest excess of powers, as requested in paragraph 753 of the Memorial on Annulment, and for the additional grounds of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and absence of reasons, as requested in paragraph 250 of the Reply on Annulment, and to annul the whole Award for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (partiality), as requested in paragraph 251 of the Reply on Annulment, both for procedural reasons and on the merits.\n\n752.\n\nWith respect to procedural reasons, the Committee reiterates the arguments developed in Chapter VIII.F. of this Decision.\n\n753.\n\nThe Applicants had the duty to establish the framework for the annulment proceeding by stating, in detail, which circumstances, issues, conduct and topics warrant annulment and on the basis of which grounds. Once done within the period of 120 days after the Award, the Applicants were free to complete the application with new arguments.\n\n754.\n\nThe Applicants chose not to introduce the issue of Ms. Pey Grebe\u2019s status in a timely manner, although they were aware of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s conduct and determination. No new information has come up to explain that choice. In accordance with Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c), they failed to present their conviction that the Resubmission Award was tainted by annullable errors in this regard and have not validly questioned its finality.\n\n755.\n\nFurther, the Committee finds that the Resubmission Tribunal did not violate its duties in any of the ways described in Article 52(1)(b), (d), and (e) of the ICSID Convention. The Resubmission Tribunal exercised its powers in accordance with its interpretation of the ICSID Convention. The interpretation might be contested but the Committee has no authority to judge what interpretation is correct or preferable.\n\n756.\n\nIn paragraphs 43-48, 125-130 and 185-186 the Resubmission Tribunal summarised the Parties\u2019 positions on the status of Ms. Pey Grebe, and in paragraphs 187-188 it developed its analysis and determination on the subject-matter.\n\n757.\n\nContrary to the Applicants\u2019 assertion, the Resubmission Tribunal did not deny that Mr. Pey Casado validly assigned his shares to Ms. Pey Grebe. It also did not deny the validity of the assignment of shares to the Foundation President Allende or its status of investor and Party in the arbitration proceeding.\n\n758.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s position, and in line with the First Tribunal\u2019s determination as confirmed by the First Committee, the Resubmission Tribunal held, that the expropriation of 1973-1975 had no effect on the transferability of the shares for the purposes of the arbitration proceeding, neither for the transfer of shares to the Foundation President Allende in 1990 nor for the transfer of shares to Ms. Pey Grebe in 2013:\n\n[T]here is no dispute between the two sides that there has been a cession of rights, in good faith, between Mr Pey Casado and his daughter, which has been made for good reason, or that both the cession itself and the reason for it were disclosed to the Tribunal, as they had been to the First Tribunal at an earlier stage.525\n\nResubmission Award, para. 187.\n\n759.\n\nFurther and again contrary to the Applicants\u2019 assertion, the Resubmission Tribunal did not re-discuss the nationality requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. It indeed stated its conviction that \"a new claimant party cannot simply freeload on the back of jurisdictional claims of others [...] evading the jurisdictional requirements of [...] the ICSID Convention.\"526\n\nResubmission Award, para. 187.\n\n760.\n\nThe Applicants seem to interpret this statement as an indication that the Resubmission Tribunal wanted to question the fulfilment of the nationality requirement of Ms. Pey Grebe. If that were the case, they would have failed to read the sentence that follows immediately the sentence quoted. The Resubmission Tribunal stated: \"[t]hat is not the case here,\"527 meaning that the jurisdictional requirements for Ms. Pey Grebe need not be examined because they were irrelevant for the ongoing proceeding.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 187.\n\n761.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal came to this conclusion after having examined the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding in interpreting Articles 52(6) and 53(1) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3)528 and finding that \"the present proceedings are a continuation of the original arbitration.\"529\n\nResubmission Award, paras. 173-178.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 188.\n\n762.\n\nThe Tribunal deduced that:\n\nThe jurisdictional link as between Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation, and the Republic of Chile, has been definitively established by the First Award, and is *res judicata,* those persons or entities continue to be the Parties under whose name the present proceedings are conducted.530\n\nResubmission Award, para. 187.\n\n763.\n\nThis reasoning is consistent. It does not deny Ms. Pey Grebe\u2019s status as an investor after the assignment and it does not refer to nationality requirements. Rather, it determines that she cannot substitute Mr. Pey Casado in the Resubmission Proceeding. It focuses its analysis on the quality of the parties that initiated the proceeding in 1997 and conducted them through the original arbitration and the first annulment phases, and it considers decisive that these parties must remain parties in the resubmission phase.\n\n764.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal applied Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention in its literal and ordinary meaning, as explained in Schreuer\u2019s Commentary:\n\nSubmission to a new tribunal is in respect of \"the dispute\". This means that the parties to the resubmitted proceeding must be the same parties as in the original proceeding. [...] [P]roblems may arise if there is a change of corporate structure, assignment of rights or a dissolution of a corporate investor.531\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention A Commentary* (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article 52, paras. 670-671 (RALA-0006).\n\n765.\n\nTherefore, the Resubmission Tribunal not only exercised its authority when not admitting Ms. Pey Grebe as one of the Claimants, but it also exercised this authority in application of the applicable law, *i.e.* the ICSID Convention. The Committee has no power to analyse whether the application is erroneous.\n\n766.\n\nThe result of the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s determination is that Ms. Pey Grebe cannot be considered a Claimant in the proceeding as a consequence of the assignment of shares. That is a specific ruling, which is not correctly characterised by the Applicants\u2019 generic suggestion that she is in \"legal limbo\" and that the Resubmission Tribunal blocked her access to and protection by international arbitration. For the present proceeding, the Resubmission Tribunal indicated that harm was not unavoidable in the circumstances, because she was able to influence the proceeding as mandated by her father in cooperation with counsel and that possible proceeds could be shared by an \"internal arrangement.\"532\n\nResubmission Award, para. 188.\n\n767.\n\nFurther, the Resubmission Tribunal stated the reasons for its determination by first recapitulating the Parties\u2019 position and then presenting its own analysis. Unlike what the Applicants assert, this is no *\"ex cathedra\"* assertion but an application of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which has the advantage of corresponding to its ordinary meaning. Again, the Committee will refrain from analysing whether the reasons are adequate or not. It concludes that the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons on which it based the decision not to admit Ms. Pey Grebe as co-Claimant.\n\n768.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s reasons are not contradictory. The Applicants submit that it mused over the internal distribution of financial compensation between Mr. Pey Casado and Ms. Pey Grebe, only to dismiss the claim for financial compensation at a later stage. These two statements do not neutralise each other. The first one addresses an eventuality of financial compensation and considers its possible distribution. The second one decides on the reality of the rejection of financial compensation. Therefore, both statements are concerned with different matters and cannot cancel each other out.\n\n769.\n\nThe Applicants further contend that the Tribunal exceeded it powers by disrespecting the First Tribunal\u2019s *res iudicata* finding that the assignment of shares and rights had been effective and had founded the quality of co-Claimant in the proceedings.\n\n770.\n\nThe Applicants refer to the assignment of rights to the Foundation President Allende.\n\n771.\n\nHowever, the reference and the reasoning are inapposite in the context of the assignment of rights to Ms. Pey Grebe. They confuse the substantive validity of the assignment, which is not questioned by the Resubmission Tribunal, with the procedural issue of change of parties, which is questioned.\n\n772.\n\nThe latter issue did not exist in the initial phase. Mr. Pey Casado had transferred a part of his shares to the Foundation in 1990. They both initiated the arbitration proceeding in 1997. Once the question of a valid assignment of expropriated shares resolved in favour of the Claimants - as done by the First Tribunal, confirmed by the First Committee (and accepted as *res iudicata* by the Resubmission Tribunal) - there was no doubt that the Foundation could be a co-Claimant.\n\n773.\n\nObviously, the First Award of 8 May 2008 was not called upon to and could not make any *res iudicata* determination on the procedural status of Ms. Pey Grebe based on the transfer of shares in 2013. A *res iudicata* effect does not extend by analogy to future events.\n\n774.\n\nThis is all the more so since the circumstances are not comparable. The standing of the Foundation resulted from its ownership of shares acquired some seven years before the dispute was brought to arbitration, whereas Ms. Pey Grebe\u2019s acquisition of ownership post-dates the initiation of the proceeding by some 16 years, and the case had been pending with identical Parties for this period. No *res iudicata* effect hindered the Resubmission Tribunal from deciding an issue differently from a decision of the First Tribunal which concerned a different issue.\n\n775.\n\nIn addition, and again contrary to the Applicants\u2019 assertion, the Tribunal has not imposed Ms. Pey Grebe as new counsel on the Applicants and even less replaced Dr. Garc\u00e9s by her. The Applicants confuse the procedural power of attorney and the mandate under substantive law.\n\n776.\n\nThe lack of the Tribunal\u2019s intention in this direction is well documented in the Resubmission Award. On the cover page, the Tribunal lists Dr. Garc\u00e9s as the only representative of the Applicants, in cooperation with others, among whom Ms. Pey Grebe does not figure. In paragraph 35 of the Award, Ms. Pey Grebe is mentioned as representing the Foundation.\n\n777.\n\nInstead, the intention of the Resubmission Tribunal was to define a place for Ms. Pey Grebe in proceedings in which she had had an active role. As set out in paragraph 187 of the Resubmission Award, the Resubmission Tribunal considered that \"the substance of the arrangements in their actual operation is that Ms Pey Grebe, the daughter, acts in practice as the legal representative of her aged father,\" which the Resubmission Tribunal clarified as meaning that \"counsel for the Claimants were in practice taking detailed instructions from Ms Pey Grebe on her father\u2019s behalf, rather than from Mr Pey Casado in person.\" In other words, the Resubmission Tribunal did not regard Ms Pey Grebe as acting *in lieu* of Dr. Garc\u00e9s, but as acting *in lieu* of her father in instructing Dr. Garc\u00e9s and also \"for all purposes relating to the award of such compensation.\"533 This was also confirmed by the Applicants. In their letter of 12 October 2018 addressed to the Centre, they wrote in the context of the continuation of the proceeding after Mr. Pey Casado\u2019s death that Ms. Pey Grebe has instructed counsel - as the Foundation had done before - that the proceeding should continue. That is an unequivocal statement in the sense that they wanted a defined role for her, in case she was not admitted as party, and that this role would consist in her instructing counsel as her father had done originally.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 188.\n\n778.\n\nIt follows that the Resubmission Tribunal did not impose a new counsel on Mr. Pey Casado and did not replace Dr. Garc\u00e9s with Ms. Pey Grebe. Accordingly, the Applicants\u2019 allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure has no factual basis.\n\n779.\n\nFinally, in paragraph 251 of their Reply on Annulment, the Applicants vaguely associate the two assertions of an excess of powers and the failure to present reasons to allege that they evidence a manifest partiality. The Applicants did not substantiate the allegation. The Committee is therefore unable to enter into a deeper analysis of the allegation and has to reject the request for annulment for manifest partiality.\n\n780.\n\nIn sum, the Applicants\u2019 requests for annulment of parts and/or the totality of the Resubmission Award with respect to the issue of Ms. Pey Grebe\u2019s status in the proceeding fail for procedural and substantive reasons.\n\n**H. The Finding on Costs in the Rectification Decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n781.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that tribunals have broad discretion to determine, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), \"how and by whom\" the expenses and costs of ICSID, the tribunal and parties are borne. Discretion does not imply complete freedom. It must be based on retraceable rationality and not be exercised arbitrarily.\n\n782.\n\nAlthough based on discretion, a decision on costs is part of an award. The duty to state reasons for the decision extends to it.\n\n783.\n\nWith respect to this principle, the Committee agrees with the Applicants. It has to examine whether these criteria are met in the present case.\n\n784.\n\nIn its decision on costs for the Resubmission Proceeding, the Tribunal concluded that \"as a general principle, a successful litigant [...] ought to be protected against the cost and expense of having to litigate.\"534 Still, and in accordance with the First Tribunal, it took additional circumstances into account, including the general conduct of the Parties. As a result, it split the arbitration costs between the Parties although it recognised that the Respondent had prevailed. An important reason for the Resubmission Tribunal was that \"the Claimants had good reasons to bring the resubmission proceedings as such.\"535 No resistance was voiced by the Respondent or by the Applicants, in whose partial favour the Resubmission Tribunal had decided.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 249.\n\nResubmission Award, para. 250.\n\n785.\n\nIn its Rectification Decision, the Tribunal stated that it \"can see no good reason why the same principle should not apply\" for the rectification proceeding.536\n\nRectification Decision, para. 56.\n\n786.\n\nIn applying the principle, the Resubmission Tribunal outlined the procedural history of the rectification proceeding. The proceeding had taken almost one year and was punctuated by the Applicants\u2019 requests for suspension linked to repeated requests for document production and their request for discontinuance, as well as suspensions due to the Applicants\u2019 repeated proposals to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder. Both of these proposals were rejected by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n787.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the different requests and proposals had no connection to the rectification proceeding and decided that they \"will not be further considered in the present Decision except in relation to the allocation of costs.\"537\n\nRectification Decision, fn. 2.\n\n788.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal rectified four errors in the Resubmission Award, partly in response to the Applicants\u2019 proposals, partly in response to the Respondent\u2019s proposal. It found that three of them are \"of purely formal import,\" and that in any event none of them had \"any perceptible impact on the meaning or effect of the Resubmission Award as such.\"538 The Committee reviewed the rectifications and has no reason to object to the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s appreciation.\n\nRectification Decision, para. 57.\n\n789.\n\nThe Resubmission Tribunal took \"these factors into account\"539 and recalled the principle that good reasons should exist to bring issues before a tribunal and unnecessary costs should be avoided. It concluded that taken together, the factors justified a cost decision to exempt the Respondent from any expenses and costs and to place the burden on the Applicants.\n\nRectification Decision, para. 58.\n\n790.\n\nThese are considerations and reasons stated to explain the non-arbitrariness of the cost decision.\n\n791.\n\nIt would have been for the Applicants to explain why this line of reasoning and determination amounted to a manifest excess of power and/or a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and in what way paragraphs 56-58 of the Rectification Decision, in conjunction with paragraphs 249-251 of the Resubmission Award, can be equated to an absence of reasons. They have failed to do so. Neither paragraph 280 of the Annulment Application nor paragraph 757 of the Memorial on Annulment contain any substantiation to this end.\n\n792.\n\nIn any event, the Resubmission Tribunal\u2019s Decision does not contradict the principle formulated in paragraph 249 of the Resubmission Award. The Resubmission Tribunal did not state, in paragraph 56 of the Rectification Decision, that it would apply the same allocation key as the one applied in the Resubmission Award. Instead, it stated that it would apply the same *principles* as for the allocation of costs in proceedings on the merits. These principles, enunciated in paragraphs 249 and 251 of the Resubmission Award, were that \"as a general principle, a successful litigant, whether claimant or respondent, ought to be protected against the cost and expense of having to litigate\" so that costs are allocated depending on the extent to which a party won or lost. This is what the Resubmission Tribunal did in its Rectification Decision, in allocating the costs against the Applicants because they failed in their challenges against Messrs. Berman and Veeder and the errors were devoid of practical relevance.\n\n793.\n\nTherefore, the request to annul paragraphs 58, 61 and 62(b) of the Rectification Decision is rejected.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n794.\n\nAs agreed at the Hearing on Annulment, the Parties filed their submissions on costs on 15 May 2019 and their response to the other Party\u2019s submission on 30 May 2019.\n\n795.\n\nThe Applicants request that the Committee order the Respondent to pay all of the costs of the Annulment Proceeding540 (including the costs relating to the Stay Request and other activities listed in the Submission on Costs,541 the translation of their briefs,542 the English interpretation and transcription of meetings, sessions and hearing).543 In the event the Annulment Application were to be dismissed, the Applicants request that the Committee order that each Party pay half of the annulment costs and bear its own legal costs.544 The Applicants seek compound interest (at a rate of 6-month \"LIBOR+4\" until actual payment) on the costs awarded.545\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 288.3; Memorial on Annulment, para. 759.2; Reply on Annulment, Section 13, para. 2.\n\nApplicants\u2019 Submission on Costs, pp. 2 ss., 12.\n\nApplicants\u2019 Submission on Costs, p. 12.\n\nApplicants\u2019 Submission on Costs, p. 13.\n\nApplicants\u2019 Submission on Costs, pp. 1, 11 ss.\n\nApplicants\u2019 Submission on Costs, p. 15.\n\n796.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Applicants be ordered to pay all of the costs of the Annulment Proceeding and reimburse the Respondent for all its legal fees and expenses plus interest (at a rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 2% per annum, from the date of the decision until the date of payment).546 In its Submission on Costs, Chile requests that the Applicants also reimburse it for the payment of the Live Note transcript in English at the First Session plus interest (at a rate of six month LIBOR plus 2% per annum from the decision to the date of actual payment).547\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 456; Rejoinder on Annulment, paras. 142(b) and (c); Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, paras. 1,3, 12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 16(b); *see also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 456(b).\n\n**A.

The Respondent\u2019s submission on costs**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n799.\n\nThe Respondent requests to be reimbursed of the following costs: (i) USD 1,315 (procedural costs related to the Live Note transcription in English of the First Session); and (ii) USD 2,061,596.92 (legal fees and expenses incurred by the Respondent and its representatives).549\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, paras. 16(b) and (c). Chile has indicated that the figure under (ii) is based on an estimate of the legal fees and expenses incurred in April 2019 and reserved its right to amend it in due course (see para. 13 and fn. 47).\n\n800.\n\nThe Respondent describes the costs above as follows (and provides further details on each figure in Tables A, Bl, B2, B3, and C attached in the Submission of Costs).\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type of Costs** | **Amount (USD)** | **Table** |\n| Procedural costs | 1,315.00 | A |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arnold & Porter\u2019s Legal Fees and Expenses | 2,054,731.80 | Tables B(1)-(3) |\n| Additional Expenses (Travel to Hearing) | 6,865.12 | Table C |\n| **Subtotal of Chile\u2019s costs, fees and expenses** | 2,062,911.92 |  |\n\n**C. The Committee\u2019s analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nThe costs of this Annulment Proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to USD 804,967.24:\n\nCommittee\u2019s fees and expenses:\n\nProfessor Dr. Rolf Knieper USD 254,236.79  \nProfessor Dr. Nicolas Angelet USD 134,416.87  \nProfessor Yuejiao Zhang USD 153,243.44  \nICSID\u2019s administrative fees USD 126,000  \nDirect expenses550 USD 137,070.14  \n**Total USD 804,967.24**\n\nThis amount includes actual charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision (printing, copying and courier).\n\n802.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e). The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicants.\n\n803.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides, in its relevant part, that:\n\nThe Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\n\n804.\n\nUnder this provision, applicable to this Annulment Proceeding by virtue of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has broad discretion in allocating the costs of the proceeding and the Parties\u2019 legal costs and expenses.\n\n805.\n\nThe Committee finds it appropriate to follow, in a broad brush, *mutatis mutandis,* the approaches of the two Tribunals as well as the consideration of the First Committee.\n\n806.\n\nThe Tribunals had applied the widely accepted principle that costs should follow the event by at the same time taking into account the specific circumstances of the case and the conduct of the Parties. The *ad hoc* Committee had recalled that \"[i]n most of the decisions of annulment committees, the committees have decided that each party should bear its own litigation costs and that the costs of the proceeding should be borne equally by the parties\" and had seen no reason \"to depart from the prevailing practice.\"551\n\nFirst Annulment Decision, paras. 352. 357 (footnotes omitted).\n\n807.\n\nOf course, the circumstances of the second annulment proceeding are specific and the result is not fully comparable to the previous phases and decisions.\n\n808.\n\nIt is true that the Applicants\u2019 Request for Annulment is rejected. At the same time, the application was far from frivolous, superficial or tainted by extraneous considerations. They had good reason to have an *ad hoc* committee scrutinise whether the Tribunal was properly constituted, whether the Award did not suffer from fundamental defects, whether the suspicion of bias had a basis in reality, and whether the propriety and integrity of the procedure were respected. In that respect, the remedy of annulment is important to guarantee the legitimacy and acceptability of the ICSID arbitration system.\n\n809.\n\nThe Committee has found that in the present case the Tribunal, the arbitrators\u2019 conduct and the Award were free from such flaws. Both Parties have greatly assisted the Committee to reach its conclusions, each one in its specific style and manner.\n\n810.\n\nTaken together, the Committee believes that it is fair to complement the \"cost follow the event\" principle by another principle of cost allocation according to which \"costs lie where they fall.\"\n\n811.\n\nBoth principles reinforce each other under the present circumstances: In accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e) the Applicants have advanced the costs of the proceeding, and the Parties have paid the legal costs and expenses.\n\n812.\n\nThe Committee decides that all costs and expenses should lie where they fall, meaning that the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee and the costs of the Centre are finally paid out of the advances made by the Applicants, and that each Party bears its own legal fees and expenses.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n813.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the *ad hoc* Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Application for Annulment of the Award is rejected;\n\n(2) Each Party bears its own costs and fees;\n\n(3) The Applicants bear the costs of the Annulment Proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee and the costs of the Centre;\n\n(4) The stay of enforcement is lifted."}]}
