INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this matter is Mr. Luigiterzo Bosca, a natural person of Italy. The Claimant brings his claims under the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Lithuania and the Government of the Italian Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 1 December 1994 (the \"Agreement\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Mr. Stuart H. Newberger and Mr. Ian A. Laird of Crowell and Moring LLP, 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, United States of America, by Mr. Ram\u016dnas Audzevi\u010dius of Motieka and Audzevi\u010dius, Gyneju} str. 4, LT - 01109 Vilnius, Lithuania, by Mr. Allan Gerson of AG International Law, PLLC, 2131 S St. NW, Washington, DC 20008, United States of America, and formerly by Dr. Pieter Bekker also of Crowell and Moring LLP.\n\n**2. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Lithuania.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented by Mrs. Vilija Vaitkut\u010d Pavan and Mrs. Inga Martinkut\u010d of LAWIN, Jogailos 9/1, LT - 01116 Vilnius, Lithuania, and by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Rosell, Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP, 8 Rue de Presbourg, 75116 Paris, France.\n\n**B. BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties arises from the Claimant's participation in the privatization of one of Lithuania's leading beverage producers, AB Alita (\"Alita\"), in 2003.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that, in contravention of the Agreement, the Respondent \"unilaterally, unjustifiably and unlawfully annulled the tender\" that had been awarded to the Claimant in October 2003.1\n\nNotice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 12.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent denies liability on both jurisdictional and substantive grounds. According to the Respondent, the Claimant made no qualifying investment, depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the Claimant's claim. Should the Tribunal conclude that it has jurisdiction, the Respondent contends that the Respondent acted in accordance with the Agreement.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration dated 19 March 2010, the Claimant commenced arbitral proceedings against the Respondent. The Notice of Arbitration also contains the Claimant's Statement of Claim in which the Claimant alleges that the Respondent \"caused substantial losses to [the Claimant] through expropriatory, unlawful, unfair, and discriminatory treatment in relation to the privatization process and illegal annulment of [the Claimant's] successful bid for [Alita], a leading Lithuanian beverage producer.\"2\n\nNotice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 1.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimant brings his claim pursuant to Article 9 of the Agreement and in accordance with Articles 3 and 18 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\" or \"Rules\").\n\n10.\n\nArticle 9 of the Agreement provides a mechanism for dispute resolution:\n\n1. Any dispute which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and the investors of the other Contracting Party on investments, including disputes relating to the amount of compensation, shall be settled amicably, as far as possible.\n\n(...)\n\n3. In the event that such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of the written application for settlement, the investor in question may submit at his choice the dispute for settlement to:\n\n(...)\n\nb) an ad hoc Arbitration Tribunal, in compliance with the Arbitration Regulations of the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The host Contracting Party undertakes hereby to accept the reference to said arbitration.\n\n**B. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 18 October 2010, the Claimant appointed Mr. Daniel M. Price, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator in the dispute.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 16 November 2010, the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as arbitrator in the dispute.\n\n13.\n\nThe two Party-appointed arbitrators selected the Honorable Marc Lalonde, a national of Canada, to serve as Presiding Arbitrator. The Presiding Arbitrator confirmed his acceptance of the appointment by e-mail to the Parties dated 17 January 2011.\n\n**C. PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1**\n-----------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 27 January 2011, the Tribunal held a teleconference with the Parties on procedural matters.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 7 February 2011, the Presiding Arbitrator summarized the matters discussed during the 27 January teleconference, noting the Respondent's intention to request bifurcation of the proceedings, deciding certain procedural matters such as the seat of arbitration, and inviting the Parties to confer on the topic of a submissions schedule.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 15 March 2011, the Parties circulated a letter and draft Procedural Order No. 1 reflecting the terms on which they agreed and others to be left to the determination of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nOn 6 April 2011, the Presiding Arbitrator held a teleconference with the Parties on outstanding matters surrounding the draft Procedural Order.\n\n18.\n\nAfter a further exchange of views, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 14 April 2011. Procedural Order No. 1 confirmed Stockholm, Sweden as the legal place of arbitration and English as the language of the arbitration. It also provided for a preliminary phase of pleadings to allow the Tribunal to consider a possible bifurcation of the proceedings. Further, Procedural Order No. 1 set alternative timetables with or without bifurcation for the submission of written pleadings, document requests, witness statements and expert reports, and for a hearing on merits and damages to be held at the Peace Palace in The Hague should one be necessary. It specified that the International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (\"IBA Rules\") would be followed \"as a guideline\" in the proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nBy e-mails exchanged in April 2011, the Parties and the Tribunal agreed that deposits payable in respect of this arbitration would be administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\"). By letter dated 18 April 2011, the Presiding Arbitrator confirmed the use of the PCA as Registry.\n\n20.\n\nOn 28 April and 2 May 2011, the PCA acknowledged receipt of initial deposits of EUR 150,000 each from the Claimant and the Respondent.\n\n**D. BIFURCATION PROCEEDINGS**\n------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 7 March 2011, the Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation and Summary of Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 July 2011, the Claimant submitted his Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages (\"Claimant's Memorial\"), accompanied by witness statements from the Claimant and Gintaras Skorupskas, as well as expert reports from Rudolf Dolzer, Valentinas Mikel\u00e8nas, Ariel Cohen, and Jos\u00e9 Alberro.\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 October 2011, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Respondent's Memorial\"), accompanied by witness statements from Miroslav Nosevi\u010d and Antanas Malik\u00e8nas, and expert reports from Robert Volterra and Andrius Smaliukas.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 3 November 2011, the Claimant argued that there were \"a number of serious irregularities in Respondent's filing of 30 October 2011.\" The Claimant contended that \"it is clear from this submission that Respondent's counsel, the LAWIN firm, has put itself in the untenable position of necessitating that it resign from this arbitration, and that Respondent will need to withdraw three of the four expert and witness statements provided in its filing.\" In light of what he alleged as a lack of impartiality on the part of the Respondent's witnesses and a conflict of interest on the part of the LAWIN firm, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to (1) strike from the record of the case the expert reports submitted by Dr. Smaliukas and Prof. Volterra; (2) strike from the record the witness statement of Mr. Nosevi\u010d; and (3) ask the LAWIN law firm to withdraw from the arbitration as co-counsel to the Respondent.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 10 November 2011, the Respondent commented on the Claimant's letter of 3 November. It argued that the expert reports submitted by Dr. Smaliukas and Prof. Volterra and the witness statement of Mr. Nosevi\u010d complied with the applicable procedural rules and therefore should be considered by the Tribunal. It also contended that LAWIN properly exercised its duties as counsel.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 11 November 2011, the Claimant remarked on the Respondent's letter of the previous day, reiterating his objections.\n\n27.\n\nBy e-mail dated 12 November 2011, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal strike from the record the Claimant's letter of 11 November and order the Claimant not to make any further submission without the Tribunal's prior permission.\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 November 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 addressing the matters in the Claimant's letter of 3 November 2011, stating:\n\nIII. The Tribunal has given careful consideration to the views of each party on these matters and rules as follows:\n\n(a) The Experts' Reports\n\n(i) As to Professor Volterra, the fact that, for a few months in 2010, he was called upon to advise the Government of Lithuania in connection with a completely unrelated matter cannot be a circumstance which would justify rejecting consideration of his expert's opinion in the present case. Claimant's request in this regard is dismissed.\n\n(ii) As to Dr. Smaliukas, Claimant's request concerning his expert's opinion is dismissed. However, the Tribunal points out that, taking into account the fact that Dr. Smaliukas is a partner in LAWIN, his appearance as expert, rather than counsel, in this case constitutes a highly unusual circumstance and his particular situation will be one which the Tribunal will very much bear in mind when considering his opinion.\n\n(b) The Fact Witness\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses Claimant\u2019s request concerning Mr. Miroslav Nosevi\u010d\u2019s testimony. Although it is not unheard of that a lawyer who is a member of a law firm acting in a case would appear as a fact witness in that case, it is equally highly unusual. Consequently, all the facts mentioned by Claimant and by Mr. Nosevi\u010d himself concerning his relationship with LAWIN and with Respondent will be borne in mind by the Tribunal when determining the weight it should attach to his written statement and his oral testimony before the Tribunal.\n\n(c) LAWIN\n\nClaimant\u2019s request concerning LAWIN is dismissed. The Tribunal does not believe that it has the authority to rule on the interpretation to be given to the ethical rules applicable to Lithuanian attorneys under Lithuanian law. The Tribunal does not believe either that the UNCITRAL Rules grant it the authority to challenge the choice of counsel by a party.\n\n29.\n\nOn 28 November 2011, the Claimant submitted his Reply to Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation and Summary of Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation (\"Decision on Bifurcation\") on 9 January 2012, denying the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n**E. RESPONDENT'S OCTOBER 2011 DOCUMENT PRODUCTION REQUEST**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn 10 October 2011, the Respondent submitted a Request for Production of Original Documents and Appointment of Independent Expert for Forensic Examination, in which it requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant:\n\n(1) (...) to present the evidences listed below, not later than 17 October 2011:\n\na) original of the Option Agreement, dated 2 July 2002, a copy of which is provided by the Claimant as Exhibit C-59 to its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages;\n\nb) original of the Contract of Buying-Selling Shares, dated 25 September 1997, a copy of which is provided by the Claimant as Exhibit C-57 to his Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages;\n\nc) original of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated 2 July 2002, a copy of which is provided by the Claimant as Exhibit C-58 to his Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages;\n\nd) original of the Service Providing Agreement, dated 11 September 1999, together with the Act of Provided Services, dated 31 December 2009, copies of which are provided by the Claimant as Exhibit C-24 to his Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages; and\n\n(2) to appoint the Swedish National Laboratory of Forensic Science (or other independent forensic examination body, competent to report on the age of documents) as an independent Tribunal-appointed expert to report on the question whether the original contracts requested to produce were signed more than two years ago by the Claimant and whether the signatures are genuine.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 20 October 2011, the Claimant commented on the Respondent's Request for Production of 10 October 2011, stating that he was unable to locate the original documents requested by the Respondent and therefore it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to address the matter further. The Claimant also asked that the Respondent be directed to \"make all future requests for documents in accordance with the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1.\"\n\n**F. RESPONDENT'S **D**ECEMBER 2011 REQUEST TO EXCLUDE **D**OCUMENTS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 12 December 2011, the Respondent submitted a Request to Exclude from Evidence Certain Documents submitted by the Claimant (\"Respondent's Request to Exclude\"), in which it asked the Tribunal to exclude the following four documents from evidence, arguing that a refusal by the Tribunal to do so would constitute a breach of fair and equitable treatment under the UNCITRAL Rules: an Option Agreement dated 2 July 2002; a Contract of Buying-Selling Shares dated 25 September 1995; a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 2 July 2002; and a Service Providing Agreement dated 11 September 1999, together with an Act of Provided Services dated 31 December 1999.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 19 December 2011, the Claimant commented on the Respondent's Request to Exclude, contending that the Respondent failed to establish grounds for exclusion and that it would be \"premature to respond\" to the Request. The Claimant also argued that the Request to Exclude was made in bad faith since the Respondent had recently relied on the same documents in a Lithuanian court.\n\n35.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, the Respondent submitted a reply to the Claimant's letter of 19 December 2011.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on 3 January 2012 concerning the Respondent's Request to Exclude. That Order provides in part as follows:\n\n6. In accordance with Clause 1 of Procedural Order No. 1 the arbitration is conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules, and the IBA Rules serve as a guideline.\n\n7. Both the UNCITRAL Rules and the IBA Rules grant to the Tribunal considerable discretion in addressing issues relating to evidence.\n\n8. As mentioned by Respondent, Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules (Article 17(1) of the 2010 revised text) requires the Tribunal to treat the parties with equality and to ensure that each party is given a reasonable opportunity to present its case. Moreover, Article 25(6) of those Rules (Article 27(4) of the 2010 revised text) provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.\"\n\n9. As to Article 9 of the IBA Rules, paragraph 1 repeats the same text as the UNCITRAL Rules just quoted concerning the admissibility and assessment of evidence and, in paragraph 2, it enumerates the reasons that a tribunal may invoke to exclude documents from evidence, production or inspection.\n\n10. In answer to a previous Request for Production of Documents by Respondent, Claimant produced photocopies of the documents in question and indicated that it could not find the originals of such documents. The Tribunal instructed Claimant to pursue its search for the originals.\n\n11. After a careful review of the arguments submitted by the Parties and exercising the authority granted to it under the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal is of the view that it would be premature to rule on the admissibility and, if admissible, on the weight to be attached to photocopies of the four documents mentioned above, in the absence of originals. This is a matter that the Tribunal should decide, once it has had an evidentiary hearing and a full briefing, including Respondent's rebuttal evidence and its crossexamination of Claimant's witnesses.\n\n12. The Tribunal is also of the view that there is no need, at this stage, to address the issue of the reference to those documents by Respondent in parallel proceedings before Lithuanian courts.\n\nTHEREFORE:  \nThe Tribunal dismisses as premature Respondent's Request to Exclude from Evidence Certain Documents Submitted by Claimant, dated 12 December 2011.\n\n37.\n\nAt the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Merits, and Damages, held from 3 September to 7 September 2012 (\"Hearing\"), the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would admit the documents in question, while bearing in mind that those in the record are copies only.3\n\nHearing Transcript 1329: 2-11.\n\n**G. RESPONDENT'S MAY 2012 DOCUMENT PRODUCTION REQUEST**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nOn 18 May 2012, the Respondent submitted a Request for Production in which it requested that the Tribunal order that the Claimant \"and/or Mr. Gintaras Skorupskas, as a witness,\" produce the following documents related to the shares' accounting documentation of UAB Boslita ir Ko (\"Boslita\"), a company incorporated in Lithuania by the Claimant and Dr. Skorupskas in 1998 as the vehicle for development of the Bosca brand in the region:\n\n1. in case of material shares - a copy of the shareholders' registration journal of Boslita for the period of the registration of the company until now;\n\n2. in case of dematerialized shares - a copy of the journal of transactions with Boslita shares together with the copies of shareholders' securities accounts for the period of the registration of the company until now;\n\n3. [a] copy of the shareholders' lists (for the period of the registration of the company until now) of Boslita;\n\n4. [a] list of the shareholders who attended the shareholders' meeting of Boslita held on 5 November 2001 (signed by the shareholders who then were present);\n\n5. [a] list of the shareholders who attended the shareholders' meeting of Boslita held on 30 June 2002 (signed by the shareholders who then were present).\n\n39.\n\nAfter the Parties' exchanged views in the form of a Redfern Schedule, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 dated 4 June 2012 in which it dismissed the Respondent's Request. The Tribunal concluded that \"UAB Boslita ir Ko is not a party to this case and the documents are not within the Claimant's control. Moreover, the Claimant has stated that, at his request, Mr. Skorupskas and his staff have carried out extensive searches for the Original Documents at Boslita's premises.\"\n\n40.\n\nBy letter dated 7 June 2012, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to reconsider its decisions regarding the Respondent's Request for Production of Documents 1, 2 and 3 in Procedural Order No. 4. The Claimant commented on the Respondent's 7 June 2012 letter on 11 June 2012.\n\n41.\n\nOn 13 June 2012, the Tribunal transmitted the following to the Parties:\n\nThe Tribunal, having considered the views of both Parties, finds that there has been no misunderstanding of the Respondent's Request.\n\nAs noted by the Parties and the Tribunal, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration serve as guidelines in this arbitration. Article 3(7) of these Rules provides that the Tribunal \"may order the Party to whom [a Request for Document Production] is addressed to produce any requested Document in its possession, custody or control as to which the Arbitral Tribunal determines that (i) the issues that the requesting Party wishes to prove are relevant to the case and material to its outcome (...).\"\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as stated in Procedural Order No. 4, there is no point in the present instance to asking the Claimant to again undertake a search for documents which are outside his control at the UAB Boslita ir Ko premises where Boslita is not a party to this dispute. The Respondent has not demonstrated how these documents are related to the \"alleged conclusion of the Option Agreement\" or the Claimant's \"[alleged] plans and possibility to make any decisions regarding the Boslita's merger with Alita\" nor has it stated why \"only diligent investigation of the data\" found in Requested Documents 1, 2, or 3 may \"confirm or deny Claimant's allegations.\" The Tribunal finds that Requested Documents 1, 2, and 3 lack sufficient relevance or materiality to warrant an additional request to Dr. Skorupskas as the Respondent has not shown what facts or allegations each document would establish, maintaining only that the documents are \"of crucial importance.\"\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's request for reconsideration with respect to Requested Documents 1, 2, and 3.\n\n**H. ADDITIONAL PRE-HEARING MATTERS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nOn 21 February 2012, the Claimant submitted an Amended Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim and explanatory letter. The Amended Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim included four amendments: (1) an updated date; (2) the inclusion of the Claimant's residences; (3) the removal of Dr. Bekker as counsel; and (4) an update to the quantum to be consistent with the amount in the Claimant's Memorial dated 29 July 2011.\n\n43.\n\nOn 26 March 2012, the Respondent submitted its Counter-memorial on Merits and Damages (\"Respondent's Counter-memorial\"), accompanied by an expert report by Brent Kaczmarek and a second expert report by Robert Volterra.\n\n44.\n\nOn 4 May 2012, the Claimant submitted his Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, Reply on Merits and Damages (\"Claimant's Counter-memorial/Reply\"), accompanied by further witness statements from the Claimant and Gintaras Skorupskas, as well as expert reports by Jos\u00e9 Alberro, Rudolf Dolzer, Valentinas Mikel\u00e8nas, and Rimantas Stanik\u016dnas.\n\n45.\n\nOn 15 June 2012, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction, Rejoinder on Merits and Damages (\"Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder\"), accompanied by witness statements from Antanas Malik\u00e8nas and Povilas Milasauskas, as well as a second expert report by Brent Kaczmarek.\n\n46.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested an additional deposit of EUR 150,000 from each Party. The Claimant's supplemental deposit was received on 31 July 2012. The Respondent's supplemental deposit was received on 5 August 2012.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant submitted his Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"Claimant's Rejoinder\") on 16 July 2012, accompanied by witness statements from the Claimant, Gintaras Skorupskas, and Arvydas \u010c\u00e8sna.\n\n48.\n\nIn accordance with Paragraph 6.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent submitted its Witnesses and Experts Notification for the Hearing on 19 July 2012. In its Notification, the Respondent stated:\n\nSince these proceedings have not been bifurcated, the Respondent considers that the place of the hearing should be Stockholm (*i.e.*, the place of arbitration as agreed in [Paragraph] 5(a) of the Protocol of the [Agreement] entered into by the Contracting Parties) for the reasons indicated during the telephone conference on April 6, 2011 and notwithstanding the conclusions reached by the Swedish Supreme Court in the RosInvest case of 2010.\n\n49.\n\nAt the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's Notification by letter dated 23 July 2012, objecting to the Respondent's suggestion that the hearing be held in Stockholm and referencing Paragraph 9.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 in which the Tribunal stated that the hearing on the merits, if any, would be held at the Peace Palace in The Hague. The Claimant subsequently submitted his Witnesses and Experts Notification on 30 July 2012.\n\n50.\n\nOn 8 August 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, stating:\n\n1. The Tribunal has had an opportunity to review the Respondent's Witnesses and Experts Notification dated 19 July 2012 in which the Respondent requested that the forthcoming hearing take place in Stockholm.\n\n2. It is recognized by the Parties and the Tribunal that the seat of arbitration is Stockholm.\n\n3. The Tribunal notes that, in its Procedural Order No. 1 of 14 April 2011, it has already ruled, after having heard the Parties on the matter, that the hearing, if any, on Merits and Damages would take place at the Peace Palace in The Hague, but that, if there were bifurcation of the case, it would consider the Respondent's request that the hearing on jurisdiction be held in Stockholm. By its Decision of 9 January 2012 on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, the Tribunal has ruled that there should be no bifurcation.\n\n4. In light of the above mentioned recent request by the Respondent, the Tribunal has once again examined the situation. It has come to the conclusion that, at this stage of the process and taking into account a number of logistical difficulties, it would not be appropriate to modify its previous decision.\n\nTHEREFORE:  \nAs previously decided, the forthcoming hearing shall take place at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, from 3 to 8 September 2012.\n\n**I. HEARING**\n--------------\n\n51.\n\nPursuant to Paragraph 9.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties on 17 August 2012 to discuss organizational matters relating to the Hearing in The Hague.\n\n52.\n\nFollowing the teleconference, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on 22 August 2012 in which it set out the agenda and schedule for the Hearing, the treatment of witnesses and experts as well as the nature of their examination (in particular, that the experts would be examined in \"conference\" fashion), and other logistical arrangements. The Tribunal also asked that the Respondent present Mr. Milasauskas in person, rather than by video-conference as requested by the Respondent in its Witnesses and Experts Notification.\n\n53.\n\nBy e-mail dated 23 August 2012, the Respondent asked that the Tribunal clarify its decision that experts Dr. Cohen and Prof. Stanikunas were not required to be present at the hearing, and that the Tribunal give the Parties instructions with respect to the order of topics to be addressed in the \"expert witness conferences.\"\n\n54.\n\nBy e-mail dated 24 August 2012, the Claimant commented on the Respondent's 23 August 2012 communication, noting that Dr. Cohen and Prof. Stanikunas had cancelled their plans to participate in the Hearing and rejecting the Respondent's suggested progression of topics for questioning the experts.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter dated 24 August 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties as follows:\n\nWith respect to Paragraph 4.1 [of Procedural Order No. 6], the Tribunal clarifies that it will not infer from the Respondent's decision not to cross-examine Dr. Ariel Cohen and Prof. Rimantas Stanikunas that the Respondent accepts their statements or reports as accurate, nor will the Tribunal infer that the Respondent does not contest their statements or reports.\n\nWith respect to Paragraph 5.4 [of Procedural Order No. 6], the Tribunal finds that expert conferencing need not follow a pre-determined subject-matter progression and leaves the substantive structure of the experts' cross examination to counsel. The Tribunal finds the Claimant's suggested format appropriate:\n\n- Presentation from Claimant's expert  \n- Presentation from Respondent's expert  \n- Respondent's cross-examination of Claimant's expert, with flexibility to enable \"conferencing\"  \n- Claimant's cross-examination of Respondent's expert, with flexibility to enable \"conferencing\"\n\nThis general format does not preclude the possibility for counsel for the Party that has produced an expert to subsequently address questions to that expert, nor for the Tribunal to do so at any time.\n\n56.\n\nBy e-mail dated 26 August 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that his fact witness, Mr. \u010c\u010dsna would not attend the Hearing.\n\n57.\n\nBy e-mail dated 27 August 2012, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal disregard the witness statement issued by Mr. \u010c\u010dsna in accordance with Article 7.4 of the IBA Rules.\n\n58.\n\nFollowing a teleconference held on 28 August 2012 between the Presiding Arbitrator and the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 dated 28 August 2012, providing an amended schedule of examination of witnesses as follows:\n\n1. Attendance of Mr. Art\u016dras Feiferas\n\n1.1 The Claimant having clarified the reason for Mr. Feiferas' attendance as a financial advisor to the Claimant's legal team and the Respondent having stated that it had no objection to his presence in that role, the presence of Mr. Feiferas at the Hearing is authorized in accordance with the agreement of the Parties.\n\n2. Statement of Mr. Arvydas \u010c\u010dsna\n\n2.1 In view of the Claimant\u2019s notification that Mr. Arvydas \u010c\u010dsna will not take part in the forthcoming Hearing on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages, and in accordance with Rule 4.7 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration which serve as guidelines in this arbitration, the Tribunal has determined to not take into account Mr. \u010c\u010dsna\u2019s witness statement tendered by the Claimant.\n\n2.2 The Tribunal has noted the Claimant\u2019s request to make a submission regarding Mr. \u010c\u010dsna\u2019s witness statement at the Hearing.\n\n59.\n\nFrom 3 September to 7 September 2012, the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague. The following persons were present:\n\n**The Tribunal**\n\nHon. Marc Lalonde  \nMr. Daniel Price  \nProf. Brigitte Stern\n\n**The Claimant**\n\nMr. Luigiterzo Bosca  \n*(Claimant)*\n\nMs. Pia Bosca  \n*(Claimant Representative)*\n\nMr. Stuart H.

POST-HEARING SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn response to an invitation made by the Tribunal during the Hearing, on 13 September 2012, the Claimant submitted evidence to show that Boslita paid the Claimant approximately EUR 470,000 for services provided by the Claimant under an alleged agreement the Claimant signed with Boslita in 1999.4\n\nSee paragraph 80, *infra*.\n\n63.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, the Claimant submitted an Update to Dr. Alberro\u2019s Second Expert Report as requested by the Tribunal at the Hearing.\n\n64.\n\nOn the same day, the Parties jointly proposed that their costs submissions would \"be submitted as separate documents, simultaneously with the submission of the post-hearing briefs, on 16 November 2012\" and that the costs would include: fees of the Tribunal; administrative costs; legal representation fees; experts\u2019 fees; and travel and accommodation expenses.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter dated 5 October 2012, the Tribunal approved the Parties\u2019 joint proposal for their costs submissions.\n\n66.\n\nBy e-mail dated 12 October 2012, the Parties submitted supplementary translations of the Lithuanian and Italian versions of Articles 1(2), 3(2) and 12(2) of the Agreement, with comments, as requested by the Tribunal at the Hearing.\n\n67.\n\nOn 18 October 2012, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested an additional deposit of EUR 100,000 from each Party. On 13 December 2012 and 20 December 2012, the PCA acknowledged receipt of supplemental deposits of EUR 100,000 from the Respondent and the Claimant respectively.\n\n68.\n\nOn 16 November 2012, the Parties transmitted to the Tribunal their respective post-hearing briefs and costs submissions.\n\n69.\n\nBy e-mail dated 21 November 2012, the Respondent requested and was granted permission to comment on the Claimant\u2019s Costs Application of 16 November 2012.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent subsequently submitted its comments on the Claimant\u2019s Costs Application on 28 November 2012.\n\n71.\n\nBy letter dated 10 December 2012, the Claimant submitted a copy of a Decision of the Supreme Court of Lithuania dated 5 December 2012 concerning the re-opening of the civil proceedings between the State Property Fund of Lithuania and the Claimant in the Lithuanian courts.\n\n72.\n\nOn 7 January 2013, the Tribunal invited the Parties to amend their cost submissions to reflect the December 2012 deposits that post-dated those submissions. On 18 January and 21 January 2013, the Respondent and the Claimant transmitted to the Tribunal their respective amended cost submissions.\n\n73.\n\nBy letter dated 14 April 2013, the Claimant submitted a copy of a Ruling of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania dated 2 April 2013 concerning the \"compliance of Resolution No. 903 of the [Lithuanian Government] \u2018on consent to the agreement regarding the draft amendment to the purchase and sale contract of the shares owned by the State in [Alita]\u2019 of 16 July 2004 with the [Lithuanian Constitution] and the [Law on Privatization of State-Owned and Municipal Property].\"\n\n**III. FACTUAL & LEGAL BACKGROUNDS**\n------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe following summary is drawn from the Parties\u2019 pleadings and is presented to give context to the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment as well as the Respondent\u2019s alleged violations of the Agreement. The Parties differ, however, with respect to the characterization of certain factual developments and their positions as to the relevance of those developments. The Parties\u2019 competing interpretations of the record are noted where applicable.\n\n**A. FACTUAL HISTORY & BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2005, the Claimant served as president of his family\u2019s Italian wine company known as Bosca Societ\u00e0 per Azioni (\"Bosca SpA\"), a well-known producer of *spumante*, Italian sparkling wine.5 The Claimant claims that the Bosca brand was popular in the Soviet Union until certain policy changes in the mid-1980s prevented its import behind the Iron Curtain.6\n\nBosca First Witness Statement, paras. 5, 6, 27.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 40.\n\n76.\n\nIn his pleadings and in his witness statements, the Claimant describes how, following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Bosca SpA sought new avenues to bring its products to the region. The company encountered difficulties after a period of initial success as the newly independent states developed strict policies inhibiting imports.7\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 41.\n\n77.\n\nBy 1996 and 1997, the Claimant, together with his local business partner, Dr. Gintaras Skorupskas, focused on potential opportunities for Bosca SpA in Lithuania. They created the Lithuanian company known as Boslita, producing almost exclusively Bosca SpA products.8\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 45. Bosca First Witness Statement, para. 36.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that he was personally involved in Boslita at several points in the company\u2019s history as detailed in the paragraphs that follow.9 Moreover, he argues that his transactions in the Baltic States throughout this period were part of a plan to produce Bosca-branded sparkling wine in the region and production capacity in Lithuania \"as a launch pad\" to regain prominence in other former Soviet markets, including principally Russia.10\n\nNotice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 23.\n\n79.\n\nBoslita, the first private alcohol company in Lithuania to be granted permission to produce alcohol up to 22 degrees, went into operation in 1997, prompting the Claimant to negotiate a License Agreement on 18 December 1997 (\"License Agreement\"), on behalf of Bosca SpA, to promote and sell the Bosca brand in the region.11 Under the License Agreement, Boslita was licensed to produce Bosca products in return for a five percent (5%) royalty.12\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 127.\n\nLicense Agreement, Exh. C-22, p. 3.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, from the time of Boslita\u2019s inception, he worked closely with Dr. Skorupskas to ensure its success. This relationship was \"formalized\" on 11 September 1999 when the Claimant personally signed a Service Providing Agreement with Boslita (\"Service Agreement\").13 In accordance with the Service Agreement terms, the Claimant maintains he provided extensive and valuable \"knowhow\" to Boslita between 2000 and 2009.14 The Claimant submits he also entered into an Option Agreement with Mrs. Loreta Skorupskien\u00e8 on 2 July 2002 (\"Option Agreement\") to purchase Mrs. Skorupskien\u00e8\u2019s thirty percent (30%) shareholding in Boslita as of 25 September 1997.15 The Respondent disputes the authenticity of the License Agreement, Service Agreement and the Option Agreement.16\n\nService Agreement, Exhs.

Respondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 324.\n\n82.\n\nThe State Property Fund (\"SPF\") was the State entity responsible for carrying out all Lithuanian privatizations at that time.19 Once the SPF\u2019s company-specific privatization program would be approved by the State\u2019s Privatization Commission,20 the SPF would make available for purchase a package of public tender documents, as provided in the applicable Regulations for the Privatization of State-Owned and Municipal Property by Public Tender (\"Tender Regulations\").21 Potential bidders would purchase the package, and submit to the SPF a bid for participation in the public tender together with supporting documents.22 The Public Tender Commission (\"PTC\"), a body established by the SPF, would evaluate the submissions by the bidders in a closed meeting and select a winning bidder.23 After the SPF approved the PTC\u2019s selection, the winning bidder would be invited to negotiate the terms of a draft share purchase agreement with the PTC.24 After the draft share purchase agreement was agreed between the PTC and the buyer, it had to be approved by the Privatization Commission and, if not approved by the Privatization Commission, the SPF could call upon the Government of Lithuania to make a final decision on the matter.25 Upon approval, the winning bidder would be invited to sign the agreement.26\n\nNotice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 20.

Respondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 16.\n\n86.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, three matters remained outstanding in the substance of the draft SPA by the end of September 2003: (1) whether there was to be a single payment or two installments; (2) whether the dispute settlement clause would name Stockholm or Paris as the place of arbitration; and (3) the level of fines.34 The Claimant contends that he was not willing to sign an agreement regarding which negotiations were incomplete.35 The Claimant also insists that he answered the enquiries of the SPF during the course of the tender process and did not provide false statements about his business activities in Lithuania.36\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 93.

After a year, the TIC issued its conclusions, determining that the decision to eliminate the Claimant from the tender had been illegal and had caused damage to the Claimant. The TIC also concluded that the decision to award the tender to the Executive Consortium was unlawful and cost the State \"at least LTL 34,150,000.\"56 The TIC recommended that the Seimas petition the Constitutional Court to examine whether the tender award had violated the Constitution and other laws of Lithuania.\n\nNotice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 52.

(...)\n\n**IV. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANT'S REQUEST**\n-------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant requests the Tribunal to:\n\n(1) declare that it has jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(2) declare that Lithuania has breached its obligations under the terms of the Agreement as described in the Claimant\u2019s Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim and in the Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder;\n\n(3) award monetary damages of not less than \u20ac207,971,00063 in compensation for loss sustained as a result of Lithuania\u2019s measures;\n\n(4) require Respondent to bear the costs and expenses of the arbitration, including fees and expenses of counsel, experts, consultants and witnesses, and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, plus such further costs and expenses as the Tribunal may find are owed under applicable law;\n\n(5) award pre- and post-award interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal; and\n\n(6) award such other relief that Counsel for Claimant may advise and that the Tribunal may deem appropriate.64\n\nAs updated in the Claimant\u2019s Brief, paras. 1, 165.\n\nAmended Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 80. Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 277.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S REQUEST**\n---------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) declare that the Claimant has breached the mandatory provisions of Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, notwithstanding the submission of an Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on 21 February 2012;\n\n(ii) declare that Claimant has breached the procedural pre-arbitral requirements provided for in Article 9 of the Agreement;\n\n(iii) dismiss the claims of the Claimant in their entirety as time-barred;\n\n(iv) declare that it has no jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claim;\n\n(v) render an award in favor of the Respondent and against the Claimant dismissing his claim in its entirety and with prejudice;\n\n(vi) order the Claimant to bear all costs of this arbitration, including in particular the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses, the costs and expenses of the counsels for the Parties, witnesses\u2019 expenses and the experts\u2019 fees and costs; and\n\n(vii) declare the Award as non-confidential and available in the public domain.65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, para. 168.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe following part summarizes the Parties\u2019 arguments on jurisdiction, merits and damages. The Tribunal has considered all of the Parties\u2019 submissions and details only those most relevant for its analysis here. The Tribunal\u2019s considerations that follow address the factors determinative to its decision.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to Article 9(3)(b) of the Agreement and Paragraph 5(b) of the Protocol which mandate that the arbitration shall be conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules and that the Tribunal shall apply the provisions contained in the Agreement as well as principles of international law recognized by the two Contracting Parties. In interpreting the Agreement, the Tribunal looks to the rules embodied in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Reference is also made, where appropriate, to the relevant provisions of Lithuanian law relating to the privatization process. While the Tribunal will occasionally draw upon the decisions of other arbitral tribunals, it is acutely aware of the specific terms of the Agreement that must be applied in the present case.\n\n**A. THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE **C**LAIMANT'S **C**LAIM**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent makes three arguments that the Claimant\u2019s claim is inadmissible. First, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim was invalid under the UNCITRAL Rules because it did not include the Claimant\u2019s address. According to the Respondent, Article 3(3)(b) of the Rules, which states that \"[t]he notice of arbitration shall include (...) (b) [t]he names and addresses of the parties,\" requires that the Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim identify the Claimant\u2019s address to be valid.66\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 163-166. Respondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 219-221.\n\n110.\n\nSecond, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant\u2019s claim is time-barred under the doctrine of extinctive prescription which, according to the Respondent, provides that a claim is inadmissible when it is delayed and such delay imparts actual prejudice to the Respondent.67 The Respondent argues that extinctive prescription dictates dismissal of a claim where, as here, (a) the Claimant\u2019s filing was \"unreasonably delayed\" without justification; (b) the delay was due to the Claimant\u2019s negligence; (c) a clear record of the case does not exist because of the delay; and (d) to allow the delayed claim to be tried on the merits would cause an unjust impairment of the Respondent\u2019s right to defend.68\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 210.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 147-162.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the Claimant\u2019s claim was unreasonably delayed because he was aware of the alleged breach as early as 2003 when the SPF decided to annul the tender results and because he did not challenge the SPF's decision while he had the right to do so under Lithuanian law.69 Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant's claim is time-barred due to a three-year statute of limitations with respect to claims for compensation of damages under the Lithuanian Civil Code.70 The Claimant's delay is negligent according to the Respondent because the Claimant \"failed to present any valid reason for withholding his claim\" until several years later.71 The Respondent argues that there is also a lack of clear record to the Parties' dispute as there is no privatization agreement between the Claimant and the Respondent and thus the Claimant bases his claim on pre-contractual events supported only by witness statements.72 Finally, the Respondent states that the delay creates an injustice by preventing it from preparing its defense insofar as relevant persons and related evidence are no longer available.73\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 151.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 152.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 155.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 156.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 160.\n\n112.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to comply with the pre-arbitration requirements provided for in the Agreement. The Respondent maintains that the Notice of Intent dated 21 February 2007 was not a \"proper written application for dispute settlement in accordance with Article 9.3 of the [Agreement]\" and that the Claimant has not acted in good faith in his intention to settle the dispute amicably before resorting to arbitration.74 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant failed to provide any information on the nature or grounds of his claims thereby preventing the commencement of amicable negotiations.75 The Respondent identifies statements made by representatives of the Claimant that the Claimant would \"make a settlement offer\" though he never did so.76\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 195.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 197.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 199-202.\n\n113.\n\nReferring to Article 9(1) of the Agreement, which provides that disputes \"shall be settled amicably, as far as possible,\" the Respondent maintains that prior amicable negotiations are mandatory before proceeding to arbitration.77 In this respect, the Respondent cites the Award on Jurisdiction in *Murphy International v. Ecuador* and the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Ecuador*, in which each of those tribunals concluded that non-compliance with pre-arbitration requirements set forward in the relevant treaty was sufficient to defeat the tribunal's jurisdiction.78\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 203-204.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 205, citing *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction (15 December 2010), para. 154; *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 June 2010), para. 315.\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant objects to the Respondent's assertion that his Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim did not comply with Article 3(3)(b) of the UNCITRAL Rules because it allegedly omitted his address.79 The Claimant contends that the Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim contained the address of his counsel, which is sufficient to meet the Rules' requirement.80 Pointing to the Decision on Bifurcation, the Claimant states that the Tribunal has already disposed of this issue by granting the Claimant permission to amend his Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, and that the Claimant has amended his Notice/Statement accordingly.81 The Claimant also argues that the Respondent has not suffered, nor is likely to suffer, any prejudice as a result of the omission or subsequent amendment.82\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 154, referring to Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 4.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 154.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 190-191, 194-195.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 192-193.\n\n115.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s timeliness argument, although the Claimant agrees with the Respondent\u2019s articulation of the test for extinctive prescription, the Claimant disagrees that the test is satisfied here.83 First, the Claimant argues that a delay, if any, is not \"unreasonable\" because it was caused by the Claimant\u2019s efforts to try to reach an amicable settlement with the Respondent.84 Second, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has not provided evidence to substantiate that the alleged delay was due to negligence on the part of the Claimant.85 Third, the Claimant objects to the Respondent\u2019s view that it lacks a clear record of the case, arguing that the Respondent should have been able to obtain necessary witness statements and also have access to any other necessary information.86 Fourth, the Claimant argues that the Respondent fails to prove that it has suffered prejudice due to the delay.87 Finally, the Claimant submits that the applicable law in these proceedings is the Agreement and principles of international law, and that statutory limitations under Lithuanian law do not apply to his claim.88\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 183.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 184-185.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 186.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 187-188.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 189.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 159-162.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that he has met all the pre-arbitration requirements of the Agreement and objects to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Notice of Intent was not in compliance with Article 9 of the Agreement.89 In the Claimant\u2019s view, Article 9 requires only filing an \"application for settlement\" that confirms the existence of a dispute and notifies the host State of the investor\u2019s intent to commence arbitration.90 The Claimant contends that his Notice of Intent satisfied this requirement.91 Even assuming that the Agreement required that a notice of intent include information about a settlement offer, the Claimant argues that the absence of a settlement offer would not defeat the admissibility of his claim.92 The Claimant adds that, in any event, the requirement is met in this arbitration because his Notice of Intent referred to his settlement offer.93\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 156.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 170-172.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 156-157.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 173-177.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 158.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n117.\n\nTurning first to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant\u2019s claim should be dismissed due to deficiencies in his Notice of Intent and Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant met the necessary requirements to bring a claim before the Tribunal. The Claimant fulfilled his procedural obligations under the law applicable to this arbitration, namely, the Agreement and principles of international law recognized by the two Contracting Parties,94 as well as the requirements of the applicable Rules. The Tribunal acknowledges the Respondent\u2019s view that Article 9 of the Agreement requires that disputes between an investor and a Contracting Party on investments \"shall be settled amicably, as far as possible,\" but considers that the Claimant met his burden in this respect. The Claimant substantiated that he made an attempt to settle the Parties' dispute prior to commencing arbitral proceedings as evidenced by his Notice of Intent. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant met his obligations to attempt to settle the dispute amicably as required by Article 9.\n\nProtocol, para. 5(b).\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal refers in particular to the Claimant's discussion in his Notice of Arbitration of a letter he sent to Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas and the Minister of Economy on 21 February 2007 in which he thanked them for informing him that they would \"make a settlement offer in connection with the State Property Fund's privatization of Alita\" and invited them to \"attempt to amicably resolve this dispute through negotiation and consultation pursuant to Article 9 of the BIT.\"95 There followed during the course of 2007 an exchange of several letters between the Parties, unsuccessful in resolving their dispute.96 Moreover, Dr. Skorupskas testified that he had raised this matter with the Prime Minister and other officials during the course of 2007 and subsequently.97 In the Tribunal's view, the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Claimant acted in bad faith. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the obligation to settle \"amicably as far as possible\" applies to both Parties and if, in the present case, the efforts at settlement appear to have been somewhat lackadaisical on each side, the Tribunal, on the basis of the evidence before it, is not inclined to put the blame on the Claimant only.\n\nNotice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim, para. 58; Notice of Intent from Luigi Bosca to the Prime Minister, Exh.

When appropriate, parties are afforded an opportunity to revise factual or procedural deficiencies in their pleadings. The Tribunal discussed the omitted address in its Decision on Bifurcation, following which the Claimant amended his Notice of Arbitration/Statement of Claim to include his address.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's arguments that the Claimant's claim should be time-barred. Contrary to the Respondent's assertion, the Claimant's claim is not subject to the Lithuanian statute of limitations. In accordance with the Agreement, the Tribunal applies international law, not Lithuanian domestic law, to these proceedings and there is no deadline prescribed by the Agreement, Rules or general principles of international law. Moreover, there was no requirement under the Agreement for the Claimant to initiate local proceedings against the SPF following the October 2003 Order annulling the tender results which removed the Claimant from the tender process (\"Annulment Order\"). The Tribunal considers that the Respondent was not prejudiced in its ability to respond to the Claimant's allegations due to any delay in the Claimant's commencement of the arbitration. The Claimant notified the Respondent of his intention to commence arbitration as early as 2007 when litigation in the Lithuanian courts relating to the Alita privatization was on-going. It was not unreasonable, in the Tribunal's view, to wait for those decisions to be rendered before undertaking a separate proceeding in an international setting.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes therefore that the Claimant's claim is admissible.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL**'S** JURISDICTION OVER THE **C**LAIMANT**'S C**LAIM**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIn evaluating the substance of the Parties' jurisdictional questions, the Tribunal turns to Article 9 of the Agreement which sets out the mechanism for dispute settlement between investors and the Contracting Parties. Article 9 provides that an investor, as defined in Article 1 of the Agreement, may submit a dispute \"on investments\" that he has with a Contracting Party to an ad hoc tribunal. The Tribunal first analyzes the Respondent's contention that the actions regarding which the Claimant complains are not attributable to the Lithuanian State before evaluating the presence of the other jurisdictional elements.\n\n**1. Attribution to the State**\n-------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the SPF, in annulling the tender results and entering into negotiations with the Executive Consortium, acted not as an arm of the Lithuanian State but as an \"ordinary commercial party conducting commercial negotiations.\"98 The Respondent maintains that the privatization of State-owned property in Lithuania is a civil transaction governed by the Lithuanian Civil Code.99 It distinguishes the circumstances here from those in *Eureko v. Poland* and *Lemire v. Ukraine* where the actions of certain individuals were attributed to the respondent State by noting that the SPF director who issued the Annulment Order was not a State official or minister of the Government, nor was he instructed by a State official as so happened in those two cases.100 It is the Respondent's position that the SPF acted *iure gestionis* rather than *iure imperii* and its actions cannot constitute a violation of the Agreement.101 Additionally, the Respondent submits that there was no interference by State officials with the Alita tender process, as confirmed by several witnesses.102\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 233.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 128.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 134-138, citing *Eureko B.V. v.

Hearing Transcript 660: 12 - 661: 8, 662: 1-17, 813: 23 - 814: 4, 854: 5-24.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent argues that by bringing a claim concerning the work of the SPF, the Claimant intends to elevate national law obligations to the level of international obligations and to extend the scope of the Agreement's protections to pre-contractual obligations as if the Agreement contained an umbrella clause, which it does not.103 Thus, according to the Respondent, without having proven all the elements of State responsibility for the actions of the SPF under the Agreement or international law more generally, the Claimant cannot sustain his allegations.104\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 139.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 143.\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is clear that privatization is an inherently sovereign act and that the entities responsible for privatization of a State entity are government agencies engaged in sovereign acts.105 The Claimant asserts that the privatization of Alita was clearly a \"sovereign act\" involving at least two Lithuanian State bodies: the SPF and the PTC.106\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 282.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 272, 276-279.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent's distinction between commercial and sovereign acts made by entities associated with the State is misplaced.107 First, the Claimant submits that the Respondent wrongly assumes that the distinction applies to all claims under international law; that is, the Respondent is wrong in suggesting that, for all claims, an act of *puissance publique* is required to establish a treaty breach. Rather, this principle applies only where a breach of contract forms the basis of a claim, which is not the case in the present arbitration.108\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 272, 282.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 274-275.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant comments that \"economic interests\" on the part of State actors involved in privatization do not change the sovereign nature of their actions.109 Moreover, many arbitral tribunals evaluating investment disputes have concluded that States can be liable for acts of their agencies or State-owned enterprises in the context of a privatization.110\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 280.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 281.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the actions of the SPF and its related entities are attributable to the State. According to Article 3.1 of the Law on the SPF, the SPF is a state enterprise, having a separate legal personality, the object of which is to privatize State property. The Respondent relies on the Lithuanian courts\u2019 observation that the privatization process is governed by the Lithuanian Civil Code; on this basis, the Respondent asserts that the SPF acted in a commercial capacity. The Tribunal disagrees. The SPF is an entity empowered to exercise governmental authority, as described in Article 5 of the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility (the \"ILC Articles on State Responsibility\").111 Thus, the question before the Tribunal is whether the SPF was acting in a sovereign capacity in the privatization process. While the privatization process is governed in part by the Lithuanian Civil Code, as argued by Respondent, it is also controlled through the Law on Privatization, the Regulations under it and even the Lithuanian Constitution. The evidence presented by both Parties confirms that the privatization process is a governmental process, highly regulated by a series of governmental decrees and rules, culminating in a multi-step State-approval process.112 The applicability of the Civil Code to certain aspects of the SPF\u2019s work does not change the governmental nature of the acts adopted in the process of privatization.\n\nResponsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83, 12 December 2001.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, the Tender Regulations - a governmental decree issued as part of the Law on Privatization of State-Owned and Municipal Property, Exh. R-2. Hearing Transcript 255: 23-24, 718: 1-23, 737: 1-3, 954: 6 - 955: 20. Following the announcement of the tender winner, the Government\u2019s discretion to cancel the privatization transaction became subject to the specific limitations established in Article 63 of the Tender Regulations. Claimant\u2019s Brief, para. 34.\n\n128.\n\nRegardless of whether the Tribunal considers the SPF to have acted in a sovereign capacity, the SPF\u2019s actions were vetted and in this case approved by higher authorities that clearly acted in sovereign capacities. The Privatization Regulations make clear that the Privatization Commission and, in the case of its refusal, the Government itself could be called upon by the SPF to make a final decision on a proposed SPA;113 the stamp of sovereign involvement could not be clearer. The Tribunal considers that this administrative evaluation further reflects the governmental endorsement of the process. Here, the Government acted at multiple steps, projecting its sovereign authority.114\n\nTender Regulations, Exh. R-2, Arts. 45, 46, 48.\n\nThe Tribunal notes also that in accordance with the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, \"[c]onduct which is not otherwise attributable to a State shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\" See Article 11. In other words, where the State endorses the act, as here, the State is subject to international responsibility under international law.\n\n129.\n\nHaving established that the Claimant properly brings his claim against one of the Contracting Parties, the Tribunal now turns to a second jurisdictional element: whether there is a dispute \"on investments\" as set out in Article 9 of the Agreement.\n\n**2. Whether the Claimant made an \"investment\" under the Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s position that the Claimant made no investment under the Agreement and that, therefore, there is no dispute \"on investments\" under Article 9. Neither the Claimant\u2019s activities prior to the Alita privatization nor his participation in the tender constitutes an \"investment\" as defined by Article 1 of the Agreement. The Respondent also notes that the Parties have not concluded a contract and that the Claimant has not contributed any of his own funds to the alleged investment.\n\n(a) Activities prior to the Alita privatization\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that any activities of Bosca SpA and those of the Claimant with or through Boslita are irrelevant to the Alita tender.115 Even if these business activities were relevant, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant\u2019s and Bosca SpA\u2019s alleged activities with Boslita do not qualify as \"investments\" under the Agreement.116\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 22-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 25.\n\n132.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s assertions that Bosca SpA \"made a tangible and substantial financial investment\" through (1) the conclusion of the License Agreement, (2) Bosca SpA\u2019s acquisition of equipment for Boslita, or (3) Bosca SpA\u2019s alleged minority shareholding.117 The Respondent maintains that none of these constitutes \"investments\" under the Agreement. The Respondent further objects that any of the activities of Bosca SpA can be attributed to the Claimant.118\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 32.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 27-28. Respondent\u2019s Brief, para. 10.\n\n133.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the License Agreement that the Claimant alleges he signed in 1997 was never registered with Lithuanian authorities as required by law, calling into question its validity.119 Moreover, the Respondent doubts in its pleadings that the License Agreement was put into effect as the Claimant did not provide any admissible evidence that he was paid any royalties in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement.120 In any event, the Respondent maintains that the License Agreement does not qualify as an investment under the Agreement and that the activities under the License Agreement are attributable to Bosca SpA and not to the Claimant.121\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 33.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 40.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the equipment acquisition to which the Claimant refers as a contribution of Bosca SpA to Boslita (and an investment) was a basic purchase agreement and not an investment.122\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 32, 40.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that evidence regarding Bosca SpA\u2019s shareholding in Boslita is contradictory and unreliable to support the notion that Bosca SpA\u2019s activities vis-\u00e0-vis Boslita constitute an investment.123\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 29-31.\n\n136.\n\nTurning to the Claimant\u2019s activities in his personal capacity, the Respondent argues that the Option and Service Agreements cannot by themselves constitute an \"investment.\" Beginning with the Service Agreement, the Respondent maintains that it has justifiable doubts as to whether the Service Agreement existed in 1999.124 Moreover, the Respondent contends that the alleged \"transfer of know-how\" as outlined in the Service Agreement does not satisfy the necessary conditions of \"investment.\"125 Insofar as the Claimant argues that his work under the Service Agreement constitutes \"associated activities\" as defined by the Protocol, the Respondent argues that \"associated activities\" must be connected with an already existing investment of the Claimant, and the Claimant\u2019s activities under the Service Agreement are not so connected.126 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Service Agreement is \"an ordinary contract for the supply of services\" rather than a protected investment.127 Further, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s personal activities under the Service Agreement, if any, would not have been compatible with his fiduciary duties to Bosca SpA.128 The Respondent also raises due process concerns with respect to the evidence of payments made under the Service Agreement, stating that it was not disclosed until the Hearing.129 Finally, the Respondent points out that Prof. Dolzer, the Claimant\u2019s expert, agreed at the Hearing that the Respondent did not interfere with the Claimant\u2019s activities under the Service Agreement.130\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 42.

Hearing Transcript 1104: 16 - 1105: 17.\n\n137.\n\nWith respect to the Option Agreement, the Respondent argues that it does not constitute an investment under the Agreement because, first, the Option Agreement lacks certain features that are typical to an investment, *i.e*., \"duration, regularity of profit and return, risk, substantial commitment and contribution to the host State\u2019s development.\"131 Second, it does not contribute to the prosperity of both Contracting Parties, contrary to the object and purpose of the Agreement.132 In any event, it is the Respondent\u2019s position that the Option Agreement, if it is an authentic document from 2002, is null and void under Lithuanian law.133 The Respondent notes that the Claimant agreed at the Hearing that he had paid no consideration for rights under the Option Agreement nor had he exercised those rights.134\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 58, citing *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (23 July 2001), [*hereinafter Salini v. Morocco*, Decision on Jurisdiction], para. 52.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 55-59.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 54.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, para. 11, citing Hearing Transcript 142: 14-20, 294: 2-4.\n\n(b) Continuous investment\n-------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s participation in the Alita tender does not constitute a \"continuous investment\" meeting the requirements of Article 1 of the Agreement. To begin, the Respondent reasserts that the Claimant never provided any information regarding his prior commercial activities in Lithuania when prompted by the SPF on several occasions to do so.135 Further, any link between the Claimant\u2019s participation in the Alita tender and his alleged activities prior to the tender is, according to the Respondent, \"speculative and distant.\"136\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 65-67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 70.\n\n(c) Participation in the privatization\n--------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nNext, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s premise that his participation in the tender, including through the payment of fees related to the tender or any rights arising in the course of the tender negotiations, constitutes an investment under the Agreement. With respect to the fees, the Respondent states that the Claimant did not incur any costs for the Alita tender application fee of LTL 5,000 (EUR 1,448.10) nor for the deposit of LTL 200,000 (EUR 57,924) as these were paid by third parties outside the control of the Claimant and have been reimbursed by the Respondent.137 The Respondent argues that these expenses do not entail contribution, risk or duration, characteristics usually attributable to an investment, and do not result in \"economic rights accruing by law\" as provided for in Article 1(1)(e) of the Agreement.138 Likewise, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has not shown why the fee paid to receive informational documents should be considered an investment.139\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 22, 25, 72-73.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 77-79.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 169.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimant's transfer of his initial deposit constitutes neither \"shares\" nor the \"making of [a] contract[]\" as defined by the Agreement.140 In this regard, the Respondent objects to the Claimant's allegation that the deposit \"form[s] part of the total price to be paid for shares,\" arguing that under the Tender Regulations, the deposit could be set-off against the price of the SPA only after the closure of the SPA.141 Additionally, the Respondent maintains that under Lithuanian law, the deposit paid by the Claimant was not a \"payment\" for Alita shares but rather \"security\" in favor of the SPF.142 The Respondent disputes the Claimant's suggestion that, once the Claimant was announced as the winning bidder, his deposit became a contribution to equity. According to the Respondent, such a position is in contradiction with the Tender Regulations; the announcement of the winner does not change the nature of the deposit.143\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 74-76.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 170-174.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 80-82.\n\nRespondent's Brief, paras. 37-39.\n\n141.\n\nWith respect to any rights arising from the Claimant's participation, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's expectations that the SPA would be finalized do not constitute \"economic rights accruing by law\" because the \"economic rights\" are \"implicitly restricted to the rights arising out of laws similar to administrative permits, concessions, and licenses\" and do not include the rights arising out of general good faith duties in pre-contractual relations.144 The Respondent argues that the statutory obligation to negotiate in good faith does not create a right to demand that the other party conclude the contract.145 Relatedly, the Respondent submits that statutory rights of a general nature enjoyed by the Claimant during the negotiations do not qualify as \"associated activities\" under the Protocol because the phrase \"making (...) of contracts\" must be understood to refer not to the conduct of contractual negotiations but to the actual conclusion of binding contracts.146 Even if they did, the Respondent maintains that the \"associated activities\" under Paragraph 1 of the Protocol do not fall within the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(1) of the Agreement.147\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 84-85, 89-95. In the Respondent's view, the Claimant's expert oversimplifies the meaning of \"economic rights\" by suggesting that they are rights connected with \"economic process\" or \"economic matters.\" According to the Respondent, this interpretation is not supported by practice in\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 22, 25, 103-108.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 22, 25, 86-88.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 114-120, 186-188.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's behavior, including his failure to cooperate with the SPF in the last stage of finalization of the SPA, led the SPF to believe that the Claimant had no serious intention to finalize the Alita deal.148 The Respondent asserts that the SPF had the right to terminate the Alita tender negotiations because the negotiations were not \"advanced,\" or, even if they were \"advanced,\" it had an adequate reason for doing so on the basis of the Claimant's non-participation.149 international investment arbitration.

Peru* and *Eureko* to support his position that the question for the Tribunal is not whether any one of the Claimant\u2019s transactions, when viewed in isolation, is sufficient to confer jurisdiction but whether the Claimant\u2019s interest in concluding the acquisition of Alita, as demonstrated through all of his activities, \"\u2018forms an integral part of a transaction which qualifies as an investment.\u2019\"165 Additionally, the Claimant argues that \"Paragraph 1 of the Protocol expressly provides that the protections in the Agreement apply to activities associated with investment\" and that his participation in the Alita tender aimed at expanding his existing investment in Lithuania clearly constituted an \"associated activity.\"166\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 139-147, citing *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v.

Czech Republic*, *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, and *Bureau Veritas v. Paraguay*, arguing that \"all forms of labor and in-kind contributions are equally capable of giving rise to an investment subject to treaty protection in certain contexts\" and that, therefore, the services provided by the Claimant under the Service Agreement could give rise to a protected investment for the purpose of the Agreement.177\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 131.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 179-189, citing *CME Czech Republic B.V. v.

Here, however, the Claimant had business operations in Lithuania prior to pursuing the Alita tender.190 Thus, the Claimant argues an \"overall investment operation\" had commenced.191 The Claimant submits that the fact that his participation in the Alita tender was \"intimately related\" to his pre-existing activities in the Lithuanian alcoholic beverages sector was confirmed at the Hearing.192\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 159-161, citing *Generation Ukraine Inc. v.

Sri Lanka*, relied on by the Respondent because the expenses incurred by the investor in **Mihaly** were not connected to the tender process, but rather were the expenses the investor accumulated through its own development of the project.196 Moreover, the **Mihaly** tribunal was careful to limit its decision to the facts and noted that it was not concluding that all pre-contractual expenditures were barred from consideration in other circumstances.197 Regarding the Respondent\u2019s position that the deposit was not attributable to the Claimant as an investment belonging to him because it was paid by a third party, the Claimant contends that this detail is irrelevant as the payments were made \"at the direction of the Claimant.\"198\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 140.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 155.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 156.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 210.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 208-209, quoting *Mihaly International Corporation v.

Claimant\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 197-198.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal will first comment on the relevance of Lithuanian court decisions concerning matters related to the privatization process of Alita. The Respondent is right in arguing that, as discussed further below, factual findings by local courts do not have precedential value for an international investment tribunal and are not relevant to the question of whether the Claimant has made an investment within the terms of the Agreement, a matter that in any event no Lithuanian court has been called upon to address. However, their irrelevance in this respect does not mean that the Tribunal should completely ignore those decisions, as if they had never occurred. In fact, the Respondent itself has not hesitated, as noted in paragraph 146 of this Award, to refer to such a decision in support of its claim that the SPF sought to act legally in the Alita tender. The Tribunal is clearly not bound by any local court judgment but it must take them as facts which, together with other evidence submitted by the Parties, must be considered by the Tribunal in determining, on the basis of the Agreement and international law, whether the Claimant has made an investment and whether the Respondent has breached the Agreement. In reaching its determination, the Tribunal need not rely on the findings of the Lithuanian courts, though it finds them informative for understanding the domestic law provisions and their meaning and application to the circumstances.\n\n164.\n\nIn its consideration of whether there is a \"dispute (...) on investments\" in the present proceedings, the Tribunal observes that there is clearly a dispute between the Parties according to the plain meaning of the term and that that dispute concerns the Respondent\u2019s retraction of the Claimant\u2019s winning bid in the Alita tender process. The Parties have presented several arguments outlined above as to whether the elements of the Alita tender process, and the Claimant\u2019s other commercial activities in Lithuania, constitute \"investments\" such that the dispute may be considered to be a \"dispute (...) on investments\" giving the Tribunal jurisdiction according to the Agreement.\n\n165.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal observes that nothing in the Agreement distinguishes a dispute \"on investments\" from one \"arising out of or relating to\" investments. The Agreement defines \"investment\" in Article 1(1) as \"any kind of property invested (...) by a natural or legal person of a Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\" The Tribunal concentrates on the meaning of \"investment\" and its extension to associated activities as described in Paragraph 1 of the Protocol. As noted by the legal experts for the Claimant and the Respondent, the Agreement, including its Protocol which is \"deemed to form an integral part of the Agreement,\"210 contains a very broad definition of what constitutes an investment. Prof. Dolzer states that, \"[t]he scope of the term \u2018investment\u2019 so defined in the main text and the Protocol is unusually broad by any standard of investment law.\"211 Prof. Volterra opines that, \"[a]lthough Article 1 of the BIT indeed contains a broad definition of \u2018investment,\u2019 and possibly the broadest, it is not \u2018unusually broad.\u2019\"212 The Tribunal does not believe that there is a significant difference between an \"unusually broad\" and \"possibly the broadest\" definition of \"investment.\"\n\nProtocol, opening paragraph.\n\nDolzer First Expert Report, paras. 11-12, 41.\n\nVolterra First Expert Report, para. 12.\n\n166.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant made an investment in Lithuania when he concluded and realized the Service Agreement. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, winning the tender in the Alita privatization and negotiating the SPA - the subject of the present dispute - was an associated activity, as described in Paragraph 1 of the Protocol, subject to the same protection as any investment falling within Article 1 of the Agreement. The Tribunal need not decide whether the Agreement allows it to take jurisdiction over disputes concerning activities in advance of the establishment of an investment since it finds that the Claimant had an investment at the relevant time and that the disputed activity was associated with it in such a way as to bring it under the protection of the Agreement\u2019s substantive provisions.\n\n167.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is of the view that the activities of Bosca SpA in Lithuania in the late 1990s including the License Agreement with Boslita and Bosca SpA\u2019s minority shareholding between 1997 and 2002 did not constitute investments of the Claimant for purposes of this arbitration. Thus, the Tribunal need only focus on the Claimant's activities in his personal capacity.\n\n168.\n\nIn that context, it is clear that the Claimant was devoting resources to a commercial venture in Lithuania with the expectation of profit as early as the time of the Service Agreement vis-\u00e0-vis Boslita. The Tribunal considers that the Service Agreement is more than an \"ordinary contract for the supply of services\" as the Respondent suggests.213 Weighing the totality of the evidence submitted by the Parties, such as the list of services the Claimant provided under that Service Agreement, his many trips to Lithuania during the relevant time, his testimony and that of Dr. Skorupskas to that effect, the Tribunal determines that the Service Agreement constituted an investment as defined in the Agreement and the Protocol. Despite the difficulties highlighted by the Respondent concerning the execution, authenticity, and realization of the Service Agreement, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has substantiated his contributions to Boslita under the Service Agreement as well as the payment he received in return for his services, albeit only recently.214 In particular, the Tribunal is left with no doubt that the Claimant contributed considerable know-how to Boslita during the duration of the Service Agreement and knowhow is specifically mentioned in Article 1(1)(d) as one form of investment under the Agreement. The Service Agreement had the necessary elements of contribution, risk and duration typically considered basic characteristics of an investment.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 51.\n\nOnly at the Hearing did the Tribunal hear for the first time that the Claimant was receiving payments under the Service Agreement. Hearing Transcript 155: 25 - 159: 4. The Respondent has highlighted many \"discrepancies\" with respect to the authenticity of the Service Agreement and when it was signed. See, *e.g*., Hearing Transcript 539: 22 - 540: 10. The Tribunal will address the Respondent's further arguments on the evidentiary nature of the Service Agreement and others of the Claimant's transactions again below. See para. 318 of this Award.\n\n169.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent's argument that the Option Agreement does not constitute an investment. In contrast with the Service Agreement where he was to receive remuneration, the Claimant admitted that he paid no consideration for \"rights\" under the Option Agreement nor had he exercised those rights at the time of the Option Agreement's expiration in 2007. Nothing in the Agreement, either in its definition of investment in Article 1 or in its definition of associated activities under Paragraph 1 of the Protocol, would cover this Option Agreement under these circumstances. In any event, no claim is made in connection with the Option Agreement. The Tribunal's only interest in that event is that it brings some support to the Claimant's alleged desire to expand his presence and activities in Lithuania during the period covered by the present dispute but it has no bearing on the Tribunal's conclusion on this point.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the Claimant has not substantiated any argument that the Respondent interfered with his Service Agreement investment. The Claimant's claim in the present arbitration concerns only the Respondent's treatment of the Claimant in the course of the Alita tender to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimant's interest and participation in the Alita tender followed the establishment of the Boslita brand in Lithuania through the License Agreement signed between Boslita and Bosca SpA in 1997 and his own Service Agreement of 1999 with Boslita. Subsequently, the Claimant sought to expand the venture, pursuing another opportunity to grow the presence of Bosca products in the Baltic States. To do so, the Claimant embarked on the acquisition of Alita, making the required payments and preparing appropriate materials until, having offered a purchase price about double those of the other bidders, he was declared the winner of the tender and would thereafter negotiate the final terms of the SPA with the State.\n\n172.\n\nThese activities gave the Claimant a solid foundation to build upon his investment through an associated project. Looking to the Protocol to the Agreement, which includes among its provisions examples of \"associated activities\" to be treated as investments, the Tribunal concludes that becoming the tender winner and negotiating the SPA can be likened to \"making [a] contract[].\" Thus, the Tribunal finds that these activities between the Claimant and the SPF constitute an \"associated activit[y]\" granting the Tribunal jurisdiction over the Claimant's claim. Applying for and winning the tender led the Claimant to the contract-negotiating table. The Tribunal notes in particular that, when they were terminated by the SPF, the negotiations were at an advanced stage in which only three terms remained for discussion, two of them already agreed between the Parties\u2019 representatives but still subject to confirmation by the Claimant. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the culmination of the tender process announcing the Claimant as the winner and commencing the negotiation of the SPA falls within the express terms and intended meaning of an associated activity.\n\n173.\n\nThe Service Agreement did not need to contemplate the acquisition of Alita for the tender process to constitute an associated activity. In the absence of an express definition of \"associated,\" the Tribunal considers that activities are associated through their common purpose, aims, and operation. The Claimant\u2019s monetary contributions, despite their later reimbursement by the State following a decision by the Supreme Court of Lithuania ordering such reimbursement, demonstrated the seriousness of purpose the Claimant brought to the table; the status of those contributions, whether considered as a down payment or otherwise, has no bearing on the characterization of the Claimant\u2019s on-going activities.\n\n174.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimant has not contributed any of his own funds to the alleged investment because the monetary contributions for the tender process were paid by third parties, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has demonstrated that these sums were advanced at his direction and on his own behalf.215 That these sums were later reimbursed by the Respondent at the order of the Supreme Court may be something to be considered by the Tribunal when assessing damages but it does not change the fact that these amounts must be considered as having been made on behalf of the Claimant; at no time during the negotiation process did the Respondent raise any question in that regard.\n\nBosca First Witness Statement, para. 43; Skorupskas First Witness Statement, para. 37; Cash Receipt No. 835856336, 1 April 2003, Exhs. C-27/R-45; Transaction details for initial contributions to AB Alita on behalf of L. Bosca, 2 May 2003, Exhs. C-28/R-46.\n\n175.\n\nNeither Party disputes that the Parties were in the process of negotiating a contract. Winning the tender set the Claimant apart from the other bidders allowing him to commence the contract-making process. The Respondent insists that the reference to \"making [a] contract[]\" means to include only the signature of a contract surrounding its entry into force. The Tribunal is not convinced by this interpretation. Rather, the Tribunal understands the term in its context in the Protocol, \"the making, performance and enforcement of contracts,\" to be less restrictive than the Respondent proposes. Nothing in the Agreement or in its Protocol suggests that the drafters intended \"making\" to be so limited.\n\n176.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s argument concerning the alleged failure of the Claimant to provide information of essential importance, the Tribunal is satisfied by its analysis of the relevant documents produced by the Parties and the testimony given at the Hearing that the Claimant responded adequately to the Respondent\u2019s queries at the time of his investment and did not intentionally conceal his business activities.216 The Tribunal will further address this issue below.\n\nHearing Transcript 441: 25 - 442: 12.\n\n177.\n\nFinally, there is the question whether the Claimant acquired an economic right accruing by law, as mentioned under the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(1)(e) of the Agreement. This question does not concern any guarantee on the part of the Claimant that the SPA would be concluded; rather, it concerns whether he had an investment under the terms of the Agreement by having a right to expect that the Respondent would meet its good faith negotiation obligations. The Tribunal sees no need to take up this issue given the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Claimant already had an investment and that his participation in the negotiations also received protected status pursuant to the Agreement.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes only that the Claimant made an investment under the Agreement in the form of the Service Agreement and that his participation in the negotiations after winning the Alita bidding process constituted an associated activity under the Protocol of the Agreement.\n\n**3. Alleged termination of the Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in light of concerns the Republic of Italy had as to the compatibility between the Agreement and EU law and \"being aware of the Claimant\u2019s claim and possible abuse of the [Agreement],\" the Contracting Parties to the Agreement decided to terminate it upon the expiration of its 15-year term, *i.e.*, on 15 April 2012.217\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 194.\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the documents offered by the Respondent on this point do not support its argument and that the argument is frivolous.218\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 112.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the Agreement was terminated on the basis of the evidence provided: a Note Verbale to the Republic of Lithuania in which the Italian Republic merely sought the views of the Republic of Lithuania.219 In its response, the Republic of Lithuania does not agree to annul the Agreement, but rather reiterates the Agreement\u2019s validity.220 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s assertion is undermined by the plain text of the correspondence between the Contracting Parties.\n\nNote Verbale from the Republic of Italy to the Republic of Lithuania, dated 21 August 2007, Exh.

JUST AND FAIR TREATMENT**\n------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n183.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the obligation on the Contracting Parties in the first sentence of Article 2(2) of the Agreement to \"ensure just and fair treatment of the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party\" should be construed in the same way as the obligation found in many bilateral investment treaties to provide \"fair and equitable treatment\" (\"FET\"). The Claimant asserts that FET is understood to incorporate a requirement that States act consistently with an investor\u2019s \"legitimate expectations.\"221\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 165-166, 168, citing *Total S.A. v.

Poland*, in which the tribunal stated that \"[the respondent\u2019s] arbitrary and unlawful disregard for the extant strategy and policy (...) by necessity\" violated an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations of investment expansion.228\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 169-175.

It asserts that any expectation on the part of the Claimant that the SPA would be concluded based on the announcement of the Claimant as the tender winner cannot be described as objective, reasonable and legitimate and would not give rise to a claim under the Agreement.241 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the SPA negotiations did not create any specific rights that could justify legitimate expectations, nor did the general legal framework surrounding the tender process create such expectations.242\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 156-159.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 237.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent argues that legitimate expectations must be based on \"a specific assurance or a promise of a State\"243 and that no specific assurances were given here with respect to the conclusion of the SPA.244 The Claimant\u2019s pre-contractual right was \"neither specific nor explicit or enforceable enough to generate legitimate expectations.\"245 The Respondent differentiates the *Tecmed v. Mexico* case, in which the tribunal found that the State violated the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations, on the basis that, there, the investor had the necessary permit to invest which gave rise to its expectations, whereas no legitimate expectations had arisen here through the negotiation process.246 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant gained only \"the right to be invited to negotiate the SPA prior to other bidders.\"247\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 158.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 159-166.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 239-240, 243-248.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 167-168.

Respondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 260-262.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin with the following preliminary comments.\n\n196.\n\nThe expression \"just and fair treatment\" is used in the first sentence of Article 2(2) of the Agreement but, as the Parties have accepted, there is no reason to consider that it has a different meaning from \"fair and equitable treatment\" found in many investment treaties and arbitral awards. Thus, the Tribunal will treat \"just and fair treatment\" as having the same meaning as FET. The same conclusion has been reached in a number of awards addressing similar terms.253\n\n*Total v. Argentina*, Decision on Liability, para. 106; *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, Award, para. 277.\n\n197.\n\nSecondly, it is worth repeating that the Tribunal is not bound by the conclusions of the Alita Commission. Other than the occasional reference, in light of the political nature of that Commission, the Tribunal will not consider the Commission\u2019s conclusions in reaching the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n198.\n\nNor is the Tribunal bound by the decisions of the Lithuanian courts on the subject, as discussed above, even though due deference should be given to such decisions, particularly when they interpret Lithuanian law. In the *Helnan v. Egypt* case,254 the arbitral tribunal stated that, when a tribunal is considering an issue of domestic law previously ruled upon by a domestic court, the tribunal \"will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies, in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice.\" No such inappropriate conduct by the local courts has been alleged in the present case; the Lithuanian courts appear to have applied high standards of judicial propriety in each of their judgments.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award (3 July 2008), para. 106.\n\n199.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal is called upon to address the issues raised by the present dispute under the provisions of the Agreement, international law and, where the Agreement refers to local laws, Lithuanian law. For this reason, a breach of the privatization process under domestic law does not, without further analysis, constitute a breach of the Agreement. The Tribunal has to base its conclusions on the substantive provisions of that Agreement. As stated in Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, \"[t]he characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\"255 The ad hoc committee in the *Vivendi* case put it this way: \"[a] state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and *vice versa*.\"256\n\nResponsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83, 12 December 2001.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment (3 July 2002), para. 95.\n\n200.\n\nFinally, in the same way, the decision of the Supreme Court of Lithuania of 7 June 2011 to the effect that the former Director General of the SPF, Mr. Milasauskas, was not guilty of a criminal act does not rule out the possibility that the Respondent, through the SPF, breached the Agreement. As stated by the Supreme Court, \"[a]buse of office is a premeditated crime\" involving intent to abuse one\u2019s office and knowledge that one\u2019s actions \"might cause huge damages to the State.\"257 In analyzing whether a State or one of its agents breached a substantive provision of an investment agreement, an arbitral Tribunal does not refer to the same criteria as those that apply in domestic criminal law.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, Criminal Case No. 2K-292/2011, Exhs. C-47/C-62/R-85, p. 5.\n\n201.\n\nUpon review of the evidence and submissions produced by the Parties, the Tribunal concludes that, in the present instance, the Respondent has breached its obligation of just and fair treatment contained in the Agreement.\n\n202.\n\nThe breach in question here is not a breach of a contract (which the Claimant himself recognizes never came into existence)258 between the Claimant and the SPF. It rather results from the breach of the Claimant\u2019s rights by virtue of the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the privatization of Alita including when viewed in the context of the relevant provisions of the Lithuanian Civil Code (particularly Articles 6,159 and 6,163) and of the Law on Privatization of the State-Owned and Municipal Property of the Republic of Lithuania (\"Privatization Law\") and Tender Regulations (particularly Articles 20-21 of the Law259 and Articles 38-60 of the Regulations).260\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 41.\n\nPrivatization Law, Exh. R-1.\n\nTender Regulations, Exh. R-2.\n\n203.\n\nAfter having been declared the winning bidder of the privatization of Alita on 26 June 2003,261 the Claimant was entitled to good faith negotiations262 toward an SPA with the SPF, carried out according to law. In his bid of 7 May 2003,263 the Claimant, who offered by far the highest price for the purchase of Alita, also proposed three terms which differed from those of the standard SPA issued to bidders by the SPF.264 He wished to pay the purchase price in two installments rather than one lump sum, to name Paris as the place of arbitration rather than Lithuania, and to see the penalties for breach of the SPA reduced from one hundred percent (100%) to one percent (1%) of the purchase price. From the moment of the bid\u2019s acceptance, the Parties were bound by the provisions of the Civil Code to pursue their negotiations in good faith.\n\nMinutes No. 6 of the PTC, Exhs. C-31/R-25.\n\nArticle 6,163 of the Civil Code, Exh. RLA-36.\n\nDraft SPA provided by the Claimant, Exh. R-13.\n\nStandard draft Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, Exh. R-8; Draft SPA provided by the Claimant, Exh. R-13.\n\n204.\n\nThe Tribunal finds telling that, when accepting the Claimant\u2019s bid on 26 June 2003, the PTC approved his bid without expressing any reservation while it was surely aware of the conditions the Claimant had introduced in his bid. On that occasion, the PTC decided \"[a]s a result of the assessment of the tenders and their respective specifications and clarifications delivered by the buyers (...), to recognise Luigiterzo Bosca the winner of the public tender for privatisation of (...) Alita.\"265\n\nMinutes No. 6 of the PTC, Exhs. C-31/R-25.\n\n205.\n\nSimilarly, in its letter of 30 June 2003 to Dr. Skorupskas announcing the winner of the public tender,266 the SPF simply invited him to a meeting for \"preparation of the draft agreement on sale-purchase of the shares (...),\" without any indication that the conditions noted by the Claimant in his bid could be an obstacle to the conclusion of the SPA.\n\nAnnouncement of the Winner of the Public Tender sent by PTC Chairman Antanas Malik\u010dnas to Gintaras Skorupskas, Exhs. C-32/R-26.\n\n206.\n\nThe minutes of the subsequent meeting of the PTC on 8 July 2003 with the Claimant, Dr. Skorupskas and Jonas Saladzius, a Lithuanian lawyer representing the Claimant, indicate that it was decided that \"the Buyer and the representatives of the State Property Fund deal with the issues raised during the sitting and inform the other side about possible resolution and results thereof.\"267 But, according to the minutes, the only issue raised on that occasion relating to the conditions put forward by the Claimant in his bid concerned the Claimant\u2019s intention to make the payment of the purchase price in two installments; he appears to have been asked merely if his intentions had changed in that respect and told that, if not, a bank guarantee would be required. The other matters addressed during the 8 July meeting dealt with the aim to reach an agreement by early August, the timing of a shareholders\u2019 meeting of Alita, the advisability for the Claimant to submit a notification to the Competition Council and the issuance of a press release.\n\nMinutes No. 10 of the PTC, Exhs. C-44/R-29.\n\n207.\n\nWhile the draft SPA subsequently transmitted to the Claimant by the SPF did not include the conditions laid out by the Claimant, one would have expected that, if these conditions were matters that the Respondent could not accept, the Respondent would either have rejected the Claimant\u2019s bid or, at least, indicated that these three conditions were matters of concern that should be the subject of further negotiations.\n\n208.\n\nAgain, according to the minutes of a meeting between representatives of the Claimant and the PTC on 11 July 2003, only the Claimant\u2019s method of payment, an update of the information about Alita and the Claimant\u2019s preparation of documents for the Competition Council were discussed.268\n\nMinutes No. 11 of the PTC, Exhs. C-45/R-30.\n\n209.\n\nThe Parties have advised the Tribunal that negotiations took place during the course of the summer but it is only in the minutes of the 26 August 2003 meeting between the PTC and representatives of the Claimant (these representatives refused to sign the minutes alleging that they were inaccurate) that the issue of the fines and the place of arbitration are mentioned.269 It appears to have been stated on that occasion that the PTC \"disagreed to reduce the fines stipulated in the draft agreement presented to the Buyer.\"270 On the other hand, the Claimant\u2019s representatives indicated that they would consider the possibility of satisfying the purchase price in a single payment and the Respondent agreed to consider the Claimant\u2019s proposal that the place of arbitration be Paris.\n\nMinutes No. 20 of the PTC, Exhs. C-46/R-32.\n\nMinutes No. 20 of the PTC, Exhs. C-46/R-32.\n\n210.\n\nAssuming that the minutes of 26 August 2003 constitute a reasonable summary of the discussions which took place and even accepting the reservations expressed in that respect by the Claimant\u2019s representatives, it would be fair to conclude that, by that time, the only point of significant disagreement between the Parties had to do with the issue of fines which remained unresolved at the time of the annulment of the Claimant\u2019s tender on 14 October 2003.\n\n211.\n\nIn his witness statement commenting on a meeting of 8 September 2003 with Dr. Skorupskas and Mr. Saladzius, Mr. Nosevi\u010d alleges that, on that occasion, \"all unresolved issues were closed and the draft SPA in the Lithuanian language, which provided for payment of the whole purchase price in one instalment, was finally coordinated.\"271 It is interesting to note that, in the minutes, no mention is made of the issue of fines, an issue that was clearly much more contentious and important to each Party than whether the payment of the purchase price was to occur in one or two installments.\n\nNosevi\u010d Witness Statement, para. 48.\n\n212.\n\nBoth Parties recognize that there was no obligation on either of them to eventually sign an SPA which did not meet the conditions each of them had set out. However, once the Claimant had been selected as the winner of the tender, both were bound by the Lithuanian Civil Code to carry out negotiations toward an SPA in good faith272 and the Claimant had legitimate expectations that, if the SPF abided by the Privatization Act and the Tender Regulations, he would eventually initial an SPA. He could further expect that that signed SPA would then be subject to confirmation by the PTC and, if the PTC refused such confirmation, the SPF could then refer the matter to the Government for a final decision.273 The SPF was thus under an obligation to pursue the negotiations through the process established under the Regulations; this obligation implied that the SPF needed to propose final terms, after having sought the input of the Claimant on the outstanding issues, and to have the result recorded in the minutes of negotiations, thus formally concluding the negotiations on the basis of those terms. The Claimant\u2019s limited communication during this period did not relieve the SPF of its legal obligations in this respect.\n\nArticles 1.5, 6.4, 6,158 and 6,163 of the Civil Code, Exh. RLA-36.\n\nDecree 1502, Article 46 of the Tender Regulations, Exh. R-2.\n\n213.\n\nUnfortunately, the PTC and the SPF decided to short-circuit the privatization process. On 10 October 2003, the PTC proposed to the SPF \"to cancel the results of the public tender and to adopt respective decisions regarding the further course of privatization of AB Alita,\"274 even though the PTC was made aware that there were still outstanding issues to be finalized. On 14 October, the SPF issued the Annulment Order, annulling the award of the tender on the basis of the Claimant\u2019s failure to initial the draft SPA and authorizing the PTC \"to conduct negotiations with the second place winner of the public tender.\"275\n\nMinutes No. 24 of the PTC, Exhs. C-48/R38, p. 2.\n\nAnnulment Order, Exhs. C-37/R-39.\n\n214.\n\nThe Lithuanian Supreme Court, reviewing many of the same facts as in the present case, concluded in its 2006 judgment, that \"the negotiations for the preparation of the draft [SPA] for initialling were disrupted due to unlawful actions of the [PTC] and that the [Claimant] was eliminated from the negotiations without a sufficient reason (without reaching agreement on the payment procedure). Such behavior on the part of the [PTC] undermined the [Claimant\u2019s] reasonable trust and lawful expectations that the [SPA would] be concluded.\"276 The Supreme Court then ruled that the SPF \"exercised its right to annul the results (...) in an inappropriate and unfair manner\" and that \"the actions of the [PTC] were unjustified and unfair.\"277\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, Civil Case No. 3K-7-470/2006, Exh. C-1E, p. 13.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, Civil Case No. 3K-7-470/2006, Exh. C-1E, p. 14.\n\n215.\n\nIt would be conceivable for the Tribunal to conclude nonetheless that the failure by the PTC and the SPF to fully abide by the procedure set in the Privatization Law and the Tender Regulations, while illegal under Lithuanian law, does not give rise to a breach of \"just and fair treatment\" or of the FET standard. A procedural illegality does not inevitably result in a breach of the substantive provisions of an investment treaty under international law. Evaluating whether there has been a breach of the FET standard requires a fact-specific analysis; on these facts, the Tribunal concludes a violation must entail more than a simple procedural misstep.\n\n216.\n\nHowever, a number of circumstantial events from September 2003 to the end of that year lead the Tribunal to conclude that it is faced with more than a mere procedural error.\n\n217.\n\nThere is, first of all, a letter of 2 September 2003 from the SPF inviting the Claimant to initial the draft SPA on 4 September and acknowledging that \"a few non-material items of the agreement remained for coordination.\"278 While it is true that, according to the draft SPA sent to the SPF on the Claimant's behalf on 28 August 2003 by Mr. Saladzius, the Respondent appeared willing to move the place of arbitration to Stockholm and the Claimant was ready to pay the purchase price in a single payment, (the negotiators for each side still needed confirmation from their principals), there still remained the issue of the fines that could be imposed in case of a breach of the SPA investment undertaking. All three conditions had been made part of the Claimant's bid, declared by the PTC to be the winner of the public tender, and remained present in his application materials when that action was approved by the SPF on 30 June 2003.\n\nLetter from PTC Chairman Antanas Malik\u00e8nas to Gintaras Skorupskas, Exh. R-33.\n\n218.\n\nEven though it was recognized by both sides that there remained matters to be negotiated, the Claimant had legitimate expectations that none of the conditions he had set in his bid would be insurmountable obstacles to the conclusion of the SPA. The same conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of Lithuania when it declared in its 10 October 2006 judgment that \"the principle of good faith requires that any negotiations in which considerable progress has been reached are not disrupted without a sufficient reason. The prohibition on disruption of negotiations in which considerable progress has been reached is explained by the fact that, in such negotiations, a party has reasonable grounds for believing that the intentions of the other party are serious and that the agreement will be concluded for certain.\"279 As mentioned above, if the Respondent's representatives had severe reservations concerning the conditions attached to the Claimant's bid, they should, at least, have made them clear when approving the Claimant's bid. While the issues of the arbitration venue and the method of payment appeared to be nearing resolution by the end of August, it is more than strange for the SPF to state in its 2 September 2003 letter that only \"a few non-material items of the agreement remained for coordination.\" In an earlier email of 25 July 2003 to Mr. Saladzius, Mr. Nosevi\u010d had simply stated: \"the decision on the sizes of amounts/penalties/interest payable on delay will be made by the representatives of the Commission of the Public Tender.\"280 And it is only in the minutes (contested by the Claimant's representatives) of a 26 August 2003 meeting between the PTC and the Claimant's representatives that the first indication that the PTC \"disagreed to reduce the fines stipulated in the draft agreement presented to the Buyer\" appears.281 The Claimant was fully entitled up to that time to assume that his condition on fines would be either accepted or reasonably compromised. On 2 September 2003, a letter was sent to the Claimant inviting him to initial two days later a draft SPA which contained no change at all by the Respondent to the 100% level of fines.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, Civil Case No. 3K-7-470/2006, Exh.

On the occasion of that meeting, according to the minutes, Mr. Brazauskas instructed the SPF to submit a certificate prepared by officers of the national law enforcement authorities concerning the Claimant's reliability as an investor.282 Nonetheless, Mr. Milasauskas testified that the meeting was about the economic impact of the Alita privatization and its consequences for Lithuania.283 It is unusual, to say the least, that, taking into account the alleged objective of the meeting, the participants should be the head of the security service and the police commissioner and not officials of departments dealing with economic matters.\n\nMedia Article: *Aldona Jankauskien\u00e8, Buyer of Alita Did Not Succeed in Appeasing the Mayor of Alytus,* LIETUVOS RYTAS, Exh.

On that occasion, the Claimant stated that there remained open issues in the negotiations. Mr. Milasauskas made no attempt to insist that the Claimant initial the draft SPA nor did he raise the question of the relations between Bosca SpA and Boslita or with the Claimant's tender. According to Dr. Skorupskas' testimony, it was agreed that \"we have to carry on with the negotiations and to finalize a few outstanding issues.\"284 There is some disagreement between the versions of events as reported by the Claimant and Dr. Skorupskas, on the one hand, and Mr. Milasauskas,285 on the other. However, on the basis of the evidence submitted to the Tribunal, including the protocols for witness interrogations of Dr. Skorupskas and Mr. Saladzius taken in the course of Lithuanian court proceedings in 2007 and 2009,286 the Tribunal is satisfied that the versions given by the Claimant and his colleagues are more reliable.\n\nHearing Transcript 550: 6-11.

That letter followed previous phone conversations between these two persons at the end of September.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal has already referred to the 10 October decision of the PTC and the Annulment Order of the SPF of 14 October 2003.\n\n226.\n\nStrangely enough, on the very same day as the SPF's Annulment Order, the second and the third competing bidders jointly notified the PTC that they were no longer interested in participating in the further public tender for Alita, stating they had each found other opportunities for their capital.287\n\nIn his Memorial (para. 72), the Claimant mentions that, on 1 October 2003, the two bidders \"communicated to the SPF and to the Privatisation Commission in writing about their further decision concerning participation in the privatisation of Alita.\" However, the Claimant has not produced any document in that regard. The information seems to have been taken from the \"Conclusions of the Ad Hoc Investigation Commission of the Seimas Formed for the Investigation of the Circumstances of Privatisation of Alita\" which mentions that event but which also does not produce any document in support of that statement. Exh. C-2, p. 3.\n\n227.\n\nOn 17 October, the Director General of the SPF wrote to the Claimant, formally informing him that the SPF had annulled the tender results on the basis of the Claimant's failure to initial the SPA.288\n\nLetter from the SPF Director General Povilas Milasauskas to Luigi Bosca, dated 17 October 2003, Exhs.

On 10 November, an SPA was initialed and sent to the PTC which approved it on 27 November. That agreement contained some minor modifications to the issue of fines, in spite of the previous position of the SPF toward the Claimant to the effect that the matter was non-negotiable.290 Alita was sold for 73.4 percent of the price offered by the Claimant.\n\nArticle 16, paragraph 1 of the Law and Article 35 of the Tender Regulations, Exh.

These events nonetheless comfort the Tribunal in its decision that the actions of the Respondent vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimant during September and October 2003 constituted a breach of Article 2(2) of the Agreement concerning just and fair treatment and that the Respondent is liable for the damages resulting from such behavior. The legitimate and reasonable expectations of the Claimant resulting from his selection as the winning bidder were illegally frustrated by the Respondent\u2019s authorities.296\n\n*Saluka v.

UNJUSTIFIED OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant also maintains that the Respondent subjected the transformation, use, and enjoyment of the Claimant\u2019s investment to unjustified and discriminatory measures in violation of the first sentence of Article 2(2) of the Agreement by dismissing him from the tender and proceeding to execute the SPA with a more politically connected local investor, the Executive Consortium.297 In interpreting the phrase \"unjustified or discriminatory measures,\" the Claimant points to the more commonly used terms \"arbitrary or discriminatory measures\" and \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\" found in other bilateral investment treaties.298 The Claimant submits that \"arbitrariness\" is regularly construed to refer to an abuse of authority or abuse of discretion, as defined under customary international law, on the part of a respondent State.299\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 163.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 190.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 195-197.\n\n237.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s position that the SPF abused its authority by dismissing his bid and ending negotiations before the SPA could be finalized and by failing to afford the Claimant due process.300 According to the Claimant, the SPF, the Claimant\u2019s representative, and Mr. Malik\u00e8nas were all in agreement that the SPA had not been fully and finally negotiated when the tender result was cancelled.301 The Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s justifications that the negotiations were terminated due to his lack of cooperation, stating that not only was he willing to participate and that his representatives readily participated on his behalf, but that he also demonstrated he had access to ample funds.302 Rather, the Claimant argues, the SPF did not do what it could do, in good faith, to complete the negotiation of the SPA with the Claimant.303 The Claimant also points to the fact that the SPA negotiations froze after Mr. Milasauskas met with Prime Minister Brazauskas on 8 September 2003.304\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 200.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 130.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 126.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 133.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, paras. 141-142.\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the SPF\u2019s conduct during the tender negotiations process was discriminatory because it dismissed the Claimant from the tender process without any reasonable justification.305 In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s conclusion of an SPA with the Executive Consortium on the basis of what it asserts were its local political connections is not only arbitrary but also overtly discriminatory.306 The Claimant also argues that the SPF\u2019s actions in respect of the Executive Consortium reveal the illegitimate nature of the SPF\u2019s motivations that constitutes an independent basis for concluding that its actions were arbitrary.307 The Claimant asserts that, in the absence of any reasonable justification for selecting the last place bidder, the SPF\u2019s failure to maintain adequate or appropriate records during the tender process further supports the Claimant\u2019s position that the SPF acted with bias.308\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 212.

By law, the SPF had to complete the Alita privatization by the beginning of 2004 and the Executive Consortium was the only bid that remained. The SPF sought professional legal advice on the matter and was advised to select the Executive Consortium rather than open a new tender.312\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 82.\n\n241.\n\nTo evaluate whether a measure is discriminatory toward a foreign investor, the Respondent looks to the standard adopted by the tribunal in *Saluka v. Czech Republic*. There, according to the Respondent, the tribunal concluded that a respondent State must provide a rational justification for any differential treatment.313 Here, the Respondent maintains that the SPF was justified by the business and legal circumstances at the time to select the Executive Consortium when it believed the Claimant was unable or unwilling to conclude the SPA.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 191, citing *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award, para. 460.\n\n242.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not proven any discriminatory intent on the part of the SPF or any other entity.314\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 213.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n243.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the Agreement provides in its first sentence that \"(b)oth Contracting Parties shall at all times ensure just and fair treatment of the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.\" The second sentence adds that \"management, maintenance, use, transformation, enjoyment or assignment of the investments effected in their territory by investors of the other Contracting Party, (...) shall in no way be subject to unjustified or discriminatory measures.\"\n\n244.\n\nIn light of its conclusion above based on the just and fair treatment clause in the first sentence of Article 2(2), the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide whether the Respondent violated the Agreement under the second sentence. Any additional breach is not relevant unless it leads to additional damages, which it would not do here.\n\n**E. NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n-------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent violated Article 3(1) of the Agreement by affording his investment less favorable treatment than it afforded that of the Executive Consortium when it granted the Consortium the tender after previously having awarded it to the Claimant.315 The Claimant argues that this difference in treatment constitutes a denial of national treatment under the Agreement.316\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 221, 248.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 240-241.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award (16 December 2002), para. 169.\n\n246.\n\nCiting *Pope and Talbot v. Canada*, the Claimant maintains that once a claimant has \"made a *prima facie* showing of less favorable treatment, the respondent State must \u2018justify\u2019 the difference by showing that the treatment has been implemented pursuant to a rational, non-discriminatory government policy.\"317 Other arbitral tribunals have likewise concluded that differences in treatment are presumptive violations of national treatment obligations but the presumption may be rebutted by the State if it \"produces sufficient evidence that the treatment in question has a reasonable basis in rational, non-discriminatory government policies.\"318\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 229-231, citing *Pope and Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Interim Award (26 June 2000), paras. 78-79.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 244.\n\n247.\n\nArguing that the construction of Article 3(1) does not require the Tribunal to evaluate the likeness of circumstances between the relevant comparators as some tribunals have done under different treaties, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent violated its national treatment obligation when it accorded less favorable treatment to the Claimant\u2019s objectively superior bid than to the bid of the Executive Consortium, a domestic comparator.319 Upon comparison, however, the Claimant maintains that he was similarly situated to the Executive Consortium.320\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 240, 247.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 251. Claimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 245, referring to *Pope and Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL/NAFTA, Award on the Merits of Phase 2 (10 April 2001), [*hereinafter Pope and Talbot v. Canada*, Award], para. 78; *S.D. Myers, Inc. v.

Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Award (27 October 2006), para. 130.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent has not presented a legitimate reason for treating his investment differently than it treated the domestic investor\u2019s bid. The reasons given by the Respondent in the domestic litigations were rejected by the Supreme Court, by the Alita Commission, and by the Constitutional Court.321\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 249.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, in the Claimant\u2019s view, Article 3(1) of the Agreement provides an obligation to afford national treatment not only to \"investments\" but also to \"activities associated with those investments\" as set out in Paragraph 1 of the Protocol.322 Thus, according to the Claimant, not only does his tender payment fall within the scope of Article 3(1), but so does his participation in the negotiations surrounding the SPA, which qualifies under the Protocol as an activity undertaken in furtherance of his pre-existing investments in Lithuania.323\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 225-226. Claimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 241-243.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 227.\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Respondent violated the \"national treatment clause\" of Article 3(1), arguing that (1) the clause does not apply to the Claimant\u2019s participation in the Alita tender and (2) even if the clause were applicable, the Claimant failed to prove that his participation was subject to less favorable treatment than a similarly situated domestic investor.324\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 195.\n\n251.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the national treatment obligation under Article 3(1) does not apply to the Claimant\u2019s participation in the Alita tender because the Claimant did not make an investment as defined by the Agreement. Article 3(1) does not envisage protection for the pre-contractual stage of a planned investment.325 The Respondent argues that \"making (...) of contracts\" under the list of associated activities qualifying as investments named in the Protocol refers to a \"right accruing from [a] signed and binding contract\" and not the contract negotiation process.326 In any event, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to establish that it was \"making [a] contract.\"327\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 197-200.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 281.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 284.\n\n252.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that, even if Article 3(1) is applicable, the Claimant\u2019s claim still fails because the Claimant and the Consortium were not similarly situated and therefore cannot be compared. Referring to the analyses of other arbitral tribunals reviewing national treatment claims, the Respondent maintains that a similarly situated domestic comparator must be produced to be successful with a national treatment claim.328 Here, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the Consortium was not situated similarly to the Claimant because the Consortium provided proof of sufficient funding as required with its bid and proposed providing its payment in one installment, making it a \"safer\" bid than the Claimant\u2019s.329\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 201.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 202-204.\n\n253.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant was granted \"not less, but more favorable treatment than the Consortium\" in that the Claimant was declared the winner of the tender.330 The Claimant did not follow through with the necessary steps to finalize the SPA and secure his acquisition.331 The Respondent also submits that the Claimant\u2019s allegations that the SPF was more flexible in negotiations with the Consortium than it was in those with the Claimant are not supported by the facts.332\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 206-207.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 209.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, paras. 110-111.\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that, as the tribunal in *Noble Ventures v. Romania* found, to prevail on a national treatment claim, the Claimant must show that the measure taken by the Respondent was \"directed specifically (...) by reason of [the Claimant\u2019s] nationality.\"333 According to the Respondent, the SPF terminated the negotiations based on \"rational policy considerations\" and did not have any intentions to harm the Claimant.334\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 212, citing *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award (12 October 2005), para. 180.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 211, 213-214. Respondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 290-292, 294.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n255.\n\nIn light of its conclusion above based on the just and fair treatment clause, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to reach a determination concerning the Parties\u2019 arguments on national treatment. The Claimant would not in any event be entitled to greater relief than for the Respondent\u2019s breach of the just and fair treatment clause discussed above; accordingly, the Tribunal will not examine the alleged breach of the national treatment clause.\n\n**F. MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT**\n------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n256.\n\nAs an alternative to his argument under Article 3(1) of the Agreement, the Claimant submits that the Respondent violated Article 3(2)\u2019s most-favored-nation (\"MFN\") treatment obligation by failing to extend to the Claimant the same treatment it is obligated to afford to United States investors with regard to new investments under Article II of the Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (\"US-Lithuania BIT\").335\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 221.\n\n257.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Articles II(1) and II(3)(b) of the US-Lithuania BIT provide more favorable treatment than the present Agreement in that the US-Lithuania BIT explicitly prohibits discriminatory measures during the pre-establishment phase of an investment.336 Specifically, the Claimant contends that the Respondent violated its obligations under Articles II(2) and II(3)(b) of the US-Lithuania BIT incorporated through Article 3(2) of the Agreement by \"\u2018screen[ing]\u2019 Mr. Bosca\u2019s attempted acquisition of Alita on the basis of his nationality,\" \"apply[ing] criteria applicable to that acquisition on a less favorable basis than those applied to the Executive Consortium,\" and \"impair[ing] the acquisition of Alita with arbitrary and discriminatory measures.\"337\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 258. Claimant\u2019s Brief, para. 94.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 269.\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that he is not seeking to alter the definition of \"investment\" under the Agreement through the use of the US-Lithuania BIT; rather, he seeks to expand the application of its substantive protections under the present Agreement\u2019s MFN clause, relying on the decisions in *Pope and Talbot v. Canada* and *MTD v. Chile* which concluded that the relevant MFN clauses supported expanded protection for the investors.338 The Claimant argues that the MFN clause extends the scope of a right already conferred by the Agreement by pointing to the treatment of the \"investor\" rather than an \"investment.\"339 Accordingly, the Claimant maintains that the definition of \"investor\" is not predicated on the meaning of \"investment.\" For example, Article 2(1) of the Agreement requires that both Contracting Parties \"encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to invest in their territory.\" This provision confirms, the Claimant contends, that the definition of the term \"investor\" was not intended to entail the characteristic of having an \"investment.\"340\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 262-263, citing *Pope and Talbot v. Canada*, Award, para. 117; *MTD v. Chile*, Decision on Annulment (21 March 2007), para. 18.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 253.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 81. The Claimant notes, in an aside, that all three languages of the original Agreement are authentic, though the English text governs where there is any dispute. On this basis, the Claimant finds it unnecessary to discuss the meaning of the relevant provisions in those other languages; nevertheless, the Claimant maintains that its position is supported by all three languages of the Agreement and elaborates briefly upon their respective significances. Claimant\u2019s Brief, paras. 86-88.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the dispute settlement provision of the Agreement is \"incompatible\" with the operation of the MFN clause rests on a false premise that disputes \"on investments\" and those \"arising out of or relating to\" investments are not equivalent.341 According to the Claimant, a dispute \"on investments\" can exist regardless of whether the investment has been fully acquired by a claimant.342 Likewise, the Claimant submits that the definition of \"investor\" under Article 1(2) of the Agreement includes \"any legal or natural persons that are engaged in contributing something of value to the host State in the expectation of future profit or gain\" and does not require that the investor's investment be fully formed or acquired.343\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 253.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 103.\n\nClaimant's Brief, para. 89.\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant's assertion that the Respondent violated the MFN obligation under Article 3(2) of the Agreement, arguing that MFN treatment under the Agreement does not extend to the pre-establishment phase of investment because the Agreement does not recognize protection for pre-establishment investments.344 In the absence of an investment, the MFN clause does not enable the Claimant to seek a remedy at all.345 Rather, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant is seeking to subvert the limits of protection in the Agreement and extend the jurisdiction of the Tribunal beyond the scope of the Agreement to the Claimant's pre-contractual conduct.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 217.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 218.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent argues, first, that the MFN clause in Article 3(2) cannot create a \"distinct and novel right\" unrelated to the Agreement346 nor extend protection under another treaty to beneficiaries not otherwise entitled to protection under the governing treaty.347 The Respondent elaborates on the implications of Article 3(2)'s reference to \"investors\" rather than \"investments\" by pointing to the definition of \"investor\" in the Agreement as an individual who is \"investing\" - meaning, according to the Respondent, already investing and continuing to invest, *i.e.*, with an investment.348 According to the Respondent, the deliberate phrasing of Article 3 implies the Contracting Parties' intention to exclude the pre-establishment stage of investment from the ambit of protection of the MFN unlike in the US-Lithuania BIT.349\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 220-222.

Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 307.\n\n263.\n\nThe Respondent argues that in any event it did not violate the MFN clause because it did not fail to accord the Claimant national treatment vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimant's activities in Lithuania.353\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 238.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal has already ruled that the Service Agreement constituted an investment of the Claimant under the Agreement and that his accepted bid for Alita was an associated activity under the Protocol to the Agreement which should be considered part of his investment. Therefore, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to carry out an analysis concerning the added value of the Agreement\u2019s MFN clause in this respect, all the more since any conclusion in that regard would not lead to awarding additional damages.\n\n**G. EXPROPRIATION**\n--------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"expropriation\" includes not only a measure that deprives an investor of the value of his investment but also a measure that deprives the investor of a discrete right having economic value - a right that is associated with, but separable from, the investor\u2019s overall investment, such as the Claimant\u2019s right to conclude a contract.354 In the Claimant\u2019s view, his case presents a \"classic case of direct expropriation\" in violation of Article 5 of the Agreement because the SPF deprived him of his right to conclude a contract for the purchase of Alita and negatively affected the value of his investment in Lithuania.355\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 281-286, citing *Waste Management, Inc. v.

Claimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 267.\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimant observes that Article 5 of the Agreement requires the Respondent not to take any measures that would deprive the Claimant of the value of his investment \"unless such measures were: (1) undertaken in the public interest; (2) accompanied by payment of full and effective compensation; (3) non-discriminatory; and (4) in accordance with law.\"356 The Claimant submits that none of the cumulative requirements under Article 5(1) were met here.357 First, the Claimant points to the fact that the Alita Commission determined that the Respondent\u2019s conduct during the tender harmed the public interest of Lithuania.358 Second, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s expropriatory measures in the context of the tender were undertaken in violation of its own domestic laws, as confirmed by Lithuania\u2019s highest national courts.359 Third, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was \"blatantly discriminatory.\"360 Fourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent did not provide him with \"immediate, full and effective\" compensation.361\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 271.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 293.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 294-298.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 299-302.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 303.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 304.\n\n267.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant submits that the Respondent violated Article 5 by appropriating his right to conclude the SPA for the purchase of Alita, an economic right accruing by law.362 He analogizes to the circumstances in the case of *Eureko v. Poland* in which the tribunal concluded that the respondent State had violated the expropriation clause of the Dutch-Polish bilateral investment treaty by \"refusing to conduct an IPO after it had committed to the claimant that it would do so.\"363 The Claimant contends that the economic right he had acquired under Lithuanian law for compensation was \"akin to concessions, permits and licenses.\"364\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 274.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 279, quoting *Eureko v. Poland*, Partial Award, para. 240.\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 256-260.\n\n268.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, this case can be distinguished from *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* on which the Respondent relies. In its award, the tribunal found no expropriation despite the existence of several contracts. Here, the Claimant contends, he has shown \"what his investment was, what his rights were under Lithuanian law, as well as the way in which the [Respondent] interfered with those rights,\" whereas Generation Ukraine was unable to substantiate these critical features in the presentation of its case.365\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 261-263, citing *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, Award, paras. 18.1-18.4, 20.26-20.27, 20.31-20.32.\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's contention that the SPF's decision to annul the Alita tender results and to conclude the SPA with the Executive Consortium constitutes expropriation.366 The Respondent submits that Article 5 of the Agreement has no application here.367 Rather, the Respondent claims that \"expropriation\" as intended under Article 5 requires \"a strong interference with clearly defined contract rights\"368 whereas the Respondent argues that the Claimant has acquired no \"economic right\" under the Agreement.369 The Claimant's alleged right to conclude the contract, if any, does not constitute an object of expropriation according to the Respondent because it cannot be an object of a commercial transaction, has no monetary value, and lacks \"clarity and explicitness of the parties' mutual obligations.\"370\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 240.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 241.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 314-316, quoting *PSEG v. Turkey*, Award, para. 279.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 243-244.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 245-252, quoting *PSEG v. Turkey*, Award, para. 279; *PSEG v. Turkey*, Decision on Jurisdiction (4 June 2004), para. 103.\n\n270.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's expectations, if any, that the SPA would be concluded cannot constitute an object of expropriation until such expectations are transformed into legally binding contractual rights.371 In the Respondent's view, parties negotiating a contract have only \"rights of procedural nature arising out of general statutory duties of good faith\" which cannot be equated with \"rights arising out of governmental agreements or administrative decisions granting valid, explicit proprietary rights.\"372\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 257-261. Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 332.\n\nRespondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 309-313.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent cites the award in *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* to support its assertion that the denial of rights arising out of contractual relations may not amount to expropriation of future commercial return.373 The Respondent maintains that it is even more speculative to claim that the denial of pre-contractual rights amounts to expropriation.374\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 253, quoting *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, Award, para. 20.27. Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 319-323.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 254-256.\n\n272.\n\nWith respect to the termination of negotiations, the Respondent submits that \"neither tangible nor intangible property was transferred to the State or to the other parties.\"375 In this regard, the Respondent comments that the SPF\u2019s decision to negotiate with the Executive Consortium was \"a separate decision and a separate procedure\" from its decision to withdraw from the negotiations with the Claimant and cannot constitute an expropriation.376 Moreover, the Respondent argues that the termination of the negotiations did not affect the overall economic value of the Claimant\u2019s alleged activities in Lithuania.377\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 265.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 328.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 268-275. Respondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 330.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------\n\n273.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal finds no reason to scrutinize whether the factual record supports a finding of liability under other provisions of the Agreement including Article 5 as alleged by Claimant and contested by the Respondent in light of the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Respondent breached the Agreement\u2019s just and fair treatment clause. Any additional breach is not relevant unless it leads to additional damages, which it would not do here.\n\n**H. DAMAGES AND QUANTUM**\n--------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal will take up the Parties\u2019 arguments on damages and on quantum together, after their presentation below.\n\n**1. Entitlement to damages**\n-----------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimant claims that he is entitled to damages of EUR 207,971,000 including interest, as of 7 September 2012.378\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, paras. 1, 165. In the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, the Claimant submitted that he was entitled to damages of EUR 229,836,000. Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 335. The Claimant later lowered this total in response to the Respondent\u2019s criticism that the Claimant\u2019s original calculation did not take into account that \"the sales and distribution costs should be considered to be a function of sales.\" Claimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 323, 332-333.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the issue of damages in this case is governed by the Agreement and by principles of customary international law.379 The Claimant argues that, through the Agreement\u2019s MFN clause, he is entitled to the most favorable damages permitted under international law principles applicable to Lithuania.380 Relying on the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, the Claimant submits that he is entitled to monetary damages equivalent to the benefit of the bargain he would have had received if the Respondent had not wrongfully expropriated his investment.381 According to the Claimant, but for the unlawful actions of the Respondent, the SPA would have been concluded and the Claimant would have acquired at least 83.77 percent of the Alita shares by early 2004.382\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 306-307.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 310.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 311-312, quoting *The Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

Claimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 284.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 287, 290.\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimant objects to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that he is not entitled to damages in connection with the \"un-concluded contract,\"383 arguing that he seeks a remedy not for a breach of a contract but for the deprivation of his investment.384 The Claimant further submits that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility require that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"385 Thus, the Claimant argues that the Respondent must compensate him for all damages he suffered as a result of the Respondent's illegal conduct.386\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 293, quoting Respondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 284-298.\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 295-296.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 315.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 317.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the Respondent's argument that the Claimant's damages have \"no causal link with the alleged breaches\" of the Agreement because the SPA \"would not have been concluded anyway.\"387 The Claimant maintains that the SPA would have been concluded but for the Respondent's arbitrary and discriminatory conduct.388 There were no intervening causes or factors precipitating the termination of negotiations, nor did the Claimant have any intention to break off negotiations; further, the financing of the purchase price had been secured.389 The Claimant maintains that there is no basis to support the Respondent's position that the competition authorities would have rejected the acquisition of Alita by the Claimant or his proposed subsequent acquisition of Boslita.390 Even if the Tribunal were to determine that it lacks conclusive evidence to find that the Claimant would have acquired Alita and managed it profitably in the absence of the SPF's wrongful conduct, according to the Claimant the \"loss of a specific and substantial chance\" to do so is compensable under international law.391\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 294, quoting Respondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 303-332.\n\nClaimant's Brief, paras. 51-56.\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 302-306.\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 311-313.\n\nClaimant's Brief, paras. 57, 60.\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, even assuming *arguendo* that the Respondent breached its international obligations, the Claimant cannot claim damages.392 Were the Tribunal to conclude that damages were warranted, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has received adequate remedy through Lithuanian national courts,393 that is, reimbursement for the direct damages associated with the terminated negotiations in the amount of LTL 1,733,584.99 (or EUR 502,081).394\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 279.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 194. Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 273-276.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 280.\n\n280.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimant's claim for damages is \"disproportional\" to the value of his alleged investment and constitutes a \"manifest abuse\" of the Agreement.395 The Respondent suggests that the claimed damages, if granted, would have an \"obvious and strong negative impact\" on the Respondent's economy that should be taken into consideration in the assessment of the damages.396\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 280-283, citing *Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara (PLN)*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (4 May 1999); *Tecmed v. Mexico*, Award, para. 186. Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder, paras. 340-342.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 339-341.\n\n281.\n\nThe Respondent argues that awarding compensation to the Claimant for lost profits would be \"overly speculative and uncertain\" since no contract was concluded between the Claimant and the SPF.397 The *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle relied upon by the Claimant applies to breaches involving \"income-producing asset[s],\" unlike here.398 The Respondent contends that the Claimant could at best seek recovery of direct damages, which have already been awarded by Lithuanian courts.399 Moreover, the Respondent suggests that the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts provide for recovery of direct expenses and the lost opportunity to conclude another contract but not lost profit.400 According to the Respondent, under Lithuanian law, the Claimant would not have been indemnified for lost profit.401\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 285-288.

Quantum**\n--------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n284.\n\nTurning more specifically to the calculation of damages, the Claimant argues that the date of the unlawful act and the date of the forthcoming award should be used to carry out the necessary calculations of the damages owing to him.409 The Claimant names 14 October 2003, the date on which he was removed from the Alita tender negotiations, as the date of the unlawful act.410\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 318-319.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 319.\n\n285.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the commonly used discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method is the most appropriate method to determine the fair market value of the Claimant's investment.411 In applying the DCF method, the Claimant argues that \"post-act events\" may be taken into consideration in the case of unlawful expropriation or other breaches of the Agreement, and that, even if an \"*ex ante* projection\" based on the data prior to 2003 were used, the amount of the Claimant's damages would in fact be greater than the amount calculated in consideration of \"post-act events.\"412\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 322-323, citing, *inter alia*, *Lemire v. Ukraine*, Award, paras. 219, 227; *Tecmed v. Mexico*, Award, paras. 185-186.\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, paras. 325-326.\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimant submits that his damages include the value of Alita and the proceeds of the Alita business he would have received.413 Based on his expert report, the Claimant submits that the present value of Alita is LTL 400,339,000.414 According to the Claimant, his damages also include, but are not limited to: (1) \"the lost synergies that would have resulted from combining the Boslita and Alita businesses, such as increased buying power, reduction in overheads, costs of raw materials and other inputs, increased distribution capacity, increased export capacity, increased goodwill in the former USSR countries and increased margins;\" (2) the lost opportunity to expand existing operations; and (3) loss of the subsequent increase in market value of the company, lost profits, and loss of market share.415\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 321.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 327.

Claimant's Memorial, para. 325.\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, in addition, he is entitled to compound interest of 2.8 percent on the amount of the damages calculated above beginning on the date of the Respondent's wrongful act, *i.e*., 14 October 2003.416\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 332-333. Claimant's Counter-memorial/Reply, para. 332.\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant's use of the DCF method to calculate his alleged damages, arguing that the DCF method is used to estimate future free cash flows of \"income-earning assets\" and is not appropriate to calculate the value of a \"free-standing right to conclude a contract.\"417\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, para. 345.\n\n289.\n\nEven if the DCF method is employed, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant's expert incorrectly relies on the financial performance of Alita after the privatization in his calculation.418 As a primary matter, the Claimant's expert wrongly calculates the value of Alita rather than that of Alita's shares.419 Other calculation choices made by the expert contribute to an overstatement of the Claimant's alleged damages. For example, the Respondent disputes the value of the alleged \"synergies\" resulting from the proposed merger of Boslita and Alita, arguing that the Claimant's business plans are \"highly speculative,\" and that numerous legal obstacles would have prevented the Claimant from executing the merger.420 The Respondent argues that the Claimant's assertion that he would have exported his products to Russia is based on \"uncertain and speculative\" assumptions.421 Further, in the Respondent's view, the Claimant incorrectly adds back corporate income taxes deducted in assessing his suffered damages to his valuation.422\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 347-351.\n\nRespondent's Brief, paras. 144-146.\n\nRespondent's Counter-memorial, paras. 353-359.

Respondent's Reply/Rejoinder, para. 506.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s calculation of interest for three reasons. First, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot calculate interest on lost profits as of the day of the alleged breach because such an approach would lead the Claimant to unjust enrichment by allowing him to earn interest on profits yet to be received if the Claimant had acquired Alita.423 Second, the Claimant cannot calculate interest on both the lost profits and the income-earning capital; this calculation contravenes Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and would provide the Claimant with double recovery.424 Third, the Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot seek recovery of interest on the loss of profit in connection with what he has never invested because this recovery too would provide the Claimant with double recovery: having saved the money he would have paid to acquire Alita, the Claimant cannot be put in a more favorable position than the one he would have been in had he in fact acquired Alita.425\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 364.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 365-366.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, para. 367. Respondent\u2019s Reply/Rejoinder, para. 530.\n\n*The Tribunal's Decision on Damages and Quantum*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nBased on the comparatively very large price offered by the Claimant, he had legitimate expectations that the Respondent would approve the SPA with the conditions contained in his bid. But the Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant\u2019s statement that \"Mr. Bosca\u2019s acquisition of Alita was a certainty.\"426\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 151.\n\n292.\n\nFirst of all, there is no certainty that the Claimant would have accepted the condition on fines set by the SPF in the draft SPA. The Claimant, even at the time of his testimony at the hearing, never confirmed that he would have been ready to accept anything significantly different from the condition he had set or that he would have been willing to compromise on the basis of the very minor adjustments subsequently granted to the Consortium.427 It is worth noting that in the Lithuanian proceedings the Claimant initiated before the Vilnius District Court on 17 November 2003, the Claimant stated that, although he was committed to reaching a reasonable agreement, the conditions set out in his bid \"formed an integral part of the Tender Bid that [the] State Property had accepted, therefore, they could not have been altered without Luigiterzo Bosca\u2019s approval.\"428 Further, he noted that he \"adhered to the position that penalty amounts set forth in his Tender Bid and his proposals regarding draft Contract attached thereto should be reflected in the final draft Contract.\"429\n\nHearing Transcript 383: 17-21 (Mr. Bosca\u2019s testimony: \"I wanted to negotiate something about the amount of the fine, or a cap on the fine, or something which could make me a little more confident. This was the main reason, and they kept saying no, no, no.\").\n\nClaimant\u2019s Claim Application with Vilnius District Court, Exh. R-91, pp. 3, 7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Claim Application with Vilnius District Court, Exh. R-91, pp. 3, 7.\n\n293.\n\nIt is not out of possibility, bearing the very strong reservations of the Claimant concerning the issue of fines, that he might, in the end, have decided to walk away from the deal, even at the cost of losing the payments he had already made.\n\n294.\n\nAs far as the Respondent is concerned, it could well have held to its guns (as it did), notwithstanding the great financial superiority of the Claimant\u2019s bid. The PTC or the Government might have considered that, in light of the refusal of the Claimant to accept the provision on fines, he could not be trusted to abide by the conditions set out in the SPA and the Lithuanian laws and regulations and that it would be preferable to call for a new tender. This is an option that the SPF\u2019s advisor, Suprema, considered before finally opting to try to negotiate with the fourth place bidder (who had suddenly become the second place bidder). It is not inconceivable either that, for whatever reason, (even after having received the Consortium\u2019s bid), the Government might by then have changed its mind and decided to cancel the privatization of Alita, reimburse the bidder and keep it as a State-owned company, at least for a certain period, before putting it again on the market.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken notice of the unchallenged testimony of the former Chairman of the Competition Council, Prof. Rimantas Stanikunas, to the effect that the Council would have approved the Claimant\u2019s purchase of Alita, especially taking into account the fact that, with the entry of Lithuania into the European Union, Alita\u2019s geographic market had expanded and encompassed the whole EU. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Council would not have imposed some restrictions on the transaction once it would have been made aware of the Service Agreement between the Claimant and Boslita, the Option Agreement between the Claimant and Mrs. Skorupskien\u00e8 on thirty percent (30%) of the shares of Boslita and the Claimant\u2019s plan for combining the activities of Boslita and Alita in 2004. It remains an open question whether the Claimant would have proceeded with the purchase of Alita if such restrictions had been imposed, since they would most likely have had an impact on the expected rate of return of the Claimant\u2019s investment.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s view is that the outcome of the process was by no means certain and the Parties themselves have recognized that, even after the declaration that the Claimant was the winning bidder, they were still in pre-contractual negotiations.430\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 41. Respondent\u2019s Brief, para. 40.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is that the Claimant is entitled to compensation for lost opportunity resulting from the failure of the SPF to respect the legal rules which governed it in the negotiations of the SPA with the winning bidder who had legitimate expectations that the negotiations would be carried out in accordance with law and that the SPA could be successfully concluded.\n\n298.\n\nThe Claimant called upon a valuation expert, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Alberro, to estimate the damages the Claimant suffered. Dr. Alberro estimated damages of EUR 205,996,000 as of 1 May 2012.431 As to the Claimant himself, his claim for pre-tax damages as of 7 September 2012 was set at EUR 207,971,000.432\n\nAlberro Second Expert Report, p. 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Brief, para. 164.\n\n299.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent retained the services of Mr. Brent Kaczmarek who argued that Dr. Alberro\u2019s methodology contained several flaws which rendered his conclusions \"unsound and unreliable.\"433\n\nKaczmarek Expert Report, p. 14.\n\n300.\n\nWithout questioning the quality of the analysis contained in these two reports, it should be noted that Dr. Alberro was instructed to evaluate the damages resulting from the annulment of the Claimant\u2019s successful bid as well as the denial of the Claimant\u2019s right to receive the benefits associated with the ownership of Alita.434 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, these two assumptions are distinguishable. While the first is legitimate in the present case, the Tribunal does not agree that the Annulment Order of the SPF opens the door to a claim for damages (lost profits) that could have been claimed had the SPA been concluded. The only sustainable claim in the present case is one for lost opportunity in a pre-contractual situation.\n\nAlberro First Expert Report, p. 4.\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimant, in pre-contractual negotiations, is only entitled to recover direct damages (monies paid to the Respondent in the privatization process and costs incurred in this case). Lost profits based on the assumption of an agreed SPA are much too remote and speculative. The Respondent has provided sufficient arbitral and doctrinal support for that position.435\n\nAmong others, *PSEG v. Turkey*, Award, paras. 312-313; *Metalclad v. Mexico*, Award, paras. 120-121; Zachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge University Press, 2009), para. 288.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimant has already been reimbursed (albeit belatedly) by the Respondent for the amounts paid to the Respondent on his behalf as well as the direct costs incurred, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Lithuania in 2006. Though the Claimant is not entitled to double recovery, the Lithuanian courts were not called upon to rule on the Respondent\u2019s liability under the Agreement, a matter which is under the responsibility of this Tribunal.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Respondent breached the Agreement and should indemnify the Claimant; however, the Claimant has already been reimbursed for the monies he paid to the Respondent. The only question that remains is the amount of costs incurred by the Claimant in connection with the present proceedings that should be reimbursed by the Respondent.\n\n**VI. THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, under Articles 40(1) and 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate costs, taking into account the circumstances of the case.436 The Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay all fees and costs in light of the Claimant\u2019s success in the Lithuanian courts, his attempt to settle with the Respondent, and what the Claimant has alleged as the Respondent\u2019s bad faith conduct.437\n\nClaimant\u2019s Costs Application, para. 9. Claimant\u2019s Amended Costs Application, para. 7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Costs Application, paras. 1, 18. Claimant\u2019s Amended Costs Application, paras. 1, 13-14.\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimant claims as his costs EUR 4,580,421.21 (USD 5,824,822.17), made up of EUR 3,504,113.78 (USD 4,456,014.43) in attorneys\u2019 fees, EUR 516,608.36 (USD 657,197.62) in expert witness\u2019 fees, EUR 81,396.85 (USD 103,498.24) in other reasonable and necessary fees and costs, and EUR 78,302.22 (USD 99,547.06) in travel and accommodation costs associated with hearing preparation and attendance, as well as EUR 400,000 in case deposits requested by the Tribunal.438\n\nClaimant\u2019s Amended Costs Application, paras. 3, 15-18.\n\n*The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------\n\n306.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, its costs amount to EUR 890,230.27439 consisting of (1) case deposits of EUR 400,000;440 (2) EUR 306,830 in expert fees;441 and (3) EUR 183,400.27 in legal representation fees.442\n\nRespondent\u2019s Amended Statement on Costs, para. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Amended Statement on Costs, para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Amended Statement on Costs, para. 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Amended Statement on Costs, para. 7.\n\n307.\n\nOn 28 November 2012, the Respondent submitted Comments on the Claimant\u2019s Costs Application, which raised five objections to that Application. First, it argued that the Claimant should not be awarded costs incurred prior to 19 March 2010, the date of the initiation of this arbitration, because he failed to negotiate a possible settlement.443 Second, the counsel costs of the two law firms retained by the Claimant do not meet the test of reasonableness and proportionality, taking into account the level of expertise of the Claimant\u2019s counsel.444 Third, the issues raised by the Claimant in his Costs Application concerning the relevance of national court decisions and those relating to counsel for the Respondent cannot support the awarding of costs against the Respondent.445 Fourth, the Claimant is responsible for abuse of process by having submitted at least four documents that he has not shown to be authentic: the Option Agreement,446 the Contract for Buying-Selling Shares,447 the Stock Purchase Agreement of 2 July 2002448 and the Service Agreement.449 Fifth, the Claimant resorted to abuse of process by waiting until his Post-Hearing Brief to submit a clear and explicit statement of his position, thus depriving the Respondent the opportunity for further rebuttal.450\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments, para. 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments, paras. 6, 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments, para. 10.\n\nOption Agreement, Exhs.

The Claimant has raised new claims under the basis of the Agreement and international law, which was his full right, and the Respondent was entitled to defend itself against such claims.\n\n311.\n\nAs to the argument that the Claimant attempted, without success, to settle with the Respondent, the Tribunal has received little, and somewhat contradictory, evidence in that regard. In its view, the Tribunal has not obtained enough evidence to conclude that any Party behaved improperly or negligently in that respect. The steps taken by either side in that regard were too tentative and vague to justify any conclusion as to costs in the present arbitration.\n\n312.\n\nAs to the conduct of the LAWIN law firm and some of its members in this case, the Tribunal has already addressed this issue in its Procedural Order No. 2 and ruled that it \"did not believe that it has the authority to rule on the interpretation to be given to the ethical rules applicable to Lithuanian attorneys under Lithuanian law.\" As to the fact that one of the LAWIN partners, Dr. Smaliukas (whose wife is also a partner and counsel in this case), was produced as a legal expert witness and that one of its senior associates, Mr. Nosevi\u010d, was produced as a fact witness has also been addressed in that Order. The Tribunal ruled that such a procedure was highly unusual and that it would bear these circumstances in mind when addressing the issues raised by the Parties. The evidence provided by these two witnesses has had no noticeable influence on the conclusions reached by the Tribunal, either on law or on facts. As to the case of Mr. Giedrius Stasevi\u010dius, another partner who appeared in this case, the issue raised in his respect had to do with his previous role as counsel to Suprema, a consulting firm which advised the SPF during the Alita tender negotiation process; in the Claimant\u2019s view, Mr. Stasevi\u010dius\u2019 active role in the Hearing underscored his conflicting duties to his client and to the Tribunal. However, as with the other members of the LAWIN law firm mentioned above, this is clearly a matter coming under the Lithuanian professional ethical rules and cannot have a bearing on the issue of costs.\n\n313.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s arguments, the Tribunal answers them as follows.\n\n314.\n\nAs to the first concerning the period during which costs can be eligible for payment, the Tribunal does not see a valid reason to reject any cost incurred by the Claimant prior to the initiation of this arbitration on 19 March 2010 so long as the claimed costs are related to the present arbitration and fully justified. In his Costs Application, the Claimant specifies that he is submitting costs he incurred during the arbitration proceedings. They appear to include only those incurred after the six-month negotiation period ending in August (or early September) 2007, which post-dates most of the local proceedings. The Tribunal has dealt above with the argument based on the alleged settlement negotiations.\n\n315.\n\nSecondly, there is clearly a large differential between the Claimant's and the Respondent's legal costs. The Respondent chose to rely principally on a Lithuanian law firm (EUR 142,866.87) which it retains in other matters and only marginally on the foreign law firm it retained (EUR 40,533.40). Moreover, there is little doubt that the Respondent could rely on the contribution of its officials in various departments to support the work of its external counsel, with no apparent cost attributed to this case. The Claimant was in a very different situation. He selected, as was his right, an international law firm which played a prominent role in this case and was seconded by a Lithuanian law firm.\n\n316.\n\nIt is not the task of the Tribunal to determine the choice of counsel for the Parties; the Tribunal does not see anything inappropriate or abnormal in the strategy chosen in that regard by the Claimant. Furthermore, taking into account the nature of the case and all it involved, the Tribunal does not find the costs claimed to be out of proportion when compared to those claimed in other cases of a similar nature.\n\n317.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal has already addressed the issue of the relevance of the national courts' decisions and the challenges to counsel for the Respondent. The Tribunal does not find the Claimant's arguments in that regard frivolous or inappropriate and they cannot be considered as an abuse of process.\n\n318.\n\nFourthly, the Tribunal does not consider either as an abuse of process the fact that the Claimant could not produce authentic texts of the documents mentioned above. The Tribunal is of the view that the copies produced and the testimonies of the relevant witnesses in that respect allowed the Tribunal to rely on the content of those documents.\n\n319.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal cannot find an abuse of process in the content of the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief. The \"clear and explicit explanation of his position\" which, the Respondent says, came out only in the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief seems to the Tribunal to flow naturally from the written and oral evidence previously submitted by the Parties. The Respondent has provided no evidence to support its contention in that regard. Furthermore, if the Respondent felt that the Claimant had taken a position in his Post-Hearing Brief which was new, it was always open to the Respondent to apply to the Tribunal for an authorization to answer that new position, which the Respondent has not done.\n\n320.\n\nHaving disposed of the arguments raised by each Party in relation to costs, the Tribunal will concentrate on the reasons which guide it in its decision. The authority of the Tribunal in matters of fees and costs is dealt with in Articles 38, 40(1) and 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n321.\n\nArticle 40(1) provides:\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n322.\n\nAs to Article 40(2), it reads:\n\nWith respect to the costs of the legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\nArticle 38 leaves open the meaning of \"assistance\" in the context of \"the costs of legal representation and assistance.\"\n\n323.\n\nThe Claimant has been successful on the issues of admissibility, jurisdiction and liability and on the principle of damages. The Tribunal sees no reason not to follow the general principle enunciated in Article 40(1); the costs of arbitration in this case should be borne by the Respondent as detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal fixes the costs of arbitration as follows, plus interest as determined below:\n\n- As per Article 38(a) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the fees of the Tribunal members amount to EUR 484,26.52, *i.e.*, The Hon. Marc Lalonde's fees total EUR 250,736.92, Mr. Daniel Price's fees total EUR 100,500.00, and Prof. Brigitte Stern's fees total EUR 133,089.60.\n\n- As per Article 38(b)-(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the remaining costs expended from the Parties' case deposit for the Tribunal members' travel and other assistance rendered by the PCA and service-providers in the course of these proceedings total EUR 199,245.27.\n\nThe Tribunal will treat the Parties' expert witness costs, as well as the travel and accommodation costs of each Party, as part of the costs of legal representation and assistance under Article 38(e) per the discussion below; thus, the Tribunal need not approve any additional witness-related costs, nor have the Parties enumerated any, pursuant to Article 38(d). Finally, in reference to Article 38(f), the Tribunal notes that no costs were incurred by any appointing authority in this matter nor by the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n325.\n\nTogether, the costs of arbitration referenced above as falling within Article 38(a-c) of the UNCITRAL Rules amount to EUR 683,571.79 plus interest as determined below, and shall be borne by the Respondent in full, in accordance with Article 40(1). Thus, the Respondent shall pay the Claimant half this amount (or EUR 341,785.90) and the PCA shall reimburse the Parties in equal parts the amount that remains in the case deposit (EUR 116,428.21, or EUR 58,214.10 to each Party).\n\n326.\n\nAs to the costs of legal representation and assistance under Article 38(e) and Article 40(2), although the Tribunal has ruled that the Claimant's damages be very substantially reduced from his claim for EUR 207,971,000, the Claimant is the successful Party in light of the breach committed by the Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant may generally recover the costs of his legal representation from the Respondent.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful, however, that not all the Claimant's expert reports were relevant or useful to the Tribunal's analysis. For instance, the expert report authored by Dr. Ariel Cohen submitted by the Claimant did not make any meaningful contribution to the Tribunal's analysis. In addition, while prevailing on the principle of damages, the Claimant has failed to obtain anything approaching his claim in that respect. Thus, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent, in addition to supporting its own costs, should bear most of the Claimant's costs, excepting twenty percent (20%). The Respondent should bear eighty percent (80%) of the legal representation and assistance costs incurred by the Claimant which totalled EUR 4,180,421.21 (thus, 80% of Claimant's total legal fees amounts to EUR 3,344,336.97) plus interest as determined below.\n\n328.\n\nInterest on the amount awarded to the Claimant shall run from the date of this Award and be set at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) three-month rate in effect on the date of this Award, plus two percent (2%) compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award.\n\n(The rest of this page is left intentionally blank.)\n\n**VII. DISPOSITIF**\n-------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore unanimously decides and awards as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimant\u2019s claim is admissible and the objections raised by the Respondent in that respect are dismissed.\n\n(b) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n(c) The Respondent has breached its obligation to grant just and fair treatment to the Claimant, under the first sentence of Article 2(2) of the Agreement.\n\n(d) In light of its decision concerning just and fair treatment and of the fact that any further breach would not, in this case, lead to additional damages, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to rule on the other alleged breaches of the Agreement raised by the Claimant.\n\n(e) The Claimant is only entitled to recover direct damages (monies paid to the Respondent in the privatization process of Alita and costs incurred in this case).\n\n(f) The Claimant has already been reimbursed by the Respondent for the amounts paid to it on behalf of the Claimant in the privatization process of Alita.\n\n(g) The Respondent shall bear the costs of arbitration in this case expended from the case deposit in the amount of EUR 683,571.79 plus interest as determined below.\n\n(h) The Respondent shall pay to the Claimant eighty percent (80%) of the costs of legal representation and assistance incurred by him which totalled EUR 4,180,421.21 (80% of which amounts to EUR 3,344,336.97) plus interest as determined below.\n\n(i) Interest on the amount awarded to the Claimant shall run from the date of this Award and be set at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) three-month rate in effect on the date of this Award, plus two percent (2%) compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award."}]}
