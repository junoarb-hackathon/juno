Procedure**\n----------------\n\n[1].\n\nOn November 2, 1994, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) received from Tradex Hellas S.A. (Tradex), a company incorporated in Greece, a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Albania (Albania). The Request asserted a claim for compensation for an alleged expropriation in Albania. Details of the Request and the Claim are described in a later section of this decision.\n\n[2].\n\nIn the absence of agreement upon the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment more than 60 days after the registration of the Request, Tradex Hellas chose the formula provided for in Art. 37 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention, i.e. a tribunal consisting of three arbitrators, one appointed by Tradex, one appointed by the Republic of Albania and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties. By letter dated 06 June 1995, Tradex appointed as arbitrator in this case Mr. Fred F. Fielding, a US national. Mr. Fielding subsequently accepted his appointment.\n\n[3].\n\nThough ICSID in various ways communicated the Request for Arbitration and subsequent correspondence to Albania, no appointment of a second arbitrator was received from Albania, and no agreement was reached between the Parties with respect to the appointment of the third arbitrator. As Art. 38 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 4 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide that, if the tribunal has not been constituted within 90 days after the notice of registration of the Arbitration Request, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council shall, at the request of either party and after consulting both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator(s) not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to be President of the tribunal, Tradex requested ICSID to appoint the other two arbitrators.\n\n[4].\n\nIn December 1995, after notifying the Parties, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appointed Prof. Andrea Giardina, an Italian citizen, as the second arbitrator, and Prof. Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, a German citizen, as the third arbitrator and President of the tribunal. Both accepted the appointment.\n\n[5].\n\nBy a decision of 26 December 1995, the Council of Ministers of Albania accepted the appointments of Prof. Giardina and Prof. Bockstiegel as arbitrators and charged the Ministry of Agriculture and Food with representing the Republic of Albania in the proceedings.\n\n[6].\n\nThe Tribunal scheduled a first session with the Parties for February 27, 1996, in Washington. After consultation with the Parties and with their agreement, the session in Washington was cancelled and instead the first session of the Tribunal with the Parties was scheduled to take place in Frankfurt (Germany) on April 10, 1996.\n\n[7].\n\nAt that session, in addition to other procedural details discussed and agreed, it was agreed that subsequent meetings of the Tribunal with the Parties would take place in London. Also at the session, counsel for Albania confirmed that Albania would shortly be sending to the Centre written objections to jurisdiction in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41 (1). Counsel for Albania gave a summary presentation of the grounds on which such objections would be based. Counsel for Tradex responded. Thereafter the proceedings on the merits were suspended in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41 (3). Dates for written submissions by the Parties were agreed upon and it was also provisionally agreed that an oral hearing on jurisdiction would take place in London on September 10, 1996.\n\n[8].\n\nAfter the session in Frankfurt, written submissions by Albania were received dated 15 April 1996, 10 June 1996, and 09 August 1996, and written submissions by Tradex were received dated 31 May 1996 and 30 July 1996. Starting with Albania's submission dated 10 June 1996, Prof. James Crawford acted as additional counsel for Albania.\n\n[9].\n\nAt the hearing in London on September 10, 1996, after an introduction by the President of the Tribunal regarding procedural matters, both Parties made presentations regarding jurisdiction, responded to the other Party's presentation in several rounds and answered questions by members of the Tribunal regarding certain factual or legal aspects related to jurisdiction. Also during the Hearing, Tradex asked whether Albania, in view of its objections to ICSID jurisdiction, was ready to accept this case under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as provided for in the Albanian Investment Protection Law of 1992. Counsel for Albania responded that they were not authorized to express any commitment of Albania regarding UNCITRAL arbitration.\n\n[10].\n\nBy a letter dated 25 September 1996 addressed to Albania represented by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Counsel for Tradex asked for a binding answer by Albania regarding acceptance of UNCITRAL arbitration in this controversy and added that, if no answer was received within 30 days, he would interpret this to the effect that Albania \"has not preferred the arbitration of UNCITRAL\".\n\n[11].\n\nBy a letter dated 8 November 1996 to ICSID, Counsel for Tradex confirmed that no answer had been received from Albania.\n\n[12].\n\nOn 5 December 1996 ICSID provided the Tribunal with a copy it had received of a letter dated 2 December 1996 from Counsel for Albania to Counsel for Tradex containing the following wording:\n\n\"I am instructed by the Minister to respond to your letter of 25 September 1996.\n\nAs indicated during the hearing held in London on 10 September 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Albania considers that the dispute settlement rules applicable to the facts raised in Tradex's Request for ICSID arbitration, if any, are those set forth in Law No. 7594 of 4 August 1992.\n\nArticle 15 of the 1992 Law is therefore applicable. It provides for UNCITRAL arbitration and sets forth certain conditions and exclusions for such arbitration to be effective. Whether those conditions or exclusions have been satisfied or are applicable in respect of the matter brought by Tradex to ICSID raises questions of fact and law which would need to be considered further by the Ministry of Agriculture and eventually by any arbitral Tribunal that might be constituted pursuant to the 1992 Law. In the first place it will be a matter for Tradex whether to decide to make an application for arbitration under UNCITRAL rules in reliance on the 1992 Law.\"\n\n**B. Facts and Contentions**\n----------------------------\n\n[13].\n\nHereafter, the Tribunal will give a short summary of the facts and contentions in this case insofar as it is considered appropriate in the context of this decision only dealing with jurisdiction. Regarding further details, reference is made to the various written briefs and documents submitted by the Parties as well as to the oral presentations by the Parties and the documents submitted with these oral presentations.\n\n[14].\n\nTradex entered into negotiations in 1991 with Albania in order to undertake an engineering, industrial, and agricultural investment in Albania. Negotiations were completed and Albania appointed a state owned company, \"T.B. Torovitsa\", to enter into a joint venture with Tradex for realizing the investment on the basis of a proportional participation of 67 to 33. The land would be contributed by T.B. Torovitsa to the joint venture.\n\n[15].\n\nOn January 10, 1992, Tradex and T.B. Torovitsa signed an agreement (\"the Agreement\") which established a joint venture between them. T.B. Torovitsa was the owner of 1170 ha farm land in T.B. Torovitsa, Lezha, Albania, and the object of the joint venture was the commercial and agricultural use of this land connected with \"the development of the agricultural engineering, the cultivation of agricultural plants/ crops, fruits and vegetables in the fields, development of stock raising / animal products, and the necessary activities pertaining to the processing of milk, meat, and any activities relative to the land and to products yielded by it for the domestic market or exportation\" (Art. 2 of the Agreement). The investment was planned for a duration of 10 years, renewable by either Party for another period of 10 years.\n\n[16].\n\nOn January 21, 1992, the Agreement was approved by an act of the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Economic Affairs called Authorization No. 26. The registrations of the joint venture with competent courts and administrative authorities were completed by March 7 1992.\n\n[17].\n\nUpon the authorization and the completion of formalities concerning the establishment of the joint venture, Tradex commenced the investment according to schedules contained in the Agreement in order to use the farm during the first crop raising period in spring and summer 1992. The investment included various payments totalling US $ 786,343 T.B. Toro-vitsa contributed further payments and the capital thus established was used to finance the cattle production, the field cultivation, the payment of 700 personnel. A feasibility study for a fodder plant and the plan for a frozen vegetables factory were approved by the European Union and financing of Ecu 4,800,000 was secured partially by Tradex and partially by the European Union and several banks.\n\n[18].\n\nTradex claims that the following measures made the development of the joint venture impossible and left the participation and investment in the joint venture valueless so that these acts must be considered as acts of expropriation:\n\na) On August 22, 1992, a most significant part of the farm was formally expropriated and transferred to villages by Albania, namely ha 140 amounting to 15% of the total farm and its most fertile area.\n\nb) Crop production, cattle, and seed supplies were stolen by the villagers at an almost steady rate of 15% between March and October 1992 and work of the management of the joint venture was often impossible because of threats and acts of violence.\n\nc) Beginning December 1992, the entrance of Tradex's personnel to the farm was completely impossible because of the seizure and occupation of the farm by villagers.\n\nd) By letters in late 1992 and early 1993, Tradex requested in vain the intervention by Albania as a last effort to save the investment, but Tradex was obliged to hand over the 140 ha mentioned together with cultivations, cattle, and supplies.\n\n[19].\n\nUnder the circumstances, Tradex and T.B. Torovitsa found it necessary to dissolve the joint venture; the dissolution was agreed on April 21, 1993 \"as of 30.4.1993\". The Minutes of the Liquidators Meeting on March 2, 1994, resolved \"that the liquidation was completed on 16.12.1993\".\n\n[20].\n\nTradex evaluates the market value of its investment according to recognized valuation methods and experience to US $ 2.2 Mill., less the value of the machinery and equipment returned to Tradex as their share of the liquidation proceeds of US $ 176,093. Thus, it estimates the net market value of its loss at US $ 2,023,907 while it estimates its \"real damages\" to be much higher.\n\n[21].\n\nOn that basis, Tradex in this arbitration requests that Albania be obliged and condemned to pay:\n\na) The market value of Tradex's expropriated investment amounting to US $ 2,023,907;\n\nb) interest on that amount mentioned at current banking interest rates, from December 1, 1992, until payment, and\n\nc) fees and legal expenses of Tradex, to be calculated later.\n\n[22].\n\nAlbania considers Tradex's claim as unjustified. But Albania has not responded to the merits of Tradex's claim, as Albania objected to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and, therefore, the procedure on the merits was suspended and the present procedure only deals with jurisdiction in this case. Albania claims that it has not, under Art. 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention and Albanian Law No. 7764 of November 2, 1993 (the \"1993 Law\"), expressed its consent to the matter raised by Tradex in its Request to be subject to ICSID jurisdiction, and that accordingly the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction. In support of this submission, Albania invokes the five arguments which can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2013 The facts presented by Tradex make it obvious that this is a \"dispute\" between Tradex and T.B. Torovitsa and not between Tradex and Albania;\n\n\u2013 The 1993 Law does not apply retroactively and is therefore not applicable to this \"dispute\";\n\n\u2013 Even if the 1993 Law does apply retroactively, Tradex was not a \"foreign investor\" within the meaning of the 1993 Law when the law came into force and cannot therefore rely on its provisions;\n\n\u2013 Even if there is a \"dispute\" between Tradex and Albania and the 1993 Law is applicable, the \"dispute\" does not relate to an \"expropriation\" within the meaning of the 1993 Law; and\n\n\u2013 Tradex made no good faith effort to resolve the \"dispute\" amicably before resorting to arbitration, as required by the 1993 Law and general principles of international law.\n\n[23].\n\nFor the purposes of this jurisdictional phase of the procedure, Albania relies only upon the factual and evidentiary material provided by Tradex as, in Albania's view, these support Albania's arguments on jurisdiction. But Albania reserves the right to challenge the presentations by Tradex and to introduce additional factual and evidentiary material as necessary at a subsequent stage in these proceedings. Albania also expressly confirms its commitment to the full protection of foreign investment in Albania, to the ICSID system, and to its international legal obligations.\n\n[24].\n\nRegarding the factual background, Albania points out the following additional aspects: Under Albanian law, T.B. Torovitsa is a separate legal entity will full capacity to sue and be sued. The capital provided by Tradex comprised machinery, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation investments while the capital provided by T.B. Torovitsa comprised buildings, machinery, life stock, and finished products as well as other assets. None of the joint venture's capital comprised land. The 1992 Agreement noted that T.B. Toro-vitsa was the owner of 1170 ha of land, that the area of land would not change \"during the term of the agreement\", and that the joint venture \"shall respect the supplementary needs which will be created for the land\" (Art. 15). In particular, Albania refers to Art. 16 of the Agreement which provides that disputes between the Parties shall be resolved by arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce and that Swiss law shall be applicable. Furthermore Albania points out that the authorization for the joint venture dated January 21, 1992 expressly provided that the joint venture should conform with Albanian legislation concerning land.\n\n[25].\n\nAs far as the liquidation of the joint venture is concerned, Albania indicates that the Dissolution Agreement dated April 21, 1993, led to the dissolution completed on December 16, 1993 according to the liquidators' report. At the state of liquidation, the liquidators' report valued the joint venture's net worth at lac 6,175,599.05 to be distributed in the proportions 67 % to Tradex and 33 % to T.B. Torovitsa in accordance with Art. 5 of the 1992 Agreement. The liquidators' report proposed that Tradex receive a total of lac 20,842,420 comprising lac 8,804,675 in fixed assets and lac 12,037,745 to be paid by T.B. Torovitsa in installments on the basis of the progress in the liquidation and not later than December 31, 1994. A final partners' meeting was held on March 2, 1994 which resolved to approve the balance sheets drawn up by the liquidators and approved the distribution of the net worth of the joint venture in accordance with the liquidators' report. Tradex did not reserve its rights against T.B. Toro-vitsa or Albania at that final meeting.\n\n[26].\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with further contentions by both Parties later in this decision in the context of its reasons insofar as it considers such contention relevant.\n\n**C. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n[27].\n\nThe Tribunal will now briefly review the major aspects of the legal framework which are relevant to this decision on jurisdiction.\n\n[28].\n\nFirst, reference must be made to the ICSID Convention which Albania ratified on October 15, 1991 and which entered into force for Albania on November 14, 1991. In this context, however, it should be pointed out that neither of the Parties alleges a specific consent to ICSID arbitration in a contract between Tradex and Albania. According to Tradex, Albania consented to ICSID arbitration both in Albania's law No. 7764 of November 2, 1993 (the \"1993 Law\") and in the bilateral investment treaty between Greece and Albania of August 1, 1991. On the other hand, Albania claims that no consent to ICSID arbitration was affected in these two instruments for the present case.\n\n[29].\n\nStarting in 1990, Albania has enacted several laws relevant for foreign investments:\n\n[30].\n\nAlbanian Law No. 7406 of July 31, 1990, on the protection of foreign investments provided in particular that foreign investments in Albania would not be subject to expropriation and any other similar measures, except for specific cases made for public purposes, and always against the payment of \"damages\".\n\n[31].\n\nThis law was replaced by Albanian Law No. 7512 of August 10, 1991, which provided in particular that foreign investments would not be subject to expropriation or similar measures with exception of particular cases and at any rate against payment of full \"compensations\".\n\n[32].\n\nThis law was further replaced by Albanian Law No. 7496 of August 4, 1992, which provided in particular:\n\nArt. 9 \"Foreign investments in Albania enjoy complete protection and guarantee. Foreign investments cannot be nationalized, expropriated, or be object of another measure equal to them including the special cases in the interest of public use and always with a legal procedure, with compensation and without discrimination. Compensation must be given immediately, be real and suitable.\n\nArt. 15 \"Disagreements between the foreign investor provided with authorization according to law and the Council of Ministers, Ministry or the Local power organs in connection to:\n\na) any question that has to do with discrimination or other question linked with compensation for reason foreseen in Art. 9 and 10 of this Law.\n\nb) Legitimacy or the continuation of legitimacy of authorization will be presented for settling to an international arbitration in accordance to rules of Arbitration Committee of UNO for the International Rights in Trade, that are in force in the time of delivery of authorization, excluding the cases when between the person that releases the authorization and the foreign investor that takes the authorization, had been agreed otherwise and this is written in the authorization. Any decision of this arbitration is of a cut form and obliged for all sides.\"\n\n[33].\n\nIn spite of certain aspects of the English translation of this law, both Parties agree that this is a submission to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n[34].\n\nMost relevant to the present case is Albanian Law No. 7764 of November 2, 1993 (the \"1993 Law\") which came into force on January 1, 1994, and which, in particular, contains the following provisions:\n\n\"Article 1   \nDecisions\n\nFor the purpose of this Act\n\n1. \"Territory\" means the territory under the sovereignty of the Republic of Albania, including the territorial waters, as well as the maritime area and the continental shelf over which the Republic Albania, in accordance with international law, exercises its sovereign and legal rights.\n\n2. \"Foreign investor\" means:\n\na) any natural person who is a citizen of a foreign country, or\n\nb) any natural person who is a citizen of the Republic of Albania with a permanent domicile in a foreign country, or\n\nc) any legal person that is incorporated or constituted under the law of a foreign country that directly or indirectly seeks to make or is making an investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania under its laws or has made an investment under the laws regarding the period of time from July 31, 1990 and further on.\n\n3. \"Foreign investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania owned directly or indirectly by a foreign investor, consisting of:\n\na) moveable and immoveable, tangible and intangible property and any other property rights;\n\nb) a company, shares in stock of a company and any form of participation in a company;\n\nc) loans, claim to money or claim to performance having economic value; (handwritten addition: \"and related with an investment\")\n\nd) intellectual property, including literary and artistic works, sound recordings, inventions, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, know how, trademarks, service marks and trade names; and\n\ne) any right conferred by law or contract, and any license or permit pursuant to law.\n\n4. \"Foreign investment dispute\" means any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to a foreign investment.\n\n5. \"Return\" means an amount derived from or associated with an investment, including profit, dividend, interest, capital gain, royalty payment, management fee, technical assistance fee or other fee, or returns in kind.\"\n\n\"Article 4  \nExpropriation and Nationalization\n\nForeign investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly or subject to any measure of tantamount effect, except for a public purpose determined on law; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation and in accordance with due process of law.\n\n\"Article 5  \nCompensation for Expropriation and Nationalization\n\n1. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or become known, whichever is earlier.\n\n2. Compensation shall be paid without delay and include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of the expropriation, be fully transferable and convertible at the market rate of exchange on the date of the expropriation.\n\n3. In cases in which a foreign investor asserts that all or part of its foreign investment has been expropriated or considers the compensation therefor to be unsatisfactory, the foreign investor shall have the right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative bodies in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of this Act.\"\n\n\"Article 8  \nDispute Settlement\n\n1. If a foreign investment dispute arises between a foreign investor and either an Albanian private party or an Albanian state enterprise, and it cannot be settled amicably, then the foreign investor may choose to submit the dispute for resolution to any applicable, previously agreed upon dispute-settlement procedure. If no dispute settlement procedure has been agreed upon, then the foreign investor may submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or administrative tribunal of the Republic of Albania in accordance with its laws.\n\n2. If a foreign investment dispute arises between a foreign investor and the Republic of Albania and it cannot be settled amicably, then the foreign investor may choose to submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or administrative tribunal of the Republic of Albania in accordance with its laws. In addition, if the dispute arises out of or relates to expropriation, compensation for expropriation, or discrimination and also for the transfers in accordance with Article 7, then the foreign investor may submit the dispute for resolution and the Republic of Albania hereby consents to the submission thereof, to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and National of Other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n3. Any arbitral award rendered in accordance with this article shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. The Republic of Albania shall carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and provide for its enforcement in its territory.\"\n\n\"Article 9   \nStatus of this Act\n\n1. Law No. 7594 of August 4, 1992, and any other provisions within laws or decisions of the Government of Albania that conflict with this Act are hereby abrogated.\n\n2. In the event that the provisions of the Act are not in conformity with any other international agreement or treaty ratified by the Parliament, to which the Republic of Albania or the Government of Albania is a party, the latter shall prevail to the extent they provide greater rights or protection to the foreign investor than those provided in this Act.\"\n\n[35].\n\nIn addition, Tradex claims that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is also based on the Bilateral Agreement between Greece and Albania for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments signed on August 1, 1991, and notified to be in force as of January 4, 1995 (the \"Bilateral Treaty\"). In particular, this Bilateral Treaty contains the following provisions:\n\n\"Article 1   \nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. \"Investment\" means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\na) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges,\n\nb) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company,\n\nc) loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value,\n\nd) intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with respect to copyrights, trademarks, trade names, patents, technological processes, know-how, and goodwill,\n\ne) rights conferred by law or under contract with a Contracting Party, including the right to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.\n\n2. \"Returns\" means the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and other fees.\n\n3. \"Investor\" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:\n\na) natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party in accordance with its law,\n\nb) legal persons constituted in accordance with the law of that Contracting Party and having their seat within its territory.\n\n4. \"Territory\" means in respect of either Contracting Party the territory under its sovereignty as well as the territorial sea and submarine areas, over which the Contracting Party exercises, in conformity with international law, sovereign rights or jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"Article 4   \nExpropriation\n\n1. Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n2. Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated investment before the date on which the actual or threatened expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure has become publicly known. The compensation shall be paid without delay and shall carry the current bank interest until the time of payment; it shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable. Provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure for the determination and payment of such compensation. The legality of any such expropriation, nationalization or comparable measure and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.\n\n3. Investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favored nation treatment in the territory of the other Contracting party in respect of the matters provided for in this Article.\"\n\n\"Article 8   \nApplication\n\nThis Agreement shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent with the latter's legislation.\"\n\n\"Article 10  \nSettlement of Disputes between an Investor and a Host State\n\n1. Any dispute between either Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning investments or the expropriation or nationalization of an investment shall, as far as possible, be settled by the disputing parties in an amicable way.\n\n2. If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement, the investor or the Contracting Party concerned may submit the dispute either to the competent court of the Contracting Party, or to an international arbitration tribunal. Each Contracting Party herewith declares its acceptance of such an arbitration procedure. In the latter case, the provisions of article 9, para 3\u20139, shall be applied mutatis mutandis. Nevertheless, the President of the Court of the International Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris shall be invited to make the necessary appointments whereas the arbitration shall determine its procedure by applying the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as then in force. The award shall be binding and enforced in accordance with domestic law.\n\n3. During arbitration or the enforcement of an award the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the objection that the investor of the other Contracting Party has received compensation under an insurance contract in respect of all or part of the damage.\n\n4. In case both Contracting Parties have become members of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the Other States, disputes between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party under the first paragraph of this Article shall be submitted for settlement by conciliation or arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.\"\n\n\"Article 13  \nEntry into Force\u2014Duration\u2014Termination\n\n1. This Agreement shall enter into force thirty days after the date on which the Contracting Parties have informed each other, through diplomatic channels, of its ratification or approval according to their respective legislation.\n\n2. Unless notice of termination has been given by either Contracting Party at least six months before the date of expiry of its validity, this Agreement shall be extended tacitly for the period of 10 years, each Contracting Party reserving the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice of at least six months before the date of expiry of the current period of validity.\n\n3. In respect of investments made prior to the date of the termination of this Agreement the foregoing Articles shall continue to be effective for a further period of 10 years from that date.\"\n\n[36].\n\nThe Tribunal will return to particular aspects of this legal framework and the respective interpretations by both Parties later in the context of its Reasons for the decision.\n\n**D. Reasons for the Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n[37].\n\nAs shortly indicated above, Albania has raised four objections to jurisdiction based on the 1993 Law and, when Tradex also relied on the Bilateral Treaty, has objected to jurisdiction on that basis as well. The Tribunal will now examine each of these objections after a brief summary of the position each Party has taken respectively. To facilitate the presentation, however, the Tribunal will take up the objections in different order to that used by the Parties.\n\n*1. The Bilateral Investment Treaty*\n------------------------------------\n\n[38].\n\nThe Tribunal will first deal with Tradex's claim that its jurisdiction is based on the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Albania and Greece. To this claim, Albania objects by pointing out that the Treaty was not in force at any relevant time to provide for jurisdiction in this procedure.\n\n[39].\n\nThe Treaty was signed on August 1, 1991, but according to its Art. 13 came into force only on January 4, 1995, as notified in the Official Gazette of the Government of Greece of February 14, 1995.\n\n[40].\n\nIts Art. 4 (2) provides that\n\n\"Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated,...\"\n\n[41].\n\nIts Art. 8 provides that the Treaty\n\n\"shall also apply to the investments made prior to its entry into force.\"\n\n[42].\n\nAnd Art. 10 (4) provides that, in case both states have become members between a Contracting Party and an investor, a dispute\n\n\"shall be submitted\" to ICSID arbitration.\n\n[43].\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in the present procedure, the Request for Arbitration is dated October 17, 1994, and was received by ICSID on November 2, 1994, i.e. well before the entry into force of the Bilateral Treaty on January 4, 1995. It is, therefore, clear that at the time of its filing the Request for Arbitration Tradex could not rely on a jurisdiction provided by the Bilateral Treaty. The only question is whether, nevertheless, the later entry into force of the Bilateral Treaty could, with delay, still be a sufficient ground to justify jurisdiction from there on for this procedure. Such a conclusion would be unusual insofar as both in national and international procedural law jurisdiction must mostly be established at the time of filing the claim. To divert from this usual result, here one might arguably rely on the provision in Art. 8 that the Treaty also applies to investments made prior to its entry into force. But this could as well be interpreted to the effect that such application to prior investments can only take place if the claim is filed after the entry into force. Indeed, this latter interpretation seems to be the appropriate one in view of the wording of both Articles 4 (2) and 10 (4) of the treaty which say that investments \"shall\" not be expropriated and that disputes \"shall\" be submitted to ICSID arbitration. From these provisions it seems clear that the Contracting Parties had the intention to only submit to ICSID jurisdiction regarding alleged expropriation and requests for arbitration occurring in the future, even if they concerned investments made earlier.\n\n[44].\n\nAs both the alleged expropriation and the Request for Arbitration in this procedure occurred before the entry into force of the Bilateral Treaty, that Treaty cannot establish jurisdiction in this case.\n\n*2. Dispute only between Tradex and T.B. Torovitsa?*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n[45].\n\nRegarding a possible jurisdiction based on the 1993 Law, first of all Albania claims that, to the extent that a \"dispute\" has arisen, it is \"patently one\" between Tradex and its joint venture partner Torovitsa. No evidence was provided that Albania either directly or indirectly expropriated the investment or played any role in commercial difficulties which led to the liquidation of the joint venture. Insofar as Tradex wanted to raise claims in that context, it should have done so against T.B. Torovitsa. But in any case, according to Albania, the proper forum would have been arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to which Art. 16 of the joint venture agreement referred.\n\n[46].\n\nTradex, on the other hand, stresses that it does not allege, in this procedure, a dispute with or an interference by T.B. Torovitsa, but that the Albanian State\u2014not T.B. Torovitsa\u2014proceeded to expropriation and equivalent measures for which compensation is due. This claim could not be brought before ICC arbitration on the basis of Art. 16 of the agreement with T.B. Torovitsa.\n\n[47].\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with both parties that any claim raised *against T.B. Torovitsa* related to obligations arising from the joint venture agreement would be outside its jurisdiction. But this, and the fact that T.B. Torovitsa is a state-owned company, does not exclude that another kind of claim is raised by Tradex against the Republic of Albania on the basis of Albania's consent to ICSID Arbitration and alleging that Albania itself has taken acts of expropriation against Tradex's investment.\n\n[48].\n\nThis is the case here where Tradex does not claim that any acts of T.B. Torovitsa should be regarded as acts of expropriation, but claims that acts or failure to act by the state of Albania itself have to be considered as an expropriation. This is the kind of dispute covered by the consent by Albania to ICSID arbitration in Art. 8 of the 1993 Law and this conclusion is not changed by the fact that the alleged expropriation is claimed by Tradex to have affected its investment in the joint venture.\n\n[49].\n\nTherefore, there is a dispute with the Republic of Albania without prejudice obviously as to whether other conditions for jurisdiction are fulfilled and whether the claim is justified on the merits.\n\n*3. Tradex no \"foreign investor\"?*\n----------------------------------\n\n[50].\n\nAlbania argues that, even if the 1993 Law would be applicable \"retroac-tively\"\u2014which will be discussed later in this decision\u2014Tradex is not a \"foreign investor\" within the meaning of the 1993 Law. On the date of entry into force of the 1993 Law, i.e. January 1, 1994, as the liquidation of the joint venture had been completed on December 16, 1993, according to Albania, Tradex could not be considered to still hold an investment at the time relevant for Albania's consent to ICSID arbitration by the 1993 Law.\n\n[51].\n\nTradex, on the other hand, considers the 1993 Law applicable.\n\n[52].\n\nThe Tribunal feels it can get sufficient guidance in this matter by the wording of the 1993 Law. Art. 1 (Definitions) of the Law expressly says, in its paragraph 2:\n\n\"Foreign investor\" means:\n\na)... or\n\nb)... or\n\nc) any legal person that is incorporated or constituted under the law of a foreign country that... has made an investment under the laws regarding the period of time from July 31, 1990 and further on.\"\n\n[53].\n\nTradex fulfills these conditions. It is incorporated in Greece. Its investment was made \"under the laws\" as confirmed by the official authorization of January 21, 1992 by the Republic of Albania. Finally, its investment was made after July 31, 1990.\n\n[54].\n\nThe clear and detailed wording under the headings \"Definitions\" and \"Foreign investor\" does not give room for further conditions, particularly does it not require that the investment still exists at the time the law comes into force or the dispute arises to qualify Tradex as a \"foreign investor\"\" within the meaning of the 1993 Law.\n\n[55].\n\nThis conclusion is without prejudice to the question of whether the consent to ICSID arbitration in Art. 8 is applicable which will be dealt with later in this decision.\n\n*4. No good faith effort to settle amicably?*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n[56].\n\nEven if the 1993 Law were applicable, Albania claims that, according to Art. 8 of the Law, ICSID arbitration can only be started after failure of a good faith effort to settle the dispute amicable, and that Tradex did not make such an effort.\n\n[57].\n\nTradex claims that Art. 8 does not require such an effort and that, in any case, it made such an effort as shown by the various letters to the Government of Albania copies of which it has submitted in this procedure.\n\n[58].\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Art. 8 (2), in its first sentence, granting access to \"a competent court or administrative tribunal of the Republic of Albania\", expressly mentions the condition for the investment dispute:\n\n\"If... it cannot be settled amicably,....\"\n\n[59].\n\nThe second sentence of Art. 8 (2), which is relevant here granting access to ICSID arbitration, does not mention amicable settlement again and starts as follows:\n\n\"In addition, if the dispute arises out of or relates to expropriation,..., then the foreign investor may submit the dispute for resolution and the Republic of Albania hereby consents to the submission therefor, to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes... \"\n\n[60].\n\nReasons can be put forward, as the Parties did, both for the view that the condition regarding amicable settlement in the first sentence should also apply to the second sentence as well as for the view that the lack of this condition in the second sentence shows it not to be a requirement for the starting of an ICSID procedure. The Tribunal, however, does not need to decide this matter, because, in its view, even assuming that a good faith effort for amicable settlement is also required before an ICSID procedure, it considers that Tradex has shown sufficiently such an effort having been made.\n\n[61].\n\nTradex has submitted copies of five letters in this procedure which are relevant in this context.\n\n[62].\n\nThe first letter of October 31, 1992 to the Ministry of Agriculture reported \"serious problems\" on the farm of the joint venture such as destructions, stealings, disobedience and threats by the workers and suggested the transfer of the investment to another farm.\n\n[63].\n\nThe second letter of December 12, 1992 reported further to the first letter to the same Ministry, and in particular that the community of Mali-Kolej detached 15 hectares of land without notice or any other decision communicated and continued:\n\n\"6. We enclose an itemized memorandum of evaluation of the positive damage, which runs to 195,851$ while the loss of future income is in the order of 717,615 $.\n\n7. After that we kindly request your interference to both following directions:\n\na. Help to the normalization of our proceedings.\n\nb. Help to the arrangements of our compensation.\"\n\n[64].\n\nThe third letter of December 12, 1992 to the same Ministry gave an evaluation of the equipment, products, and livestock Tradex held in the joint venture, reported that Tradex, from the beginning of December 1992 could not go to the farm due to \"obstacles from several persons,\" raised the risk of further damage, and then contained:\n\n\"... we consider that as necessary, to bring to your notice the problem taking into account the law Nr. 7496/4.8.1992 concerning \"Law on Foreign Investments\" as it is provided for in the article Nr. 9 which appoints: \u2018The foreign investment in Albania stand under full protection and guarantee.'\n\nFor all the abovementioned we hope for your sincere support.\"\n\n[65].\n\nTradex's fourth letter to the Ministry of Agriculture, dated January 21, 1993 referred to the former letters, mentioned that attempts to contact the Ministry otherwise had been unsuccessful and that the situation had reached a \"deadlock\" and then continued:\n\n\"... only you could give as soon as possible the right solution. We would not like to put in force the terms of the contract concerning commitments.\"\n\n[66].\n\nThe fifth letter was a memorandum dated February 25, 1993 sent to the \"Sector of Privatization\" at the Ministry of Agriculture, enclosing copies of the first four letters and giving an update and, in particular containing the following wording:\n\n\"... we feel the need to apply to you through this Memorandum to thinking out a solution.\"\n\n[67].\n\nIt suggested \"to organize a meeting to find an attainable solution as soon as possible.\"\n\n[68].\n\nThe Tribunal notes that all five letters are addressed to the Ministry, that the letters contain references to the 1992 Investment Law, to non-commercial difficulties and interference from \"outside\" the joint venture, to legal obligations, and to the amounts of possible damages, as well as a suggestion to organize a meeting for finding a solution. The Tribunal further notes that none of the letters was answered or resulted in any relevant action by Albania.\n\n[69].\n\nThe Tribunal finds these letters to be a sufficient good faith effort to reach an amicable settlement within the meaning of Art. 8 of the 1993 Law without prejudice as to whether the non-action by Albania can be considered to be an expropriation, a question which will be addressed hereafter.\n\n*5. No \"expropriation\"?*\n------------------------\n\n[70].\n\nAlbania further claims that there is no jurisdiction of this Tribunal, because the submission to ICSID arbitration in Art. 8 (2) of the 1993 Law requires a dispute arising out of or relating to \"expropriation\", and that the conduct of Albania alleged by Tradex in this case cannot be considered as expropriation. Albania points out that a full examination of the alleged expropriation can only take place in the procedure on the merits of this case, but that in this jurisdictional phase of the procedure Tradex has to provide at least prima facie evidence to show that an expropriation occurred, as required by Art. 8 (2), and that Tradex has failed to do so.\n\n[71].\n\nTradex, on the other hand, claims that the conduct of the Albanian government and particularly the lack of protection requested which led to the liquidation of the joint venture on which it relies, fulfill the requirements of Art. 8 (2) and will be supported by full evidence proving expropriation in the procedure on the merits.\n\n[72].\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the question of whether the alleged conduct of Albania can be considered an expropriation is on one hand relevant under Art. 8 (2) for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and is on the other hand the decisive issue relevant under Articles 4 and 5 of the 1993 Law or Articles 9 and 10 of the 1992 Law to decide on the merits of Tradex's claim. At least it cannot be excluded that under certain circumstances it would be considered an expropriation if a state permits the deprivation of land use from a joint venture based on foreign investment or fails to grant protection against interference if a legal duty for protection can be found to exist. But the Tribunal feels a further examination of this matter in the context of establishing jurisdiction according to Art. 8 (2) would be so closely related to the further examination of the merits in this case that this jurisdictional examination should be joined to the merits.\n\n[73].\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal decides, as it is authorized by Art. 41 (4) 2nd sentence of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that this objection should be joined to the merits of the dispute, should the Tribunal find that the other objections to jurisdiction raised in this case cannot be accepted and thus this procedure is continued on the merits.\n\n*6. No \"retroactive\" application of 1993 Law?*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n[74].\n\nBoth Parties have argued extensively regarding Albania's objection to jurisdiction to the effect that the 1993 Law could not be applied \"retroactively\". To avoid repetition, the Tribunal will deal with these arguments within the scope of its own reasoning insofar as its considers them relevant.\n\n[75].\n\nFirst of all the Tribunal sees only a limited relevance of a general discussion of possible retroactive application of national laws and international instruments in the context of this procedure. On one hand already there does not seem to be a common terminology as to what is \"retroactive\" application, and also the solutions found in substantive and procedural national and international law in this regard seem to make it very difficult, if at all possible, to agree on a common denominator as to where \"retroactive\" application is permissible and where not. What is at stake here is no more and no less than the question of whether the submission by Albania in Art. 8 of the 1993 Law to ICSID arbitration justifies jurisdiction under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention in this case, irrespective of whether this should be considered a \"retroactive\" application. The Tribunal will, therefore, concentrate on the criteria established by Art. 8 and Art. 25. This does not exclude that, in interpreting these criteria, it could be found useful to take into account also provisions found in other Articles of the 1993 Law, in other laws, and in international instruments as well as in decisions of national courts or international tribunals.\n\n[76].\n\nThis analysis has to be done, insofar as it is relevant, in the context of the specific circumstances of this case. Thus it has to be recalled in particular that:\n\nTradex made its investments starting in 1992;\n\nthe conduct of Albania alleged to be an expropriation occurred in 1992 and 1993;\n\nthe Albanian investment laws in force during that period were those of August 10, 1991 and August 4, 1992;\n\nthe liquidation of the joint venture was completed on December 16, 1993;\n\nTradex's five letters to the Ministry of Agriculture were dated between October 31, 1992 and February 25, 1993;\n\nthe 1993 Law entered into force on January 1, 1994; and\n\nthe Request for Arbitration was received by ICSID on November 2, 1994.\n\n[77].\n\nStarting with Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal notes that, although consent by written agreement is the usual method of submission to ICSID jurisdiction, it can now be considered as established and not requiring further reasoning that such consent can also be effected unilaterally by a Contracting State in its national laws the consent becoming effective at the latest if and when the foreign investor files its claim with ICSID making use of the respective national law. Therefore, the 1993 Law together with Tradex's Request for Arbitration must be considered as sufficient consent\u2014if the submission in the 1993 Law is applicable as is examined hereafter.\n\n[78].\n\nThe conclusion reached by the Tribunal is supported by the similar conclusion reached by another ICSID arbitral tribunal in the case Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, Decisions on jurisdiction dated 27 November 1985 (3 ICSID Reports, at 112 et seq.) and April 14, 1988 (3 ICSID Reports, at 131 et seq.), where the consent of Egypt to ICSID arbitration and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal was based on Art. 8 of the Egyptian law n. 43 of 1974. That Tribunal considered that such piece of legislation constituted, on the side of Egypt, the \"consent in writing\" required by Art. 25 of the Washington Convention. The Tribunal based its conclusion on the interpretation offered in the Report to the Executive Directors, accompanying the Convention, which explains that \"a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes... to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give its consent by accepting the offer in writing (ICSID Docments concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, Vol. II, P.2, at 1069).\n\n[79].\n\nIn the present case the formulation of Art. 8 of the Albanian Investment Law of 1993 is surely more clear than the corresponding Art. 8 of the Egyptian law mentioned above. Art.8, par. 2, of the 1993 Albanian Law states unambiguously that \"The Republic of Albania hereby consents to the submission thereof to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes\".\n\n[80].\n\nIt is conclusively to be added that this point appears uncontested by the Republic of Albania which challenges the jurisdiction of this Tribunal not on the ground of its lack of acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction through Art. 8 (2) of the 1993 Law, but on the ground of its evaluation of the effect in time of such acceptance, which the Republic of Albania considers restricted to the disputes arisen after the entry into force of the 1993 Law.\n\n[81].\n\nRegarding the application of Art. 8 (2) of the 1993 Law, its first two criteria mentioned have already been found above to be fulfilled: There is a \"foreign investment dispute... between a foreign investor and the Republic of Albania\". And, assumed that it is a condition, Tradex has made a good faith effort for an amicable settlement. Art. 8 (2), in its second sentence, which contains the submission to ICSID arbitration, requires further that the dispute arises out of or relates to \"expropriation...\". This criteria was dealt with above in this decision to the effect that it would be joined to the merits, should jurisdiction be otherwise established.\n\n[82].\n\nRegarding the \"retroactivity\"-issue the first question is *when* the dispute \"arose\" in this case. If the time of the Request for Arbitration is decisive in this regard, as Tradex's Request was filed in November 1994 after the coming into force of the 1993 Law, jurisdiction would be established. As seen above, for application of the Bilateral Treaty, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the date of filing the Request for Arbitration was considered to be the relevant date. And it might well be argued that a dispute is only identified sufficiently for an arbitration, once the Request for Arbitration is filed. But the wording and criteria used by the Treaty, i.e. \"shall be submitted\" to ICSID arbitration, differs considerably from Art. 8 where the criteria is when \"the dispute arises\". It might perhaps still be argued that the unilateral submission to ICSID arbitration by the 1993 Law only turns into the consent required by Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention by the filing of the Request for Arbitration by the investor who thereby notifies that he wants to use this option, but Art. 8 gives no indication that the time of this consent should be considered to be the date when \"the dispute arises\".\n\n[83].\n\nIn its contention that it did make a good faith effort to settle the dispute amicably, Tradex itself pointed out that already its 5 letters of late 1992 and early 1993 raise the claim against Albania. And, as seen above, the Tribunal agrees with this. As a consequence, in interpreting the same Art. 8 (2) regarding both aspects, the dispute must be considered to have \"arisen\" at that time, because one obviously cannot make an effort to settle amicably a dispute which has not yet arisen.\n\n[84].\n\nThe term \"arise\" indicates that the beginning of the dispute is relevant and the term \"dispute\" is rather general and would usually be understood not to be restricted to a legal procedure. Thus the complaints raised in the five letters by Tradex to the Ministry in 1992 and 1993 would already have to be considered as the \"arising\" of the dispute. Furthermore, irrespective of whether a good faith effort for amicable settlement is required also before submission to ICSID under the second sentence of Art. 8 (2), it cannot be disregarded that already the first sentence uses the identical wording \"dispute arises\" and there it is obviously meant to refer to a time before the start of actual legal proceedings, because otherwise the requirement for an effort to settle amicably would not make sense. Therefore, it must be concluded that the \"dispute arises\" within the meaning of Art. 8 not at the time of the Request for Arbitration to ICSID, but already when substantive complaints were communicated by Tradex in its letters to the Ministry in 1992 and 1993 before the coming into force of the 1993 Law.\n\n[85].\n\nIt must therefore now be examined whether such an earlier dispute is covered by the submission to ICSID in Art. 8.\n\n[86].\n\nThe time element which is subject of the arguments of the Parties on \"retroactivity\" is first of all related to the wording in Art. 8 (2) 2nd sentence: \"In addition, *if* the dispute *arises* out of..., then the foreign investor may submit...\" (emphasis added). The term \"arises\" would seem to indicate a time in the present or in the future after the coming into force of the 1993 Law, as the legislator has not chosen wording such as \"has arisen\". On the other hand, the term \"if\", by which it is introduced could be understood either as a conditional or a time element, while, had the legislator chosen the term \"when\" instead, clearly only a time element would have been introduced. In particular, the combination of the terms \"arises out of or relates to\" speaks in favour of a conditional element. Particularly, as the two criteria are connected by the term \"or\", this combination indicates that the words \"arises out of\"\u2014similar and supplemental to \"relates to\"\u2014are meant to describe a substantive relationship between the dispute on one hand and the alleged \"expropriation\" etc. on the other hand. It is a combination of terms found frequently in arbitration clauses describing the required relationship between the contract and the dispute to establish jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. An illustration is the Model Arbitration Clause recommended by UNCITRAL which starts: \"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract,... shall be settled by arbitration...\". Considering these various arguments together, the Tribunal concludes that the wording speaks in favour of an interpretation as a conditional element and that, based on the mere wording of Art. 8, the dispute must not have arisen after the entry into force of the 1993 Law.\n\n[87].\n\nThus, the evaluation of the wording of Art. 8 leads the Tribunal to the preliminary conclusion that a dispute which started before the coming into force of the 1993 Law can be covered by the submission to ICSID jurisdiction. Now the Tribunal will have to examine whether this preliminary result based on the wording of Art. 8 is affected by further considerations for the interpretation of the 1993 Law. Such an additional examination seems particularly appropriate here as the above evaluation of the wording of Art. 8 is based on its translation into English, which, though it is not challenged by either Party and neither Party has relied on the text in the Albanian language, may not in all nuances be identical with the text in the Albanian language.\n\n[88].\n\nAn express reference to acts predating the effective date of the 1993 Law is found in Art. 1 (2) c of the 1993 Law by which a \"foreign investor\" qualifies for application of the Law, if he \"has made an investment... from July 31, 1990 and further on\". While, as described above, thereby Tradex clearly qualifies as a \"foreign investor\", this does not necessarily also require that any dispute arising after July 31, 1990 can also be submitted to ICSID arbitration under Art. 8. For, contrary to terms \"or has made\" in Art. 1 (2) c, as seen above, Art. 8 (2) twice uses the term \"arises\" and one might have expected the terms \"or has arisen\" had the legislator wanted to include earlier disputes there as well. It is important to note, however, that the date mentioned in Art. 1 (2) d, i.e. July 31, 1990 is identical with the date at which the first Albanian Decree on Foreign Investment came into force. Thus it seems to have been the intention of the legislator that all investments made thereafter under the Albanian investment laws of 1990, 1991, and 1992 and governed by such laws should now qualify for the new protection of the 1993 Law after its coming into force. However, as far as disputes regarding such earlier investments are concerned, excluding earlier disputes in Art. 8 would not be in contradiction to the inclusion of earlier investments under Art. 1, because it would be an understandable interpretation that, if a dispute started after the entry into force of the 1993 Law regarding a foreign investment made earlier, this should now fall under ICSID jurisdiction, while disputes starting before such entry into force, for which the preceding investment laws provided other jurisdictions for dispute settlement, should remain in that jurisdiction. It would, therefore, seem to the Tribunal that consideration of Art. 1 of the 1993 Law does not necessitate an interpretation of Art. 8 (2) 2 to the effect that all earlier disputes must also fall under ICSID jurisdiction. But on the other hand, the reference to earlier investments in Art. 1 could more convincingly be interpreted as an argument in favour of a similar application of Art. 8 so that not only the new substantive protection of the 1993 Law, but also the new procedural protection of that law, i.e. ICSID jurisdiction, should now apply. This latter interpretation seems more plausible to the Tribunal, because it would save both the investor and Albania the need to engage two procedures and tribunals possibly regarding the same investment should one dispute start before and another start after the coming into force of the 1993 Law.\n\n[89].\n\nArt. 2 (2) of the 1993 Law provides that \"foreign investment\" shall receive fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security\" and Art. 4 provides that foreign investments \"shall not be expropriated...\". The continuous use of the term \"shall\" includes an element of a legal undertaking as well as a time element and it does not seem possible to the Tribunal to interpret it as a retroactive commitment by Albania for conduct in the past before the entry into force of the 1993 Law. However, the difference in the wording in Art. 8 is obvious in that it does not indicate such a time element referring only to future disputes. On the other hand, the prospective application of Art. 2 discussed above is easily reconcilable with the application of Art. 8 to earlier disputes, because it occurs frequently that courts and arbitral tribunals have to apply certain substantive rules of law which were in force during the relevant period though they have been replaced by new rules as from a certain date. Accepting ICSID jurisdiction for the present dispute under Art. 8, therefore, by no means implies that the substantive protection rules of the 1993 Law would be applicable in the consideration of the merits of this case.\n\n[90].\n\nArt. 9 (1) of the 1993 Law provides that \"Law No. 7594 of August 4, 1992, and any other provisions within laws or decisions of the Government of Albania that conflict with this Act are hereby abrogated\". Regarding Tradex's investments, as these were made in 1992, the 1992 Law provided for UNCITRAL arbitration for claims regarding compensation for expropriation. As both, the 1992 Law and the 1993 Law, due to its Art. 1 (2) c, apply to earlier investments before January 1, 1994, a conflict within the meaning of Art. 9 of the 1993 Law could be seen if an expropriation dispute could be submitted both to ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitration, at least if one would not conclude that both options should be open to an investor. If the submission to ICSID arbitration in Art. 8 would only apply to disputes that have arisen after the entry into force of the 1993 Law, there would also be no conflict, because such earlier disputes could only be submitted to UNCITRAL arbitration on the basis of the 1992 Law. But again, it is more plausible to the Tribunal to interpret the legislative intention of Art. 9 to the effect that after the coming into force of the 1993 law the submission of a foreign investment dispute to ICSID arbitration should cover also disputes that started earlier, rather than both the investor and Albania having possibly to engage in two parallel arbitration procedures, under the UNCITRAL Rules and under the ICSID Rules, regarding the same investment.\n\n[91].\n\nThe interpretation of Art. 8 and Art. 9 of the 1993 Albanian Law adopted by the Tribunal appears confirmed by the developments in the Albanian investment laws of 1990, 1992 and 1993. Clearly, there has been a continuous evolution of such investment laws to assure a constantly better protection of the investments; this explains why an investment made in 1990 does not remain submitted to the rules in force at the moment in which it was made, but is subsequently submitted to the new rules. The succession in time of dispute settlement mechanisms is to be evaluated in such a context of progressive evolution. It is consistent with this evolution that the new dispute settlement mechanisms, which are more advanced and efficient, as the recourse to ICSID provided by Art. 8 of the 1993 Law, can be used also in relation to investments made and for disputes arisen before the entry into force of such law, the only negative condition being that previous procedures to settle the dispute have not yet been operated. This solution is moreover confirmed by Art. 9 of the 1993 Law abrogating all incompatible rules existing in previous legislation.\n\n[92].\n\nIn regarding its conclusion on this issue of \"retroactivity\", the Tribunal also gave consideration to further arguments raised by the Parties, as follows:\n\n[93].\n\nTradex has pointed out that, when the substantive law is retroactive, the law of procedural remedies must be retroactive as well, unless otherwise provided. While this may be generally correct, as Tradex itself mentions, a law can provide otherwise. Indeed, the above interpretation of the 1993 Law comes to the conclusion that the limited \"retroactivity\" provided by Art. 1 (2) speaks in favour of a similar retroactivity of Art. 8.\n\n[94].\n\nTradex has further pointed out that it is a general principle of international and national transitional law in procedural matters that new provisions cover disputes as well regarding earlier acts and that courts are entitled and obliged to apply new procedural law also to events prior to its coming into force. In that context, Tradex has referred to procedural law and jurisprudence in certain countries such as Germany, to the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, and to bilateral conventions on judicial assistance. The Tribunal does not have to enter into a discussion of these general principles, which might perhaps be of relevance if new procedural rules were enacted regarding ICSID Tribunals. But at stake here is the question of submission to ICSID jurisdiction which must be established before any procedural rules can be applied. While jurisdiction of courts does not depend on submission by the parties, but is decided by law, jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal exists only if and insofar as the parties have expressed their submission to it. This submission must, therefore, be interpreted and found to exist in every given case, and that examination is exactly what has been done above in the interpretation of Art. 8. A comparable situation in court procedure might be if a party relies on a forum clause in a contract, but that is a comparison not used by Tradex, and the Tribunal sees no reason to go into it as well.\n\n[95].\n\nAlbania has pointed out that, should the jurisdiction of this Tribunal be accepted regarding alleged expropriations before the coming into force of the 1993 Law, this would mean that either the Tribunal would be called upon to apply the 1992 Law in force at that time, or that the substantive rules of the 1993 Law should also apply retroactively, and that neither conclusion could be correct. The Tribunal agrees that, in principle, the substantive rules of the 1992 Law are related to the submission to UNCITRAL arbitration in that law, and that those of the 1993 Law must be seen in relation to the submission to ICSID arbitration in that law. But still, in view of the specific provisions regarding earlier investments in Art. 1 (2) c and regarding earlier laws in Art. 9, the Tribunal gives more weight to the specific interpretation of Art. 8 (2) which the Tribunal has adopted above.\n\n[96].\n\nAlbania has further pointed out that it is a well established principle of Albanian law that legislation will not apply retroactively unless expressly provided for (with certain exceptions in penal law not relevant here) and that there is no case in which an Albanian law has been applied retroactively. And Albania has added that this presumption for non-retroactivity in Albanian law is consistent with principles of general international law, supported by international jurisprudence, and by analogy to the protection of investment property rights in human rights law.\n\n[97].\n\nAlthough such a presumption may indeed be found, the Tribunal considers that it need not enter into a detailed examination of the existence and extent of such a presumption. Its examination of the 1993 Law was based on the consideration that ICSID jurisdiction could only be established by an express submission by Albania. Then the Tribunal dealt specifically with the question of whether the express submission to ICSID arbitration in Art. 8 (2) covered the alleged earlier expropriations in this case, irrespective of whether this should be considered a \"retroactive\" application or not.\n\n[98].\n\nAlbania has also argued that a submission to arbitration must be presumed to be only meant for future disputes unless otherwise expressed. The Tribunal is not convinced that such a presumption can be established in international arbitration. Submissions to arbitration, both in arbitration between states and in international commercial arbitration, are found in practice both regarding disputes that have already arisen and regarding future disputes. In a number of national legal systems, the traditional approach was even that a valid and binding submission to arbitration could only be expressed, after a dispute had arisen. Without the guidance of such an alleged presumption, therefore, the Tribunal has to interpret the specific submission in Art. 8 (2) relevant here as to whether it applies to the dispute in this case. As seen above, the Tribunal finds that this interpretation confirms ICSID jurisdiction in this case.\n\n[99].\n\nFinally, some more general considerations may also be taken into account. In several instances Albania has expressly pointed out to the Tribunal that it confirms its commitment to the full protection of foreign investment in Albania, to the ICSID system, and to its international legal obligations. The 1993 Law, its contents and particularly the changes it introduced compared to the preceding investment laws, is an illustration of this confirmation expressed by Albania. It would, therefore, seem appropriate to at least take into account, though not as a decisive factor by itself but rather as a confirming factor, that in case of doubt the 1993 Law should rather be interpreted in favour of investor protection and in favour of ICSID jurisdiction in particular. Furthermore, a finding that ICSID jurisdiction does not exist in the present case would obviously lead to the question of whether the UNCITRAL Rules jurisdiction of the 1992 Law would then be available to the investor Tradex. In that respect, in response to a specific question raised by counsel for Tradex first in the oral hearing and later in his letter of September 25, 1996, Albania has chosen not to express any binding answer. Although there is, of course, no legal duty of Albania to express itself in this ICSID procedure as to whether it would accept or also object to jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules should Tradex commence such a procedure, by choosing not to express itself on this question, Albania leaves the option open that again it would contest jurisdiction in such a procedure. It would seem to the Tribunal that the availability of at least one of these two procedural means is a major aspect of the protection of foreign investors. Interpreting, as done above by the Tribunal, the submission to ICSID jurisdiction in Art. 8 of the 1993 Law to cover also this dispute for which UNCITRAL jurisdiction has not been accepted by Albania, would, therefore, also be consistent with the express statements by Albania in favour of investors' protection and ICSID arbitration and the legislative pattern in its foreign investment laws in favour of investors' protection. Furthermore, it would save not only Tradex, but also Albania, the additional considerable efforts and costs that would be necessary for a new procedure under the UNCITRAL Rules regarding the same dispute. These general considerations, therefore, though not decisive, support the conclusion reached above by the Tribunal on the application of Art. 8 of the 1993 Law.\n\n[100].\n\nRegarding this objection to jurisdiction, therefore, at the end of its own considerations and of the examination of further arguments put forward by the Parties, the Tribunal finds, irrespective of whether this should be considered a \"retroactive\" application or not, that the conditions for submission to ICSID arbitration in Art. 8 (2) of the 1993 Law are fulfilled.\n\n*7. Conclusion on Jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------\n\n[101].\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that its jurisdiction is established on the basis of the 1993 Law, except that the issue is joined to the merits whether or not an \"expropriation\" has been shown as required by the 1993 Law.\n\n*8. Further Procedure*\n----------------------\n\n[102].\n\nRegarding the following procedure on the merits, the Tribunal feels both parties should first be heard, in particular as to which periods of time they require to file their submissions. Thereafter, a procedural order will be issued.\n\n**E. Decision**\n---------------\n\n[103].\n\n1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction subject to the following: The issue as to whether or not an \"expropriation\" has been shown as required by the 1993 Law is joined to the merits of this case.\n\n[104].\n\n2. After consultation with both Parties a procedural order will be issued regarding the further procedure."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "1999-04-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**ABBREVIATIONS USED**\n----------------------\n\nFor the many references made in this Award to the file of the Case, for convenience and shortness the Tribunal will use the following abbreviations:\n\nArt. = Article of 1993 Law  \nA I = Albania's Counter Memorial of 28.12.97  \nA II = Albania's Rejoinder of 2.3.98  \nA III = Albania's Post-Hearing Memorandum of 8.12.98  \nA I Exh. 1 seq. = Exhibits submitted by Albania with A I  \nA II Exh. 1 seq. = Exhibits submitted by Albania with A II  \nH I-III = Handouts by Parties at the Hearing  \nJ = Decision on Jurisdiction 24.12.96  \nT I = Tradex' Request for Arbitration of 17.10.94  \nT II = Tradex' Memorandum of 8.7.98  \nT III = Tradex' 2nd Memorandum of 27.1.98  \nT IV = Tradex' 3rd Memorandum of 25.6.98  \nT V = Tradex' Post-Hearing Memorandum of 4.12.98  \nT 1 seq. = Exhibits submitted by Tradex  \nTr = Transcript of Final Hearing\n\n**A.

Therefore, any references to the file of the case, by using the abbreviations or otherwise, are not meant to be exhaustive. The Tribunal has taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony in this case insofar as it considered them relevant.\n\n**B. Procedure**\n----------------\n\n*1. Procedure Leading to Decision on Jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 November 1994, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) received from Tradex a Request for Arbitration against Albania. The Request asserted a claim for compensation for an alleged expropriation in Albania. Details of the Request and the Claim are described in a later section of this Award.\n\n6.\n\nIn the absence of agreement upon the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment more than 60 days after the registration of the Request, Tradex chose the formula provided for in Art. 37 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention, i.e. a tribunal consisting of three arbitrators, one appointed by Tradex, one appointed by the Republic of Albania and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties. By letter dated 6 June 1995, Tradex appointed as arbitrator in this case Fred F. Fielding, Esquire, a US national. Mr. Fielding subsequently accepted his appointment.\n\n7.\n\nThough ICSID in various ways communicated the Request for Arbitration and subsequent correspondence to Albania, no appointment of the second arbitrator was received from Albania, and no agreement was reached between the Parties with respect to the appointment of the third arbitrator. As Art. 38 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 4 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide that, if the tribunal has not been constituted within 90 days after the notice of registration of the Arbitration Request, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council shall, at the request of either party and after consulting both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator(s) not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to be President of the tribunal, Tradex requested ICSID to appoint the other two arbitrators.\n\n8.\n\nIn December 1995, after notifying the Parties, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appointed Prof. Andrea Giardina, an Italian citizen, as the second arbitrator and Prof. Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, a German citizen, as the third arbitrator and President of the tribunal. Both accepted the appointment.\n\n9.\n\nBy a decision of 26 December 1995, the Council of Ministers of Albania accepted the appointments of Prof. Giardina and Prof. Bockstiegel as arbitrators and charged the Ministry of Agriculture and Food with representing the Republic of Albania in the proceedings.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal scheduled a first session with the Parties for 27 February 1996, in Washington. After consultation with the Parties and with their agreement, the session in Washington was cancelled and instead the first session of the Tribunal with the Parties was scheduled to take place in Frankfurt (Germany) on 10 April 1996.\n\n11.\n\nAt that session, in addition to other procedural details discussed and agreed, it was agreed that subsequent meetings of the Tribunal with the Parties would take place in London. Also at the session, counsel for Albania confirmed that Albania would shortly be sending to the Centre written objections to jurisdiction in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(1). Counsel for Albania gave a summary presentation of the grounds on which such objections would be based. Counsel for Tradex responded. Thereafter the proceedings on the merits were suspended in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3). Dates for written submissions by the Parties were agreed upon and it was also provisionally agreed that an oral hearing on jurisdiction would take place in London on 10 September 1996.\n\n12.\n\nAfter the session in Frankfurt, written submissions by Albania were received dated 15 April 1996, 10 June 1996, and 9 August 1996, and written submissions by Tradex were received dated 31 May 1996 and 30 July 1996.\n\n13.\n\nAt the Hearing in London on 10 September 1996, after an introduction by the President of the Tribunal regarding procedural matters, both Parties made presentations regarding jurisdiction, responded to the other Party's presentation in several rounds and answered questions by members of the Tribunal regarding certain factual or legal aspects related to jurisdiction. Also during the Hearing, Tradex asked whether Albania, in view of its objections to ICSID jurisdiction, was ready to accept this case under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as provided for in the Albanian Investment Protection Law of 1992. Counsel for Albania responded that they were not authorized to express any commitment of Albania regarding submission to UNCITRAL arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nBy a letter dated 25 September 1996 addressed to Albania represented by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Counsel for Tradex asked for a binding answer by Albania regarding acceptance of UNCITRAL arbitration in this controversy and added that, if no answer was received within 30 days, he would interpret this to the effect that Albania \"has not preferred the arbitration of UNCITRAL\".\n\n15.\n\nBy a letter dated 8 November 1996 to ICSID, Counsel for Tradex confirmed that no answer had been received from Albania.\n\n16.\n\nOn 5 December 1996, ICSID provided the Tribunal with a copy it had received of a letter dated 2 December 1996 from Counsel for Albania to Counsel for Tradex containing the following wording:\n\n\"I am instructed by the Minister to respond to your letter of 25 September 1996.\n\nAs indicated during the hearing held in London on 10 September 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Albania considers that the dispute settlement rules applicable to the facts raised in Tradex' Request for ICSID arbitration, if any, are those set forth in Law No. 7594 of 4 August 1992.\n\nArticle 15 of the 1992 Law is therefore applicable. It provides for UNCITRAL arbitration and sets forth certain conditions and exclusions for such arbitration to be effective. Whether those conditions or exclusions have been satisfied or are applicable in respect of the matter brought by Tradex to ICSID raises questions of fact and law which would need to be considered further by the Ministry of Agriculture and eventually by any arbitral Tribunal that might be constituted pursuant to the 1992 Law. In the first place it will be a matter for Tradex whether to decide to make an application for arbitration under UNCITRAL rules in reliance of the 1992 Law.\"\n\n17.\n\nThereafter, having deliberated by correspondence and in a meeting in New York on 14 November 1996, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction dated 24 December 1996 as follows:\n\n\"1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction subject to the following: The issue as to whether or not an \"expropriation\" has been shown as required by the 1993 Law is joined to the merits of this case.\n\n2. After consultation with both Parties a procedural order will be issued regarding the further procedure.\"\n\n*2. Procedure Leading to Award on Mer* its\n------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nBy a Procedural Order of 21 January 1997 the Tribunal informed the Parties of its intention regarding the further procedure on the merits, in particular regarding a possible schedule and the format and length of the Hearing, and asked for any comments from the Parties.\n\n19.\n\nHaving received such comments from Tradex and Albania by letters of 23 and 30 January 1997 respectively, the Tribunal then, by its Procedural Order of 7 February 1997, set a schedule for further filings by the Parties leading to a Final Hearing to be held from 29 September to 2 October 1997.\n\n20.\n\nWhen Albania submitted a request for postponement dated 12 March 1997, and after Tradex had submitted its comments dated 26 March 1997, the Tribunal, by its Procedural Order of 7 April 1997, set a new schedule postponing the time limits for the Parties' submissions by 3 months, indicating at the same time that new dates for a Hearing would be set at a later stage after consultation with the Parties.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 September 1997, Albania submitted a request for a further postponement on which Tradex submitted its comments dated 10 September 1997. Taking these into account, the Tribunal, by its Procedural Order of 16 September 1997, set a new time schedule for filings from the Parties and suggested 28 April to 1 May 1998 as the new Hearing dates, subject to comments from the Parties.\n\n22.\n\nWith the agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal then, by its Procedural Order of 22 September 1997, confirmed these dates for the Hearing to be held in London.\n\n23.\n\nAfter receiving Albania's Counter Memorial of 28 December 1997 and letters from Tradex of 8 and 9 January 1998 respectively, the Tribunal, by its Procedural Order of 9 January 1998, confirmed that, as expressly indicated in its previous Procedural Orders, the filings of both Parties were to deal with \"all aspects of the merits\" and the Final Hearing would deal with \"all factual and legal aspects of the case\", including the quantum of damages.\n\n24.\n\nBy its Procedural Order of 20 March 1998, the Tribunal, in conformity with its earlier Procedural Orders, provided the Parties with further details regarding the logistics and format of the Hearing and ruled on certain procedural requests that the Parties had submitted.\n\n25.\n\nAfter some further submissions from the Parties regarding, in particular, the admissibility of certain witness testimony and arguments and evidence on the quantum of damages, the Tribunal, by its Procedural Orders of 13 and 16 April 1998, ruled on the respective objections and decided that the Hearing should not be postponed.\n\n26.\n\nHaving been informed by the Parties that visas to enter the United Kingdom for the purpose of giving evidence at the Hearing had not been granted to the Parties' witnesses of Albanian nationality, with the agreement of both Parties, the Tribunal, by its Procedural Order of 23 April 1998, postponed the Hearing to dates to be established later after contact with the Parties.\n\n27.\n\nIn consultations between the Tribunal and the Parties, it became clear that the period of 5 to 8 October 1998 provided the earliest set of dates when all members of the Tribunal and the representatives and witnesses of the Parties would be available for a Hearing. Accordingly, by its Procedural Order of 6 May 1998, the Tribunal rescheduled the Hearing to those dates. By the same Order, the Tribunal ruled that, in view of the late submission of certain arguments and evidence on the quantum of damages by Albania, Tradex was authorized to file a final submission on damages by 30 June 1998.\n\n28.\n\nResponding to submissions by the Parties of 9 and 13 July 1998 respectively, the Tribunal, by its Procedural Order of 14 July 1998 ruled that it would only consider the final submission by Tradex insofar as it dealt with damages and that the Tribunal, in addition to the 4 days previously foreseen for the Hearing, would be available for a 5th day, should that become necessary.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal's Procedural Order of 21 September 1998, in conformity with previous Orders, provided the Parties with some additional details regarding the logistics and format of the Hearing.\n\n30.\n\nThe Hearing was held in London at the seat of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). It started in the morning of 5 October 1998 and was concluded on 8 October 1998 after the Parties had made their final oral presentations and it was agreed that the additional time reserved as a precaution for the Hearing was not needed.\n\n31.\n\nA transcript was made of the Hearing which records the following as attending:\n\n**Tribunal Members**\n\n1. Professor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, President  \n 2. Fred F. Fielding, Esquire  \n 3. Professor Andrea Giardina\n\n**Secretary of the Tribunal**\n\n4. Mrs. Margrete L. Stevens\n\n**Tradex Hellas S.A.**\n\n5. Professor L. Georgakopoulos  \n 6. Mr. E. Spinelis  \n 7. Mr. C. Azas  \n 8. Mr. S. Hadjigeorgiou  \n 9. Mr. D. Stergioulas  \n 10. Mr. S.

Mr. Frank Alexander  \n 25. Professor Saul Estrin\n\n**Interpreters**\n\nDr. Z. Tofallis, Greek Interpreter  \n Mr. Gezim Guri, Albanian Interpreter\n\n32.\n\nThe following Agenda had been indicated in previous Procedural Orders to the Parties and was implemented at the Hearing:\n\n1. Introduction by the President of the Tribunal  \n 2. First Round Presentation by Tradex  \n 3. First Round Presentation by Albania  \n 4. Questions by Arbitrators  \n 5. Rebuttal Presentation by Tradex  \n 6. Rebuttal Presentation by Albania  \n 7. Further Questions by Arbitrators\n\n33.\n\nIn his introduction, the President of the Tribunal recalled again the major rulings regarding the Hearing which had been included in previous Procedural Orders of the Tribunal starting with the Order of 21 January 1997. In particular, he reminded the Parties that both Parties would be given equal periods of time for their first round and rebuttal presentations and that each Party would be free to determine how much of its time it would spend on the presentation of evidence, including witnesses and experts, on arguments, and on cross-examination of witnesses and experts presented by the other Party.\n\n34.\n\nThere was some discussion on preliminary procedural matters (see Tr 7 seq.; Tr 17 and Handout H I Tradex). In particular as a preliminary matter, Tradex requested not to admit the testimony of witnesses Ujka and Ndoci because, as Tradex alleged, these testimonies were partly based on forged documents and partly contradicted by their own documents to the effect that their admission would be \"contrary to the principles of fair trial\". Albania objected. The Tribunal, after a short internal deliberation, ruled that all witnesses should be heard including the two objected to by Tradex, and that the points raised by Tradex in this context could be raised in cross-examination of the witnesses which would be taken into account by the Tribunal in evaluating the evidence.\n\n35.\n\nDuring the same preliminary procedural discussion (Tr 9 + 10), Albania withdrew objections it had earlier raised to the admissibility of certain documents filed by Tradex with its last submission. On that basis, with the consent of both Parties, the President stated that all documents submitted up to now, including their English translations, were ruled to be admissible.\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties then made their presentations as provided in the Agenda using the time available to them at their discretion for factual and legal arguments and for examination and cross-examination of witnesses. During the two rounds of presentations the following witnesses and expert witnesses were examined by the presenting Party, cross-examined by the other Party and questioned by members of the Tribunal:\n\n**Witnesses presented by Tradex:**\n\nMr. C. Azas  \n Mr. S. Lapardhaja  \n Mr. D. Stergioulas  \n Mr. S. Hadjigeorgiou\n\n**Witnesses presented by Albania** :\n\nMr. M. Ndoci   \nMr. N. Ujka   \nMr. E. Lohja   \nMr. F. Alexander   \nProf. S. Estrin\n\n37.\n\nThe Hearing was concluded by final questions by members of the Tribunal and final remarks by the President of the Tribunal including the rulings mentioned hereafter.\n\n38.\n\nRegarding the details of the Hearing, which cannot be repeated in this Award, reference is made to the transcript of the Hearing. However, specific aspects of the Hearing which the Tribunal considers as of major relevance in coming to its decision, will to some extent be mentioned in the Section \"Summary of Major Facts and Contentions\" and to some extent in the Section \"Reasons for the Decision\" in this Award.\n\n39.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal ruled that\n\n\u2013 the transcript, when available, would be transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat simultaneously to the Parties and the members of the Tribunal,\n\n\u2013 the Parties had 4 weeks after receiving the transcript to file Post-Hearing Memoranda with their final comments on the results of the Hearing and any errata in the transcript, but that no new documents could be submitted at that stage.\n\n40.\n\nIn concluding the Hearing, the President expressed the gratitude of the Tribunal to the representatives of the Parties for their professional participation in the Hearing and to Mrs. Stevens of the ICSID Secretariat for the efficient administrative support.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of November 6, 1998, the ICSID Secretariat distributed the transcript of the Hearing to the Parties and the members of the Tribunal, indicating that, in accordance with the ruling of the Tribunal, the Post-Hearing Memoranda by the Parties were due at the latest by 9 December 1998.\n\n42.\n\nWithin that time limit, the Memoranda were submitted by Tradex dated 4 December 1998 and by Albania dated 8 December 1998.\n\n43.\n\nFurthermore, with an additional letter of 4 December 1998, Tradex submitted 11 attachments containing correspondence in the period between 10 March and 11 June 1997 as evidence \"that negotiations took place towards settlement\". Albania objected to this submission by letter of 18 December 1998 and, by Procedural Order of 21 December 1998, the Tribunal ruled the submission to be inadmissible in view of its express earlier ruling that no new documents could be submitted by the Parties at this stage. This ruling is confirmed with reasons, in the next subsequent Section of this Award.\n\n44.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal entered into deliberations by written communications and meeting in person in Bergisch-Gladbach (Germany) on 20 and 21 January 1999 which results in this Award.\n\n*3. Decision on Documents Submitted by Tradex with Letter of 4 December 1998*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nProcedural Orders preceding the Final Hearing had expressly ruled that no new documents could be submitted by the Parties at the Hearing. At the Hearing, in his introduction, the President of the Tribunal had recalled this, and at the end of the Hearing, without any objection from the Parties, the Tribunal had ruled expressly, as reflected in the Transcript, that, also with the Post-Hearing Memoranda, \"no new documents and no new evidence can be submitted\".\n\n46.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal decides that the documents submitted with Tradex' letter of 4 December 1998 are not admissible. But in order to indicate that this procedural decision is without relevance for the outcome of the case on the merits, the Tribunal subsidiarily adds that, in any case, these documents would not have changed its reasoning or decision on the merits.\n\n*4. Declaration of Closure of Proceeding (Rule 38)*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 38 requires that, when the presentation of the case by the Parties is completed, the proceeding shall be declared closed.\n\n48.\n\nAfter reviewing the presentations by the Parties up to and including the Post-Hearing-Memoranda, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that there is no request by a Party nor any reason to reopen the proceeding, as is possible under paragraph (2) of Rule 38.\n\n49.\n\nTherefore, by Order dated 2 March1999, the proceeding was declared closed according to paragraph (1) of Rule 38.\n\n**C. Relief Sought**\n--------------------\n\n50.\n\nBased on its Request of Arbitration of 17 October 1994 and as updated by its final submission, its Post-Hearing Memorandum of 4 December 1998, Tradex requests that Albania be obliged and condemned to pay:\n\nU.S. $\n\n\"a. Fair Market value as of 01.01.1993 per our Request for Arbitration: 2,200,000\n\nLess:\n\nMachinery & equipment returned on Liquidation of the J.V. (attachment 20 of Request): (352,187)\n\nNet Fair Market Value of TRADEX share to T.& T.J.V. **1,847,813**\n\nb. Interest as per para 23 hereabove: 824,013\n\nc. Arbitration fees: 107,000\n\nd. Legal, Valuation and other consulting fees and services: 246,255\n\ne. Travel, typing, printing, translations and other expenses: 81,993\n\n**Total 3,107,074**\"\n\n51.\n\nAfter Albania had first raised objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, on which the Tribunal decided by its Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996, in its final submission, its Post-Hearing Memorandum of 8 December 1998, Albania requests the Tribunal to adjudge and declare:\n\n\"\u2013 that Tradex has shown no *prima facie* act of expropriation attributable to the Albania, and that accordingly Albania has not under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Law No. 7764 of 2 November 1993 expressed its consent for the matters raised by Tradex in its Request for arbitration dated 17th October 1994 to be subject to ICSID jurisdiction, and that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim;\n\n\u2013 further or alternatively, that no act of expropriation has occurred or is attributable to Albania within the meaning of Article 4 of Law No. 7764 of 2 November 1993;\n\n\u2013 that the Request by Tradex be dismissed; and\n\n\u2013 that Tradex and its shareholders be required to pay Albania's costs in this matter and the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal.\"\n\n**D. Summary of Facts and Contentions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nHereafter, the Tribunal will give a short summary of major facts and contentions in this case insofar as it is considered appropriate in the context of the decision given in this Award. Regarding further details, reference is made to the many and voluminous written briefs and documents submitted by the Parties as well as to the oral presentations by the Parties and witnesses, as recorded in the transcript of the final Hearing and the documents submitted with these oral presentations. Further details will be taken up in the later Section \"Reasons for the Decision\" in this Award.\n\n53.\n\nTradex entered into negotiations in 1991 with Albania in order to undertake an engineering, industrial, and agricultural investment in Albania. Negotiations were completed and Albania appointed a state-owned company, \"T.B. Torovitsa\", to enter into a joint venture with Tradex for realizing the investment on the basis of a proportional participation of 67 to 33. The land would be contributed by T.B. Torovitsa for the use of the joint venture.\n\n54.\n\nOn 10 January 1992, Tradex and T.B. Torovitsa signed an agreement (\"the Agreement\") which established a joint venture between them. T.B. Torovitsa was the owner of 1170 ha farmland in T.B. Torovitsa, Lezha, Albania, and the object of the joint venture was the commercial and agricultural use of this land connected with \"the development of the agricultural engineering, the cultivation of agricultural plants/crops, fruits and vegetables in the fields, development of stock raising/animal products, and the necessary activities pertaining to the processing of milk, meat, and any activities relative to the land and to products yielded by it for the domestic market or exportation\" (Art. 2 of the Agreement). The investment was planned for a duration of 10 years, renewable by common agreement for another period of 10 years.\n\n55.\n\nOn 21 January 1992, the Agreement was approved by an act of the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Economic Affairs called Authorization No. 26. The registrations of the joint venture with competent courts and administrative authorities were completed by 7 March 1992.\n\n56.\n\nUpon the authorization and the completion of formalities concerning the establishment of the joint venture, Tradex commenced the investment according to schedules contained in the Agreement in order to use the farm during the first crop raising period in spring and summer 1992. The investment included various payments totalling US $ 786,343. T.B. Torovitsa contributed further payments and the capital thus established was used to finance the cattle production, the field cultivation, and the payment of 700 personnel.\n\n57.\n\nTradex claims that, in particular, the following measures made the development of the joint venture impossible and left the participation and investment in the joint venture valueless, so that these acts must be considered as acts of expropriation:\n\na) On 22 August 1992, a most significant part of the farm was formally expropriated and transferred to villagers by Albania, namely 140 ha amounting to 15 % of the total farm and its most fertile area.\n\nb) Crop production, cattle, and seed supplies were stolen by the villagers at an almost steady rate of 15 % between March and October 1992 and work of the management of the joint venture was often impossible because of threats and acts of violence.\n\nc) Beginning December 1992, the entry of Tradex' personnel to the farm was made completely impossible because of the seizure and occupation of the farm by villagers.\n\nd) By letters in late 1992 and early 1993, Tradex requested in vain the intervention by Albania as a last effort to save the investment, but Tradex was obliged to hand over the 140 ha mentioned together with cultivations, cattle, and supplies.\n\n58.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Tradex and T.B. Torovitsa found it necessary to dissolve the joint venture; the dissolution was agreed on 21 April 1993 \"as of 30.4.1993\". The Minutes of the Liquidators' Meeting on 2 March 1994 resolved \"that the liquidation was completed on 16.12.1993.\"\n\n59.\n\nFurther details and the various incidents that, according to Tradex, must be considered to be expropriations either each by itself or at least in their combination, will be taken up in the subsequent Section \"Reasons for the Decision\" in this Award.\n\n60.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration of 17 October 1994, Tradex evaluated the market value of its investment according to recognized valuation methods and experience to US $ 2,2 Mill., less US $ 176,093 which represented the value of the machinery and equipment returned to Tradex as their share of the liquidation process. Thus, it estimated the net market value of its loss at US $ 2,023,907 while it estimated its \"real damages\" to be much higher. On that basis, Tradex requested first that Albania be obliged and condemned to pay:\n\na) the market value of Tradex's expropriated investment amounting to US $ 2,023,907;\n\nb) interest on that amount mentioned at current banking interest rate, from December 1, 1992, until payment, and\n\nc) fees and legal expenses of Tradex, to be calculated later.\n\n61.\n\nIn its final submission, the Post-Hearing-Memorandum of 4 December 1998, Tradex updated the calculation of its claim, introducing new figures regarding the machinery and equipment returned on liquidation of the joint venture and regarding interest. Thus, Tradex now formulates its claim as identified in Section C. (Relief sought) above of this Award.\n\n62.\n\nAlbania, in a first stage of the proceeding, objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal invoking particularly five arguments which were considered by the Tribunal in the separate procedure and its Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996 mentioned in Section B. of this Award. As mentioned there, the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction in this case subject to the reservation that the issue as to whether or not an \"expropriation\" had been shown as required by the 1993 Law was joined to the merits.\n\n63.\n\nNow, regarding this issue of jurisdiction joined to the merits and regarding the merits themselves, Albania requests the Tribunal to adjudge and declare as identified above in Section C. (Relief Sought) of this Award.\n\n64.\n\nAlbania submits that the facts as presented by Tradex do not support Tradex's claim and are, by themselves, sufficient to support its own request as cited above. Furthermore, regarding the factual background, Albania, in particular, points out the following additional aspects: Under Albanian law, T.B. Torovitsa is a separate legal entity with full capacity to sue and be sued. The capital provided by Tradex comprised machinery, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation investments while the capital provided by T.B. Torovitsa comprised buildings, machinery, life stock, and finished products as well as other assets. None of the joint venture's capital comprised land. The 1992 Agreement noted that T.B. Torovitsa was the owner of 1170 ha of land, that the area of land would not change \"during the term of the agreement\", and that the joint venture \"shall respect the supplementary needs which will be created for the land\" (Art. 15). In particular, Albania refers to Art. 16 of the Agreement which provides that disputes between the Parties shall be resolved by arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce and that Swiss law shall be applicable. Furthermore, Albania points out that the authorization for the joint venture dated 21 January 1992 expressly provided that the joint venture should conform with Albanian legislation concerning land.\n\n65.\n\nAs far as the liquidation of the joint venture is concerned, Albania indicates that the Dissolution Agreement dated 21 April 1993, led to the dissolution completed on 16 December 1993 according to the liquidators' report. At the state of liquidation, the liquidators' report valued the joint venture's net worth at Leke 6,175,599.05 to be distributed in the proportions 67 % to Tradex and 33 % to T.B. Torovitsa in accordance with Art. 5 of the 1992 Agreement. The liquidators' report proposed that Tradex receive a total of Leke 20,842,420 comprising Leke 8,804,675 in fixed assets and Leke 12,037,745 to be paid by T.B. Torovitsa in installments on the basis of the progress in the liquidation and not later than 31 December 1994. A final partners' meeting was held on 2 March 1994 which resolved to approve the balance sheets drawn up by the liquidators and approved the distribution of the net worth of the joint venture in accordance with the liquidators' report. Tradex did not reserve its rights against T.B. Toro-vitsa or Albania at that final meeting.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with further contentions by both Parties later in this Award in the context of its reasons insofar as it considers such contentions relevant.\n\n**E. Legal Scope of Decision on Merits, Applicable Law**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nBefore the Tribunal can enter into evaluating the facts and contentions of the Parties in this case for its decision on the merits, it seems appropriate to identify the legal framework in which the relevance of the factual aspects can and must be considered.\n\n68.\n\nAn important limitation of this framework is that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996, the Tribunal found that it only had jurisdiction on the basis of the Albanian Law No. 7764 of 2 November 1993 on Foreign Investments (the 1993 Law).\n\n69.\n\nTherefore, in its consideration of the merits, the Tribunal is prevented from examining the claim on any other possible legal basis such as any other of the various investment laws issued in Albania, the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Albania and Greece, as well as other sources of international law. Although court and arbitral decisions and legal writings dealing with such other sources may be of relevance in interpreting the 1993 Law, it is this 1993 Law which the Tribunal will examine as to whether Tradex' claim is justified on the merits. This is in conformity with Art. 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention according to which \"the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable\". Accordingly, the Tribunal will make use of sources of international law insofar as that seems appropriate for the interpretation of terms used in the 1993 Law, such as \"expropriation\". In this context, it should be noted that, though the authentic version of the 1993 Law only exists in the Albanian language, both Parties have used the English translation of that Law in these proceedings and it has not been claimed that this translation is not a true reflection of the 1993 Law. Therefore, the Tribunal also bases its considerations on this English translation of the 1993 Law.\n\n70.\n\nA further limitation comes from the 1993 Law itself. Art. 8 paragraph 2 of the Law which the Tribunal accepted as the basis of its jurisdiction provides for submission to ICSID only,\n\n\"if the dispute arises out of or relates to expropriation, compensation for expropriation, or discrimination and also for the transfers in accordance of Article 7,...\".\n\n71.\n\nAs no discrimination and no breach of the obligations under Art. 7 regarding transfers are claimed by Tradex (see latest Memorandum of 4 December 1998), in view of the above mentioned limitation, for the Tribunal's examination on the merits only the following Articles of the 1993 Law must be considered as possible sources of the claim insofar as they may become relevant for an expropriation and a compensation for expropriation:\n\n*Article 2*Entry and Treatment\n\n1. Foreign investment in the Republic of Albania are nto (sic) conditioned from a preliminary authorization. They are permitted and treated on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to Albanian investments, except that ownership of land which will be treated by a special law.\n\n2. In all cases and at all times, foreign investment shall receive fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security.\n\n3. In any case foreign investments shall be treated on a basis no less favorable than that accorded by rules generally accepted by international law.\n\n*Article 4*Expropriation and Nationalization\n\nForeign investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly or subject to any measure of tantamount effect, except for a public purpose determined on law, in a non-discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation and in accordance with due process of law.\n\n*Article 5*Compensation for Expropriation and Nationalization\n\n1. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or become known, whichever is earlier.\n\n2. Compensation shall be paid without delay and include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of the expropriation, be fully transferable and convertible at the market rate of exchange on the date of the expropriation.\n\n3. In cases in which a foreign investor asserts that all or part of its foreign investment has been expropriated or considers the compensation therefor to be unsatisfactory, the foreign investor shall have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative bodies in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of this Act.\n\n72.\n\nThough Article 4 also mentions \"Nationalization\" as a possible basis for a claim, Tradex has not alleged that its investment was nationalized and, therefore, this aspect of a possible claim also does not have to be considered.\n\n**F. Reasons for the Decisions**\n--------------------------------\n\n*1. Burden of Proof*\n--------------------\n\n73.\n\nAs many factual aspects of this Case are disputed between the Parties, the Tribunal at the outset has to establish who has the burden of proof, i.e. who has to show the elements required as conditions for the claim, and\u2014insofar as they are disputed\u2014has to prove them to the satisfaction of the Tribunal.\n\n74.\n\nAs seen above, the conditions for the compensation claimed by Tradex are mentioned in Art. 4 and 5 of the 1993 Law. The wording of these provisions confirms what can be considered as a general principle of international procedure\u2014and probably also of virtually all national civil procedural laws\u2014, namely that it is the claimant who has the burden of proof for the conditions required in the applicable substantive rules of law to establish the claim. In the ICSID Case Arb/87/3, Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Republic of Sri Lanka (published in 6 ICSID Review\u2014 Foreign Investment Law Journal (1991), p. 527 seq.) the Tribunal considered this to be one of the \"established international law rules\" (at p. 549), relying on Bin Cheng, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals, Cambridge 1987, p. 327, and further sources. Relying also on Bin Cheng (p. 329-331, with quotations from further supporting authorities), the Tribunal also considered as an established international law rule that \"A Party having the burden of proof must not only bring evidence in support of his allegations, but must also convince the Tribunal of their truth, lest they be disregarded for want, or insufficiency, of proof\" (at p. 549).\n\n75.\n\nThus, taking these considerations into account, this Tribunal concludes that Tradex has the burden of proof, in the above sense, for the conditions required in the 1993 Law to establish its claim for compensation.\n\n*2. Rules of Evidence*\n----------------------\n\n76.\n\nAfter having established which Party, in principle, has the burden of proof, the Tribunal must now clarify the rules of evidence applicable in this Case in order to establish the procedural framework within which it has to decide whether or not a disputed fact has, indeed, been proved.\n\n77.\n\nPrimarily, the rules on evidence in this Case are established by Rules 33 to 37 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Particularly relevant is Rule 34 (1):\n\n\"The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility and of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.\"\n\n78.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal must deal with some objections raised by a Party to evidence provided by the other Party in this Case:\n\n79.\n\nTradex (T V p. 2) has objected to the evidential value of witness statements submitted by Albania, because none of them are produced as sworn affidavits. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that, according to ICSID Rule 36 (a) it may\n\n\"admit evidence given by a witness or expert in a written deposition.\"\n\n80.\n\nAs this provision does not call for a sworn affidavit, and as in many national jurisdictions non-sworn written witness statements are admissible and customary, the Tribunal is not prevented from giving evidentiary value to non-sworn written witness statements.\n\n81.\n\nRegarding oral testimony, the Tribunal notes that ICSID Rule 35 expressly provides the wording of declarations that witnesses and experts have to make before giving their evidence. Each of the witnesses and experts heard in the Oral Hearing in this Case was asked by the President of the Tribunal to make, and then, indeed, made such a declaration. In view of the express declarations provided in Rule 35 without the requirement of an oath, the Tribunal has no hesitation to accept the evidentiary value of oral testimony given in this Case.\n\n82.\n\nBoth Parties have pleaded further reasons against the value of evidence submitted by the other Party (see: T V p. 2 to 10 and A III p. 3, 4 and 10). Both have claimed that witnesses lacked independence from the Party presenting them. Tradex particularly alleged interference by Albania on Albanian witnesses proposed by Tradex, testimony of Albania's witnesses \"against their own signature\", forgery of documents, \"the loan\", the \"Ujka-letters\", and other reasons against the credibility of witnesses presented by Albania. Albania particularly objected, because Tradex did not bring certain witnesses and an expert to the Hearing for cross-examination, Tradex did not cross-examine Albania's witnesses Ujka and Ndoci, and that certain testimony of witnesses presented by Tradex contained contradictions to their own earlier testimony and to the testimony of other witnesses.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that none of these objections makes the respective evidence inadmissible. But, in making use of its authority under ICSID Rule 34 (1) to \"be the judge... of its probative value\", the Tribunal, in evaluating the respective evidence, shall take into account the objections raised by the Parties insofar as the Tribunal considers that the evidence objected to is relevant for the award on the merits. On the other hand, the Tribunal sees no need to deal with and decide on objections regarding evidence which, in the Tribunal's judgment, is not relevant for it in deciding on the claim before it.\n\n84.\n\nIn evaluating the evidence before it under Rule 34(1), the Tribunal is aware of certain principles accepted in earlier international cases which have some relevance here. While it does not seem necessary to go into much detail in this regard in this section of the Award, at least the following principles cited, with supporting sources, in the Final Award of ICSID Case Arb/87/3 (op. cit. at pages 549 and 550) may be mentioned:\n\n\"...Rule (J)\u2014The international responsibility of the State is not to be presumed. The party alleging a violation of international law giving rise to international responsibility has the burden of proving the assertion.\n\nRule (K)\u2014International tribunals are not bound to adhere to strict judicial rules of evidence. As a general principle the probative force of the evidence presented is for the tribunal to determine...\n\nRule (L)\u2014In exercising the free evaluation of evidence provided for under the previous Rule, the international tribunals decided the case on the strength of the evidence produced by both parties, and in a case a party adduces some evidence which prima facie supports his allegation, the burden of proof shifts to his opponent.\"\n\n*3. Major Disputed Conditions for the Claim*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nAfter the Tribunal has thus identified its procedural approach regarding the burden of proof and rules on evidence, it now will shortly identify which are the elements of the claim that have to be shown by Tradex\u2014and proved if disputed\u2014as conditions necessary for the claim to be successful on the merits. After this short identification, each of these conditions will have to be taken up in subsequent sections of this Award for a detailed examination.\n\n*a) \"Foreign Investment\"*\n-------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe first condition for a successful claim by Tradex is that there must be a \"foreign investment\".\n\n87.\n\nThis is already required as a condition for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal according to Art. 8 of the 1993 Law which mentions \"foreign investment\" at the beginning of both its paragraphs 1 and 2. In this regard, reference can be made to the Decision on Jurisdiction of this Tribunal dated 24 December 1996. Particularly in section D.3. of that Decision the Tribunal found that Tradex had to be considered as a \"foreign investor\". And on that basis the Tribunal concluded that the conditions for its jurisdiction under the 1993 Law were fulfilled, leaving open, however, the question whether or not an \"expropriation\" has been shown as required by the 1993 Law, which issue was joined to the merits of the Case. As an expropriation can only be established, if a \"foreign investment\" has been made as the possible object of such an expropriation, the Tribunal now, in its consideration of the merits, has to examine whether Tradex has shown that, indeed, it made a \"foreign investment\". The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, therefore, does not prejudge its examination of a \"foreign investment\" in its consideration of the merits of the Case.\n\n88.\n\nRegarding the merits, Art. 2 (1) as well as Art. 4 of the 1993 Law start their wordings with the term \"Foreign investment\" and thereby clearly indicate that their applicability, as a first condition, depends on such a foreign investment having been made. Furthermore, Art. 5 (1) of the 1993 Law, in establishing further standards for compensation, also refers to the \"investment\".\n\n89.\n\nTherefore, there can be no doubt that the first condition for Tradex' claim to be successful is that a \"foreign investment\" has been made.\n\n90.\n\nAs Albania has disputed both the existence and the value of such an investment (see T V p. 5 and Tr 214, 228, 233 seq.), Tradex has to meet the burden of proof in this regard. The Tribunal, therefore, in Section 4 of this Award, will have to examine whether it has fulfilled, to the Tribunal's satisfaction, that burden of proof.\n\n*b) Expropriation*\n------------------\n\n91.\n\nBoth Art. 4 and Art. 5 (1) of the 1993 Law expressly use the term \"expropriated\" and thereby make it clear that a further condition for the claim to be successful is that there is an expropriation. Again, as Albania disputes that any expropriation took place, Tradex has the burden of proof in this regard.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, according to Art. 8 (2) \"expropriation\" is already a condition for the Tribunal's jurisdiction and that the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996 expressly left that condition undecided and joined to the merits the \"issue as to whether or not an \"expropriation\" has been shown as required by the 1993 Law\".\n\n93.\n\nTherefore, in the subsequent Section 5 of this Award the Tribunal will have to examine that issue in detail. In doing so, the Tribunal will have to take into account that Art. 4 expressly provides that three kinds of measures may qualify, namely direct expropriation, indirect expropriation, and thirdly \"any measures of tantamount effect\".\n\n*c) Illegality or Wrongfulness*\n-------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that, indeed, an expropriation has occurred, the question arises\u2014and the Parties have discussed to some extent (see T II p. 4; T III p. 2, 22; Albania in Tr p. 229)\u2014whether \"illegality\" or \"wrongfulness\" of that expropriation is a further condition for the claim to be successful.\n\n95.\n\nThe wording of Art. 4 of the 1993 Law clearly indicates that an expropriation is illegal, if:\n\n\u2022 it is not \"for a public purpose determined on law\",  \n\u2022 or it is effected in a discriminatory manner,  \n\u2022 or it is not in accordance with due process of law.\n\n96.\n\nBut neither of these conditions is alleged by Tradex. Rather, Tradex alleges that it did not receive compensation for its expropriated assets, thereby relying on a fourth condition mentioned in Art. 4:\n\n\u2022 \"upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation\".\n\n97.\n\nFurther requirements for the compensation are provided for in Art. 5 of the 1993 Law.\n\n98.\n\nThough it is beyond doubt that in case of expropriation a compensation has to be paid, it seems less clear both in the discussion by the Parties and in legal writings on the subject what is the legal significance of this requirement. Is an expropriation illegal if no compensation is paid? Or is compensation always due, even if the expropriation is legal? The Tribunal feels it does not have to resolve these questions, however, because in any case it is clear from the 1993 Law that, if an expropriation occurred, compensation has to be paid to Tradex fulfilling the criteria for such compensation mentioned in Art. 4 and Art. 5 (1).\n\n99.\n\nThe issue of illegality might become relevant in another context in this Case: The authorization of the Joint Venture by Decree No. 26 dated 21 January 1992 (T 2) contains, in its Section 5, a reference to the Albanian \"legislation concerning land\" and a \"necessary addendum\" thereto. On that basis it could be argued that a privatization of land in conformity with this legislation must be considered legal, even without compensation, thereby granting an exception to the duty of compensation in the 1993 Law. The Tribunal will deal with this issue when, in the subsequent Section 4 of this Award, it considers the legal scope of Tradex' investment.\n\n*d) Compensation*\n-----------------\n\n100.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that, indeed, all or part of Tradex' investment has been expropriated, it would then have to examine in detail the quantum of the compensation due, applying the criteria for compensation mentioned in Art. 4 and Art. 5 of the 1993 Law. In that context, the Tribunal would have to take into account that Tradex received some assets back after the agreed dissolution of the Joint Venture so that only compensation is due insofar as its value goes beyond the value of such assets.\n\n*4. Foreign Investment by Tradex*\n---------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine in detail the first condition found to be necessary for a successful claim, namely whether and, if so, for what value a \"foreign investment\" by Tradex in Albania has been shown and proved.\n\n102.\n\nAs mentioned above in Section 3. a) of this Award, this condition is required by Art. 8 of the 1993 Law for jurisdiction and by Art. 2, 4 and 5 for the merits in this Case.\n\n*a) Investment by Tradex*\n-------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAs Tradex is the (only) Claimant in this Case, only an investment by Tradex itself is relevant. It is undisputed between the Parties that the Joint Venture \"Tradex Torovice\" formed by the Agreement of 10 January 1992 (T 1) is a separate legal entity under Albanian law (see Art. 1 paragraph 2 of the Agreement and Section 2 of the Authorization of 21 January 1992 = T 2). Therefore, while a Tradex contribution is an investment covered by the 1993 Law, any investment by the Joint Venture itself is not a \"foreign investment\".\n\n104.\n\nFurthermore, for the same reasons, the Joint Venture is not identical with the Albanian State and, therefore, any measures taken by the Joint Venture itself *per se* are not attributable to the Republic of Albania and thus cannot qualify as an expropriation. In any case, if and insofar as Tradex claims that measures taken solely by the Joint Venture or by its partner in the Joint Venture, T.B. Torovitsa are illegal and have caused damage to Tradex on one hand, procedurally, such a dispute would not fall under the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, because Art. 16 of the Joint Venture Agreement provides that disputes between the parties involved in the Joint Venture \"will be resolved by arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris according to its regulations\".\n\n*b) Broad Interpretation of \"Foreign Investment\"*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nBefore examining in detail whether and to what extent Tradex has proved an investment, the Tribunal notes that Art. 1 (3) of the 1993 Law provides a very broad definition of what is to be considered a \"foreign investment\":\n\n\"3. \"Foreign investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania owned directly or indirectly by a foreign investor, consisting of\n\na) moveable and immoveable, tangible and intangible property and any other property rights;\n\nb) a company, shares in stock of a company and any form of participation in a company;\n\nc) loans, claim to money or claim to performance having economic value;\n\nd) intellectual property, including literary and artistic works, sound recordings, inventions, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, know how, trademarks, service marks and trade names; and\n\ne) any right conferred by law or contract, and any license or permit pursuant to law.\"\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this as a confirmation of the broad interpretation given in international law to \"property\" or \"investment\" as the possible object of an expropriation. (See most recently e.g. the Decisions of the ICSID Tribunal in the Case Fedax v. Venezuela: Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 July 1997, ILM XXXVII, 1998, p. 1378 seq. at sections 31 to 43; Award of 9 March 1998, ILM XXXVII, 1998, p. 1391 seq. at section 29).\n\n107.\n\nIn its examination of a possible foreign investment by Tradex in Albania, the Tribunal will, therefore, take into account the broad interpretation provided by the applicable law in this context.\n\n*c) Relevance of Financial Sources of Such Foreign Investment*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThere is a dispute between the Parties in this Case both regarding the factual basis and the legal relevance of the financial sources of Tradex' alleged foreign investment in Albania (see: A II 2; A III 16; T V 10). In particular, Albania alleges that whatever Tradex invested in Albania was financed either by an \"offshore company of unspecified identity and nationality, or by Greek state banks and the European Community\". Tradex claims that the financial sources of its investment are irrelevant in the context of its expropriation claim.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Tradex on this point. The 1993 Law, in its definition of \"Foreign investment\" in Art. 1 (3), nowhere requires that the foreign investor has to finance the investment from his own resources. As seen above, quite to the contrary, the law provides for a broad interpretation of \"investment\". In the present context it may be particularly noted that Art. 1 (3) expressly includes \"every kind of investment...owned directly or indirectly by a foreign investor\", \"loans, claim to money or claim to performance having economic value\" and \"any right conferred by law or contract...\".\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996, in Section D.3. the Tribunal pointed out that the detailed wording in Art. 1 \"Definitions\" of the 1993 Law \"does not give room for further conditions\" and concluded that Tradex qualifies as a \"foreign investor\" under the 1993 Law.\n\n111.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes here that the sources from which the investor financed the foreign investment in Albania are not relevant for the application of the 1993 Law as long as an investment is proved, which the Tribunal will examine hereafter.\n\n*d) Factual Considerations\u2014Investment*\n--------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nAs Albania disputes that any investment was made by Tradex, taking into account the considerations in Section F. 1., F. 2., F. 3. a) and F. 4. b) above of this Award, the Tribunal now has to examine how far Tradex fulfilled its burden of proof regarding the investment.\n\n113.\n\nRegarding Tradex' **investment in kind**, by supply of equipment, the Document No. 31843, signed by the members of the Board of Directors of the Joint Venture Company and dated 30 December 1992 (= T 7) provides a\n\n\"Register\n\nRegarding the itemized account and registration of the capital transferred from \"Tradex Hellas\" to the Agricultural Company Torovice till 30.12.1992.\"\n\n114.\n\nIt lists every piece of equipment together with a value in US Dollars and leads to a total value of US $ 432,803.-, a value which is confirmed on the signed cover sheet of the document.\n\n115.\n\nAlbania has not submitted any concrete challenge of this document and, therefore, the Tribunal concludes that an investment by Tradex in Albania in that amount has been proved.\n\n116.\n\nOn the other hand, Tradex itself has admitted that equipment valued at US $ 352,187.- was returned to Tradex in connection with the dissolution of the Joint Venture and, therefore, has to be deducted from the value of the original investment (T V 28). The \"Liquidators Report\" of 2 March 1994 attached to the \"Minutes of Liquidators Meeting\" of the same day (= T 20) provides a \"List A\" of the equipment returned to Tradex and evaluates it in total as Leke 20,842,420.-. Neither of these documents is challenged by Albania. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that, indeed, a value of US $352,187.- has to be deducted from Tradex' original investment in kind.\n\n117.\n\nRegarding Tradex' **investment in payments**, however, many aspects are disputed between the Parties (see: T I 2; T V 6-8; A I 6-8; A II 5-11; A III 2 and 5; A in Tr 214 seq.).\n\n118.\n\nIn its summary of the investments it claims to have made (particularly in T III p. 7 seq.), Tradex mentions a number of investments not in Albania, but in other countries allegedly in favour of the Joint Venture. In this context, the Tribunal notes that, according to Art. 1 (3) of the 1993 Law, only those investments qualify to be covered by that Law that are made \"in the territory of the Republic of Albania\". In principle, therefore, investments made by Tradex outside Albania do not qualify. This is particularly the case for the various investments for expenses Tradex evaluates as amounting to US $ 160,000.- (see: T III 9) which, as Tradex concedes, were not debited to the Joint Venture.\n\n119.\n\nOn the other hand, investments in fact debited to the Joint Venture and recognized in the Liquidator's Report (T 20) could qualify as \"in the territory of the Republic of Albania\", because \"loans, claim to money\" are expressly mentioned as possible \"foreign investment\" in Art. 1 (3) paragraph c) of the 1993 Law. Tradex evaluates such investments debited and accepted in the Liquidator's Report as amounting to US $ 175,840.- and, for proof, refers to \"items 3 b and 3 c in the Liquidator's Report\" (T III p. 9). Albania has not directly contested that figure, but has claimed in general, based on the testimony of Mr. Hadjigeorgiou, that \"Tradex made no financial contribution whatsoever\" to the investment of the Joint Venture (A III 2 and also A II 10). That, in the opinion of this Tribunal, is sufficient to keep the burden of proof on Tradex.\n\n120.\n\nThe Joint Venture Agreement (T 1), in Art. 4 mentions certain contributions to be made by Tradex to the basic capital of the Joint Venture evaluated as a total of Leke 16,039,000.-, but none of these contributions is identified as an actual payment by Tradex.\n\n121.\n\nThe Articles of Association of the Joint Venture (T 3), in Art. 9, provide that the \"contracting parties deposit a capital in the order of 957,575 USA dollars distributed according to the provisions of the contract\", but are not proof that any payments were actually made by Tradex in addition to its uncontested investment in kind discussed above.\n\n122.\n\nThe governmental Authorization of the Joint Venture (T 2) in its section 3, expressly mentions the same amount of US $ 957,575.- as the initial capital and also as Tradex' share: \"Greek part 641,575 USD $\". But that provision goes on to say that \"the contributions of each part will be deposited and/or will be at disposal till 31/03/1992\". As the Authorization itself is dated 21 January 1992, it is clear that it does not indicate actual payment by Tradex, but only an obligation to contribute by 31 March 1992 leaving it open whether the contribution will be by payment or in kind.\n\n123.\n\nNeither documents nor witness testimony has provided proof that actual payments were made by Tradex to the Joint Venture though, if actually money was transferred or paid in cash, such proof should be available.\n\n124.\n\nOn the basis of all the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that on one hand an investment in kind in a value of US $ 432,803.- has been proved, from which US $ 352,187.- has to be deducted as the value of the equipment returned to Tradex. Thus an investment in the value of US $ 80,616.- remains which could be an investment by Tradex as the object of an expropriation without compensation.\n\n125.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal concludes that Tradex has not fulfilled its burden of proof regarding any other foreign investment in Albania, particularly by way of payment.\n\n*e) Legal Considerations\u2014Investment*\n------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nOnce after the factual basis of the investment has been established, now the legal scope of Tradex' investment in Albania has to be established because the investment can only be the object of an expropriation\u2014and a successful claim for compensation\u2014insofar as Tradex has acquired legal rights as they are described in Art. 1 (3) of the 1993 Law under the definition of \"Foreign investment\".\n\n127.\n\nParagraph a) of that provision mentions \"immoveable... property\" and \"any other property rights\". In this context, the Tribunal notes that Tradex does not claim to have acquired property rights on the land used by the Joint Venture. In fact, the Joint Venture being a separate legal entity under Albanian law, even if the Joint Venture had or acquired any property rights, these would not be rights of Tradex. Art. 15 of the Joint Venture Agreement mentions that Tradex' partner in the Joint Venture, the Torovitsa Agricultural Company, owns 1170 ha of land which will be used by the Joint Venture. No transfer of this ownership is recorded or alleged by the Parties and therefore, it is uncontested that neither Tradex nor the Joint Venture owned the land it used for its administrative and agricultural purposes, but that the Joint Venture had the right to use the land. But even that was only a right of the Joint Venture and not of Tradex itself. Thus, though this right to use the land may be considered as \"any right conferred by law or contract\" and thereby qualify as an \"investment\" under Art. 1 (3) e) of the 1993 Law, if that right was expropriated it was not expropriated from Tradex.\n\n128.\n\nOn the other hand, such an expropriation of a right of the Joint Venture could affect the value of Tradex' share in the Joint Venture and such a share clearly is a \"foreign investment\" according to Art. 1 (3) b) (\"a company, shares in stock of a company and any form of participation in a company\"). Therefore, the Tribunal will have to examine whether Albania expropriated the Joint Venture's right to use the land and thereby indirectly expropriated part of Tradex' share in the Joint Venture.\n\n129.\n\nThere is one further qualification for such an examination: The Joint Venture Agreement, in Art. 15 provides with regard to the land that \"Such area will not change during the term of the agreement\", but adds that \"The joint venture shall respect the supplementary needs which will be created for the land\". While it is not quite clear whether thereby a proviso is made for the implementation of future privatization of land by law, a clearer reference is contained in the Authorization of 21 January 1992 of the Joint Venture (T 2). Section 5 of that Authorization provides:\n\n\"The joint venture will be also conformed to the necessary addendum will taken place to the albanian legislation concerning the land.\" (sic the official translation provided to the Tribunal.)\n\n130.\n\nThe Parties have presented diverging views regarding the relevance of the Land Law (T III 2; T V 17; A I 5, 6, 8; A III 5 seq.; A in Tr 217, 221-223, 227, 228). In particular, Albania argues (Tr 221, 227; A I 8) that the Land Law 7501 of 1991 was well-known in the public and that the above references in the Joint Venture Agreement and particularly in the Authorization made it quite clear to Tradex that privatizations might take place on the basis of the Land Law. Tradex (T III 2), on the other hand, argued that it is irrelevant whether the expropriation is lawful according to local law. Indeed, as mentioned above (Section 3. c)), it can be argued that even a legal expropriation requires compensation according to Art. 4 of the 1993 Law, and this would have been the conclusion if no references to the Land Law were made in the Joint Venture Agreement and the Authorization. However, it must be assumed that these references were meant to have some legal significance and, therefore, they cannot be interpreted as leading necessarily to the same result as would be reached without such references. The legal significance could only be that the parties to the Agreement, including Tradex, accepted future applications of the Land Law and that the investment was subject to future applications of the Land Law, in other words: subject to future privatizations. If this was a legal limitation on Tradex' investment from the very beginning, then it could be argued that the actual application of the Land Law at a later stage did not infringe the investment and thus did not constitute an expropriation.\n\n131.\n\nIn view of these considerations, should the Tribunal find, in the subsequent Section of this Award on \"Expropriation\", that an expropriation of Tradex' rights has in fact been made by the Albanian State, it would have to examine whether such rights were indeed acquired by Tradex or were covered by the reference to the Land Law and thus from the very beginning of the investment subject to possible privatization measures.\n\n*5. Expropriation*\n------------------\n\n*a) Preliminary Observations*\n-----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nFirst it should be recalled that the question whether there was an expropriation of Tradex' investment by Albania, is already relevant for the jurisdiction of this Tribunal according to Art. 8 (2) of the 1993 Law and that the Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996, did not come to a conclusion in this regard but rather joined that question to the consideration of the merits of the Case.\n\n133.\n\nAccording to Art. 4 of the 1993 Law, foreign investment shall not be expropriated\n\n1) directly  \n2) indirectly  \n3) or by any measure of tantamount effect.\n\n134.\n\nThereby, the Law covers a wide range of takings and makes it clear that not only government measures expressly denominated as \"expropriations\" or directly taking away all or part of the investment are prohibited, but also other measures that indirectly or by their effect lead to the foreign investor losing acquired rights of the kind mentioned under the definition of \"foreign investment\" in Art. 1 (3) of the 1993 Law. The Parties have extensively argued whether an expropriation has occurred in this Case (in particular see: T II 5; T III 15-27; A I 3, 22 seq., 25; A II 4; A III 3, 10; Tr 215-219, 222 seq., 226 seq.). In its examination of the facts of the Case, the Tribunal will, therefore, deal with every incident alleged by Tradex as having the effect of a taking.\n\n135.\n\nAn as similarly broad interpretation as in Art. 4 is given to \"expropriation\" in international law (e.g. see: In the Amoca Case: \"a compulsory transfer of property rights\", Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 15 (1997), p. 220; in the Otis Case: \"necessary...to prove, firstly that its property rights had been interfered with to such an extent that its use of those rights or the enjoyment of their benefits was substantially affected and that it suffered a loss as a result...\", Iran-US Claims Tribunal, 84 I.L.R. section 28), in evaluating particular incidents, the Tribunal may also get guidance from sources of international law in its interpretation of Art. 4 of the 1993 Law.\n\n136.\n\nTherefore, though a broad range of takings may be considered in this context, there is always a second condition for such a taking to qualify as an expropriation: the attributability to the State. This is not mentioned directly, but also established in international law (e.g. see: Otis Case, as above, sections 28, 29 and 47; Protiva Case, Yearbook Commercial Arbitration 21 (1996) section 53). It is uncontested between the Parties that attributability to the State is, in principle, a condition of expropriation, but they disagree as to whether certain incidents of interference, in fact, can be attributed to the Albanian State.\n\n137.\n\nThus, the Tribunal now has to examine each of the incidents alleged by Tradex as expropriations with regard to two questions:\n\n1) Is there a taking of rights acquired by Tradex as part of its investment?\n\n2) If so, is that taking attributable to the Republic of Albania?\n\n*b) Privatization Process prior to August 1992*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe privatization process in Albania started by Law No. 7501 of 19 July 1991 (A I Exh. 7) which provided for the distribution of the land of the state farming cooperatives. This 1991 Land Law provided for (Art. 7) and Decision No. 230 of the Council of Ministers of 27 July 1991 (A III Exh. 14) implemented the establishment of land commissions at the national, district and village levels. The criteria to be used by these commissions were authorized by Art. 24 of the 1991 Land Law and specified by Decision 255 of the Council of Ministers dated 2 August 1991 (A II Exh. 18). Regulations on the registration and transfer processes for the land were set out in Decision No. 256 of the Council of Ministers also dated 2 August 1991 (A II Exh. 15).\n\n139.\n\nThis privatization of the state farming cooperatives did not directly effect the land used by the Joint Venture \"Tradeks Torovice\", because that land was owned by Tradex' partner in the Joint Venture \"Torovitsa\" and \"Torovitsa\" was not a state farming cooperative, but was a state farm. The privatization process of the state farming cooperatives outlined above can only be seen as a legal background, which was in place at the time of the establishment of the Joint Venture in early 1992, to the privatization of state farms which was to follow.\n\n140.\n\nTradex alleges (T V 13) that the Democratic Party in Albania entered the elections of April/May 1992 with a policy to also privatize the state farms, and that after the Party had won the elections, it could implement this policy using the legal framework for previous privatizations outlined above.\n\n141.\n\nBut Tradex does not allege\u2014and there is indeed no indication in the files of this Case\u2014that any measures occurred prior to August 1992 which could be considered as expropriations.\n\n*c) Decision No. 364 of 22 August 1992*\n---------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe first measure which Tradex alleges to be an expropriation\u2014or a first step in a longer expropriation process\u2014is the Decision No. 364 of 22 August 1992 of the Council of Ministers (T 11). That Decision first transferred the Mali Kolaj village, until then under the jurisdiction of the Prefecture of Shkoder, to the Prefecture of Lezhe, but then ruled:\n\n\"2. The rural area of 140 ha of Mali Kolaj village remains to the prefecture of Shkoder.\" (sic in the English translation provided to the Tribunal.)\n\n143.\n\nThe Parties have submitted very different interpretations and explanations of that ruling (T V 14 seq.; T in Tr 203 seq.; A I 17, 18, 20; A III 12; A III 6, 10; A in Tr 235 seq.). In particular, Tradex has claimed that this meant \"that 140 ha from Torovitsa land should be distributed to the villagers of Mali Kolaj village\" and \"was the base of all expropriation\" (T V 14). To the contrary, Albania considers the ruling as \"purely administrative decision which has no effect on any property rights\" and also claims that the 140 ha were not land used by the Joint Venture (A I 18; A III 6 seq.).\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal on one hand considers the exchange of written communications between the Executive Committee of the Prefecture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and the Community of Balldren-Lezhe between 20 May and 12 July 1992 (T 8, 9, 10, 11, 17 and 18) as a clear indication that the administrative decision regarding the 140 ha had the intention to enable the distribution of that land to the villagers at a future date. But, on the other hand, the Tribunal sees no indication, in these documents or otherwise in the file, that in fact, by Decision No. 364, either\n\nTorovitsa lost its ownership in any land or the Joint Venture lost the right and the factual possibility to use its land. In fact, the witness statement by Mr. Tusha (A II Exh. 12), to which Tradex particularly referred in this context (Tr 203), on one hand calls this decision \"the basis\" for \"**subsequent** decisions\" **to** \"**begin**\" the distribution of land, but on the other hand expressly mentions that this decision \"does not affect the title on property\" (emphasis added by Tribunal).\n\n145.\n\nTherefore, that Decision cannot be qualified as an expropriation.\n\n*d) Alleged Invasion August/September 1992*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nFrom the beginning of this arbitration Tradex has alleged that villagers occupied the 140 ha (which were the object of the Decision No. 364 mentioned above) in August and September 1992 (T I 3). It is not quite clear to the Tribunal whether this incident is still alleged at the end of the procedure, because, in its Post-Hearing Memorial (T V 15), Tradex does not reference that period of August/September, but, on the other hand, does mention that Decision 364 \"led the villagers of Mali Kolaj to take possession by force\". The Tribunal does not see sufficient evidence that Tradex has fulfilled its burden of proof in this regard, because the testimony of witnesses does not provide a clear picture, there is no contemporaneous evidence of an August/September invasion, it is undisputed that neither Tradex nor the Joint Venture took formal steps complaining about the alleged invasion, and the first document mentioning any kind of invasion are the Minutes of 4 December 1992 (T 75) which, however, only mention an incident of 4 December. Also, Mr. Azas, in his subsequent letters to the Albanian Government, did not mention any invasion in August/September 1992 (T 12\u2013T 18; Tr 42, 43).\n\n147.\n\nIn any case, no evidence has been provided to prove the second condition for an expropriation, namely the attributability to the Government. Tradex alleges \"that the incident of the Mali Kolaj villagers has been provoked by a state act\". But the Tribunal sees no evidence in the text of Decision 364 authorizing such an invasion and no evidence has been provided that other behaviour of the Albanian authorities encouraged villagers to invade the land. Tradex has also not shown that it contacted the authorities after these alleged invasions so that a failure to act by the authorities could be considered under the aspect of attributability to the State.\n\n148.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that no expropriation has been proved in connection with the alleged invasions in August/September 1992.\n\n*e) Decision 452 of 17 October 1992*\n------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nTradex alleges (T V 15-17) that \"the formal expropriation of Torovitsa farm\" took place by Decision 452 dated 17 October 1992 by the Council of Ministers (Text in A II Exh. 16) and that this decision was not depending on an implementation procedure or a formal title, or registration at the Cadaster office, but rather was a self-executing law (T V 16). According to Tradex an additional act was only necessary for the distribution of the expropriated land.\n\n150.\n\nAlbania, on the other hand, claims (A II 18 seq.) that Decision 452 only provided that the order and procedure for the privatization and restructuring of the state farms would be determined by the Central Agency for Restructuring and Privatisation of State Farms which had been created by Decision 300 dated 30 July 1992 of the Council of Ministers. According to Albania (A II 19), neither Decision 452 provided nor was it the intention of the Agency to privatize all agricultural enterprises and it was expressly intended that joint ventures that had been created by that time\u2014October 1992\u2014would not be subject to the privatization or redistribution of land.\n\n151.\n\nIndeed, an examination of the text of Decision 452 shows that it contains no wording indicating an expropriation by that Decision itself, but rather wording authorizing such privatization:\n\n\"1.... be distributed\"\n\n\"2.... to be distributed\"\n\n\"4. Land... will be given...\".\n\n152.\n\nParticularly, section 8 of the Decision provides:\n\n\"8. Central Agency for Restructuring and Privatisation is assigned to determine the agricultural enterprises or their components to be distributed, time and order of distribution and issuing of relevant instructions.\"\n\n153.\n\nFrom this provision it can be seen that not all agricultural enterprises are to be privatized, but that rather the Agency will select them or their components for privatization, as well as the time and order for each such privatization. There is no indication in the text of the Decision that land of the Torovitsa Joint Venture will be selected for such privatization.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, does not consider Decision 452 to be an expropriation of part of Tradex' investment.\n\n*f) Berisha Speech of 27 October 1992*\n--------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nTradex (e.g. T V 15) gives great importance to the speech of Mr. Sali Berisha (text in T 69) of 27 October 1992 which was widely reported in the press and television, as an indication that the government intended to fulfill its pre-election promises and policies.\n\n156.\n\nIndeed, shortly after Decision 452 of 17 October 1992, that speech of 27 October 1992 emphasized to the general public that the government intended to in fact implement its privatization program also regarding agricultural enterprises. But the Berisha speech was neither a legislative or executive act nor did it change the situation found above in Section e) created by Decision 452.\n\n157.\n\nTherefore, the Berisha speech cannot be considered to be an expropriation, by itself or together with Decision 452.\n\n*g) Alleged Occupation October/November 1992*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nTradex further alleges that, upon proclamation of Decision 452, the villagers of the other villages situated around Torovitsa rushed to the Torovitsa farm and occupied it (T V 15). During the Hearing this was confirmed by the direct testimony of Mr. Lapardhaja that from October till December 1992 300 hectares of land were taken by the villagers (Tr 54).\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that this testimony is, to some extent, not confirmed by other testimony of the same witness. First, Mr. Lapardhaja did not mention this occupation in his several and extensive written witness statements provided before the Hearing (T 45, 46, 48, 49, 50). Secondly, in cross-examination during the Hearing, the witness could not identify the allegedly occupied 300 ha of land (Tr 83).\n\n160.\n\nThe testimony of Mr. Azas is also not clear in this regard. On one hand he said that 300 hectares were occupied \"in the autumn of 1992, October, November, December\" (Tr 37). On the other hand, in crossexamination, he said: \"No, no. In October it was too early. We did not believe they will expropriate.\" (Tr 45).\n\n161.\n\nIf, indeed, 300 hectares were taken by the villagers up to the end of 1992, it is also difficult to understand, why Mr. Azas, in his seven letters to the Government between 31 October 1992 and 12 July 1993 (T 12\u2013 18) complaining and asking for help never mentioned these alleged occupations by the villagers. When asked about this in cross-examination, he said that he did not remember why this was not mentioned in his letter of 12 December 1992 which did mention the incident of 4 December 1992 (Tr 42).\n\n162.\n\nMr. Lohja, the witness presented by Albania, denied that 300 hectares were occupied by villagers in November 1992 (Tr 168).\n\n163.\n\nFurthermore, the only contemporaneous document about occupation of land of the Joint Venture, the Minutes of 4 December 1992 (T 75) do not mention the alleged occupations in October and November, but only an occupation on 4 December 1992, though it would have been normal to also mention occupations that allegedly occurred the two months before and therefore were a much more serious deprivation.\n\n164.\n\nTaking into account the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Tradex has not fulfilled its burden of proof regarding these alleged occupations in October and November 1992.\n\n165.\n\nSubsidiarily, even if the villagers felt encouraged to such occupations by Decision 452 and the Berisha speech, that would not be a sufficient basis to attribute such occupations to the State of Albania, and no other evidence has been provided as a basis for such an attributability. (See e.g. the ICSID Decision in the Amco Asia Case in which the Tribunal considered a much more direct and active involvement by the state in a private taking by army and police still not as sufficient for an attribution to the state; ICSID Reports 1, p. 377, at 455.)\n\n*h) Alleged Occupation and Destruction of Crops by Animals on 4 December 1992*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe only alleged occupation confirmed by a contemporaneous document is the one of 4 December 1992. The Minutes of Meeting of that day (T 75) have the following wording:\n\n\"We report that today the 4th December 1992 we caught the animals of the village Mali-Kolaj in the sown field with clover, cotton and maize. The parcels No. 1, 2, 3 shown with clover and parcel 13 with cotton and maize.\n\n1. The parcel No. 3 distroyed completely.\n\n2. The parcel No. 13, 4 ha cotton and 9 ha maize destroyed completely.\n\nwith the explanation that \"today the land is ours because it was given to us by the Prefecture and the Commune of Ball-dren\".\n\nWe prepared these minutes to demand idemnity.\n\nThe Supervisor   \nPal Luli\n\nThe agronomist  \nGjok Prela\"\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal interprets this document, though it expressly only mentions \"animals\", to the effect that villagers either came on the land with their animals or at least let the animals on the land and then gave the cited explanation \"today the land is ours because it was given to us by the Prefecture and the Commune of Balldren\".\n\n168.\n\nTradex (T V 18) claims that these Minutes refer to damage done by the alleged invasions either in \"August/September\" or in \"November/ December\" 1992. The Minutes clearly say that \"today\", i.e. on 4 December 1992 the animals were caught. Even if the Minutes\u2014and the uncontested English translation\u2014are made in unprecise language, the meaning of \"today\" is clear and it is highly unprobable that minutes expressly \"pre-pared...to demand idemnity\" (last phrase of the Minutes) would have chosen \"today\", if they intended to refer to an occupation that started much earlier in November.\n\n169.\n\nBut, as these Minutes are a contemporaneous document, the Tribunal is inclined to accept these Minutes as proof for the occupation on 4 December. But even if it also accepted that, indeed, the villagers said what is cited in the Minutes, attribution to the Albanian State would still have to be shown and proved. The cited explanation of the villagers may show what they believed, perhaps on the basis of Decision 452 and the Berisha speech, but it does not show that, in fact the Albanian State authorized the occupation. As seen above, neither Decision 452 nor the Berisha speech actually transfer property in or the right to use the land to the villagers. And Tradex has neither provided any evidence that any state authorities permitted the occupation, nor at least, that after being called by the Joint Venture or Tradex for protection, refused to grant protection.\n\n170.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that, in any case, the incident of 4 December 1992 cannot be considered as an expropriation due to lack of attributability to the Republic of Albania.\n\n*i) Alleged Occupation by Villagers in December 1992*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe testimony of Mr. Lapardhaja during the Hearing indicates that a new situation arose in December 1992, because, while the villagers allegedly had occupied land before on their own, from December \"the villagers began working together with the chairmen of the communes and the Titles Office\" (Tr 54).\n\n172.\n\nTradex claims (T V 17) that their occupations are confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Azas. But Mr. Azas stated that his last visit to Torovitsa was on 4 December 1992 (Tr 20) and that, thereafter, he stayed in Tirana. Thus it is difficult to see how he can confirm occupations after the one on 4 December which has been dealt with above in Section h).\n\n173.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Lohja, in his testimony (Tr 167, 168) has confirmed one incident in December which seems to be the one on 4 December because he also mentions animals entering the fields, but Mr. Lohja goes on to say that the animals were removed and that no such incident occurred again (Tr 168).\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the letters which allegedly Mr. Azas wrote in and right after December 1992, namely the letters dated 12 December, 21 December and 21 January 1992 (T 12, T 14, T 15), though mentioning that \"we cannot go to the farm, because we encounter many obstacles from several persons\" (letter 21.12.1992, T 14), none of these letters mentions any occupation by villagers though it could have been expected that such an occupation would be included in the complaints to the Albanian government.\n\n175.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Tradex has not fulfilled its burden of proof that such occupations occurred after 4 December 1992 nor that they were attributable to the Republic of Albania.\n\n*j) Dissolution of the Joint Venture in April 1993*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nTradex further claims that the dissolution of the Joint Venture, though effected by consent between Tradex and its partner in the Joint Venture, was forced upon Tradex and constitutes an expropriation (see e.g. T V 11 seq.).\n\n177.\n\nAs expropriation by definition is a \"compulsory\" transfer of property rights (see e.g. Amoca Case, cited above, section 135), an agreement reached in consent with the foreign investor and signed by it as in the Dissolution Agreement dated 21 April 1992 (T 19) can hardly be seen as an act of expropriation in itself. This is even more so as, again with full consent of Tradex, the Agreement mandated \"all necessary measures\" for the \"liquidation of the joint venture\" and, in conformity therewith, the liquidators appointed by Tradex and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food presented a \"Liquidators Report\" and \"Minutes of Liquidators Meeting\" (T 20) completing the liquidation on 16 December 1993, identifying certain assets valued at Leke 20,842,420.- to be returned to Tradex which then indeed were given back to and accepted by Tradex without objection.\n\n178.\n\nThe Parties have discussed broadly and disagree considerably why the Joint Venture failed and whether Mr. Ujka in fact wrote certain letters (A I Exh. 12 and 13) in this context and what relevance these letters have (see e.g.: T II 13; T V 8, 11, 13 seq.; A I 13; A II 15 seq.).\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal feels it is only relevant in the context of this Award whether, in spite of Tradex' consent to the dissolution and to its implementation, it has been shown\u2014and, in view of Albania's objection proved\u2014that the dissolution was forced upon Tradex.\n\n180.\n\nThe Dissolution Agreement is helpful in this examination insofar as it expressly mentions \"which problems made impossible the continuation of operation of the joint venture, namely:\n\n(1) The complete inexistence of security of the production of the J.V. and of the life of the managerial personnel of the J.V.\n\n(2) The destruction of the irrigation system of the farm by the inhabitants of the region.\n\n(3) The take-over of lands of the farm by inhabitants of the region with permission of the State.\"\n\n181.\n\nWhile the first two reasons obviously cannot be identified as expropriation measures, the third reason, also obviously could be such an expropriation measure.\n\n182.\n\nThe mere fact that this third reason is mentioned in the Dissolution Agreement provides, by itself, not yet proof that such a take-over took place and that there was a permission of the State. This is particularly so as not the representatives of the Republic of Albania, but \"only\" the representatives of the two partners in the Joint Venture, i.e. Tradex and Torovitsa N.B., signed the Agreement. Tradex has argued in this context (T V 3) that Mr. Ujka was a civil servant in the Cadaster Office of Lezhe and was the representative of the Albanian State in the Torovitsa N.B. and the respective state farm. But Mr. Ujka's position as a civil servant does not by itself indicate that when he signed under the words \"For Torovitsa N.B.\" beyond that designated representation his signature also represented the Albanian State. Furthermore, in his oral testimony, Mr. Ujka explained that the take-overs never happened and he only accepted the respective third reason in the text of the Agreement because M. Azas convinced him that such a reference was in his own interest, that Tradex had started negotiations with the Ministry of Agriculture to be given land in another area, and that Mr. Azas could not come to Torovitsa \"because of the pressure on the part of the workers and we cannot continue our operation here in Torovitsa\" (Tr 160). Furthermore, in answer to more specific questions, Mr. Ujka denied that villagers had taken any land in August 1992, that in any way the local police was involved, that in October and November 1992 additional 300 hectares were taken over by villagers until the incident mentioned above occurred on 4 December 1992 (Tr 161).\n\n183.\n\nEven if there is some contradiction between what Mr. Ujka signed in the Dissolution Agreement and his testimony, the Tribunal finds that the mere mentioning of the third reason in the Dissolution Agreement by itself is not sufficient for Tradex to fulfill its burden of proof both for the taking and the permission of the State. This is at least so if, as seen in the above Sections of this Award, none of the incidents alleged by Tradex can be considered as a proven taking attributable to the Albanian State.\n\n*k) Issuance of Titles to Mr. Pellumbi and Others*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nTradex has submitted written witness statements by Mr. Pellumbi (T 44 and T 77), a villager of Torovitsa temporarily staying in Greece. In his statements, Mr. Pellumbi says that he was given a piece of land of 12,000.-square meters in the privatization process about the end of 1992 and, from his memory, he lists some 200 families in the same region to whom, according to him, about the end of 1992 and in the beginning of 1993 the whole farm was distributed by title deeds (T 44 page 2 seq.). None of the title deeds have been produced to the Tribunal except a title deed for Mr. Pellumbi dated much later, namely of 20 September 1993 (A I Exh. 16), and Mr. Pellumbi did not come to the Hearing to present oral testimony. Albania had requested his appearance and objects to the acceptance of his written statements because he was not made available for cross-examination. Tradex has indicated that Mr. Pellumbi did not appear in person because he was afraid to be exposed to undue pressure by Albania.\n\n185.\n\nBe that as it may, the Tribunal finds that in view of the fact that Tradex has the burden of proof, the written statements of a single witness, who then\u2014for whatever reason\u2014is not available at the Hearing for crossexamination by the other Party and for questions by the members of the Tribunal, is not sufficient to prove that in fact land was distributed and title deeds issued in late 1992 and early 1993.\n\n186.\n\nOn the other hand, the only title deed produced to the Tribunal dates from September 1993, a time when the Joint Venture had already been dissolved by the Agreement dated 21 April 1993 and, therefore, by its timing cannot be proof of an expropriation measure.\n\n*l) Decisions and Measures after the Dissolution Agreement of 21 April 1993*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nA number of decisions and measures occurred after 21 April 1993 when the Joint Venture was agreed to be dissolved.\n\n188.\n\nThe first was a decision of 5 May 1993 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (A I Exh. 14) approving the liquidator of the Joint Venture. As the liquidation was mandated in the Dissolution Agreement itself and then performed without objections by Tradex, the approval of the Ministry of a procedure agreed to by Tradex cannot be an expropriation.\n\n189.\n\nThe next measure is the Protocol dated 10 May 1993 of the Division of Privatisation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (A I Exh. 15) \"in application of Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 452 of 17 October 1992\" to dissolve the \"Agricultural enterprise Torovice\" and distribute 920 ha of land to 2,800 workers and citizens of the enterprise each of them receiving 3,200 square meters of land. On that basis, as seems uncontested between the Parties, thereafter a Land Commission distributed the land to the villagers, these were registered in the cadastre and received title deeds such as the one granted to Mr. Pellumbi on 20 September 1993.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have to examine these measures starting with the Protocol of 10 May 1993. They could probably easily qualify as an expropriation if the land had still been used by the Joint Venture. But, as the parties to the Joint Venture, including Tradex, on 21 April 1992 had concluded the Dissolution Agreement, the use of the land had been discontinued and thus the privatization of the land no longer could effect the Joint Venture and Tradex' investment. This conclusion is not changed by the fact that the liquidation of the Joint Venture still took until December 1993, because\u2014as seen above\u2014the ownership in the land did not belong to the Joint Venture and, therefore, was not part of the assets to be liquidated.\n\n*m) Combined Evaluation of the Decisions and Events as Expropriation*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nWhile the above examination in Sections b) to l) of this Award has come to the conclusion that none of the single decisions and events alleged by Tradex to constitute an expropriation can indeed be qualified by the Tribunal as expropriation, it might still be possible that, and the Tribunal, therefore, has to examine and evaluate hereafter whether the combination of the decisions and events can be qualified as expropriation of Tradex' foreign investment in a long, step-by-step process by Albania.\n\n192.\n\nTradex has claimed (Tr 205-207 and T V II seq.) that such a qualification must be made.\n\n193.\n\nIt is uncontested between the Parties that there was a long privatization process in Albania which started with the Land Law No. 7501 of 19 July 1991 (A I Exh. 7). That Law provided for the distribution of the land of state farming cooperatives which was the land that had been in private ownership until 1945. In this context, it should be recalled that Torovitsa N.B., Tradex' partner in the Joint Venture which owned the land to be used by the Joint Venture, was not such a cooperative and thus the Land Law of 1991 did not apply to it. Art. 7 of the Land Law was implemented by Decision No. 230 of the Council of Ministers of 27 July 1991 establishing land commissions at the national, district and village levels (A II Exh. 14). Further criteria were specified by Decision No. 255 of the Council of Ministers dated 2 August 1991 (A II Exh. 18) and regulations on the registration and transfer processes for land set out in Decision No. 256 of the same day (A II Exh. 15).\n\n194.\n\nThis was the legal framework in place at the time when Tradex concluded the Joint Venture Agreement on 10 January 1992 (T 1) with Torovitsa N.B., a state farm to which, it may be repeated, that legal framework was not applicable.\n\n195.\n\nIt seems uncontested between the Parties that before the elections of April/May 1992 the Democratic Party announced that, should it win the elections and form the new government, it would expand the privatization program to the state farms (see e.g. T V 13). After the Democratic Party in fact had won the elections, appropriate steps were taken to implement that promise.\n\n196.\n\nRegarding the land of Torovitsa which is relevant in this arbitration, though Albania stresses the purely administrative character of that decision (e.g. see A I 17, 18; A III 6, 10), the Tribunal accepts Tradex' explanation (e.g. see T V 13, 14) that Decision 364 of 22 August 1992 (T 11) transferring the Mali Kolaj village to the Prefecture of Lezhe, but retaining its rural area of 140 ha in the Prefecture of Skhoder was the preliminary administrative decision on the basis of which the distribution of the 140 ha of land to the villagers took place at a later stage in the process of the privatization of that area. It seems plausible, as Tradex explains (T V 13, 14), that 140 ha which were far away from the village of Mali Kolaj and therefore not well fit to be used by the villagers after privatization, were to be replaced by an area of 140 ha of Torovitsa which was close to the village and therefore well fit to be used by the villagers. No other convincing explanation for this administrative decision to change the jurisdiction has been presented to the Tribunal. However, as seen above in Section 5. c) of this Award, that administrative decision did not deprive the Joint Venture from the use of those 140 ha and therefore cannot be qualified as an expropriation. The conceivable intention of Decision 364 to prepare for a **later** privatization does not change that conclusion.\n\n197.\n\nAs seen above, after that Decision 364, none of the decisions taken or alleged invasions by villagers examined in detail in the above Sections 5. d) to 5. k) can be qualified as an expropriation. The remaining question for the Tribunal is whether these events, in their combination, can nevertheless be qualified as an expropriation. Again, this would require that Tradex fulfills its burden of proof in this regard, namely that it proves a taking and its attributability to the Albanian State.\n\n198.\n\nRegarding the condition that a taking has to be proved, this would require that, compared to the beginning of the relevant period, August 1992, at the end of the period Tradex would have less of an investment. If one accepts, in spite of the dispute between the Parties regarding the success of the Joint Venture up to August 1992, that the Joint Venture had all the land of Torovitsa N.B. available for the use of the Joint Venture, Tradex would have to meet the burden to prove that less was available at the time of the dissolution of the Joint Venture in April 1993. Now, the above examination in Sections c), e), f) has shown that none of the acts of the state authorities deprived Tradex of any of its rights, and the examination in Sections d), g), h) and i) has shown that Tradex could not prove that it lost use of land due to alleged invasions of villagers, and furthermore that such alleged invasions were attributable to the State of Albania.\n\n199.\n\nThe conclusion, therefore, is that at the end of the relevant period there is not sufficient evidence or proof that Tradex had less land available than in August 1992.\n\n200.\n\nThis conclusion is not changed by the undisputed fact that the Joint Venture, in the later part of that period did not actually agriculturally use all of the land and the Joint Venture was in difficulties and that the Parties have very different opinions why this was so (see in particular: The alleged Azas' letters, T 12-18; the alleged Ujka's letters, A I Exh. 12, 13; T II 13; T V 8, 11, 13, 14; A I 13, 20; A II 14-16; A III 9), because what is relevant in the context of this Award is only whether expropriation measures were the cause of these difficulties, which Tradex has not proved. As the International Court of Justice pointed out in the Elsi Case, it must be proved \"that the ultimate result was the consequence of the acts or omissions\" of the state authorities (I.C.J. Reports 1989, section 119). Or, as the Iran-US Claims Tribunal found in the Otis Case, \"a multiplicity of factors affected Claimant's enjoyment of its property rights... However, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Claimant has established that the infringement of these rights was caused by conduct attributable to the Government of Iran. The acts of interference determined by the Tribunal as being attributable to Iran are not sufficient in the circumstances of this Case, either individually or collectively, to warrant a finding that a deprivation or taking of the Claimant's participation in Iran Elevator had occurred.\" (I.L.R. 84, section 47). Taking these standards into account, the Tribunal in this Case finds that Tradex has not proved that the failure of the Joint Venture was due to expropriation measures by the State of Albania.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal finds some confirmation of this conclusion in the undisputed fact that Tradex ordered a feasibility study in January 1993 on expanding the Joint Venture and requesting loans from Greek banks and the European Community. Had Tradex considered that its investment had been expropriated by the Albanian State and the Joint Venture was failing for that reason, it is hard to understand why it then invested further money in such a feasibility study. In fact, during cross-examination, when asked whether he mentioned any acts of expropriation in his applications to the Greek banks and to the European Union, Mr. Azas said:\n\n\"I think no. We did not say we have the problem because, as I told you, we did not believe serious problems at this time.\"\n\n(Tr 45, 46)\n\n202.\n\nIf this was so in January 1993 and as Tradex does not allege any further expropriation measures after January 1993, even Tradex' own behaviour seems to confirm that it had not been deprived of its investment until the Joint Venture was dissolved in April 1993 in agreement with Tradex.\n\n203.\n\nIn view of all these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Tradex has also not fulfilled its burden of proof that a general combined evaluation of the decisions and events starting August 1992 must be qualified as an expropriation.\n\n*n) General Conclusion*\n-----------------------\n\n204.\n\nAt the end of its examination in this Section 5 of the Award, therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Tradex has not been able to prove that an expropriation occurred regarding its foreign investment in the Joint Venture. And the Tribunal further concludes that the evidence presented by Tradex is not sufficient to support its allegation of an expropriation in such a way that the burden of proof would have shifted to Albania either regarding a taking or regarding the attribution of a taking to the Republic of Albania.\n\n205.\n\nIn view of this conclusion, if no expropriation occurred there is no jurisdiction according to Art. 8 of the 1993 Law and no compensation is due to Tradex according to Art. 4 of the 1993 Law. There is, therefore, no need for the Tribunal to enter into an examination of the quantum of such compensation.\n\n*6. Costs of the Proceeding*\n----------------------------\n\n206.\n\nFor its decision regarding the costs of the proceeding, the Tribunal first takes into account that Tradex prevailed in the procedure concluded by the Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996, and that now, Albania prevailed on the merits. Furthermore, though, taking the dispute as a whole, Tradex failed in its claim, it may be taken into account that, by no means, this claim can be considered as frivolous in view of the many difficult aspects of fact and law involved and dealt with in this Award.\n\n207.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that, in view of all the circumstances of this dispute, each Party should bear its own expenses and the costs of its own legal representation, and that the costs of the arbitration, covered by equal advance deposits by both Parties, should be borne by the Parties equally in shares of 50 %.\n\n**G. Decisions**\n----------------\n\n208.\n\nFor the reasons stated in the preceding sections of this Award the Tribunal decides:\n\na) The claim by Tradex is denied.\n\nb) Each Party shall bear its own expenses and the costs of its own legal representation in this Case.\n\nc) The costs of the arbitration, covered by equal advance deposits by both Parties, shall be born by the Parties equally in shares of 50 %."}]}
