In the same letter, Mexico stressed that its agreement did not amount to an acceptance of jurisdiction and admissibility of these cases, and the claimants' claims. Mexico therefore reserved its right to bring objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility in due course.\n\nOn February 21, 2022, the Tribunal informed the parties how it proposed to proceed in order to implement the parties' agreement, and circulated a draft procedural order on the addition of L1bre Holding as a claimant to this proceeding.\n\nOn March 1, 2022, L1bre Holding filed a letter consenting to having its claims heard together in this proceeding, confirming that it had no objections to the constitution of the Tribunal in this proceeding, and agreeing to adopt (i) all of the submissions made so far by ESH subject to its \"Supplement to Claim Memorial\" which the Tribunal understands was transmitted to Mexico on 28 January 2022, and (ii) all of the procedural steps taken in ICSID Case No. ARB/20/13.\n\nOn the same date, L1bre Holding filed a letter with the Secretary-General on behalf of the parties to ICSID Case No. ARB/21/55, copying the Tribunal, notifying the parties' agreement to discontinue ICSID Case No. ARB/21/55 upon dispatch of the present order adding L1bre Holding as a claimant to ICSID Case No. ARB/20/13.\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Mexico informed the Tribunal that it did not have any comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 2.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Mexico confirmed its agreement with the content of the submission made on March 1, 2022, by the representatives of L1bre Holding and ESH in ICSID Case No. ARB/21/55.\n\nOn March 4, 6 and 7, 2022, the Members of the Tribunal signed their respective updated declarations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n**Order**\n---------\n\nFurther to the Parties' agreement, the Tribunal orders as follows:\n\n1.

THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimants are Esp\u00edritu Santo Holdings, LP (\"**ESH**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the province of Alberta, Canada, and L1bre Holding, LLC (\"**L1bre Holding**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America (collectively, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe responding party is the United Mexican States (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Mexico**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 March 2022, the Claimants submitted an application for provisional measures in accordance with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, and NAFTA Article 1134, together with exhibits C-0129 through C-0149 and legal authorities CL-0119 through CL-0142 (the \"**Application**\"). The Application seeks urgent protection from a set of criminal actions brought by Mexico in relation to this Arbitration and involving the Claimants\u2019 corporate representatives and fact witnesses in this proceeding, Mr. Eduardo Zayas Due\u00f1as and Mr. Santiago Le\u00f3n Aveleyra.\n\n5.\n\nIn their letter of the same day, the Claimants proposed a briefing schedule on the Application, suggested that one day is reserved in the event the Tribunal or the Parties seek a hearing on the Application, and requested that the Tribunal issue a ruling on the relief sought once it has reached a decision on this matter, with the reasoned decision to follow at the Tribunal\u2019s convenience.\n\n6.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the briefing schedule proposed by the Claimants by 21 March 2022.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 March 2022, the Respondent suggested an alternative schedule and requested that the main proceeding be suspended until the Tribunal render a decision on the Application.\n\n8.\n\nOn 22 March 2022, the Claimants sought leave to reply to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 21 March 2022, which the Tribunal granted. In their reply of the same day, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s alternative briefing schedule and its request for a suspension of the main proceeding.\n\n9.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent sought leave to respond to the Claimants\u2019 letter of 22 March 2022, which the Tribunal granted.\n\n10.\n\nOn 23 March 2022, the Respondent reiterated its request to have the main proceeding suspended and asked, in the alternative, to be granted an extension of at least six weeks after the conclusion of the written phase and the hearing on the Application, if any, to file its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n11.\n\nOn 25 March 2022, the Tribunal established a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Application and granted the Respondent a one-week extension to file its Counter-Memorial.\n\n12.\n\nOn 25 April 2022, the Respondent submitted its response on the Application together with exhibits R-0009 through R-0042, and legal authorities RL-0013 through RL-0042 (the \"**Response**\") opposing the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n13.\n\nOn 5 May 2022, the Claimants submitted their reply on the Application together with exhibits C-0150 through C-0156, and legal authorities CL-0143 through CL-0145 (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn 16 May 2022, the Respondent submitted its rejoinder on the Application together with exhibits R-0161 through R-0163 and legal authorities RL-0152 and RL-0153 (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n**III. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimants****\u2019 P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants seek urgent protection from the Respondent\u2019s criminal actions against, among others, the Claimants\u2019 corporate representatives and fact witnesses, Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n, which have resulted in the incarceration of Mr. Zayas (the \"**Criminal Actions**\"). These criminal actions are described further in section 1 below.\n\n16.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to order the following:\n\na. that Mexico take all actions necessary to immediately stay the criminal actions during the pendency of this Arbitration, and refrain from taking any further related actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n during the pendency of the Arbitration;\n\nb. that Mexico take all actions necessary to end the pre-trial detention of Mr. Zayas and ensure his freedom during the pendency of the Arbitration;\n\nc. that Mexico take all measures necessary to immediately suspend all criminal investigations against Mr. Le\u00f3n until the Tribunal issues a final award in this Arbitration, including withdrawing all requests for Mr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s extradition;\n\nd. that Mexico refrain from engaging in any conduct that may directly or indirectly affect the legal or physical integrity of Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n;\n\ne. that Mexico refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas and/or Mr. Le\u00f3n, or otherwise relating to the present Arbitration or the Concession;\n\nf. that Mexico suspend and/or refrain from initiating any legal proceedings in which it seeks the determination of issues by the Mexican courts that fall to be determined exclusively in the present Arbitration (including, without limitation, with respect to the validity of the Concession);\n\ng. that Mexico refrain from engaging in any other course of action that might aggravate the dispute between the parties or jeopardize the procedural integrity of this Arbitration;\n\nh. that Mexico pay the Claimants\u2019 costs associated with this Application; and\n\ni. any further or alternative interim relief that the Tribunal considers just and appropriate (together \"the **Requested Measures**\").1\n\nApplication paras. 21, 132.\n\n17.\n\nAs explained in section 2 below, the Claimants submit that they meet the required legal test for this Tribunal to grant the Requested Measures.\n\n**(1) The Criminal Actions**\n----------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the criminal actions in dispute can be categorized in two groups.\n\n19.\n\nThe first group refers to criminal actions involving the legality of the June 2016 Concession that Mexico, through the *\"Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad\"* (\"**Semovi**\"), granted Lusad, a company ESH established for the purpose of operating the Concession. The Concession was awarded following a \"Declaration of Necessity\" procedure, which is the legal framework pursuant to which Mexico City\u2019s governmental departments may grant concessions to private actors when private investment is needed.2 Under the Concession, Lusad had the exclusive right to install digital taximeters in Mexico City and to develop a mobile ride-hailing application for taxis.3\n\nApplication, para. 24.\n\nApplication, para. 7.\n\n20.\n\nThe second group refers to alleged reprisals against the Claimants\u2019 corporate representatives and fact witnesses, Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n.4\n\nApplication, para. 6.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent is involved in these criminal investigations. In particular, they contend that these actions are being advanced by a special prosecutor within Mexico\u2019s executive branch and in coordination with the Respondent\u2019s counsel in this Arbitration.5 In this regard, they argue that the Criminal Actions are being pursued in response to the filing of this Arbitration and as part of Mexico\u2019s defense strategy. These actions, according to the Claimants, *\"interfer[e] with Claimants\u2019 due process rights, undermin[e] the Tribunal\u2019s ability to carry out its mandate by intimidating key witnesses, and thus, aggravat[e] the dispute\"*.6\n\nReply, para. 3.\n\nApplication, para. 19.\n\n22.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, denying the Requested Measures would *\"countenance Mexico\u2019s abuse of its criminal justice system, setting a dangerous precedent and imperiling this arbitral proceeding\"*7\n\nReply, para. 5.\n\n***a. The Criminal Actions Relating to the Concession\u2019s Legality***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mexico has fabricated charges to criminalize the Concession. In their view, these charges are abusive, illegitimate, and were brought with the purpose to delegitimise the Concession as well as intimidate government employees who could provide testimony in this Arbitration adverse to Mexico\u2019s interests.8\n\nApplication, para. 59.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they are aware of at least [REDACED] in Mexico, which directly relate to [REDACED]. These are:\n\na. [REDACED] These charges were brought against [REDACED] Mr. Zayas filed an *amparo* action against the arrest warrant, which was suspended in October 2021.9\n\nThe Claimants submit that the First Criminal Charges are *\"demonstrably false\"*10They argue that [REDACED].12\n\nThe Claimants submit that, since the filing of this Arbitration, Mexico has revived its First Criminal Charges despite there being no new facts or evidence. In the Claimants\u2019 view, this revival \"*can therefore only be explained as a reprisal for the NAFTA claims, an attempt to intimidate [Mr. Zayas] as a witness, and to otherwise interfere with his obligations as a corporate representative for Claimants.\"*13\n\nb. [REDACED].14\n\nc. [REDACED].15\n\nApplication, paras. 11, 64.\n\nApplication, para. 11.\n\nReply, para. 16.\n\nApplication, para. 60.\n\nApplication, paras. 11, 51.\n\nApplication, paras. 11, 52.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants submit that these Criminal Actions constitute Mexico\u2019s *post-hoc* attempt to invalidate the Concession after it was suspended.16\n\nApplication, para. 12; Reply, para. 2.\n\n26.\n\nIn particular, they submit that it was only after the filing of this Arbitration that Mexico took action against Mr. Zayas and Semovi in connection with the Concession. The Claimants argue that, from the moment the Concession was granted until its suspension, Mexico repeatedly acknowledged the validity and legality of the Concession, which was granted according to a public, transparent, and competitive procurement process. According to the Claimants, Mexico likewise confirmed Lusad\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the Concession on various occasions.17\n\nApplication, paras. 12, 31-40.\n\n27.\n\nFurthermore, they contend that the files of the Criminal Actions evidence that there is a connection between these charges and the Arbitration, despite the fact that the Arbitration should be irrelevant to any legitimate pursuit of criminal charges against former and/or current government employees.18 According to the Claimants, the files further reveal that the Respondent\u2019s counsel in this Arbitration has communicated and shared documents, including confidential documents, related to the NAFTA claims with the prosecutor\u2019s office.19\n\nApplication, para. 53.\n\nApplication, paras. 13, 55-58.\n\n***b. Other Reprisals Against the Claimants\u2019 Corporate Representatives and Fact Witnesses***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent is illegitimately pursuing parallel actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n as part of *\"Mexico's campaign of retribution and intimidation against Claimants' corporate representatives and witnesses**20* (the \"**Fourth Criminal Charges**\").\n\nApplication, para. 15.\n\n29.\n\nThe Fourth Criminal Charges concern [REDACED].22According to the Claimants, this \"*civil fraud dispute*\" lay dormant for years and any action in relation to the business transaction had already prescribed.23\n\nApplication, para. 67.\n\nApplication, paras. 16, 77.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the files of the Fourth Criminal Charges \"*reveal a coordinated motive*\"24 because they show that the special prosecutor was not seeking evidence to further any criminal investigation but rather focused its investigation on Lusad, which had no relation with the 2014 business deal.25 They further submit that [REDACED] even though this entity did not exist until 2017, implies \"*some behind the scenes collusion*.\"26 Thus, in the Claimants\u2019 view, this criminal investigation is *\"another front being exploited to disrupt and attack Claimants' witnesses and these Arbitration proceedings*.27\n\nApplication, para. 17.\n\nApplication, para. 17.\n\nReply, para. 12.\n\nApplication, para. 71.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants state that, as a result of these actions, on 9 December 2021 the prosecutor sought arrest warrants against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n in relation to these charges.28 Mr. Zayas was arrested on 22 December 2021.29 In a 24 December 2021 court hearing, his request to be released pending trial was denied, and, to date, Mr. Zayas remains in pre-trial detention.30 According to the Claimants, Mr. Zayas is being held in *\"deplorable, dangerous, and unsanitary conditions, and his mental health [has been] suffering as a result.*\"31 They submit that Mr. Zayas\u2019 detention is *\"arbitrary, unlawful, violates his fundamental human right to liberty and due process.*\"32\n\nApplication, para. 72.\n\nApplication, para. 74.\n\nApplication, para. 75.\n\nReply, para. 2.\n\nApplication, para. 75.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants challenge Mr. Zayas\u2019 preventive incarceration as \"*highly unusual and extraordinary\"*33*.* The Claimants submit that under Mexican law defendants are entitled to pre-trial release, particularly for minor crimes. Moreover, Mexico\u2019s National Code of Criminal Procedure provides for precautionary procedures to ensure that the accused appears in court, such as travel restrictions, electronic monitoring, periodic appearances before a judge, economic guarantees, and house arrest. The Claimants contend that Mr. Zayas\u2019 defense team was hindered from requesting these conditions during his bail hearing, and that Mexico\u2019s refusal to apply these routine bail conditions *\"only further demonstrates its retaliatory motive and bad faith.*\"34 The Claimants affirm that Mr. Zayas will appear when required and note that he would accept conditions on his release to ensure that he is available for trial.35\n\nReply, para. 17.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id*.\n\n33.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants contend that, as a result of his imprisonment, Mr. Zayas is unable to provide instructions to the Claimants\u2019 counsel in this Arbitration, thereby limiting the evidence that the Claimants\u2019 witnesses are able to provide.36\n\nApplication, para. 19.\n\n34.\n\nAs to Mr. Le\u00f3n, the Claimants note that he is currently in the U.S., and that [REDACTED].37\n\nApplication, paras. 81, 82.\n\n35.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants take issue with the Respondent\u2019s reliance on unrelated cases involving Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. In their view, these cases are *\"entirely disconnected\"* from the Criminal Actions and did not result in any criminal actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n.38 According to the Claimants, the Respondent relies on these cases solely to defame Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n and to distract the Tribunal from the relevant facts.39\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\n*Id*.\n\n***c. Mexico's Harassment and Intimidation of the Claimants' Witnesses***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that, after Mr. Zayas\u2019 arrest, the Respondent has continued to harass and intimidate the Claimants\u2019 witnesses, in particular by releasing confidential information to local media \"*in order to encourage stories portraying Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n in a negative light, and encouraging others to file fraud claims against the representatives of Lusad\".*40\n\nApplication, para. 78.\n\n**(2) Legal Analysis**\n----------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 1134 of NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) expressly authorize the Tribunal to order provisional measures.41\n\nApplication, paras. 86-90.\n\n38.\n\nRelying on ICSID cases,42 they state that there is *\"substantial precedent\"* for ordering provisional measures to enjoin domestic criminal actions in respondent States where they imperil a claimant\u2019s right to pursue its claims through its officers or witnesses.43\n\n*Ipek Investment Limited v.

They contend that, by ratifying the ICSID Convention, *\"Mexico 'has accepted that an ICSID tribunal may order measures on a provisional basis, even in a situation which may entail some interference with sovereign powers and enforcement duties.*'46\n\nReply, para. 19.\n\n***a.*** **Prima Facie** ***Case on Jurisdiction and the Merits***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction, and they have established a *prima facie* claim on the merits.47\n\nApplication, paras. 92, 93.\n\n44.\n\nAs to the Tribunal\u2019s *prima facie* jurisdiction, they submit that:\n\na. the Application is made by ESH and L1bre, which are nationals of Canada and the U.S., respectively;\n\nb. ESH brought the claim before NAFTA was terminated, and, under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, Mexico consented to refer to ICSID arbitration claims brought by Canadian and U.S. investors;\n\nc. ESH also consented to ICSID arbitration;\n\nd. while L1bre brought its claim after NAFTA was terminated, in the USMCA Mexico has agreed that certain legacy claims - such as L1bre\u2019s claims - may be brought to arbitration under NAFTA until July 1, 2023;\n\ne. Mexico is a signatory and has ratified the ICSID Convention;\n\nf. the Claimants are owners of an enterprise in Mexico that held the Concession and thus made an investment in Mexico; and\n\ng. the Claimants have shown that they have satisfied all prerequisites and time limitations for the filing of claims under NAFTA.48\n\nApplication, para. 92.\n\n45.\n\nAs to their *prima facie* case on the merits, the Claimants contend that insofar as their factual assertions in their Memorial on the Merits and its Addendum hold, the Tribunal might possibly conclude that an award could be made in the Claimants\u2019 favour.49\n\nApplication, para. 93.\n\n***b. The Requested Measures Would Preserve the Claimants\u2019 Rights***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Requested Measures are needed to protect the procedural integrity of the Arbitration, preserve the *status quo* and avoid the aggravation of the dispute, and protect the exclusivity of this ICSID proceeding.50\n\nApplication, para. 98.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that ICSID tribunals have confirmed that they may order provisional measures to protect these set of rights, including in cases involving domestic criminal proceedings.51\n\nApplication, paras. 98-101.\n\n***c. The Requested Measures are Necessary***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants submit that ICSID tribunals have held that provisional measures are necessary when they enable the avoidance of a substantial or serious harm that would not adequately be reparable by an award of damages.52\n\nApplication, para. 103.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Mexico\u2019s Criminal Actions have and will continue to cause harm to the Claimants and their set of rights, i.e., (i) the protection of the procedural integrity of the Arbitration; (ii) the preservation of the *status quo* and the avoidance of the aggravation of the dispute; and (iii) the protection of the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.53\n\nApplication, para. 110.\n\n**(i) The Procedural Integrity of this Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the procedural integrity of this Arbitration is compromised by the Criminal Actions because (i) Mexico\u2019s targeting of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses has a chilling effect on their ability to provide unadulterated testimony; (ii) the actions against the Semovi officials are likely to silence them; and (iii)[REDACTED], he will not be available to provide live testimony and, in any event, such testimony would be compromised by the fact that he is testifying against the State that is detaining him.54 Relying on ICSID case law, the Claimants argue that provisional measures designed to protect the procedural integrity of the proceedings, are, by definition, necessary.55\n\nApplication, para. 105.\n\nApplication, para. 110.\n\n51.\n\nFurthermore, they submit that, given that Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n represent and manage the Claimants, the Criminal Actions create practical impediments for the pursuit of their claims because Mr. Zayas is unable to provide instructions and gather relevant documentary evidence, or provide additional written testimony. Furthermore, they contend that if Mexico succeeds in extraditing Mr. Le\u00f3n, the Claimants would be left without either of their corporate representatives or fact witnesses.56 In this regard, the Claimants argue that numerous tribunals have acknowledged the risks that criminal proceedings brought against the representatives or witnesses of a party to the arbitration pose to the procedural integrity of an arbitration, particularly where such proceedings are illegitimate, retaliatory or otherwise suspect.57\n\nApplication, para. 106.\n\nApplication, para. 107.\n\n52.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants express doubts as to whether the Respondent will facilitate Mr. Zayas\u2019 remote appearance in the hearing, as stated in the Response, and note that, in any event, the fact that Mr. Zayas is incarcerated may have a chilling effect on his testimony.58 Further, in their view the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Claimants\u2019 counsel is able to visit Mr. Zayas in prison is *\"disingenuous\"* because, among others, the Claimants\u2019 counsel is not allowed to bring a laptop, has limited ability to bring in documents, and cannot speak to Mr. Zayas in a confidential setting.59\n\nReply, para. 25.\n\nReply, para. 26.\n\n**(ii)** ***Status Quo*** **and Non-Aggravation of the Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the preservation of the *status quo* is a core function of provisional measures in ICSID arbitration.60 In this regard, they submit that the Criminal Actions, in particular the incarceration of Mr. Zayas and the threat to Mr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s freedom, have disrupted the *status quo*.\n\nApplication, para. 112.\n\n54.\n\nFurther, they argue that Mexico\u2019s actions have aggravated the dispute as they have arguably given rise to a new cause of action for moral damages caused to Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n.61 In their view, the dispute will continue to be aggravated so long as the Respondent continues pursuing the Criminal Actions and harassing the Claimants\u2019 witnesses.62\n\nApplication, para. 114.\n\nApplication, para. 115.\n\n**(iii) Exclusivity of ICSID Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, in accordance with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, once the subject matter of a dispute is before an ICSID tribunal the parties must withdraw or stay any and all judicial proceedings commenced before national courts in connection with the dispute before the ICSID tribunal.63\n\nApplication, paras. 116, 117.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants contend that [REDACTED], which is at the heart of this Arbitration, violate the principle of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings. Furthermore, they argue that, through these charges, the Respondent is improperly gathering evidence from the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and the Semovi officials, which is likely to be relevant to the Arbitration.64 Thus, in their view, these actions ought to be stayed to preserve the exclusivity of this proceeding.\n\nApplication, para. 118.\n\n57.\n\nAlthough the Claimants recognize that the exclusivity of this proceeding is not affected by the Fourth Criminal Charges, they contend that provisional measures are required to enjoin them and free Mr. Zayas.65\n\nApplication, para. 119.\n\n***d. The Requested Measures are Urgent***\n------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the accepted standard for the \"urgency\" test is whether the requested measures must be granted while an arbitration remains pending and before the issuance of an award.66\n\nApplication, para. 122.\n\n59.\n\nFurther, they submit that when the rights at issue involve the procedural integrity of an arbitration, the non-aggravation of the dispute, and preserving the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings, \"*the need for provisional measures is by definition urgent*.\"67\n\nApplication, para. 126.\n\n60.\n\nThey thus conclude that the Requested Measures are urgent because, otherwise, the Claimants\u2019 ability to pursue their claims in this Arbitration will be affected.68\n\n*Id*.\n\n***e. The Requested Measures are Proportionate***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Tribunal must determine whether the harm the Requested Measures intend to prevent outweighs any harm that these measures would cause to the Respondent.69\n\nApplication, para. 127.\n\n62.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 position that even though investigating and prosecuting crimes is a sovereign power, tribunals have held that, by signing the ICSID Convention, the contracting parties have accepted some limitation on these powers. Further, they submit that tribunals have routinely held that orders suspending criminal proceedings are proportionate when the criminal proceedings are likely to affect a claimant\u2019s ability to present its case, and the proceedings are only stayed during the pendency of the arbitration.70\n\nApplication, para. 129.\n\n63.\n\nGiven that the Requested Measures are only sought during the pendency of this Arbitration, the Claimants submit that they are appropriately proportionate.71\n\nApplication, para. 130.\n\n**B. T****he** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Criminal Actions are not mechanisms of retaliation against the Claimants and Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n, but rather derive from the existence of potential illicit acts.72\n\nResponse, para. 2.\n\n65.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that the Claimants\u2019 allegations regarding the criminal actions do not meet the required threshold for the Tribunal to grant the Requested Measures. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimants *\"seek to use the arbitral proceedings to undermine the rule of law in Mexico and seek to overturn decisions of domestic courts through this arbitration.\"*73\n\n*Id*.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\na. dismiss the Claimants\u2019 Application in its entirety;\n\nb. safeguard the Respondent\u2019s rights to rebut various factual and legal allegations made by the Claimants in their Application; and\n\nc. order the Claimants to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in relation to the Application.74\n\nResponse, para. 166.\n\n**(1) The Criminal Actions**\n----------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"*the criminal investigations faced by Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n are carried out in strict accordance with the law,\"*75 and that, through these charges, Mexico only seeks to clarify \"*facts related to possible crimes, which is a sovereign right inherent to any democratic State*.\"76\n\nResponse, para. 25.\n\n*Id*.\n\n68.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a NAFTA arbitration does not grant immunity from criminal investigations and sanctions.77 It submits that Mexican authorities, including Semovi, are under an obligation to report any activity that could constitute a crime, and Mexico\u2019s Public Prosecutor, which is an autonomous body, has a constitutional mandate to investigate and prosecute crimes.78\n\nResponse, para. 3.\n\nResponse, para. 13; Rejoinder, para. 4.\n\n69.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n maintain their constitutional rights to participate in these investigations and challenge any action or omission that affects their rights. In this regard, the Respondent notes that Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n have indeed filed several *amparo* proceedings in relation to the criminal investigations, which are currently pending.79\n\nResponse, paras. 14, 15; Rejoinder, para. 1.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent contends that because these investigations are secret and confidential, its counsel does not have access to the relevant files as opposed to the Claimants\u2019 counsel. It alleges, however, that based on the information available to it, the Claimants have omitted \"*important details*\" regarding these Criminal Actions.80 Further, in its view, the Application does not meet the threshold necessary for the Tribunal to order the Requested Measures.81\n\nResponse, para. 5.\n\nResponse, para. 42.\n\n***a. The First Criminal Charges***\n-----------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nWith respect to the First Criminal Charges, the Respondent submits that they were brought before this Arbitration was commenced. In particular, Semovi filed its complaint four months before L1bre Holding submitted its Notice of Intent and six months before ESH filed its Notice of Intent.82\n\nResponse, para. 65.\n\n72.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that the arrest warrant against Mr. Zayas in relation to the First Criminal Charges was issued [REDACED].83\n\nResponse, para. 69.\n\n73.\n\nFinally, the Respondent emphasizes that, as noted in the Application, Mr. Zayas obtained a suspension of the arrest warrant. According to the Respondent, what the Claimants omit mentioning is that the court order granting the suspension also required Mr. Zayas to, among others, make certain appearances before the relevant judge, [REDACED].84\n\nResponse, para. 72; Rejoinder, para. 5.\n\n***b. The Second Criminal Charges***\n------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Second Criminal Charges are being advanced by Mexico\u2019s prosecutor \"*in full adherence to the applicable legal framework\"*85 With respect to these charges, the Respondent makes the following remarks.\n\nResponse, para. 95.\n\n75.\n\n*First,* the Respondent notes that this criminal investigation was initiated approximately six months before the Claimants submitted their Memorial in this Arbitration, and do not involve neither Mr. Zayas nor Mr. Le\u00f3n.86\n\nResponse, para. 83.\n\n76.\n\n*Second,* the Respondent takes issue with the Claimants\u2019 argument that the charges are abusive and were brought for the purpose of intimidating Semovi employees. In particular, the Respondent notes that the charged Semovi officials have not participated in this Arbitration, and the Claimants have not indicated their intention to present the testimony of any official or former official of Semovi.87\n\n*Id.*\n\n77.\n\n*Third,* the Respondent disagrees with the Claimants\u2019 contention that these investigations are illegitimate. The Respondent notes that the Claimants have failed to mention that [REDACED] that more than 254 taxi drivers in Mexico City filed an *amparo* lawsuit against the \"Declaration of Necessity\", or that an Administrative District Court has ruled, among others, that neither Semovi nor the Adjudication Committee were empowered to grant a concession such as the one awarded by the \"Declaration of Necessity\" process.88\n\nResponse, paras. 87, 88.\n\n78.\n\n*Fourth*, and contrary to the Claimants\u2019 assertion, the Respondent submits that it has not supplied documents from the Arbitration to Mexico\u2019s prosecutors in charge of investigating these criminal charges.89\n\nResponse, para. 94.\n\n***c. The Third Criminal Charges***\n-----------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these charges refer to [REDACED]. In the Respondent\u2019s view, by bringing these charges the Mexican authorities were only fulfilling their obligations to report and investigate possible illicit acts.90\n\nResponse, para. 99.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these charges do not involve Mr. Zayas nor Mr. Le\u00f3n, and do not have any impact on the Arbitration.91\n\nResponse, para. 103.\n\n81.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that Mexico\u2019s counsel in this Arbitration has been sharing documents with Semovi with respect to these charges, the Respondent confirms that it has exchanged information with Semovi in order to prepare its defense in the Arbitration and respond to the Application.92 The Respondent notes that, in any event, these documents are public, were provided by the Claimants themselves, and can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Economy.93\n\nResponse, para. 101.\n\nResponse, para. 102.\n\n***d. The Fourth Criminal Charges***\n------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nWith respect to the Fourth Criminal Charges, the Respondent argues that the prosecutor is carrying out the investigation in accordance with the applicable legal framework, and that these investigations *\"[do] not constitute an action of retaliation or persecution against Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n*94 With respect to these charges, the Respondent submits as follows.\n\nResponse, para. 63.\n\n83.\n\n*First,* the complaint that gave rise to these investigations was filed one year before the Claimants\u2019 Memorial by a[REDACED] national, [REDACED] who has no ties to the Mexican government.95\n\nResponse, para. 43.\n\n84.\n\n*Second*, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 contention, these investigations do not relate to a \"dormant\" dispute. The Respondent notes that the complainant has not withdrawn her complaint and that at least three other individuals have complained that they too were defrauded by the Claimants\u2019 witnesses.96\n\nResponse, para. 53.\n\n85.\n\n*Third,* the prosecutor was under a duty to investigate Ms. P\u00e9rez\u2019 complaint pursuant to its constitutional mandate to investigate any criminal activity. In the Respondent\u2019s view, these charges *\"cannot be equated with a 'retaliation\u2019 against the Claimants and their witnesses.*\"97\n\nResponse, para. 56.\n\n86.\n\n*Fourth,* the arrest warrants issued against Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n were requested by the prosecutor due to a \"need for caution\", as provided by Article 141 of the Mexican National Code of Criminal Procedures. The Respondent contends that, [REDACED].98\n\nResponse, para. 49.\n\n87.\n\n*Fifth,* during the hearing of 24 December 2021 regarding the arrest warrant, the judge considered that there were grounds to impose pre-trial detention. Mr. Zayas was accompanied by his counsel during the hearing, who was able to defend him. The judge also informed Mr. Zayas that he could negotiate a reparation agreement with the victims given that the charges pertained to property crimes, which would put an end to the criminal investigations. According to the Respondent, Mr. Zayas did not avail himself of this right.99\n\nResponse, para. 57.\n\n88.\n\n*Sixth,* Mr. Le\u00f3n obtained a suspension of the arrest warrant issued against him but, as he did not appear before the judge, the suspension was revoked.100\n\nResponse, para. 61.\n\n89.\n\n*Seventh,* in good faith and to the extent possible, the Respondent undertakes to request the prosecutor\u2019s and/or Mexico\u2019s judicial authorities\u2019 support in ensuring that Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n participate remotely in the hearing and that the Claimants\u2019 counsel can work with Mr. Zayas in a confidential setting should Mr. Zayas\u2019 legal situation remain the same in the future.101 In this regard, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to prove their contention that their counsel has been unable to visit Mr. Zayas in prison.102\n\nResponse, para. 10.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1.\n\n**(2) Other Proceedings Involving Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants omit mentioning other legal proceedings in Mexico and the United States involving Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n, in which their business dealings have likewise been challenged. The Respondent particularly refers to the following proceedings:\n\na. ***Esp\u00edritu Santo Holdings v. L1bero Partners and Esp\u00edritu Santo Technologies****.* This proceeding relates to a legal battle between the partners of the L1bre Project, the group comprised of Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n, and one of Lusad\u2019s shareholders, Mr. Covarrubias, and L1bero Partners LP. This dispute led to various civil and criminal proceedings in Mexico and the United States, including an ICC arbitration, in which the partners mutually accused each other of theft, fraud and embezzlement.103\n\nb. ***Commercial Litigation 191/2019****,* which refers to a commercial lawsuit filed by Lusad against Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n for having carried out various acts on behalf of Lusad without the required powers.104\n\nResponse, paras. 29-35.\n\nResponse, paras. 37, 38.\n\n91.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the existence of these additional proceedings undermines the credibility of the Claimants\" Application.105\n\nResponse, para. 27.\n\n**(3) Legal Analysis**\n----------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent submits that to grant the Requested Measures, the Tribunal must determine that (i) it has *prima facie* jurisdiction; (ii) there is a right that could be affected and there is a *prima facie* case; and (iii) the measures are necessary, urgent and proportional.106\n\nResponse, para. 114.\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to meet the *\"high evidentiary standard\"* for this Tribunal to order provisional measures under Article 1134 NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.107 In this regard, the Respondent submits that tribunals have been extremely cautious when deciding to grant provisional measures to avoid interfering with domestic criminal proceedings.108 In its view, \"*an investment arbitration, and mainly a phase of provisional measures, cannot and should not affect the sovereign right of a State to investigate and punish crimes.\"*109\n\nResponse, para. 106.\n\nResponse, para. 109.\n\nResponse, para. 113.\n\n***a. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction to Grant the Requested Measures***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants conflate the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve the disputes underlying this Arbitration with the Tribunal\u2019s \"competence\" to grant the Requested Measures.110\n\nResponse, para. 117.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that the Tribunal has the power to grant provisional measures under the applicable rules. However, it contends that the Tribunal is not competent to grant these measures because (i) they would affect the rights of third parties, namely the victims who denounced the alleged criminal activity that gave rise to the Criminal Actions, (ii) the facts that underlie the Criminal Actions occurred before the Claimants filed their claims in this Arbitration, and (iii) Mexico\u2019s prosecutor was obliged to investigate these possible crimes according to its constitutional mandate.111\n\nResponse, para. 123.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the measures requested by the Claimants *\"would create a dangerous and disruptive precedent,\"*112 which would empower investor-State tribunals to resolve criminal complaints as a domestic court, release detainees, suspend criminal investigations, suspend arrest warrants or extradition procedures, and affect the rights of complainants.113\n\nResponse, para. 124.\n\n*Id.*\n\n97.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent notes that NAFTA does not exempt any member from applying its internal laws, nor does it provide immunity against criminal investigations.114\n\nResponse, para. 121.\n\n***b. The Claimants Have Not Made a*** **Prima Facie** ***Showing of a Right that Could be Affected***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the Criminal Actions have affected the integrity of this Arbitration, aggravated the dispute, or affected the exclusivity of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.115\n\nResponse, para. 127.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent further takes issue with the case law relied on by the Claimants. In its view, none of the cases cited in the Application are analogous to this dispute and, thus, they do not justify granting the Requested Measures.116\n\nResponse, para. 126; Rejoinder, para. 14.\n\n**(i) The Integrity of the Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has neither affected the integrity of the proceedings nor the Claimants\u2019 ability to participate in this Arbitration. In particular, the Respondent states that it has a genuine interest in Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n participating in the Arbitration so that it can exercise its right to cross-examine them during the hearing and challenge their witness statements.117\n\nResponse, para. 129.\n\n101.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the time period that has elapsed since Mr. Zayas\u2019 detention and the fact that the Claimants had knowledge of the criminal investigations prior to initiating this Arbitration is proof that the integrity of the Arbitration has not been affected.118\n\nResponse, para. 130.\n\n**(ii) The Dispute has not Been Aggravated**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a tribunal may only grant provisional measures if there are substantive and procedural rights that ought to be protected during the arbitration and that must be preserved before the tribunal resolves the jurisdictional issues or the merits of the claim.119\n\nResponse, para. 131.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 rights have not been aggravated; rather, the Claimants are seeking to immunize their witnesses from the application of the law. In particular, the Respondent submits that:\n\na. Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n face arrest warrants because Mexico\u2019s prosecutor proved to the judges that there was a \"need for caution\" that justified their incarceration;120\n\nb. it is still premature to determine whether Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n will be criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison. In fact, it is possible that Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n obtain favourable judgments;121\n\nc. Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n have at their disposal domestic legal mechanisms to exercise their rights;122\n\nd. the Claimants were aware of the criminal investigations prior to bringing this Arbitration;123\n\ne. the Claimants\u2019 witnesses, mainly Mr. Zayas, has an extensive history of complaints filed against him;124\n\nf. the Fourth Criminal Charges do not have a \"strong linkage\" with this Arbitration;125 and\n\ng. Mexican authorities did not coordinate the timing of the investigations or the issuance of the arrest warrants. Criminal investigations take time, especially considering the complexity of the facts and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the fact that the investigations that began between 2018 and 2021 are still ongoing is not attributable to Mexico.126\n\nResponse, para. 133.\n\nResponse, para. 136.\n\n*Id*.\n\nResponse, para. 134.\n\nResponse, para. 137.\n\nResponse, para. 138.\n\nResponse, para. 139.\n\n**(iii) The Exclusivity of ICSID Proceedings Has Not Been Affected**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent contends that issues arising during the course of criminal proceedings will generally not fall within the jurisdiction of an investor-State tribunal. In its view, in several investment cases, including cases relied on by the Claimants, tribunals have rejected the argument that the exclusivity of an ICSID arbitration may be affected by domestic criminal proceedings as such proceedings do not involve claims similar in nature or subject to investment arbitration.127\n\nResponse, paras. 141-145.\n\n105.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that the Fourth Criminal Charges are unrelated to this Arbitration, and that there are no reasons to suppose that the exclusivity of the ICSID proceeding has been violated.128\n\nResponse, para. 142.\n\n***c. The Requested Measures are not Necessary***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a measure will be necessary if its purpose is to prevent substantial or irreparable damage to the rights of one of the parties. Further, it contends that, in line with the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, investment tribunals have concluded that the requesting party must meet a high standard to show that a measure is necessary.129\n\nResponse, para. 147.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to show irreparable damage or a serious risk considering the following facts:\n\na. Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n have evaded the prosecutor\u2019s and judges\u2019 orders;\n\nb. the special prosecutor demonstrated that the detention of Mr. Zayas was warranted;\n\nc. the criminal investigations that Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n face were initiated by complaints filed by private parties;\n\nd. Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n have legal remedies they can resort to at the appropriate procedural time;\n\ne. investment arbitration cannot serve as a mechanism to provide immunity from claims filed by private parties;\n\nf. in the event the legal situation of Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n does not change, the Respondent will request the relevant authorities to ensure their remote appearance;\n\ng. the legal situation of Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n remains uncertain and may change in the near future; and\n\nh. the Claimants\u2019 counsel is able to visit Mr. Zayas in prison to provide him with information regarding the Arbitration and assist him with preparing his second witness statement.130\n\nResponse, para. 148; Rejoinder, paras. 14-15.\n\n***d. The Requested Measures are not Urgent***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the requirements of necessity and urgency are related and that, with respect to the latter, the Claimants must prove that \"*the tribunal cannot wait until the award is issued to prevent irreparable harm from occurring.*131\n\nResponse, para. 150.\n\n109.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants have not shown any urgency. The Respondent emphasizes that the Claimants were aware of the existence of some of these criminal investigations prior to submitting their Memorial, and that they waited three months from the arrest of Mr. Zayas before submitting their Application.132\n\nResponse, paras. 152, 153; Rejoinder, para. 16.\n\n110.\n\nBased on the above, the Respondent concludes that the Requested Measures are neither urgent nor necessary.\n\n***e. The Requested Measures are not Proportional***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal must strike a balance between the Claimants\u2019 alleged harm and the potential harm that the Requested Measures may cause to Mexico. It contends that the Tribunal must *\"show special care* when granting provisional measures in order not to affect the Claimants\u2019 rights, and, at the same time, *\"the sovereign rights of a State, such as for example to investigate possible illicit conduct*.\"133\n\nResponse, para. 155.\n\n112.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent submits that the Requested Measures are disproportionate as they would require the Tribunal to act as a Mexican court to order the suspension of the criminal investigations and revoke the arrest warrants and the pre-trial detention.134\n\nResponse, para. 163.\n\n113.\n\nFurther, in its view, investment tribunals should be cautious when granting provisional measures in instances in which they might affect third parties who are exercising their rights, such as the private parties who initiated some of the criminal investigations against Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n.135\n\nResponse, para. 161; Rejoinder, para. 17.\n\n114.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that tribunals must be careful when granting provisional measures in instances which involve *\"a degree of speculation.\"* In this regard, the Respondent submits that the Criminal Actions are at an early stage and, thus, the legal situation of Messrs. Zayas and Le\u00f3n might change in the near future.136\n\nResponse, para. 161.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by observing that its power to order or recommend provisional measures is well-established under the rules applicable to this arbitration. Article 1134 NAFTA provides:\n\n*Article 1134: Interim Measures of Protection. A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation*.\n\n116.\n\nThe ICSID Convention confirms this power in Article 47:\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n117.\n\nFinally, the ICSID Rules of Arbitration provide in Rule 39(1):\n\n*At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures*.\n\n118.\n\nThe Parties agree that a party requesting provisional measures must satisfy five requirements: (i) *prima facie* jurisdiction;137 (ii) *prima facie* case;138 (iii) necessity;139 (iv) proportionality;140 and (v) urgency.141 These requirements enjoy widespread acceptance in investment arbitration.142\n\nApplication, para. 91; Response, para. 114.\n\nApplication, para. 93; Response, para. 114.\n\nApplication, para. 95; Response, para. 114.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\nCf. *Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation,* UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 7 July 2017, (hereinafter Pugachev v. Russia), para. 212 (**RL-0020**); *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, paras. 45, 46 (**CL-0126**).\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the provisional measures requested by the Claimants can be classified in two groups. The first group refers to current and future criminal actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. The second group refers to measures more general in scope, which pertain to present and future proceedings not specifically directed against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. In addition, the Claimants request that Mexico be ordered to cover the Claimants\u2019 costs associated with its application for provisional measures.143 Mexico requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Application, to safeguard the Respondent\u2019s rights to rebut various factual and legal allegations made by the Claimants in their Application, and to order the Claimants to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in relation to the Application.144\n\nApplication, paras. 21, 132.\n\nResponse, para. 166.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the request for provisional measures regarding criminal actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n (A). It will then consider the other provisional measures requested by the Claimants (B). Finally, it will address issues of costs (C) and preservation of rights (D).\n\n**A. P****rovisional** **M****easures** **C****oncerning** **C****riminal** **A****ctions against** **M****r****. Z****ayas and M****r****. L****e\u00f3n**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe first group of provisional measures requested by the Claimants pertain to criminal actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. Specifically, the Claimants request this Tribunal to: (i) require Mexico to take all actions necessary to immediately stay the Criminal Actions during the pendency of the Arbitration, and refrain from taking any further related actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n during the pendency of the Arbitration; (ii) require Mexico to take all actions necessary to end the pre-trial detention of Mr. Zayas and ensure his freedom during the pendency of the Arbitration; (iii) require Mexico to take all measures necessary to immediately suspend all criminal investigations against Mr. Le\u00f3n until the Tribunal issues an award in this Arbitration, including withdrawing all requests for Mr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s extradition; (iv) require Mexico to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may directly or indirectly affect the legal or physical integrity of Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n; (v) require Mexico to refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas and/or Mr. Le\u00f3n.145\n\nApplication, paras. 21, 132.\n\n122.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal observes, as a preliminary matter, that the Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that all requirements for granting the Requested Measures are met.146 In respect of the measures concerning the criminal actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n, the request must meet an exceptionally high standard. As noted by the Tribunal in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan, \"a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state.*\"147\n\n*Pugachev v. Russia,* para. 214 (**RL-0020**).\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. The Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 31 July 2009 (hereinafter *Caratube v. Kazakhstan),* para. 137 (**RL-0022**).\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider the requirements for a successful application for provisional measures, namely, (i) *prima facie* jurisdiction; (ii) a *prima facie* case; (iii) necessity; (iv) proportionality; and (v) urgency.148\n\nCf. para. 118 *supra.*\n\n124.\n\nAs regards *prima facie* jurisdiction, the Claimants submit that this Tribunal \"*has prima facie jurisdiction* ratione personae, ratione materiae, ratione temporis *and* ratione voluntatis*.*\"149 The Claimants further observe that the Respondent\u2019s arguments on *prima facie* jurisdiction focus on \"*the relief sought.**\"*150 For the Claimants, this line of argument \"*is incorrect and lacks any support.*\"151 In turn, the Respondent argues that the Claimants are confusing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide on the dispute with its competence to grant the provisional measures they request.152 While the Respondent does not call into question the Tribunal\u2019s authority to recommend provisional measures, it submits that this Tribunal is not competent to recommend the provisional measures the Claimants are requesting.153 The reasons are twofold. First, those measures affect third-party victims who denounced the acts allegedly committed by Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. Second, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office has an obligation to investigate and eventually prosecute crimes committed in areas under its jurisdiction.154\n\nApplication, para. 92.\n\nReply, para. 21.\n\n*Id*.\n\nResponse, para. 117.\n\nResponse, para. 119.\n\nResponse, para. 123.\n\n125.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the issue in this case is not its authority to recommend or order provisional measures in general. The wording of Article 1134 NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is broad. Depending on the specific circumstances of the case, an ICSID tribunal can order provisional measures concerning criminal proceedings. In *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, the tribunal explained:\n\n*[T]he language authorizing ICSID Tribunals in Article 47 of the Convention and Rule 39 is very broad and does not give any indication that any specific state action must be excluded from the scope of possible provisional measures. [...] this broad language can be interpreted to the effect that, in principle, criminal investigations may not be totally excluded from the scope of provisional measures in ICSID proceedings.*155\n\n*Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* para. 136 (**RL-0022**).\n\n126.\n\nNotwithstanding this broad authority to order provisional measures, analysis of *prima facie* jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding on a request for provisional measures cannot be entirely detached from the specific measures under consideration. As noted by the tribunal in *Pugachev v. Russia, \"Claimant must prove, not only that this Tribunal has prima facie jurisdiction over the general dispute, but also that it has prima facie jurisdiction for the requested interim measures.*\"156\n\n*Pugachev v. Russia,* para. 216 (**RL-0020**).\n\n127.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Tribunal cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n appear to involve third-party victims and were initiated in response to criminal complaints by third parties. This is particularly the case of the Fourth Criminal Charges, concerning fraud, which originated from a complaint filed by [REDACED] national.157 [REDACED].158 This appears to have resulted in Mr. Zayas\u2019 arrest on 22 December 2021 and an arrest warrant against Mr. Le\u00f3n.159\n\nResponse, para. 43.\n\nApplication, para. 16.\n\nApplication, paras. 72 ff.; Response, paras. 49, 50.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants were unable to justify why this Tribunal would be competent to grant provisional measures that will certainly affect the interests of persons that are not a party to this arbitration, such as [REDACED]. The Tribunal must recognize that Mexican authorities have the duty to investigate crimes committed in areas under their jurisdiction. The Tribunal shall exercise utmost restraint when it comes to provisional measures affecting third parties, in respect of which it has no jurisdiction.\n\n129.\n\nWithout prejudice to the foregoing, it is not clear that the Claimants\u2019 request would meet the other requirements for a successful application for provisional measures. The Claimants submit that \"*the Requested Measures are urgently required to ensure that the Claimants \u2019 due process rights are not affected by Mexico\u2019s pursuit of these retaliatory Criminal Actions against Claimants\u2019 corporate representatives and witnesses\".*160 They assert that the criminal actions against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n are a retaliation for the initiation of the NAFTA arbitration. The Tribunal cannot conclude that this has been established satisfactorily.\n\nApplication, para. 131.\n\n130.\n\nThe timing of the criminal actions directly and specifically involving Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n (the First Criminal Charges and the Fourth Criminal Charges) suggests otherwise. In relation to the First Criminal Charges, the Tribunal observes that Semovi filed its complaint four months before L1bre Holding submitted its Notice of Intent and six months before ESH filed its Notice of Intent.161 The Fourth Criminal Charges, also discussed at para. 127 above, concern a complaint that was filed by a[REDACED] one year before the Claimants\u2019 Memorial. The case moreover pertains to a business transaction dating back to 2014.162 As explained in *Pugachev v Russia, \"higher evidentiary burden may be required to prove the connection between the arbitration and measures already existing at the time of commencement of the arbitration.*163\n\nResponse, para. 65.\n\nApplication, para. 16; Response, para. 43.\n\n*Pugachev v. Russia,* para. 251 (**RL-0020**).\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent has clarified the circumstances under which the Mexican authorities ordered the arrest of Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. It is not implausible that they may have seen a \"*need for caution*\" under Article 141 of the Mexican National Code of Criminal Procedures.164 According to the information provided by the Respondent, [REDACED].165\n\nResponse, paras. 49, 54\n\nResponse, para. 49.\n\n132.\n\nMr. Zayas seems to have repeatedly failed to appear before Mexican judges.166 He had the opportunity to challenge the arrest warrants before domestic authorities, without success. Moreover, in the *amparo* proceedings initiated by Mr. Zayas, the Tenth Judge of the Criminal District noted that Mr. Zayas had justified his failure to appear before the court on a COVID-19 infection but had nonetheless travelled outside Mexico City. This led the Judge to revoke the suspension of an arrest warrant against Mr. Zayas.167 For his part, Mr. Le\u00f3n is still in the United States, where he has requested political asylum.168\n\nThe Respondent provides a chronological overview of the facts at para. 72 of the Response.\n\nAcuerdo del 27 de diciembre de 2021 dentro del Juicio de Amparo 729/2021 (**R-0021**), also discussed in the Response, para. 72.\n\nResponse, para. 58.\n\n133.\n\nMexico has put forward what appear to be plausible reasons for the Mexican authorities\u2019 decision to hold Mr. Zayas in custody and to seek the extradition of Mr. Le\u00f3n. It is not for a NAFTA tribunal to exercise judicial review of the decisions of domestic prosecutors, criminal courts, and other competent authorities in such matters. In this case, there is a plausible explanation for Mexican authorities\u2019 decision to hold Mr. Zayas in custody and to seek the extradition of Mr. Le\u00f3n. There is not sufficient evidence that the said criminal actions were initiated as a retaliation for this Arbitration or are intended to jeopardize the arbitral proceedings. Neither is it established that the criminal actions and arrest warrants against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n would seek to influence their testimony in the Arbitration.\n\n134.\n\nAs to the necessity of the measures sought, in *Ipek v. Turkey* the Tribunal held that interim measures must be \"*urgently necessary to ensure a fair trial of the claims that are before it*.\"169 In other words, they must be indispensable to prevent irreparable harm,170 in the sense of *\"harm that cannot be repaired by an award of damages\"*171 Tribunals have found that this standard is met where precautionary measures are required to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.172 In *PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* the Tribunal explained that \"*the party requesting provisional measures must demonstrate that, if the requested measures are not granted, there is a material risk of serious or irreparable injury.*\"173 Whether or not a specific measure satisfies the necessity requirement depends on the specific circumstances of the case. As noted by the *PNG* Tribunal:\n\n*The degree of \"gravity\" or \"seriousness\" of harm that is necessary for an order of provisional relief cannot be specified with precision and depends in part on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the relief requested and the relative harm to be suffered by each party* [...].174\n\n*Ipek v. Turkey,* para. 41 (**CL-0119**).\n\nCf. *Quiborax v. Bolivia* (**CL-0121**).\n\n*Id.*, para. 156.\n\n*Id.*, para. 157.\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, 21 January 2015 (hereinafter *PNG v. Papua New Guinea),* para. 109 (**RL-0017**).\n\n*Id*.\n\n135.\n\nIn the present case, the evidence is insufficient to establish a risk of irreparable harm arising from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n, the arrest warrant against Mr. Le\u00f3n, and the imprisonment of Mr. Zayas. It has not been established that pending criminal proceedings would preclude them from providing testimony in the Arbitration. Referring to the situation of Mr. Zayas, who remains in prison, Mexico explained:\n\n*[T]here is no legal impediment whatsoever for members of Hogan Lovells, Freshfields and Mr. Zayas' defense attorneys (made up of members of the law firm Cantoral C\u00e1rdenas Abogados) to visit Mr. Zayas in prison so that they provide information related to the arbitration; assist him in the preparation of a second witness statement and appear via videoconference in case he is called to the hearing*.175\n\nResponse, para. 148. *See also* Response, paras. 9, 10.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal has no reason to question such a statement, yet it intends to emphasize that Mexico is under the obligation to ensure that, despite the criminal actions launched against them, Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n will be able to provide uninhibited testimony before this Tribunal without any fear of adverse consequences. Accordingly, as long as Mr. Zayas remains in custody, Mexico shall ensure his physical integrity and guarantee that the Claimants\u2019 counsel can meet and work with him in a confidential setting. The Tribunal will also invite Mexico to take steps to ensure that the actions against Mr. Le\u00f3n do not turn into an obstacle to the arbitral proceedings, for instance by considering in good faith deferring any further proceedings to seek Mr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s extradition until the award has been issued. The Tribunal will consequently issue a formal recommendation that the Respondent acts accordingly.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to go further. In the absence of a clear and proven risk to the integrity of the arbitration proceedings, the measures sought are not urgently necessary. The timing of the Application for Provisional Measures confirms this impression.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, the fact that the measures would affect in some cases the rights of third parties and, in any case, the ability of Mexico to investigate and prosecute crimes allegedly committed within its jurisdiction cannot be ignored from the point of view of proportionality. As stated by the tribunal in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan II:*\n\n*[T]he requested measures be 'appropriate\u2019 in the circumstances of the individual case to achieve their purpose. This includes a balancing of the Parties\u2019 respective interests at stake. The fact that the Respondent is a State is relevant in this regard. [...] this Tribunal must be mindful when issuing provisional measures not to unduly encroach on the State\u2019s sovereignty and activities serving public interests.*176\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP & Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures, 4 December 2014 (hereinafter *Caratube v. Kazakhstan II),* para. 121 (**RL-0016**).\n\n139.\n\nProportionality is a high bar when it comes to the State\u2019s criminal jurisdiction. As noted by the tribunal in *EuroGas v Slovak Republic, \"the right and duty to conduct criminal prosecutions is a prerogative of any sovereign State and that only exceptional circumstances may therefore justify that an arbitral tribunal order provisional measures which interfere with criminal proceedings*.177\n\n*EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Procedural Order No. 3, 23 June 2015 (hereinafter *EuroGas v. Slovak Republic*), para. 77 (**RL-0021**).\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimants have requested provisional measures also in respect of future criminal actions that might be brought against them. In view of the situation as it is today, it would be disproportionate to prohibit the future initiation of criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. Witnesses in ICSID proceedings enjoy no immunity from criminal jurisdiction *per se* and creating such immunity, albeit temporarily, would fail to properly heed Mexico\u2019s criminal jurisdiction.\n\n**B. O****ther** **P****rovisional** **M****easures** **R****equested by the** **C****laimants**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe second group of provisional measures does not specifically refer to Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n. The Claimants request this Tribunal to: (i) require Mexico to refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings otherwise relating to the present Arbitration or the Concession; (ii) require Mexico to suspend and/or refrain from initiating any legal proceedings in which it seeks the determination of issues by the Mexican courts that fall to be determined exclusively in the present Arbitration (including, without limitation, with respect to the validity of the Concession); (iii) require Mexico to refrain from engaging in any other course of action that might aggravate the dispute between the parties or jeopardize the procedural integrity of this Arbitration; and (iv) grant any further or alternative interim relief that the Tribunal considers just and appropriate.178\n\nApplication, paras. 21, 132.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the request to require Mexico \"*to refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings [...] otherwise relating to the present Arbitration or the Concession\"*.179 This request cannot be granted in the absence of any evidence of a specific risk or urgent necessity for such a broad provisional measure. As noted by the tribunal in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan II,* cited above,180 the Tribunal *\"must be mindful when issuing provisional measures not to unduly encroach on the State\u2019s sovereignty and activities serving public interests*\".181 This Tribunal has found no sufficient evidence that Mexico might be using criminal investigations as a reprisal for this Arbitration or to intimidate witnesses. Neither can it be assumed that the Respondent would do so in future.\n\nApplication, paras. 21(e), 132(e).\n\n*See* para. 138 *supra*.\n\n*Caratube v. Kazakhstan II,* para. 121 (**RL-0016**).\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimants also request this Tribunal to order Mexico to suspend or refrain from initiating any legal proceedings seeking that domestic courts determine issues falling under the present Arbitration, such as the validity of the Concession. This raises two questions.\n\n144.\n\nThe first is whether the Tribunal should order Mexico to refrain from initiating any legal proceedings in some way related to issues falling under the present arbitration proceedings. This measure would be clearly disproportionate, and the alleged risk is far from established.\n\n145.\n\nThe second question is whether this Tribunal should order Mexico to suspend already existent legal proceedings involving the validity of the Concession. According to the Claimants, the First, Second, and Third Criminal Charges are related to the Concession.182 The Tribunal observes that, while some of these proceedings involve Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n, others do not (e.g. the Second Criminal Charges).\n\nReply, para. 12.\n\n146.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether legal proceedings allegedly involving the validity of the Concession pose a risk to the integrity of this Arbitration and the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings. The existence of such a risk has not been conclusively demonstrated. The mere fact that domestic criminal cases have some relation to the factual matrix of the case is insufficient to justify ordering them stayed. As noted by the tribunal in *Lao Holdings v. Laos:*\n\n*The ICSID Convention extends only to investment disputes. [...] Issues of such criminal liability by definition fall outside the scope of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT imposes a prohibition on a State that enjoins it from exercising criminal jurisdiction over such matters. [...] The Tribunal rejects any suggestion that ordinary domestic criminal law of general application was intended to be or is constrained by the initiation of ICSID proceedings under the BIT. As expressed by the Respondent, \"an arbitration clause is not a license for general lawlessness\"*.183\n\n*Lao Holdings v. Laos,* para. 21 (**CL-0123**).\n\n147.\n\nUnder truly extraordinary circumstances ICSID tribunals may issue provisional measures restricting the sovereign right of a State to investigate crimes within its jurisdiction, as would be the case of criminal proceedings launched with the sole or main purpose of unduly collecting evidence for the arbitration.184 The Application was unable to meet this high threshold. Mexico has offered reasonable explanations for the initiation of the criminal actions.\n\nCf. *Lao Holdings v. Laos,* paras. 26 ff (**CL-0123**).\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal has already addressed the First Criminal Charges, which [REDACED], concluding that it has not been established that they constitute a coordinated manoeuvre to interfere with the NAFTA proceedings.185 As to the Second Criminal Charges, [REDACED].186 It is not clear to the Tribunal how these charges would pose a risk to the integrity of this Arbitration, as they involve persons that are not participating in the arbitral proceedings. The Tribunal takes note of the Respondent\u2019s statement that the charged Semovi officials have not yet even been called to provide testimony in this Arbitration.187\n\n*See* para. 130 above.\n\nApplication, paras. 11, 51.\n\nResponse, para. 83.\n\n149.\n\nAs to the Third Criminal Charges, the Claimants submit that this investigation involves [REDACED].188 The Respondent submits that the proceedings do not actually involve Mr. Zayas and Mr. Le\u00f3n.189 Irrespective of Mr. Zayas\u2019 and Mr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s involvement, the Tribunal sees no overwhelming evidence that the Third Criminal Charges were actually launched to interfere with the Arbitration.\n\nApplication, paras. 11, 52.\n\nResponse, para. 103.\n\n150.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the First, Second, and Third Criminal Charges [REDACED] However, the parties, the legal basis, and the issues in those cases do not appear to be the same as in the Arbitration. They refer to the alleged criminal liability of individuals and not to the international responsibility for a breach of NAFTA, if any. Moreover, this Tribunal would not be bound by any finding the Mexican authorities could reach as to the validity of the Concession and may thus conduct its own, independent assessment of the facts and the law. The Tribunal therefore sees no need for the suspension of such proceedings.\n\n151.\n\nWhile an examination of further requirements would be unnecessary in the light of this finding, the Tribunal wishes to underscore that the measures required by the Claimants are hardly proportionate by any measurement. They would affect the legal situation of third parties and curtail Mexico\u2019s ability to investigate and prosecute crimes allegedly committed in areas under its jurisdiction. Great caution is mandatory before ordering provisional measures that could encroach the State\u2019s sovereign right to exercise criminal jurisdiction in its own territory.191 Generally phrased, possible risks to the integrity of the arbitral proceedings or to the exclusivity of ICSID jurisdiction do not suffice. The Tribunal is not in a position to grant the interim relief sought by the Claimants.\n\nCf. *Caratube v. Kazakhstan II,* para. 121 (**RL-0016**).\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine whether it should require Mexico to refrain from engaging in any other course of action that might aggravate the dispute between the Parties or jeopardize the procedural integrity of this Arbitration. There is no clear evidence that Mexico is currently attempting to jeopardize the proceedings or taking actions that could aggravate the dispute. As explained above, Mexico has offered plausible explanations and the Tribunal sees no urgent need to issue any blank provisional order against Mexico, which is anyway under a strict duty to act in good faith in the proceedings.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants have also requested the Tribunal to grant any further or alternative interim relief that the Tribunal considers just and appropriate.192 The Claimants have not provided evidence warranting any further provisional measures. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no need to grant any further interim relief at the current stage of the proceedings.\n\nApplication, paras. 21, 132.\n\nC. **C****osts**\n----------------\n\n154.\n\nFinally, the Claimants request the Tribunal to require Mexico to cover the costs associated with the Application.193 The Respondent has also requested the Tribunal to compensate Mexico for the costs and expenses incurred during this procedural stage.194 The Tribunal will consider the allocation of costs in its final decision in this Arbitration.\n\n*Id*.\n\nResponse, para. 166.\n\n**D. P****reservation of** **R****ights**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent has requested the Tribunal to safeguard its right to refute factual and legal arguments submitted by the Claimants in connection with the Application for Provisional Measures.195 The Tribunal clarifies that this decision is made on the basis of the evidence submitted by the Parties as of the date of this decision and considering the situation of fact, as it stands at the moment. This Procedural Order does not preclude the Parties from seeking interim relief in the future, should the circumstances change.\n\nResponse, para. 166 (iii).\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n156.\n\nFor the reasons set out above:\n\na. The Tribunal **REJECTS** the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, subject to hereunder at (b).\n\nb. In the interest of maintaining the integrity of the Arbitration, the Tribunal (i) formally invites the Respondent to consider in good faith deferring any further proceedings to seek Mr. Santiago Le\u00f3n Aveleyra\u2019s extradition until the award has been issued; and (b) expects the Respondent to take all appropriate steps to ensure that Mr. Eduardo Zayas Due\u00f1as\u2019 freedom of movement is not unduly restrained and that he will be able to meet with counsel and render testimony not only in conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced, but without any fear that may affect his free testimony.\n\nc.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn March 17, 2022, the Claimants submitted an application for provisional measures in which they sought urgent protection from criminal actions brought by Mexico in relation to this Arbitration and involving the Claimants' representatives and fact witnesses in this proceeding, Mr. Eduardo Zayas Due\u00f1as and Mr. Santiago Le\u00f3n Averleyra (the \"**Application**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn April 25, 2022, the Respondent submitted its response on the Application in which it objected to the provisional measures sought by the Claimants.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 5, 2022, the Claimants submitted their reply on the Application, and on 16 May 2022 the Respondent submitted its rejoinder on the Application.\n\n4.\n\nOn June 3, 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the Claimants' Application. In its Order, the Tribunal rejected the Claimants' Application subject to the following:\n\n*In the interest of maintaining the integrity of the Arbitration, the Tribunal (i) formally invites the Respondent to consider in good faith deferring any further proceedings to seek Mr. Santiago Le\u00f3n Aveleyra's extradition until the award has been issued; and (b) expects the Respondent to take all appropriate steps to ensure that Mr. Eduardo Zayas Due\u00f1as' freedom of movement is not unduly restrained and that he will be able to meet with counsel and render testimony not only in conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced, but without any fear that may affect his free testimony.*1\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 156(b).\n\n5.\n\nOn September 9, 2022, the Claimants submitted an emergency motion for access to Mr. Zayas together with Exhibits A through G (the \"**Emergency Motion**\"). On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Emergency Motion by September 13, 2022.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 13, 2022, the Respondent requested a one-day extension to respond to the Emergency Motion, which the Tribunal granted on the same day.\n\n7.\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the Respondent filed its Response on the Emergency Motion together with Exhibits 1 through 11.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, the Claimants sought leave to reply to the Response by September 19, 2022. On the same day, the Respondent sought permission to file a Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion in the event the Claimants' request was granted. On the same day, the Tribunal granted the Parties' respective requests and instructed the Respondent to file its Rejoinder by Friday, September 23, 2022.\n\n9.\n\nOn September 19, 2022, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Emergency Motion together with Exhibits A through E.\n\n10.\n\nOn September 23, 2022, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion together with Exhibits 12 and 13.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimants****' P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal order Mexico to transfer Mr. Zayas from the \"*Reclusorio Preventivo Varonil Sur*\" prison facility (the \"**Reclusorio Sur**\") to house arrest in Mexico City until the filing of the Claimants' Reply.2 According to the Claimants, this measure is the only remedy available that will guarantee the type of access to Mr. Zayas ordered by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3 and protect the Claimants' due process rights.3 In their Reply, the Claimants further request that \"pending Mr. Zayas' transfer to house arrest [\u2026] [he] be transferred to Hogan Lovells' Mexico City office periodically on those dates Claimants require (within 24 hours notice), under the requisite safeguards reasonably required by prison personnel so that Mr. Zayas may meet with Claimants' representatives and their counsel.\"4\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 1.\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 1; Reply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 3.\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 3.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the decisions on provisional measures in *Ipek Investment Limited v. Republic of Turkey, Hydro Srl. & Ors. v. Republic of Albania and Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia* to argue that the Tribunal has authority to grant the remedy they seek in their Emergency Motion.5 Further, they state that the remedy of transferring Mr. Zayas to house arrest would not be \"uncommon or extraordinary.\"6\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 3 citing to *Ipek Investment Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/18, Procedural Order No. 5, September 19, 2019; *Hydro Srl. & Ors. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016; *Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, February 26, 2010.\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 3.\n\n13.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, they have been unable to meet with Mr. Zayas under conditions similar to the ones Mr. Zayas would have normally experienced if he were not in pre-trial detention.7 They state that since the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3 they have made several good-faith attempts to obtain access to Mr. Zayas. However, Mexico has frustrated their efforts by providing \"vague, contradictory responses, and repeatedly changing its position regarding who, and how, Claimants could have potentially have access to Mr. Zayas\", leaving the Claimants no choice but to seek relief from the Tribunal.8\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 1.\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, pp. 1-2.\n\n14.\n\nMexico's failure to comply with the Tribunal's orders, they say, has \"significantly prejudiced Claimants' ability to prosecute their claims and respond to Mexico's Response Memorial.\"9 In this regard, they note that Mr. Zayas plays a critical role in the dispute and that the Claimants and their representatives need confidential, uninterrupted access to Mr. Zayas in order to obtain further testimony and evidence from him to rebut Mexico's allegations.10\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 1.\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, pp. 1-2.\n\n15.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, when they first requested access to Mr. Zayas Mexico responded that it would facilitate access but that the Claimants had failed to undertake the required steps to request it.11 In light of this response, the Claimants, through Mr. Zayas' Mexican criminal counsel, Mr. C\u00e9sar Cantoral, petitioned the Director of the Reclusorio Sur that the Claimants' counsel be allowed to meet with Mr. Zayas under the conditions that: (i) any of the Claimants' attorneys, paralegals, and experts be allowed to visit Mr. Zayas during multiple days and weeks; (ii) the Reclusorio Sur provide a private working area without any cameras or other electronic devices that may comprise the confidentiality of the meetings; (iii) the Claimants be allowed to bring electronic devices, including computers, cameras and audio recording equipment; and (iv) Mexico ensure that it will not tamper with any electronic devices and that it guarantee the confidentiality of all information discussed with Mr. Zayas.12\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 2.\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 3; Reply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 2.\n\n16.\n\nHowever, the Reclusorio Sur rejected the Claimants' request and informed them that only Mr. C\u00e9sar Cantoral was allowed to meet with Mr. Zayas under continuous supervision of prison personnel. Furthermore, Mr. Cantoral would be prohibited from bringing any communication equipment or device that could be used to store information.13 According to the Claimants, these conditions fall short of the conditions that Mr. Zayas would have normally experienced given that in normal circumstances the Claimants' legal representatives would have unfettered, confidential access to their witness with no prison personnel observing every move and no restrictions on the number of people who can visit or the devices that can be brought.14\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 3; Reply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 2.\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 4.\n\n17.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants note that in its Response to the Emergency Motion Mexico now appears to be stating that the Claimants' counsel, not just Mr. Cantoral, may have access to Mr. Zayas.15 They posit that this access, which has not been confirmed by the Reclusorio Sur, is still subject to unreasonable restrictions, such as the prohibition to use internet and any other electronic or communications devices besides a laptop.16 According to the Claimants, these limitation are still prejudicial to them and inconsistent with the Tribunal's orders.17\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 2.\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 2.\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, pp. 2-3.\n\n**B. T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Emergency Motion and invite the Claimants to comply with the conditions provided for under the relevant laws and regulations to access Mr. Zayas.18\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p. 11. In its Response, the Respondent also requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to abstain from sharing inter-partes communications with the Tribunal (*see* Response to the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 10-11); Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 7.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal is not competent to grant the Emergency Motion because the Tribunal is not a national criminal court or authority. In particular, \"[e]*l Tribunal no es la instancia competente para que las Demandantes soliciten la suspensi\u00f3n o modificaci\u00f3n de una medida [de] seguridad que fue impuesta al Sr. Zayas por un juez local en un procedimiento nacional ajeno a este arbitraje*. \"19\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 3.\n\n20.\n\nAs to the case law cited by the Claimants in support of their position that the Tribunal has authority to grant the Emergency Motion, the Respondent argues that these cases only confirm the Tribunal's lack of competence.20 Further, relying on the decision in *Pugachev. v. Russia*, the Respondent posits that the standard for the Tribunal to adopt a measure affecting a national criminal proceeding is a high one as it impinges on the Respondent's sovereign right and duty to investigate and prosecute crime.21\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 5.\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 5 citing to *Hydro Srl. & Ors. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016.\n\n21.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that the Emergency Motion seeks to improperly broaden the scope of Procedural Order No. 3, and that such an attempt ought to be accompanied by a request by the Claimants that meets the requirements for the Tribunal to grant provisional measures and by sufficient evidence on the existence of a threat attributable to the Respondent.22 The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to show that Mexico has prevented Mr. Zayas from meeting with his legal representatives or giving testimony in this proceeding, or that the conditions imposed to access Mr. Zayas are unreasonable.23\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 6.\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 7.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent states that it has undertaken the required steps to comply with Procedural Order No. 3. According to the Respondent, once the Order was issued its legal representatives in this proceeding liaised with the relevant authorities in order to grant access to Mr. Zayas and suspend the arrest warrant issued against Mr. Le\u00f3n.24\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 1-2; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 3-4.\n\n23.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants waited over two months since the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3 to contact the Respondent and ask for access to Mr. Zayas.25 According to the Respondent, instead of following the required procedures the Claimants sought to access Mr. Zayas under certain conditions, which are \"*poco convencionales que rebasan cualquier medida razonable que una autoridad penitenciaria \u2013 ya sea en M\u00e9xico o en cualquier otro Estado \u2013 podr\u00eda realizar*.\"26\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p. 2.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p 4.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Procedural Order No. 3 did not imply that Mr. Zayas ought to receive a preferential treatment or that the prison's security protocols should be disregarded.27\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 7.\n\n25.\n\nThus, the Respondent submits that the Claimants' counsel may meet with Mr. Zayas in accordance with the applicable rules on visitation and security protocols provided for under Mexican law. In this regard, the Respondent notes that the applicable rules provide for specific visitation hours and provisions on the place where the meetings ought to take place as well as the type of devices that can be brought to the visits.28 According to the Respondent, these conditions are reasonable. For instance, the fact that the visits ought to occur at specific times is a measure that ensures the safety of visitors and prison personnel.29 Further, the rules provide that laptops are allowed although with no internet access, and that prison personnel be informed of the devices that will be used as well as their purpose so that the pertinent security protocols may be conducted.30 The applicable rules also preserve the privacy of the meetings between detainees and their legal representatives, and the confidentiality of these meetings as well as of the documents brought in and out of prison.31\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 5-6.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p. 5.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p. 8.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 4-5; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 2-3, 7-8.\n\n26.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these requirements are no different than the ones applicable to prisons in the United States, which, in some instances, are even more onerous than the ones imposed by the Reclusorio Sur.32\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 6-7.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent invites the Claimants' counsel to send a communication to the *Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad Ciudadana* (\"SCC\")33 in which they (i) specify the individuals who seek authorization to meet with Mr. Zayas, accredit their position as legal representatives of Mr. Zayas in the criminal proceedings and/or the arbitral proceeding, and describe their involvement in his defense; (ii) indicate the days and times they intend to meet with Mr. Zayas within the established visiting hours, which are every day from 9 am to 5 pm; and (iv) indicate the number of devices (without internet) they intend to bring to the meeting and their technical characteristics (e.g., brand, model, serial number).34 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent further notes that certain arrangements can be made to ensure that the transit of people in the visiting area does not affect the meetings between Mr. Zayas and the Claimants' counsel. This measure, the Respondent says, \"*son una muestra de buena fe de la Demandada y de sus autoridades penitenciarias para dar cumplimiento a la RP3 sin afectar la gobernabilidad del sistema penitenciario*.\"35\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent specifies that the persons of contact are: Lic. Enrique Serrano Flores, *Subsecretario de Sistema Penitenciario, Subsecretar\u00eda de Sistema Penitenciario, Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad Ciudadana*; and Dr. \u00d3scar Le\u00f3n Catillo, *Director Ejecutivo de Asuntos Penitenciarios, Subsecretaria de Asuntos Penitenciarios, Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad Ciudadana* (Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, note 6).\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p. 11; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 4-5.\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 4.\n\n**III. CONSIDERATIONS**\n-----------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling, as it did in Procedural Order No. 3, its power to order or recommend provisional measures under Article 1134 NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Rules of Arbitration.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants have requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to transfer Mr. Zayas to house arrest in Mexico City, arguing that this is the \"only\" alternative to ensure that the Claimants' counsel have access to Mr. Zayas for the purposes of his witness statement.36 According to the Claimants, the conditions offered by the Reclusorio Sur do not satisfy the standard set under Procedural Order No. 3.37 Pending transfer to house arrest, they further request the Tribunal to order the Respondent to transfer Mr. Zayas to the offices of Hogan Lovells in Mexico City on the dates the Claimants require.38\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, p. 1; Reply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 3.\n\nEmergency Motion, September 9, 2022, pp. 3-4.\n\nReply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, p. 3.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has made all the necessary efforts to comply with Procedural Order No. 3, while the Claimants have not carried out the necessary steps to meet with Mr. Zayas for the taking of his witness statement and have moreover waited considerable time to seek access to Mr. Zayas.39 According to the Respondent, both the Claimants' counsel in this arbitration and Mr. Cantoral (Mr. Zayas' Mexican criminal counsel) are allowed to access Mr. Zayas at the Reclusorio Sur facilities, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., 365 days a year.40 The Respondent further asserts that the conditions at the Reclusorio Sur facilities guarantee the confidentiality of the interactions between Mr. Zayas and his counsel, as well as of the documents and electronic devices used by counsel.41 According to Mexico, the facilities have similar standards as those of other jurisdictions.42\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 2-4; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 1ff.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, p. 5; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 5.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 4 ff.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 7-8.\n\n31.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal recalled that the Mexican authorities have the duty to investigate crimes committed in areas under their jurisdiction.43 However the Tribunal must exercise restrain when it comes to provisional measures affecting third parties.44 It does not behove the Arbitral Tribunal to opine as to the Mexican authorities' decision to hold Mr. Zayas in custody pending criminal proceedings. This Tribunal is however concerned with the situation of Mr. Zayas, as far as it may affect his ability to render testimony in the arbitral proceedings.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 128.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 128.\n\n32.\n\nThe measure sought by the Claimants would clearly entail a significant interference with the Mexican criminal justice system in a criminal investigation involving third parties and with a complaint already active before the arbitration was initiated.45 The Claimants must therefore meet a high threshold to satisfy this Tribunal that the measure requested is both necessary and reasonable.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, paras. 127, 130.\n\n33.\n\nWhile undoubtedly reasonable, transferring Mr. Zayas to house arrest may not be necessarily the \"only\" option to take his witness statement under fair conditions. The same applies to the need to transfer Mr. Zayas to the offices of Hogan Lovells in Mexico City for the purposes of his testimony. On balance, and not without some hesitation, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion \u2013 as it is bound to in view of the comity to which the Respondent is entitled as a state \u2013 that the assurances given by the Respondent in its submissions suggest that it is willing to provide the Claimants with reasonable opportunities to meet with Mr. Zayas.46 The Tribunal has no reason to question Mexico's willingness to abide by its assurances.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 4-8; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 4-5.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal underlines that Procedural Order No. 3 indicates that Mr. Zayas shall *\"be able to meet with counsel and render testimony not only in* ***conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced****, but without any fear that may affect his free testimony*.\"47 The Tribunal was mindful then and is mindful now that the conditions of a detainee cannot be \"identical\" to those of a free person. Procedural Order No. 3 referred, therefore, to \"similar\" rather than \"identical\" conditions. Mexico is, however, under a strict obligation to ensure that Mr. Zayas is in a position to render entirely free testimony, without any fear that his witness statement may have consequences for him.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 165(b) (emphasis added).\n\n35.\n\nConsidering the assurances offered by the Respondent in its latest submissions,48 the Tribunal trusts that the Respondent will guarantee that the Claimants' counsel team has the necessary clearance to access Mr. Zayas freely, with the equipment necessary to receive testimony, for him to freely and safely deliver his witness statement under strict confidentiality despite him being in detention.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 4-8; Rejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 4-5.\n\n36.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal invites Mexico to guarantee that the taking of Mr. Zayas' witness statement meets at least all the following minimum requirements:\n\n(a) A reasonable number of members of the Claimants' team of counsel (including experts) must be granted reasonably swift access to Mr. Zayas at the Reclusorio Sur facilities. Based on the Respondent's assurances, the Tribunal understands that access will be available 365 days a year from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Mexico City Time). The Claimants must meet reasonable requirements for accessing the facilities. Such reasonable requirements include: (i) the identification of each member of its counsel team whose presence will be required at the meetings with Mr. Zayas; and (ii) the need to inform the Respondent prior to each meeting with sufficient anticipation, which shall not exceed 24 hours.\n\n(b) The Claimants' counsel team must be able to enter the Reclusorio Sur facilities with the electronic devices for the recording and storage of information that are necessary to take Mr. Zayas' witness statement. The Claimants must comply with reasonable formal requirements for introducing such devices into the facility. The Tribunal understands that the Claimants will be required to provide a list identifying the electronic devices with sufficient anticipation, which shall not exceed 24 hours.\n\n(c) The Respondent must guarantee that the electronic devices and the hard copy documents used by the Claimants' counsel at the Reclusorio Sur, as well as any information or storage contained therein, remain confidential and are not subject to any tampering, bugging, reproduction or inspection from prison personnel at the Reclusorio Sur nor by any member or representative of the Respondent.\n\n(d) The Respondent must guarantee the confidentiality of all the meetings held between Mr. Zayas and the Claimants' counsel. No visual or audio recordings of the meetings shall be taken by personnel of the Reclusorio Sur or the Respondent.\n\nThis means that only visual surveillance (without recording) of the meetings, through a video-camera without audio recording, is allowed. The video-camera must be set in a position that avoids any observation by any means of the conversations and/or the information recorded and/or exchanged between the Claimants' counsel and Mr. Zayas. The Respondent must ensure that the conditions of the surveillance do not violate the confidentiality of the meetings and give the Claimants' counsel access to the surveillance room if asked to do so.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in its Rejoinder of September 23, 2022, the Respondent complained that the Claimants are sharing communications between the Parties with the Tribunal.49 For the Respondent, this practice is contrary to para. 12.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.50 The Respondent requests the Tribunal \"*que ordene a las Demandantes cumplir con el \u00b6 12.3 de la RP1 y se abstengan de compartir con el Tribunal comunicaciones intercambiadas por las partes, lo cual es necesario para contar con un procedimiento arbitral ordenado, eficiente y evitar disrupciones procesales*.\"51 The Tribunal reiterates that, as established in Procedural Order No. 1, the Secretary of the Tribunal should not be copied in communications between the Parties when such communications are not intended to be transmitted to the Tribunal.52\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, p. 10.\n\nRejoinder on the Emergency Motion, September 23, 2022, pp. 10-11.\n\nResponse on the Emergency Motion, September 14, 2022, pp. 10-11.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, para. 12.3.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n38.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal:\n\n1. **Dismisses** the Claimants' **Emergency Motion** of September 9, 2022.\n\n2. **Orders** the Respondent to ensure that Mr. Zayas be able to meet with the Claimants' team of counsel and render testimony not only in conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced, but without any fear that may affect his free testimony, in the terms specified in para. 36 above.\n\nDate: September 29, 2022"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 8", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-11-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 8\n----------------------\n\n**I.

In its Order, the Tribunal (i) rejected the Claimants' Application, (ii) invited the Respondent to consider in good faith deferring any further proceedings to seek Mr. Santiago Le\u00f3n Aveleyra's extradition until the award in this case has been issued, and (iii) noted that it expects the Respondent to take all appropriate steps to ensure that Mr. Zayas' freedom of movement is not unduly restrained and that he will be able to meet with counsel and render testimony not only in conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced, but without any fear that may affect his free testimony.1\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 156(b).\n\n5.\n\nOn September 9, 2022, the Claimants submitted an emergency motion for access to Mr. Zayas together with Exhibits A through G (the \"**Emergency Motion**\"). On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the motion by September 13, 2022.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 13, 2022, the Respondent requested a one-day extension to respond to the Emergency Motion, which the Tribunal granted on the same day.\n\n7.\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the Respondent filed its response on the Emergency Motion together with Exhibits 1 through 11.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, the Claimants sought leave to reply to the response by September 19, 2022.

The Order dismissed the Claimants' Emergency Motion and ordered the Respondent \"to ensure that Mr. Zayas be able to meet with the Claimants' team of counsel and render testimony not only in conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced, but without any fear that may affect his free testimony [\u2026].\"2\n\nProcedural Order No. 7, para. 38.\n\n11.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, the Claimants filed a renewed emergency motion for access to Mr. Zayas together with Exhibits A through E (the \"**Renewed Motion**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn October 11, 2022, the Respondent filed its Response on the Claimants' Renewed Motion together with Annexes 1 and 2.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 11, 2022, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal providing an update on Mr. Zayas' situation.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 12, 2022, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants' communication of October 11 by Friday, October 14.\n\n15.\n\nOn October 12, 2022, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal seeking leave to reply to the Respondent's response.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 13, 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it considered that it had sufficient information and that, after reviewing the Parties' submissions, it would determine whether further submissions or a short virtual hearing were required.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 14, 2022, the Respondent submitted its response on the Claimants' communication of October 11.\n\n18.\n\nOn October 14, 2022, the Claimants provided a further update on Mr. Zayas' situation.\n\n19.\n\nOn October 17, 2022, the Tribunal scheduled a virtual hearing on the Renewed Motion on October 25, 2022, at 11 am (Washington, D.C. time).\n\n20.\n\nOn October 24, 2022, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal noting that they had asked the Respondent to \"provide a copy of the statement Mr. Eduardo Zayas was compelled to sign at the Reclusorio [S]ur on 11 October\" but that Mexico had refused, and requesting that this issue be discussed at the hearing.3 On the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that this matter may be addressed by the Parties within the time allocated to each one.\n\nThe Claimants' email to the Tribunal, October 24, 2022.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Tribunal and the Parties held a virtual hearing on the Renewed Motion.\n\n22.\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Claimants sought permission to submit the statement signed by Mr. Zayas to the Tribunal. On the same day, the Tribunal instructed the Claimants to explain by November 2, 2022 the subject matter of the statement and its relevance for this proceeding. The Tribunal further invited the Respondent to provide comments on the Claimants' explanation by November 4.\n\n23.\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal addressing the conditions for the Claimants' representatives to have access to Mr. Zayas.\n\n24.\n\nOn November 2, 2022, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit brief comments on the Respondent's communication of November 1 by November 4.\n\n25.\n\nOn November 2, 2022, the Claimants submitted their explanation as to the relevance of the statement signed by Mr. Zayas. On November 4, 2022, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants' communication.\n\n26.\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the Claimants confirmed that they had already responded to the Respondent's November 1 communication in their November 2 submission.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimants****' P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants file their Renewed Motion due to \"Mexico's continued failure to provide Claimants' counsel with access to Mr. Eduardo Zayas as mandated by Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 7.\"4\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 1.\n\n28.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants submit that Mexico has failed to honor its assurances that it would take all necessary steps to guarantee that the Claimants' representatives could meet with Mr. Zayas at the Reclusorio Preventivo Varonil Sur (\"**Reclusorio Sur**\") under conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced and without fear that may affect his free testimony.5\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 1.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants contend that while they complied with the Tribunal's and Mexico's instructions to gain access to Mr. Zayas, the Respondent failed to guarantee that the Claimants' representatives and Mr. Zayas could meet in a setting that allowed for a free, open, candid and confidential conversation.6\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, pp. 2-3, 5.\n\n30.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants submit that their meeting with Mr. Zayas took place in a small room that was located within the prison's administrative office, where prison officials and unrestrained prisoners were present, and which had paper-thin walls and contained open partitions as well as windows allowing anyone outside of the room to hear the communications taking place inside. Further, a prison guard was standing close to the door where he could look into the room and hear their conversation.7 According to the Claimants, under these conditions they were unable to prepare Mr. Zayas' witness declaration.8\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, pp. 3-4.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 5.\n\n31.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit that during their meeting with Mr. Zayas he \"made a number of additional concerning statements regarding his treatment and ability to speak freely\" and state that he had \"recently received threats against his physical integrity.\"9 According to the Claimants, Mr. Zayas represented to them that he felt unable to render testimony in a confidential setting.10\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, note 1; *see also* Hearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 22, ll 14-21, p. 46, ll 3-22, p. 47, ll 1-22, p. 48, ll 1-4.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 19, II 19-20.\n\n32.\n\nRelatedly, in their communications to the Tribunal of October 11 and October 14, 2022, the Claimants contend that Mr. Zayas was instructed to write a hand-written declaration stating that he has not been the subject of torture, violence or the like. According to the Claimants, \"Mr. Zayas signed the declaration under pressure and fearing for his physical integrity.\"11 The Claimants say that the Respondent has refused to provide a copy of this declaration.12\n\nThe Claimants' email to the Tribunal, October 11, 2022.\n\nThe Claimants' email to the Tribunal, October 24, 2022.\n\n33.\n\nFurther, the Claimants submit that the premise of Mr. Zayas incarceration during the pendency of the arbitration \"is increasingly suspect.\"13 They contend that the civil complaint against Mr. Zayas, which was the basis for the criminal case brought against him, had been recently voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff in that case, [REDACTED]14 They state that, despite [REDACTED] withdrawal, the Respondent has not halted its prosecution of Mr. Zayas and continues keeping him incarcerated.15\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 5.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, pp. 5-6.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 6.\n\n34.\n\nAs to the relief they seek, in their Renewed Motion the Claimants submit that the only viable option for the Claimants to prepare Mr. Zayas' declaration consistent with the Tribunal's orders is to transfer him regularly outside of prison for future meetings. This is not an extraordinary request, the Claimants say, given that prisoners are routinely moved from one facility to another, and the Respondent has allowed the transfer of prisoners to house arrest.16 In particular, in their Renewed Motion the Claimants request that:\n\n*Mr. Zayas be transferred to the Hogan Lovells' Mexico City office on any day requested, from the hours of 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM subject to providing 24 hours' notice, under requirements similar to those stated in Procedural Order No. 7, for as many days as reasonably necessary for Claimants to be able to meet with Mr. Zayas in order to work on his fact witness declaration and receive his input on Claimants' Reply Memorial*.17\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 5.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 6; *see also* the Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 1.\n\n35.\n\nIn their communication to the Tribunal of October 11, 2022, the Claimants seek the following relief:\n\n*(a) Claimants reiterate their request for the relief sought in their letter of 7 October 2022. Mr. Zayas can plainly not work on his declaration and assist Claimants in connection with their forthcoming Reply submission under the current conditions.*\n\n*(b) Claimants request the Tribunal to reconsider its ruling in Procedural Order No. 3 and requests the Tribunal to grant in full the relief Claimants initially sought in their Application for Provisional Measures of 17 March 2022. This is appropriate not only based on the above, but also considering also the latest developments regarding the withdrawal of the civil complaint that gave rise to the criminal action that Mexico used to put Mr. Zayas in pre-trial detention (the details of which are outlined in Claimants' 7 October 2022 letter).*\n\n*(c) Claimants request the Tribunal to enjoin Mexico from submitting into evidence for any purpose in this arbitration the declaration that they obtained from Mr. Zayas under duress. Insofar as Mexico files that declaration for any purpose in this arbitration, Claimants request that it be stricken.*18\n\nThe Claimants' email to the Tribunal, October 11, 2022.\n\n36.\n\nDuring the hearing of October 25, 2022, the Claimants submitted that, under the existing circumstances, transferring Mr. Zayas to the offices of Hogan Lovells is no longer an option and that ordering Respondent to transfer Mr. Zayas to house arrest is the only possible solution.19 Further, they contended that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over their Renewed Motion and noted that other tribunals have afforded the relief they seek.20\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 77, ll 8-19.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 24, ll 10-14, p. 48, ll 16-21.\n\n**B. T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Claimants' Renewed Motion be dismissed.21\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 7.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Mexican authorities have acted in good faith during this proceeding and have undertaken all necessary steps to guarantee that the Claimants could meet with Mr. Zayas under the conditions set forth by the Tribunal in Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 7.22 According to the Respondent, it has offered more flexible conditions by allowing the Claimants' representatives to bring electronic devices and exempting them from complying with the necessary registration requirements prior to the visit.23 The Respondent states that, to the contrary, the Claimants have refused to comply with the minimum security conditions which are required to meet with Mr. Zayas in the Reclusorio Sur.24\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 1.\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, pp. 1, 4; the Respondent's letter to the Tribunal, October 14, 2022, p. 2.\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 1.\n\n39.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that it took the Claimants' representatives three months after the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3 to formally request access to Mr. Zayas. Once the Claimants' representatives requested it, the Respondent says, its legal team took the necessary actions to ensure that the prison authorities granted them access in accordance with the conditions established in Procedural Order No. 7.25\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 2.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in light of the Claimants' Renewed Motion, the Respondent's legal team contacted the relevant prison authorities, who confirmed that (i) the Claimants' representatives were not denied access to the Reclusorio Sur, but were requested to comply with the required security measures; (ii) the Claimants' representatives were provided with a separate room to meet with Mr. Zayas to ensure a confidential setting without the presence of inmates or security personnel; and (iii) there were no security or administrative personnel accompanying the Claimants' representatives.26\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, pp. 2-3.\n\n41.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimants do not take into account that Mr. Zayas is an inmate, which requires that strict security standards are met in order to guarantee the safety within the prison facility.27 According to the Respondent, the Claimants seem to expect that Mr. Zayas is granted preferential treatment beyond what the laws and regulations governing Mexican prison authorities provide for.28\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 3; the Respondent's letter to the Tribunal, October 14, 2022, p. 1.\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 1.\n\n42.\n\nFurther, the Respondent notes that the Claimants' representatives acted \"*de [] forma abusiva*\", particularly by taking pictures inside of the prison facility without authorization, which they then submitted into the record in this proceeding.29 The Respondent contends that, in any event, the photos do not show the alleged presence of excessive security personnel, other inmates, video-cameras or any other element that could have interfered in the Claimants' representatives' conversation with Mr. Zayas.30\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 4.\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 5.\n\n43.\n\nAs to [REDACTED] withdrawal of her complaint against Mr. Zayas, the Respondent notes that [REDACTED] only withdrew the civil complaint, not the criminal suit against Mr. Zayas. The Respondent submits that, in any event, the Tribunal is not the competent authority to decide on the scope of [REDACTED] withdrawal.31\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 6; the Respondent's letter to the Tribunal, October 14, 2022, p. 3.\n\n44.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' communication of October 11, 2022, the Respondent submits that since March 2022 the Claimants have made grave accusations against Mexico concerning Mr. Zayas' health and that, as a result, the Respondent's legal team reached out to the relevant authorities to inquire about this issue. The authorities informed the Respondent's legal team that (i) Mr. Zayas is in good health and has not been threatened, and (ii) in light of the Claimants' accusations, prison personnel at the Reclusorio Sur requested that Mr. Zayas \"*manifestara su estado de salud por escrito*.\"32 The Respondent submits that it does not have a copy of this declaration, and that, in any event, the Respondent does not purport to submit it in this proceeding.33\n\nThe Respondent's letter to the Tribunal, October 14, 2022, p. 3.\n\n*Id*.\n\n45.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Respondent contended that this arbitration cannot be used to interfere with national criminal investigations initiated in relation to potential crimes involving an individual who is not a claimant in this arbitration and a victim who is not related to this proceeding.34 The Respondent argued that investment tribunals have repeatedly concluded that they are not competent to order provisional measures that may impinge on criminal investigations.35 Further, it contended that the Claimants' Renewed Motion (i) does not meet the standard of necessity because the criminal suit against Mr. Zayas is unrelated to this arbitration, and (ii) is not urgent considering that the Claimants' representatives waited months after the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3 before formally requesting access to Mr. Zayas.36 Moreover, it would be disproportionate to order the release of Mr. Zayas as this would interfere with the jurisdiction of the relevant \"*juez de control*.\"37\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (Spanish version), p. 42, ll 11-17, p. 46, ll 5-10.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (Spanish version), p. 44, ll 4-8.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (Spanish version), p. 43, ll 4-17.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (Spanish version), p. 44, ll 12-15.\n\n46.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submitted that Mr. Zayas' criminal counsel can resort to the competent authorities and the available mechanisms under Mexican law to safeguard Mr. Zayas' rights.38\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (Spanish version), p. 30, ll 16-17, p. 31, l 1.\n\n**III. CONSIDERATIONS**\n-----------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, as it did in Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 7, that it has the power to order or recommend provisional measures under Article 1134 NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Rules of Arbitration. This is the third time this Tribunal considers a request for provisional measures concerning the detention of Mr. Eduardo Zayas Due\u00f1as in Mexico.\n\n48.\n\nOn this occasion, the Claimants essentially request this Tribunal to reconsider its ruling in Procedural Order No. 3 and recommend that Mr. Zayas be granted house arrest.39 While the Claimants initially requested this Tribunal to order that Mr. Zayas \"*be transferred to the Hogan Lovells' Mexico City office on any day requested, from the hours of 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM subject to providing 24 hours' notice [\u2026] for as many days as reasonably necessary [\u2026]*\",40 they then submitted that transferring the witness to house arrest would be the only possible solution to the impossibility to obtain a free testimony from Mr. Zayas.41 During the hearing of October 25, 2022, the Claimants also referred to the need to order a stay of the criminal proceedings pending against Mr. Zayas.42\n\nThe Claimants' email to the Tribunal, October 11, 202; Hearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 77, ll 8-19.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, p. 6.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 77, ll 8-19.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), pp. 48, ll 21-22 and 64, ll 1-3.\n\n49.\n\nAs stated in Procedural Order No. 3, a request for provisional measures must meet several requirements: (i) *prima facie* jurisdiction and a *prima facie* case; (ii) necessity; (iii) proportionality, and (iv) urgency.43 In Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 7, the Tribunal found that these requirements were not completely met in the present case. The question now before the Tribunal is whether the events that occurred since the issuance of Procedural Order No. 7 justify revisiting the issue. Having examined the evidence submitted by the Parties and giving careful consideration to the arguments on both sides, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to satisfy the requirements for the requested provisional measure.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, June 3, 2022, para. 123.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants have invoked in favor of their applications for provisional measures the interim award in *Pugachev v. Russia*.44 The majority of the Tribunal does not see how the *Pugachev* decision would support the interim relief sought by the Claimants. It is worth recalling that the *Pugachev* tribunal denied a request for interim measures related to the protection of witnesses.45 It further denied the claimant's request to suspend criminal proceedings in Russia.46 The *Pugachev* Interim Award only granted a request to seek suspension of extradition proceedings in France in circumstances that substantially differ from the ones in this case as explained below.47\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017 (**RL-0020**). Cited, e.g., in the Claimants' Reply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, note 1.\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, paras. 336ff. (**RL-0020**).\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, paras. 275, 430 (**RL-0020**).\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, paras. 275, 430 (**RL-0020**).\n\n51.\n\nThe facts of this case are substantially different to the *Pugachev v. Russia* case. First, Mr. Pugachev was not a witness, as Mr. Zayas, but the claimant in the arbitration.48 Second, the commencement of criminal proceedings against Mr. Pugachev was clearly connected to the facts underlying his claim against the Russian Federation.49 Such factual connection is neither evident nor apparent in the case of Mr. Zayas. Third, the criminal proceedings against Mr. Pugachev were commenced on the initiative of organs of the Russian State.50 By contrast, the criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas were launched before the arbitration began as a response to a criminal complaint filed by a foreign third party unrelated to the Respondent. Fourth, the extradition of Mr. Pugachev was imminent, so that, there was an evident risk to his ability to appear in the hearings and present his case against Russia.51 In the case of Mr. Zayas the conditions to render testimony may not be ideal, precisely because he is in prison. Still, the evidence suggests that \u2013 with the cooperation and coordination of the Respondent, the Claimants' counsel, and Mr. Zayas' criminal attorney \u2013 Mr. Zayas will be able to render testimony under the conditions set by the Tribunal in Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 7.\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federatio*n, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, para. 1 (**RL-0020**).\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, paras. 266f., 331 (**RL-0020**).\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, paras. 266f. (**RL-0020**).\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, paras. 321ff. (**RL-0020**).\n\n52.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal further finds that the present case is also fundamentally different from *Hydro v. Albania*, where the arbitral tribunal, including one of the arbitrators in this case, recommended the respondent State to suspend criminal proceedings against Mr. Francesco Becchetti and Mr. Mauro De Renzis and to take all actions necessary to suspend extradition proceedings pending against them.52 In the majority view, there are two key differences between the *Hydro v. Albania* case and the facts before this Tribunal. First, Mr. Becchetti and Mr. De Renzis were claimants in the arbitral proceedings.53 This circumstance was essential to the *Hydro* Tribunal's decision to grant interim relief. The arbitrators underlined that \"*[t]he ability of the Claimants to effectively participate in this arbitration, specifically Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis is extremely important. Not only are they Claimants in their own right but they are intimately connected with the Corporate Claimants*.\"54 From the standpoint of the arbitral proceedings, the circumstances of Messrs. Becchetti and De Renzis are therefore not comparable to the situation of Mr. Zayas in the view of the majority of this Tribunal, who may be connected to the Claimants but is not a claimant in his own right, but only a witness. Second, as opposed to the present case, the criminal proceedings were closely related to the investment and, thus, to the factual matrix of the arbitration.55 This is not the case for the proceedings pending against Mr. Zayas, which are wholly unrelated to the NAFTA claim and revolve around third-party interests.\n\n*Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016, para. 5.1 (**CL-0120**). Cited, e.g., in the Claimants' Reply on the Emergency Motion, September 19, 2022, note 1 and in the Claimants' Application, March 17, 2022, para. 20.\n\n*Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016, para. 1.2.b (**CL-0120**).\n\n*Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016, para. 3.36 (**CL-0120**).\n\n*Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016, paras. 2.31 and 3.41 (**CL-0120**).\n\n53.\n\nThe present case is hence fundamentally different from other cases where arbitral tribunals have granted provisional measures concerning criminal proceedings. The majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants' Renewed Motion does not satisfy the standard formulated in past cases for granting the interim relief sought.\n\n54.\n\nAs regards *prima facie* jurisdiction, the arbitral tribunal in *Pugachev v. Russia* held that \"*Claimant must prove, not only that this Tribunal has prima facie jurisdiction over the general dispute, but also that it has prima facie jurisdiction for the requested interim measures.*\"56 In Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal noted that a request for provisional measures concerning criminal proceedings must meet a \"particularly high\" threshold.57 This holds especially true when the criminal complaint at stake involves third-party victims, in respect of which this Tribunal has no jurisdiction.58\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, July 7, 2017, para. 216 (**RL-0020**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, June 3, 2022, para. 122; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. The Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision regarding Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures, July 31, 2009, para. 137 (**RL-0022**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, June 3, 2022, paras. 127-128.\n\n55.\n\nThere is no doubt that the criminal proceedings that have resulted in Mr. Zayas' arrest were initiated due to a criminal complaint by a third party unrelated to the Mexican State. This factual setting has not changed. The Claimants submit that the third party withdrew the civil action against Mr. Zayas.59 However, the Respondent has stated, and the Claimants have not disputed, that the withdrawal of the civil action does not result in the termination or withdrawal of the criminal proceedings.60\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, pp. 5-6.\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, pp. 5-6; the Respondent's letter to the Tribunal, October 14, 2022, p. 3. Cf. also the Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, pp. 5-6.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the proceedings pending against Mr. Zayas bear no relation to the NAFTA claims of ES Holdings and L1bre Holding. The alleged criminal offences of Mr. Zayas are entirely divorced from the factual matrix of the NAFTA case. Against this background, even assuming that the criminal case against Mr. Zayas might cause some disruption in the conduct of the arbitration, it would be improper for this Tribunal to intervene in Mexico's exercise of its criminal jurisdiction. As expressed by the Tribunal in *Hydro v. Albania*:\n\n*[\u2026] [T]here may be situations where incarceration of a claimant would disrupt an arbitration but where it would be improper for the tribunal to intervene.****An example given by counsel is where a person is charged with a serious offence totally unrelated to the factual circumstances of the dispute being arbitrated****, such as murder. But that is not the situation here. The alleged offences here are not divorced from the investments made by the Claimants.*61\n\nEmphasis added. *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016, para. 3.19 (**CL-0120**).\n\n57.\n\nIn their repeated requests concerning Mr. Zayas' imprisonment, the Claimants have thus been unable to establish the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to grant a provisional measure granting Mr. Zayas house arrest, a measure that may not only interfere with the courts of Mexico in a case unrelated to the investment claim but affect the interests of persons that are not a party to this arbitration. This Tribunal has to adjudicate the investment claim under NAFTA. In the majority view, it cannot recommend provisional measures that overstep the authority of domestic criminal courts in criminal matters, along with the interests of a third-party victim who has no standing in this arbitration.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of the Claimants' allegations on the conditions of the prison where Mr. Zayas is being held and that he \"*recently received threats against his physical integrity.*\"62 However, Mr. Zayas is not a party to the present arbitration. Neither does counsel for the Claimants represent his interests. Accordingly, in the view of the majority of the Tribunal, concerns about Mr. Zayas' health and conditions of imprisonment should be raised by his attorney before competent domestic authorities. This arbitration is not the proper forum to address such concerns. If the conditions for house arrest under Mexican criminal law are met, as claimed by the Claimants, it is for Mr. Zayas' counsel to request to the proper Mexican courts the change in the conditions of imprisonment of Mr. Zayas. There is no evidence before this Tribunal that such a request has been made. What the Claimants are asking this Tribunal to do is to substitute counsel of Mr. Zayas for counsel for the Claimants and to substitute Mexican courts for this Tribunal and decide on matters related to the imprisonment of Mr. Zayas. Those are matters for a Mexican court to decide at the request of Mr. Zayas' criminal attorney.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, note 1; *see also* Hearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 22, ll 14-21, p. 46, ll 3-22, p. 47, ll 1-22, p. 48, ll 1-4.\n\n59.\n\nThe conditions of Mr. Zayas as an inmate, as submitted by the Claimants, merit the concern and empathy of this Tribunal. However, as expressed in Procedural Order No. 7, for the purposes of the present arbitration this Tribunal is concerned with the situation of Mr. Zayas only as far as it may prevent him from rendering testimony in the investment arbitration proceedings.63 The Tribunal has not been presented with any material evidence suggesting that Mr. Zayas is being specifically pressured to abstain from rendering testimony or to make an untruthful statement in these proceedings. Neither is there any evidence that Mr. Zayas' conditions of imprisonment are substantially different from those of other inmates. Even assuming the existence of differential treatment of Mr. Zayas in respect of other inmates, there is no evidence that the difference directly affects this arbitration. The Claimants' counsel representation that Mr. Zayas feels unable to render confidential testimony is insufficient in the opinion of the majority of the Tribunal.64 Representations about Mr. Zayas' sense of fear do not provide sufficient justification for a NAFTA Tribunal to recommend the transfer to house arrest of a witness who is in prison for reasons unrelated to the investment claim, due to criminal proceedings commenced prior to the initiation of the arbitral proceedings in response to a third-party complaint.\n\nProcedural Order No. 7, September 29, 2022, para. 31.\n\nHearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 19, ll 17-20.\n\n60.\n\nBesides *prima facie* jurisdiction, a party requesting provisional measures must satisfy the requirement of necessity. This requirement entails a high burden where interim measures affect criminal proceedings.65 In *Hydro v. Albania*, the Tribunal defined the threshold as one of absolute necessity:\n\n\"*[C]riminal law and procedure are a most obvious and undisputed part of State sovereignty. That (trite) fact supports the approach adopted here by the Tribunal, namely that any obstruction of the investigation or prosecution of conduct that is reasonably suspected to be criminal in nature should only be ordered where that is* ***absolutely necessary****.*\"66\n\nCf. Procedural Order No. 3, June 3, 2022, para. 134.\n\nEmphasis added. *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures, March 3, 2016, para. 3.16 (**CL-0120**).\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants must provide clear evidence of a risk of irreparable injury if the measures are not granted.67 While this Tribunal has required Mexico to ensure that Mr. Zayas be allowed to declare in \"*conditions similar to the ones he would have normally experienced*\"68, it has also acknowledged that the conditions of a detainee cannot be identical to those a person would experience in freedom.69\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, January 21, 2015, para. 109 (**RL-0017**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, June 3, 2022, para. 165(b).\n\nProcedural Order No. 7, September 29, 2022, para. 34.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants' request for reconsideration is not motivated by an absolute lack of access to Mr. Zayas, but by the conditions and physical setting under which their conversation with Mr. Zayas took place.70 The evidence on the record shows that the Claimants do have access to Mr. Zayas. Moreover, Mexican authorities have granted exceptions to the general visit regime applicable to inmates, including the authorization of counsel for the Claimants and other members of the Claimants' team to meet with Mr. Zayas, allowing the use of computers and other electronic devices, offering separate areas for the interviews, and allowing flexibility in the timing of the previous notice of the visits.\n\nThe Claimants' Renewed Motion, October 7, 2022, pp. 2-3, 5.\n\n63.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Respondent mentioned the possibility of better coordination to improve the conditions of the visits for the purposes of obtaining Mr. Zayas' testimony.71 Further, in a communication dated November 1, 2022 the Respondent indicated that it is taking steps to assure the availability of a room that meets the conditions established by the Tribunal for the meetings of Mr. Zayas and counsel for the Claimants. The Tribunal invites the Parties to seek the necessary coordination, with the cooperation of the Respondent, counsel for Mr. Zayas, and counsel for the Claimants.\n\nCf. Hearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (English version), p. 40 ll 13ff; the Respondent's opening presentation during the hearing, slides 13, 26.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the conditions for interviewing Mr. Zayas in prison are not ideal but, in the majority view and for the above reasons, the situation does not satisfy the threshold of necessity. There is indeed no indication that meeting Mr. Zayas in the current conditions entails a serious or irreparable injury to the Claimants that cannot be redressed by an award of damages.72\n\nCf. *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, February 26, 2010, para. 156 (**CL-0121**).\n\n65.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal also takes the view that the Claimants have failed to fulfill the requirement of proportionality. Interference with criminal proceedings is an intense encroachment on a State's sovereignty.73 The Claimants have requested this Tribunal to intervene in criminal proceedings resulting from a third-party complaint, unrelated to the NAFTA claim, launched against a witness rather than a party to the arbitral proceedings, and where competent domestic courts ordered to hold the detainee in custody due to unjustified failures to appear before criminal judges.74 The fact that counsel for the Claimants has access to Mr. Zayas in less than ideal conditions \u2013 conditions that the Respondent has agreed to improve \u2013 is manifestly insufficient to tip the balance of proportionality in favor of a provisional measure that would allow Mr. Zayas to leave prison and await the result of the criminal proceedings in house arrest. Neither is it reasonable to stay criminal proceedings in the present circumstances. The measures requested by the Claimants are manifestly disproportional.\n\n*EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Procedural Order No. 3, June 23, 2015, para. 77 (**RL-0021**).\n\nThe Tribunal already assessed the circumstances of Mr. Zayas' arrest in Procedural Order No. 3, June 3, 2022, para. 132.\n\n66.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal finally holds that the Claimants have failed to meet the requirement of urgency. There is no evidence that Mr. Zayas' counsel has attempted to obtain house arrest for his client or filed a complaint before Mexican courts about his conditions of imprisonment. The Respondent has shown that it took months for the Claimants' representatives to formally request access to Mr. Zayas after the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3.75 If there is any urgency in the present case, such urgency is \u2013 at least in part \u2013 the result of the conduct of the Claimants and Mr. Zayas' attorney. Under these circumstances, this Tribunal is unable to see an urgency justifying the requested provisional measures.\n\nThe Respondent's Response on the Renewed Motion, October 11, 2022, p. 2; Hearing Transcript, October 25, 2022 (Spanish version), p. 43, ll 10-17.\n\n67.\n\nIn sum, the majority of the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from its previous findings concerning the incarceration of Mr. Zayas. The Claimants have failed to fulfill the requirements for a decision recommending that Mr. Zayas be transferred to house arrest. Neither have they satisfied the even higher standard for ordering a stay of the ongoing criminal proceedings against Mr. Zayas.\n\n68.\n\nFinally, the majority of the Tribunal sees no reason for a refusal by the Claimants to accept conditions other than house arrest that the Respondent has offered and that may allow the Claimants' counsel to meet with Mr. Zayas privately with the proper coordination between the Parties and Mr. Zayas' counsel.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n69.\n\nFor the above reasons, the majority of the Tribunal:\n\n1. **DISMISSES**the Claimants' Renewed Motion of October 7, 2022 in its entirety;\n\n2. **REAFFIRMS**its findings and decisions in Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 7.\n\nDate: November 5, 2022"}]}
