Donziger, et al.\" (for convenience, here called the \"RICO action\");\n\n[4].\n\n**WHEREAS**, by order dated 2 February 2011, after considering written submissions made by the Parties dated 1 February and 2 February 2011, the Tribunal decided to maintain and confirm the oral hearing on 6 February 2011;\n\n[5].\n\n**WHEREAS**, the Tribunal subsequently received the letter dated 2 February 2011 from the President of the Chamber of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios (copied to the Parties) in response to the Tribunal\u2019s letter dated 10 December 2010 regarding the likely date of the first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case, which date currently remains uncertain but potentially imminent;\n\n[6].\n\n**WHEREAS**, on 3 February 2011, the First Claimant submitted an application to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in the RICO action for an order to show cause why a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction should not be entered against the defendants at a hearing fixed for 1400 hours on 8 February 2011, whereby the defendants would be enjoined \"...and any persons acting in concert with them from funding, commencing, prosecuting, advancing in any way, or receiving benefit from, directly or indirectly, any action or proceeding for recognition or enforcement of any judgment entered against Chevron in [the Lago Agrio Case], or for prejudgment seizure or attachment of assets based on any such judgment...\";\n\n[7].\n\n**WHEREAS**, on 6 February 2011, there was an oral hearing in the Small Court Room at the Peace Palace commencing at 0945 hours and concluding at 1645 hours at which the Parties made oral submissions to the Tribunal on the Claimants\u2019 Second Application, recorded by transcript and attended (for the Claimants) by Doak Bishop, Edward Kehoe, Caline Mouawad, Isabel Fernandez de la Cuesta, Kristi Jacques, Elizabeth Silbert (all of King & Spalding), James Crawford (of Matrix Chambers, by telephone from Australia); Hewitt Pate, David Moyer and David Cohen (all of the First Claimant); and (for the Respondent) by Alvaro Galindo Cardona (of the Procuraduria General del Estado), Zachary Douglas (of Matrix Chambers), Eric Bloom and Ricardo Ugarte (both of Winston & Strawn);\n\n[8].\n\n**WHEREAS**, on 6 February 2011, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal continued, until further order, Paragraph C of its order for interim measures of 26 January 2011; and\n\n[9].\n\n**WHEREAS**, on 8 February 2011, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the US District Court for the Southern District of New York had granted that day the First Claimant\u2019s application in the RICO action for a temporary restraining order directing the defendants \"to temporarily refrain from taking any action to seek recognition or enforcement of a Lago Agrio judgment\";\n\n**the tribunal now DECIDES:**\n-----------------------------\n\n[10].\n\n(A) As to jurisdiction, the Tribunal records that it has not yet determined the Respondent\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction (as recorded in the fourth preamble to its Order of 28 January 2011). Nonetheless, for the limited purpose of the present decision, the Tribunal provisionally assumes that it has jurisdiction to decide upon the Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Interim Measures on the ground that the Claimants have established, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal, a sufficient case for the existence of such jurisdiction at this preliminary stage of these arbitration proceedings under the written arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants against the Respondent under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"BIT\"), incorporating by reference the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\");\n\n[11].\n\n(B) The Tribunal notes that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal, at the request of a party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or award) in respect of the subject-matter of the parties\u2019 dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of a final, partial or interim award; (iii) Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award is final and binding on the parties, with the parties undertaking to carry out such award without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the BIT provides (inter alia) that an award rendered pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the BIT under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be binding on the parties to the dispute, with the Contracting Parties undertaking to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement;\n\n[12].\n\n(C) As to form, the Tribunal records that, whilst this decision under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules is made in the form of an order and not an interim award, given the urgency required for such decision, the Tribunal may decide (upon its own initiative or any Party\u2019s request) to confirm such order at a later date in the form of an interim award under Articles 26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules, without the Tribunal hereby intending conclusively to determine the status of this decision, one way or the other, as an award under the 1958 New York Convention.\n\n[13].\n\n(D) As to the grounds for the Claimants\u2019 Second Application, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have made out a sufficient case, to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction, under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, for the order made below in the discretionary exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to take interim measures in respect of the subject-matter of the Parties\u2019 dispute;\n\n[14].\n\n(E) Bearing in mind the Respondent\u2019s several obligations under the BIT and international law, including the Respondent\u2019s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award on the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to make such an award), the Tribunal orders:\n\n(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and\n\n(ii) the Respondent\u2019s Government to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent's legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of this order for interim measures;\n\npending further order or award in these arbitration proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s award on jurisdiction or (assuming jurisdiction) on the merits;\n\n[15].\n\n(F) The Tribunal records that it is common ground between the Claimants and the Respondent in these arbitration proceedings, as also re-confirmed by the Respondent at the oral hearing on 6 February 2011 (page 107 of the English transcript and page 101 of the Spanish transcript) that, under Ecuadorian law, a judgment entered in a domestic proceeding at first instance (such as a first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case) is not final, conclusive or enforceable during the pendency of a first-level appeal until at least such time as that appeal has been decided by the first-level appellate court;\n\n[16].\n\n(G) The Tribunal continues Paragraph C (1) to (3) of its order of 28 January 2011 (which order is incorporated by reference herein);\n\n[17].\n\n(H) The Tribunal decides further that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly and severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in performing its obligations under this order, as may be decided by the Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction);\n\n[18].\n\n(I) This order shall be immediately final and binding upon all Parties, subject only to any subsequent variation made by the Tribunal (upon either its own initiative or any Party\u2019s request); and\n\n[19].\n\n(J) This order, as with the earlier order of 26 January 2011, is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice to any Party\u2019s case as regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimants\u2019 First Application made by letter dated 12 December 2010, the Respondent\u2019s opposition to such First Application, and to any claim or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute."}, {"Title": "First Interim Award on Interim Measures", "Type": "Award (Interim)", "Date": "2012-01-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "First Interim Award on Interim Measures\n---------------------------------------\n\n***(1) THE ORDER OF 14 MAY 2010***\n----------------------------------\n\n***WHEREAS:*** The Tribunal made the following procedural order dated 14 May 2010:\n\n*\"WHEREAS on 23 September 2009, the Claimants served a Notice of Arbitration on the Respondent pursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on 27 August 1993 (the \"Treaty\"), which provides that disputes arising under it may be submitted to an arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\");*\n\n*WHEREAS on 29 September 2009, the Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration;*\n\n*WHEREAS in their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants notified the Respondent of their appointment of Dr. Horacio A.

Whilst the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not named parties to these arbitration proceedings and the Respondent is not a named party to the Lago Agrio Case, the Tribunal records that, as a matter of international law, a State may be responsible for the conduct of its organs, including its judicial organs, as expressed in Chapter II of Part One of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility;*\n\n*3. If it were established that any judgment made by an Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio Case was a breach of an obligation by the Respondent owed to the Claimants as a matter of international law, the Tribunal records that any loss arising from the enforcement of such judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses for which the Respondent would be responsible to the Claimants under international law, as expressed in Part Two of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility; and*\n\n*4. This order for further interim measures is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice to any Party\u2019s case as regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimants\u2019 First and Second Applications, the Respondent\u2019s opposition to these First and Second Applications and any claim or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute. \"*\n\n***(III) THE ORDER OF 9 FEBRUARY 2011***\n----------------------------------------\n\n***WHEREAS:*** The Tribunal made the following procedural order dated 9 February 2011:\n\n*\"WHEREAS, the Tribunal issued its order for interim measures on 28 January 2011, providing (inter alia) for an oral hearing on 6 February 2011 at the Peace Palace, The Hague, the Netherlands on the Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Revised Interim Measures made by letter dated 14 January 2011;*\n\n*WHEREAS, by letter dated 1 February 2011, the Respondent declared its intention not to make written submissions on the Claimants\u2019 Second Application in accordance with Paragraph A of the Tribunal\u2019s order of 26 January 2011;*\n\n*WHEREAS, by e-mail message dated 1 February 2011, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal a copy of the civil complaint filed earlier that same day by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation) in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against several named defendants comprising (inter alios) the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and their legal representatives (but not including the Respondent) for damages and injunctive relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, entitled \"Chevron Corporation v Steven R. Donziger, et al. \" (for convenience, here called the \"RICO action \");*\n\n*WHEREAS, by order dated 2 February 2011, after considering written submissions made by the Parties dated 1 February and 2 February 2011, the Tribunal decided to maintain and confirm the oral hearing on 6 February 2011;*\n\n*WHEREAS, the Tribunal subsequently received the letter dated 2 February 2011 from the President of the Chamber of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios (copied to the Parties) in response to the Tribunal\u2019s letter dated 10 December 2010 regarding the likely date of the first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case, which date currently remains uncertain but potentially imminent;*\n\n*WHEREAS, on 3 February 2011, the First Claimant submitted an application to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in the RICO action for an order to show cause why a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction should not be entered against the defendants at a hearing fixed for 1400 hours on 8 February 2011, whereby the defendants would be enjoined \"...and any persons acting in concert with them from funding, commencing, prosecuting, advancing in any way, or receiving benefit from, directly or indirectly, any action or proceeding for recognition or enforcement of any judgment entered against Chevron in [the Lago Agrio Case], or for prejudgment seizure or attachment of assets based on any such judgment... \";*\n\n*WHEREAS, on 6 February 2011, there was an oral hearing in the Small Court Room at the Peace Palace commencing at 0945 hours and concluding at 1645 hours at which the Parties made oral submissions to the Tribunal on the Claimants\u2019 Second Application, recorded by transcript and attended (for the Claimants) by Doak Bishop, Edward Kehoe, Caline Mouawad, Isabel Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cuesta, Kristi Jacques, Elizabeth Silbert (all of King & Spalding), James Crawford (of Matrix Chambers, by telephone from Australia); Hewitt Pate, David Moyer and David Cohen (all of the First Claimant); and (for the Respondent) by Alvaro Galindo Cardona (of the Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado), Zachary Douglas (of Matrix Chambers), Eric Bloom and Ricardo Ugarte (both of Winston & Strawn);*\n\n*WHEREAS, on 6 February 2011, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal continued, until further order, Paragraph C of its order for interim measures of 26 January 2011; and*\n\n*WHEREAS, on 8 February 2011, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the US District Court for the Southern District of New York had granted that day the First Claimant\u2019s application in the RICO action for a temporary restraining order directing the defendants \"to temporarily refrain from taking any action to seek recognition or enforcement of a Lago Agrio judgment \";*\n\n*THE TRIBUNAL NOW DECIDES:*\n\n*(A) As to jurisdiction, the Tribunal records that it has not yet determined the Respondent\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction (as recorded in the fourth preamble to its Order of 28 January 2011). Nonetheless, for the limited purpose of the present decision, the Tribunal provisionally assumes that it has jurisdiction to decide upon the Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Interim Measures on the ground that the Claimants have established, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal, a sufficient case for the existence of such jurisdiction at this preliminary stage of these arbitration proceedings under the written arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants against the Respondent under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"BIT\"), incorporating by reference the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"UNCITRAL Rules');*\n\n*(B) The Tribunal notes that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal, at the request of a party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or award) in respect of the subject-matter of the parties\u2019 dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of a final, partial or interim award; (iii) Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award is final and binding on the parties, with the parties undertaking to carry out such award without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the BIT provides (inter alia) that an award rendered pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the BIT under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be binding on the parties to the dispute, with the Contracting Parties undertaking to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement;*\n\n*(C) As to form, the Tribunal records that, whilst this decision under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules is made in the form of an order and not an interim award, given the urgency required for such decision, the Tribunal may decide (upon its own initiative or any Party\u2019s request) to confirm such order at a later date in the form of an interim award under Articles 26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules, without the Tribunal hereby intending conclusively to determine the status of this decision, one way or the other, as an award under the 1958 New York Convention.*\n\n*(D) As to the grounds for the Claimants\u2019 Second Application, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have made out a sufficient case, to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction, under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, for the order made below in the discretionary exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to take interim measures in respect of the subject-matter of the Parties\u2019 dispute;*\n\n*(E) Bearing in mind the Respondent\u2019s several obligations under the BIT and international law, including the Respondent\u2019s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award on the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to make such an award), the Tribunal orders:*\n\n*(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and*\n\n*(ii) the Respondent\u2019s Government to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent\u2019s legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of this order for interim measures;*\n\n*pending further order or award in these arbitration proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s award on jurisdiction or (assuming jurisdiction) on the merits;*\n\n*(F) The Tribunal records that it is common ground between the Claimants and the Respondent in these arbitration proceedings, as also re-confirmed by the Respondent at the oral hearing on 6 February 2011 (page 107 of the English transcript and page 101 of the Spanish transcript) that, under Ecuadorian law, a judgment entered in a domestic proceeding at first instance (such as a first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case) is not final, conclusive or enforceable during the pendency of a first-level appeal until at least such time as that appeal has been decided by the first-level appellate court;*\n\n*(G) The Tribunal continues Paragraph C (1) to (3) of its order of 28 January 2011 (which order is incorporated by reference herein);*\n\n*(H) The Tribunal decides further that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly and severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in performing its obligations under this order, as may be decided by the Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction);*\n\n*(I) This order shall be immediately final and binding upon all Parties, subject only to any subsequent variation made by the Tribunal (upon either its own initiative or any Party\u2019s request); and*\n\n*(J) This order, as with the earlier order of 26 January 2011, is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice to any Party\u2019s case as regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimants\u2019 First Application made by letter dated 12 December 2010, the Respondent\u2019s opposition to such First Application, and to any claim or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute. \"*\n\n***(IV) THE ORDER OF 16 MARCH 2011***\n-------------------------------------\n\n***WHEREAS:*** The Tribunal made the following procedural order of 16 March 2011:\n\n*\"1. The Tribunal here addresses the four disputed applications in these arbitration proceedings regarding the Tribunal\u2019s several orders for interim measures dated 14 May 2010, 28 January 2011 and 9 February 2011; namely: (i) the first application by the Claimants made by letter dated 23 February 2011; (ii) the second application by the Respondent made by letter dated 24 February 2011; (iii) the third application by the Respondent made by letter dated 28 February 2011; and (iv) the fourth application by the Claimants made by letter dated 4 March 2011.*\n\n*2. First Application: As regards the first application by the Claimants for further interim measures against the Respondent in regard to the criminal proceedings in Ecuador concerning (inter alios) two of the Claimants\u2019 legal representatives (Messrs Ricardo Veiga and Rodrigo P\u00e9rez), the Tribunal refers to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 23 February 2011, the Claimants\u2019 email message dated 25 February 2011 and the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 10 March 2011.*\n\n*3. Having considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions listed in paragraph 2 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants\u2019 application pleaded specifically at page 21 of their letter dated 23 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal\u2019s existing orders for interim measures.*\n\n*4. Second Application: As regards the second application made by the Respondent seeking the revocation of the Tribunal\u2019s order dated 9 February 2011, the Tribunal refers to Part II of the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 24 February 2011 and the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 4 March 2011.*\n\n*5. Having considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions listed in paragraph 4 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent\u2019s application or the Claimants\u2019 counter-application, beyond maintaining its existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.*\n\n*6. Third Application: As regards the third application made by the Respondent in regard to alleged violations by the Claimants of the Tribunal\u2019s orders for interim measures and for further interim measures, the Tribunal refers to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 28 February 2001 and the Claimants\u2019 letters dated 4 and 10 March 2001.*\n\n*7. Having considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions listed in paragraph 6 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent\u2019s application pleaded specifically at page 3 of its letter dated 28 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal\u2019s existing orders for interim measures.*\n\n*8. Fourth Application: As regards the fourth application made by the Claimants in regard to alleged violations by the Respondent of the Tribunal\u2019s order dated 9 February 2011, the Tribunal refers to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 4 March 2011.*\n\n*9. Having considered the written submissions listed in paragraph 8 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants\u2019 application, beyond maintaining the Tribunal\u2019s existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.*\n\n*10. This procedural order shall not prejudice any issue as regards jurisdiction, admissibility or merits in these proceedings; nor shall it preclude any future application by any Party for interim measures or like relief in the event of any change in relevant circumstances. \"*\n\n***(V) THE PARTIES' PRESENT APPLICATIONS***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n***WHEREAS:***\n\n(A) By letter dated 4 January 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Provincial Court of Sucumbios had issued on 3 January 2012 a decision affirming on appeal the decision of the first-instance court of 14 February 2011 in the Ecuadorian legal proceedings entitled Maria Aguinda et al v Chevron Texaco Corporation (also known as the \"Lago Agrio Case\" or \"Lago Agrio Litigation\") whereby the Provincial Court rejected the appeals of both Chevron and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs;

If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3\".*\n\nArticle VI(3): *\"(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL);...\"*\n\nArticle VI(4): *\"Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(b) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\")...\"*\n\nArticle VI(5): *\"Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.\"*\n\nArticle VI(6): *\"Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement.\"*\n\n(For ease of reference, these terms cited from Article VI of the BIT, with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976), are herein collectively called the \"Arbitration Agreement\").\n\n1.11.\n\nIn their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, the Claimants maintained that the requirements of Article VI of the BIT had been met in full to establish this Tribunal's jurisdiction, namely: \"First, Claimants have not submitted this investment dispute either to the courts or administrative tribunals of Ecuador or to any other applicable, previously-agreed dispute settlement procedure. Second, this dispute arose shortly after the Lago Agrio Litigation was commenced in 2003, when Ecuador refused to honor its obligations under the 1995 and 1998 investment agreements. For that reason, the six-month waiting period has expired. In addition, Claimants' representatives have met with various government officials on numerous occasions seeking to resolve this dispute. Moreover, in October 2007, Claimants delivered a letter reiterating this dispute's existence, seeking to resolve it via negotiation, and notifying Ecuador that Claimants would seek international arbitration under the BIT if the matter could not be resolved, All efforts at a negotiated settlement failed\" (paragraph 73).\n\n1.12.\n\nPursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the BIT (cited above), the Arbitration Agreement incorporates the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976).\n\n1.13.\n\nPursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, these arbitration proceedings are deemed to have commenced on 29 September 2009.\n\n1.14.\n\nBy agreement of the Parties (as confirmed by the Tribunal's Agreed Procedural Order No 1), the legal place of this arbitration is The Hague, The Netherlands within the meaning of Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Netherlands is a State that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n1.15.\n\nBy further agreement of the Parties (as also confirmed by the Tribunal's Agreed Procedural Order No 1), English and Spanish are the official languages of this arbitration within the meaning of Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; and, as between them, English is the authoritative language, with all oral proceedings to be simultaneously interpreted and transcribed into English and Spanish.\n\n***(C) The Arbitration Tribunal***\n----------------------------------\n\n1.16.\n\nPursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal is comprised of three arbitrators appointed thereunder as follows:\n\n*Dr. Grigera Na\u00f3n:* In their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, the Claimants notified the Respondent of their appointment as co-arbitrator of Dr. Horacio A. Grigera Na\u00f3n, of 2708 35th Place NW Washington, D.C. 20007, United States of America;\n\n*Professor Lowe:* On 4 December 2009, the Respondent notified the Claimants of its appointment as co-arbitrator of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.\n\n*Mr. Veeder:* By email of 22 January 2010, the Claimants informed the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") that the two co-arbitrators were unable to consent on the appointment of the presiding third arbitrator. Pursuant to the agreement between the Parties concerning the selection of the presiding third arbitrator, the PCA was requested to act as appointing authority and \"if the party appointed arbitrators cannot agree on the President by Jan. 22 [2010], then the PCA will appoint the President but only after the PCA provides the parties an opportunity to comment on the candidate under consideration by the PCA.\" Accordingly, on 25 February 2010 and in accordance with the Parties' agreement, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed as the presiding third arbitrator Mr. V.V. Veeder, of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.\n\n1.17.\n\nBy further agreement of the Parties, the PCA's International Bureau was appointed to administer these arbitration proceedings, with Mr Martin Doe (of the PCA) acting as Administrative Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n***(D) Principal Written Submissions***\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.18.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Notice of Arbitration of 23 September 2009 and their Memorial on the Merits of 6 September 2010. In response to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections listed below, the Claimants submitted their CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction of 6 September 2010 and their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction of 6 November 2010.\n\n1.19.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 26 July 2010 and its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections on 6 October 2010.\n\n1.20.\n\nThereafter, the Parties have made many more written submissions in these proceedings related to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections; but it is unnecessary for present purposes to recite them here.\n\n***(E) Procedural Meetings and the Jurisdiction Hearing***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.21.\n\nThe first procedural meeting took place by telephone conference-call on 26 March 2010. The second procedural meeting took place by telephone conference-call on 9 April 2010. The third procedural meeting took place on 10 & 11 May 2010 in London.\n\n1.22.\n\nBetween April and November 2010, the Tribunal made several procedural orders, including the Agreed Procedural Order No 1 dated 18 May 2010 and its Procedural Orders Nos 2-6. It is unnecessary to set them out here.\n\n1.23.\n\nThe Respondent's jurisdictional objections were the subject of the Hearing on Jurisdiction held on 22 and 23 November 2010 in London (the \"Jurisdiction Hearing\").\n\n1.24.\n\nThis Jurisdiction Hearing was attended by the Parties' legal representatives, as follows: (i) for the Claimants, Mr. Hewitt Pate (Chevron), Mr. David Moyer (Chevron), Mr. Ricardo Reis Veiga (Chevron), Professor James Crawford SC (Matrix Chambers), Mr. Thomas Grant (LCIL, Cambridge), Mr. Doak Bishop (King & Spalding), Mr. Edward Kehoe (King & Spalding), Mr. Thomas Childs (King & Spalding), Ms. Kristi Jacques (King & Spalding), Mr. David Weiss (King & Spalding), Mr. Timothy Sullivan (King & Spalding), Ms. Zhennia Silverman (King & Spalding) and Ms. Carol Tamez (King & Spalding); and (ii) for the Respondent, Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n (the Attorney-General for Ecuador), Dr. Alvaro Galindo Cardona (Director of International Disputes, Attorney General's Office), Dr. Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez (Counsel, Attorney General's Office), Professor Zachary Douglas (Matrix Chambers), Mr. Luis Gonz\u00e1lez (Matrix Chambers), Mr. Eric Bloom (Winston & Strawn), Mr. Ricardo Ugarte (Winston & Strawn), Mr. Tom\u00e1s Leonard (Winston & Strawn), Ms. Rachel Jones (Winston & Strawn), Ms. Elizabeth Rudd (Winston & Strawn) and Mr. Bruno Leurent (Winston & Strawn).\n\n1.25.\n\nIn addition, the Jurisdiction Hearing was attended by the Tribunal's Administrative Secretary, with Mr. David Kasdan and Mr. Dante Rinaldi as shorthand-writers and Mr. Jose Antonio Carvallo-Quintana and Mr. Thomas Gonz\u00e1lez Castro as interpreters.\n\n1.26.\n\nIn regard to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, the Parties made opening oral submissions on the first day of the Jurisdiction Hearing1, for the Respondent: the Attorney-General for Ecuador, Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n [D1.5]; Mr. Bloom [D1.14], Professor Douglas [D1.30], Mr. Leonard [D1.69]; Mr. Ugarte [D1.86] and Mr Bloom again [D1,101]; and for the Claimants: Chevron's General Counsel, Mr. Pate [D1,111], Mr. Bishop [D1,114], Mr. Kehoe [D1,119], Mr. Bishop again [D1,164] and Professor Crawford [D1,190].

For convenience, the Tribunal refers herein to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections as referring both to its objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the Claimants' claims in these arbitration proceedings.\n\n1.31.\n\nThis Award addresses only the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.\n\n***PART II :*** ***RELEVANT EXTRACTS FROM THE BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1.\n\n*The BIT:* The Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (herein called the \"BIT\") provides as follows.\n\n2.2.\n\n*Preamble:* The BIT's Preamble provides:\n\n\" *The United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador (hereinafter the \"Parties\");*\n\n*Desiring to promote greater economic cooperation between them, with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party;*\n\n*Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties;*\n\n*Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources;*\n\n*Recognizing that the development of economic and business ties can contribute to the wellbeing of workers in both Parties and promote respect for internationally recognized worker rights; and*\n\n*Having resolved to conclude a Treaty concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investment;*\n\n*Have agreed as follows:...\"*\n\n2.3.\n\n*Article I(1): Article* I(1) of the BIT provides (inter alia):\n\n*\"For the purposes of this Treaty,*\n\n*(a) \u2018investment' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to:... and*\n\n*(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licences and permits* *pursuant to law;...\"*\n\n*(b) \u2018company' of a party means any kind of corporation, company, association, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled;...*\n\n2.4.\n\n*Article 1(3):* Article I(3) of the BIT provides:\n\n*\"Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment.\"*\n\n2.5.\n\n*Article II(3)* : Article II(3) of the BIT provides:\n\n*(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.*\n\n*(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered and addressed the Parties' submissions in full; and the fact that a particular submission has not been summarised below should not be taken as indicating that it has been left unconsidered by the Tribunal.\n\n3.3.\n\nIt is necessary first to set out, in the form of chronology, the relevant facts alleged by the Claimants. As explained below in Part IV of this Award, the Tribunal is required under the BIT and the Arbitration Agreement to take account of the factual allegations pleaded by the Claimants as regards the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal makes no finding in regard to any such facts in this Award; nor could it do so at this early stage of the arbitration when the Parties' cases and evidence on the merits of their respective claims and defences are materially incomplete.\n\n***(B) The Claimants' Factual Chronology***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n3.4.\n\nThis factual chronology of the principal events alleged by the Claimants is taken by the Tribunal largely from Part II (\"Factual Background\") of the Claimants' Notice of Arbitration, for necessary reasons explained above. This chronology is prepared by the Tribunal for the purpose only of this Award; and it has not been agreed by the Respondent; nor, as also explained above, does it contain any disputed facts found by the Tribunal.\n\n3.5.\n\n*1964-1972:* In 1964, the Respondent granted oil exploration and production rights in Ecuador's Oriente region to TexPet and the Ecuadorian Gulf Oil Company (\"Gulf\") under a Concession Agreement dated 21 February 1964 made with these companies' local subsidiaries operating as a Consortium. Oriente lies in Ecuador's north-eastern region, in the Amazon Basin. In 1967, this Consortium discovered oil in Oriente and drilled its first well; and in 1972, nine oil fields were developed and an oil pipeline constructed.\n\n3.6.\n\n*1973 Concession Agreement:* On 6 August 1973, the Respondent, TexPet and Gulf entered into a further concession agreement with a term expiring on 6 June 1992 (herein called \"the 1973 Concession Agreement\"). It was also agreed (inter alia) to grant to PetroEcuador (also known as \"CEPE\") an option to acquire an interest in the Consortium; and in 1974 PetroEcuador exercised that option, thereby acquiring a 25% stake in the Consortium. On 31 December 1976, PetroEcuador acquired Gulf's remaining interest, thereby acquiring a 62.5% interest in the Consortium. TexPet retained its 37.5% interest until the Consortium ended in 1992.\n\n3.7.\n\nDuring the term of the 1973 Concession Agreement, the Consortium drilled 312 wells, developed 16 producing wells, built 18 production stations, installed extensive pipelines and constructed 6 base camps. The Consortium made all decisions on exploration, financing and operations for the concession; it paid royalties and other fees to the Respondent, and it was subject to Ecuadorian Governmental regulation. From 1965, TexPet, as the Consortium's first operator, conducted the physical work for the Consortium; but it was the Consortium as a whole that enjoyed the concession's profits and also bore the operational risks and any liabilities associated with its operations. In 1990, Petroamazonas (PetroEcuador's subsidiary created specifically for this task) assumed the role of operator in place of TexPet.\n\n3.8.\n\nThroughout the term of the Consortium's concession, the Ecuadorian Government regulated, approved and, in many instances, mandated the Consortium's activities; and no facilities were constructed, nor wells drilled, nor oil extracted without the Government's oversight and approval. Specifically, section 46 of the 1973 Concession Agreement imposed obligations on the Consortium in regard to the preservation of natural resources; and in 1976 the Respondent enacted the \"Law for Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination\".\n\n3.9.\n\nDuring the existence of the Consortium, approximately 90% of the revenues generated by the concession (approximately US$ 23 billion) were paid directly to the Respondent in the form of revenues, royalties, taxes and subsidies; the Respondent and PetroEcuador held full regulatory control over the Consortium (as well as a majority share of its ownership), and they received almost all of the economic benefits from the Consortium's operations. Texaco and TexPet received about US$ 500 million.\n\n3.10.\n\nIn 1990 (when Petroamazonas assumed the role of operator), TexPet and the Respondent agreed to conduct an environmental audit of the Consortium's oil fields. Two international contractors conducted separate environmental audits to ascertain the scope of environmental impacts from the Consortium's operations. These audits identified certain areas for environmental remediation and estimated that the total cost to remediate such areas would be approximately US$ 8 million to US$ 13 million.\n\n3.11.\n\n*1992:* The 1973 Concession Agreement came to an end on 6 June 1992; and TexPet then transferred its interest in the Consortium to PetroEcuador. TexPet had thus been a minority member of the Consortium which had explored for and produced oil in Ecuador for about 28 years (from 1964 to 1992); and it had been the Consortium's operator under the 1973 Concession Agreement for about 25 years (to 1990). After 1992, TexPet had no ownership interest or involvement in any production activities in Ecuador.\n\n3.12.\n\n*1994:* In 1994, the Respondent decided that it would not participate with TexPet in conducting environmental remediation. Thus, rather than jointly funding remediation of the entire concession area, the parties agreed to identify a set of remediation obligations corresponding only to TexPet's minority ownership interest in the Consortium in exchange for TexPet being released from any further liabilities or remediation obligations for environmental impact.\n\n3.13.\n\n*The 1994 MOU:* Accordingly, on 14 December 1994, the Respondent (by its Ministry of Energy and Mines), PetroEcuador and TexPet signed a Memorandum of Understanding (herein called the \"1994 MOU\") in which they agreed to \"negotiate the full and complete release of TexPet's obligations for environmental impact arising from the operations of the Consortium.\" The 1994 MOU referred expressly to the \"environmental impacts\" caused by the Consortium's operations: see particularly Articles 1(d), IV(b) and V of the 1994 MOU.\n\n3.14.\n\nThe \"release\" of TexPet would be accomplished in two steps. First, from the outset, TexPet would be released from any responsibility for environmental impacts not included in the \"Scope of Work\" (which was to specify the remediation tasks to be performed by TexPet). Second, TexPet would be released from any responsibility related to the Scope of Work upon performance of such Work.\n\n3.15.\n\nTogether, this two-step release would discharge TexPet from any claims that the Respondent and PetroEcuador might have against TexPet concerning environmental impacts caused by the Consortium's operations. At that time, only the Respondent's Government could require the environmental remediation of public land; and therefore by law (according to the Claimants) a settlement with the Respondent would fully discharge TexPet of any responsibility that might exist for environmental impacts on public land. However (as the Claimants acknowledge) it would not affect potential individualised claims for alleged personal injury or damage to private property.\n\n3.16.\n\n*The 1995 Scope of Work:* On 23 March 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet signed the Scope of Work identifying the particular sites and projects that would constitute TexPet's remediation tasks under the 1994 MOU. TexPet also agreed to finance certain socio-economic projects in Ecuador; and the Respondent insisted (as part of the consideration for TexPet's release) that TexPet should negotiate with four specified municipalities in the Oriente region claiming compensation for alleged environmental harm resulting from the Consortium's operations.\n\n3.17.\n\n*The 1995 Settlement Agreement:* On 4 May 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet made a Settlement Agreement (herein called the \"1995 Settlement Agreement\"). It provided in its preamble that TexPet agreed to undertake \"Environmental Remedial Work in consideration for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations.\" The term \"Environmental Impact\" included: \"[a]ny solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present or released into the environment in such concentration or condition, the presence or release of which causes, or has the potential to cause harm to human health or the environment.\"\n\n3.18.\n\nAs contemplated in the 1994 MOU, the 1995 Settlement Agreement: (i) released TexPet from all of the Respondent's and PetroEcuador's claims based on any Environmental Impact (except for claims related to TexPet's performance of the Scope of Work); and (ii) provided that TexPet would be released from all remaining environmental liability upon completion of the remediation obligations described in that Scope of Work.\n\n3.19.\n\nTexPet and PetroEcuador made a further agreement dated 17 November 1995, effectively confirming TexPet's obligations in the 1995 Settlement Agreement (page 43).\n\n3.20.\n\n*1995-1998:* For the remediation work contemplated by the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent provided a list of approved, independent environmental engineering contractors; and from that list, TexPet selected Woodward-Clyde, a large and reputable environmental engineering firm. Woodward-Clyde began its work by conducting additional investigations of the sites listed in the Scope of Work and developing a \"Remedial Action Plan\". The Remedial Action Plan identified the specific pits at each well-site that required remediation under the criteria set out in the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and it further clarified the remedial action to be taken at each site. In September 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet each approved that Remedial Action Plan.\n\n3.21.\n\nBetween October 1995 and September 1998, Woodward-Clyde conducted (on behalf of and paid for by TexPet) the remediation required by the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the Remedial Action Plan. As part of its work, Woodward-Clyde and its sub-contractors undertook the following items: remediate and close 162 pits and 6 spill areas at 133 well sites; remediate contaminated soil (roughly 6,000 cubic meters) at 13 production stations, 5 abandoned installations and 17 well sites; identify and supply water treatment and processing equipment at 6 production stations and at 4 well sites; design and implement plugging and abandonment work at 18 previously abandoned well sites; recover, treat, upgrade and recycle approximately 28,000 barrels of hydrocarbon material from the remediated pits; and re-vegetate affected areas using native Amazonian plant species, or turn those areas over to the local communities for alternate land use. The responsible ministries and agencies of the Respondent's Government's oversaw and approved all of this remediation and reclamation work.\n\n3.22.\n\nAs already indicated above, the 1995 Settlement Agreement also required TexPet to provide socio-economic compensation by funding certain community development projects in Ecuador. Specifically, TexPet paid US$ 1 million for the construction of four educational centres and adjacent medical facilities (which included funds for two river ambulances); paid US$ 1 million for agricultural and forestry projects to be carried out by indigenous and peasant organizations in the Amazon Basin; and purchased and donated an airplane for the use of the Amazon Basin's indigenous communities.\n\n3.23.\n\n*The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases:* As requested by the Respondent, TexPet also settled disputes with the four municipalities of the Oriente region. TexPet entered into written settlements with these four municipalities, as well as with the province of Sucumb\u00edos and the Napo consortium of municipalities (herein collectively called the \"Municipal and Provincial Releases\"). Under these settlements, TexPet paid approximately US$ 3.7 million for (inter alia) potable water and sewage projects; and TexPet, with its parent company, affiliates and others were then released from any liability by the municipalities (including liability for environmental impact) for any of the Consortium's activities in the area of the concession. These settlements were approved and confirmed by Ecuadorian Courts.\n\n3.24.\n\nIn all, TexPet paid approximately US$ 40 million on environmental remediation and community development in Ecuador pursuant to the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the Municipal and Provincial Releases.\n\n3.25.\n\n*The BIT* : The BIT entered into force on 11 May 1997. (This is not disputed by the Parties).\n\n3.26.\n\n*The 1998 Final Release:* During the three-year period from October 1995 to September 1998, the Respondent's Government issued nine *actas* documenting its acceptance that pits listed therein were remediated under TexPet's agreements and certifying the adequacy of the remediation work that it had supervised and evaluated on a continuous basis. Each of those *actas* was in turn supported by hundreds of certification documents. On 30 September 1998, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet executed the *Acta Final,* certifying that TexPet had performed all of its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and releasing TexPet from any and all environmental liability arising from the Consortium's operations (herein called \"the 1998 Final Release\"). The Respondent and PetroEcuador retained responsibility for any remaining and future environmental impact and remediation work.\n\n3.27.\n\n*The Aguinda Litigation***:** In November 1993 (before the 1995 Settlement Agreement & 1998 Final Release but after the Consortium's termination in 1992), U.S. attorneys filed a putative class action lawsuit for certain plaintiffs against Texaco in the U.S. Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York (the *\"Aguinda* litigation \"). The Aguinda plaintiffs, claiming to represent 30,000 members of a class residing in or near the Oriente region, claimed substantial compensation from Texaco for personal injuries and damage to their own property allegedly caused by TexPet's actions as the Consortium's operator.\n\n3.28.\n\nTexaco applied to the New York District Court for an order dismissing the complaint on grounds of (inter alia) forum non conveniens; and the Respondent supported the application. The Respondent also advised the New York Court that the Respondent was \"the legal protector of the quality of the air, water, atmosphere and environment within its frontiers\", as well as \"legal owner of the rivers, streams and natural resources and all public lands where the [Consortium's] oil producing operations\" took place; that the plaintiffs had no independent right to litigate over public lands and that \"the [Aguinda] plaintiffs' attorneys in this matter are attempting to usurp rights that belong to the government of the Republic of the Respondent under the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and under international law.\" In an interview, the Respondent's Ambassador to the United States of America confirmed that \"the soil, the subsoil, the vegetation, the air... all of these are property belonging to the Nation of Ecuador, not to the individuals living there, and not to the lawyers drawing up the claims... Nobody can seek compensation for damages in property belonging to the Ecuadorian Government. Only the Government can litigate. No third parties.\"\n\n3.29.\n\nIn 1996, the New York District Court granted Texaco's application to dismiss the *Aguinda* litigation on the ground of forum non conveniens; and the Aguinda plaintiffs then appealed this decision to the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1998, the Court of Appeals vacated the decision and remitted the case back to the New York District Court.\n\n3.30.\n\nDuring this period, the Aguinda plaintiffs' lawyers (reportedly, according to the Claimants) also lobbied for new legislation in Ecuador that would enable them to file new claims against Texaco. In July 1999 (after the 1998 Final Release), the Respondent enacted the Law of Environmental Management, also known as the Environmental Management Act (the \"1999 EMA\"). Article 41 of the 1999 EMA grants to individuals the right to bring a complaint to enforce \"collective environmental rights\"; and Article 43 allows individuals \"linked by a common interest and directly affected by the harmful action or omission\" to file a complaint \"for damages and for the deterioration caused to health or the environment.\"\n\n3.31.\n\nIn 2000, the New York District Court again dismissed the *Aguinda* litigation on the grounds of forum non conveniens, subject to Texaco's consent to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian courts (as directed by the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals). In 2002, the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court.\n\n3.32.\n\n*Texaco's Jurisdictional Consent:* The consent as to Ecuadorian jurisdiction by Texaco before the District Court and Court of Appeals was expressed on 11 January 1999, in writing (here cited from Sections A and B of its Notice of Agreements in Satisfying Forum Non Conveniens and International Comity Conditions):\n\n*\"Section A - Actions to Which Agreements Apply: Texaco Inc.'s agreements herein apply only to a lawsuit that meets all the following conditions:*\n\n*1. The lawsuit must be brought by a named plaintiff in Aguinda. et al. v, Texaco Inc., Case No. 93 Civ. 7527 (JSR) (hereafter \"Aguinda\").*\n\n*2. The lawsuit must have been filed in an appropriate court of competent civil jurisdiction in Ecuador;*\n\n*3. The lawsuit must arise out of the same events and occurrences alleged in the Aguinda Complaint filed in this Court on November 3, 1993.*\n\n*4. To insure prompt notice, a copy of each Complaint intended to be filed by Aguinda plaintiffs (or any of them) in Ecuador must have been delivered to Texaco Inc.'s designated representative in Ecuador identified in Section B(1) below not later than the actual date on which it is filed.*\n\n*Section B - Agreements: With respect to any lawsuit that meets the conditions set forth above (a \"Foreign Lawsuit\"), Texaco Inc. hereby makes the following agreements:*\n\n*1. Texaco Inc. will accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit in accordance with the applicable law of Ecuador. Texaco Inc.'s designated representative in Ecuador authorized to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit shall be: [Name and address of Texaco's representative in Quito Ecuador here omitted]. The authority of [Texaco's representative] to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit will*\n\n*become effective upon final dismissal of this action and judgment by this Court. (The judgment shall become \"final\" upon the exhaustion of all available appeals or, if no appeal is filed, the time for filing appeals has expired.)*\n\n*2. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive and/or not assert an objection based on lack of in personam jurisdiction to the civil jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in Ecuador.*\n\n*3. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive any statute of limitations-based defense that matured during the period of time between: (a) the filing date of the Aguinda Complaint in this Court (i.e. November 3, 1993), and (b) the 60th day after the dismissal of this action and judgment becomes final, as defined in Section* *B(1) above. Texaco Inc., however, is not waiving any statute of limitations-based rights or defenses with respect to the passage of time prior to November 3, 1993, and Texaco Inc. expressly reserves its right to contend in a Foreign Lawsuit that plaintiffs' claims were barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable statute of limitations as of November 3, 1993 when they filed their Complaint in this Court.*\n\n*4. Texaco Inc. agrees that discovery conducted to date during the pendency of Aguinda in this Court may be used by any party in a Foreign Lawsuit, including Texaco Inc., to the same extent as if that discovery had been conducted in proceedings there, subject to all parties' rights to challenge the admissibility and relevance of such discovery under the applicable rules of evidence.*\n\n*5. Texaco Inc. agrees to satisfy a final judgment (i.e. a judgment with respect to which all appeals have been exhausted), if any, entered against it in a Foreign Lawsuit in favor of a named plaintiff in Aguinda, subject to Texaco Inc.'s reservation of its right to contest any such judgment under New York's Recognition of Foreign Country* *Money Judgments Act, 7B N.Y. Civ. Prac. L&R \u00a7 5301-09 (McKinney 1978).\"*\n\n3.33.\n\nIn 2001, Texaco and Chevron (with their subsidiaries, including TexPet) \"merged\" under the laws of the USA. (The legal effect of this merger is at issue in the Parties' dispute). Chevron was not earlier involved with TexPet or its past activities in Ecuador.\n\n3.34.\n\n*The Lago Agrio Litigation:* On 30 May 2003, a different but overlapping group of 48 Ecuadorian citizens as plaintiffs filed a complaint against Texaco as defendant in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio (the *\"Lago Agrio* litigation\"). The Lago Agrio plaintiffs claimed damages and other remedies for environmental remediation of former Consortium sites pursuant to a retroactive application of the 1999 EMA. The Claimants describe this complaint as a \"diffuse claim\", i.e. a claim where the plaintiffs are not seeking individual damages in respect of any personal injuries to themselves or any damage to their own property but are instead advancing public, collective and non-individual rights that belong to all in the region. These plaintiffs were and remain supported by some of the same U.S. attorneys who had filed the *Aguinda* litigation in the New York Courts.\n\n3.35.\n\nThe complaint named Texaco as the defendant; but it impleaded Chevron as a defendant on the basis that, upon the \"merger\" in 2001, Chevron was \"substituted\" for Texaco's \"rights and obligations\" and was therefore liable to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs (paragraph I.11). The Respondent is not a named party in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.\n\n3.36.\n\nIn Chevron's answer of October 2003 to the Lago Agrio complaint, Chevron objected to the Lago Agrio Court's assumption and exercise of jurisdiction over Chevron on the basis that (i) Chevron is a distinct legal entity from Texaco that first acquired an indirect ownership interest in TexPet only in 2001, with TexPet, Texaco and Chevron still remaining distinct legal entities; (ii) Chevron was never the operator of the Consortium or a party to any of the concession contracts; nor is it the legal successor-in-interest of Texaco; and (iii) it was Texaco, not Chevron, that consented to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts upon the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' decision confirming the District Court's order dismissing the *Aguinda* litigation.\n\n3.37.\n\nChevron also requested the dismissal of the Lago Agrio complaint based on the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Municipal and Provincial Releases and the 1998 Final Release. In particular, Chevron contended that TexPet, TexPet's parent company, affiliates and principals received a full and complete release from any such liability under the 1995 Settlement Agreement (thereby including TexPet's future indirect owner, Chevron); that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs lacked standing to bring any claims under the 1999 EMA; and that the 1999 EMA should not be applied retroactively to the Consortium's operations which had ended many years earlier, in 1992.\n\n3.38.\n\nChevron also notified the Respondent by letter of October 2003 that the Lago Agrio claims clearly fell within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Municipal and Provincial Releases and the 1998 Final Release; and that the Respondent and PetroEcuador should bear financial responsibility for any obligation relating to the Consortium and from any court rulings that might be made against Chevron. Chevron also requested the Respondent: (i) to notify the Lago Agrio Court that, under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release, Chevron, Texaco and TexPet could not be liable for environmental damage or for remediation work arising from the former Consortium's operations; and (ii) to indemnify, protect and defend the rights of Chevron, Texaco and TexPet in connection with the *Lago Agri* o litigation. According to the Claimants, the Respondent did not do so.\n\n3.39.\n\n*The BIT Claims:* In regard to the *Lago Agrio* litigation, the Claimants contend that, through the Respondent's actions and inactions in breach of its several obligations under the BIT to both Claimants, the Respondent is improperly seeking to impose upon Chevron the public remediation obligations and liabilities that belong exclusively to the Respondent and PetroEcuador; that never belonged to Chevron; from which the Respondent and PetroEcuador expressly released TexPet, its parent company, affiliates and principals (thereby including Chevron); that rather than honouring its obligations under the BIT and the relevant agreements made with TexPet, the Respondent has chosen to collude unlawfully with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs in order to evade the Respondent's own legal responsibilities and to secure an illegitimate financial windfall from Chevron; that the Respondent has pursued a coordinated strategy with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs that involves the Respondent's various state organs; that the Respondent's executive branch has publicly announced its support for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs; that the Respondent has sought and obtained the sham criminal indictments of two Chevron attorneys (Messrs Viega and P\u00e9rez) in an attempt to undermine the 1995 Settlement Agreement and to interfere with Chevron's defence in the *Lago Agrio* litigation; that the Respondent's judicial branch has conducted the *Lago Agrio* litigation in total disregard of Ecuadorian law, international standards of fairness and Chevron's basic rights as to due process and natural justice, in co-ordination between the Respondent and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs.\n\n3.40.\n\nAs already indicated, the Claimants' claims in this arbitration are, as regards their formal prayer for relief on the merits, set out above in Part I of this Award.\n\n***(C) The Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n3.41.\n\nOn 26 July 2010, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, disputing the Tribunal's jurisdiction in this arbitration to decide the Claimants' claims in this arbitration (on grounds of jurisdiction and admissibility).\n\n3.42.\n\n*Factual Introduction:* In its introductory observations, the Respondent summarises its version of the background to the Parties' dispute, from the 1973 Concession Agreement, under which the Respondent granted to TexPet the right to explore for and produce oil in Ecuador, the *Aguinda* litigation, the disputes with the Municipalities, the various settlement agreements, to the *Lago Agrio* litigation.\n\n3.43.\n\nIn relation to TexPet's original investment and operations in Ecuador, the Respondent emphasises that the 1973 Concession Agreement expired in 1992, five years before the BIT came into force. It stresses that \"TexPet has had no ownership interest or involvement in any production activities in Ecuador\" since 1992; and that \"Chevron has never invested in Ecuador \u2026 whatever investment it claims exists for purposes of this dispute derives solely from TexPet's purported \"investments\".1\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 10\n\n3.44.\n\nThe Respondent records that in 1993 a group of Ecuadorian citizens brought a class action as plaintiffs against Texaco as defendant in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (i.e. \"the *Aguinda* litigation\") on behalf of all the citizens and residents of Oriente in the region of the Amazon. The Respondent asserts that, in the *Aguinda* litigation, the plaintiffs were seeking environmental remediation of the land and waters of the region, in addition to personal damages.2 The Respondent recounts that Texaco contended that the plaintiffs' claims in the *Aguinda* litigation should be dismissed by the New York District Court on the ground of forum non conveniens (under US law) because the Ecuadorian Courts were a more appropriate forum; that, in 1996, the District Court granted Texaco's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' action; that, in 1998, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated such dismissal on the basis (inter alia) that the dismissal was inappropriate unless Texaco consented to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts; and that, in the light of this appellate decision, Texaco then undertook to accept the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts in relation to claims \"arising out of the same events and occurrences alleged in the Aguinda complaint\".3\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 12\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 13-15\n\n3.45.\n\nThe Respondent notes that in 1994 four municipalities in the Oriente region filed legal complaints in Ecuador against TexPet, alleging environmental contamination.4\n\n*Ibid*., para. 18\n\n3.46.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these several disputes provide the general background to the various settlement agreements made by the Respondent, the municipalities, PetroEcuador and TexPet. The Respondent also highlights the following features of these different agreements:\n\n3.47.\n\nFirst, under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet mutually acknowledged that: \"all the rights and obligations of each of the parties with respect to the other and deriving from the [1973 Concession Agreement] are terminated\".5\n\n*Ibid*., para. 19\n\n3.48.\n\nSecond, environmental issues were excluded from the 1995 Settlement Agreement.6\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 20\n\n3.49.\n\nThird, the 1994 MOU was entered into by TexPet as a voluntary agreement.7\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 20\n\n3.50.\n\nFourth, by its terms, the objective of the 1994 MOU was only to provide a mechanism to release TexPet from liability for those claims belonging to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (for the Respondent) and PetroEcuador; and the Respondent asserts that it expressly rejected a suggestion from TexPet that the intended release should extend to claims by the people of the Amazon region. On the contrary, the Respondent points out that the final version of the MOU contained a \"carve out\" (Article VIII), which made it clear that the MOU would apply without prejudice to the potential rights of third parties against PetroEcuador and TexPet as members of the Consortium.8\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 21-24\n\n3.51.\n\nFifth, the 1995 Settlement Agreement, consistent with the objectives of the 1994 MOU, operated only to release TexPet from claims by the Respondent and PetroEcuador. The Respondent also asserts that there is nothing in the 1995 Settlement Agreement which requires it to intervene in private litigation by others. Further, it is contended that the Respondent is prohibited by Ecuadorian law from waiving the rights of its own citizens to seek legal redress.9\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 29-31\n\n3.52.\n\nSixth, the Municipal and Provincial Releases made in May 1996 similarly operated to release only these municipalities' claims against TexPet, Texaco, their affiliates and related companies, etc; and these settlements did not release the rights of non-parties to these releases.10\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 32\n\n3.53.\n\nSeventh, in relation to the 1998 Final Release, the Respondent emphasises that this released TexPet only from its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and did not contain any \"hold harmless\" or indemnification obligation by the Respondent in favour of TexPet or Texaco in relation to the *Aguinda* litigation or any other environmental claims.11\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 35\n\n3.54.\n\nIn relation to the *Lago Agrio* litigation, the Respondent points out that it was brought in Ecuador by all plaintiffs in the New York *Aguinda* litigation and that the main allegations made in the *Lago Agrio* litigation are essentially identical to those made in the *Aguinda* litigation.12 The Respondent notes that the principal claims in the *Lago Agrio* litigation are based upon Ecuadorian substantive law.13\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 36\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 40\n\n3.55.\n\nFinally, as regards this factual introduction, the Respondent submits that these BIT proceedings were commenced just months after the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York had brought to an end the AAA arbitration proceedings which had been commenced by TexPet and Chevron against the Respondent. The Respondent asserts that, in these BIT proceedings, the Claimants are asserting the same \"release\" and \"indemnification\" claims which they had raised and then agreed to dismiss in the AAA Arbitration.14\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 44\n\n3.56.\n\n*Jurisdictional Objections:* The Respondent's jurisdictional objections are further considered seriatim below, in Part IV of this Award. The following is intended by the Tribunal merely as a convenient summary of the Respondent's principal objections.\n\n3.57.\n\n*(i)-(iii) Ratione Materiae:* The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT because:\n\n(i) The dispute does not arise out of or relate to an investment in Ecuador, for the purposes of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT; or\n\n(ii) The dispute does not arise out of an investment agreement, for the purposes of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT; and\n\n(iii) The Claimants have no prima facie case on the merits.\n\n3.58.\n\n*(iv) Fork in the Road:* The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction by virtue of Article VI(3) of the BIT (its \"fork in the road\" provision) because the Claimants have previously elected to pursue claims in an alternative forum.\n\n3.59.\n\n*(v) Third Party Rights:* The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because it would be required to determine the rights of third parties, i.e. non-parties to these arbitration proceedings.\n\n3.60.\n\nIt is convenient to summarise the Respondent's case under each of these five objections.\n\n3.61.\n\n*(i) Article VI(1)(c):* The Respondent contends that the Claimants rely upon two characterisations of an \"investment\" for the purposes of Art VI(1)(c): (i) the \"original\" investment, namely \"TexPet's underlying oil operations in Ecuador\"; and (ii) their rights under the Settlement Agreements.15\n\n*Ibid*., para. 46\n\n3.62.\n\nWith respect to the first characterisation of an investment, whilst the Respondent acknowledges that TexPet originally did invest in Ecuador, the Respondent maintains that this investment came to an end in 1992.16 The Respondent therefore denies that TexPet can bring its present claims within the scope of that original investment; and it specifically denies the Claimant's argument based on the \"lifespan of the investment\".\n\n*Ibid*., para. 47\n\n3.63.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent discounts the principal legal material relied upon by the Claimants, namely the *Commercial Cases Dispute,* where the tribunal decided in its award:\n\n*\"The Claimants' investments were largely liquidated when they transferred their ownership in the concession to PetroEcuador and upon the conclusion of various Settlement Agreements with Ecuador. Yet, those investments were and are not yet fully wound up because of ongoing claims for money arising directly out of their oil extraction and production activities under their contracts with Ecuador and its state owned oil company. These claims were excluded from any of the Settlement Agreements\u2026\"*\n\n3.64.\n\nAlthough it involved the same disputing parties as this arbitration, the Respondent submits that the award in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* does not have any res judicata effect, as the Claimants contend, because, that arbitration did not decide the same issue as is raised in this arbitration and, in particular, because the reasoning in that award was based solely on the 1973 Concession Agreement and did not analyse the settlement agreements at issue in this case.17\n\n*Ibid*., para. 60\n\n3.65.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that the awards in both the *Commercial Cases Dispute* and *Mondev* (the other legal material cited by the Claimants on the \"lifespan of the investment\") are both distinguishable from the present case. In both those cases, the interest or agreement said to constitute the \"investment\" was the direct subject of the claims in issue; whereas, in the present case, the 1973 Concession Agreement is not at issue in the *Lago Agrio* litigation. On the contrary, the *Lago Agrio* litigation puts in issue the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release which are \"stand-alone\" agreements and not investments.18\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 63-65\n\n3.66.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on contemporaneous documentation to dismiss the Claimants' assertion that the release, remediation with other activities and the *Lago* *Agrio* litigation \"are all part of the continuation, winding up, disposition, and enforcement of legal and contractual rights arising directly from, and part of, Claimants' Ecuadorian investment.\"19\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 65\n\n3.67.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants' second characterisation of an investment, the Respondent contends that none of the settlement agreements (and none of the rights and obligations contained therein) invoked by the Claimants bears the intrinsic economic characteristics of an investment under Article I of the BIT.20 More particularly, the Respondent, relying on the *Pantechniki* and *Romak* awards, submits that an investment \"must exhibit the inherent economic characteristics of an investment\", including \"the commitment of resources to the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.\"21 The Respondent also cites the five-fold \"litmus test\" for an investment, as advanced in *Salini v Morocco22* (under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention). The Respondent further asserts that the 2004 US Model BIT has clarified the definition of \"investment\" so as to incorporate both legal and economic components, reflecting the criteria suggested in *Pantechniki*.23\n\n*Ibid*., para. 67\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 69-70\n\n*Ibid*., para. 72\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 73-74\n\n3.68.\n\nThe Respondent then proceeds to analyse the settlement agreements in the light of these legal materials; and it concludes that none of them exhibits these essential characteristics of an investment.24 The Respondent makes the following specific points:\n\n(a) Any rights created by the 1994 MOU were superseded by the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and accordingly such rights did not exist when the BIT entered into force in 1997;25\n\n(b) In response to the Claimants' assertion that the release granted by the 1995 Settlement Agreement has significant economic value, the Respondent submits that the purpose of the release was not to carry out any investment activity, nor to dispose of any investment, but only to release TexPet from claims made by the Respondent or PetroEcuador arising from environmental pollution. Similarly, in response to the Claimants' reliance on the amount of about US$ 38 million expended on remediation projects, the Respondent submits that the Claimants were only remedying their own tortious wrongs; and, accordingly, these were compensatory payments and not an investment;26\n\n(c) In relation to the Municipal and Provincial Releases, the Respondent's primary response is that neither the Respondent nor PetroEcuador were parties to these agreements. In any event, the Respondent asserts that the payments made by the Claimants thereunder have none of the essential characteristics of any investment;27 and\n\n(d) As to the 1998 Final Release, the Respondent submits that it was merely an acknowledgement by the Respondent that TexPet had fully performed its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It did not have the essential characteristics of any investment. Although equipment was transferred by TexPet under the 1998 Final Release, it was made free of charge; and such transfer is in any event unrelated to the Claimants' claims.28\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 74\n\n*Ibid*., para. 77\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 79-82\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 84\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 86-88\n\n3.69.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, even if the settlement agreements were technically capable of constituting an \"investment\" under the BIT, Chevron has no interest in any of those agreements because it was neither a party to nor a beneficiary under any such agreements.\n\n3.70.\n\nThe Respondent criticises, in particular, the Claimants' reliance on paragraph 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, which defines the \"Releasees\" covered by that agreement as: \"Texpet, Texaco Petroleum Company, Compania Texaco de Petroleos del Ecuador. S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees, officers, directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs, administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals and subsidiaries.\" The Respondent submits that the Claimants' characterisation of Chevron as TexPet's \"principal\" is misplaced because it is based on Chevron's indirect shareholding in TexPet, rather than on any relationship of principal and agent between Chevron and TexPet, as here required.29\n\n*Ibid.*, at para. 94\n\n3.71.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent notes that, elsewhere in other litigation, Chevron has consistently denied any agency relationship with TexPet.30 The Respondent further contends that, even if there were an agency relationship between Chevron and TexPet following the 2001 merger, there could have been no agency relationship in relation to TexPet's operations which caused environmental damage, since those operations ended in 1992, some nine years before the merger between Texaco and Chevron.31\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 85\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 97\n\n3.72.\n\n*(ii) Article VI(1)(a):* The Respondent rejects the Claimants' characterisation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as an \"investment agreement\". The Respondent acknowledges that the BIT does not contain any definition of \"investment agreement\". However, the Respondent relies on the definition in the 2004 US Model BIT. In the light of this definition, the Respondent asserts that, as a matter of common sense, an agreement to release TexPet from claims concerning the environmental impact of its former operations cannot be an agreement upon which the \"investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment.\"32\n\n*Ibid.*, at paras. 101-102\n\n3.73.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the 1995 Settlement Agreement did not establish any investment: it was a closing agreement dealing with alleged torts and environmental pollution claims against TexPet.33 Further, the Respondent submits that it was entered into three years after the ending of TexPet's participation in the Consortium.34\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 102\n\n*Ibid.*, at para. 105\n\n3.74.\n\nIn any event, so the Respondent submits, Chevron is unable to invoke the 1995 Settlement Agreement, for the purposes of Article VI(1)(a), because it is neither a party to or named as a beneficiary in the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Chevron's dispute with the Respondent cannot therefore relate to an \"investment agreement\" between them.35 The Respondent relies on the awards in *Burlington*, *Duke Energy* and *EnCana* in support of its contention that Article VI(1)(a) requires an investment agreement between the claimant Investor and the respondent State.36\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 107\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 109-110\n\n3.75.\n\n*(iii) Prima Facie Case:* The Respondent next contends that neither of the Claimants can establish any case on the merits of their claims, still less any case satisfying the prima facie standard applicable to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. In relation to Chevron, the Respondent again submits that Chevron is not a party to the settlement agreements. In relation to TexPet, the Respondent asserts that the dispute before the Tribunal does not implicate TexPet in any way because TexPet is not a defendant in the *Lago Agrio* litigation; and therefore that Texpet cannot be prejudiced by any of the alleged acts or omissions of the Respondent in regard to that litigation.37 The Respondent further denies that TexPet can assert any claim on Chevron's behalf.38\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 113\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 127-128\n\n3.76.\n\nMoreover, so the Respondent submits, the settlement agreements do not contain the rights that the Claimants allege in their claims. In particular, none of those agreements imposes on the Respondent any obligation to intervene in private litigation by other third parties.39 The Respondent further submits that any waiver of third party rights by the Respondent would be contrary to Ecuadorian law so that, even if the named parties had intended the 1995 Settlement Agreement to include such a waiver, it would have been a legal nullity.40\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 114\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 133\n\n3.77.\n\nIn relation to the prima facie standard to be applied by the Tribunal, the Respondent submits that: (i) the Claimants must satisfy the Tribunal that jurisdiction is established for each provision of the BIT on which they rely;41 (ii) the Claimants' characterisation of their claims is not definitive: the Tribunal must analyse objectively the basis for its jurisdiction;42 and (iii) the prima facie standard does not require the Tribunal to accept as true the facts alleged by the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration.43\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 116\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 117\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 117\n\n3.78.\n\nThe Respondent notes the elaboration of the prima facie standard in *Joy Mining v Egypt* and *Continental Casualty* in support of its contention that this Tribunal should not necessarily accept the Claimants' pleaded facts as true, but, rather, that the Tribunal should decide whether the Respondent has shown that the Claimants' claims have no factual basis, even on a preliminary scrutiny.44 In the light of these legal materials, the Respondent submits that, since it disputes the existence of the contractual rights on which the Claimants rely, the Tribunal must first determine \"in a definitive manner the exact composition or extent of the investment and investment agreement asserted by the Claimants\".45\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 117-118\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 120\n\n3.79.\n\n*(iv) The Fork in the Road:* The Respondent submits that the Claimants are precluded, by the fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT, from pursuing their claims in this arbitration because that the Claimants have elected to pursue claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Release in an alternative forum.\n\n3.80.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, in determining whether a claimant has triggered a fork in the road provision, a tribunal must consider whether the claims asserted in the two actions have the same \"fundamental basis\".46 The Respondent submits that, in a situation where a claim in a local court is contract-based and a claim in an arbitration is treaty-based, a tribunal should only exercise jurisdiction where the \"fundamental basis\" of the contract and treaty claims are different. With this approach, the Respondent asserts that if the treaty claim is based on a contractual violation, that may trigger a fork in the road provision.47\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 141\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 144\n\n3.81.\n\nApplied to the present case, the Respondent contends that, in order to procure the dismissal of the *Aguinda* litigation in the US Courts, Texaco (with TexPet and Chevron) expressly committed itself to submit to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts in relation to claims arising out of the same events and occurrences alleged in the *Aguinda* litigation and only to challenge any judgment of the Ecuadorian Courts at the enforcement stage.48 According to the Respondent, the *Lago Agrio* litigation, as brought in the Ecuadorian Courts, is a continuation of the *Aguinda* litigation.49 The Respondent submits that Chevron relies in the *Lago Agrio* litigation on the same alleged releases under the settlement agreements as Texaco had asserted in the *Aguinda* litigation; and the Ecuadorian courts have therefore been requested by Chevron to determine the scope of these settlement agreements.50\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 148-151\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 153\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 155-158\n\n3.82.\n\nThe Respondent next submits that the Claimants' claims under the BIT in this arbitration, although pleaded in the form of treaty-based claims, are ultimately based on contractual rights which the Claimants purport to have acquired under the settlement agreements; and, therefore, that the Claimants' treaty claims have the same \"fundamental basis\" as those at issue in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.51 The Respondent accordingly submits that, having elected to submit to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian courts and not to challenge any judgments until the enforcement stage, the Claimants are prevented by the fork in the road provision in the BIT from bringing what is, in effect, a \"pre-judgment collateral attack\" on the *Lago Agrio* litigation.52\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 159-160\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 165\n\n3.83.\n\n*(v) Third Party Rights:* The Respondent asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the Claimants' claims because it would be required to determine the rights of non-parties, contrary to the legal principles established by the International Court of Justice in *Monetary Gold*.53\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 169\n\n3.84.\n\nThe Respondent contends that: the \"Claimants' central claim is predicated upon their contention that Chevron is not liable for any of the environmental impact at issue in the Lago Agrio litigation...\";54 and on this basis, it is asserted that the rights of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are squarely placed at issue in the Claimants' claims before this Tribunal. The Respondent contends therefore that it would be impossible for this Tribunal to decide the Claimants' rights without also deciding the rights of third parties, i.e. the rights of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs who are not parties to nor represented in these arbitration proceedings.55\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 168\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 171\n\n3.85.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the awards in *Larsen v Hawaiian Kingdom* and *Costa Rica v Nicaragua* in support of its contention that the *Monetary Gold* principle is not confined to legal proceedings before the International Court of Justice or arbitrations between States.56\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 179-180\n\n3.86.\n\n*Jurisdictional Relief Sought by the Respondent:* In the light of its several objections, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to grant the formal jurisdictional relief pleaded as follows:\n\n*(i) \"Find and declare that jurisdiction is lacking over all claims raised by*\n\n*Claimants and dismiss all claims, in accordance with the Republic's Objections to Jurisdiction above\";*\n\n*(ii) \"Order, pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Claimants to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the Republic's legal representation, plus pre-award and post-award interest thereon\"; and*\n\n*(iii) \"Grant any other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the circumstances or as may otherwise be just and proper.\"57*\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 182\n\n***(D) The Claimants' Response***\n---------------------------------\n\n3.87.\n\nOn 6 September 2010, the Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n3.88.\n\n*Preliminary Statement:* In their Counter-Memorial, the Claimants at the outset describe the \"Crude\" film outtakes, as providing: \"overwhelming evidence... as to the fraudulent nature of the Lago Agrio litigation.\"58 The Claimants contend that these outtakes demonstrate that the Respondent is actively colluding with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs in that litigation and also in the related criminal proceedings brought against Chevron's two lawyers (Messrs Veiga and P\u00e9rez) in order to undermine Chevron's rights under the settlement agreements. The Claimants submit that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections must be seen by the Tribunal in that particular context.59\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, at para. 2\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 8\n\n3.89.\n\nThe Claimants also highlight the \"opportunistic\" nature of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. In particular, it is asserted that the Respondent is seeking to have it \"both ways\": by insisting here that Chevron is a stranger to TexPet's investments for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings, whilst in the *Lago Agrio* litigation, by ensuring there that Chevron is legally liable for TexPet's alleged operations in Ecuador.60\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 10\n\n3.90.\n\nThe Claimants further characterise the Respondent's arguments as being entirely based on \"the alleged lack of a legal connection between this dispute and the Claimants' investment\".61 The Claimants reject these arguments, asserting that the remediation, infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, together with their rights and obligations under the settlement agreements are \"inextricably intertwined with TexPet's underlying oil exploration and production activities.\"62 The Claimants contend that this dispute concerns \"rights and obligations that are applicable to an investor as a consequence of an investment agreement entered into with that host state\", a category of claims which (so the Claimants submit) the tribunal in *Amco v Indonesia* held would fall within Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.63\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 11\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 12\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 13\n\n3.91.\n\n*Response to Jurisdictional Objections:* The Claimants approach the issues raised by the Respondent in a different order, commencing with their submissions on the general standard to be applied by this Tribunal to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. The Claimants next contend that the Respondent's objections must fail on the basis that the findings in the award in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* are res judicata, or at least highly persuasive, for this Tribunal. The Claimants then submit that both TexPet and Chevron have standing to enforce the settlement agreements, before addressing seriatim the Respondent's objections based on ratione materiae, the BIT's fork in the road provision and third party rights.\n\n3.92.\n\n*(i) The Prima Facie Standard:* The Claimants assert that it is a well-established principle of international law, applicable to investment arbitrations, that the scope of inquiry at the jurisdictional stage is limited to the question whether the claimant's allegations, if true, could constitute a violation of the treaty or other agreement at issue.64\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 23 and 28\n\n3.93.\n\nThe Claimants notes paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Oil Platforms* and contend that this elaboration of the prima facie standard has been adopted in a large number of investment dispute arbitration awards, including *Noble Energy v Ecuador* and *Impregilo v Pakistan*.65 The Claimants emphasise that the tribunal in *Impregilo*, after conducting an extensive review of the jurisprudence, concluded that the prima facie approach balances \"the dual concerns of ensuring that the merits are not prejudiced and preventing abusive claims from proceeding...\"66\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 24-25\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 27\n\n3.94.\n\nHaving set out the prima facie standard to be applied by the Tribunal, the Claimants next submit that their claims satisfy that standard. The Claimants highlight, in particular, the fact that this Tribunal has already issued provisional measures (i.e. its order of 14 May 2010) and emphasise that: \"the establishment of a prima facie case on the merits is a prerequisite for the issuance of provisional measures.\"67\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 29\n\n3.95.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's objection that TexPet cannot make out a prima facie case because it is not a party to the *Lago Agrio* litigation, the Claimants assert that this factor is not necessary for the existence of a dispute between TexPet and the Respondent under the BIT. The Claimants also submit that it would have made no sense for TexPet to expend US$ 40 million under the 1995 Settlement Agreement if it was not entitled to protect both itself and its affiliated companies from similar claims.68 It is also contended that the Respondent has damaged TexPet's own treaty and contract rights by the Respondent's failure to honour its obligations under the settlement agreements. The Claimants argue that the Respondent should not be entitled to circumvent TexPet's rights by having Chevron (and not also TexPet) named as a defendant in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.69\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 32\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 33\n\n3.96.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent's arguments that the contractual rights asserted by the Claimants do not exist under the settlement agreements and would, in any case, be impermissible under Ecuadorian law, the Claimants contend that these arguments go to the merits of the Parties' dispute and cannot properly be decided at this jurisdictional phase. However, the Claimants also note, when the Respondent entered into these settlement agreements, that it specifically represented the people of Ecuador in relation to the same legal rights which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs later asserted in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.70\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 34\n\n3.97.\n\n*(ii) Res Judicata/Issue Preclusion:* The Claimants submit that the Respondents' objections to jurisdiction have already been decided between these same parties, involving the same BIT and under the same arbitration agreement incorporating the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, in the interim award issued in the *Commercial Cases Dispute;* and that such decisions are accordingly res judicata before this Tribunal.71 In particular, that tribunal in its interim award determined that litigation concerning the liquidation and settlement of claims relating to an investment constitute part of that investment; and that the investment in Ecuador continued to exist after the expiry of the 1973 Concession Agreement in 1992.72\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 36\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 37\n\n3.98.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the question of res judicata should be governed by international law on the basis (inter alia) that the effect of a tribunal's decision made in an investment treaty-based arbitration should not depend upon the domestic law of that arbitration's seat. It is further emphasised that Article VI(6) of the BIT provides that any arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Parties.73 The Claimants rely on the approach of tribunals in *Waste Management Inc v Mexico* and *Amco v Indonesia* in support of the contention that international tribunals have adopted a broad approach to res judicata, and that on the basis of that broad approach, the decisions of the tribunal in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* constitute res judicata in this arbitration.74\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 38\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 40\n\n3.99.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the Respondent's submission that the res judicata effect of the *Commercial Cases Dispute* should be governed by Dutch law (as the law of the seat);75 and they also contend that, in any event and contrary to the Respondent's submission, that tribunal's decision in an interim award would still be res judicata as a matter of Dutch law as the law of the seat of that arbitration. The Claimants note that the tribunal's partial award on the merits incorporates all the jurisdictional determinations from their interim award on jurisdiction; that the Respondent has brought legal proceedings to set aside the interim award; and that, under Dutch law, such an application may not be brought until an award has acquired the force of res judicata under Dutch law *.76*\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 39\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 39\n\n3.100.\n\n*(iii) Privity and Non-Parties:* The Claimants reject the Respondents' argument that their claims cannot constitute an investment dispute under Article VI of the BIT because TexPet is not a party to the *Lago Agrio* litigation and Chevron is not a party to the settlement agreements. In submitting that both Claimants have standing to enforce these settlement agreements and assert claims under the BIT, the Claimants make the following four principal points.\n\n3.101.\n\nFirst, Chevron has independent standing to enforce the 1995 Settlement Agreement because it falls within the categories of parties described as \"Releasees\" in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Claimants assert, in particular, that the word \"principales\" in the Spanish text of Article 5.1 should be construed as \"parent corporation\" and include Chevron as TexPet's parent. The Claimants contend that this interpretation is supported by the fact that, in the Spanish text, the word \"principales\" is expressly linked with the word \"subsidiarias\".77 More generally, the Claimants assert that the lengthy list of Releasees in Article 5.1 indicates that the parties intended to release any and all parties who could potentially be sued under any theory of law.78 The Claimants further contend that the parties intended third party releasees to be able to enforce the releases. The Claimants reject the Respondent's reliance on Article 9.5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (said to preclude all third party beneficiaries) on the basis that it would render the express release language meaningless and unenforceable.79\n\n*Ibid*., para. 49\n\n*Ibid*., para. 52\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 54-56\n\n3.102.\n\nSecond, Chevron has standing as TexPet's shareholder, under the BIT, to enforce claims on behalf of TexPet. The Claimants contend that the express language of Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT makes clear that an indirect owner of an investment is protected under the BIT. The Claimants cite in support Professor Vandevelde's explanation that Article 1(1) of the 2004 US Model BIT was intended to protect investors against the effect of *Barcelona Traction*.80 It is further contended that arbitration tribunals, including *AAPL v Sri Lanka, AMT v Zaire, Genin v Estonia* and *CMS v Argentina* have consistently adopted the same approach.81 The Claimants also cite the decision of the tribunal in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* that it had jurisdiction over TexPet and Chevron's claims against the Respondent.82\n\n*Ibid*., para 62\n\n*Ibid*., para. 65\n\n*Ibid*., para. 74\n\n3.103.\n\nThird, TexPet has standing to enforce its rights under the settlement agreements. The Claimants rely on the provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code in support of their argument that TexPet is entitled to enforce its contractual rights even if the alleged breach affects non-parties to those agreements.83 The Claimants emphasise that TexPet provided substantial consideration in return for the release of both TexPet and its affiliates from liability. To the extent that the Respondent disputes the Claimants' interpretation of the scope of the release, the Claimants assert that such dispute is a matter on which TexPet has the right to seek a binding interpretation from this Tribunal as a matter relating to the merits of the Parties' dispute.84\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 77-79\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 81\n\n3.104.\n\nFourth, the Respondent's position violates legal principles of good faith, including estoppel and preclusion. The Claimants contend that the Respondent is \"blowing hot and cold\" in that it has affirmed jurisdiction over Chevron based on TexPet's alleged conduct in the *Lago Agrio* litigation; but that the Respondent simultaneously seeks to deny that this Tribunal has any jurisdiction over Chevron on the basis that it is a stranger to TexPet's investment and investment agreement.85 The Claimants further submit that the Lago Agrio Court has asserted de facto jurisdiction over Chevron for more than seven years; and that this constitutes a clear statement by the Respondent that Chevron is responsible for conduct arising out of the investment.86 Citing *SPP v Egypt*, the Claimants also assert that the Respondent's conduct in asserting jurisdiction over Chevron in the *Lago Agrio* litigation has forced Chevron to incur significant litigation expenses and to commence the present arbitration as a claimant in order to prevent the Respondent from taking a contrary course of action.87 The Claimants also rely on the international law doctrine of preclusion, which (so it asserts) is broader than the doctrine of estoppel and, in particular, does not require detrimental reliance.88\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 82\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 85\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 86\n\n*Ibid.*, at para. 90\n\n3.105.\n\n*(iv) Article VI(1)(c):* In contending that there is an alleged breach of the BIT \"with respect to an investment\" for the purposes of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, the Claimants advance two principal submissions.\n\n3.106.\n\nFirst, the Claimants advance a \"holistic\" approach to the identification of an \"investment\", contending that the concession agreements, TexPet's underlying exploration and production activities and the settlement agreements are all inextricably entwined as an investment.89 The Claimants emphasise the scale of the original investment and the economic benefits conferred on the Respondent.90 The Claimants contend that this holistic approach was envisaged by the settlement agreements, all of which expressly recognise that TexPet's remediation, infrastructure and socio-economic activities arose directly out of its underlying oil exploration and production activities.91\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 101\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 105\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 110-114\n\n3.107.\n\nThe Claimants further assert that this \"holistic\" approach is supported by arbitral jurisprudence. Particular reliance is placed on the tribunal's decision in *Mondev*, that \"once an investment exists, it remains protected by NAFTA even after the enterprise in question may have failed... Issues of orderly liquidation and the settlement of claims may still arise and require [international legal protection]...\"92 The Claimants assert that this reasoning was adopted in the *Commercial Cases Dispute*, in which the tribunal determined that the Claimants' lawsuits constituted part of their investment.93 The Claimants further highlight a number of other arbitral awards in support of the \"holistic\" or \"unity of the investment\" approach, from *Holiday Inns v Morocco* to *Inmaris v Ukraine*.94 In the light of these legal materials, the Claimants conclude that the remediation activities, with the rights and obligations under the settlement agreements, are \"component parts of a larger, integrated investment undertaking\"95; and that, when viewed as an overall \"adventure\", they clearly qualify as an investment for the purpose of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.96\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 120\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 123\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 128-133\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 134\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 135\n\n3.108.\n\nSecond, in the alternative, the Claimants contend that, even if the settlement agreements are viewed independently of TexPet's original investment, these agreements qualify as a \"stand alone\" investment. The Claimants emphasise that the definition of \"investment\" in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT is expansive, covering \"every kind of investment\".97 The Claimants submit that arbitral jurisprudence, including *Tradex v Albania, Fedax v Venezuela* and *SGS v Philippines*, supports their contention that definitions of \u2018investment' in BITs should be construed broadly.98\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 141\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 144-147\n\n3.109.\n\nAdopting this broad approach, the Claimants contend that their investments in Ecuador fall within at least three of the separate examples of \"investments\" listed in Article I(1) of the BIT, namely: (i) \"investment contracts\" under Article I(1)(a); (ii) \"a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value\" under Article I(1)(a)(iii); and (iii) \"any right conferred by law or contract\" under Article I(1)(a)(v).99\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 148\n\n3.110.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that the settlement agreements do not bear any of the intrinsic economic characteristics of an investment, contending that the effect of that argument is to impose jurisdictional requirements which do not appear in the BIT.100 In relation to the legal materials invoked by the Respondent, the Claimants contend that the tribunal in *Salini* decided that the contract there at issue constituted an investment for the purposes of that BIT; but that the four independent criteria were elaborated in the context of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention which (so that tribunal decided) required it to go beyond the consent of the parties under the BIT itself.101 The Claimants emphasise that the *Salini* test has been the subject of extended criticism, notably in *Biwater v Tanzania.102* The Claimants note that the second award invoked by the Respondent, *Pantechniki*, was again an ICSID decision; the Claimants assert that the definition of \"investment\" for the purposes of that BIT was not there at issue; and the tribunal expressed caution against applying additional jurisdictional requirements not found in the BIT's text.103 Finally, in relation to *Romak v Uzbekistan*, the Claimants acknowledge that the tribunal there appeared to import a Salini-like test, but they contend that this was made in the context of a one-off commercial contract; and it thus should be distinguished from the present case.104\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 156\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 158\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 160\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 168-170\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 171\n\n3.111.\n\nThe Claimants further note that the 2004 US Model BIT (which the Respondent also invokes in support of its argument) is not phrased in terms of \"expectation of a commercial profit\", but rather an \"expectation of gain or profit\". The Claimants submit that the word \"gain\" is deliberately broader, and may include non-monetary benefits, such as a release from alleged liability under the settlement agreements.105\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 175\n\n3.112.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimants submit, even if the narrow test advanced by the Respondent were correct, the settlement agreements are capable of constituting a \"stand-alone\" investment. In particular, the Claimants assert that a substantial financial contribution was made under the terms of those agreements; there was an element of risk (in that the remediation works could have cost far more than anticipated); the remediation works were conducted over a period of four years; and there was an expectation of gain in the form of the benefits from the release.106\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 178-181\n\n3.113.\n\n*(v) Article VI(1)(a):* The Claimants assert that they are entitled to bring claims before this Tribunal in respect of alleged breaches of the settlement agreements in accordance with Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, in addition to their claims for breach of the substantive provisions of the BIT with respect to an investment under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.107\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 185\n\n3.114.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims on two separate and independent grounds: (i) the Parties' dispute \"relates to\" the concession agreements, which are and have already been held elsewhere to be \"investment agreements\" under Article VI(1)(a); and (ii) the settlement agreements themselves constitute \"investment agreements\" under Article VI(1)(a) on the basis that they are agreements concerning the Claimants' continuing investment in Ecuador.108\n\n*Ibid*,. at para. 185\n\n3.115.\n\nAs to the first ground, the Claimants stress that Article I(1)(a) expressly refers to disputes \"arising out of or relating to\" an investment agreement. It is submitted that the use of the disjunctive word \"or\" indicates that \"arising out of\" and \"relating to\" have different meanings. In the Claimants' submission, the phrase \"arising out of\" indicates that the investment agreement itself provides the basis of the cause of action, whereas the phrase \"relating to\" requires only that the dispute has a reasonable or legally significant connection with the investment agreement.109\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 192\n\n3.116.\n\nThe Claimants here rely on the *Commercial Cases Dispute*, where the tribunal held that the wording of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT was broad enough to cover a denial of justice claim which \u2018related to' the original concession agreements.110 The Claimants also highlight the approach of the English Court of Appeal in *Occidental Exploration v Ecuador 2007* and of the NAFTA tribunal in *Methanex v United States*, both of which (so the Claimants contend) support a broad interpretation of the phrase \"relating to *\"111*.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 194\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 195-196\n\n3.117.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants submit that the Parties' dispute is legally and factually intertwined with the original concession agreements. It is argued that \"but for\" those concession agreements, TexPet would not have conducted oil operations in Ecuador and (allegedly) caused the environmental damage which is the foundation of the *Lago Agrio* litigation.112 The Claimants further assert that the factual materials in this case go beyond a mere \"but for\" relationship with the original concession agreements. It is noted by the Claimants, in particular, that the 1995 Settlement Agreement expressly provides for the release of TexPet's contractual obligations under those concession agreements;113 and that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs specifically allege that TexPet violated its obligations under the 1973 Concession Agreement.114\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 198\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 199\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 201\n\n3.118.\n\nAs to the second ground, the Claimants reject the Respondent's contention that the phrase \"investment agreement\" requires an agreement under which the Claimants established or acquired their investment in Ecuador. On the contrary, it is asserted that the text, object and purpose of the BIT make clear that \"investment agreement\" should be interpreted broadly. The Claimants highlight, in particular, a distinction in the BIT's Spanish text between the phrase \"agreement of investment\" and the broader phrase \"agreement concerning an investment\" which is used in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT.115 The Claimants assert that, on its plain meaning, the phrase \"investment agreement\" encompasses any agreement concerning an investment; and that it is not limited to an agreement which relates to the establishment, management, operation, maintenance or disposal of an investment.116\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 205\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 206\n\n3.119.\n\nIn the Claimants' submission, this broad interpretation of \"investment agreement\" is supported by the drafting history of US BITs. The Claimants recount that, whilst the US-Ecuador BIT was based on the 1992 US Model BIT, none of the pre-1994 US Model BITs contained a definition of \"investment agreement\". The Claimants cite Professor Vandevelde's commentary on the 1983 US Model BIT to the effect that the intention behind this phrase was to exclude ordinary commercial contracts.117 The Claimants also cite the US-Russia BIT (concluded shortly before the US-Ecuador BIT), which does contain a definition of \"investment agreement\" expressly covering agreements \"concerning an investment\".118 Conversely, the Claimants reject the Respondent's reliance on the 2004 US Model BIT because it post-dates the BIT here at issue and because its new definition of \"investment agreement\" (according to Professor Vandevelde's commentary) was not intended to be simply a clarification of existing US Model BITs, but represented a revision.119\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 211\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 212\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 213\n\n3.120.\n\nThe Claimants distinguish other legal materials, *PSEG Global Inc v Turkey* and *El Paso v Argentina*, which are invoked by the Respondent in support of its narrow interpretation of the phrase \"investment agreement\". The Claimants assert that its meaning was not actually at issue in these cases.120 On the contrary, so the Claimants submit, other legal materials (including *Noble Ventures* and *Occidental v Ecuador 2005*) indicate that the term \"investment agreement\" is used to refer generally to agreements between a foreign investor and a host State.121\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 220-221\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 217-218\n\n3.121.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants submit that the settlement agreements qualify as \"investment agreements\" under this broader interpretation of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. In any event, so the Claimants contend, even on the Respondent's narrow interpretation, these agreements still qualify as investment agreements because the remediation work undertaken by TexPet under those agreements constitutes an \"investment\" for the purposes of Article I(1) of the BIT; and accordingly the settlement agreements must be \"investment agreements\".122\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 227\n\n3.122.\n\nThe Claimants next address the Respondent's argument that, even if the Tribunal were to have jurisdiction over TexPet, it cannot have jurisdiction over Chevron because Chevron was not a party to the settlement agreements. In response, the Claimants rely on two separate submissions; namely: (i) arbitral jurisprudence and general principles of international law confirm that Chevron can invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under the BIT on the basis that it is a covered party or a third party beneficiary of the settlement agreements; and (ii) the Respondent is estopped or otherwise precluded from objecting to the Tribunal's jurisdiction because Chevron would not have brought this arbitration were it not for the Lago Agrio Court's wrongful assumption of jurisdiction over Chevron.\n\n3.123.\n\nAs to the first submission, the Claimants contend that in both *Burlington v Ecuador* and *Duke Energy v Ecuador* (invoked by the Respondent), the tribunals accepted that the requirement that an \"investment agreement\" should be \"between\" the claimant and respondent State is satisfied where the agreement confers enforceable rights on the claimant, whether or not they are a signatory to such agreement. In neither case did the parent company have any enforceable rights under the agreement between its subsidiary and the respondent State.123 Further, the Claimants submit that, in both common law and civil law jurisdictions, courts and tribunals have decided that a third party beneficiary may invoke an arbitration clause in a contract to which it was not a signatory.124\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 231\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 232\n\n3.124.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the object and purpose of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT is to promote efficiency in the resolution of investment disputes by allowing investors to bring contractual claims in the same arbitral forum as their treaty claims. It is submitted that a third party beneficiary's rights under an investment agreement would qualify as an \"investment\" and that a tribunal would therefore have jurisdiction over that third party's treaty based claims pursuant to Article I(1)(c) of the BIT. The Claimants therefore submit that, consistent with the object and purpose of Article VI(1)(a), this tribunal should have jurisdiction over a third party's contractual claims.125\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 232\n\n3.125.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that Chevron is clearly a third party beneficiary under the settlement agreements,126and that it therefore possesses its own enforceable rights and can invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to enforce those rights in these arbitration proceedings under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.127\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 233\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 234\n\n3.126.\n\n*(vi) Third Party Rights:* The Claimants distinguish the *Monetary Gold* case (invoked by the Respondent). In that case, in order to adjudicate upon the dispute between the United Kingdom and Italy, the International Court of Justice would have been required to determine whether an absent third State (Albania) had committed an internationally wrongful act that would have entitled Italy to claim the gold at issue. In the Claimants' submission, this arbitration is materially different: it concerns only a dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent.128\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 237\n\n3.127.\n\nThe Claimants further seek to confine the scope of the *Monetary Gold* principle to third party States,129 asserting that the principle has never been applied in the context of non-State actors or investor-state arbitrations.130 Moreover, the Claimants submit that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs do not have separate rights which might be affected by this arbitration, but rather that the rights which those plaintiffs seek to assert against Chevron are the same rights which (so the Claimants allege) the Respondent agreed to release in the settlement agreements.131\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 239\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 241\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 239\n\n3.128.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimants submit, to the extent that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs have any interest in this arbitration, that interest can be adequately represented by the Respondent.\n\n3.129.\n\n*(vii) Fork in the Road:* The Claimants submits that the Respondent's argument based on the BIT's fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT is wrong because the Claimants have not submitted their claims in this dispute with the Respondent to any other forum.\n\n3.130.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the plain language of Articles VI(2) & VI(3) of the BIT indicates that the fork in the road provision applies only to investment disputes and, moreover, only to those investment disputes submitted by the national or company concerned.132 In disputing the Respondent's objection, the Claimants make the following specific points.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 245\n\n3.131.\n\nThe \"investment dispute\" before this Tribunal has not been submitted to another forum. The *Lago Agrio* litigation, as the Respondent itself recognises, is not an investment dispute but an environmental damage claim.133 The fact that another dispute submitted to a domestic court can relate to an investment or an investment agreement is not sufficient to convert it into an \"investment dispute\" for the purposes of a fork in the road provision.134 The Claimants cite *Olgu\u00edn v Paraguay* and *Genin v Estonia* in support of their contention that a fork in the road provision will not be triggered by domestic legal proceedings which are related (but not identical) to the dispute before the arbitration tribunal.135\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 248\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 249\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 250-253\n\n3.132.\n\nThe dispute before this Tribunal has not been submitted by the Claimants to another forum. Defensive conduct by a party taken in domestic legal proceedings does not trigger a fork in the road provision. The Claimants, citing *Enron v Argentina* and *CMS v Argentina,* contend that a fork in the road provision contemplates situations where a claimant has a choice whether to submit a dispute to arbitration or another forum. Where the investor is defending proceedings brought in a domestic court, it does not have a choice and therefore a fork in the road provision is inapplicable.136 The Claimants accordingly submit that in taking defensive steps in the *Aguinda* litigation, Chevron was not exercising a choice but was \"pulled into\" the dispute by the Aguinda plaintiffs.137 In any event, the Claimants deny that the *Lago Agrio* litigation is a continuation of the *Aguinda* litigation; and the fact that Texaco secured a forum non conveniens dismissal of the *Aguinda* litigation cannot amount to a voluntary submission of the present dispute by Chevron to the *Lago Agrio* litigation.138\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 257\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 258\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 259\n\n3.133.\n\nThe Claimants did not make any exclusive forum selection. It is asserted that, whatever statements were made by Texaco, they cannot bind the Claimants, and were, in any event, related to an entirely different dispute that that at issue in the *Lago Agrio* litigation or the present arbitration.139 The Claimants further submit that any statements made by Texaco were premised on the basis of appropriate treatment by the Respondent's Courts in accordance with the rule of law and international standards.140 Further, even if Texaco had made such an agreement, that is not sufficient to trigger a fork in the road provision: in *Lanco v Argentina*, the tribunal held that only the actual filing of a claim is sufficient to constitute a choice for the purpose of applying a fork in the road provision.\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 260-261\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 263\n\n3.134.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's reliance on a \"fundamental basis\" test, the Claimants' primary response is that this is legally irrelevant because the Respondent has failed to establish the basic requirements of the BIT's fork in the road provision.141 The Claimants also dispute the Respondent's characterisation of that test, in particular its reliance on the *Pantechniki* decision. The Claimants assert that *Pantechniki* departs from a long line of decisions which holds that treaty claims are fundamentally different from contract claims.142 Moreover, in *Pantechniki*, the dispute submitted to the domestic court was undoubtedly an investment dispute.143 The Claimants also reject the Respondent's argument that this Tribunal will have to carry out an identical analysis to that required in the *Lago Agrio* litigation. The Claimants highlight, in particular, that the Parties' dispute in this arbitration includes allegations of breaches under the substantive provisions of the BIT, which are not at issue in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.144\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 266-267\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 266\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 269\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 270\n\n3.135.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's attempt to portray the Claimants' claims as being essentially contractual claims dressed up as treaty claims should be rejected by the Tribunal. In the Claimants' submission, the Respondent's approach would effectively require, wrongly, the Tribunal to determine at this jurisdictional stage the merits of the Claimants' claims for breach of the substantive provisions of the BIT.145\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 272\n\n3.136.\n\n*Jurisdictional Relief Sought by the Claimants:* In the light of its submissions, the Claimants requests the following formal jurisdictional relief from the Tribunal:\n\n*(i) \"A declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction and competence of this Tribunal\";*\n\n*(ii) \"An order dismissing all of Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction and competence of the Tribunal\"; and*\n\n*(iii) \"An order that Respondent pay the costs of this proceedings, including the Tribunal's fees and expenses, and the costs of Claimants' representation, along with interest\".146*\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 275\n\n***(E) The Respondent's Reply***\n--------------------------------\n\n3.137.\n\nOn 6 October 2010, the Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections.\n\n3.138.\n\n*Introduction:* In its introductory remarks, the Respondent describes the Claimants' claims as an attempt to \"transform what is fundamentally a private environmental dispute into an \u2018investment dispute' against a sovereign\".147 The Respondent suggests that the Claimants have attempted to divert attention from the demerits of their case \"by cobbling together a list of inflammatory allegations \u2026\", principally by reference the outtakes from the film \"Crude\".148 The Respondent submits that these allegations could be addressed in detail at the merits stage; but, for the purposes of its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' allegations relate not to the Respondent but, rather, to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs;149 and that those allegations (even if true) have no relevance to this arbitration.150 The Respondent further denies that the \"Crude\" film outtakes provide any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Respondent and the *Lago Agrio* plaintiffs.151\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections, at para. 6\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 15\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 16\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 17\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 19\n\n3.139.\n\n*Reply to the Claimants' Response:* The Respondent then addresses, first, the standard of review which should be applied by this Tribunal to the Claimants' claims at this jurisdictional stage, before next developing its submissions on jurisdiction ratione materiae under Article VI(1(c) and Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. The Respondent then responds to the Claimants' arguments on the res judicata effect of the *Commercial Cases Dispute*, the scope of the *Monetary Gold* principle in relation to third party rights and the BIT's fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT.\n\n3.140.\n\n*(i) The Standard of Review:* The Respondent reiterates its submission that the prima facie test does not require the Tribunal to accept as true all the facts alleged by the Claimants in their Notice of Arbitration.152 In particular, so the Respondent asserts, tribunals frequently allow the respondent to adduce evidence to show that the claimant's case has no factual basis.153 The Respondent cites the *Micula* decision as demonstrating that, where a jurisdictional issue is dependent on a factual determination, the tribunal must make that factual determination to the extent necessary for jurisdictional purposes.154\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 23\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 23\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 24\n\n3.141.\n\nThe Respondent denies that any of its jurisdictional objections requires the Tribunal to make any inappropriate determination as to the merits of the Parties' dispute. For instance, the objection that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over TexPet's claims because it is not a party to the *Lago Agrio* litigation requires a \"determination that is purely jurisdictional\";155 and it does not require the Tribunal to address issues as to the merits, such as whether the Respondent has breached any substantive obligations owed to TexPet under the BIT.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 25\n\n3.142.\n\nIn relation to the jurisdictional objection based on the lack of any provision in the 1995 Settlement Agreement under which the Respondent undertook to indemnify the Claimants from third party liability, the Respondent acknowledges that this objection might require the Tribunal to examine facts which overlap with the merits of the Claimants' claims; but the Respondent contends that the objection is so obvious that it would be a waste of the Parties' resources to reserve this jurisdictional decision to a merits phase in these arbitration proceedings.156\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 27\n\n3.143.\n\n*(ii) Article VI(1)(c):* The Respondent rejects the Claimants' attempts to establish the existence of an investment dispute relating to an \"investment\" under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, making the following two submissions.\n\n3.144.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot rely for their investment upon any \"inextricable link\" between the expired concession agreements and the later 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n3.145.\n\nUnder the Claimants' \"holistic\" approach to the issue of whether there is an investment and investment dispute, the Respondent submits that a \"fundamental jurisdictional question\" for the Tribunal concerns the nature and quality of the link which is required between the Claimants' alleged dispute under the settlement agreements and TexPet's expired investment under the original concession agreements.157 The Respondent asserts that, in order to cross this jurisdictional threshold, the Claimants must establish that the settlement agreements were \"required to enable, permit, facilitate, or otherwise contribute to TexPet's ability to engage in oil exploration or production activities.\" The Respondent contends that these activities had already expired in 1992.158\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 38\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 38\n\n3.146.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the factual basis for the alleged \"inextricable link\". The Respondent notes that the Claimants highlight the \"magnitude\" of TexPet's original investment. The Respondent denies that this factor has any relevance to the existence of a link between that investment and the settlement agreements.159 In response to the Claimants' assertion that the latter's remediation and socio-economic activities arose directly out of the original concession, the Respondent submits that not only does this run counter to the position which the Claimants have consistently taken, but also that there is nothing in the 1973 Concession Agreement to support this alleged link.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 42\n\n3.147.\n\nThe Respondent refers to section 46 of the 1973 Concession Agreement (upon which the Claimants rely) which merely required TexPet to refrain from polluting the concession area160 and therefore did not anticipate any remediation activities.161 The Respondent also contends that the settlement agreements arose not from anything in the concession agreements, but from environmental audits conducted at the request of the Respondent. The Respondent also notes that TexPet has explicitly acknowledged that its participation in these audits was not required by any law or contractual obligation.162 The Respondent characterises the settlement agreements as a \"contingent liability\"; and it cites *Joy Mining* in support of the proposition that a contingent liability cannot constitute a protected investment under a BIT.163\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 43\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 54\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 45\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 50\n\n3.148.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimants' characterisation of the settlement agreements as being \"a part of the natural winding up of TexPet's expired investment\". The Respondent asserts that the winding up of TexPet's investment had been completed before 1995; and that the relevant claims were third party tort claims which were independent of TexPet's obligations under the concession agreements.164 The Respondent further explains that there is nothing in the language of the 1995 Settlement Agreement to support an \"inextricable link\", as alleged by the Claimants.165 The Respondent asserts that the only argument left to the Claimants is a \"but for\" link: namely that TexPet originally caused the environmental damage which was later remediated under the settlement agreements.166\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 51\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 52-61\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 66\n\n3.149.\n\nAs to this last argument, the Respondent contends the arbitral jurisprudence cited by the Claimants does not supports a \"but for\" approach to establishing the existence of an investment.167 In particular, the Respondent distinguishes the approach in *Mondev,* emphasising that the tribunal was there motivated by an equitable concern that an investor should not lose its right to assert claims under NAFTA in circumstances where its investment had been expropriated.168 The Respondent submits that the present case is different, because the rights invoked by the Claimants do not derive from the expired concession agreements, but from later settlement agreements made in response to the Claimants' contingent liability under Ecuadorian environmental law. The Respondent maintains that *Mondev* does not support the proposition that an investor's potential liability can extend the life of an expired, as opposed to an expropriated, investment.169\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 67\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 72\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 76\n\n3.150.\n\nThe Respondent also distinguishes the decision in the *Commercial Cases Dispute*, principally on the basis that the Claimants' claims in that arbitration were founded on the investors' alleged rights under the original concession agreements.170\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 77\n\n3.151.\n\nIn short, as to this first submission, the Respondent contends that none of the legal materials invoked by the Claimants indicates that a \"holistic\" approach should be applied to the question whether an \"investment\" exists under this BIT, but were rather concerned with other discrete issues.171\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 80-93\n\n3.152.\n\nAs to its second submission, the Respondent contends that the settlement agreements are not stand-alone investments as alleged by the Claimants.\n\n3.153.\n\nThe Respondent specifically rejects the Claimants' suggestion that it is seeking to impose novel jurisdictional requirements; and it seeks to explain that it is simply maintaining that the Claimants have not established that the dispute is with respect to an \"investment\" as required by the BIT.172 The Respondent reiterates that the plain, ordinary, inherent meaning of the word \"investment\" incorporates economic characteristics.173 In the Respondent's view, this is confirmed by the preamble to the BIT, which emphasises that the BIT is designed to \"stimulate the flow of private capital and \u2026 economic development\".174 The Respondent contends that it is not enough for the Claimants simply to point to something that falls within one of the categories in Article I(1)(a), because these categories only describe the legal form which an investment can take.175\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 94, 106\n\n*Ibid*., at paras 95-98\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 99\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 102\n\n3.154.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that it is primarily by ICSID tribunals that the economic characteristics of investments have been analysed, by reference to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. However, the Respondent submits that in the recent decision in *Saba Fakes*, the tribunal considered that the ICSID Convention captures \"the ordinary meaning of the word \"investment\".176 Moreover, in the Respondent's further submission, it would make no sense if the meaning of \"investment\" differed according to a claimant's post hoc choice of arbitral systems between the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the ICSID Convention.177\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 110\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 111\n\n3.155.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates that none of the settlement agreements possesses the necessary economic characteristics of an \"investment\".178 In addressing the Claimants' analysis of these agreements, the Respondent highlights the following factors: (i) the \"contribution\" made by TexPet in its remediation activities was at most \"net-zero\" but was probably \"net-negative\"; (ii) TexPet's activities under the settlement agreements entailed no risk, but on the contrary eliminated any risk to TexPet with immediate effect; (iii) the vast majority of the remediation work was undertaken before the BIT came into effect (in 1997); (iv) TexPet never intended its remediation work to generate a gain in the sense of a return on an investment: the assertion that TexPet \"gained\" a release from liability is legally irrelevant; and (v) TexPet did not contribute to Ecuador's development through the financing of these works because at most the effect of these contributions was \"net-zero\".179\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 114\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 115\n\n3.156.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the Claimants refer throughout their CounterMemorial to the \"Settlement and Release Agreements\". The Respondent submits, however, that the Municipal and Provincial Releases are irrelevant because neither the Respondent nor PetroEcuador was a party to these settlements; and, consequently, the Claimants' claims must depend only upon the 1995 Settlement Agreement.180\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 118\n\n3.157.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent further submits that Chevron has no interest in any of these settlement agreements, including the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n3.158.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Chevron is not a contractually covered beneficiary under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent emphasises that this Settlement Agreement does not include any generic reference to \"parent companies\", but refers only to TexPet's parent at the time, namely Texaco181. The Respondent rejects the Claimants' reliance on the term \"principales\" in the Spanish text, submitting that this is a defined term in the Ecuadorian Commercial Code where it is confined to a \"principal\" under a principal/agent relationship.182 By contrast, Ecuadorian corporate law uses the term \"matriz\" to refer to foreign companies with domestic operations in Ecuador.183\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 119\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 119\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 120\n\n3.159.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the language of the Municipal and Provincial Releases indicates that the Claimants' lawyers were well able to include a term which clearly covered parent corporations in the release when the parties actually intended to do so: those agreements all expressly extend the release to \"any other affiliate, subsidiary or other related companies\u2026\"184 The Respondent further submits that, even if the Spanish word \"principales\" is construed in the manner alleged by the Claimants, it is nonetheless incapable of extending to TexPet's future parent corporations, such as Chevron.185\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 122\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 127\n\n3.160.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants mischaracterise the Respondent's submission based on Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that \"Article 9.4 cannot be interpreted to mean that releasees may not invoke and enforce the releases that the Agreement expressly provides to them.\" However, the Respondent's actual submission is that Chevron is a third party which is not covered by any release as a Releasee and therefore has no right to seek enforcement of a right to which it is not entitled as a non-releasee.186\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 135\n\n3.161.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that Chevron does not have standing to assert claims on behalf of TexPet in this arbitration.\n\n3.162.\n\nThe Respondent submits that arbitral jurisprudence establishes that shareholders only have standing to bring direct claims on their own behalf and, moreover, may only seek relief for the diminution in the value of their stake in the company.187 In support of its submission, the Respondent refers to the legal materials invoked by the Claimants, including *Maffezini v Spain, Azurix v Argentina* and *AMT v Zaire.* The Respondent contends that all these cases concerned claims brought by claimant shareholders on their own behalf.\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 137-138\n\n3.163.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Chevron characterises its indirect ownership of TexPet as an \"investment\" protected under the BIT. The Respondent contends that this new formulation of Chevron's protected investment is impermissible, but that, in any event, Chevron's indirect ownership of TexPet cannot constitute an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT. The Respondent emphasises that TexPet is not incorporated in Ecuador, as required by the BIT.188\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 144-145\n\n3.164.\n\nFurther, the Respondent asserts that Chevron has failed to establish that its indirect interest in TexPet has diminished as a result of the alleged wrongs committed by the Respondent. The Respondent reiterates that TexPet is not being sued as a defendant in the *Lago Agrio* litigation; and therefore, as a non-party, TexPet cannot be adversely affected by the eventual outcome of that litigation.189 The Respondent concludes that Chevron has no investment dispute with the Respondent within the meaning of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 150\n\n3.165.\n\nAs to TexPet, the Respondent contends that it has failed to explain the nature of its alleged dispute with the Respondent. Although TexPet asserts that its rights are \"directly at issue\" in the *Lago Agrio* litigation, the Respondent again emphasises that TexPet is not involved in any way with that litigation; and it is thus difficult to see how TexPet's alleged rights could be directly affected by any of the Respondent's alleged acts or omissions.190 The Respondent submits that the provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (as invoked by the Claimants) cannot be used to establish a dispute between TexPet and the Respondent in circumstances where TexPet is not an injured party.191 The Respondent accordingly submits that TexPet also has no investment dispute with the Respondent within the meaning of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 153\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 154-156\n\n3.166.\n\n*(iii) Article VI(1)(a):* The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae pursuant to Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT for want of any relevant \"investment agreement\", reiterating that neither of the Claimants have established their jurisdictional cases under Article VI(1)(a). Here, the Respondent responds principally to the Claimants' three arguments in support of the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Chevron's claims relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n3.167.\n\nFirst, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' argument that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Chevron under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT on the basis that the settlement agreements are \"related to\" the original concession agreements. The Respondent submits that the Claimants' lengthy submissions on the meaning of the phrase \"relating to\" in Article VI(1)(a) are wrong. The Respondent contends that a dispute \"relating to\" an investment agreement can only qualify as an \"investment dispute\" if the parties to the dispute are the same parties to the relevant investment agreement; and that a looser connection between the dispute and the agreement is irrelevant where, as with Chevron, the parties to the dispute are not the same as the parties to the relevant investment agreement.192 In any event, so the Respondent submits, there is no sufficient connection here between the settlement agreements and the original concession agreements so as to constitute the former as part of \"an investment agreement\" under the BIT.\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 163-164\n\n3.168.\n\nSecond, the Respondent disputes the Claimants' argument that the settlement agreements are themselves capable of qualifying as stand-alone \"investment agreements\". In rejecting the Claimants' broad conception of an investment agreement, the Respondent submits that it is appropriate to have regard to the 2004 US Model BIT, given that it was produced shortly after this BIT was signed.193 The Respondent cites Professor Vandevelde's commentary on the 2004 US Model BIT: \"The new language specifies that an investment agreement is one on the basis of which an investment is made or the renewal of such an agreement.\"194 The Respondent submits that the 2004 US Model BIT does not represent a \"sea-change\" in the definition of investment agreement from that previously adopted in the 1994 US Model BIT;195 but, rather, that both US Model BITs expressly limit the definition to agreements concerning the establishment and renewal of an investment.196\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 169\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 170\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 173\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 74\n\n3.169.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimants' reference, as aids to treaty interpretation, to the different term employed in Article X(2)(c) and to the object and purpose of the BIT and its umbrella clause.197 The Respondent similarly rejects the Claimants' reliance on *Occidental v Ecuador,* the *Commercial Cases Dispute* and *Noble Ventures v Romania*. The Respondent submits that none of these legal materials support a broad interpretation of the phrase \"investment agreement\". On the contrary, so the Respondent suggests, the tribunal in *Burlington v Ecuador* emphasised that \"investment agreement\" is more restrictive than \"investment\" and that it represents a legal rather than an economic threshold.198\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 175-178\n\n*Ibid*., at paras.179-183\n\n3.170.\n\nThird, in response to the Claimants' argument that an investment agreement between a claimant and a respondent is established when an agreement signed by the respondent confers a legally enforceable right on the claimant, the Respondent submits that Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT clearly requires that a claimant is a party to the investment agreement.199\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 186\n\n3.171.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent contends that the \"general principles of arbitration law\" invoked by the Claimants merely support the uncontroversial proposition that third party beneficiaries to a contract may invoke an arbitration agreement contained in that contract. However, it does not necessarily follow that the third party's dispute will fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Similarly in this case, so the Respondent contends, Chevron's alleged dispute with the Respondent falls outside the scope of the relevant arbitration agreement contained in Article VI of the BIT.200\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 188\n\n3.172.\n\nLastly, the Respondent again reiterates that TexPet cannot establish under Article VI(1)(a) that it has any dispute with the Respondent arising out of or relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement because TexPet is not a party to the *Lago Agrio* litigation.201\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 191\n\n3.173.\n\n*(iv) Res Judicata/Issue Preclusion:* The Respondent submits that the decision in the *Commercial Cases Disput* e is irrelevant to the jurisdictional issues before this Tribunal and is not res judicata.\n\n3.174.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that the doctrine of res judicata requires a common identity of parties and of the issues in dispute.202 The Respondent submits that the relevant issues here are: \"(i) whether the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release constituted investment agreements or investments; and (ii) whether the *Lago Agrio* litigation prolonged the life of the original investment in the Ecuadorian hydrocarbons sector.\"203*.* The Respondent asserts that the tribunal in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* did not decide either of these issues; but, rather, that tribunal founded its jurisdiction on the basis of the original concession agreements and litigation arising directly out of those agreements.204 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the assumption of jurisdiction by the tribunal in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* does not render the relevant jurisdictional issues in the present case res judicata.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 193\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 194\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 195-196\n\n3.175.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that this Tribunal should not treat the *Commercial* *Cases Dispute* as \"persuasive authority\", as argued by the Claimants. The Respondent contends that, even if the questions decided there had been similar to those arising in this dispute, the Tribunal would still be free to adopt a different solution and should do so.205\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 199\n\n3.176.\n\n*(v) Estoppel/Preclusion:* The Respondent notes that the Claimants cite no examples of any tribunal invoking the doctrines of estoppel or preclusion to supplant the jurisdictional requirements of a BIT.206 In any event, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot establish the requisite elements of estoppel: in particular, there has been no representation by the Respondent; and, in the absence of any representation, there can be no detrimental reliance by the Claimants.207\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 200\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 205-209\n\n3.177.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot rely on the doctrine of preclusion to circumvent the BIT's jurisdictional requirements, because this doctrine would at the least require the Claimants to establish a representation by the Respondent; and, again, there is none. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the legal materials cited by the Claimants fail to establish that detrimental reliance is not a necessary requirement of the doctrine of preclusion; and there is here no detrimental reliance by the Claimants.208\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 210\n\n3.178.\n\n*(vi) Third Party Rights:* The Respondent maintains that the principle in *Monetary Gold* is applicable to this case. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants' argument that this arbitration concerns only disputes between the Claimants and the Respondent.\n\n3.179.\n\nThe Respondent points to the formal relief claimed by the Claimants in this case. It refers to the declaration that Chevron has no liability or responsibility for environmental impact arising out of the former Consortium that was jointly owned by TexPet and the Respondent; the declaration that \"any judgment rendered against Chevron in the *Lago Agrio* litigation is not final, conclusive or enforceable\"; the declaration that the Respondent or PetroEcuador would be \"exclusively liable\" for any judgment rendered in the *Lago Agrio* litigation; and an order that the Respondent \"use all measures necessary to prevent any judgment against Chevron in the *Lago Agrio* litigation from becoming final, conclusive and enforceable.\"209\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 213\n\n3.180.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, if this relief were granted by this Tribunal, the Claimants would have no *Lago Agrio* litigation to defend; and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs would have no opportunity to obtain or enforce a favourable judgment. On this basis, it is asserted, the Claimants cannot contend that this arbitration will not affect the rights of third parties.210\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 214\n\n3.181.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimants' suggestion that the rights of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs would be adequately protected by the Respondent in this arbitration, noting that the Claimants cite no case where a State respondent has represented the interests of third parties in an investment arbitration.211 The Respondent also rejects the Claimant's suggestion that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs do not have any separate rights from the Respondent on the basis (as alleged by the Claimants) that the Respondent intends to take 90% of any judgment proceeds in that case for public purposes. The Respondent contends that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' intention is for 90% of any judgment proceeds to be administered by an NGO as trustee for the affected communities in the Amazon region.212\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 217\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 219\n\n3.182.\n\n*(vii) Fork in the Road:* The Respondent submits that Claimants' fork in the road response lacks any legal merit, elevates form over substance and indicates an utter disregard for the legal institutions before which the Claimants appear.\n\n3.183.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates its position that the issues before this Tribunal are identical to the issues raised by the Claimants in other proceedings, and that, in particular, the issue central to Chevron's current claim in contract (i.e. the scope of the release in the 1995 Settlement Agreement) is exactly the same issue which Chevron has been asserting in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.213 The Respondent contends that the Lago Agrio court and this Tribunal are required to perform the same legal analysis, that is, to determine whether the 1995 Settlement Agreement operates to bar non-signatory third parties from asserting environmental claims against the Claimants and, if so, whether that agreement would be legal and binding, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, on the Lago Agrio plaintiffs.214\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 222\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 222\n\n3.184.\n\nThe Respondent rejects as \"factually incorrect\" the Claimants' argument that they have not triggered the BIT's fork in the road provision because they have not submitted this dispute to another forum, but are merely asserting defensive measures in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.215 The Respondent repeats that, in securing the dismissal of the *Aguinda* litigation in New York, the Claimants deliberately opted for a trial in Ecuador. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the invocation of the \"contract\" issue in the *Lago Agrio* litigation is not a defensive measure by Chevron, but operates offensively to \"foist all responsibility upon the Republic for the damage alleged by the Lago Agrio plaintiffs.\"216\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 225\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 227\n\n3.185.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent submits that it is irrelevant that the Claimants did not join the Respondent as a party to the *Lago Agrio* litigation. In any event, the Respondent highlights that the Claimants have asserted the same claims against the Respondent in both the 2004 AAA Arbitration and the 2005 legal proceedings in the New York District Court.217 The Respondent rejects the contention that the *Lago Agrio* litigation is a \"fundamentally different dispute \u2026involv[ing] fundamentally different claims\".218\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 227\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 233\n\n3.186.\n\nThe Respondent, in support of its submission that Chevron promised to submit due process claims to another forum, emphasises that, although the commitment was made by Texaco, Chevron has nonetheless specifically invoked and adopted such promise.219 The Respondent further rejects the Claimants' suggestion, based on *Lanco v Argentina*, that an investor's agreement to a forum selection clause without the actual filing of a claim is insufficient to trigger a fork in the road provision. The Respondent submits that, in *Lanco*, the parties could not legally have chosen to submit their dispute to the relevant domestic court; but that, in the present case, it was lawful for Texaco (and Chevron) to make this promise to the US Courts.220 In any event, so the Respondent contends, even if the fork in the road provision were not triggered by this promise, Chevron is nonetheless estopped from maintaining these arbitration proceedings because that would be fundamentally inconsistent with its promise.221\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 239\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 241\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 242\n\n3.187.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion that the BIT's fork in the road provision could not apply here on the ground that contract claims and treaty claims can never be identical. The Respondent submits that this approach would deprive the provision of any effet utile, since it would always prevent its operation in the context of rights which are the principal subject of investment treaties.222 In any event, the Respondent notes that the Claimants do not attempt to deny that the contract claims in the *Lago Agrio* litigation are the same as the contract claims in this arbitration.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 247\n\n***(F) The Claimants' Rejoinder***\n----------------------------------\n\n3.188.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on November 6, 2010.\n\n3.189.\n\n*Preliminary Statement:* In their introductory remarks, the Claimants identify a number of points which are said to be common ground between the Parties: the Respondent concedes that TexPet did have an investment in the hydrocarbons sector in Ecuador, only questioning the relationship between this original investment and the current dispute between the Parties;223 and the Respondent agrees that the only jurisdictional requirements which have to be fulfilled by the Claimants are those contained within the BIT.224\n\nThe Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, at para. 2\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 4\n\n3.190.\n\n*Rejoinder to the Respondent's Reply:* In general terms, the Claimants criticise the Respondent for failing to address the principal jurisdictional issues and \"straining credibility\" on other matters.225 The Claimants then address first the applicable standard of review, with the Claimants contending that the Respondent has mischaracterised the factual basis of the Parties' dispute, and then respond to each of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, including the standing of TexPet and Chevron, third party rights (with the *Monetary Gold* principle) and the application of the BIT's fork in the road provision.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 5\n\n3.191.\n\n*(i) The Standard of Review:* In the Claimants' submission, the Tribunal, in deciding its jurisdiction, may make legal and factual determinations on jurisdictional issues but should not determine any merits issues.226 The Claimants agree with the Respondent that, if a jurisdictional issue \"hinges on a factual determination that may also relate to the merits of the claims\", the Tribunal may determine the facts to the extent necessary for jurisdictional purposes.227 In the Claimants' submission, it is therefore necessary to identify which issues are jurisdictional in nature.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 17\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 18\n\n3.192.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants assert that \"the Government's collusion in the Lago Agrio litigation and the scope of the diffuse rights claims released by the Settlement and Release Agreements are not [jurisdictional issues] and their resolution must await the merits stage\".228 The Claimants submit that, to determine these particular issues, the Tribunal would be required to address the merits in order to decide whether the parties intended contractually to release the diffuse rights claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.229\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 18\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 20\n\n3.193.\n\nThe Claimants further emphasise that all their claims satisfy the applicable \"prima facie\" standard of review, asserting that the Respondent has been unable to rebut the weight of the legal materials supporting the \"prima facie\" test. The Claimants dispute the Respondent's reliance on the *Joy Mining* jurisdictional award, noting that that approach has been discredited in subsequent cases.230\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 22\n\n3.194.\n\n*(iii) Mischaracterised Facts:* The Claimants contend that the Respondent has mischaracterised the material facts of the Parties' dispute, in two particular ways.\n\n3.195.\n\nFirst, the Claimants criticise the Respondent's response to the evidence of fraud and improper collusion in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.231 The Claimants highlight evidence which (according to the Claimants) demonstrates the Respondent's substantial involvement in the *Lago Agrio* litigation dating back to 2003;232 and the Claimants submit that, in the light of this evidence, the Respondent cannot dismiss the facts of this case as \"merely a matter of \u2018Government representatives mak[ing] themselves accessible to parties in a dispute'..\".233 The Claimants contend that the Respondent either simply ignores this evidence or makes \"feeble excuses\" for the high-level contacts revealed by such evidence.234\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 25\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 25\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 26\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 27\n\n3.196.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's factual chronology of TexPet's investment is incorrect. The Claimants contend that the environmental remediation agreements reached between TexPet and the Respondent, together with the work carried out under those agreements, formed part of the underlying investment.235 In this regard, the Claimants highlight (inter alia) the facts that the Respondent's Minister of Energy and Mines first indicated that an environmental audit would be essential in May 1990 and that PetroEcuador and TexPet entered into the contract of environmental investigation services in April 1992 (before the 1973 Concession Agreement expired).236 The Claimants submit that, after receiving the results of the environmental audits, TexPet, PetroEcuador and the Respondent negotiated the allocation of environmental liabilities between themselves, \"as a continued part of the process that had begun at least as early as 1990.\"237 The Claimants assert that it was clear that the parties were actively negotiating their responsibilities for remediation well before the end of the 1973 Concession Agreement.238\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 28\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 29-30\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 31\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 32\n\n3.197.\n\n*(iv) Res Judicata/Issue Preclusion:* The Claimants reject the Respondent's contention that the tribunal's decision in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* is not preclusive in this arbitration on the basis that it is not dispositive of the existence of an \"investment\" or an \"investment agreement\" under the BIT. The Claimants assert that the relevant question is whether the previous tribunal's decision was \"essential or fundamental\" to its award, and that there is no requirement that the determination be \"dispositive\" in the subsequent arbitration.239 The Claimants further contend that the premise of the earlier tribunal's determination is also irrelevant for the purposes of establishing its res judicata effect before the later tribunal.240\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 34\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 35\n\n3.198.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the *Commercial Cases Dispute* tribunal did not expressly determine whether the activities, claims and rights under the settlement agreements constituted part of the Claimants' overall \"investment\" in Ecuador. However, the Claimants submit that there is a \"close similarity\" between these issues and the tribunal's decision that \"lawsuits concern[ing] the liquidation and settlement of claims relating to [an] investment... form part of that investment\". On this basis, the Claimants assert that the tribunal's decision is, at the very least, of highly persuasive effect before this Tribunal.241\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 38\n\n3.199.\n\nFurther, the Claimants reject again the Respondent's contention that the tribunal's decision in the *Commercial Cases Dispute* cannot be considered res judicata since it was made in an interim award and therefore cannot have such effect under Dutch law. The Claimants note that the Respondent do not put forward any example in which an international tribunal has applied domestic law to determine the res judicata effect of a decision made by another international tribunal.242\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 39\n\n3.200.\n\n*(v) Article VI(1)(c):* The Claimants maintain that this Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the Claimants' claims pursuant to Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.\n\n3.201.\n\nThe Claimants contend again, at some length, that their investment in Ecuador must be viewed holistically and, consequently, incorporates the settlement agreements. In the Claimants' submission, the sole question for this Tribunal in relation to jurisdiction ratione materiae under Article VI(1)(c) is whether a sufficient nexus exists between TexPet's underlying oil activities and the activities, rights and claims arising under the settlement agreements.243 The Claimants highlight several factors which, so they submit, entirely dispose of the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction.244\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 41\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 45\n\n3.202.\n\nFirst, the legal framework governing the Claimants' investment confirms the nexus *.* The Claimants reiterate that the BIT expressly protects the investment throughout its lifespan, in particular citing Articles I(3), II(3)(b) and II(7) of the BIT. The Claimants dispute the Respondent's argument that the BIT was not aimed at protecting rights associated with remediation and wind-up activities, but only at stimulating future foreign investment. The Claimants highlight (inter alia) Article XII(1) of the BIT, which expressly protects past investments existing at the time of the BIT's entry into force.245\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 52\n\n3.203.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the Ecuadorian legal framework confirms the nexus between TexPet's underlying operations and the settlement agreements. The Claimants submit that, by investing in Ecuador, TexPet became subject to Ecuadorian law and that, consequently, TexPet's operations were governed by environmental obligations contained both in the 1973 Concession Agreement and under Ecuadorian law.246 The Claimants contend that section 46 of the 1973 Concession Agreement and Ecuadorian law indicate that the parties contemplated that some environmental remediation would be a part of the original investment operation.247 The Claimants accordingly reject the Respondent's suggestion that the remediation issues are not part of the \"natural winding up\" of TexPet's original investment.248\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 54\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 55\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 56\n\n3.204.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the nexus is confirmed by the parties' agreements. The Claimants submit that the Respondent attempts both to limit the scope of the 1973 Concession Agreement and to minimise the relationship between the settlement agreements and TexPet's original investment. In the Claimants' submission, both of these contentions are wrong.249\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 58\n\n3.205.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants reiterate a number of examples in the language in the settlement agreements, which (it is said) indicate that the remediation activities were part of the original investment, including several express references to the 1973 Concession Agreement.250 The Claimants submit that the Respondent ignores almost all of these examples and focuses instead on peripheral issues.251\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 60\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 62\n\n3.206.\n\nFurther, the Claimants reject the Respondent's submission that because the settlement agreements were entered into voluntarily, these agreements must be divorced from the original concession agreements. In the Claimants' submission, the mechanism by which TexPet chose to comply with its obligations does not establish that those obligations did not arise from the 1973 Concession Agreement.252\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 64\n\n3.207.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent argues that, at best, the only link which could be established between the original investment and the settlement agreements is a \"but for\" link; and that the Respondent argues that such a link is legally insufficient because a \"material legal connection\" is required. In response to these arguments, the Claimants submit that the Respondent does not cite any legal materials establishing that a \"but for\" link is insufficient, or that supports the Respondent's alleged threshold of a \"material legal connection\".253 Further, the Claimants dismiss the Respondent's attempt to distinguish the arbitral jurisprudence on the lifespan of the investment doctrine and the holistic approach, as \"wholly unconvincing\".254 The Claimants highlight the *Inmaris* decision in particular, noting that the tribunal there indicated that the \"contractual cross references\" supported the integrated nature of the operations.255\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 65\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 65\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 74\n\n3.208.\n\nSecond, the Claimants maintain that the settlement agreements also qualify as \u2018freestanding investments' under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n3.209.\n\nIn asserting that these settlement agreements can independently qualify as investments, the Claimants emphasise that they fall squarely within the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT. The Claimants contend that, although the Respondent \" pays lip service\" to the BIT's language, it fails to address the Claimants' submissions that: (i) the text and structure of Article I(1)(a) is \"broad and all-encompassing\" and that other provisions of the BIT similarly indicate that the parties intended the definition of \"investment\" to be as broad as possible; (ii) arbitral jurisprudence supports an expansive interpretation of the BIT's definition; and (iii) the investment falls squarely within at least three separate categories of \"investment\" listed in Article I(1)(a).256\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 84\n\n3.210.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the language and structure of the BIT is crucial, because \"the categories of investments were carefully crafted by the BIT's drafters and embody the parties' consent\". If the parties had intended to include economic characteristics, they could have done so \u2013 but, significantly, did not do so.257\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 85\n\n3.211.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute the Respondent's arguments regarding \"intrinsic economic traits\". The Claimants contend that the Respondent's position has changed with its Reply Memorial because it now argues that the settlement agreements do not bear any \"intrinsic economic traits\".258 The Claimants emphasise that the Respondent's \"pragmatic approach\" acknowledges that economic characteristics are merely \"benchmarks\" and are not jurisdictional criteria.259 Indeed, the Claimants assert that this position has considerable support in arbitral jurisprudence.260\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 86\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 87\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 87\n\n3.212.\n\nThe Claimants reject the policy reasons by reference to which the Respondent encourages this Tribunal to apply an \"economic characteristics\" threshold. In particular, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's suggestion that these characteristics need to be universally applied to ensure a consistent application of investor protection is misplaced. The Claimants note that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define an \"investment\".261 Further, the Claimants submit, even if an ICSID and UNCITRAL tribunal were to adopt different approaches, that should not be disparaged since the BIT expressly allows for a claimant's choosing between ICSID and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.262\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 90\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 91\n\n3.213.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants reiterate that the settlement agreements do satisfy the inherent economic traits of an \"investment\" under this BIT. The Claimants submit that the Respondent wrongly seeks to parse the settlement agreements into separate parts, whereas the tribunal in *Inmaris v Ukraine* made clear that \"... it is sufficient that the transaction as whole meets those requirements.\"263\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 94\n\n3.214.\n\nThird, the Claimants maintain that the Municipal and Provincial Releases also qualify as investments under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n3.215.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that these Municipal and Provincial Releases are irrelevant. The Claimants submit that: \"The overlapping, independently sufficient and comprehensive corpus of release agreements executed by every governmental entity with even arguable standing to assert such claims reinforces Claimants' legitimate expectations to be free from any further diffuse environmental claims...\"264 The Claimants contend that the 1995 Settlement Agreement on the one hand and the Municipal and Provincial Releases on the other are each sufficient to bar all \"diffuse\" environmental liability claims alleged against the Claimants.265\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 102\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 103\n\n3.216.\n\n*(vi) Article VI(1)(a) - TexPet's Claims:* The Claimants contend that the Respondent's only response to the Claimants' submissions on this point in their Counter-Memorial is to reiterate its previous arguments that the Claimants cannot establish, even on a prima facie basis, that the Claimants have an investment dispute relating to an investment agreement with the Respondent.266 The Claimants note that the Respondent's arguments that: (i) the dispute does not relate to the original concession agreements, and (ii) that the settlement agreements do not constitute \"investment agreements\" under the BIT, are in fact raised only in the context of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections concerning Chevron. The Claimants nonetheless maintain that the Respondent's submissions are equally misplaced with regard to TexPet.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 106\n\n3.217.\n\nFirst, as regards the original Concession Agreements, the Claimants stress first the broad meaning of the phrase \"relating to\" in Article VI(1) of the BIT. The Claimants contend that the Respondent appears to embrace the Claimants' interpretation of this phrase, merely arguing that there is no \"legally significant connection\" between the dispute and the original concession agreements.267 In rejecting the Respondent's argument, the Claimants highlight, in particular, the following factors.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 108\n\n3.218.\n\nIt will not be possible for the Tribunal to decide whether there is a breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement without referring to the original concession agreements because the releases specifically applies to claims \"\u2026arising from the Operations of the Consortium\", which is defined in the 1995 Settlement Agreement as covering activities carried out under the \"Consortium Agreements\", which in turn is defined as including the 1973 concession agreement.268 This is not simply a \"but for\" connection, but rather that the concession agreements constitute a \"key element of the circumstances giving rise to TexPet's claims\".269 The Respondent also fails to address the Claimants' submission that the plaintiffs in the *Lago Agrio* litigation specifically allege that TexPet violated its obligations under section 46 of the 1973 Concession Agreement.270 The 1995 Settlement Agreement contains numerous provisions which link the parties' rights and obligations under that 1995 agreement to the \"Consortium Agreements\" and the \"operations of the Consortium\".271 Lastly, in the context of the question whether an arbitration agreement contained in an original contract is applicable to disputes regarding a later agreement which settles disputes arising under the original contract, the Claimants reiterate that courts and tribunals have consistently held that a claim for breach of such a settlement agreement \"relates to\" the original contract,272 and that this approach applies equally to non-contractual disputes provided that they relate to the original contract.273\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 109\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 110\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 111\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 112\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 113.\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 114\n\n3.219.\n\nGiven these several factors, the Claimants contend that both the contractual and noncontractual claims which TexPet and the Respondent settled under the 1995 Settlement Agreement \"related to\" the original concession agreements; and the Parties' dispute in this arbitration relates to both as an investment.274\n\n*Ibid*,. at para. 115\n\n3.220.\n\nSecond, as regards the settlement agreements qualifying as \"investment agreements\", the Claimants contend that the Respondent's approach conflicts with the rules of treaty interpretation contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In particular, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's reliance on extrinsic materials is both unnecessary and inappropriate, given that the meaning of this phrase can be clearly established by applying the \"ordinary\" rules of interpretation in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.275\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 118\n\n3.221.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the USA-Russia BIT (invoked by the Respondent) actually supports the Claimants' broad interpretation of \"investment agreement\".276 The Claimants dispute the relevance of the 1994 and 2004 US Model BITs and warn that Professor Vandevelde's assertion about the \"underlying intent in prior models\" is contradicted elsewhere in his writings.277 Moreover, the Claimants reiterate that the broad meaning of \"investment agreement\" is supported by the internal structure of the BIT, in particular the use of the phrase in Article X(2)(c), the reference back to Article VI(1)(a) and the context provided by the Preamble and the Umbrella Clause.278\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 119\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 121\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 123-125\n\n3.222.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimants assert, the \"costly and extensive\" remediation works undertaken by TexPet under the settlement agreements constitute \"investments\"; and that, since those obligations were undertaken under the settlement agreements, those agreements must therefore be \"investment agreements\" for the purposes of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.279\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 128\n\n3.223.\n\n*(vii) Article VI(1)(a) - Chevron's Claims:* The Claimants maintain that the important difference between the Parties as regards Chevron is the interpretation and application of the requirement, in Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, that the investment agreement be \"between\" the claimant and the respondent host State.280\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 132\n\n3.224.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT does not require that the claimant be a signatory or even a party to the investment agreement: the word \"between\" bears a wider meaning. The Claimants refer to the English dictionary definition of \"serving to connect or unite in a relationship\".281 On this basis, the Claimants submit that an investment agreement conferring legal rights on a third party which are enforceable against a State qualifies as an \"investment agreement between\" that third party and the host State.282\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 133\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 133\n\n3.225.\n\nIn further support of this submission, the Claimants emphasise that in circumstances where an arbitration agreement requires that parties to the arbitration be \"parties\" to the contract containing the arbitration agreement, the courts have consistently held that a third party beneficiary should be treated as a party to the contract for the purposes of determining whether a tribunal has jurisdiction under the arbitration agreement.283\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 134\n\n3.226.\n\nFurther, the Claimants reiterate that the Respondent is estopped from objecting to this Tribunal's jurisdiction over Chevron's claims on the basis that Chevron did not sign the settlement agreements, because: (i) the Lago Agrio Court's assertion of de facto jurisdiction over Chevron is clearly intended to circumvent the application of these settlement agreements; (ii) the issues that Chevron seeks to have decided in this arbitration are \"intricately intertwined\" with the settlement agreements; and (iii) the Respondent (and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs) cannot assert that Chevron is responsible for TexPet's alleged conduct in domestic litigation, whilst at the same time asserting that Chevron is separate from TexPet in regard to the enforcement of the settlement agreements.284\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 139\n\n3.227.\n\nThe Claimants also maintain that Chevron has standing to enforce the settlement agreements against the Respondent. The Claimants highlight five factors in support of this submission.\n\n3.228.\n\nFirst, Chevron is a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement made with the Respondent. The Claimants emphasise that this question should be approached on the basis of the rules of contractual interpretation contained in the Ecuadorian Civil Code; and that, applying these rules, the Spanish word *\"principales\"* clearly means \"parent corporation\", i.e. covering Chevron as TexPet's parent.285 The analysis of the Respondent's expert, Dr Salgado, is criticised as \"flawed\" by the Claimants because it flies in the face of the parties' objective intentions, which (as Dr Salgado himself acknowledges) is the \"ultimate interpretive inquiry\" under Ecuadorian law.286\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 140\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 140-144\n\n3.229.\n\nThe Claimants further emphasise that it would make no sense to interpret \"principales\" as being confined to the relationship of principal and agent because an agent, acting within the scope of its agency, does not bind itself contractually. Thus, there would be no point in a settlement agreement providing for the release of liability of such agents. Moreover, in the 1995 Settlement Agreement, TexPet was not acting in an agency capacity for a separate principal; but, rather, it was acting in its own capacity to negotiate a release of liability in respect of its own alleged conduct. On this basis, it is submitted by the Claimants that the Respondent's interpretation of \"principales\" would mean that the Respondent's release applied to no party at all.287\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 145\n\n3.230.\n\nThe Claimants also emphasise that the Respondent concedes that the Municipal and Provincial Releases do cover Chevron in their releases. In the Claimants' submission, the parties cannot have intended Chevron (as a future parent) to be released under some settlement agreements but not under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.288 The Claimants note that the Municipal and Provincial Releases also expressly name Texaco as a releasee; and consequently the Respondent cannot consistently argue that the express reference to Texaco in the 1995 Settlement Agreement indicates that the parties did not intend there to include Chevron as a Releasee.289\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 149\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 150\n\n3.231.\n\nSecond, the settlement agreements cover future parent corporations as owners. The Claimants note that, in arguing that the 1995 Settlement Agreement cannot be taken to release future parent corporations, the Respondent must necessarily be acknowledging the corporate distinction between Texaco and Chevron; and that the Respondent then relies on that legal distinction to assert that Chevron cannot take any benefit under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. However, as the Claimants emphasise again, the Respondent here tries to have it both ways, because the Respondent also holds Chevron legally accountable for the separate conduct of Texaco.290\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 152\n\n3.232.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the Respondent's reliance on US case law in support of its contention that future parent corporations should not be regarded as covered releasees, emphasising that the 1995 Settlement Agreement must be construed according to Ecuadorian law.291 Additionally, the Claimants note that the Respondent's reliance on *Nagel v Czech Republic* is misplaced because that arbitration concerned a materially different factual dispute.292 Again, the Claimants emphasise that, in determining the scope of the release, the principal inquiry is directed at the parties' objective intentions. In this regard, the Claimants submit that it would have made no sense for the parties to enter into an agreement which did not release future parent corporations from liability, such as Chevron.293\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 153\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 154\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 155\n\n3.233.\n\nThird, the Claimants have maintained a consistent position as to Chevron's standing; and that the Respondent wrongly argues that the Claimants' interpretation of \"principales\" contradicts earlier positions taken by the Claimants. Moreover, the Claimants contend that the materials cited by the Respondent in fact demonstrate that the Claimants have consistently taken the view that the release extends to parent corporations, i.e. Chevron.294\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 156\n\n3.234.\n\nFourth, the Respondent concedes that Releasees may enforce their rights. The Claimants notes that the Respondent agrees that \"Article 9.4 cannot be interpreted to mean the releasees may not invoke and enforce the releases that the Agreement expressly provides to them.\" However, the Claimants do not agree with the Respondent's argument that persons who are not covered releasees may not invoke the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Rather, the Claimants contend that, if the Respondent seeks to assert liability against Chevron as if it were TexPet, then Chevron may invoke TexPet's defences against the Respondent's claim.295\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 157\n\n3.235.\n\nFifth, Chevron has standing to assert BIT claims against the Respondent as a result of its status as TexPet's indirect shareholder. The Claimants reject the Respondent's analysis of the cited legal materials to the effect that indirect shareholders may only bring a claim in respect of the diminution in the value of their shares in the investor-company. The Claimants consider in detail the treatise by Messrs Ripinsky and Williams, submitting that their analysis does not support the Respondent's position, but rather indicates that it is legally possible for an indirect shareholder's investment to be characterised as the \"underlying business unit\", in particular where a BIT contains a broad definition of \"investment\". In the present case, the Claimants submit that the BIT definition extends broadly to \"every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by national or companies of the other Party\"; and Chevron's investment should therefore be understood as the \"assets and legal rights of the underlying business unit.\"296\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 160-161 and 167\n\n3.236.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants contend that the decision of the ICSID annulment committee in *Azurix v Argentina* supports their contentions: the committee there decided, as a result of Azurix's shareholding in ABA, that Azurix had \"interests in the assets\" of ABA, and that these interests included ABA's legal and contractual rights.297 In the light of this analysis of academic and arbitral materials, the Claimants contend that Chevron's investment can include both its shares in TexPet and also its interests in TexPet's assets, contractual rights and claims to performance.298\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 165\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 170\n\n3.237.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the suggestion that TexPet cannot constitute Chevron's \"investment\" because TexPet is not incorporated in Ecuador. The Claimants submit that the BIT defines a \"company\" of a party as a company that is \"legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party\"; and that, moreover, the definition of \"investment\" is not so limited. Thus, the Claimants submit that TexPet can be an Chevron's \"investment\" in Ecuador.299\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 171\n\n3.238.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants reiterate that, even if Chevron can only assert a claim based on the diminution in the value of its shares in TexPet, it clearly has standing to do so since TexPet's shares are worth more with the release than without the release, and therefore the Respondent's conduct in undermining the release inevitably undermines the value of TexPet's shares.300\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 174\n\n3.239.\n\n*(viii) TexPet's Standing:* The Claimants also maintain that TexPet has standing to enforce the settlement agreements against the Respondent in this arbitration for itself and for Chevron's benefit. The Claimants make three particular points in support of this submission.\n\n3.240.\n\nFirst, under Ecuadorian law, a party may seek specific performance of a contract, even if has suffered no damage from the other party's breach. The Claimants contend that the Respondent' own legal expert on Ecuadorian law supports this proposition.301 Second, the TexPet has shown that it has suffered damage. The Claimants rely on the submission that the Respondent's conduct violates international law and that consequently TexPet has suffered moral damage for which international law allows compensation (as claimed by TexPet); and further, that moral damages may be claimed under the Ecuadorian Civil Code.302 Third, the Claimants submit that TexPet has standing to seek a declaratory interpretation of the settlement agreements in circumstances where the parties dispute the content of those rights and obligations.303\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 176\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 178\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 179\n\n3.241.\n\n*(ix) Estoppel/Preclusion:* The Claimants acknowledge that they do not rely on these doctrines as providing an independent basis for this Tribunal's jurisdiction, but rather contend that the Respondent is thereby precluded from making jurisdictional objections based on its own inconsistent positions.304 The Claimants reiterate that the Respondent has \"blown hot and cold\" with regard to the corporate separateness of Chevron, TexPet and Texaco in various legal proceedings; and the Claimants contend that these inconsistent positions indicate a lack of good faith by the Respondent.305\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 182\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 184\n\n3.242.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's arguments on estoppel, the Claimants contend that a representation may be founded on inaction or silence.306 In any event, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has communicated its position clearly on numerous occasions, for example by instigating criminal proceedings against Chevron's lawyers.307 Moreover, the Claimants contend that it is not necessary for the representation to relate specifically to international law and the jurisdictional requirements of the BIT: it is enough that the Respondent has represented that it has jurisdiction over Chevron.308\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 185\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 185\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 187\n\n3.243.\n\n*(x) Third Party Rights:* The Claimants maintain that there are no legitimate third party rights at issue in these arbitration proceedings. The Claimants reiterate that the *Monetary Gold* principle is inapplicable here because the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not asserting separate legal rights, but are asserting the same rights which the Respondent released in the settlement agreements.309 The Claimants acknowledge that their position on third party rights is not solely based on the Attorney General's statement regarding the administration of the Lago Agrio judgment.310 The Claimants contend that the Respondent represented and released the same rights that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs now assert; and, since the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are asserting the interests of the Ecuadorian community to live in a clean environment, the Ecuadorian Constitution expressly obliges the Ecuadorian State to represent those interests. In the Claimants' submission, the Respondent did represent those interests in entering into the settlement agreements. Moreover, in the light of this constitutional provision, the Respondent is obliged and not merely entitled to represent any interest which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs may have in these arbitration proceedings.311\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 191\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 192\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 194\n\n3.244.\n\nMore generally, the Claimants repeat that the *Monetary Gold* principle should not be extended to investor-state arbitration, based on the contention that whilst the Tribunal in this arbitration may determine the Respondent's international obligations under the BIT, the domestic *Lago Agrio* litigation operates on a different legal plane.312 The Claimants therefore contend that if the Tribunal's determination of the Respondent's obligations under the BIT were to jeopardise the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' rights under Ecuadorian law, that may create an issue between those plaintiffs and the Respondent; but the Respondent is not thereby permitted to rely upon its domestic obligations to evade its international law obligations to the Claimants.313\n\n*Ibid*., at para 199\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 200\n\n3.245.\n\n*(xi) Fork in the Road:* The Claimants maintain that the Respondent's Reply ignores the plain meaning of the fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT. The Claimants make four specific points.\n\n3.246.\n\nFirst, Chevron did not submit the investment dispute in this case to the Lago Agrio Court. The Claimants stress that the BIT's fork in the road provision is predicated on an \"investment dispute\" that cannot be settled amicably; and, consequently, the Respondent must show that the same \"investment dispute\" has been submitted to domestic legal proceedings. The Claimants reiterate that the issues and relief sought in the *Lago Agrio* litigation are materially different from those at issue in this arbitration. In particular, in this arbitration the Claimants assert positive claims against the Respondent (inter alia) for violations of the BIT and breaches of the settlement agreements. However, in the *Lago Agrio* litigation, the Claimants have brought no positive claims against the Respondent and have merely relied on the settlement agreements for the dismissal of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' claims.314\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 207\n\n3.247.\n\nSecond, the Claimants did not submit this investment dispute to the New York Courts. The Claimants contend that, even if the Claimants had submitted the same investment dispute to the New York Courts, this could not trigger the BIT's fork in the road provision given that these were legal proceedings in the USA and not Ecuador.315 In any event, the Claimants deny that they ever submitted this dispute to the New York Courts. In particular, the Claimants emphasise that the Respondent sought and obtained the dismissal of the Claimants' counterclaims in the New York litigation on the basis of sovereign immunity and forum non conveniens. Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the Respondent cannot now rely on these counterclaims for the purpose of its arguments under the BIT's fork in the road provision.316\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 208\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 210\n\n3.248.\n\nThird, the Claimants maintain that they have never submitted this investment dispute in the *Aguinda* litigation in New York. As regards the Respondent's reliance on the undertaking by Texaco, the Claimants contend that, as a matter of fact, the undertaking was much more narrowly defined than the Respondent now suggests; and in particular that it made clear that Texaco did not waive \"all claims and defences that it may have or be entitled to assert\u2026\"317 Further, the Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that Chevron adopted the \"representation\" made by Texaco. The Claimants note that the documents cited by the Respondent only refer to the forum non conveniens dismissal, which, as the Claimants explain, was not given on the basis of the broad \"promise\" which the Respondent now alleges.318\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 213-216\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 217\n\n3.249.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants maintain that the forum non conveniens dismissal by the New York Courts cannot trigger the BIT's fork in the road provision, since it relates to legal proceedings in the USA, whereas the BIT's fork in the road provision is only triggered by Ecuadorian legal proceedings.319 The Claimants reiterate their submissions that the fork in the road provision also requires a claimant to have made a choice; and it therefore cannot apply to a situation where the claimant in the arbitral proceedings has been forced to defend earlier domestic proceedings.320\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 219\n\n*Ibid*., at paras. 220-222\n\n3.250.\n\n*(xii) Estoppel:* In rejecting the Respondent's argument that the Claimants are estopped from bringing their claims in this arbitration because these arbitration proceedings are \"fundamentally inconsistent\" with their alleged promise given to the US courts, the Claimants again highlight the limited nature of the undertaking given by Texaco to the New York Courts.321 The Claimants reiterate that, even if such a promise had been given as alleged by the Respondent, it was premised on Texaco (with Chevron) receiving fair treatment from the Ecuadorian Courts; and that the deterioration and lack of independence of the Ecuadorian judiciary in this case prevents any estoppel arising in favour of the Respondent.322\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 226\n\n*Ibid*., at para. 227\n\n***(G) The Jurisdiction Hearing***\n----------------------------------\n\n3.251.\n\nThe Parties developed their respective cases orally at the Jurisdiction Hearing, by their legal representatives. No factual or expert witness testified before the Tribunal at this Hearing. It would lengthen unduly this summary of the Parties' jurisdictional cases by describing here the Parties' oral submissions; and the Tribunal have taken these fully into account in its analysis of the Parties' overall submissions below in Part IV of this Award.\n\n3.252.\n\n*The Respondent's Attorney-General:* However, it is appropriate here to set out the opening address made by the Respondent's Attorney-General at the Jurisdiction Hearing, as interpreted and recorded in the English transcript of the Hearing, as follows [D1.8]:\n\n*\"Members of the Tribunal, I participate in this Hearing in my condition of Procurador General of the State of the Republic of Ecuador. With me are some of the members of the team that is in charge of the responsibility of defending the Republic in this international arbitration of investors and state. Before allowing to speak our lawyers of Winston and Matrix I want to talk to you briefly.*\n\n*As a first point, I would like to talk about the present justice system in Ecuador. In the year 2008, the latest Constitutional Assembly in Ecuador as an expression of sovereign expression of the Ecuadorian nation approved the new Constitution that rules our country at the moment. This fundamental law is a product of the most important democratic exercise in Ecuador in the later years, with more than 63 percent of votes in favour of the referendum which approved the Constitution.*\n\n*In terms of the justice administration, the new Constitution consolidated previous efforts of the judicial reform of Nineties. Although still we are not in the position that we would like to be, we are achieving important progress in this ambit. First of all, we have to concentrate the existence of Courts and other Tribunals to marginal places allowing better access to justice. [Secondly,] There is an improvement in justice efficiency in relation to the number of cases that are resolved. Thirdly, we have achieved greater transparency and publicity in terms of the activities of the judiciary; and, fourthly, we have developed norms that rules behaviour of judges and lawyers.*\n\n*In this way, in our system of justice is an improvement. There is advancement. We continuously improve trying to achieve high standards, standards of efficiency for the benefit of the Ecuadorian society.*\n\n*Now we concentrate in the present arbitration. The Ecuadorian Republic is trying to be trapped in a private controversy between two private litigants that are foreign to the State: On the one hand, the transnational companies Chevron and Texaco, and the other part, the indigenous people from Lago Agrio. In this litigation, what is at stake is the improvement of health in a locality of Ecuador that is still pending a resolution vis-\u00e0-vis a court in Amazonia in Ecuador. The Ecuadorian State is not part of this case. The controversy is being known by the presidency of the Provincial Court in Lago Agrio as a result of a litigation of 10 years against the Claimants and the tribunals of the United States. In that moment, the Claimants supported, without any objection, and presented the advantages of a judicial system vis-\u00e0-vis the Courts of the United States.*\n\n*So, our judicial system should be in charge of knowing about this case in Lago Agrio. At the moment, the Claimants have decided that they don't want to litigate against the Claimants of Lago Agrio, but they want to replace these Claimants with the Republic of Ecuador as part of the controversy, and they fabricated a crisis in the justice administration and a problem of Government in Ecuador. They have redirected that offensive against those that once offered an excellent relationship in previous decades.*\n\n*The Claimants pretend to come unto this Arbitration Tribunal claiming for rights that they don't have in violation of the judicial commitments in the United States. So, the Republic of Ecuador, in an unconstitutional manner, should violate independency of the legal system to close a case of Lago Agrio.*\n\n*I accepted my designation, and I have done my job as Procurador of the State of the Republic of Ecuador convinced and respectful of the autonomy of the functions of the State because I am convinced of the independency of the justice system of my country and the process of change. But by the same token I am very conscious of the difficult problems affecting our systems still. We still have delays in processes in front of our courts. We have complaints against dishonest Courts, and we have problems of salaries for judges and Magistrates and lawyers. But I am conscious of our problems.*\n\n*We know our deficiencies, but we are working to correct them. The recent institution by the Council of Judiciary of Juan Nunez, who was in charge of the case of Lago Agrio until September 2009, is the testimony of the efforts to achieve a justice administration more robust and transparent.*\n\n*From the reading of Memorials and other communications from the Claimants in the present arbitration case, it is obvious that we are talking of different illicit case of the Claimants of Lago Agrio. But it is more obvious that the Claimants tried to convert the local litigation in Ecuador in an international litigation against a sovereign State has not been part of the controversy, particularly where one of the parties, transnational companies that have unlimited resources who now have presented this arbitration of investments looking for the protection under the argument that to operate in Ecuador is inconvenient. We have to understand inconvenient to their interests, of course.*\n\n*The position of the Ecuadorian Republic in the case of Lago Agrio as well as the position of Ecuador in any litigation of similar characteristics in Ecuadorian Courts is very clear and firm position. It's a litigation between private parties, the Claimants* *of Lago Agrio and Chevron, and the only role that the Republic of Ecuador in this case has to fulfil is to be the forum through its system of justice administration of a litigation where Chevron previously tried to prove; that is, in Ecuador where the case should be known.*\n\n*The Republic of Ecuador does not deny the support that [Texaco] received of the Government at the time in a note to the State Department of the United States, inviting the American Government to intervene in the case Aguinda with the intention to send the case to Ecuador. The same way we do not deny that the Governments of the time including the present administration made public the declarations in support of the people of Lago Agrio, but I conclude in two things.*\n\n*First of all, there is no indication that in the case of Lago Agrio or its antecessor Lago Inda [Aguinda]; secondly, the Republic of Ecuador never interfered with the judicial process of Lago Agrio. The Republic of Ecuador has become the center of an attack by Chevron against the Ecuadorian State. Ecuador had to confront, to face this with the limited resources it has, different legal cases. The first case is Chevron of AAA and the courts of New York. The second case, Chevron is an arbitration of investment based in The Hague. And this arbitration, that is a third case presented by Chevron, and especially the machine of public relations of the Claimants that every year work in the corridors of the American Congress and also in the offices of the representatives of commerce of the United States looking to cancel the preferences that Ecuador enjoys from the commercial viewpoint, with the intention of pressurizing the Government to intervene in the case of Lago Agrio in favour of Chevron.*\n\n*This offensive without limit started in 2003, when Ecuador informed Chevron and the demandantes of Lago Agrio that it would keep a neutral position in this case, and we refused to interfere with the justice administration to disqualify this claim.*\n\n*In this Hearing of Jurisdiction that starts today, a request from you, members of the Court, that you look at this arbitration as what it is really, the effort by the Claimants to transform artificially a domestic litigation between private parties in the controversy of international characters between a State and investors, eliminating the rights of the Ecuadorian Courts and the people of Lago Agrio denying or claiming elements of a Treaty -- of investment five years after Texaco left our country after collecting enormous profits, thanks to our oil, during 20 years.\"*\n\n3.253.\n\n*Chevron's General Counsel:* In response, Chevron's General Counsel, Mr Pate, made the following statement (in English), which it is similarly appropriate to cite in full, as recorded in the transcript [D1,111], as follows:\n\n*\"It was a privilege to hear directly from Solicitor General Garcia. His decision to address the Tribunal himself shows the importance of this matter to his client. I likewise will make a few preliminary points before turning to Mr. Bishop and Professor Crawford for the substantive presentations.*\n\n*Chevron take no pleasure any in dispute with any sovereign Government. Chevron prides itself on constructive relations with Governments that employ widely varying systems and policies of Government and hold wildly varying attitudes toward the Government policies of the United States.*\n\n*Chevron's subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company, pursued constructive relations with Ecuador from the 1960s to the 1990s when the Government of Ecuador decided at that time that the entire Concession and operation should be awarded to the PetroEcuador company.*\n\n*During Texaco's time, it earned profits described as enormous by Dr. Garcia, of some $500 million. Ecuador's royalties, taxes, and other earnings during that same time period were approximately $23 billion, and approximately $116 billion through 2008. Texaco cleaned up when it left and awaits PetroEcuador's promised cleanup of its share of past impacts, not to mention what PetroEcuador will do about its pollution during the succeeding 18 years.*\n\n*Let me now make some comments that relate to the so-called \"Lago Agrio Plaintiffs\", not to the Government of Ecuador. Chevron believes the dramatic evidence in the Crude video outtakes and recently produced documents has brought this entire situation into a fundamentally new phase. The Tribunal need not take my word for this, for several U.S. federal judges have noted that the evidence has \"sent shock waves through the legal community\", and shows activity that should be recognized as fraud by any Court.*\n\n*Fraudulent filings, threats to judges, procuring sham criminal charges to be bartered for settlement money, and other activities by the American Plaintiffs' lawyers and their allies have been shown on high definition video and in the Plaintiffs' lawyers own documents.*\n\n*Chevron will not give the so-called \u2018Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' lawyers', whomever they really represent, the extorted settlement money they seek. As to them, we hope only that they will be brought to justice by the appropriate authorities.*\n\n*Now, Chevron has previously made detailed arguments about the interference by the Government of Ecuador in the Lago litigation, and it stands by those, but again, my comments on the Crude video evidence this afternoon are about the private Plaintiffs' lawyers and their profit motivated litigation investors.*\n\n*The question for the Government of Ecuador, once it has had a fair opportunity to address the emerging evidence, is how it will respond to the evidence. In the Lago Agrio Court, Chevron's lawyers have lately been fined and threatened with other sanctions simply for presenting the evidence of fraud on the Tribunal. I note I have yet to hear from any speaker before this Tribunal any hint of doubt that the Lago Agrio Court will render a judgment against Chevron, no matter what evidence is shown to that Court. And, of course, the Government of Ecuador stands to get 90 percent of any judgment in the case. The figure now being sought is $113 billion.*\n\n*Dr. Garcia states with sincerity that Ecuador has nothing to do with the Lago Agrio Case, yet Mr. Bloom has submitted in New York just Friday attesting to the existence of a common-interest privilege with the Lago Agrio Plantiffs' lawyers since 2006. The evidence of communication between Winston & Strawn and Steven Donziger is copious.*\n\n*A U.S. Federal Magistrate Judge recently stated that any country that does not recognize what has happened in Lago Agrio as a fraud has bigger problems than an oil spill.*\n\n*Chevron eagerly awaits to what the Republic of Ecuador's reaction to the new evidence may be and whether the Republic believes there is anything that it and Chevron might constructively do together to address that situation.\"*\n\n3.254.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both statements touch generally upon the most important questions raised by the Parties; namely the Respondent's legal responsibilities under the BIT (both by its executive and judicial branches) for events allegedly occurring in the *Lago Agrio* litigation in Ecuador. In the Tribunal's view, these questions impinge more on the merits of the Parties' dispute, rather than the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. It is, however, impossible for the Tribunal to lose sight of both these statements in addressing the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and the Claimants' jurisdictional responses.\n\n***PART IV: THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(A) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nIt is appropriate to address in turn the issues raised by each of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in regard to the Claimants' claims.\n\n4.2.\n\nFor ease of reference below, the Tribunal refers to the 1995 Settlement Agreement as including the 1998 *Acta Final* (also called by the Claimants \"the 1998 Settlement and Release Agreement\") and both, together with the Municipal and Provincial Releases, as included in the generic shorthand term \"settlement agreements\". The 1995 Settlement Agreement made with the Respondent lies, of course, at the heart of the Claimants' claims against the Respondent, as both an alleged \"investment\" and an alleged \"investment agreement\" under the BIT; and the Tribunal has therefore concentrated its analysis on that particular settlement agreement.\n\n***(B) The Prima Facie Standard***\n----------------------------------\n\n4.3.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree in part upon the general prima facie standard of review to be applied by the Tribunal to the Claimants' claims as a matter of jurisdiction; but they dispute its scope and application to this case. Their respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1,115ff and D2,240, 321 & 336.\n\n4.4.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, under the BIT and Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal is required to decide in regard to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections whether or not, if the facts alleged by the Claimants are assumed to be true, the Claimants' claims would be capable of constituting breaches of the BIT as pleaded by the Claimants in their Notice of Arbitration (as later clarified and confirmed by their Memorial on the Merits).\n\n4.5.\n\nAs regards facts alleged by the Claimants but not admitted or denied by the Respondent, the Tribunal is required to test the factual basis of the Claimant's claims by reference to a prima facie standard. That standard was most clearly expressed by Judge Higgins in the well-known passage from her separate opinion in *Oil Platforms;* and it has been applied since by many arbitration tribunals in addressing jurisdictional objections made in investor-state arbitrations.1\n\n*Oil Platforms*, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins at p. 856, para. 32. These other investor-state arbitrations are collected in Schreuer et al, p. 540 (footnote 121)\n\n4.6.\n\nIn short, by that standard, the Tribunal is here required for jurisdictional purposes, at the early stage of this arbitration (i.e. before the Respondent has pleaded any defence on the merits, particularly in response to the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits), to assume that the facts pleaded by the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration are true unless such factual pleading is incredible, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise advanced by the Claimants in bad faith. Without having heard factual evidence from both sides (which it has not), the Tribunal cannot here finally determine any issue of fact disputed by the Parties: the relevant evidence before the Tribunal is materially incomplete; such evidence as has been adduced is made in writing only, without being tested orally by cross-examination or questions from the Tribunal to witnesses; and it has been manifest from the beginning of this arbitration that much of the Claimants' factual case is strongly disputed by the Respondent.\n\n4.7.\n\nThe practical difficulty arises from the use of the Latin term \"prima facie\". In the Tribunal's view, it does not mean, at this early procedural stage, that the Claimants must satisfy the Tribunal that their case, as now pleaded, would necessarily prevail on the merits if this arbitration were to proceed beyond the jurisdictional stage. Nor can it mean, in a heavily adversarial procedure with both sides here making very extensive submissions and submitting numerous exhibits, that the Tribunal should only investigate the apparent surface of the Claimants' case on the merits. In other words, the jurisdictional stage of this arbitration cannot take the form of a preliminary hearing on the merits: but, conversely, the Claimants must establish that their case is sufficiently serious to proceed to a full hearing on the merits.\n\n4.8.\n\nThe Tribunal specifically rejects as imposing too high a prima facie standard the Respondent's submission at the Jurisdiction Hearing that the Claimants must already have established their case with a 51% chance of success, i.e. on a balance of probabilities (D2,242); and the Tribunal prefers, to this extent, the Claimants' submissions that their case should be \"decently arguable\" or that it has \"a reasonable possibility as pleaded\" [D2,321 & 338].\n\n4.9.\n\nThere is another feature of the prima facie standard to which the Respondent's Counsel drew attention [D2,243]: it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal here to found its jurisdiction on any of the Claimants' claims on the basis of an assumed fact (alleged by the Claimants but disputed by the Respondent) if that factual issue was never again to be examined by the Tribunal. In the context of factual issues which are common to both jurisdictional objections and the merits of the Parties' dispute, there is of course no like difficulty; but the Tribunal acknowledges the real difficulty of assuming under the prima facie standard the truth of a disputed fact unique to a jurisdictional objection which, if jurisdiction were then assumed and exercised, is never again addressed by the Tribunal during the arbitration proceedings.\n\n4.10.\n\nThis difficulty was best expressed by Sir Frank Berman in his dissenting opinion in *Lucchetti v Peru2* : \"It is one thing to say that factual matters can or should be provisionally accepted at the preliminary phase, because there will be a full opportunity to put them to the test definitively later on. But if particular facts are a critical element in the establishment of jurisdiction itself, so that the decision to accept or to deny jurisdiction disposes of them once and for all for this purpose, how can it be seriously claimed that those facts should be assumed rather than proved?\" (paragraph 17). The Tribunal agrees with this question's implicit answer; and, to this extent, the Tribunal accepts the submission made by the Respondent.\n\n*Lucchetti v Peru*, Dissenting Opinion of Sir Franklin Berman, para. 17.\n\n4.11.\n\nAccordingly, in summary, the Tribunal's general approach in deciding the Respondent's jurisdictional objections under the prima facie standard here requires an assumption of the truth of the relevant facts alleged by the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration (subject to the qualifications described above), excluding however a disputed fact uniquely relevant to the existence or exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. As to such disputed fact, the Tribunal is required either finally decide that factual issue here (if it can) or address it later pursuant to Article 21.4 (second sentence) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. As to the actual merits of the Claimants' claims or the likely defences of the Respondent, the Tribunal is required not finally to decide here any legal or factual issues arising thereunder, including the question whether, even if the Claimants' alleged facts were proven true, the Claimants would be entitled under the BIT and the Arbitration Agreement to the relief claimed by either of them in respect of any of their claims pleaded against the Respondent.\n\n***(C) Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------\n\n4.12.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT because the Parties' dispute does not arise out of or relate to an \"investment\" in Ecuador, for the purposes of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT. The Parties' respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1.31ff & 119 and D2. 254, 333 & 340.\n\n4.13.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the broad definition of \"investment\" contained in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, listing a wide variety of different forms (\"\u2018investment' means every kind of investment....\"); and Article I(3) also provides that any subsequent alteration in the form of in which assets are invested or reinvested \"shall not affect their character as investment.\" The BIT imposes no temporal limit on an investment: Article II(3)(b) confers express protection on the \"disposal\" of an investment; and Article II(7) likewise in regard to \"effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment auhorizations\". There is no reason in the wording of this BIT to limit the lifespan of a covered investment short of its complete and final demise, including the completion of all means for asserting claims and enforcing rights by the investor or others in regard to that investment.\n\n4.14.\n\n*TexPet:* It is appropriate to consider first the position of TexPet, before considering Chevron's separate position.\n\n4.15.\n\nAs alleged by the Claimants, TexPet began its investment in Ecuador in 1964 and continued its investments under the 1973 Concession Agreement. In the Tribunal's view, that investment did not terminate in 1992 (upon that Concession Agreement's ending) because there is a close and inextricable link between TexPet's 1973 Concession Agreement and the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Without the former, the latter would not have come into existence. It is also plain from the text of both the 1973 Concession Agreement (especially section 46) and the 1995 Settlement Agreement that the latter must be read with the earlier concession agreement and the Consortium's activities thereunder: the 1995 Settlement Agreement cross-refers repeatedly to the 1973 Concession Agreement: see its Preamble and Articles 1.1, 1.2, 1.12, 5.1, and 5.2.\n\n4.16.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore determines that, for the purpose of applying Article VI(1)(c), it is not possible to divorce one from the other. To the contrary, it is necessary to treat the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a continuation of the earlier concession agreements, so that it forms part of the overall investment invoked by TexPet. The Tribunal also notes that the BIT's requirement addresses not a concession agreement but an investment which can, by its nature and form, precede and (as here) follow the contractual term of a concession agreement. An investment can undergo several successive phases not chronologically coterminous with a concession agreement or concession.\n\n4.17.\n\nIt is also clear to the Tribunal from the complaint in the *Lago Agrio* litigation that its principal subject-matter addresses the alleged activities of TexPet under these concession agreements, with the complaint alleging several breaches of the 1973 Concession Agreement, especially paragraphs IV(7) & IV(9). There is, on the facts alleged by TexPet, a similar factor linking those concession agreements to the institution of the Respondent's criminal proceedings against Chevron's two lawyers. As regards the continued existence of TexPet's investment, that common subject-matter links the complaint and criminal proceedings not only to these concession agreements but also to the related 1995 Settlement Agreement between TexPet and the Respondent.\n\n4.18.\n\nAt this point, in addition to its more traditional form, TexPet's investment assumes the forms set out in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT as: \"a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment\" and \"any right conferred by... contract\". In the Tribunal's view, assuming its case were to prevail, TexPet's remedies under the BIT in regard to such forms of investment (given its original investment) are not limited in this arbitration to compensatory damages for its own damage but could also include (as a matter of jurisdiction) its declaratory and other non-compensatory relief as a named signatory party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n4.19.\n\nAccordingly, applying these interpretations of the BIT, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's jurisdictional objections against TexPet's claims under the BIT in this arbitration by reference to Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT. TexPet's investment began in 1964, it includes the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and, with the *Lago Agrio* litigation, that investment has not yet reached its complete and final demise.\n\n4.20.\n\nAs a co-claimant in this arbitration, the Tribunal therefore decides that TexPet has standing (as a matter of jurisdiction) to seek its claimed declaratory, specific performance, moral damages and other relief against the Respondent, even though TexPet is not a defendant in the *Lago Agro* litigation (or a defendant in the criminal proceedings). As an investor with a covered investment and as a contractual party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement with the Respondent, TexPet enjoys valuable economic rights for itself; and its claimed relief can thus include relief advanced under Articles I(1)(a)(v), Article II(3)(c), Article I(1)(a)(iii) and Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.\n\n4.21.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached this decision on the basis of its interpretation of the BIT's wording, together with the facts of this case, both assumed and non-disputed between the Parties. Having made that decision independently, the Tribunal notes, however, that its approach regarding the overall life-span of an investment materially accords with the reasoning of other tribunals in *Commercial Cases Dispute, Saipem v Bangladesh, Mondev v USA, Frontier Petroleum Services v Czech Republic* and *White Industries v India.*\n\n4.22.\n\n*Chevron:* The Tribunal considers that additional considerations arise in regard to Chevron. Chevron made no investment under any of TexPet's concession agreements; it was never a member of the Consortium; it was not a signatory or named party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and it first appears in this case's chronology in 2001 following its \"merger\" with Texaco.\n\n4.23.\n\nOn these facts alone, the Tribunal would not consider that Chevron could successfully plead any investment under the BIT for the purpose of establishing this Tribunal's jurisdiction over its claims in this arbitration; and, if its case stopped there, this Tribunal might decline jurisdiction over Chevron's claims under Article VI(1)(c) - subject only to Chevron's residual argument that it can still bring its claims as the indirect owner of TexPet.\n\n4.24.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as TexPet's parent company, Chevron is a covered investor under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT because it indirectly owns or controls an \"investment\" in Ecuador. It is not disputed that Chevron is a company \"of the other Party\" formed in the USA; and Article 1(1)(a) does not require its indirect investment (i.e. in TexPet and its investment) to be a company formed in Ecuador. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides, as a matter of jurisdiction, that Chevron can bring its claims before this Tribunal for an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by the BIT with respect to its indirect \"investment\" in TexPet.\n\n4.25.\n\nA different issue arises from Chevron's exposure to the liability to the plaintiffs in the *Lago Agrio* litigation. Chevron became TexPet's parent and thus an investor in 2001 only, long after the events said to give rise to Chevron's liability and occurring at a time when Texaco (not Chevron) was TexPet's parent company. Notwithstanding their ostensibly distinct legal personalities and corporate histories, the *Lago Agrio* litigation appears completely to amalgamate Chevron with Texaco (for legal reasons which remain unclear to the Tribunal). In that event, Chevron here submits for jurisdictional purposes that it should be treated by this Tribunal as, effectively, standing in the shoes of Texaco, as TexPet's parent company from 1964 onwards, with the same original investment indirectly made and continued by Texaco. Otherwise, so Chevron submits, the Respondent and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs could succeed unfairly in \"having it both ways\": with Chevron liable in the Lago Agrio litigation because of the concession/investment made by Texaco & TexPet but with Chevron not entitled in this arbitration to assert any relief because it had in fact no such investment/concession at the material time, i.e. before 2001.\n\n4.26.\n\nThe Tribunal declines to cut this Gordian knot at this early stage of these arbitration proceedings: it will need a much better understanding of the legal reasons why Chevron is to be treated in the *Lago Agrio* litigation as a party succeeding to Texaco's liabilities which arose before the \"merger\" in 2001; and it will also need a clearer understanding of what constituted such \"merger\" as regards the different and successive legal relationships between Texaco, TexPet and Chevron before and after such \"merger\", under whatever applicable law or laws, namely the laws of the USA and/or Ecuadorian law.\n\n4.27.\n\nAccordingly, for the time being, the Tribunal makes no final decision in regard to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection to Chevron's own claims as a direct investor under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, save to join that particular objection to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. In addition, the Tribunal's jurisdictional decision to treat Chevron as an indirect investor should not be understood as indicating (one way or the other) that Chevron would be entitled to all the relief claimed by Chevron in paragraph 547 of the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits (cited in Part I above). That is also a matter for the merits phase of this arbitration.\n\n4.28.\n\n*Res Judicata and Issue Preclusion:* Given these decisions, the Tribunal need not here address the Parties' respective submissions regarding res judicata or issue preclusion and the awards in the arbitration known as the *Commercial Cases Dispute*. It is unnecessary to decide this question as regards TexPet, given the Tribunal's decision in its favour above. As regards Chevron, however, this question may remain relevant, but for two reasons, the Tribunal declines to decide it here. First, the answer, even if completely favourable to Chevron, may be legally irrelevant and leave untouched other issues relevant to Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT; and, second, in the Tribunal's view, this question of res judicata raises issues of Dutch law which are better resolved as part of the merits at a later stage of these arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, this question of res judicata (with issue preclusion) is not here decided by the Tribunal but joined to the merits, if and to the extent relevant, pursuant to Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n4.29.\n\n*Estoppel and Preclusion:* Likewise, Chevron's other submissions based on estoppel, preclusion and good faith arising from the Respondent's alleged conduct in regard to the *Lagio Agri* o litigation and criminal proceedings are similarly joined to the merits pursuant to Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n***(C) Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------\n\n4.30.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT because the Parties' dispute does not \"arise out of or relate to an investment agreement\" between the Respondent and the Claimants, for the purpose of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. The Parties' respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and their principal oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1.69, 114 & 164. These oral submissions overlap with their submissions under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, given their disputed definition of investment, particularly as regards Chevron's alleged investment agreement. The Tribunal notes at the outset that there is no definition of \"investment agreement\" in the BIT. It is again appropriate consider separately the positions of TexPet and Chevron.\n\n4.31.\n\n*TexPet:* In the Tribunal's view, the 1973 Concession Agreement was an \"investment agreement\" within the meaning of Article VI(1(a) of the BIT. TexPet, as a named party to this agreement with the Respondent, made investments in Ecuador, as both alleged by the Claimants and indeed acknowledged by the Respondent (Memorial on Jurisdiction, paragraph 47).\n\n4.32.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, having already decided above upon the broad interpretation of \"investment\" under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, there is an inextricable link between the 1973 Concession Agreement and the 1995 Settlement Agreement, to which TexPet and the Respondent were named and signatory parties. Again, the latter would not have come into existence without the former; and, accordingly, the Tribunal similarly determines that, for the purpose of applying Article VI(1)(a), it is not possible to divorce one from the other. In the Tribunal's view, the 1995 Settlement Agreement must be treated as a continuation of the earlier concession agreement, so that it also forms part of the overall \"investment agreement\" invoked by TexPet under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n4.33.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Respondent's argument that the 1995 Settlement Agreement came too long after the expiry of the 1973 Concession Agreement, some three years later (in 1992). In the Tribunal's view, there could be no doubt that if the 1995 Settlement Agreement had been made during the contractual term of the 1973 Concession Agreement (say in 1975), it could only have been regarded as an elaboration of that agreement and thus clearly forming part of one overall investment agreement. A long term oil concession must inevitably involve extensive clean-up costs and related responsibilities to others for the environmental consequences of its activities, particularly at or after the end of such activities. It is also well known scientifically that the consequences of environmental pollution caused by oil production are generally measured over many years, if not several decades. As the Claimants' Counsel rightly submitted at the Jurisdictional Hearing: \"Environmental remediation is a normal and natural part of an oil concession project\" (D1,129).\n\n4.34.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses any chronological distinction between remedial agreements made the day before and the day after the expiry of a concession agreement; and there is equally no logical reason to treat differently a much longer period after the concession's agreement expiry, so long as the same link remains between them (as is the case here).\n\n4.35.\n\nMoreover, the requirement for an \"investment dispute\" under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT (which introduces the Arbitration Agreement) is broadly defined to mean a dispute \"arising out of or relating to\" an investment agreement. In the Tribunal's view, such wording would not limit an investment dispute to one only arising under a particular investment agreement but would include a wider range of disputes \"relating to\" the investment agreement. In the Tribunal's view, TexPet's claims under the BIT do \"relate\" to the 1973 Concession Agreement, even if (contrary to the Tribunal's decision above) the 1973 Concession Agreement were to be isolated from the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the Parties' dispute did not arise under or even \"out of\" that concession agreement at all.\n\n4.36.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is not minded to treat the 1995 Settlement Agreement, by itself or (in the Claimants' phrase) free-standing, as an \"investment agreement\" under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. It was of course an \"agreement\" whereby TexPet in fact incurred substantial expenditure and paid significant monies to actual and putative claimants in Ecuador; but TexPet's activities thereunder cannot fairly be described, by themselves, as having been made as an \"investment\". These activities were, as rightly submitted by the Respondent, performed by way of amicable settlements for past actual or alleged wrongs and not for investment purposes. Accordingly, standing alone, the Tribunal rejects the 1995 Settlement Agreement as founding its jurisdiction; and it is only when that 1995 Settlement is considered along with the 1973 Concession Agreement that it forms part of an \"investment agreement\" under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. In arriving at this decision, the Tribunal found little assistance (either way) from the Parties' different submissions regarding the USA's treaty practices and related doctrinal writings.\n\n4.37.\n\nOn the basis that TexPet's dispute with the Respondent under the BIT relates to an investment agreement, consisting of the 1973 Concession Agreement either by itself or together with the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's jurisdictional objection under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT as regards TexPet's claims in this arbitration. In particular, the Tribunal does not consider that TexPet's claims relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement under the BIT and international law are barred by Ecuadorian law as a matter of jurisdiction; e.g. Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (also \"CC\").\n\n4.38.\n\n*Chevron:* In the Tribunal's view, additional considerations again apply to Chevron, because it was not a party to any concession agreement; and it was not a named or signatory party in the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Indeed, Chevron was not a named or signatory party to any contractual agreement made with the Respondent before the commencement of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n4.39.\n\nThe first issue is whether Chevron, under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, can assert contractual rights against the Respondent as a \"Releasee\" under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. There is no provision in the 1995 Settlement Agreement regarding its applicable law or its authoritative language (as between its English and Spanish versions); and Article 9.3 contains a \"whole contract\" provision. The Tribunal also notes that Article 9.6 provides that the 1995 Settlement Agreement substitutes and voids the 1994 MOU.\n\n4.40.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this first issue is answered by the mere fact that Chevron was not a contractual party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement at the time when it was signed by TexPet and the Respondent. In the Tribunal's view, as considered above, the broad language of Article VI(1) of the BIT (\"relating to\") does not require such original contractual privity between Chevron and the Respondent; and moreover the term \"between\" in Article VI(1)(a) cannot be interpreted as requiring Chevron to be an actual signatory or named party to the investment agreement. However, the Tribunal does consider that Article VI of the BIT requires Chevron to be entitled to assert contractual or other legal rights against the Respondent under the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a \"Releasee\". The Parties' experts on Ecuadorian law agree that a \"Releasee\" can enforce the 1995 Settlement Agreement (by its terms and Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code); and the question is therefore whether or not Chevron became such a Releasee in or after its \"merger\" with Texaco in 2001.\n\n4.41.\n\nThe English version of Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement contains a long list of persons described as \"Releasees\", including TexPet's and Texaco's respective \"successors\" and \"principals and subsidiaries\". The latter term appears to relate to an agency relationship; and it does not thus self-evidently describe, in the Tribunal's view, Chevron as TexPet's later parent. The former term (\"successors\") might be more apt depending upon Chevron's \"merger\" with Texaco; but that is not a submission apparently made by Chevron, perhaps for reasons associated with the *Lago Agrio* litigation [D1,207 & D2,289]. The Tribunal notes that this contractual list does not expressly include parent or associated companies, although TexPet's then parent company (Texaco) was expressly included amongst the named Releasees.\n\n4.42.\n\nGiven its centre of gravity, for present purposes, the Tribunal here relies principally upon the Spanish text and Ecuadorian law, as submitted by the Parties. The question of this text's contractual interpretation was addressed in written reports by the Parties' respective legal experts on Ecuadorian law: Dr Barros and Dr Coronel for the Claimants and Dr Salgado for the Respondent.\n\n4.43.\n\nThe Parties' experts there closely examined the precise meaning of the Spanish word \"principales\" in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Dr Barros and Dr Coronel support the Claimants' submissions, to the effect that \"principales\" means parent company (See Dr Barros' second report; and Dr Coronel's second report). With that interpretation, since Chevron has indirectly owned and controlled TexPet since 2001, Chevron would therefore be a \"Releasee\", contractually and legally entitled to seek declaratory and other relief against the Respondent under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n4.44.\n\nDr Barros' report (paragraphs. 23-35) also places special emphasis on the fact that the terms \"principales y subsidiarias\" are used in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Dr. Barros expresses the opinion that in such a context \"principales\" does not refer to the principal-agent relationship under the law of agency, but to the parent or controlling company/subsidiary relationship under company law. Amongst other factors, Dr. Barros indicates that: (i) if the signatory parties had wished to use the term \"principales\" according to the meaning to be assigned to such a term in an agency relationship (\"principal\" or \"mandante\"), they would have mentioned it together with the term \"agents\" (\"agentes\" or \"mandatarios\") in Article 5.1 - which significantly was not the case (paragraph 26 of Dr. Barros' report); and (ii) a harmonious and good faith interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement militates against construing the release as only covering companies or persons in the ownership structure (including TexPet), as such structure then existed and not also companies or persons that were to come into the structure at a later date (paragraphs 31 & 33 of the Barros report). Dr Barros points out that a contrary interpretation of Article 5.1 would mean that TexPet's officers when the release was signed would be covered as Releasees but not TexPet's future officers who could be still be exposed to liabilities; and that such reading does not make any sense (paragraph 29).\n\n4.45.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by Dr Coronel's report. Dr Coronel also expresses the opinion that with the parties' use of the words \"principales\" and \"subsidiarias\" together, Article 5.1 should be read to mean that companies above and below those mentioned by name in this provision are to be covered by the release (paragraph 19). Dr. Coronel also refers specifically to Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code3 and also Article 1562 CC4, Article 1576 CC5, Article 1578 CC6, Article 1580 CC7 (paragraphs 11-150).\n\n*\"Cualquiera puede estipular a favor de una tercera persona, aunque no tenga derecho para representarla;* *pero s\u00f3lo esa tercera persona podr\u00e1 demander lo estipulado; y mientras no intervenga su aceptaci\u00f3n expresa o t\u00e1cita, es revocable el contrato por la sola voluntad de las partes que concurrieron a \u00e9l. Constituyen aceptaci\u00f3n t\u00e1cita los actos que s\u00f3lo hubieran podido ejecutarse en virtud del contrato\".*\n\n*\"Los contratos deben ejecutarse de buena fe, y por consiguiente obligan, no s\u00f3lo a lo que en ellos se expresa, sino a todas las cosas que emanan precisamente de la naturaleza de la obligaci\u00f3n, o que, por la ley o costumbre, pertenecen a ella\".*\n\n*\"Conocida claramente la intenci\u00f3n de los contratantes debe estarse a ella m\u00e1s que a lo literal de las* *palabras\".*\n\n*\"El sentido en que una cl\u00e1usula puede surtir alg\u00fan efecto deber\u00e1 preferirse a aqu\u00e9l en que no sea capaz de* *surtir efecto alguno\".*\n\n*\"Las cl\u00e1usulas de un contrato se interpretar\u00e1n unas por otras, d\u00e1ndose a cada una el sentido que mejor* *convenga al contrato en su totalidad. Podr\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n interpretarse por las de otro contrato entre las mismas* *partes y sobre la misma materia. O por la aplicaci\u00f3n pr\u00e1ctica que hayan hecho de ella ambas partes, o una de* *las partes con aprobaci\u00f3n de la otra\"*\n\n4.46.\n\nBy relying upon Articles 1576 CC and 1580 CC, Dr. Coronel states that a joint reading of the definition of \"release\" (\"liberaci\u00f3n\") found at Articles 1.12 and 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement confirms the intention of the parties not only to release TexPet but also \"all persons and entities related to TexPet \" (paragraph 20). The main thrust of his opinion seems to be that Article 1.12 broadly extends the release to all legal and contractual obligations and *responsibility* vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent and PetroEcuador resulting from the consortium's operations and relating to the environment (not limited to TexPet), and that the broad list of related entities covered by Article 5.1 evinces the parties' intention to extend the release to companies or entities or persons not there expressly mentioned or identified by name.\n\n4.47.\n\nIn particular, Dr Coronel states that: (a) the release covers Texaco, then the indirect owning and controlling company of TexPet, which means that it must also extend to companies becoming in the future the indirect owning and controlling companies of TexPet (i.e. Chevron); and (b) the reference to \"successors\" in Article 5.1 indicates that companies not expressly listed by name in its text could still benefit legally from the release. Dr Coronel states that when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was made, it was impossible for the signatory parties to know or even predict that Chevron (or anybody else) would become the owning and controlling company of TexPet. Since the highest parent corporation at that time was expressly covered by the release, a logical and good faith reading of this provision requires its coverage to any future company replacing Texaco as TexPet's parent (paragraph 20). In that sense (and only in that sense), Chevron is a \"successor\" of Texaco; i.e., Texaco was replaced with Chevron as the indirect owning and controlling shareholder of TexPet within the meaning of Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n4.48.\n\nNeither Dr Barros' report nor Dr Coronel's report denies that the Spanish term \"principales\" outside the specific context in which such term is used in Article 5.1 and within the context of an agency relationship means \"principal\" or \"mandante\". In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola defines \"principal\" as follows: (i) 19th Edition (1970): \"For. El que da poder a otro para que lo represente, poderdante\"; and (ii) 22nd (last) Edition (2001): \"Der. Poderdante\" [i.e., within a legal context - this is what the references For. or Der. stand for]. \"Principal\" means who grants a power of attorney in fact.\"\n\n4.49.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal notes that examples in which such term has been used in the context of general company or corporate law in Ecuador are very exceptional, as shown in the report of the Respondent's legal expert, Dr. Roberto Salgado Valdez (the \"Salgado report\"). However, the Salgado report does not go further than addressing the usual legal meaning of the term *\"principal\".* It does not analyse the question of what exactly the signatory parties themselves objectively intended by their use of that term in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and the Tribunal has not been shown any legal materials refuting the possibility of the contextual interpretation advanced in the Barros and Coronel reports based upon such intention. Although the Respondent disputes these experts' interpretation, it appears to rely only upon its own reading of the meaning only of \"principales\" out of context.8 The Salgado report limits itself to denying the Claimants' interpretation in only one paragraph (paragraph 20), exclusively on the basis of the isolated meaning of \"principal\" (with no context) and without analysing the reasoning in the Coronel report or the Barros report.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paragraphs. 93-99. Reply, paragraphs. 127-132 ; and Jurisdiction Hearing D1.75- 81.\n\n4.50.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, although clause VIII of the 1994 MOU provides that its stipulations do not limit third-party rights arising out of the operations of the Consortium, Article 9.6 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement clearly provides that it substitutes and voids the MOU. Further, Article 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement does grant releases to third parties not specifically identified by name which is incompatible, on its face, with clause VIII of the 1994 MOU. These circumstances militate in favour of not assigning interpretative weight to the MOU when interpreting the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n4.51.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement provides that it shall not be construed to confer any benefit on any \"third party not a Party to this Contract\", nor grant any rights to \"such third party\" to enforce its provisions.9 The term \"Party\" excludes Chevron as a non-signatory party. This significant provision was of course much invoked by the Respondent. Indeed, the Tribunal considers that, if Chevron were not a Releasee, Chevron must be treated as a third party which is not legally entitled to claim any benefit under the 1995 Settlement Agreement or to enforce its provisions against the Respondent. If Chevron were, however, a \"Releasee\" (as the Claimants submit), the question arises whether Chevron is a \"third party\" at all. The Claimants contend that Article 5.1 effectively grants benefits to parties which are not named or signatory parties and that Article 9.4 should be interpreted harmoniously with Article 5.1 so as to avoid making the releases meaningless. The Tribunal, whilst not finally deciding this question, considers that the Claimants' answer is sufficiently serious to require further consideration at the merits phase of this arbitration.\n\n*\"No se deber\u00e1 inferir que este Contrato conferir\u00e1 beneficios a terceros que no sean parte de este Contrato, ni tampoco que proporcionar\u00e1 derechos a terceros para hacer cumplir sus provisiones\":* see the Memorial on Jurisdiction, at paragraphs 98-99.\n\n4.52.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Dr Salgado acknowledges that the meaning of Article 5.1 depends ultimately on the intention of the signatory parties, here TexPet and the Respondent. This approach appears to accord with the approach taken by Dr Barros and Dr Coronel. In the Tribunal's view, those parties' objective intention may therefore provide the answer to this important question; but, again, it is not a question which the Tribunal can properly answer at this early stage of this arbitration, not without affording to the Respondent the requisite opportunity to adduce relevant and admissible evidence as to such an objective intention. (The Tribunal has noted, as earlier indicated, the \"Whole Contract\" provision in Article 9.3 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement).\n\n4.53.\n\nIn summary, applying the prima facie standard described above, the Tribunal decides for present purposes that the Claimants' interpretation, supported by two legal experts, is at least \"serious\"; but the Tribunal does not otherwise here finally decide the question one way or the other. Given that this question is a mixed question relevant both to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT and the merits of Chevron's claim relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal decides to join the Respondent's objection to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n4.54.\n\n*Res Judicata, Issue Preclusion and Estoppel:* As with Article VI(1)(c) above, the Tribunal considers it inappropriate here to decide these questions under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. Similarly, it joins these issues, if and insofar as they may remain relevant to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to Chevron's claims, to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n***(D) No Prima Facie Case***\n-----------------------------\n\n4.55.\n\nThe Respondent next submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT because the Claimants have no prima facie case on the merits of their claims. The Parties' respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and in several parts of their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing.\n\n4.56.\n\nApplying the standard of review described above, the Tribunal specifically rejects this separate jurisdictional objection. Given that this arbitration will now proceed further in regard to the respective merits of the Parties' dispute and that the Respondent has yet had no opportunity to plead its defence on the merits, it is appropriate for the Tribunal here to add very little.\n\n4.57.\n\nThere is no doubt in the Tribunal's mind that the allegations pleaded by the Claimants against the Respondent rank amongst the gravest accusations which can be advanced by a claimant against a modern State subject to the rule of law. There is equally no doubt that these allegations are deeply offensive and repellent to the Respondent. The Tribunal refers to the opening statements made respectively by Chevron's General Counsel and the Respondent's Attorney-General, set out above in Part III of this Award.\n\n4.58.\n\nThe Claimants' allegations may be completely false or completely true. As yet, the Tribunal has formed no concluded view on any these contested allegations one way or the other. Its decision in this Award is limited to the required application of the prima facie standard under the BIT and Arbitration Agreement to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections; and for this limited purpose it has concluded that the Claimants' pleaded case is serious and not advanced in bad faith; nor is its case incredible, frivolous or vexatious.\n\n***(E) Third Party Rights and Monetary Gold***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n4.59.\n\nThe Parties' respective submissions are summarised above in Part III of this Award and their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1,101 & 227 and D2,262 & 353.\n\n4.60.\n\nUnder international law, the *Monetary Gold* principle articulated by the International Court of Justice stipulates, in essence, that although a tribunal may have jurisdiction over a dispute it must not or should not exercise that jurisdiction if the very subject-matter of the decision would determine the rights and obligations of a State which is not a party to the proceedings. There is disagreement between the Parties concerning the applicability of the principle to mixed (State/Non-State) arbitrations under bilateral investment treaties and to circumstances in which a tribunal adjudicating upon the liability of a State may have to consider matters that are the subject of litigation between private persons. The Tribunal does not, however, have to decide that disagreement, because it considers that even if the *Monetary Gold* principle should be applicable in this arbitration it would not operate so as to prevent the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over the Parties' dispute. The following paragraphs explain the Tribunal's reasoning, assuming (for the sake of argument) that the principle should be applicable here.\n\n4.61.\n\nAs the Parties to the present dispute have recognized, the *Monetary Gold* principle draws its strength from, and implements, a number of distinct and fundamental principles of international law. Most obviously, it gives effect to the principle that no international tribunal may exercise jurisdiction over a State without the consent of that State; and, by analogy, no arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over any person unless they have consented. That may be called the \u2018consent' principle, and it goes to the question of the tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n4.62.\n\nIn the *Monetary Gold* case itself, the International Court of Justice held that, as a corollary of the \u2018consent' principle, if the very subject-matter of the case that it has to decide is a question of the rights of a State not before it, the International Court cannot proceed to decide that case. In such a case, the Court would not hear full argument on the rights in question. That corollary may be called the \u2018indispensible third party' principle; and it goes to the question of the ability of the tribunal to decide the case justly and according to law.\n\n4.63.\n\nThere is also a concern that the rights of States should not be ruled upon unless they are properly before the Court and are given a full opportunity to present their case. This third aspect may be called the \u2018due process' principle; and it goes to the question of the rights of the absent third party.\n\n4.64.\n\nAll three aspects of the *Monetary Gold* principle are reflected in the submissions of the Parties to this Tribunal. The *Lago Agrio* litigation has, as a central issue, the question of the legal effect (if any) of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That is also a question before this Tribunal; but the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not named parties to these arbitration proceedings. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the *Monetary Gold* principle applies to the present arbitration, all three of its aspects need to be considered.\n\n4.65.\n\nFirst, the \u2018consent' principle: it is clear that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Lago Agrio plaintiffs themselves. That is the case both in the context of applications for interim measures and in the context of any further proceedings on the merits in this arbitration. One consequence is that the Tribunal has no legal authority over the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and cannot order them to do or to abstain from doing anything. At most, the Tribunal could request the Lago Agrio plaintiffs to follow a certain course of action. On the other hand, the Tribunal does have jurisdiction over Chevron and TexPet as Co-Claimants and also (subject to its jurisdictional objections) over the Respondent in this arbitration, under the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n4.66.\n\nSecond, the \u2018indispensible third party' principle. This is more complicated. A decision that the 1995 Settlement Agreement releases Chevron and TexPet from all liability in respect of environmental harm in Ecuador would appear to entail the conclusion that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs could not succeed in their litigation against Chevron in respect of environmental harm in Ecuador. Indeed, this Tribunal is formally requested, in the Claimants' prayer for relief (cited in Part I above), to make a series of decisions that are explicitly or implicitly premised upon a particular view of the legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In that sense, if there were a decision by the Tribunal in this arbitration that the 1995 Settlement Agreement releases Chevron from all liability, that might be said to decide the legal rights of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. But that is something that depends upon the form and content of the decision of this Tribunal: it is not an inevitable consequence of the Tribunal exercising its jurisdiction. The question of form and content of the decision is a matter to be addressed during the merits phase of this case.\n\n4.67.\n\nIt is clear that this Tribunal has only to decide upon questions of the Respondent's liability to the Claimants under the BIT. In so far as it is relevant to the *Monetary Gold* point, the question for this Tribunal is whether the Respondent is, by virtue of that treaty, under an obligation to the Claimants to act so as to uphold the efficacy of the terms of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as those terms are interpreted by the Claimants. It may be that the answer to that question is that the Respondent is indeed under such an obligation; and that the decisions of the Ecuadorian Courts are incompatible with that obligation. But that answer would not decide the question of the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as between the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and Chevron. If there were an inconsistency between the Respondent's obligations under the BIT and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' rights as determined by the Courts in Ecuador, it would be for the Respondent to decide how to resolve that inconsistency. On this analysis, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs cannot here be regarded as indispensible third parties; and this case can properly proceed to the merits of the Claimants' claims without them.\n\n4.68.\n\nThird, the \u2018due process' principle: it is possible that even though the Lago Agrio plaintiffs may not be indispensible third parties to this arbitration, a decision by this Tribunal may nonetheless have a significant effect upon their legal rights and interests. The question therefore arises of the extent to which the principle of due process, in relation to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, may be brought to bear in this context by the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n4.69.\n\nAt this stage, the question is to be answered in the context of the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction. It is, moreover, a question to be answered in the light of the rights of due process possessed by the Parties to this arbitration. Due process is a principle that bears, at least primarily, upon the manner in which jurisdiction is exercised by a tribunal, rather than upon the very existence of that jurisdiction. It is not necessary for this Tribunal to decide if there is a theoretical possibility that due process rights of a third party, not a party to the proceedings and not subject to the jurisdiction ratione personae of an arbitral tribunal, might in some extraordinary case be argued to operate so as to deprive persons who undoubtedly are parties to the proceedings and within the jurisdiction ratione personae of the tribunal of their right to a hearing and to due process. That is plainly not the case here.\n\n4.70.\n\nThe question for this Tribunal is in essence whether the Respondent has or has not violated rights of the Claimants under the BIT because of the way in which the Respondent has, through its organs, acted in relation to the settlement agreements. The question is one of the rights and obligations existing between the Claimants and the Respondent; and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, who are not parties to the settlement agreements or to the BIT, do not have rights that are directly engaged by that question. If it should transpire that the Respondent has, by concluding the Release Agreements, taken a step which had the legal effect of depriving the Lago Agrio plaintiffs of rights under Ecuadorian Law that they might otherwise have enjoyed, that would be a matter between them and the Respondent, and not a matter for this Tribunal.\n\n4.71.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides to reject this part of the Respondent's objections based upon Third Party Rights.\n\n***(F) Fork in the Road***\n--------------------------\n\n4.72.\n\nThe BIT's fork in the road provision appears in Article VI(3) of the BIT, the material parts of which are set out in Part II above. The Parties' respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1.86 & 184 and D2. 294.\n\n4.73.\n\nThe question is whether \"the dispute\" submitted to this Tribunal has already been submitted to the national courts of Ecuador or New York so as to trigger the fork in the road provision in Article VI(3). There is no suggestion that the Parties have agreed to any other settlement procedure under Article VI(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n4.74.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, \"the dispute\" in this context must mean \"the same dispute\": it is not suggested that the submission of a different dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent could trigger the fork in the road provision in relation to the Parties' dispute before this Tribunal. Plainly, what is literally one and the same dispute cannot be before two tribunals simultaneously. \u2018Sameness' must refer to material identity or sameness determined in the context of a fork in the road provision. The question is therefore: what is required to establish this particular \u2018sameness'?\n\n4.75.\n\nTribunals in earlier investment cases have applied a \u2018triple identity' test, requiring that in the dispute before the domestic courts and the dispute before the arbitration tribunal there should be identity of the parties, of the object, and of the cause of action. In the present case, there is no identity of parties, of object or of cause of action between the *Lago Agrio* litigation or, indeed, in the *Aguinda* litigation in the New York Courts.\n\n4.76.\n\nIt is unlikely that the triple identity test will be satisfied in many cases where a dispute before a tribunal against a State under a BIT and based upon an alleged breach of the BIT is compared with a dispute in a national court. National legal systems do not commonly provide for the State to be sued in respect of a breach of treaty as such, even though actions for breach of a national law giving effect to a treaty might be possible. A strict application of the triple identity test would deprive the fork in the road provision of all or most of its practical effect.\n\n4.77.\n\nThe triple identity test was developed to address questions of res judicata and to identify specific issues that have already been determined by a competent tribunal. It has also been applied to similar questions arising in the broadly comparable context of lis pendens. It is not clear that the triple identity test should be applied here in order to determine if it is the same \u2018dispute' that is being submitted to national courts and to the arbitration tribunal. It is, however, not necessary for the Tribunal to decide this question, because there is a more fundamental point arising from the wording of the BIT itself.\n\n4.78.\n\nThe short answer to the fork in the road issue in the present case is that the fork is stated by Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT to be inapplicable if the \"national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution.\" Those words require that, for the fork to be applied, not only must the dispute have been submitted for resolution but also that the dispute was submitted by the \"national or company concerned\" for resolution in the national courts.\n\n4.79.\n\nIn this case, the dispute before the Courts of Ecuador was not submitted by the Claimants but by the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. One Claimant (Chevron) before the arbitration tribunal is the defendant before the Courts of Ecuador. The other (TexPet) is not a party to the *Lago Agrio* litigation at all. Whatever might be the position in respect of differently-worded fork in the road provisions in other BITs, it is clear that the Claimants in this case have not themselves submitted the dispute before this Tribunal to any other court or tribunal. The same reasoning applies to the legal proceedings before the New York Courts, even if a submission to those Courts could trigger the BIT's fork in the road provision at all (as opposed to its continuation before the Ecuadorian Courts, as submitted by the Respondent).\n\n4.80.\n\nThat is a sufficient answer to the fork in the road issue, but only within its own limits; i.e., only insofar as it is true that the Claimants have not themselves submitted the dispute to the Courts of Ecuador or New York. It is arguable that if some part of the dispute before this Tribunal were to have been submitted to the national courts, for example by way of a counterclaim, that part of the dispute would be subject to the fork in the road provision.\n\n4.81.\n\nIt is the Claimant's prayer for relief in the *Lago Agrio* litigation that must be scrutinised and compared to the Claimants' claims pleaded in this arbitration (as to the merits) in order to determine whether the former contains any elements that have the character of counterclaims or which are for some other reason exceptions to the observation that the Claimants have not themselves submitted that dispute to the Ecuadorian Courts. In this arbitration, the Claimants' prayer for relief is set out in paragraph 547 of the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, which is recited in full in Part I above.\n\n4.82.\n\nThe request in subparagraph 1 of paragraph 547 for a declaration that the Claimants have no liability or responsibility for environmental impact certainly corresponds to the defence raised in the *Lago Agrio* litigation. The raising of a plea in defence to a claim in the national courts, however, cannot properly be described as the submission of a dispute for settlement in those courts. The notion of \u2018submission' of a dispute connotes the making of a choice and a voluntary decision to refer the dispute to the court for resolution: as a matter of the plain and ordinary meaning of the term, it does not extend to the raising of a defence in response to another's claim submitted to that court.\n\n4.83.\n\nThe request in subparagraph 2 for a declaration that the Respondent has breached the BIT is not a matter before the national courts; nor (obviously) is the request in subparagraph 3 for a declaration that under the BIT and international law Chevron is not liable for any judgment rendered in the *Lago Agrio* litigation; nor the request in subparagraph 4 for a declaration that any judgment rendered against Chevron in that litigation is not final, conclusive or enforceable.\n\n4.84.\n\nThe request in subparagraph 5 for a declaration that the Respondent or PetroEcuador (or the Respondent and PetroEcuador jointly) are exclusively liable for any judgment rendered in the *Lago Agrio* litigation is, if strictly construed, a request relating not to the substantive rights and duties in issue in the Courts of Ecuador but a request relating to the distinct duties that the Respondent and Petroecuador would have in respect of any judgment in the *Lago Agrio* litigation.\n\n4.85.\n\nIt might be said that in effect this request invites the Tribunal to decide that the Respondent and/or PetroEcuador are liable for any environmental damage. That is a request that might be said to go beyond the simple defensive plea that Chevron (and TexPet) is (or are) not liable for any such damage. It might also be said to be a question that could be answered, at least impliedly, by the Lago Agrio Court's ruling on Chevron's defence based on the settlement agreements. It would, however, be a triumph of form over substance if this request in subparagraph 5, which is the direct corollary of the plea of non-liability under the 1995 Settlement Agreement at the heart of the Claimants' defence in the *Lago Agrio* litigation, were to be regarded as a dispute that had been submitted to the Courts of Ecuador by the Claimants, thus triggering the fork in the road provision. The Tribunal does not therefore take this formalistic approach to the Claimants' pleading in this arbitration.\n\n4.86.\n\nIt is unnecessary to deal in detail with the requests in subparagraphs 6 \u2013 12, which are patently not matters that the Claimants have submitted to the Ecuadorian Courts.\n\n4.87.\n\nThe request in subparagraph 13 for the recovery of the costs of defending the Lago Agrio litigation and seeks recovery of costs from the Respondent in this case, not from the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. Plainly, those costs cannot be recovered twice: but while further developments in the Lago Agrio litigation might affect the amount of any claim, they do not affect its admissibility in this arbitration.\n\n4.88.\n\nThe request in subparagraph 14 does not duplicate any claim in the Lago Agrio litigation; and nor do the requests in subparagraphs 15 and 16.\n\n4.89.\n\nThe Tribunal decides accordingly to reject the Respondent's case that the Claimants' claims before this Tribunal are precluded by the fork in the road provision in Article VI((3) of the BIT.\n\n***(G) Admissibility***\n-----------------------\n\n4.90.\n\nThe Tribunal has generally subsumed under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules the Respondent's objections as to the admissibility of the Claimants with its jurisdictional objections; and it is not therefore necessary to address them here separately, save for the following specific objections considered below.\n\n4.91.\n\nGenerally, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's objections to the admissibility of the Claimants' claims, where not amounting to or overlapping with its jurisdictional objections, should be treated under Articles 15 and 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as issues relating to the merits phase of these arbitration proceedings. The UNCITRAL Rules do not contain any provision equivalent to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). An objection to the admissibility of a claim does not, of course, impugn the jurisdiction of a tribunal over the disputing parties and their dispute; to the contrary, it necessarily assumes the existence of such jurisdiction; and it only objects to the tribunal's exercise of such jurisdiction in deciding the merits of a claim beyond a preliminary objection. Under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, that is an exercise belonging to the merits phase of the arbitration, to be decided by one or more awards on the merits.\n\n4.92.\n\nThe Respondent submits that material damage is essential to the Claimants' claims under the BIT in respect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and that, in the oral submission of the Respondent's Counsel at the jurisdiction hearing: \"... unless and until the Claimants are found liable to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs in a judgment not subject to appeal, there is no claim before this Tribunal that is ripe for adjudication\" [D1.65].\n\n4.93.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this submission is mistaken as regards the Claimants' claims for non-compensatory relief under the BIT; and it is also mistaken as a matter of legal principle as regards the claim for moral damages (see Article 31(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: \"Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State\"). As regards the Claimants' other claims for compensatory relief, it relates to the merits of the Parties' dispute because the Claimants' claims for damages are based upon injuries alleged caused by the Respondent's existing acts and omissions in breach of the BIT and are not exclusively dependent upon the eventual and final outcome of the *Lago Agrio* litigation.\n\n4.94.\n\nAs to the Respondent's related application to stay these arbitration proceedings \"until the Lago Agrio judgment is handed down and appeal's been heard\" [D1.67], the Respondent later acknowledged (rightly so, in the Tribunal's view) that the Tribunal could proceed with its decisions on jurisdiction as a matter of discretion under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (D2,253). Subsequent events have also made the Respondent's application otiose.\n\n***(H) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n4.95.\n\n*TexPet:* In conclusion, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal here decides, as regards TexPet's claims, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n4.96.\n\n*Chevron:* As to Chevron, the Tribunal decides to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in regard to Chevron's indirect investment (as TexPet's parent company owning and controlling TexPet) under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the BIT; the Tribunal decides to join to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules the objections made the Respondent as to jurisdiction in regard to Chevron's direct investment under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the BIT; and it decides to reject all other objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility made by the Respondent.\n\n4.97.\n\n*Costs:* Given that these arbitration proceedings will now proceed further to the merits phase, the Tribunal decides that it would be inappropriate to make any decision as to costs claimed by the Parties in their respective claims for jurisdictional relief (set out in Part III above); and that such costs should be decided in a later order or award by the Tribunal.\n\n4.98.\n\n*Jurisdictional Relief:* In these circumstances, it follows that the jurisdictional relief claimed by the Respondent is dismissed (save for its claim for costs to be deferred); and that the Claimants' claim for jurisdictional relief (save for their claims for costs to be likewise deferred) is granted to the extent decided above.\n\n***PART V: THE OPERATIVE PART***\n--------------------------------\n\n**5.1 For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal here decides as a third interim** **award;**\n\n**5.2 The Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction to proceed to the merits phase of** **these arbitration proceedings with the claims pleaded in the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, subject to the following sub** **paragraphs;**\n\n**5.3 A regards the claims pleaded by the Second Claimant (Texaco Petroleum Company or \"TexPet\") in the Claimants' said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility by its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 26 July 2010, its Reply** **Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections dated 6 October 2010 and its further submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing on 22 and 23 November 2010;**\n\n**5.4 As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or** **\"Chevron\") in the Claimants' said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in its said** **memorials and further submissions, save those relating to the jurisdictional objections raised against the First Claimant as a investor under Article I(1)(a) alleging a \"direct\" investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an \"investment** **agreement\" under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador\u2013USA Treaty of 27 August 1993 which are joined to the merits of the First Claimants' claims under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties'** **arbitration agreement under the Treaty; and**\n\n**5.5 As regards the Parties' respective claims for costs, the Tribunal here makes no** **order save to reserve in full its jurisdiction and powers to decide such claims by a later order or award in these arbitration proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Fourth Interim Award on Interim Measures", "Type": "Award (Interim)", "Date": "2013-02-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Fourth Interim Award on Interim Measures\n----------------------------------------\n\n***PART I: THE CLAIMANTS' CURRENT APPLICATION***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***(I) THE CLAIMANTS' SEVENTH REQUEST FOR INTERIM MEASURES OF 1 JUNE 2012***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 30 May 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs initiated proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, against Chevron and two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Chevron Canada Limited and Chevron Canada Finance Limited (the \"Canadian proceedings\").\n\n2.\n\nBy letter dated 1 June 2012, the Claimants requested further interim relief from the Tribunal in relation to these Canadian proceedings (the \"Claimants\u2019 Seventh Request for Interim Measures\"). This relief was sought in addition to the Orders and Interim Awards on Interim Measures made earlier in these arbitration proceedings directed at the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, which are set out below in Part Two of this Fourth Interim Award.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 20 June 2012, the Respondent requested more time to respond to the Claimants\u2019 Seventh Request for Interim Measures and, separately, \"that the Tribunal find that the Claimants are in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s Orders on Interim Measures or otherwise require that the Claimants\u2019 cease their efforts to terminate Ecuador\u2019s U.S. trade benefits on the basis of the pending arbitration\".\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 27 June 2012, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 20 June 2012.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal subsequently issued its Procedural Order No. 12 dated 29 June 2012, which provided as follows:\n\n*\"1. The Tribunal refers to the Claimants\u2019 application for revised interim measures and other matters made by letters dated 1 June 2012, the Respondent\u2019s response and application by letter dated 20 June 2012 and the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 27 June 2012.*\n\n*2. As regards the Respondent\u2019s application (page 3 of its letter dated 20 June 2012), the Tribunal grants the Respondent more time to respond substantively in writing to the Claimants\u2019 letters dated 1 and 27 June 2012; but the Tribunal requires that: (i) such response is submitted by the Respondent no later than 15 August 2012, (ii) with the Claimants\u2019 replying substantively in writing to such response no later than 14 September 2012 and (iii) the Respondent responding in writing to such reply no later than 12 October 2012.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal currently intends that the Claimant\u2019s application and the Respondent\u2019s opposition to such application shall be addressed by the Parties during the hearing currently fixed for 26 and 27 November 2012, for which additional time shall be made available.*\n\n*4. However, depending on events over this summer and autumn, it may become necessary for the Tribunal to convene a special hearing before November 2012, at short notice to the Parties.\"*\n\n6.\n\nOn 27 June 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs initiated proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil (the \"Brazilian proceedings\").\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 9 July 2012, the Tribunal requested that the Respondent add the Brazilian proceedings as a further item to be covered in its written response already ordered by the Tribunal for 15 August 2012 under paragraph 2 of its Procedural Order No 12 of 29 June 2012.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 7 August 2012, the Claimants (i) informed the Tribunal that the Lago Agrio Court had on 3 August 2012 issued a *mandamiento de ejecuci\u00f3n*, formally ordering payment of the sum of the Lago Agrio Judgment; and (ii) requested further relief from the Tribunal in relation to this alleged breach of the Tribunal\u2019s orders and awards on interim measures, joining this additional request to their Seventh Request for Interim Measures.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 15 August 2012, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 Seventh Request for Interim Measures.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 14 September 2012, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 15 August 2012.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 12 October 2012, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 14 September 2012.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 16 October 2012, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of certain orders for execution issued against Chevron and its subsidiaries by the Lago Agrio Court, as well as of certain statements made by Ecuadorian public authorities.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 7 November 2012, the Claimants, *inter alia*, informed the Tribunal of (i) certain orders issued by the Argentine courts against Chevron subsidiaries located in Argentina for the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment against those subsidiaries (the \"Argentinean proceedings\"); (ii) a decision issued by the Lago Agrio Court expanding the scope of its earlier execution orders for the Lago Agrio Judgment and granting a request for letters rogatory to be sent to corresponding foreign authorities for its enforcement, and (iii) an application made by the Government of Ecuador before the Lago Agrio Court to revoke the latter\u2019s execution order in respect of the USD 96 million *Commercial Cases Award* (but not the Lago Agrio Judgment itself).\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 21 November 2012, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 7 November 2012.\n\n***(II) THE ORAL HEARING OF 26-28 NOVEMBER 2012***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 26-28 November 2012, an oral hearing was held in London regarding the Track 1 merits issues, as well as the Claimants\u2019 Seventh Request for Interim Measures (the \"November Oral Hearing\").\n\n16.\n\nThe November Oral Hearing was attended by the Parties\u2019 legal representatives, as follows: (i) for the Claimants, Mr. Hewitt Pate (Chevron), Mr. Ricardo Reis Veiga (Chevron), Mr. Jos\u00e9 Martin (Chevron), Ms. Tanya Valli (Chevron), Professor James Crawford SC (Matrix Chambers), Mr. R. Doak Bishop (King & Spalding), Mr. Edward Kehoe (King & Spalding), Mr. Wade Coriell (King & Spalding), Mr. David Weiss (King & Spalding), Ms. Elizabeth Silbert (King & Spalding), Ms. Kristi Jacques (King & Spalding), Mr. Jorge Mattamouros (King & Spalding), Ms. Sara McBrearty (King & Spalding), Ms. Zhennia Silverman (King & Spalding) and Ms. Carol Tamez (King & Spalding), Mr. Luke A. Sobota (Jones Day), Mr. Francisco Aninat (Jones Day), Ms. Andrea Neuman (Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher), Mr. Daniel Sullivan (Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher); and (ii) for the Respondent, Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n (Attorney-General of Ecuador), Dr. Christel Gaibor (Director of International Disputes, Attorney General\u2019s Office), Dr. Cristina Viteri (Counsel, Attorney General\u2019s Office), Professor Zachary Douglas (Matrix Chambers) - in part, Mr. Luis Gonz\u00e1lez (Matrix Chambers), Mr. Eric Bloom (Winston & Strawn), Mr. Ricardo Ugarte (Winston & Strawn), Mr. Tom\u00e1s Leonard (Winston & Strawn), Ms. Nicole Silver (Winston & Strawn), Ms. Carolina Romero (Winston & Strawn) and Mr. Gregory Ewing (Winston & Strawn).\n\n17.\n\nOn the first day of the November Oral Hearing (26 November 2012), Mr. Hewitt Pate, Chevron\u2019s General Counsel, made the following statement (in English), which is appropriate to cite in full, as recorded in the English transcript:\n\n*Mr. President and Members of the Tribunal, Chevron appreciates this opportunity to appear before you again today, and Chevron looks forward to presenting its case on the merits on Phase I and to demonstrating why Texaco\u2019s completion of its remediation and social programs and the Releases it obtained in 1995 fully settled its environmental liability in Ecuador.*\n\n*That settlement should have precluded the litigation that began in 2003 as a cooperative enterprise of American [Lago Agrio] Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and the Government of Ecuador. Recall that before Chevron brought this proceeding, Ecuador used to proclaim that it would be getting 90 percent of the proceeds of that litigation.*\n\n*An equally important aspect of today\u2019s hearing concerns this Tribunal\u2019s authority to protect its own jurisdiction over the merits of this case. On February 16th of this year, the Tribunal in its Second Interim Award ordered Ecuador to take all measures necessary to prevent enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and without Ecuador. Since that time, Ecuador has not only failed to prevent enforcement, but affirmatively acted to promote enforcement actions that have now been filed against Chevron Affiliates in Canada, Argentina, and Brazil.*\n\n*With public encouragement from President Correa, Ecuador has taken numerous actions in support of enforcement. The Lago Agrio Court has acted at the bidding of the Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. It has issued multiple orders purporting to declare numerous Chevron subsidiary and affiliate companies as debtors on the Lago Agrio Judgment. Those Orders have been issued with no notice to Chevron.*\n\n*The Orders also purport to embargo Chevron assets in Argentina and Colombia.*\n\n*Ecuador\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, apostilled the power of attorney by Pablo Fajardo in favor of an Argentine law firm, when the Lago Agrio Court issued letters rogatory in support of the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a freezing order in Argentina, the Ecuadorian Transitional Judicial Council certified these letters and the Minister of Foreign Affairs apostiled them.*\n\n*Last month the Lago Agrio Court sent a letter on Republic of Ecuador letterhead to the bank holding the remaining accounts of TexPet in Ecuador ordering the bank to freeze all accounts relating to Chevron. When the Lago Agrio Court added Chevron\u2019s $96 million commercial cases arbitration Award against Ecuador to its freezing order, the Attorney General of Ecuador finally appeared. He publicly sought revocation of that order, but only as to the 96 million dollar Commercial Case Award. There was no objection to the rest of the activity taken in violation of this Tribunal\u2019s Awards.*\n\n*Enforcement actions, therefore, continue both within Ecuador and in three countries without Ecuador, and the Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers promise more enforcement cases to come. In Argentina, the Plaintiffs have now obtained an ex parte freezing order preventing Chevron Affiliates from making and receiving the payments needed to run their operations in Argentina. Chevron is addressing this matter through the courts of Argentina, but the embargo in the meantime may prove to have serious consequences not only for Chevron\u2019s Affiliates, but for their employees, and for Argentina.*\n\n*It is the Plaintiffs\u2019 stated goal to make it impossible for Chevron entities to invest further in Argentina.*\n\n*If the Plaintiffs seriously believe they possess a legitimate judgment, they would seek to enforce it in the United States where Chevron can be found. Instead, they proceed on an international campaign of disruption and threats, hoping that Chevron will give in and pay them money without regard to the merits. They could not be doing this without the active and passive support of Ecuador.*\n\n*If this Tribunal is to maintain its own authority to reach a decision on the merits or to give Chevron a meaningful opportunity to vindicate its legal rights, strong relief is needed in the format of a declaration from this Tribunal and other measures.*\n\n*As always, when I address this Tribunal, I will reiterate that Chevron has no desire for conflict with any sovereign. Texaco was a good partner to Ecuador for 20 years, generating $23 billion for Ecuador while Texaco earned $500 million, and Texaco cleaned up its share.*\n\n*Ecuador has claimed that Chevron\u2019s goal in seeking a declaration of breach from this Tribunal is to cause revocation of Ecuador\u2019s trade benefits with the United States, but Chevron gains no benefit from that result. What Chevron seeks is for Ecuador to stop its misconduct and respect this Tribunal\u2019s orders.*\n\n*To repeat myself once again, Chevron would welcome an opportunity for constructive dialogue with Ecuador and urges Ecuador to live up to its promises. In the meantime, we appreciate the opportunity to appear before this Tribunal and to combat a fraudulent and farcical judgment by invoking the rule of law. Thank you.\"*\n\n18.\n\nOn the same first day of the November Oral Hearing, Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Attorney General of Ecuador, made the following response (as interpreted from Spanish and as now recorded in the English transcript) as follows:\n\n*Mr. President, Members of the Tribunal, today we approach the end of more than seven years of litigation over Claimants\u2019 allegations of breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreements. Claimant first raised their claims in prior litigation in New York. Back then, Claimants sought both to hold the Republic liable under a Joint Operating Agreement, and to hold the Republic liable for the alleged breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement under theories of laws virtually identical to those raised here, albeit then under the labels of parens patriae.*\n\n*At the time of the New York litigation, Claimants\u2019 public relations machine condemned the Republic in public, and in political forums as a recalcitrant State that refuses to comply with its contractual obligations. But after years of litigation, both the New York courts and the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit summarily rejected Claimants\u2019 allegations of breach of the Joint Operating Agreement, finding that the Republic was not even a Party to that Agreement.*\n\n*That Judgment signaled to the Claimant that the United States Court offered no prospects of success in respect to their then remaining claims for breach of the Settlement Agreement. In fact, the presiding U.S. District Court Judge noted the fallacy in Claimants\u2019 position considering it as highly unlikely that the 1995 Settlement Agreement would have neglected to mention the Aguinda claims if it had been intended to release those claims or to create an obligation to indemnify against them.*\n\n*Claimant, obviously concerned that their breach of the settlement claim was likely facing the same fate as their other breach claims, chose to withdraw their earlier opposition to the Republic\u2019s motion to dismiss. They then allowed the case to die on jurisdictional grounds so that they could bring this identical claim to a more favorable forum.*\n\n*Claimants filed this arbitration two months later, and they simultaneously relaunched their public relations campaign against the Republic.*\n\n*Members of the Tribunal, the Parties have re-pleaded their arguments in relation to the breach-of-contract claim in this forum, and at this juncture it must be apparent to you as it was to the U.S. District Judge in New York that Claimants\u2019 breach of contractual allegations are illusory.*\n\n*The 1995 Settlement Agreement contains no covenants regarding the Ecuadorian Government\u2019s purported obligation to indemnify, protect, or defend TexPet or any other Party for that matter, against claims by third parties. Nor does it bind third parties or trigger any liability for the Republic. And while the Claimants predicate their case here on the basis of distinction between the New York litigation and Lago Agrio dispute, the Second Circuit of New York has stated that this argument is without merit. That is the final word of the Court that granted Claimant\u2019s forum non conveniens dismissal in the Aguinda case.*\n\n*Dear Members of the Tribunal, Claimants\u2019 accusations are based on non-existing contractual obligations but that has not stopped Claimants\u2019 public relations machine from attacking Ecuador as a country that refuses to abide by its contractual obligations. Nor has it stopped Claimants from waging a relentless attack against the Republic in the United States political arena, to deprive it of billions of dollars in foreign trade benefits.*\n\n*Defending against this vicious campaign is demanding an enormous diplomatic effort and is seriously affecting the Republic\u2019s interest. I respectfully ask that you follow the United States Court\u2019s lead and put an end to this abuse of the legal process at your earliest convenience.*\n\n*With your indulgence, I would like to also address a different but related issue. Claimants have sought and obtained protective measures that gave rise to various Interim Awards and now they seek a declaration of breach of these awards. It is now apparent that neither the request for the Interim Awards nor the relief sought herein is designed to protect any right in this arbitration from irreparable harm, but rather it\u2019s intended to disrupt Ecuador\u2019s bilateral relationship with the United States and inflict severe economic harm upon the Republic and its constituents. On an almost daily basis, Claimants\u2019 lobbyist firms have added the Interim Awards to the allegations of breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement to press the United States Congress and Trade Representatives to take away more than a billion dollars in trade and thousands of jobs that will affect hundreds of thousands of Ecuadorian citizens.*\n\n*Claimants now seek from this Tribunal a declaration of breach of those Interim Awards. I will not delve into legal issues relevant to the appropriateness of the relief that Claimants request, but I do want to caution this Tribunal about the gravity of a request that we regard as an unprecedented abuse of rights and the legal processes. A declaration of breach would serve no purpose other than to cause grave and irreparable economic harm to the Republic. The loss of international trade benefits would be irreversible, no matter what the outcome of these proceedings might be.*\n\n*So, an irreparable harm will have been inflicted upon the Republic on the basis of allegations that to date the Republic has not had a full opportunity to answer. But several courts in the United States have looked into Claimants\u2019 allegations; and, while Claimants can point to certain findings by Judge Kaplan, the majority of the U.S. Courts that have considered Chevron\u2019s allegations have rejected its crime fraud allegations or otherwise declined to opine on them. And while powerful economies, such as the United States or Brazil, can impose billions of dollars in fines against companies like British Petroleum and Chevron for environmental liability, a declaration that the Republic is in breach of Interim Awards at this juncture for not having interfered in environmental litigation between private parties would confirm that Chevron was not misguided when it declared that \"we cannot let small countries screw with us.\"*\n\n*Mr. President and Members of the Tribunal, Claimants should not be allowed to deliberately turn this Tribunal into an instrument of their manipulation plan. With this, I finish my intervention and with your permission, Mr. President, I will hand the floor to Zachary Douglas who will continue representing the interests of Ecuador. Many thanks.\"*\n\n19.\n\nOn the second day of the November Oral Hearing (27 November 2012), the Tribunal addressed the following invitation to the Respondent, as recorded in the English transcript:\n\n*\"[The Tribunal]:... Now, returning to the preliminary issues, we would like to address a question to the Respondent. Now, please understand we've decided none of the merits in this case, but it is possible that in the enforcement proceedings in Canada, Brazil, or Argentina, the Respondent may have a special status as to how far those proceedings are pursued whilst these [arbitration] proceedings are pending.*\n\n*It is possible that if the Claimants are right, the result of these [arbitration] proceedings would be a very significant monetary award against the Respondent in circumstances where, if execution had taken place outside Ecuador, in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, or elsewhere, the Respondent would be facing a difficulty in funding such an award without access to the proceeds of the [foreign] judgment.*\n\n*What we would like to inquire of the Respondent is whether they have considered, and if they have considered whether they are minded to do it, to intervene in these enforcement proceedings to prevent execution of those foreign judgments whilst these [arbitration] proceedings are pending. This would be not only for itself in its own interests for the reasons I've just indicated, but also because the Respondent may be facing a conflict, a conflict as a party within these proceedings subject to the Orders and Awards of this Tribunal and, of course, other obligations and duties in regard to its own citizens and the Ecuadorian Judgment being in force within and without Ecuador.\"*\n\n20.\n\nOn the last day of the November Oral Hearing (28 November 2012), the Respondent agreed to respond to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation within two weeks, as recorded in the English transcript:\n\n*\"[The Respondent]: And just to conclude, Mr. President, we, of course, received the invitation by the Tribunal yesterday, and it is important to mention that we are taking note of that invitation and to also inform the Tribunal that this has not been the first time that we have been discussing internally and at different levels the importance of the possibility that the State, the Attorney General can do--to do whatever is possible, legally possible, to comply with the Interim Awards.*\n\n*And although the invitation yesterday is extremely important, we take note of the importance that the Tribunal has indicated. We would like to, of course, take time. Of course, we cannot decide one day or another what to do with--what to respond to the Members of the Tribunal today on an issue that, of course, involves serious legal considerations; and, for that purpose, we would like to reflect on that, and we, of course, cannot take a position right now. We need to go back. And, of course, the Attorney General cannot decide by himself issues as to determine whether there is a public interest, and whether it\u2019s justified. We're considering the options, the legal consequences, and then the constitutional limits that that would imply, and for that purpose, we would like and request the Tribunal if we could have some time to come back to the Tribunal and respond to that specific invitation.*\n\n*[The Tribunal]: We will certainly address housekeeping later, but I wouldn't have thought that was a problem, subject to timing, obviously. This is a very important matter and a very important step to be very carefully considered.*\n\n*[The Respondent]: Of course, and we would take the issue immediately to the point where we\u2014thinking that we could do this in a period of two weeks.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*[The Tribunal]: Can I raise another matter that the Tribunal has discussed; it is that we are very concerned about being overtaken by events. There is no purpose in a procedure like this, which is complicated, expensive, and difficult for all concerned if at the end of the day the piece of paper that\u2019s produced by the Tribunal is completely irrelevant because events have overtaken the Tribunal. Now, we have discussed the possibility, depending on events over the next few weeks, of advancing the hearing date by six months. It\u2019s only fair to mention that to you now because there will be an enormous change in preparations for a hearing advanced by six months when we had anticipated that January/February [2014] was the earliest date that could be fairly met by the Parties. But there is no point in having a hearing in 2014 for no purpose whatsoever. So, we're not making any order at the moment, but we're just telling you that that is an option which we'll be considering in the light of the events that may take place over the next few weeks..*\n\n*On Interim Measures, obviously we will await a response from the Respondent as indicated, and I think two weeks would be an acceptable period to the Tribunal.... But we are very concerned about the Respondent\u2019s potential position in this case. Please understand we've not decided any of the merits of this case, but on one view of the case it exposes Respondent potentially to quite serious difficulties.*\n\n*I think all of us, both Parties and the Tribunal, have a common interest in ensuring that the proceedings are fair in all respects and effective, and obviously we're facing real difficulties with the possible developments of actions in other jurisdictions. And given the common interest that we have, I think the Tribunal would appreciate it if either Parties, both parties, had any thoughts as to steps which might be taken which would do something to assist the preservation of the fairness and the efficacy of the exercise of this Tribunal \u2019s jurisdiction.*\n\n*[The Respondent]: I can certainly speak to that and really reiterate what Mr. Gonzalez said earlier [for the Respondent]. That is a subject that we have discussed, and had discussed at length, and one after yesterday\u2019s invitation from the President, we renewed that discussion last night and expect to have some further extensive and serious discussions, and we will certainly advise the Tribunal within the timeframe that we agreed to.*\n\n*[The Tribunal]: Well, thank you for that observation. We welcome it wholeheartedly, and we look forward to the response when it comes in due course. And if you need a little bit longer than two weeks, please let us know because we attach very considerable importance to somehow maintaining a status quo which doesn't infringe the substantive or procedural rights of either side. But we are in unchartered waters. I don't think any of us have quite seen the situation before; and we're all, at least the Tribunal, struggling for guidance as to how to maintain this balance.\"*\n\n***(III) DEVELOPMENTS AFTER THE NOVEMBER ORAL HEARING***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 5 December 2012, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of certain developments arising since the November Oral Hearing. In regard to the Argentinean proceedings, the Claimants stated:\n\n*\"... Since Claimants\u2019 remarks on the last day of the Track 1 hearing, the Plaintiffs\u2019 Argentine embargo proceedings continue to proceed apace. On November 28, 2012, the Argentine judge issued a clarification order at the request of two of Chevron Argentina\u2019s customers (YPF and Shell), which have been ordered to withhold 40% of all amounts payable to Chevron Argentina [footnote omitted]. These customers were uncertain of the scope of the embargo and whether taxes, including, inter alia, VAT and royalties, should be excluded from the sums subject to the 40% calculation. The judge ruled that the 40% must be applied on the amounts for the purchase of hydrocarbons net of \"fiscal charges\" of any nature [footnote omitted]. As to the merits of the Argentine embargo order, the Plaintiffs are due to file their response to Chevron\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 defenses to that order today, December 5, 2012, after which time the Argentine Judge will be in a position to issue a ruling at any time on the continued application of the embargo order. In parallel to these embargo proceedings, Claimants understand that the Plaintiffs have escalated their attack against Chevron and its subsidiaries by initiating formal recognition proceedings of the Lago Agrio Judgment in Argentina....\"*\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants also reformulated their request for an urgent order or award (final or partial) to include the following relief:\n\n*\"Claimants, therefore, respectfully request that the Tribunal urgently issue a Partial Final Award, or in the alternative an Interim Award, in the terms discussed at the Track 1 hearing, including that the Tribunal:*\n\n*1. Declare that Ecuador is in breach of the First and Second Interim Awards;*\n\n*2. Declare that pending the outcome of this arbitration, the Lago Agrio Judgment is not final, enforceable, or conclusive under Ecuadorian and international law;*\n\n*3. Declare that Ecuador is responsible to Claimants for indemnification and damages for all damages, costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Claimants as a result of its breach; and*\n\n*4. Deposit the Partial Final Award without delay with the Registry of the District Court of The Hague, in accordance with Article 1058(1) of the Dutch Code of Civil Proceedings.*\n\n*In sum, Claimants request from the Tribunal the strongest possible relief, in the strongest possible form, to preserve the fairness and efficacy of this arbitration.\"*\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 6 December 2012, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 5 December 2012, stating it would report on the \"serious discussions... ongoing in response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation to find and suggest a mechanism to accomplish certain goals articulated by the Tribunal\", not later than 14 December 2012.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 7 December 2012, the Tribunal indicated as follows:\n\n*\"The Tribunal acknowledges safe receipt of the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 5 December and the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 6 December 2012.*\n\n*As there advised by the Respondent, the Tribunal intends to await the Respondent\u2019s further letter to be received by the Tribunal no later than 14 December 2012. The Tribunal also intends thereafter to provide to the Claimants a fair opportunity of responding to the Respondent\u2019s further letter.*\n\n*For the time being, until receipt of the Respondent\u2019s further letter (or further order), the Tribunal requests that no further correspondence take place in regard to the Parties\u2019 differences over interim measures.\"*\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 14 December 2012, the Respondent requested more time, until 10 January 2013, to provide its substantive response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation made during the November Oral Hearing.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 16 December 2012, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request for more time to respond to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation made at the end of the November Oral Hearing. As regards the Argentinean proceedings, the Claimants stated:\n\n*\"The Argentine court has ordered Chevron Argentina\u2019s business partners to withhold 40% of any amounts owed to Chevron Argentina and ordered banks to re-apply the 40% embargo order to the 60% of these receivables that come into Chevron Argentina\u2019s accounts. The net effect is that 64% of Chevron Argentina\u2019s receivables are being withheld [footnote omitted]. Chevron Argentina has publicly stated that the embargo affects more than 90% of its revenues for the sale of crude [footnote omitted] and that due to taxation and the need to distribute revenue among joint-venturers, the actual net effect of the embargo is even greater than 100% for some of Chevron Argentina\u2019s operations.*\n\n*An Argentine government representative has publicly stated that \"[the province of] Neuqu\u00e9n could lose some 1,200 direct jobs\" as a result of the embargo against Chevron [footnote omitted].The Secretary General of the Private Oil and Gas Union of Rio Negro and Neuqu\u00e9n has also said that the embargo \"directly affects approximately 1,700 workers, which means the same number of families, affecting at least 6,800 residents in our region, very seriously threatening the social peace\"[footnote omitted].*\n\n*The Tribunal should be aware that, as Respondent knows, the Argentine court system is in recess from December 31, 2012 to Jan. 31, 2013. Respondent\u2019s request for further delay is thus a request that this Tribunal forego any action that could be effective against enforcement actions in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s prior awards until at least February 1, 2013.*\n\n*Respondent has demonstrated repeatedly that this Tribunal can have no confidence in Respondent\u2019s compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s awards. Chevron respectfully submits that the Tribunal should therefore take actions that can be brought directly to the attention of the courts of other nations. Specifically, the Tribunal should declare that the enforcement actions violate the Interim Awards issued by the Tribunal to preserve the status quo pending a decision on the merits, and that the enforcement actions are therefore contrary to international law.\"*\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 17 December 2012, the Tribunal indicated as follows:\n\n*\"The Tribunal has considered the letter dated 14 December 2012 from the Respondent, requesting further time to 10 January 2013 for the Respondent\u2019s substantive response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation made at the end of the hearing on 28 November 2012.*\n\n*The Tribunal confirms its view as to the significance of the Respondent\u2019s substantive response. Accordingly, the Tribunal is minded to grant the extension requested by the [Respondent], subject to any new urgent circumstances arising during this extended period.*\n\n*The Tribunal acknowledges receipt of the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 16 December 2012 in response to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 14 December 2012.\"*\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2013, the Respondent provided its substantive response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation made during the November Oral Hearing. It is appropriate to cite here the substance of this response in full:\n\n*\"On November 28, 2012, counsel for the Republic represented during the Track 1 Hearing on the Merits that the Respondent and counsel were re-engaged in serious discussions aimed at resolving the Tribunal\u2019s concerns about the enforcement actions commenced by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in courts outside Ecuador. The results of the extensive deliberations are outlined below.*\n\n*At the outset, however, the Republic reiterates its concern that the Claimants have introduced the core elements of their \"fraud\" case on the merits through a series of applications for interim measures that have repeatedly required the Republic to respond to the Claimants\u2019 evolving set of allegations either spontaneously or over a period of weeks. As a result, the Tribunal has been forced to consider unprecedented requests for relief with far-reaching effects absent a full and complete record, and without affording the Republic the time it needed to critically examine the Claimants\u2019 and other available evidence. The Respondent has yet to file a substantive pleading in response to these allegations and respectfully requests that the Tribunal give careful consideration to the Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial in Track II before taking any further action.*\n\n*The interim measures \u2014 now interim awards \u2014 impose obvious and substantial legal conundrums for any public official trying to faithfully carry out his legal responsibilities. Whatever this Tribunal may currently and preliminarily conclude regarding the Lago Agrio judicial proceedings based on substantially less than a full record, the Tribunal presumably also understands that from a State official\u2019s perspective, the State\u2019s own courts have determined - albeit subject to further review at the cassation appellate level \u2014 that the Plaintiffs\u2019 lands, water, and air have been polluted, that Chevron is liable for that pollution, that over the course of many years the existing pollution has caused (and is continuing to cause) the Plaintiffs harm, and that the judgment in the underlying Ecuadorian action is intended, in part, to remedy that harm. Officials of the State, therefore, are caught between this Tribunal\u2019s Interim Awards, on the one hand, and the officials\u2019 legal duties and obligations under both domestic law and international obligations relating to equal treatment under the law that arise from international human rights conventions to which Ecuador is a party, on the other. Under the domestic legal regime, there is no conceivable basis for the Republic to interfere in private party litigation either within Ecuador or in foreign jurisdictions.*\n\n*Claimants have construed the Interim Awards as imposing on the Republic an obligation to violate its Constitution and domestic laws. The Republic has not interpreted the Interim Awards as requiring State officials to violate their own laws and considers Claimants\u2019 position utterly untenable under any conceivable principle of law or equity.*\n\n*Claimants assert that they are confronting imminent irreparable harm by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs\u2019 successive enforcement actions. In fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 enforcement actions in Canada and Brazil pose no imminent threat at all to Chevron. The Republic has previously offered declarations of Canadian and Brazilian legal experts affirming that these enforcement actions will take years to resolve [Footnote 1 omitted]. These declarations remain uncontested. Additionally, though perhaps anecdotally, news coverage of the Canadian enforcement action suggests that Plaintiffs\u2019 effort to enforce against Chevron subsidiaries will be rejected [Footnote 2 omitted].*\n\n*Plaintiffs\u2019 actions for recognition and enforcement in Argentina are no different. Those proceedings will take years to resolve and may well share the fate of the Canadian proceedings insofar as they are also targeted against Chevron subsidiaries. Argentina does, however, raise other issues.*\n\n*In Argentina, special rules deriving from a Latin American convention on the enforcement of interim measures [Footnote 3 omitted] allowed the Plaintiffs to secure the temporary attachment of certain Chevron assets \u2014 and those of Chevron\u2019s subsidiaries in Argentina \u2014 pending a final determination on the merits of the recognition and enforcement action there. The purpose of the attachment proceedings is merely to ensure that Chevron does not dissipate its assets in the jurisdiction. Even here, however, Claimants\u2019 decision to characterize the Argentine developments as threatening \"irreparable\" harm to the company is plainly strategic. To date, Chevron\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings fail to advise either its shareholders or the capital markets that have been to the contrary, instead affirming that the ongoing proceedings pose no material harm to the company.*\n\n*Moreover, under the applicable law, if Chevron fails to have the attachment order reversed on the grounds that the Argentine courts cannot reach assets of Chevron\u2019s subsidiaries, it still is entitled to post substitute collateral that would have the effect of denying the plaintiffs the right to freeze, attach or garnish income or bank accounts or otherwise affect Chevron\u2019s (or its subsidiaries') presence in Argentina. By offering substitute collateral, therefore, Chevron can eliminate any further alleged disruption to its Argentine operations for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Respondent is concerned that Chevron may eschew such a remedy based on its considered analysis that it is better to leverage any alleged disruption in Argentina to obtain even more dramatic relief here than it is to prevent the disruption in the first instance. In either event, it is clear that Chevron has the ability and wherewithal, should it choose to do so, to eliminate any disruption to its Argentine operations and thus eliminate any risk of imminent harm (irreparable or otherwise).*\n\n*Interim Measures and Interim Awards are intended to ensure that this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and its ability to grant meaningful relief are not impeded by developments on the ground. But no enforcement action brought by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs \u2014 who are not coordinating with the Republic and who do not take orders from the Republic \u2014 will lead to collections of any portion of the Lago Agrio Judgment or the seizure of assets for a number of years. Accordingly, neither of the pending actions in Canada, Brazil or Argentina will affect this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or its ability of rendering a monetary award [Footnote 4 omitted].*\n\n*The Republic, as promised, has nonetheless considered (and re-considered) options in an effort to address the Tribunal\u2019s concerns regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing efforts to enforce the judgment [Footnote 5 omitted]. The Republic considers that a combination of the following three actions should adequately address those concerns.*\n\n*First, while the Respondent has no competence under domestic law to intervene in and move the Argentine court to lift the order of attachment currently in place, it might be possible to work with the Tribunal to remove any alleged immediate threat of harm to the Argentine subsidiaries. Chevron is currently under an obligation to mitigate damages. As such, as noted above, it could post substitute collateral, which could take the form of (i) a surety insurance (\"Seguro de Cauci\u00f3n\"), (ii) a deposit in escrow in an international financial institution with operations in Argentina, (iii) a surety bond issued by an accredited financial institution with operations in Argentina, or (iv) any other form that Chevron might consider appropriate. The premise of this proposal is to find a way in which the Republic is not intervening in the private-party litigation while affording the Tribunal comfort that there is no possible imminent threat to Chevron\u2019s global operations. Should the Tribunal ultimately find against the Republic on the issue of denial of justice or breach of the BIT, the financial cost involved in structuring and implementing any of the foregoing alternatives may be computed within the quantum of any monetary award.*\n\n*Second, in the interim, the Republic would not object to the Tribunal releasing the fifty million dollar bond currently held in escrow back to the Claimants if Chevron requested those funds to apply them against any cost in which it might incur while structuring and posting substitute collateral with the courts in Argentina.*\n\n*Third, the Attorney General intends to file a letter with the National Court - specifically with the Chamber that has been recently appointed to hear Chevron\u2019s cassation appeal - to keep the National Court apprised of the existence of these arbitral proceedings and of the issues currently under consideration of the Tribunal.*\n\n*We reiterate our affirmation that much time, thought and resources have been and are still being devoted to these issues. The Republic believes that the process might be advanced if the Tribunal should convene a short hearing to discuss, informally, these proposals and perhaps others that the Tribunal might consider on its own. Should the Tribunal consider it necessary to hold such hearing prior to Respondent\u2019s filing of the Track 2 Merits Countermemorial, the Republic would respectfully request a one week extension of the February 18, 2013, deadline for such filing.\"*\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated 27 January 2013, at the request of the Tribunal (made on 23 January 2013), the Claimants replied to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 22 January 2013, rejecting its contents as both \"disappointing\" and \"wholly inadequate\". The Claimants\u2019 letter concluded:\n\n*\"Respondent\u2019s proposal for an informal hearing to discuss these matters - which is entirely unnecessary - is yet another effort to delay until real-time events overtake this arbitration, precisely what the Interim Awards were designed to prevent. Accordingly, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal (1) grant Claimants\u2019 requested relief as soon as possible [footnote omitted, referring to the Claimants\u2019 letters dated 5 and 16 December 2012] and (2) order an expedited briefing and hearing schedule for the Track 2 merits phase, as the Tribunal suggested at the close of the Track 1 hearing [footnote omitted], namely (i) Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial on the Merits on April 25, 2013, (ii) Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits on June 30, 2013, and (iii) a final Track 2 hearing on the merits in August 2013\"*\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 29 January 2012, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 27 January 2013, refuting in particular the Claimants\u2019 request for an expedited procedure.\n\n***(IV) THE PARTIES' RELIEF SOUGHT FROM THE TRIBUNAL***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nBy the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 1 June 2012 (pp. 2-3), the Claimants requested that the Tribunal issue a further interim award deciding as follows:\n\n*\"(i) declaring that Ecuador is in breach of the First and Second Interim Awards on Interim Measures;*\n\n*(ii) declaring that, on account of Ecuador\u2019s breaches of the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Awards, Ecuador is responsible for, and shall reimburse Claimants for any and all attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and other expenses incurred in defending, or preparing to defend against, recognition and enforcement actions related to the Lago Agrio Judgment; and*\n\n*(iii) cancelling the US$50 million bond requirement imposed by the Second Interim Award, returning the funds deposited by Claimants, and otherwise maintaining and reaffirming all other orders and aspects of the Second Interim Award.\"*\n\n32.\n\nBy the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 15 August 2012 (p. 6), the Respondent requested that the Tribunal decide the Claimants\u2019 Seventh Request for Interim Measures as follows:\n\n*\"For the foregoing reasons, the Republic respectfully requests that this Tribunal declare that Claimants have failed to show the requisite elements for interim relief and accordingly deny the first two requests for interim protection in their June 1, 2012 letter. Should the Tribunal find that this interim relief would be warranted under the attendant circumstances, the Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal exercise its discretion not to grant the relief requested and join resolution of this matter to the final adjudication of the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims.\"*\n\n33.\n\nDuring the Claimants\u2019 opening statement at the November Oral Hearing, the Claimants submitted a further \"Definitive Request for Relief\", seeking the following relief from the Tribunal in regard to its Seventh Request for Interim Measures:\n\n*\"I. Request for an Immediate Interim Award as a Result of Ecuador\u2019s Breaches of the First and Second Interim Awards:*\n\n*1. Declare that Ecuador is in breach of the First and Second Interim Awards;*\n\n*2. Declare that pending the outcome of this arbitration, the Lago Agrio Judgment is not final, enforceable, or conclusive under Ecuadorian and international law, and thus, is not subject to recognition and enforcement within or without Ecuador; and*\n\n*3. Declare that Ecuador is responsible to Claimants in indemnification and damages for all damages, costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Claimants as a result of its breach.\"*\n\n34.\n\nFollowing the November Oral Hearing, the Claimants sought further relief, as set out above in their letters dated 5 December 2012, 16 December 2012 and 27 January 2013; and the Respondent sought an order in regard to its application made by letter dated 22 January 2013, also as set out above.\n\n***PART II: THE TRIBUNAL'S ORDERS AND AWARDS***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***(I) THE FIRST ORDER ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 14 MAY 2010***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nOn 23 September 2009, the Claimants served a Notice of Arbitration on the Respondent pursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on 27 August 1993 (the \"Treaty\"), which provides that disputes arising under it may be submitted to an arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\").\n\n36.\n\nOn 29 September 2009, the Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n37.\n\nOn 25 February 2010, through the appointment of V.V. Veeder QC as the presiding arbitrator by the Secretary-General of the PCA, the Tribunal was constituted.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 March 2010, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting with the Parties by telephone conference-call to discuss, *inter alia*, the procedure in respect of a request for interim measures that the Claimants indicated they would soon submit to the Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nBy e-mail message dated 1 April 2010, the Claimants submitted a Request for Interim Measures (here, the \"First Request for Interim Measures\").\n\n40.\n\nBy e-mail messages dated 3 May 2010, the Respondent submitted its Response to the First Request for Interim Measures.\n\n41.\n\nBy e-mail messages dated 7 May 2010, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the First Request for Interim Measures.\n\n42.\n\nAn oral hearing on interim measures and procedural meeting was held in London on 10-11 May 2010.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal issued an Order on Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010 (the \"First Order on Interim Measures\"), the operative part of which ordered as follows:\n\n*\"1. Until further decision the Tribunal takes, pursuant to Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the following interim measures up to and including the next procedural meeting beginning on 22 November 2010:*\n\n*(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible the status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes before this Tribunal, including (in particular but without limiting howsoever the generality of the foregoing) the avoidance of any public statement tending to compromise these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*(ii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to refrain from any conduct likely to impair or otherwise adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the ability of the Tribunal to address fairly any issue raised by the Parties before this Tribunal;*\n\n*(iii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered not to exert, directly or indirectly, any unlawful influence or pressure on the Court addressing the pending litigation in Ecuador known as the Lago Agrio Case;*\n\n*(iv) The Claimants and the Respondent are ordered to inform the Tribunal (in writing) of the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio Case as soon as such date becomes known to any of them;*\n\n*(v) The Respondent is ordered to communicate (in writing and also by any other appropriate means) the Tribunal\u2019s invitation to the Court in the Lago Agrio Case to make known as a professional courtesy to the Tribunal the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio Case; and, to that end, the Respondent is ordered to send to the Court the full text in Spanish and English of the Tribunal\u2019s present order; and*\n\n*(vi) The Respondent is ordered to facilitate and not to discourage, by every appropriate means, the Claimants\u2019 engagement of legal experts, advisers and representatives from the Ecuadorian legal profession for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings (at the Claimants\u2019 own expense).*\n\n*2. This Order is and shall remain subject to modification in the light of any future event, upon the Tribunal\u2019s own motion or upon any Party\u2019s application, particularly in the light of any new development in the Lago Agrio Case and the issue of the Court\u2019s judgement in such Case; and any of the Parties may apply to the Tribunal for such modification upon 24 hours\u2019 written notice.*\n\n*3. This Order is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties\u2019 procedural and substantive disputes, including the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional and admissibility objections and the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\"*\n\n***(II) THE SECOND ORDER ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 6 DECEMBER 2010***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nBy letter dated 26 May 2010, the Claimants complained that the Respondent had breached the First Order on Interim Measures.\n\n45.\n\nBy letter dated 3 June 2010, the Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 letter of 26 May 2010, rejecting their complaint and raising its own complaint against the Claimants.\n\n46.\n\nOn 14 June 2010, after considering the letters from the Parties, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 4, *inter alia*, deciding that no breach of its order had been established against any Party.\n\n47.\n\nBy letter dated 27 October 2010, the Claimants presented an additional request for interim measures (here, the \"Second Request for Interim Measures\").\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated 12 November 2010, the Respondent responded to the Second Request for Interim Measures.\n\n49.\n\nA Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility was held in London on 22-23 November 2010. It included further oral submissions by the Parties on the Claimants\u2019 Second Request for Interim Measures.\n\n50.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Respondent confirmed that it had no objection to the continuation of paragraphs 1(i), 1(ii), 1(iii), 1(iv) and 1(vi) of the Tribunal\u2019s First Order on Interim Measures.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its further Order on Interim Measures dated 6 December 2010 (the \"Second Order on Interim Measures\"), the operative part of which ordered as follows:\n\n*\"1. Until further decision the Tribunal takes, pursuant to Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the following interim measures up to and including the date of issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction:*\n\n*(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible the status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes before this Tribunal, including (in particular but without limiting howsoever the generality of the foregoing) the avoidance of any public statement tending to compromise these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*(ii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to refrain from any conduct likely to impair or otherwise adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the ability of the Tribunal to address fairly any issue raised by the Parties before this Tribunal;*\n\n*(iii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered not to exert, directly or indirectly, any unlawful influence or pressure on the Court addressing the pending litigation in Ecuador known as the Lago Agrio Case;*\n\n*(iv) The Claimants and the Respondent are ordered to inform the Tribunal (in writing) of the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio Case as soon as such date becomes known to any of them;*\n\n*(v) The Tribunal has decided, of its own motion, to write a letter to the Court in the Lago Agrio Case (in the form of the draft attached) inviting that Court to make known as a professional courtesy to the Tribunal the likely date for the issue of its judgment in that Case; and*\n\n*(vi) The Respondent is ordered to facilitate and not to discourage, by every appropriate means, the Claimants\u2019 engagement of legal experts, advisers and representatives from the Ecuadorian legal profession for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings (at the Claimants\u2019 own expense).*\n\n*2.

This Order is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties\u2019 procedural and substantive disputes, including the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional and admissibility objections and the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\"*\n\n***(III) THE THIRD ORDER ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 28 JANUARY 2011***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nBy letter dated 14 January 2011, the Claimants submitted a revised application for interim measures (here, the \"Third Request for Interim Measures\" and also \"the Claimants\u2019 Second Application\").\n\n53.\n\nOn 26 January 2011, the Tribunal heard the Parties\u2019 legal representatives at a procedural meeting (held by telephone conference-call) as regards the procedure required to address the Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Interim Measures and the Respondent\u2019s opposition to the Third Request for Interim Measures.\n\n54.\n\nDuring the procedural meeting, the Claimants indicated that the Tribunal should determine their Third Request for Interim Measures urgently without any oral hearing (i.e., on the Parties\u2019 written submissions and other materials already submitted); the Respondent opposed such procedure and requested an oral hearing preceded by an opportunity to make written submissions opposing the Third Request for Interim Measures; and the Claimants indicated that if their application could not be determined by the Tribunal timeously, the Claimants requested an immediate \"temporary order\" in like terms pending such determination.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Procedural Order and Further Order on Interim Measures dated 28 January 2011 (the \"Third Order on Interim Measures\"), the operative part of which decided as follows:\n\n*\"(A) The Respondent shall submit its written submissions in response to the Claimants\u2019 [Third Request for Interim Measures] as soon as practicable but no later than 1700 hours (Netherlands time) on Friday, 4 February 2011 (or such other date as may be ordered by the Tribunal);*\n\n*(B) There shall be an oral hearing on the Claimants\u2019 [Third Request for Interim Measures] and the Respondent\u2019s opposition thereto at the Peace Palace, The Hague, provisionally on Sunday, 6 February 2011 (or such other date as may be ordered by the Tribunal) at a time and in a form to be decided later by the Tribunal;*\n\n*(C) Pending such oral hearing or further order (on application by any Party or by the Tribunal upon its own initiative), the Tribunal takes the following interim measures pursuant to Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:*\n\n*1. The Tribunal re-confirms Paragraphs 1(i) to (iv) of its Order dated 14 May 2010 (as amended); namely:*\n\n*(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible the status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes before this Tribunal, including (in particular but without limiting howsoever the generality of the foregoing) the avoidance of any public statement tending to compromise these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*(ii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to refrain from any conduct likely to impair or otherwise adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the ability of the Tribunal to address fairly any issue raised by the Parties before this Tribunal;*\n\n*(iii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered not to exert, directly or indirectly, any unlawful influence or pressure on the Court addressing the pending litigation in Ecuador known as the Lago Agrio Case;*\n\n*(iv) The Claimants and the Respondent are ordered to inform the Tribunal (in writing) of the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio Case as soon as such date becomes known to any of them;*\n\n*(v) The Tribunal has decided, of its own motion, to write a letter to the Court in the Lago Agrio Case (in the form of the draft attached) inviting that Court to make known as a professional courtesy to the Tribunal the likely date for the issue of its judgment in that Case; and*\n\n*(vi) The Respondent is ordered to facilitate and not to discourage, by every appropriate means, the Claimants\u2019 engagement of legal experts, advisers and representatives from the Ecuadorian legal profession for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings (at the Claimants\u2019 own expense).*\n\n*2. Whilst the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not named parties to these arbitration proceedings and the Respondent is not a named party to the Lago Agrio Case, the Tribunal records that, as a matter of international law, a State may be responsible for the conduct of its organs, including its judicial organs, as expressed in Chapter II of Part One of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility;*\n\n*3. If it were established that any judgment made by an Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio Case was a breach of an obligation by the Respondent owed to the Claimants as a matter of international law, the Tribunal records that any loss arising from the enforcement of such judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses for which the Respondent would be responsible to the Claimants under international law, as expressed in Part Two of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility; and*\n\n*4. This order for further interim measures is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice to any Party\u2019s case as regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimants\u2019 [Third Request for Interim Measures and other applications of 14 January 2011], the Respondent\u2019s opposition to [the Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Interim Measures and other applications of 14 January 2011] and any claim or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute.\"*\n\n***(IV) THE FOURTH ORDER ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 9 FEBRUARY 2011***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated 1 February 2011, the Respondent declared its intention not to make written submissions on the Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Interim Measures, in accordance with Paragraph A of the Tribunal\u2019s Third Order on Interim Measures.\n\n57.\n\nOn 6 February 2011, an oral hearing was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague at which the Parties made oral submissions to the Tribunal on the Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Interim Measures.\n\n58.\n\nOn 6 February 2011, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal continued, until further order, Paragraph C of its Third Order on Interim Measures.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its further Order on Interim Measures dated 9 February 2011 (the \"Fourth Order on Interim Measures\"), the operative part of which decided as follows:\n\n*\"(A) As to jurisdiction, the Tribunal records that it has not yet determined the Respondent\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction (as recorded in the fourth preamble to its Order of 28 January 2011). Nonetheless, for the limited purpose of the present decision, the Tribunal provisionally assumes that it has jurisdiction to decide upon the Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Interim Measures on the ground that the Claimants have established, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal, a sufficient case for the existence of such jurisdiction at this preliminary stage of these arbitration proceedings under the written arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants against the Respondent under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"BIT\"), incorporating by reference the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\");*\n\n*(B) The Tribunal notes that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal, at the request of a party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or award) in respect of the subject-matter of the parties\u2019 dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of a final, partial or interim award; (iii) Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award is final and binding on the parties, with the parties undertaking to carry out such award without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the BIT provides (inter alia) that an award rendered pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the BIT under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be binding on the parties to the dispute, with the Contracting Parties undertaking to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement;*\n\n*(C) As to form, the Tribunal records that, whilst this decision under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules is made in the form of an order and not an interim award, given the urgency required for such decision, the Tribunal may decide (upon its own initiative or any Party\u2019s request) to confirm such order at a later date in the form of an interim award under Articles 26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules, without the Tribunal hereby intending conclusively to determine the status of this decision, one way or the other, as an award under the 1958 New York Convention.*\n\n*(D) As to the grounds for the Claimants\u2019 Second Application, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have made out a sufficient case, to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction, under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, for the order made below in the discretionary exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to take interim measures in respect of the subject-matter of the Parties\u2019 dispute;*\n\n*(E) Bearing in mind the Respondent\u2019s several obligations under the BIT and international law, including the Respondent\u2019s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award on the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to make such an award), the Tribunal orders:*\n\n*(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and*\n\n*(ii) the Respondent\u2019s Government to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent\u2019s legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of this order for interim measures; pending further order or award in these arbitration proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s award on jurisdiction or (assuming jurisdiction) on the merits;*\n\n*(F) The Tribunal records that it is common ground between the Claimants and the Respondent in these arbitration proceedings, as also re-confirmed by the Respondent at the oral hearing on 6 February 2011 (page 107 of the English transcript and page 101 of the Spanish transcript) that, under Ecuadorian law, a judgment entered in a domestic proceeding at first instance (such as a first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case) is not final, conclusive or enforceable during the pendency of a first-level appeal until at least such time as that appeal has been decided by the first-level appellate court;*\n\n*(G) The Tribunal continues Paragraph C (1) to (3) of its order of 28 January 2011 (which order is incorporated by reference herein);*\n\n*(H) The Tribunal decides further that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly and severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in performing its obligations under this order, as may be decided by the Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction);*\n\n*(I) This order shall be immediately final and binding upon all Parties, subject only to any subsequent variation made by the Tribunal (upon either its own initiative or any Party\u2019s request); and*\n\n*(J) This order, as with the earlier order of 26 January 2011, is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice to any Party\u2019s case as regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimants\u2019 First Application made by letter dated 12 December 2010, the Respondent\u2019s opposition to such First Application, and to any claim or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute.\"*\n\n***(V) THE FIFTH ORDER ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 16 MARCH 2011***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, a judgment was issued against the First Claimant in *Maria Aguinda et al. v. Chevron Texaco Corporation*, Proceeding No. 002-2003 before the Provincial Court of Sucumb\u00edos in Lago Agrio, Ecuador (the \"Lago Agrio Judgment\").\n\n61.\n\nBy letter dated 23 February 2011, the Claimants renewed and extended their request for interim measures regarding the criminal proceedings pending in Ecuador against Chevron attorneys Messrs. Ricardo Veiga and Rodrigo P\u00e9rez (the \"Fourth Request for Interim Measures\").\n\n62.\n\nBy letter dated 24 February 2011, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the measures that it had taken to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Fourth Order for Interim Measures and requested the immediate revocation of that order.\n\n63.\n\nBy letter dated 28 February 2011, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal find that the Claimants had violated the Tribunal\u2019s prior Orders for Interim Measures or issue new interim measures to specifically prohibit the Claimants\u2019 alleged breaches.\n\n64.\n\nBy letter dated 4 March 2011, the Claimants alleged that the Respondent had violated the Tribunal\u2019s Fourth Order for Interim Measures and request relief in relation thereto (here, the \"Fifth Request for Interim Measures\").\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 7 dated 16 March 2011 (the \"Fifth Order on Interim Measures\"), which decided as follows:\n\n*\"1. The Tribunal here addresses the four disputed applications in these arbitration proceedings regarding the Tribunal\u2019s several orders for interim measures dated 14 May 2010, 28 January 2011 and 9 February 2011; namely: (i) the first application by the Claimants made by letter dated 23 February 2011; (ii) the second application by the Respondent made by letter dated 24 February 2011; (iii) the third application by the Respondent made by letter dated 28 February 2011; and (iv) the fourth application by the Claimants made by letter dated 4 March 2011.*\n\n*2. First Application: As regards the first application by the Claimants for further interim measures against the Respondent in regard to the criminal proceedings in Ecuador concerning (inter alios) two of the Claimants\u2019 legal representatives (Messrs Ricardo Veiga and Rodrigo P\u00e9rez), the Tribunal refers to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 23 February 2011, the Claimants\u2019 email message dated 25 February 2011 and the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 10 March 2011.*\n\n*3. Having considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions listed in paragraph 2 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants\u2019 application pleaded specifically at page 21 of their letter dated 23 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal\u2019s existing orders for interim measures.*\n\n*4. Second Application: As regards the second application made by the Respondent seeking the revocation of the Tribunal\u2019s order dated 9 February 2011, the Tribunal refers to Part II of the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 24 February 2011 and the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 4 March 2011.*\n\n*5. Having considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions listed in paragraph 4 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent\u2019s application or the Claimants\u2019 counter-application, beyond maintaining its existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.*\n\n*6. Third Application: As regards the third application made by the Respondent in regard to alleged violations by the Claimants of the Tribunal\u2019s orders for interim measures and for further interim measures, the Tribunal refers to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 28 February 2001 and the Claimants\u2019 letters dated 4 and 10 March 2001.*\n\n*7. Having considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions listed in paragraph 6 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent\u2019s application pleaded specifically at page 3 of its letter dated 28 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal\u2019s existing orders for interim measures.*\n\n*8. Fourth Application: As regards the fourth application made by the Claimants in regard to alleged violations by the Respondent of the Tribunal\u2019s order dated 9 February 2011, the Tribunal refers to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 4 March 2011.*\n\n*9. Having considered the written submissions listed in paragraph 8 above (with attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants\u2019 application, beyond maintaining the Tribunal\u2019s existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.*\n\n*10. This procedural order shall not prejudice any issue as regards jurisdiction, admissibility or merits in these proceedings; nor shall it preclude any future application by any Party for interim measures or like relief in the event of any change in relevant circumstances.\"*\n\n***(VI) THE FIRST INTERIM AWARD ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 25 JANUARY 2012***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nOn 4 January 2012, the appellate division of the Provincial Court of Sucumb\u00edos in Lago Agrio, Ecuador affirmed the first-instance judgment of the court in *Maria Aguinda et al. v. Chevron Texaco Corporation*, Proceeding No. 002-2003.\n\n67.\n\nBy letter dated 4 January 2012, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal immediately \"(i) convert the order dated February 9, 2011 (the 'Interim Measures Order') into the form of an Interim Award, as the Tribunal contemplated in the Order; and (ii) request that the Republic of Ecuador inform the Tribunal, by this Friday, 6 January, 2012, of the steps that it intends to take to comply with the Interim Measures Order and prevent the Lago Agrio Judgment from becoming enforceable\" (here, the \"Sixth Request for Interim Measures\").\n\n68.\n\nBy letter dated 9 January 2012, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 Sixth Request for Interim Measures and requested that the Tribunal vacate its Fourth Order on Interim Measures.\n\n69.\n\nBy letter dated 12 January 2012, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 9 January 2012 and again requested that the Tribunal immediately issue an award on interim measures.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter dated 13 January 2012, the Respondent replied to the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 12 January 2012, disputing (inter alia) the Claimants\u2019 application and indicating that it would make a further reply \"on or before 24 January 2012\".\n\n71.\n\nBy letter dated 24 January 2012, as earlier indicated, the Respondent replied further to the Claimants\u2019 said letter dated 12 January 2012.\n\n72.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting by telephone conference-call with the Parties\u2019 legal representatives regarding procedural arrangements for an oral hearing to be held on 11-12 February 2012 in regard to the Parties\u2019 respective applications regarding interim measures.\n\n73.\n\nPending such oral hearing, the Tribunal issued its First Interim Award on Interim Measures dated 25 January 2012 (the \"First Interim Award on Interim Measures\"), the operative part of which decided as follows:\n\n*\"1. Pursuant to Paragraph (C) of its Order dated 9 February 2011 and upon the following terms, the Tribunal confirms and re-issues such Order as an Interim Award pursuant to Articles 26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, specifically Paragraph (E) of such Order; namely (as here modified):*\n\n*2. Bearing in mind the Respondent\u2019s several obligations under the BIT and international law, including the Respondent\u2019s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award on the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to make such an award), the Tribunal orders:*\n\n*(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and*\n\n*(ii) the Respondent\u2019s Government shall continue to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent\u2019s legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of this Interim Award;*\n\n*pending the February Hearing\u2019s completion and any further order or award in these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*3. This Interim Award is and shall remain subject to modification (including its extension or termination) by the Tribunal at or after the February Hearing; and, in the meantime, any of the Parties may also apply to the Tribunal for such modification upon 72 hours\u2019 written notice for good cause shown;*\n\n*4. This Interim Award is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties\u2019 substantive and other procedural disputes, including (but not limited to) the Parties\u2019 respective applications to be heard at the February Hearing;*\n\n*5. This Interim Award shall take effect forthwith as an Interim Award, being immediately final and binding upon all Parties as an award subject only to any subsequent modification as herein provided, whether upon the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative or any Party\u2019s application; and*\n\n*6. This Interim Award, although separately signed by the Tribunal\u2019s members on three signing pages constitutes an \"interim award\" signed by the arbitrators under Article 32of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\"*\n\n***(VII) THE SECOND INTERIM AWARD ON INTERIM MEASURES OF 16 FEBRUARY 2012***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nOn 11 February 2012, an oral hearing was held in Washington DC to hear the Parties\u2019 respective applications regarding interim measures.\n\n75.\n\nFollowing that hearing, the Tribunal issued its Second Interim Award on Interim Measures dated 16 February 2012 (the \"Second Interim Award on Interim Measures\"), the operative part of which decided as follows:\n\n*1. The Tribunal determines that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules (forming part of the arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants under the Treaty) permits this Tribunal, at the request of a Party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or award) in respect of the subject-matter of the Parties\u2019 dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules permits this Tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of an interim award; (iii) Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award by this Tribunal is final and binding on the Parties, with the Parties undertaking to carry out such award without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the Treaty provides (inter alia) that an award rendered by this Tribunal pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the Treaty under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be binding on the parties to the dispute (i.e. the Claimants and the Respondent), with the Contracting Parties (i.e. here the Respondent) undertaking to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement;*\n\n*2. The Tribunal determines further that the Claimants have established, for the purpose of their said applications for interim measures, (i) a sufficient case as regards both this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute and the Claimants\u2019 case on the merits against the Respondent; (ii) a sufficient urgency given the risk that substantial harm may befall the Claimants before this Tribunal can decide the Parties\u2019 dispute by any final award; and (iii) a sufficient likelihood that such harm to the Claimants may be irreparable in the form of monetary compensation payable by the Respondent in the event that the Claimants\u2019 case on jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits should prevail before this Tribunal;*\n\n*3. Bearing in mind the Respondent\u2019s several obligations under the Treaty and international law, including the Respondent\u2019s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award on the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute in these arbitration proceedings and the Tribunal\u2019s mission (required under the arbitration agreement) efficaciously and fairly to decide the Parties\u2019 dispute by a final award, the Tribunal hereby orders:*\n\n*(i) the Respondent (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgments by the Provincial Court of Sucumb\u00edos, Sole Division (Corte Provincial de Justicia de Sucumb\u00edos, Sala Unica de la Corte Provincial de Justicia de Sucumb\u00edos) of 3 January 2012 and of 13 January 2012 (and, to the extent confirmed by the said judgments, of the judgment by Judge Nicol\u00e1s Zambrano Lozada of 14 February 2011) against the First Claimant in the Ecuadorian legal proceedings known as \"the Lago Agrio Case\";*\n\n*(ii) in particular, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such measures to preclude any certification by the Respondent that would cause the said judgments to be enforceable against the First Claimant; and*\n\n*(iii) the Respondent\u2019s Government to continue to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent\u2019s legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of its legal obligations under this Second Interim Award;*\n\n*until any further order or award made by the Tribunal in these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*4. The Tribunal determines that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly and severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in performing its legal obligations under this Second Interim Award, as may be decided by the Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction); and further that, as security for such contingent responsibility the Claimants shall deposit within thirty days of the date of this Second Interim Award the amount of US$ 50,000,000.00 (United States Dollars Fifty Million) with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a manner to be designated separately, to the order of this Tribunal;*\n\n*5. The Tribunal dismisses the application made by the Respondent to vacate its order for interim measures of 9 February 2011;*\n\n*6. The Tribunal\u2019s existing orders for interim measures (as recited in the First Interim Award) and the First Interim Award shall continue to have effect subject to the terms of this Second Interim Award;*\n\n*7. This Second Interim Award is and shall remain subject to modification at any time before the Tribunal\u2019s final award in these arbitration proceedings; and, in the meantime, any of the Parties may also apply to the Tribunal for such modification upon seventy-two hours\u2019 written notice for good cause shown, including any material change in the legal or factual circumstances prevailing as at the date of the Hearing;*\n\n*8. This Second Interim Award is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties\u2019 substantive and other procedural disputes, including the Respondent\u2019s objections as to jurisdiction, admissibility and merits;*\n\n*9. This Second Interim Award shall take effect forthwith as an Interim Award, being immediately final and binding upon all Parties as an award subject only to any subsequent modification as herein provided, whether upon the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative or any Party\u2019s application; and*\n\n*10. This Interim Award, although separately signed by the Tribunal\u2019s members on three signing pages constitutes an \"interim award\" signed by the three arbitrators under Article 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.*\n\n***(VIII) THE THIRD INTERIM AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OF 27 FEBRUARY 2012***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Third Interim Award on Interim Measures dated 16 February 2012 (the \"Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\"), the operative part of which decided as follows:\n\n*\"5.1 For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal here decides as a third interim award:*\n\n*5.2 The Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction to proceed to the merits phase of these arbitration proceedings with the claims pleaded in the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, subject to the following sub-paragraphs;*\n\n*5.3 As regards the claims pleaded by the Second Claimant (Texaco Petroleum Company or \"TexPet\") in the Claimants\u2019 said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility by its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 26 July 2010, its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections dated 6 October 2010 and its further submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing on 22 and 23 November 2010;*\n\n*5.4 As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or \"Chevron\") in the Claimants\u2019 said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in its said memorials and further submissions, save those relating to the jurisdictional objections raised against the First Claimant as a investor under Article I(1)(a) alleging a \"direct\" investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an \"investment agreement\" under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty of 27 August 1993 which are joined to the merits of the First Claimants\u2019 claims under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties\u2019 arbitration agreement under the Treaty; and*\n\n*5.5 As regards the Parties\u2019 respective claims for costs, the Tribunal here makes no order save to reserve in full its jurisdiction and powers to decide such claims by a later order or award in these arbitration proceedings.\"*\n\n***PART III: THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS***\n--------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms and restates with full force and effect its earlier orders and awards on interim measures. Each of these orders and awards was and remains binding upon the Parties under the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules and international law. Under Article VI of the Treaty and Article 32(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Parties undertook to carry out any award without delay, including the First and Second Interim Awards on Interim Measures of 25 January and 16 February 2012.\n\n78.\n\nAs regards the Respondent, these orders and awards were directed not only to the Respondent\u2019s executive branch but to all branches and organs that make up the Respondent as a State, including its judiciary and legislature. Neither disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s orders and awards on interim measures nor constraints under Ecuadorian law can excuse the failure of the Respondent, through any of its branches or organs, to fulfil its obligations under international law imposed by the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules and the Tribunal\u2019s orders and awards thereunder, particularly the First and Second Interim Awards on Interim Measures.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal determines that the Lago Agrio Judgment was made final, enforceable and subject to execution within Ecuador by the Respondent no later than 3 August 2012 (upon its judiciary\u2019s certifying the Lago Agrio Judgment\u2019s enforceability), in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s First and Second Interim Awards requiring the Respondent, respectively, \"to take all measures at its disposal\" and \"to take all measures necessary\" to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition both within and without Ecuador of that Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n80.\n\nThereafter, the status accorded by the Respondent to the Lago Agrio Judgment led directly to what the Tribunal was seeking expressly to preclude temporarily by its orders and awards on interim measures, namely the attempted enforcement and execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment against the First Claimant (with its subsidiary companies) by persons acting in the name of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs not only within but also outside Ecuador, currently in the state courts of Canada, Brazil and Argentina and possibly in the near future also in the state courts of other countries.\n\n81.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal requires the Respondent to show cause to this Tribunal why the Respondent should not now compensate the First Claimant for any harm caused by the Respondent\u2019s violations of the First and Second Interim Awards in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment\u2019s enforcement and execution, both within and outside Ecuador. The Tribunal intends presently to establish a further procedural timetable to address such compensation (including any issues as to causation and quantification) in consultation with the Parties, by a further procedural order.\n\n82.\n\nMoreover, from its perspective under international law, this Tribunal is the only tribunal with the power to restrain the Respondent generally from aggravating the Parties\u2019 dispute and causing irreparable harm to the Claimants in regard to the enforcement and execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Such restraint has not been achieved by any state court (including courts in the USA); nor could it be in the circumstances of this most unusual case. The Tribunal therefore confirms and declares, as a matter of international law, that the Respondent has a continuing obligation to ensure that the commitments that it has given under the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules are not rendered nugatory by the finalisation, enforcement or execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment in violation of the First and Second Interim Awards.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal bears much in mind that the amounts at stake are potentially huge in these arbitration proceedings, measured in multiple billions of US dollars. For the Claimants, that means that an award of damages expressed in tens of billions of US dollars could provide no adequate remedy, if their full case were to prevail against the Respondent and if the Lago Agrio Judgment were in the meantime enforced and executed. Conversely for the Respondent, on these same assumptions, that means an award of damages could nonetheless be recovered by the Claimants, albeit not in tens of billions, but in many millions or even billions of US dollars.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes note that the first part (probably a substantial part) of any recoveries on execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment outside Ecuador appears unlikely to be paid to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs in Ecuador, but rather to foreign funding and other financial institutions associated with persons acting in their name, based in countries other than Ecuador.\n\n85.\n\nIt is therefore difficult now to exaggerate the risks facing the First Claimant and thus, indirectly, the Respondent also from the enforcement and execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, based on the materials filed by both sides in this arbitration, there are increasingly grave risks that enforcement and execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment against the First Claimant (with its subsidiary companies) will imperil to a very significant extent the overall fairness and the efficacy of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n86.\n\nIn accordance with the existing timetable requested by the Respondent, the Tribunal has yet to decide any of the substantive merits of this dispute; and nothing in any order or award (including this award) should be read as pre-judging any of those merits.\n\n***PART IV: THE OPERATIVE PART***\n---------------------------------\n\n***Accordingly, the Tribunal now makes this Fourth Interim Award as follows:***\n\n***1) The Tribunal declares that the Respondent has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalisation and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina;***\n\n***2) The Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall show cause, in accordance with a procedural timetable to be ordered by the Tribunal separately, why it (the Respondent) should not compensate the First Claimant for any harm caused by the Respondent\u2019s violations of the First and Second Interim Awards;***\n\n***3) The Tribunal declares and confirms that the Respondent was and remains legally obliged under international law to ensure that the Respondent\u2019s commitments under the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules are not rendered nugatory by the finalisation, enforcement or execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment in violation of the First and Second Interim Awards; and***\n\n***4) The Tribunal states expressly that: (i) it has not yet decided any of the substantive merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute; and (ii) this award is made strictly without prejudice to those merits, including all claims advanced by the Claimants and all defences advanced by the Respondent.***"}, {"Title": "First Partial Award on Track I", "Type": "Award (Partial)", "Date": "2013-09-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "First Partial Award on Track I\n------------------------------\n\n***PART A: THE ARBITRATION \u2013 TRACK I***\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\n*Introduction:* This Partial Award addresses the Parties' dispute concerning the legal interpretation and legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement made between the Second Claimant (\"TexPet\") and the Respondent as its signatory parties, to which the First Claimant (\"Chevron\") was not a signatory Party. For ease of reference, a full copy of the 1995 Settlement Agreement in its original Spanish version is appended to and forms part of this Partial Award (Appendix 1). Given the original language of this Partial Award, for convenience only, references are made below to its English translation, save where otherwise indicated.\n\n2.\n\nGiven the status of this Partial Award as the fifth award made in these arbitration proceedings, it serves no purpose here re-stating the formal parts set out in the Tribunal's earlier awards; and for simplicity's sake, the Tribunal here incorporates by reference Part I of its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 21 February 2012.\n\n3.\n\n*Procedure* : In summary, applying a \u2018prima facie' standard appropriate to issues of jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided in that Third Interim Award that the Claimants' interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, albeit strongly disputed by the Respondent, was at least \"serious\"; but the Tribunal did not otherwise there finally decide on the interpretation or effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement one way or the other. Instead the Tribunal decided, given that both were mixed questions relevant to the Respondent's disputed jurisdictional objections under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT and to the merits of Chevron's disputed claims, to join the Respondent's jurisdictional objection to the merits of those claims under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n4.\n\nSubsequently, by its Procedural Order No 10 dated 9 April 2012, the Tribunal divided the merits of the Parties' dispute into two parts, entitled \"Track I\" and \"Track II\". Track I was to comprise preliminary legal issues arising from the 1995 Settlement Agreement, limited to its legal interpretation and legal effect as alleged by the Claimants and disputed by the Respondent, including (in particular) whether or not Chevron is a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release: Paragraphs 2 & 3 of the Procedural Order.\n\n5.\n\nGiven the complexities of the Parties' overall dispute and its developing nature as this arbitration continues, the Tribunal also recognised in Procedural Order No 10 that it might not be possible or appropriate to decide these preliminary issues in full, thereby requiring the Tribunal to defer one or more decisions to Track II. Even in that event, however, the Tribunal recognised that time and expense would not necessarily be duplicated or wasted for the Parties or the Tribunal. As explained below, the Tribunal has decided that it is not appropriate in Track I to decide in full the legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, applying the legal interpretation here decided by the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\n*Written Pleadings:* Pursuant to the Tribunal's procedural orders, the Parties submitted the following written pleadings relevant to Track I (the first two pre-dating Procedural Order No 10):\n\n(i) The Claimants' Memorial on the Merits dated 6 September 2010;\n\n(ii) The Claimants' Supplemental Memorial on the Merits dated 20 March 2012;\n\n(iii) The Respondent's Counter-Memorial dated 3 July 2012;\n\n(iv) The Claimants' Reply Memorial dated 29 August 2012; and\n\n(v) The Respondent's Rejoinder dated 26 October 2012.\n\nWhilst the Parties have submitted during these proceedings other written pleadings touching upon issues decided in this Partial Award, the Tribunal considers that their respective written cases for Track I can fairly be taken for present purposes from the five pleadings listed above.\n\n7.\n\n*Written Testimony* : The Claimants submitted the following written expert testimony relevant to Track I:\n\n(i) The first expert report of Dr Enrique Barros (undated);\n\n(ii) The first and second expert reports of Dr C\u00e9sar Coronel Jones dated 3 September 2010;\n\n(iii) The first expert report of Professor \u00c1ngel R.

Oquendo and Dr Gustavo Romero Ponce; and\n\n(iii) The joint expert report dated 7 August 2012 of Professor Gilles Le Chatelier and Professor \u00c1ngel R. Oquendo.\n\n12.\n\n*The November Hearing:* The issues under Track I were argued by the Parties at the oral hearing in London held over three days from 26 to 28 November 2013, with the assistance of English and Spanish interpreters and recorded in the form of both English and Spanish transcripts (the \"November Hearing\"). The references below are made to the English version of the November Hearing's verbatim transcript, as follows: D1.10 signifies the first day, at page 10.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent were represented respectively at the November Hearing by those persons listed in the verbatim transcript; and it serves no purpose here listing these persons by name, save as follows: for the Claimants, opening oral submissions were made Mr Hewitt Pate [D1.8], Professor Crawford [D1.12] and Doak Bishop Esq [D1.33]; for the Respondent opening oral submissions were made by Attorney-General Garc\u00eda Carr\u00edon [D1.60] and Professor Douglas [D1.64]; for the Claimants, closing oral submissions were made by Mr Hewitt Pate [D3,471], Professor Crawford [D3,491 & D3,545] and Doak Bishop Esq [D3,522]; and for the Respondent, closing oral submissions were made by Luis Gonz\u00e1les Esq [D3,555], Tom\u00e1s Leonard Esq [D3,573] and Eric W. Bloom Esq [D3,594].\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants tendered three oral witnesses at the November Hearing: (i) Dr Ricardo Reis Vega [D2,244x, 247xx & 283xxx]; (ii) Professor \u00c1ngel P. Oquendo [D2,298x, 299xx & 376xxx]; and (iii) Dr Gustavo Romero Ponce [D2,381 & 383xx]. The Respondent tendered two oral witnesses at the November Hearing: (i) Mr Giovanni Elicio Mario Rosania Schiavone [D1.96x, 104xx & 147 xxx]; and (ii) Professor Genaro Eguiguren [D1,155x, 173xx & 219xxx].\n\n15.\n\n*Track II:* At as the date of this Partial Award, the Parties are completing their written pleadings in Track II, to be achieved by 29 November 2013, with the oral hearing in Track II fixed to start on 13 January 2014.\n\n***PART B: THE PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS***\n-------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\n*Introduction:* It is necessary at the outset to describe briefly the three principal sets of contractual documentation to which further reference is made below: (i) the 1995 Settlement Agreement, (ii) the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases; and (iii) the 1998 Final Release.\n\n17.\n\n*(i) The 1995 Settlement Agreement:* On 4 May 1995, the Respondent acting by its Ministry of Energy and Mining (here for convenience called \"the Ministry\") and PetroEcuador as \"one Party\" and TexPet as \"the other party\" initialed and signed a written agreement entitled \"Contract for Implementing of Environmental, Remedial Work and Release from Obligations, Liability and Claims\", for ease of reference described in these arbitration proceedings as the \"1995 Settlement Agreement\".\n\n18.\n\nThe 1995 Settlement Agreement was made on the Ministry's headed note-paper with the Respondent's coat-of-arms; and it was signed for that Ministry by the Minister of Energy and Mines. It was also signed by a senior officer of PetroEcuador and two representatives of TexPet (now, but not then, indirectly owned by Chevron), one of whom was Dr Ricardo Reis Vega, a factual witness in Track I.\n\n19.\n\nThe 1995 Settlement Agreement provided in the final two paragraphs of its preamble that TexPet agreed to undertake the \"Environmental Remedial Work in consideration for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations.\" By Article 1.3, the term \"Environmental Impact\" included: \"[a]ny solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present or released into the environment in such concentration or condition, the presence or release of which causes, or has the potential to cause harm to human health or the environment.\"\n\n20.\n\nAs contemplated in the earlier 1994 MOU between the same signatory parties (which was to be substituted and become void by Article 9.6 and the last paragraph of Annex \"A\" of the 1995 Settlement Agreement), the 1995 Settlement Agreement, subject to its terms: (i) released TexPet from the Respondent's and PetroEcuador's claims based upon Environmental Impact (except for claims related to TexPet's performance of the Scope of Work); and (ii) provided that TexPet would be released from all remaining environmental liability upon completion of the remediation obligations described in that Scope of Work.\n\n21.\n\nArticle 1.12 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement defined such release, as follows: \"The release, under the provisions of Article V of this Contract, of all legal and contractual obligations and liability, towards the Government and Petroecuador, for the Environmental Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium, including any claims that the Government and Petroecuador have, or may have against Texpet, arising out of the Consortium Agreements.\" The term \"Operations of the Consortium\" was defined as \"Those oil exploration and production operations carried out under the Consortium Agreement\", i.e. the 1973 Concession Agreement (ibid).\n\n22.\n\nArticle 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (\"Article V\") in turn provided (inter alia):\n\n\"On the execution date of this Contract [i.e. 4 May 1995], and in consideration of Texpet's agreement to perform the Environmental Remedial Work in accordance with the Scope of Work set out in Annex A, and the Remedial Action Plan, *the Government* and Petroecuador *shall hereby release, acquit and forever discharge Texpet*, Texaco Petroleum Company, Compa\u00f1ia Texaco de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador, S.A., Texaco Inc., *and all their respective* agents, servants, employees, officers, directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs, administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, *principals and subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Releasees') of all the Government's and Petroecuador's claims against the Releasees for Environmental Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium,* except for those related to the obligations contracted hereunder for the performance by Texpet of the Scope of Work (Annex A)...\"\n\nThe Tribunal has here emphasised the wording critical to the Parties' disputed interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, to which the Tribunal necessarily returns below. The Government's \"claims\" were addressed in Article 5.2.\n\n23.\n\nArticle 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement provided:\n\n\"*The Government and Petroecuador intend claims to mean any and all claims, rights to Claims, debts, liens, common or civil law or equitable causes of actions and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or regulatory causes of action and penalties (including, but not limited to, causes of action under Article 19-2 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador,* Decree No. 1459 of 1971, Decree No. 925 of 1973, the Water Act, R.O. 233 of 1973, ORO No. 530 of 1974, Decree No. 374 of 1976, Decree No. 101 of 1982, or Decree No. 2144 of 1989, or any other applicable law or regulation of the Republic of Ecuador), costs, lawsuits, settlements and attorneys' fees (past, present, future, known or unknown) *, that the Government or Petroecuador have, or ever may have against each Releasee for or in any way related to contamination, that have or ever may arise in the future, directly or indirectly arising out of Operations of the Consortium,* including but not limited to consequences of all types of injury that the Government or Petroecuador may allege concerning persons, properties, business, reputations, and all other types of injuries that may be measured in money, including but not limited to, trespass, nuisance, negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, or any other theory or potential theory of recovery.\"\n\nThe Tribunal has here again emphasised the wording most critical to the Parties' disputed interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n24.\n\nThe reference in Article 5.2 to Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution (being the 1978 Constitution effective in 1979 and, as later amended, in force in 1995) signified a cause of action available to the Respondent under Title II, Section 1 (On the Rights of People/Individuals1) whereby the Ecuadorian State guaranteed to each person, inter alia (in English translation): \"\u2026 the right to live in an environment that is free from contamination. It is the duty of the State to ensure that this right is not negatively affected and to foster the preservation of nature \u2026\". The fuller text of Article 19-2 in Spanish provides: \"Sin perjuicio de otros derechos necesarios para el pleno desenvolvimiento moral y material que se deriva de la persona, el Estado le garantiza: \u2026. El derecho de vivir en un medio ambiente libre de contaminaci\u00f3n. Es deber del Estado velar por que este derecho no sea afectado y tutelar la preservaci\u00f3n de la naturaleza. La ley establecer\u00e1 las restricciones al ejercicio de determinados derechos o libertades para proteger el medio ambiente\". The reference to Decree No. 374 of 1976 signified a cause of action available to the Respondent on the prevention and control of pollution. The reference to the Water Act of 1973 and Decree No. 2144 of 1989 signified causes of action available to the Respondent in regard to water resources and water contamination. The reference to ORO No 530 signified the Regulations for the Exploration and Exploration of Hydrocarbons of 9 April 1974.\n\nThe Claimants translate the Spanish term \"las personas\" as \"people\" or \"persons\" [D3,523]; and the Respondent as \"individuals\" and \"persons\" [D1.74 & D3,580]. In the Tribunal's view, these differences in English translation are not material to its decisions in this Partial Award.\n\n25.\n\nThe references to \"the Government\" in Articles 1.12 and 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, rather than the Ministry, is explained by the facts that the 1973 Concession Agreement was made between (inter alios) TexPet and the Respondent's Government (albeit acting by the Ministry) and that, as appears from the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the release was directed, in substantial part, to settling claims arising from that 1973 Concession Agreement (including its section 46). Moreover, Article 9.1 of 1995 Settlement Agreement as regards notices thereunder identified the Ministry as representing the Government. In any event, the Ministry, forming part of the Government, acted for the Government in concluding the 1995 Settlement Agreement and, constitutionally, the Respondent is therefore to be treated under Ecuadorian law as a signatory party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n26.\n\nArticle 9.3 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement contained a \"Whole Contract\" provision: namely:\n\n\"This Contract contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the Parties hereto with respect to the Environmental Remedial Work and to all matters which in any way may affect said Environmental Remedial Work. No other agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding this Contract, shall be deemed to exist or to bind the Parties hereto.\"\n\n27.\n\nArticle 9.4 curtailed any benefit for \"a third party\", namely (under the Parties' different English translations from the Spanish version)2:\n\nThe Claimants: \"This Contract shall not be construed to confer any benefit on any third party not a Party to this Contract, nor shall it provide any rights to such third party to enforce its provisions.\"\n\nThe Respondent: \"This Contract shall not be construed to confer benefits on third parties who are not a part of this Contract, nor shall it provide rights to third parties to enforce its provisions.\"\n\nThe term \"third party\" or \"third parties\" was not defined in the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\nAs noted, the first English translation is advanced by the Claimants [D1.57-58]; and the second is advanced by the Respondent [D3,575]. In the Tribunal's view, these differences are not material to its decisions in this Partial Award.\n\n28.\n\nAnnex \"A\" to the 1995 Settlement Agreement contained the Scope of the Environmental Remedial and Mitigation Work and Socio-Economic Compensation to be undertaken by TexPet. It was separately signed by the signatory parties. Section VII.C of Annex \"A\" provided:\n\n\"C. Negotiations with the Municipalities of Lago Agrio (Nueva Loja), Shushufindi, Joya de los Sachas and Francisco de Orellana (Coca).\n\nWithout prejudice to that agreed in this Scope of Remedial Work and in the Memorandum of Understanding of December 14, 1994, Texpet pledges to continue negotiations with the aforementioned Municipalities, in order to establish the participation of Texpet in the performance of the work based on projects on drinking water and/or construction of sewers and latrines in the corresponding canton seats. The results of such negotiations shall be independent from the current Scope and the Contract for Implementing the Environmental Remedial Work and Release of Obligations to be executed by the parties, nor shall they affect the performance of such Scope and Contract.\n\nThe work that cannot be covered with the funds arising from the negotiations with Texpet shall be supplemented pursuant to Art. 3 of Executive Decree 675 of April 15, 1993, published in Registro Oficial No.174 of the 22nd of the same month and year.\"\n\n29.\n\nThe 1995 Settlement Agreement contained no express provision for applicable law(s), dispute settlement or forum selection. It is nonetheless common ground between the Parties (together with their respective expert witnesses) that Ecuadorian law applies to its interpretation and effect, that agreed approach being here confirmed by the Tribunal for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings under Article 33 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n30.\n\n*(ii) The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases:* As provided by Annex \"A\" to the 1995 Settlement Agreement (cited above), TexPet subsequently settled disputes with the four municipalities of the Oriente Region (Sushufindi, Francisco de Orellana (Coca), Lago Agrio and Joya de los Sachas), under written agreements made with these municipalities, as also the Province of Sucumb\u00edos and the Napo consortium of municipalities (herein, for ease of reference, collectively called the \"Municipal and Provincial Releases\"). Under these six settlements, four of which were approved by the Ecuadorian courts owing to their nature as litigious disputes, TexPet, together with non-signatory parties (as explained below), were released from liability to these municipalities for the Consortium's activities in the area of the concession. The Respondent, including its Ministry, were not signatory parties to these 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases, which were of course all made after the 1995 Settlement Agreement. (The 1995 Settlement Agreement was not approved by any Ecuadorian court, not then having a litigious nature between its signatory parties).\n\n31.\n\nThe Municipal and Provincial Releases provided (inter alia) for a release in somewhat different terms from Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. For example, the fifth provision of the Release of 2 May 1996 made by the Province of Sucumb\u00edos extended to (as here translated into English): \" \u2026. Texaco Petroleum Company, Texas Petroleum Company, Compa\u00f1ia Texaco de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador, S.A., Texaco Inc., and any other affiliate, subsidiary or other related companies, and all their agents, employees, executives, directors, legal representatives, insurers, lawyers, guarantors, heirs, administrators, contractors, subcontractors, successors or predecessors \u2026.\"\n\n32.\n\n*(iii) The 1998 Final Release* : On 30 September 1998, pursuant to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent (acting by its Minister of Energy and Mines), PetroEcuador, PetroProduccion and TexPet executed the *Acta Final*, certifying that TexPet had performed all its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and, in accordance with its terms, releasing TexPet from (as specified) any environmental liability arising from the Consortium's operations.\n\n33.\n\nArticle IV of the Final Release provided (inter alia) as follows, in English translation:\n\n\" \u2026 The Government and PetroEcuador proceed to release, absolve and discharge TexPet, Texas Petroleum Company, Compa\u00f1ia Texaco de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador, S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees, officers, directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs, administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals and subsidiaries forever, from any liability and claims by the Government of the Republic of Ecuador, PetroEcuador and its Affiliates, for items related to the obligations assumed by TexPet in the aforementioned Contract [the 1995 Settlement Agreement]...\"\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the critical contractual wording at issue in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement is materially the same in Article IV of the Final Release; and, accordingly, the issues relating to the latter's interpretation and effect are here treated as the same issues relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n***PART C: THE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE CASES***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\n*Introduction:* In the Tribunal's view, as explained later in this Partial Award, the Parties' disputed interpretation turns upon a few crucial Spanish words in Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement to be construed under the relevant rules of Ecuadorian law on contractual interpretation. Although the materials submitted by the Parties are voluminous, the essential issues of legal interpretation, whilst perhaps difficult, are relatively short and uncomplicated.\n\n35.\n\nGiven also the limited approach taken by the Tribunal in this Partial Award as to the legal effect of that interpretation under Ecuadorian law, it is unnecessary here to summarise in full the Parties' respective cases relating to Track I. In particular, as explained further below, the Tribunal does not here decide the full legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with the 1998 Final Release) as claimed in the Parties' respective claims for relief, as set out below later in this Part C.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal has nonetheless considered the Parties' submissions and claimed relief at length; and the omission here of any reference to any part of such cases should not be taken as signifying otherwise. However, apart from issues and relief already reserved to Track II and given that part of the issues under Track I are here deferred to Track II by decision of the Tribunal, any part of such case not here addressed should not be taken as having been implicitly decided by the Tribunal one way or the other in this Partial Award.\n\n37.\n\n*The Claimants' Case:* In summary, the Claimants contend that, under Ecuadorian law, Chevron is a \"Releasee\" under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and is also not an excluded \"third party\" beneficiary under Article 9.4 prevented from exercising its contractual rights in full as a Releasee, directly by itself or indirectly through TexPet. The Claimants submit that Chevron, following the \u2018reverse triangular merger' with Texaco Inc. (\"Texaco) between 15 October 2000 and 1 November 2001, became TexPet's indirect owner, controller and ultimate parent company, thereby falling within the meaning of the Spanish term \"principales\" listed for release in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Claimants emphasise that the contrary argument is made by the Respondent for the very first time in these arbitration proceedings.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Chevron, Texaco and TexPet were and remain separate and distinct corporations; and that, whilst Chevron is not the \"successor-in-interest\" with regard to any of liabilities of Texaco or TexPet, Chevron submits that the context of the term \"principales\" in Article 5.1 shows an objective intent under Ecuadorian law to release future parent corporations (such as Chevron) and does not signify only a principal in a principal-agent relationship. The Claimants invoke three particular points in support of their case.\n\n39.\n\nFirst, a \"holistic\" reading of Article 5.1 reveals the Parties' objective intent to release parent corporations because the long and broad list of 22 categories of Releasees establishes an intent to release broadly all individuals and companies which might ever be alleged to be responsible for the conduct of TexPet, necessarily including a future parent company of TexPet. Conversely, with such an extensive list (including expressly TexPet's existing parent company, Texaco), there is no evidence from this contractual wording of any intent to exclude any future parent company as a Releasee.\n\n40.\n\nSecond, when coupled with \"subsidiarias\" in Article 5.1, the common legal and business language use of \"principales\" signifies a parent company. As submitted in paragraph 222 of the Claimants' Reply Memorial - Track I:\n\n\"A grammatical analysis of the phrase *principales y subsidiarias* is revealing of their meaning and use. Linguistically, the terms *principales y subsidiarias*, as used in Article 5.1, are attributive nouns - that is, they are adjectives acting as nouns in this instance. This linguistic phenomenon, known as the \"attributive noun\" or \"nominalization of the adjective\" (in Spanish, \"*sustantivaci\u00f3n del adjetivo*\"), occurs when the noun that the adjective complements is not included in the sentence, causing the adjective to become the noun in the phrase by taking the place of the missing noun. In this case, *principales y subsidiarias* is short form for *las compa\u00f1\u00edas principales y subsidiarias* (principal and subsidiary companies). The parties omitted the word \"companies,\" thereby transforming *principales y subsidiarias* into nouns. The phenomenon of the attributive noun occurs frequently in the Spanish language, and its use is well documented [citation omitted]. It also occurs frequently in English [citation omitted]. For instance, the word *subsidiary* is an attributive noun for the full phrase *subsidiary corporation* [citation omitted]. The fact that the Spanish *subsidiarias* is in the feminine gender (which coordinates with *compa\u00f1\u00edas* [companies] *corporaciones* (corporations), *sociedades* (companies or societies), *entidades* (entities), or *empresas* (enterprises) - all feminine nouns) further supports this reading [citation omitted]. This analysis is important because, as shown below [paragraphs 220ff], in the Spanish legal and business contexts, *principales* and *subsidiarias* are often used as nouns and adjectives, always maintaining their core meaning.\"\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants therefore reject as inapposite the Respondent's reliance upon the Ecuadorian Commercial Code which defines \"principales\" as a principal corresponding to agency; and they refer to the supporting expert testimony of Dr Coronel and Dr Barros to such effect. Given the common use of the term \"principales\" to mean a parent company when paired with the term \"subsidiarias\", the Claimants submit that it would be implausible that, in drafting Article 5.1, there was any objective intention to displace its ordinary meaning with a narrow technical meaning drawn from the law of agency.\n\n42.\n\nThird, the context of the word \"principales\" within the 1995 Settlement Agreement shows an objective intention to mean parent corporations; and, under Ecuadorian law, the interpretation of a contractual term is to be made in its contractual context, as provided by Article 1580 of the Civil Code. Such contractual context here comprises (paragraph 229, ibid):\n\n\" (i) The pairing of *principales* with *subsidarias* (as in *principales y subsidiarias*) shows the intent to use them as correlatives;\n\n(ii) The term *principales* is not coupled with *agentes*, which appears at the opposite end of the long list of Releasees (there are 15 categories of releasees separating them), which evidences an intent not to give *principales* a meaning within the agency context;\n\n(iii) Article 1.12 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement shows an overall intent to cover all persons related to TexPet;\n\n(iv) The Settlement Agreement's express naming of Texaco Inc. and its successors evidences an intent to cover all present and future owners and parent companies that enter the corporate structure; and\n\n(v) A harmonious and good-faith interpretation militates against an interpretation that covers only current affiliate companies in the corporate ownership structure, but excludes future companies.\"\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases are relevant, under Ecuadorian law, to the interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement because, with the 1998 Final Release, they all form part of the same overall transaction with mutual cross-references. Under the different wording of those 1996 Releases, Chevron would manifestly benefit from a release as TexPet's parent company; and accordingly the Claimants submit that this contractual documentation evidences a common intention in related transactions to release a future parent company of TexPet in the absence of any objective evidence indicating any contrary intention.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement does not preclude unnamed non-signatory \"Releasees\" from enforcing their contractual rights against the Respondent affirmatively. A Releasee is not a third party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, but a party to or part of such Agreement, as the Respondent had originally conceded in Paragraph 134 of its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction. With such contractual rights, so the Claimants contend, there is nothing in the 1995 Settlement Agreement to indicate that these rights can only be exercised by any Releasee defensively and not offensively, by way of a claim for damages, declaratory relief or specific performance against the Respondent.\n\n45.\n\nAs to the legal effect of their interpretation, it is the Claimants' case that the causes of action expressly described in Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and for which Chevron is released as a Releasee include all \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" environmental rights exerciseable only by the Respondent in the general public interest \"on behalf of the community\" (which were therefore capable of settlement and release by the Respondent under the 1995 Settlement Agreement), as distinct from causes of action available to private individuals making claims for their own personal harm caused by environmental pollution (which were not compromised under the 1995 Settlement Agreement). The Claimants' case relies (inter alia) upon the expert testimony of Dr Barros, Dr Coronel and Professor Oquendo.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the 1995 Settlement Agreement was not intended to bar and does not bar any environmental claims by individuals for personal harm suffered by those individuals, including other so-called \"cow claims\". At the time when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was made, whilst collective and diffuse rights existed under Ecuadorian law, according to the Claimants, no private individual without a claim for personal harm had legal standing to bring any environmental claim (for remediation or damages) in respect of such collective or diffuse rights. As explained by Counsel for Chevron in its closing oral submissions: \"\u2026 I don't think it has to do with the nature of the right itself, because the right did exist [in 1995]. The right was there. It's that the right could be exercised by the Government on behalf of the people to protect the people but there wasn't a direct action by the people to enforce that\" and \"\u2026 before the EMA in 1999 [i.e. the 1999 Environmental Management Act], the Aguinda plaintiffs did not have standing to vindicate the diffuse rights of the community. That was left to the Government, the Government had that power and that standing\" [D3,529 & 541].\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Lago Agrio Litigation, in contrast to the earlier Aguinda Litigation in New York, concerns environmental claims for collective or diffuse rights for unidentified persons which are precluded by the release in the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as a matter of res judicata and collateral estoppel under Ecuadorian law applicable to settlements (Article 2362 of the Civil Code3 and/or by analogy of law under Article 18 of the Civil Code); and that none of these claims are made by private individuals for their own personal harm, in contrast to the claims by identifiable persons made in the Aguinda Litigation in New York which involved only individual rights, with claims in respect of personal harm.\n\nArticle 2362 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*La transacci\u00f3n surte el efecto de cosa juzgada en \u00faltima instancia; pero podr\u00e1 pedirse la declaraci\u00f3n de nulidad o la rescisi\u00f3n, en conformidad a los art\u00edculos precedentes*\".\n\n48.\n\n*The Claimants' Claimed Relief* : As regards the formal relief claimed by the Claimants in regard to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, it is necessary to recite in full Paragraph 272 of the Claimants Reply Memorial \u2013 Track I, as follows:\n\n\"272. Accordingly, Claimants request a Partial Award that effectively protects Claimants' rights, and reverses (as far as possible) the harmful effects of Ecuador's breaches of the Settlement Agreements [i.e. the 1995 Settlement Agreement and 1998 Final Release] and its international-law obligations. To achieve this result, Claimants respectfully submit the following list of requests, from which the Tribunal can fashion a combination of declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief in protection of Claimants' rights [footnote here omitted].\n\nA. Specific Performance\n\n1. Order that Ecuador specifically perform the Settlement Agreements.\n\nB. Declaratory Relief\n\n(i) Scope of the Settlement Agreements\n\n1. Declare that both Claimants are \"Releasees\" under the Settlement Agreements, and were released from all diffuse environmental claims arising from TexPet's operations in Ecuador; and\n\n2. Declare that the claims pleaded in the Lago Agrio Litigation (and upon which the Lago Agrio Judgment is based) are the same diffuse environmental claims settled and released in the Settlement Agreements.\n\n(ii) Legal Effect of the Settlement Agreements\n\n1. Declare that Claimants have no liability or responsibility for satisfying the Lago Agrio Judgment because they were fully released for all such claims by the Settlement Agreements;\n\n2. Declare that the claims pleaded in the Lago Agrio Litigation (and upon which the Lago Agrio Judgment were based) are barred by *res judicata* and collateral estoppel;\n\n3. Declare that under the Settlement Agreements, Claimants have no further liability or responsibility for diffuse environmental claims in Ecuador for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations, or for performing any further environmental remediation;\n\n4. Declare that Ecuador (through its various branches of Government) has breached the Settlement Agreements, *inter alia*, by refusing to specifically perform the Settlement Agreements, by refusing to ensure Claimants' enjoyment of their releases and their right to be free of litigation, by refusing to dismiss the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims, by refusing to indemnify Chevron for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims, by seeking to comply with this Tribunal's Interim Awards;\n\n5. Declare that Ecuador's actions have breached the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, including its obligations to afford fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, effective means of enforcing rights, and to observe obligations it entered into under the overall investment agreements;\n\n6. Declare that enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment within or without Ecuador would be inconsistent with Ecuador's obligations under the Settlement Agreements, the BIT and international law;\n\n7. Declare that the Lago Agrio Judgment is a nullity as a matter of international law; and\n\n8. Declare that: (i) the Judgment is not final, enforceable, or conclusive under Ecuadorian and international law, and thus, is not subject to recognition and enforcement within or without Ecuador; (ii) any enforcement of the Judgment would place Ecuador in violation of its international-law obligations; (iii) the Judgment violates international public policy and natural justice, and as a matter of international comity and public policy, the Judgment should not be recognized and enforced.\n\nC. Injunctive Relief\n\n1. Order Ecuador to use all measures necessary to comply with its obligations under the Settlement Agreements to release Claimants (and to ensure that Claimants may effectively enjoy the benefits of such releases) from any liability or responsibility for the Lago Agrio Judgment in Ecuador or in any other country;\n\n2. Order Ecuador to use all measures necessary to prevent the Lago Agrio Judgment from becoming final, conclusive, or enforceable in Ecuador or in any other country;\n\n3. Order Ecuador to use all measures necessary to stay or enjoin enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, including enjoining the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs from obtaining any related attachments, levies, or other enforcement devices in Ecuador or in any other country;\n\n4. Order Ecuador to use all measures necessary to revoke and nullify the Judgment;\n\n5. Order Ecuador to make a written representation to any court in which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs attempt to recognize and enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment that: (i) the claims that formed the basis of the Judgment were released by the Government;\n\n(ii) the Lago Agrio Court had no personal or subject-matter jurisdiction over Chevron;\n\n(iii) the Judgment is a legal nullity; (iv) the Judgment is not final, enforceable, or conclusive under Ecuadorian and international law, and thus, is not subject to recognition and enforcement within or without Ecuador; (v) any enforcement of the Judgment would place Ecuador in violation of its international-law obligations; (vi) the Judgment violates international public policy and natural justice; (vii) any enforcement proceedings should be stayed pending the Tribunal's final award in this arbitration; and (viii) as a matter of international comity and public policy, the Judgment should not be recognized and enforced; and\n\n6. Order that, in the event that any court orders the recognition or enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, Ecuador must satisfy the Judgment directly.\n\nD. Damages, Costs and Attorneys' Fees\n\n1. Award Claimants full indemnification and damages against Ecuador in connection with the Lago Agrio Judgment, including a specific obligation by Ecuador to pay Claimants the sum of money awarded in the Judgment;\n\n2. Award Claimants any sums of money that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or others collect against Claimants or their affiliates in connection with enforcing the Judgment in any forum, with such sums to be paid by Respondent;\n\n3. Award all costs and attorneys' fees incurred by Claimants in (i) defending the Lago Agrio Litigation, (ii) pursuing this arbitration, (iii) opposing the efforts by Ecuador and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to stay this arbitration through litigation in the United States; and (iv) preparing for and defending against enforcement actions brought by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. These amounts will be quantified at the time and in the manner ordered by this Tribunal;\n\n4. Award both pre- and post-award interest (compounded quarterly) until the date of payment; and\n\n5. Award such other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper, including any specific relief appropriate to wipe out all consequences of Respondent's breaches of the Settlement Agreements and its violations of its obligations under the Interim Awards, the BIT and international law.\"\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal has here recited such relief in full, although it exceeds in part the issues intended to be addressed in Track I under the Tribunal's Procedural Order No 10. The Tribunal has also taken note of the Claimants' written requests for relief submitted by their Counsel at the November Hearing made in materially similar terms [D1.31].\n\n50.\n\n*The Respondent's Case:* In summary, the Respondent denies that under Ecuadorian law Chevron is a \"Releasee\" under Article 5.1 or otherwise entitled to take advantage of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, to which it is an excluded \"third party\" under Article 9.4. Further, even if Chevron were a Releasee, the 1995 Settlement Agreement creates under Ecuadorian law no res judicata effect (nor any collateral estoppel) upon any of the plaintiffs' claims in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n51.\n\nAs already noted, the Respondent takes issue with the Claimants' interpretation of Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent submits that the Claimants' characterisation of Chevron as TexPet's \"principal\" within the list of \"Releasees\" is misplaced because it is based only upon Chevron's indirect shareholding in TexPet, rather than on any relationship of principal and agent between Chevron and TexPet, as required by the contractual wording.\n\n52.\n\nAs to agency, the Respondent contends that Chevron has consistently denied any agency relationship with TexPet. The Respondent further contends that, even if there were any agency relationship between Chevron and TexPet following the merger between Texaco and Chevron, there could have been no agency relationship in relation to TexPet's operations which caused environmental damage since those operations had ended in 1992, some nine years before that merger.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Chevron cannot therefore be a \"Releasee\" under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement because it is not there specified by name and the relevant evidence does not establish any intention to derogate from the plain meaning of the contractual terms, to be interpreted under Ecuadorian law. Under Ecuadorian law, the word \"principales\" refers only to the principal in the ordinary principal-agent representative relationship, thereby excluding Chevron.\n\n54.\n\nAs to the Claimants' arguments based on the comprehensive nature of the list of Releasees in Article 5.1, the Respondent relies upon the Latin maxim \u2018inclusio unius est exclusio alterius' as a canon of construction under Ecuadorian law. The Respondent rejects the relevance of the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases as an aid to interpreting the Article 5.1 because the Respondent did not agree such a release in Article 5.1, which is differently worded and made between different signatory parties; and, in any event, such materials are excluded from consideration by virtue of Article 9.3 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. As to the Claimants' linguistic arguments, the Respondent contends that the Spanish word \"matriz\" means parent company and that \"principales\" is not its substitute as an attributive noun; and in any event, if all parent companies had been intended to be released, that the Spanish term \"las compa\u00f1\u00edas\" would have been used in Article 5.1. As to contractual context, the Respondent submits that there is no context in which the adjective \"principales\", without being further defined, could ever serve to release all future parent companies in a contract governed by Ecuadoran law. Lastly, in the event of any ambiguity in the interpretation of Article 5.1, the Respondent contends that such ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the Respondent as the obligor under Article 1582 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, as supported by the expert testimony of Professor Salgado.\n\n55.\n\nEven if Chevron were a Releasee within Article 5.1, the Respondent contends that Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement expressly prohibits any person other than the signatory parties from exercising the right, offensively, to bring a claim under the terms of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Under its corrected translation (the second set out in Paragraph 27 above), whilst the Respondent accepts that a nonsignatory Releasee is \"part of\" the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent submits that such a Releasee is nonetheless a third party and, as such, acquires no rights to enforce the provisions of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as also supported by the expert testimony of Professor Salgado.\n\n56.\n\nThis disability is not cured, according to the Respondent, by TexPet as a signatory party and the Second Claimant in these arbitration proceedings because TexPet has no standing to bring any contractual claim for breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Under Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code,4 TexPet was free to contract in favour of a third person, but only that third person can sue for itself under that contract and accordingly TexPet cannot bring any claim in these proceedings for the benefit of Chevron under the 1995 Settlement Agreement; nor can TexPet bring any claim thereunder for itself not being a party to the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\nArticle 1465 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*Cualquiera puede* *estipular a favor de una tercera persona, aunque no tenga derecho para representarla; pero s\u00f3lo esa tercera persona podr\u00e1 demandar lo estipulado; y mientras no intervenga su aceptaci\u00f3n expresa o t\u00e1cita, es revocable el contrato por la sola voluntad de las partes que concurrieron a \u00e9l. Constituyen aceptaci\u00f3n t\u00e1cita los actos que s\u00f3lo hubieran podido ejecutarse en virtud del contrato*\".\n\n57.\n\nWhether or not Chevron is a Releasee, it is the Respondent's further case that, in agreeing the releases in Article 15.2, the Respondent was not acting in any representational capacity exercising \"diffuse\" or \"collective rights\" on behalf of Ecuadorian individuals but acting only in its capacity as a co-contractual party to the 1973 Concession Agreement. As regards the former, Counsel for the Respondent explained in its closing oral submissions: \"There was no law in 1995 that recognized diffuse rights. The concept of collective rights was introduced in Ecuadorian legislation for the first time in the 1998 Constitution, or the constitutional reform of 1998, and the concept of diffuse interest was defined for the first time in 1999, one year later in the Environmental Management Act referred to as EMA\" [D3,579-580].\n\n58.\n\nFurther, as the laws of Ecuador stood in 1995, the Respondent submits that it had no power to represent the Ecuadorian people in regard to their individual rights and that individuals could bring personal claims and recover damages under Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution, referring to (inter alia) the court decisions in the Guti\u00e9rrez case of September 29, 1993 and, albeit after 1995, the Delfina Torres case of 19 March 2003.5 As regards diffuse rights existing under Article 19-2 at the time of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent contends that \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" environmental rights did not exist under Ecuadorian law until 1998/1999, after the 1995 Settlement Agreement and 1998 Final Release [D1,158ffx & D1,187ffxx].\n\nThe Angel Guti\u00e9rrez case of 29 September 1993, Quito, Judicial Gazette, Year XCIV, Series XVI, No 1, p 11 [RLA-285]; and the Delfina Torres case of 19 March 2003, Quito,, File 229, Official Register 43 [RLA-286].\n\n59.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent contends that the 1995 Settlement Agreement was not intended to bar and could not create any bar under Ecuadorian law to individuals later bringing claims for environmental remediation (after 1999), both as individual claims for personal harm and also as claims for \"diffuse\" or \"collective rights\" under Article 19-2 or any of the other provisions of Ecuadorian law listed in Article 5.2. The Respondent relies (inter alia) upon the expert testimony of Professors Eguiguren and Professor Le Chatelier.\n\n60.\n\n*The Respondent's Claimed Relief* : It is likewise necessary to set out in full below the relief requested by the Respondent in Track I, as pleaded in Paragraph 192 of its Rejoinder on the Merits \u2013 Track I (here with added paragraph numbers):\n\n\"192. Based on the foregoing, the Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal issue an Award that:\n\n(i) Denies all the relief and each remedy requested by Claimants in relation to Track 1, including the relief and remedies requested in Paragraph 272 of Claimants' Reply on the Merits [recited above];\n\n(ii) Declares that Chevron is not a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and therefore has no basis to assert claims under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty;\n\n(iii) Dismisses Chevron's claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release on the merits, should the Tribunal find that Chevron has standing in this Arbitration as a matter of jurisdiction;\n\n(iv) Declares that TexPet does not have standing to assert claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a matter of Ecuadorian law;\n\n(v) Dismisses TexPet's claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release on the merits;\n\n(vi) Declares specifically that the Respondent has not breached the 1995 Settlement Agreement or the 1998 Final Release;\n\n(vii) Dismisses all of Claimants' claims as they relate to the 1996 Local Settlements [i.e. the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases], both as a matter of jurisdiction and on the merits;\n\n(viii) Declares further that the Respondent is under no obligation to indemnify, protect, defend or otherwise hold Claimants harmless against claims by, or judgments or other relief obtained by, third parties including the claims filed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the Lago Agrio Judgment, and the enforcement thereof;\n\n(ix) Declares that the 1995 Settlement Agreement has no effect on third parties, and specifically, that the release of liability contained therein does not extend to rights and claims potentially held by third parties or could otherwise bar third-party claims arising from the environmental impact;\n\n(x) Declares that the Lago Agrio Litigation was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel;\n\n(xi) Awards Respondent all costs and attorneys' fees incurred by Respondent in connection with this phase of the proceedings; and that\n\n(xii) Awards Respondent any further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.\"\n\n61.\n\nAs the Respondent recognised at the time of the November Hearing, this requested relief, pleaded in direct response to the Claimants' requested relief extending beyond the issues under Track I, itself extends in part beyond Track I.\n\n***PART D: THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSES AND DECISIONS***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\n*I Introduction \u2013 Legal Interpretation:* As already indicated above, the Tribunal considers that the relevant issues of contractual interpretation under the 1995 Settlement Agreement are, ultimately, relatively short and uncomplicated. The Tribunal sets out below the relevant Ecuadorian rules on contractual interpretation, followed by an analysis of the testimony by the Parties' expert witnesses relevant to the issues of contractual interpretation, before analyzing and deciding upon its own interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n63.\n\n*(i) The Relevant Rules:* The Parties agree that the 1995 Settlement Agreement should be interpreted in the light of Ecuadorian law as at the time when it was executed [D3,507 & D3,577]. The Parties also referred to the joint expert report of Dr Enrique Barros, Dr C\u00e9sar Coronel and Professor Roberto Salgado of 6 August 2012 which contains a helpful summary of the Ecuadorian legal rules of contractual interpretation relevant to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as agreed by these Parties' three expert witnesses. The Tribunal is content to adopt and apply these rules for the purpose of this Partial Award, as follows (here translated from the original Spanish):\n\n\" (i) For purposes of interpreting the aforementioned contract signed in Ecuador, Ecuadorian laws are the applicable laws.\n\n(ii) The laws in effect when the agreement was executed must also be understood to be incorporated into the contract (Article 7, number eighteen, Civil Code).6\n\n(iii) The Ecuadorian rules for interpreting the contract are those established in Title XIII of the Fourth Book of the Civil Code, Articles 1576 \u2013 1582.\n\n(iv) The relevant rules \u2026 are essentially the following:\n\n[a] No matter how general the terms of a contract are, they will apply only to the matter which the parties have contracted about (Article 1577).7\n\n[b] The meaning in which an article can produce some effect must take precedence over that in which it cannot produce any effect at all (Article 1578).8\n\n[c] In those cases where there is no contrary intent, the interpretation that best squares with the nature of the contract must be adhered to (Article 1579).9\n\n[d] The articles of a contract will be interpreted in light of the others, according to each the meaning that best suits the contract as a whole (Article 1580, first subsection).10\n\n[e] If none of the above rules of interpretation are applicable, ambiguous articles will be interpreted in favor of the obligor. But the ambiguous articles that have been drafted or dictated by one of the parties, whether obligee or obligor, will be interpreted against that party, provided that the ambiguity stems from a lack of an explanation that that party should have provided.11\"\n\nArticle 7 of the Civil Code provides in its original Spanish, in relevant part: \"*La ley no dispone sino para lo venidero: no tiene efecto retroactivo; y en conflicto de una ley posterior con otra anterior, se observar\u00e1n las reglas siguientes: \u2026. En todo contrato se entender\u00e1n incorporadas las leyes vigentes al tiempo de su celebraci\u00f3n*\".\n\nArticle 1577 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*Por generales que sean los t\u00e9rminos de un contrato, s\u00f3lo se aplicar\u00e1n a la materia sobre que se ha contratado*\".\n\nArticle 1578 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*El sentido en que una cl\u00e1usula puede surtir alg\u00fan efecto deber\u00e1 preferirse a aqu\u00e9l en que no sea capaz de surtir efecto alguno*\".\n\nArticle 1579 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*En los casos en que no apareciere voluntad contraria, deber\u00e1 estarse a la interpretaci\u00f3n que m\u00e1s bien cuadre la naturaleza del contrato.*  *Las cl\u00e1usulas de uso com\u00fan se presumen aunque no se expresen*\".\n\nArticle 1580 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*Las cl\u00e1usulas de un contrato se interpretar\u00e1n unas por otras, d\u00e1ndose a cada una el sentido que mejor convenga al contrato en su totalidad. Podr\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n interpretarse por las de otro contrato entre las mismas partes y sobre la misma materia. O por la aplicaci\u00f3n pr\u00e1ctica que hayan hecho de ella ambas partes, o una de las partes con aprobaci\u00f3n de la otra*\".\n\nArticle 1582 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*No pudiendo aplicarse ninguna de las reglas precedentes de interpretaci\u00f3n, se interpretar\u00e1n las cl\u00e1usulas ambiguas a favor del deudor. Pero las cl\u00e1usulas ambiguas que hayan sido extendidas o dictadas por una de las partes, sea acreedora o deudora, se interpretar\u00e1n contra ella, siempre que la ambig\u00fcedad provenga de la* *falta de una explicaci\u00f3n que haya debido darse por ella*\".\n\n64.\n\n*(ii) The Expert Testimony:* The Tribunal here addresses (in summary) the expert testimony on the contractual meaning of the word \"principales\" under Ecuadorian law in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement *.*\n\n65.\n\nThe written reports of the Claimants' expert witnesses, principally the Second Expert Report of Dr Barros (the \"Barros Report\") and the Second Expert Report of Dr Coronel (the \"Coronel Report\"), support the Claimants' case that \"principales\" means a parent company in Article 5.1. Since Chevron is a legal person indirectly controlling and owning TexPet and is therefore to be regarded as a parent company, these two expert witnesses conclude that Chevron is a Releasee under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (and also Article IV of the Final Release).\n\n66.\n\nThe Barros Report (paragraphs 23 to 35) places special emphasis on the fact that the terms \"principales y subsidiarias\" are used jointly in the same phrase in Article 5.1, lines 8-9, of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Dr Barros takes the view that in such a context \"principales\" refers not to any principal-agent relationship under agency law, but to the parent or controlling company/subsidiary relationship from the perspective of company law.\n\n67.\n\nAmongst other factors, Dr Barros indicates that: (a) if the parties had wished to use the term \"principales\" within the context of an agency relationship, they would have mentioned it together with the terms \"agentes\" or \"mandatarios\" found at line 6 of Article 5.1, which was not the case (paragraph 26 of the Barros Report); and (b) a harmonious interpretation (paragraph 31 of the Barros Report) and a good faith interpretation (paragraph 33 of the Barros Report) of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and its Article 5.1 militate against construing the release as only covering companies or persons in the ownership structure (including TexPet), as such structure then was and not also companies or persons that come into that same structure at a later date (after 1995). Dr Barros points out that a contrary interpretation of Article 5.1 would mean that officers in charge of TexPet when the release was agreed would be covered as Releasees but not its future officers who could be still held liable (paragraph 29); and that such an interpretation would not make any sense.\n\n68.\n\nThis contextual interpretation is supported by the Coronel Report. Dr Coronel expresses the view that, through the linkage between the words \"principales\" and \"subsidiarias\", Article 5.1 should be interpreted to mean that companies above and below those there mentioned by name are covered as Releasees, thereby including Chevron (paragraph 19). In this respect, Dr Coronel also refers specifically to the provisions of the Civil Code: Article 1465, Article 1562,12 Article 1576, Article 1578 and Article 1580 (Coronel Report, paragraphs 11-15).\n\nArticle 1562 of the Civil Code in its original Spanish provides as follows: \"*Los contratos deben ejecutarse de buena fe, y por consiguiente obligan, no s\u00f3lo a lo que en ellos se expresa, sino a todas las cosas que emanan precisamente de la naturaleza de la obligaci\u00f3n, o que, por la ley o la costumbre, pertenecen a ella*\"\n\n69.\n\nBy relying upon Articles 1576 and 1580 of the Civil Code, Dr Coronel concludes that a joint reading of the definition of the release in Articles 1.12 and 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement confirms the signatory parties' intention not only to release TexPet but also \"all persons and entities related to TexPet\" (Coronel Report, paragraph 20). He testifies that Article 1.12 broadly extends the release to both legal and contractual obligations and responsibility to the Government and PetroEcuador resulting from the Consortium's Operations and relating to the environment (not limited to TexPet), and that the broad listing of related entities covered by Article 5.1 evinces an intention to extend the release broadly to companies, entities and persons not expressly mentioned or identified by name in Article 5.1.\n\n70.\n\nIn particular, Dr Coronel concludes as regards Article 5.1 that: (a) the release covers Texaco, which was then the indirect controlling and owning parent of TexPet, which means that it should also extend to companies becoming in the future the indirect controlling and owning parent of TexPet; and (b) the reference to \"successors\" indicates that entities not expressly listed by name in its text could still benefit from the release. Dr Coronel states that when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was executed it was impossible to know or even to predict that Chevron (or any other person or company) would become the controlling and/or owning parent of TexPet. Since the highest parent corporation at that time was expressly covered by the release (i.e. Texaco), a logical approach to this provision requires its meaning to cover within the release any future company replacing Texaco as TexPet's parent (Coronel Report, paragraph 20). In that sense (and only in that sense), according to Dr Coronel, Chevron is a \"successor\" of Texaco; i.e., Texaco was replaced with Chevron as an indirect controlling shareholder and parent of TexPet.\n\n71.\n\nNeither Dr Barros Report nor Dr Coronel Report denies that the term \"principales\", outside the specific context in which such term is used in Article 5.1 but within the context of an agency relationship, can mean a principal or \"mandante\". In this connection, as earlier noted in its Third Interim Award (paragraph 4.48), the Tribunal records that that the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola defines \"principal\" as follows: (i) 19th Edition (1970): \"For. El que da poder a otro para que lo represente, poderdante\"; and (ii) 22nd (last) Edition (2001): \" Der. Poderdante\". In other words, within a technical legal context (this is what the references For. or Der. stand for) \"principal\" means: who grants a power of attorney in fact).\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that examples in which such term has been used differently in the technical context of Ecuadorian corporate law (Barros Report, paragraph 25) are exceptional, as shown in the reports of the Respondent's expert witness, Professor Roberto Salgado Valdez, in particular his first report (the \"Salgado Report\").\n\n73.\n\nHowever, the Salgado Report does not go much beyond pointing out the technical legal meaning of the term \"principal\"; and, in the Tribunal's view, there is no compelling argument refuting the contextual interpretation advanced in the Barros and Coronel Reports. Professor Salgado limits himself to denying that interpretation (e.g. paragraph 20 of the Salgado Report), without addressing the analysis advanced in the Coronel and Barros Reports. Professor Salgado's subsequent testimony does not materially alter the position.\n\n74.\n\n*(iii) The Tribunal's Analysis as to Legal Interpretation:* The Tribunal considers that it falls within its task to interpret for itself the contractual wording applying the relevant rules under Ecuadorian law and not merely to adopt the conclusions reached by any one or more of the Parties' expert witnesses. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that there may be differences in approach taken by certain of these expert witnesses and the cases advanced by the Parties presenting them as expert witnesses.\n\n75.\n\nAs with all issues of contractual interpretation, it is necessary to start with the actual wording at issue, as here expressly required by Article 33(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Moreover, in the Tribunal's view, that contractual wording, being agreed by all three signatories, is by far the best objective evidence of their common intentions under Ecuadorian law.\n\n76.\n\n*Article 9.3:* The Tribunal first takes account of the whole agreement provision in Article 9.3 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Its terms are unambiguous (recited in Part B above, in English translation). For these reasons, in regard to the interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal derives no material assistance from Dr Veiga's testimony or from the terms of the release contained in any of the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases, as invoked by the Claimants.\n\n77.\n\n*The Release:* From the 1995 Settlement Agreement itself, the Tribunal notes that it takes the form of a bipartite and not a tripartite agreement, notwithstanding its three signatories. Its signatories are the same signatory parties to the 1973 Concession Agreement (as modified with PetroEcuador's novation in 1976) and the 1994 MOU. In the Tribunal's view, it is clear from this background (as expressly set out in its preamble and terms) that the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with the 1998 Final Release) was intended to address \"forever\" all possible environmental claims by the Respondent and PetroEcuador on the one side against TexPet on the other side which had arisen or could conceivably arise from the Consortium's operations under the 1973 Concession Agreement in the Oriente region of Ecuador, together with the other nine agreements listed in its Annex B.\n\n78.\n\nGiven the nature of environmental claims, these claims could not be limited to contractual claims against TexPet but extended to all \"legal\" claims, thereby including non-contractual claims, as described in the preamble's last paragraph: \" \u2026 Texpet agrees to undertake such Environmental Remedial Work in consideration for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations; \u2026\". Further, Article 1.12 defines the release in Article 5 as extending to \"all legal and contractual obligations and liability, towards the Government and Petroecuador \u2026\".; and Article 5.2 addresses \"any and all claims, rights to claims, debts, liens, common or civil law or equitable causes of actions and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or regulatory causes of action and penalties \u2026.\". Whilst the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that the 1995 Settlement Agreement addressed for the most part contractual claims against TexPet, its object was not limited to contractual claims by the Respondent and Petro-Ecuador as co-contractors, but included expressly non-contractual claims by the Respondent in its other capacities with non-contractual rights and remedies.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is nothing in the express wording of the 1995 Settlement Agreement which contains any \u2018hold harmless' provision, indemnity or duty to defend by the Respondent or PetroEcuador in the event that TexPet was sued for any legal obligation or liability for Environmental Impact arising from the Consortium's operations. The release assumes that all claims falling within the scope of the release could only be made by the Respondent (with or without PetroEcuador), thereby making such provisions inapplicable to a non-contractual claim made by a third person in its own right. Moreover, there is a significant difference between a release and an indemnity for a State: the former is usually quantifiable at the time of the release and may cost the State little or nothing, whereas the latter, lying in the future and dependent upon a third person's claim, is usually unquantifiable and potentially costly to the State.\n\n80.\n\nAt the time of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, TexPet was facing separate claims from the Municipalities, four of which had brought legal proceedings against TexPet in Ecuador. The 1995 Settlement Agreement provided no relief to TexPet in regard to such claims. To the contrary, Annex A required TexPet to negotiate settlements with these Municipalities (which it did in the form of the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases, as recited above). The 1995 Settlement Agreement also makes no mention of the Aguinda Litigation then pending in New York, to which the Respondent was not a party.\n\n81.\n\nFrom the express terms of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the release for any non-contractual claim made by the Respondent was applicable to claims in which the Respondent was asserting its own rights (in one or more of its capacities) and not to claims made by other third persons acting independently of the Respondent and asserting rights separate and different from the rights of the Respondent.\n\n82.\n\n*Article 5:* Under Article 5.1, TexPet and its then parent company (Texaco) were expressly named as \"Releasees\" in the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal considers that the description of \"all\" the subsequent categories of unnamed Releasees was generally intended to be as broad as was then conceived to be possible, covering both all existing and future persons associated with TexPet who might conceivably be the subject of any environmental claim by the Respondent and PetroEcuador. That general intent, however, must yield to the specific contractual wording agreed by the signatory parties.\n\n83.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the crucial wording appears in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement: \"principales y subsidiarias\". The Parties' respective arguments have been summarised above, as also the conclusions reached by the Parties' respective expert witnesses. It is ultimately a short point, in the Tribunal's view; and it is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal here to belabour it unduly.\n\n84.\n\nIn brief, the Tribunal accepts the grammatical, contextual and common-sense approach to this wording proposed by the Claimants and their two expert witnesses, Dr Barros and Dr Coronel; and it does not accept the approach taken by the Respondent and its expert witness, Professor Salgado, based on the application of Ecuadorian law on agency. The Tribunal also considers that if the issue had arisen at the time the 1995 Settlement Agreement was being signed, both sides would have reacted similarly, to the effect that the wording \"principales y subsidiarias\" was an obvious shorthand term, requiring no additional wording, for \"las compa\u00f1\u00edas principales y subsidiarias\"; and that neither side would have suggested then that their chosen wording referred to a principal-agent relationship.\n\n85.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's interpretation, as now advanced in this arbitration, would have been and remains materially inapposite, ineffective and inconsistent under the rules for contractual interpretation under Ecuadorian law listed in Paragraph 63(iv)(a)-(d) above. Moreover, with such a general intention attributable to the signatory parties to compromise such extensive classes of claims against such broad categories of potential defendants, with Texaco expressly included as TexPet's existing parent, it would be an extreme oddity if the signatory parties had intended, without the clearest wording, to exclude a future parent of TexPet because any future parent of TexPet (after Texaco) was the most obvious potential defendant with the deepest pockets. The Tribunal decides that there is no such objective intention evident from the terms of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n86.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal decides that Chevron is a \"Releasee\" under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the Final Release. It follows from the Tribunal's decision that Chevron is contractually privy to the 1995 Settlement Agreement; in other words Chevron is \"party\", albeit not a signatory party such as TexPet.\n\n87.\n\n*Article 9.4:* The next issue of interpretation arises from Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, invoked by the Respondent. In the Tribunal's view, this issue raises also a short point of contractual interpretation. For ease of reference, the Tribunal here sets out the Spanish text of Article 9.4, with the two relevant phrases highlighted: \"No se deber\u00e1 inferir que este Contrato conferir\u00e1 beneficios *a terceros que no sean parte de este Contrato*, ni tampoco que proporcionar\u00e1 derechos *a terceros* para hacer cumplir sus provisiones\". (The Parties' rival English translations of this Spanish text are set out above in Part B, paragraph 27).\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the wording of Article 9.4 addresses \"third parties\" who are not parties or part of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That much is readily apparent from the first phrase in the Spanish version and indeed in both Parties' English disputed translations. The issue only arises from the second phrase in Article 9.4 which, so the Respondent contends, addresses more generally third parties, here including third parties which are also party to or part of the 1995 Settlement Agreement described in the first phrase of Article 9.4.\n\n89.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the second shorter phrase is intended as an abbreviated form of the first phrase. In other words, both phrases address third parties which are not party to or part of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal arrives at this interpretation as a matter of grammar, semantics and contextual consistency, but also, above all, as a matter of common sense and effectiveness under the rules for contractual interpretation under Ecuadorian law listed in Paragraph 63(iv)(a)-(d) above. It would make no sense whatever to attribute to the signatory parties a common intent to include a person as a Releasee with ostensible contractual rights under Article 5 but then to exclude that same person from any benefit to enforce those rights under Article 9.4. If such an absurd result had been intended by the signatory parties, it would take much clearer wording than is expressed in Article 9.4; and, in the Tribunal's view, such wording is significantly absent to establish any such intention.\n\n90.\n\n*Legal Ambiguity:* In the Tribunal's view, although highly disputed between the Parties at great length, the terms of Articles 1.12, 5.1, 5.2, 9.3 and 9.4 are ultimately not legally ambiguous under Ecuadorian law. The mere fact that the interpretation of a contractual term is disputed by parties and subjected to their exhaustive submissions and materials does not make it ambiguous. Accordingly the Tribunal does not invoke the rule of contractual interpretation relevant to ambiguity under Ecuadorian law listed in Paragraph 63(iv)(e) above, including Article 1582 of the Civil Code.13\n\nArticle 1582 of the Civil Code provides that, if none of its preceding rules of interpretation apply, ambiguous clauses shall be interpreted in a favour of the obligor. (In Spanish: \"*No pudiendo aplicarse ninguna de las reglas precedentes de interpretaci\u00f3n, se interpretar\u00e1n las cl\u00e1usulas ambiguas a favor del deudor. Pero las cl\u00e1usulas ambiguas que hayan sido extendidas o dictadas por una de las partes, sea acreedora o deudora, se interpretar\u00e1n contra ella, siempre que la ambig\u00fcedad provenga de la* *falta de una explicaci\u00f3n que haya debido darse por ella*\").\n\n91.\n\n*Decisions \u2013 Interpretation:* Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal decides that Chevron, as a party to and \"part of\" the 1995 Settlement Agreement, can enforce its contractual rights under Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as an unnamed Releasee (as also under Article IV of the Final Release), in the same way and to the same extent as TexPet as a signatory party and named Releasee. Moreover, the Tribunal decides that Chevron and TexPet can exercise those rights both defensively and offensively, as claimant or respondent in legal or arbitration proceedings seeking in both any appropriate relief under Ecuadorian law. In the Tribunal's view, nothing in the 1995 Settlement Agreement supports the contention that the manner in which those rights may be exercised is limited, as submitted by the Respondent.\n\n92.\n\n*II Introduction - Legal Effect:* The Tribunal has here experienced several problems in deciding in full the respective submissions made by the Parties as to the legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Quite apart from the Parties' attempts to introduce into Track I submissions already reserved for Track II, the Tribunal considers that other parts of the Parties' submissions overlap significantly with issues falling under Track II and that still other parts originally intended for Track I can now only be decided by the Tribunal with Track II, particularly in the light of the Parties' written pleadings in Track II (which are still incomplete as at the date of this Partial Award). As Counsel for the Respondent rightly cautioned the Tribunal in its closing oral submissions at the November Hearing, there could be a risk of procedural unfairness if the Tribunal decided too much under Track I when one or more Parties were still pleading their full cases in Track II, particularly the Respondent [D3,625-626].\n\n93.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal declines to decide in this Partial Award under Track I:\n\n(i) whether or not the Respondent has breached Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the Final Release; and, if so, precisely what remedies are available to Chevron and/or TexPet against the Respondent in respect of any such breach (i.e. damages, declaratory relief or specific performance); (ii) whether or not the claims pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs rest upon individual rights, as distinct from \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" rights (in whole or in part) and whether or not those claims are materially similar to the claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York; and (iii) the specific effect of any changes in Ecuadorian law taking place after the execution of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release, including the interpretation and application of the 1999 Environmental Management Act. These issues are hereby reserved to further decisions by the Tribunal in a later award; and none are decided by the Tribunal in this Partial Award.\n\n94.\n\n*(i) Analysis \u2013 Legal Effect:* Nonetheless, there are certain other issues which the Tribunal can here fairly decide as to the legal effect of its interpretation of Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as regards Chevron and the Respondent, as at the time of its execution by the signatory parties. (The positions of TexPet and PetroEcuador, whilst not ignored, can here be set aside for present purposes; and, as already indicated, no separate consideration is here required as regards Article IV of the 1998 Final Release).\n\n95.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal decides that the release granted to Chevron by the Respondent under Article 5 covers claims made by the Respondent (with or without PetroEcuador). As worded, the release does not extend to any claims made by third persons in respect of their own individual rights separate from the Respondent under Ecuadorian or other laws. In the Tribunal's view, this factor is not materially disputed by the Parties. The Claimants recognise that the release does not affect such individual rights, both for personal harm claimed by an individual and also the personal claims made by the identifiable Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York.\n\n96.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal decides that the release in Article 5 by the Respondent does not amount, from its own wording and under Ecuadorian law, to a settlement with a general \"erga omnes\" effect as res judicata upon any claims made by third persons in respect of their own individual rights separate from the Respondent under Ecuadorian or other laws. Under Ecuadorian law, in order to settle a claim, a person must have the ability to dispose of that claim; and the Respondent had no right to dispose of such an individual claim by a third person: Articles 2349 and 2354 of the Civil Code.14 This issue is different from and not to be confused with the next issue regarding the capacity of the Respondent in regard to \"diffuse\" or \"collective\" rights at the time of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\nArticle 2349 of the Civil Code provides that the only person who can settle a claim is the person who is able to dispose of the objects covered by the settlement (In Spanish: \"*No puede transigir sino la persona capaz de disponer de los objetos comprendidos en la transacci\u00f3n*\"). Article 2354 of the Civil Code provides that a settlement regarding the rights of others is not valid (In Spanish : \"*No vale la transacci\u00f3n sobre derechos ajenos o sobre derechos que no existen*\").\n\n97.\n\nThe words \"diffuse\" and collective\" do not appear in the 1995 Settlement Agreement. However, as recorded in Paragraph 63 above, the Parties' expert witnesses agree that the laws of Ecuador when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was executed are incorporated into the Settlement Agreement pursuant to Article 7, number eighteen, of the Civil Code.15 In their joint expert report dated 7 August 2012, Professors Le Chatelier and Oquendo agreed the following legal definition of diffuse rights: \"Diffuse rights are indivisible entitlements that pertain to the community as a whole, such as the community's collective right to live in a healthy and uncontaminated environment \u2026\". Although these two experts cite as references (inter alia) Ecuadorian laws subsequent to 1995 (including the 1999 Environmental Management Act), the Tribunal considers that this agreed definition is equally appropriate at the time when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was made as regards Ecuadorian law incorporated into the 1995 Settlement Agreement. For present purposes, the Tribunal sees no material distinction between the terms \"diffuse\" and \"collective\" rights, here preferring to use the former term only.\n\nArticle 7 of the Civil Code provides, in relevant part: \"*La ley no dispone sino para lo venidero: no tiene efecto retroactivo; y en conflicto de una ley posterior con otra anterior, se observar\u00e1n las reglas siguientes: \u2026. En todo contrato se entender\u00e1n incorporadas las leyes vigentes al tiempo de su celebraci\u00f3n*\".\n\n98.\n\n*(ii) Article 19-2:* This issue of diffuse rights concerns, above all, the nature of the legal rights expressed in Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution in force when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was made by the signatory parties. That constitutional provision is expressly cited in Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as well as incorporated under Ecuadorian rules of contractual interpretation (for its relevant Spanish text and English translation, see Part B above).\n\n99.\n\nAlthough Article 19-2 is not framed in terms that explicitly confer any right of action, it is common ground between the Parties that it did confer a right to a pollution-free environment guaranteed by \"the State\". Constitutionally, the \"State\" in Article 19-2 is of course the Respondent. Although there is no record (as at 1995) of the Respondent ever itself resorting to legal proceedings to make an environmental claim against any person pursuant to Article 19-2, it is clear from the wording of Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement that such a possibility was objectively considered to exist by its signatory parties (including the Respondent), however remote the likelihood of it occurring in practice. Moreover, the Respondent's expert witness, Professor Eguiguren, acknowledged in his oral testimony at the November Hearing that the Respondent could make such a claim in 1995 [D1,208-209]. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that Article 5 was intended to preclude the Respondent from itself making any claim against a Releasee (now including Chevron) under Article 19-2 of the Constitution (or its subsequent constitutional equivalent).\n\n100.\n\nOn the other hand, as decided above, the contractual wording also records an intention by the signatory parties not to affect claims made separately by other third persons with their own individual rights; nor could it affect those separate third-person rights as a matter of Ecuadorian law: see Article 2363 of the Civil Code.16 The Tribunal therefore concludes that, as at 1995, such an individual claiming damages for personal harm remained free to do so, notwithstanding the Respondent's release in Article 5, even where that person invoked Article 19-2 of the Constitution in support of an individual claim for damages in respect of personal harm (actual or threatened) separate from the Respondent. The Tribunal notes the decision in the Guti\u00e9rrez case of 29 September 1993 where the individual plaintiff was awarded damages against the defendant pig farmer for personal harm to him, his wife and their property based (inter alia) upon a claim under Article 19-2 of the Constitution.17\n\nArticle 2363 of the Civil Code provides that a settlement shall only be effective as between the parties to such settlement (In Spanish: \"*La transacci\u00f3n no surte efecto sino entre los contratantes. Si son muchos los principales interesados en el negocio sobre el cual se transige, la transacci\u00f3n consentida por uno de ellos, no perjudica ni aprovecha los otros; salvo, empero, los efectos de la* *novaci\u00f3n, en el caso de solidaridad*\"). Article 297 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires the common identity of (i) parties, (ii) causa petendi (as to facts and legal basis); and (iii) object.\n\nThe Angel Guti\u00e9rrez case of 29 September 1993 (ibid)\n\n101.\n\nHowever, the issue is not whether such an individual could make such a claim in respect of his or her personal harm, but rather whether such an individual could make a claim in respect of harm arising out of the alleged violation of a diffuse right under Article 19-2 of the Constitution without claiming to have suffered any personal harm. The Tribunal considers that, as at 1995, such a claim by such an individual was not possible under Ecuadorian law, that cause of action being confined under Article 19-2 to the Respondent alone. It is here helpful to set out the rival approaches taken by the Parties' respective expert witnesses, as largely recorded in their joint expert report dated 7 August 2012.\n\n102.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants' experts (Dr Barros, Dr Coronel, Professor Oquendo and Dr Romero) testified that the constitutional right under Article 19-2 was a diffuse and indivisible right because the owner of that right was the entire community of Ecuadorian citizens (not individuals or groups of individuals); the Ecuadorian Government asserted this right for the benefit of the entire community of Ecuadorian citizens in the 1995 Settlement Agreement, in the exercise of the Respondent's duty to vindicate the right of its citizens to live in an environment free from contamination and to foster the preservation of nature; and, accordingly, the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with the Final Release) extinguished any possible environmental claim against the Releasees arising from the alleged violation of this diffuse right under Article 19-2, whether made by the Respondent or any third person.\n\n103.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent's expert witnesses (Professor Eguiguren, supported by Professor Le Chatelier), whilst acknowledging that a diffuse right was indivisible, testified that, in order to settle any right, the settling party must have the capacity to dispose of that right under Ecuadorian law; the Ecuadorian Government acted in the 1995 Settlement Agreement to settle only its own rights arising from the 1973 Concession Agreement; the Government did not have any capacity: (i) to dispose of the rights of individuals or (ii) to represent individuals for the purpose of settling in their name rights conferred upon them by Ecuadorian law, including rights under Article 19-2 of the Constitution; and for this purpose the nature of the right is irrelevant (i.e. whether diffuse or otherwise) because a settlement, according to Ecuadorian law, can affect only the parties to that settlement and cannot affect the rights of third persons.\n\n104.\n\nAs already noted above, the first of these propositions concerning \u2018individual' rights is common ground between the Parties' expert witnesses and is not disputed by the Claimants. It is the second proposition concerning Article 19-2 which divides the Parties' expert witnesses.\n\n105.\n\nFrom the materials adduced by the Parties and their expert witnesses in these arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal concludes that the diffuse and indivisible right under Article 19-2 of the Constitution was the same before and after the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In particular, Professor Eguiguren testified at the November Hearing that \"\u2026 the right remains the same. The right to live in a healthy environment is the same of [in] 1995. In reality, since 1983, when it was introduced in the Ecuadorian Constitution, it's the same of [in] 1998 and 2008 \u2026.\" [D1,199]. What changed under Ecuadorian law after 1995 was the legal standing of a private individual to bring a claim under Article 19-2 asserting a diffuse constitutional right (not being a claim in respect of that individual's personal harm). That new legal standing was subsequently confirmed by the 1999 Environmental Management Act.\n\n106.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, under Ecuadorian law as at the time when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was executed (i.e. before the 1999 Act), only the Respondent could bring a diffuse claim under Article 19-2 to safeguard the right of citizens to live in an environment free from contamination. At that time, no other person could bring such a claim. No instance of the Respondent bringing or settling such a claim (other than this case) and no decisive provision of Ecuadorian law was brought to the attention of the Tribunal. Nonetheless, it must follow from the circumstances prevailing in 1995 that the Respondent, and only the Respondent, had the legal capacity to make and settle a diffuse claim under Article 19-2. If the Respondent could not make and then settle a diffuse claim under Article 19-2, no-one else could. The Tribunal is therefore persuaded by the analysis submitted by the Claimants' expert witnesses on this point, namely that in 1995 the Respondent (acting by its Government) could settle a diffuse claim under Article 19-2 \"forever\" against the Releasees; and that accordingly no such diffuse claim could be made in the future against any Releasee.\n\n107.\n\nAfter 1995, the Tribunal considers that the same situation prevailed: the right to make an environmental claim based upon the diffuse right under Article 19-2 against the Releasees remained settled \"forever\". The new factor, confirmed by the 1999 Environmental Management Act, that one or more private individuals now had standing to bring a claim asserting diffuse rights could not revive the diffuse right under Article 19-2 which had already been extinguished by the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It is not juridically possible for a person to exercise a right which no longer exists, even if, were that right to remain in existence, that person has newly acquired the right to exercise it. As agreed by the Parties' experts, that diffuse right under Article 19-2 was \"indivisible\": it was either settled in full or not at all. The Tribunal has rejected the latter possibility; and it decides upon the former. It rejects entirely the third possibility that the same diffuse right in Article 19-2 can exist in separate parts, to be exercised by multiple claimants at different times with successive diffuse claims, thereby making any effective final settlement or adjudication of such claims illusory.\n\n108.\n\n*(iii) Decisions - Legal Effect:* Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that, under Ecuadorian law, Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the Final Release preclude any claim by the Respondent against any Releasee invoking the diffuse constitutional right under Article 19-2 of the Constitution, but that these releases also preclude any third person making a claim against a Releasee invoking the same diffuse constitutional right under Article 19-2, not being a separate and different claim for personal harm (whether actual or threatened).\n\n109.\n\nIt will be noted that the Tribunal has not considered the other statutory provisions listed in Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, particularly the Decree No. 374, the Water Act of 1973 and Decree No. 2144. The Tribunal has heard much less about these provisions so far; and it is therefore reluctant to make any final decisions in their regard before satisfying itself that there are no material differences between the nature of the legal rights under these provisions and the rights under Article 19-2. The Tribunal will if necessary request further submissions from the Parties on this point.\n\n110.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal has not here decided the nature and scope of popular actions under Articles 990 and 2236 of the Civil Code. From the Parties' expert witness reports, there appears to be common ground that a claimant could not bring any environmental claim as a popular action without (inter alia) claiming actual or threatened personal harm. The Tribunal has again heard much less about these popular actions (both before and after the 1995 Settlement Agreement); and, whilst it seems at present that these actions are unlikely to be decisive one way or the other in this case, the Tribunal again prefers to defer its decision for the time being. Similarly, the Tribunal will if necessary request further submissions from the Parties on these popular actions.\n\n***PART E: THE OPERATIVE PART***\n--------------------------------\n\n111.\n\n**This Partial Award, although separately signed by the Tribunal's members on three signing pages, constitutes a \"Partial Award\" signed by the three arbitrators under Article 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.**\n\n112.\n\n**For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finally decides and awards as follows in Track I of these arbitration proceedings:**\n\n**(1) The First Claimant (\"Chevron\") and the Second Claimant (\"TexPet\") are both \"Releasees\" under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release;**\n\n**(2) As such a Releasee, a party to and also part of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the First Claimant can invoke its contractual rights thereunder in regard to the release in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release as fully as the Second Claimant as a signatory party and named Releasee;**\n\n**(3) The scope of the releases in Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release made by the Respondent to the First and Second Claimants does not extend to any environmental claim made by an individual for personal harm in respect of that individual's rights separate and different from the Respondent; but it does have legal effect under Ecuadorian law precluding any \"diffuse\" claim against the First and Second Claimants under Article 19-2 of the Constitution made by the Respondent and also made by any individual not claiming personal harm (actual or threatened); and**\n\n**(4) Save as aforesaid, the Tribunal does not here decide (one way or the other) any part of the formal relief claimed by the Parties respectively in regard to Track I, reserving to itself its full powers and discretion to do so in one or more later awards.**\n\n***APPENDIX 1***\n\n***THE 1995 Settlement Agreement (Spanish original version)***\n\n**CONTRATO PARA LA EJECUCION DE TRABAJOS DE REPARACION MEDIOAMBIENTAL Y**\n\n**LIBERACION DE OBLIGACIONES, RESPONSABILIDADES Y DEMANDAS**\n\n**ESTE CONTRATO para la Ejecuci\u00f3n de Trabajos de Reparaci\u00f3n Ambiental** ***y*** **Liberaci\u00f3n**  **de**  **Obligaciones.

I am equally aware that the Decision in principle distances itself from any specific or technical analysis under Ecuadorian law of the questions subject to the Decision and indicates that it considers such questions strictly from the perspective of an international tribunal under the Ecuador-U.S.A. Treaty for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment.\n\n3.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Decision advances in its paragraphs 183 and 186, however interim or preliminary, substantive determinations of issues at the center of the Parties\u2019 disputes. Even on such interim or preliminary bases, I am unable to agree at the present juncture that such determinations are supported by the reasons given for them in the Decision and, therefore, I must dissent. Necessarily, this dissent cannot be of more definitive nature than the Decision, nor may address legal and factual issues exceeding the self-imposed limits of the Decision, although part of the problem is indeed that the Decision prematurely advances determinations concerning crucial matters after circumscribing the legal and factual elements to be considered to such effect and limiting the analysis to the Complaint. However, at this stage, since it obviously cannot go beyond the self-traced boundaries of the Decision itself, this Note of Dissent shares the Decision\u2019s interim nature, and is made from the perspective of an international arbitral tribunal without, as the Decision states (paras. 157-158), being bound by any legal technicalities inherent to any applicable law, including Ecuadorian law.\n\n4.\n\nDespite the above *caveat,* since the Respondent has laid great emphasis in support of its position regarding the questions addressed by the Decision on the Delfina Ecuadorian Supreme Court decision (\"Delfina\"), and also with the intention of unraveling the ambiguities under Ecuadorian law posed by the matters to be resolved (Decision, para. 166), the Decision rightly refers to Delfina at length (Decision\u2019s paras. 173-174). According to Delfina, an individual claim is a claim requesting relief for harm individually suffered in the form of pecuniary compensation or reparation in kind of such specific harm, and irrespective of whether such claimant is a physical person or a legal entity.\n\n5.\n\nDelfina concerned an individual claim by the *\"Comit\u00e9 Delfina Torres Vda. De Concha\"* legal entity characterized as a *persona jur\u00eddica, corporaci\u00f3n de derecho privado1,* which was set forth by its legal representative. This legal entity was awarded economic compensation amounting to US$ 11,000,000.00 that it chose (as it was its right absent any valid opposition raised by the respondent and accepted by a court of law) to transform into a reparation in kind. As decided by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court the reparation in kind was anyway not to exceed the amount of US$ 11,000,000.00 of the entity\u2019s pecuniary claim as awarded by the Supreme Court (initially, the entity sought compensation amounting to US$ 35,000,000.002). It should then be concluded that such relief remains an individual relief even if it has the parallel or side effect of benefiting third parties including, in the case of a legal entity, persons comprised or not by it.\n\nDelfina, *TERCERO,* at 2 (Spanish original).\n\nDelfina complaint (Exhibit R-l 188).\n\n6.\n\nAs the Decision properly emphasizes, attention should be paid to the substance and not merely to the form of pleadings to elucidate the nature of the claims contained in the Complaint (para. 158). This approach is pertinent when looking at the Complaint against the backdrop of Delfina. However, following such approach raises the always difficult -and often debated - issue of the dividing line between a substantive claim and the corresponding remedy. In this connection, not infrequently the conclusion is that substance and remedy indissolubly go together, and that the latter may fashion the former.\n\n7.\n\nSuch is the case of the Complaint. Nothing in the Complaint (as summarized in part in paras. 159-164 of the Decision) shows that it seeks individual relief in the sense understood in Delfina. None of the claims in the Complaint identifies a person or entity (including the persons formulating the Complaint) claiming compensation (pecuniary or in kind) specifically remedying the damage suffered by any such person or his or her property. Even if Delfina were not used as a yardstick, how can a claim seeking relief benefitting entire communities be equated as to its substance, effects and possibly economic dimension, with claims seeking particularized relief for the discrete harm individually proven and suffered by each claimant? In order to be consistent with the concern of privileging substance over form, the merely formal aspects of the formulation of the Complaint (e.g., coincidence of the persons making the Complaint and the Aguinda U.S. complaint and the fact that the same attorney represented the complainants in both cases, referred to in para. 165 of the Decision) cannot be privileged over the characteristics of the claims under the Complaint which, as indicated above, in their substance are not individual claims.\n\n8.\n\nIndeed, rather than supporting the characterization of the Complaint as an individual claim or individual claims, by suggesting that Article 23 (27) of the Ecuadorian Constitution3 may allow claims on behalf of *third parties determined or undetermined4,* Delfina appears to place the discussion and the issues to be decided on the plane the Parties themselves seem to have now placed them: rather than as a differentiation between \"individual\" and \"diffuse\" claims, as a differentiation between \"collective\" claims (as pleaded by the Respondent) and \"diffuse\" claims (as pleaded by the Claimants) or, as also pleaded by the Claimants, as claims that, irrespective of their\n\nThis provision includes within the civil rights granted to any Ecuadorian *\"el derecho al debido proceso y a una justicia sin dilaciones\"* (the rights to due process and prompt access to justice [my informal translation]).\n\nDelfina, page 5 (Spanish), referring to \".....*toda clase de pretensiones, fundada o infundadamente, para s\u00ed o para terceros determinados o indeterminados...\"* characterization as \"collective\" or \"diffuse\", do not show any meaningful difference for the purpose of deciding the issues before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nFor the above reasons, I respectfully disagree with the Decision and its conclusions, including that the Complaint does not fall within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, consider that it is premature to address in any way at the present stage, on the basis of a limited record, and without simultaneously taking into account the circumstances mentioned in paras. 140-142 of the Decision, whether the Lago Agrio claims are or are not covered by the 1995 Settlement Agreement, and further also consider that the issues raised by the nature or characterization of the Lago Agrio claims and whether they are encompassed or not by the 1995 Settlement Agreement require being addressed in Track 2 of this arbitration in the light of the Parties\u2019 pleadings as to the \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" nature of such claims and the factors alluded to in the Decision\u2019s paras. 140-142.\n\n12 March 2015."}], "Content": "Decision on Track 1B\n--------------------\n\n***PART A: PREFACE***\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy this decision in Track 1B of this arbitration, the Tribunal addresses a further part of the Parties' dispute concerning the legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with the 1998 Final Release) made between the Second Claimant (\"TexPet\") and the Respondent as signatories, under which both TexPet and the First Claimant (\"Chevron\") were \"Releasees\" as decided by the Tribunal in its First Partial Award dated 17 September 2013 (the \"First Partial Award\").\n\n2.\n\nThis decision should be read with the First Partial Award, together with all other orders and interim awards made earlier by the Tribunal. It is thus unnecessary to repeat much of what is already there fully recorded and already well known to the Parties in this arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal makes this decision in order to take further, as best it can in current circumstances, certain matters which were deliberately not decided in the First Partial Award, as being then premature for final decision by the Tribunal in the form of an award. The Tribunal refers, in particular, to Paragraph 93 of the First Partial Award (page 38) where the Tribunal left undecided whether or not the claims originally pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in Ecuador rested upon individual rights, as distinct from diffuse rights (in whole or in part); and whether or not those claims were materially similar to the claims previously made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York, before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\n4.\n\nThere were several other matters left undecided in the First Partial Award as being then also premature. The Tribunal considers that it still cannot decide these matters until a later stage of these arbitration proceedings, namely by one or more orders, decisions and awards in Track 2 of this arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nIt has become increasingly clear during this arbitration that the Claimants' principal claim under the USA-Ecuador BIT is made against the Respondent for multiple denials of justice within the Ecuadorian legal system (being allegedly attributable to the Respondent under international law), not limited to the Lago Agrio Court but extending also independently to the appellate courts of Ecuador, namely the Appellate Court of Lago Agrio and the National Court of Ecuador on Cassation (the \"Cassation Court\").1 The Respondent strongly denies all claims for denial of justice on the merits and also disputes the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide any such claims in this arbitration. Those parts of the Parties' dispute (both merits and jurisdiction) have been reserved for Track 2 and cannot be decided, even indirectly, by the Tribunal in this Track 1B. In these circumstances, as further explained below, the Tribunal has decided that it cannot yet address, fairly or properly, the conduct of the Ecuadorian Courts in deciding the claims originally pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.\n\nBefore the April Hearing, the Claimants had already impugned the judgments of the Lago Agrio Court and the Appellate Court; and during the April Hearing, the Claimants likewise impugned the recent judgment of the Cassation Court: see their Opening PP Slides Nos 15 & 124. Their case on denial of justice was further confirmed by the Claimants' Reply Memorial dated 14 January 2015, paragraph 13 (page 7): \"Perhaps most egregiously, the Ecuadorian appellate courts refused to even address Chevron's fraud and corruption evidence - itself a freestanding denial of justice.\" See also paragraphs 275-278 (pages 147-150), alleging against these appellate courts denials of justice per se and independent violations of the \"effective means\" and \"fair and equitable treatment\" provisions of the USA-Ecuador BIT.\n\n6.\n\nFor reasons also explained below, this decision is not to be regarded as an award; and it is not intended to give rise to any issue estoppel or any form of res judicata. Accordingly, the Tribunal retains in full its jurisdiction to re-visit any part of this decision at a later stage of this arbitration by one or more orders, decisions and awards, without having become *functus officio* as regards any issue addressed by this decision. It is also subject to the Tribunal's procedural orders to be made on several of the Parties' procedural applications during Track 1.\n\n***PART B: TRACK 1B OF THE ARBITRATION***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n7.\n\nGiven that this decision follows five prior awards already made in these arbitration proceedings, it is unnecessary to re-state the formal parts of these earlier decisions or to repeat the procedural history of these arbitration proceedings. For simplicity's sake, the Tribunal hereby incorporates by reference Part I of its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Part A of its First Partial Award on Track 1; and it here includes only a summary of the major procedural steps and events following the Tribunal's First Partial Award on Track 1 on 17 September 2013 (the \"First Partial Award\"), which concern both Track 1B and Track 2 of this arbitration.\n\n***(2) Procedure 2013-2015***\n-----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nFollowing the decisions taken in its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award on Track 1 on 17 September 2013. An original of the award was deposited with the Hague District Court on 7 October 2013 in accordance with the requirements of the Netherlands Arbitration Act (as the lex loci arbitri).\n\n9.\n\nOn 10 October 2013, in response to an application by the Respondent, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 in which the Tribunal ordered the Claimants to use their best endeavours to facilitate the deposition by the Respondent of Mr Guerra.\n\n10.\n\nOn 11 November 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 20 and No. 21. In its Procedural Order No. 20, the Tribunal denied the Claimants' application for an order requiring the Respondent to produce to the Claimants a full copy of the expert report prepared by Messrs Jaque Tarco and Julio Simba Chuquimarca regarding the forensic analysis of Mr Zambrano's computers in connection with criminal investigations in Ecuador. In its Procedural Order No. 21, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that all relevant remaining issues requiring a final decision by the Tribunal, except for those relating to quantum deferred to Track 3, would be heard at the Track 2 Hearing, then scheduled for January 2014. At the same time, the Tribunal invited the Parties to propose a schedule for supplemental written submissions on the remaining Track 1 issues, including those issues described in Paragraph 93 of the Tribunal's First Partial Award and how (if at all) the Tribunal's decisions in the First Partial Award affected the Parties' respective cases under Track 2.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 November 2013, the National Court of Justice of Ecuador (the \"Cassation Court\") issued its judgment on Chevron's cassation appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court of Lago Agrio.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 14 November 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the judgment of the Cassation Court and requested that, as a result of that judgment, the Tribunal (i) rescind the deadline for the submission of the Respondent's Track 2 Rejoinder, (ii) vacate the Track 2 Hearing scheduled for January 2014 and (iii) establish a new timetable for written submissions on the effects of the judgment of the Cassation Court.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 November 2013, following several exchanges with the Parties, the Tribunal suspended the deadline for the submission of the Respondent's Track 2 Rejoinder and convened a procedural meeting with the Parties. It was held (by telephone conference-call) on 3 December 2013.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing that procedural meeting, on 5 December 2013 the Tribunal issued an urgent procedural order whereby the Tribunal decided that the Respondent's Track 2 Rejoinder, to be submitted by a new deadline of 16 December 2013, would be limited to responding to the factual basis alleged by the Claimants for their claims for denial of justice and need not there address any legal issues arising from the recent judgment of the Cassation Court. The Tribunal also decided that the scope of issues to be addressed at the Track 2 Hearing scheduled for January 2014 would be similarly limited, with a further Hearing scheduled for 14-18 April 2014 to address new issues arising from the judgment of the Cassation Court (with a timetable for further written submissions on these new issues to be established in further consultations with the Parties).\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 13 December 2013, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider its procedural order of 5 December 2013, which the Claimants opposed. The Tribunal did not accede to the Respondent's request.\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the Respondent submitted its Track 2 Rejoinder.\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 December 2013, the Claimants submitted a substantial number of new \"Pre-Hearing Exhibits\" in response to the Respondent's Rejoinder.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 29 December 2013, the Respondent objected to the unsolicited and untimely introduction of the Claimants' new exhibits. The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal vacate the January 2014 oral hearing on Track 2 and convene a procedural meeting in its place in order to establish a different timetable for the arbitration, which the Claimants opposed.\n\n19.\n\nOn 2 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 whereby it vacated the January 2014 oral hearing on Track 2 and convened a procedural meeting in its place in order to establish a new procedural timetable for the arbitration.\n\n20.\n\nOn 20-21 January 2014, this procedural meeting was held at the World Bank in Washington DC, USA in order to address all pending procedural matters and establish a new procedural timetable for the arbitration.\n\n21.\n\nOn 31 January 2014, as directed by the Tribunal during this January 2014 procedural meeting, the Claimants submitted a Supplemental Memorial on Track 1.\n\n22.\n\nOn 10 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 23 in which it set out a new procedural timetable for the arbitration. The order identified certain issues arising out of the Tribunal's Partial Award on Track 1 and the judgment of the Cassation Court to be addressed, to the extent appropriate, in a new \"Track 1B\", as well as issues to be reserved later for Tracks 2 and 3. A timetable for the Parties' submissions on Track 1B was established, culminating in a hearing to be held on 28 to 30 April 2014. A new timetable for Track 2 was also established, to culminate in a hearing to be held on 20 April to 8 May 2015.\n\n23.\n\nOn 13 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 24, clarifying the scope of issues to be dealt with in Track 1B in response to a disagreement between the Parties.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 25 whereby it decided certain document production requests made by the Respondent.\n\n25.\n\nOn 31 March 2014, the Respondent submitted its Supplemental CounterMemorial on Track 1B.\n\n26.\n\nOn 1 April 2014, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting with the Parties (by telephone conference-call) in preparation for the Track 1B hearing and to address various outstanding procedural applications.\n\n27.\n\nOn 28-29 April 2014, the hearing on Track 1B was held in Washington DC, USA (the \"April Hearing\"). At this stage, the Parties' cases on issues under Track 1B were completed. It is nonetheless necessary to describe the further procedural steps which followed the April Hearing, given their effect on the scope and timing of this decision.\n\n28.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, the Claimants submitted their Supplemental Memorial on Track 2.\n\n29.\n\nOn 12 May 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 26 whereby it granted the Claimants' application for an order permitting a forensic inspection of the two computers that Mr Zambrano used while acting as an Ecuadorian judge in the Lago Agrio Litigation, such inspection to take place in accordance with a written protocol agreed between the Parties and appended to the order. The order also appointed Ms Kathryn Owen as an expert to the Tribunal (in accordance with Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) to attend the inspection and make an independent image of the computers' hard drives as stipulated in the protocol.\n\n30.\n\nOn 20 and 21 May 2014, the inspection of Mr Zambrano's computers (pursuant to foreseen Procedural Order No. 26) was conducted in Quito, Ecuador between the representatives of the Parties, their designated experts, the Tribunal's expert (Ms Owen), and the Secretary to the Tribunal (Mr Doe). Following the inspection in Quito, on 28 May 2014 the Tribunal issued a revised written protocol under Procedural Order No. 26 which confirmed certain changes agreed on-site during the inspection of Mr Zambrano's computers and also included completed expert certifications and documentation on the chain of custody.\n\n31.\n\nOn 12 June 2014, the Tribunal circulated its Draft Procedural Order No. 27 concerning the Respondent's application for a site-visit to the former TexPet concession area. On 13 August 2014, following a procedural meeting held with the Parties (by telephone conference-call) on 9 July 2014 and various further exchanges regarding the Respondent's application for a site-visit, the Tribunal issued a Revised Draft Procedural Order No. 27 in which the Tribunal indicated that it had decided, in principle, in favour of a site-visit before or after the Track 2 Hearing (as requested by the Respondent, but opposed by the Claimants).\n\n32.\n\nHowever, significant disagreements between the Parties in respect of several procedural and logistical matters regarding the site-visit, combined with other matters, made it impossible for the Tribunal to complete plans for a site-visit prior the Track 2 Hearing, namely in November 2014. The Tribunal agreed to continue discussing the organisation of a site-visit after the Track 2 Hearing.\n\n33.\n\nOn 4 September 2014, in response to an application by the Respondent for the Tribunal to reconsider its decision made in its revised draft Procedural Order No. 27, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 28 in which it confirmed the material decisions set out in its revised draft Procedural Order No. 27.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 19 September 2014, the Respondent requested all three members of the Tribunal to recuse themselves without delay from this arbitration. The Respondent's request was opposed by the Claimants, by letter dated 29 September 2014. Having considered both letters and attached materials from the Parties, by message dated 30 September 2014, each of the three members of the Tribunal declined the Respondent's request to recuse themselves from this arbitration.\n\n35.\n\nBy written Notice of Challenge dated 24 October 2014, pursuant to Articles 10 and 13 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the Netherlands Arbitration Act, the Respondent requested the Permanent Court of Arbitration to recuse all three members of the Tribunal. The challenge was opposed by the Claimants, by a written Response dated 31 October 2014. The Respondent's challenge was rejected in respect of all three members of the Tribunal by a written decision of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (issued in his capacity as appointing authority) on 21 November 2014.\n\n36.\n\nOn 7 November 2014, the Respondent submitted its Supplemental CounterMemorial on Track 2.\n\n37.\n\nOn 8 and 22 December 2014, the Tribunal held two further procedural meetings with the Parties (by telephone conference-call) in regard to the site-visit and other matters.\n\n38.\n\nOn 4 January 2015, the Tribunal indicated its interim decisions on certain issues between the Parties in regard to the site-visit.\n\n39.\n\nOn 14 January 2015, the Claimants submitted their Supplemental Track 2 Reply Memorial.\n\n***(3) Written Pleadings***\n---------------------------\n\n40.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's procedural orders, the Parties submitted the following written pleadings specifically relevant to Track 1B:\n\n(i) The Claimants' Supplemental Memorial on Track 1B dated 31 January 2014;\n\n(ii) The Respondent's Supplemental Counter-Memorial on Track 1B dated 31 March 2014;\n\n(iii) The Parties' respective pre-hearing skeleton arguments submitted for the April Hearing.\n\n41.\n\nIn addition, parts of the following written pleadings were relevant to Track 1B: the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits dated 6 September 2010; the Claimants' Supplemental Memorial on the Merits dated 20 March 2012; the Respondent's Track 1 Counter-Memorial on the Merits dated 3 July 2012; the Claimants' Track 1 Reply Memorial on the Merits dated 29 August 2012; and the Respondent's Track 1 Rejoinder on the Merits dated 26 October 2012.\n\n42.\n\nWhilst the Parties made other substantive submissions during these proceedings touching upon issues in Track 1B, the Tribunal considers that their respective written cases for Track 1B can fairly be taken for present purposes from the pleadings and skeleton arguments listed above, together with their submissions made at the April Hearing.\n\n***(4) Written Testimony***\n---------------------------\n\n43.\n\nWhile the Claimant did not submit any additional written testimony relevant to Track 1B, the Respondent submitted the expert report of Professor Dr Jan M. van Dunn\u00e9 dated 27 March 2014. The Parties relied on the written and oral testimony already submitted by them respectively earlier during Track 1.\n\n44.\n\nFor the Claimants, this included the following written testimony:\n\n(i) The first expert report of Dr Enrique Barros (undated);\n\n(ii) The first expert report of Dr C\u00e9sar Coronel Jones dated 6 September 2010;\n\n(iii) The first expert report of Professor \u00c1ngel R. Oquendo dated 2 September 2010;\n\n(iv) The first expert report of Dr Gustavo Romero Ponce dated 3 September 2010;\n\n(v) The second expert report of Dr Enrique Barros dated 27 August 2012;\n\n(vi) The second expert report of Professor \u00c1ngel R. Oquendo dated 28 August 2012;\n\n(vii) The second expert report of Dr Gustavo Romero Ponce dated 27 August 2012; and\n\n(viii) The second expert report of Dr C\u00e9sar Coronel Jones dated 28 August 2010.\n\n45.\n\nFor the Respondent, this included the following written testimony:\n\n(i) The first expert report of Professor Genaro Eguiguren dated 2 July 2012;\n\n(ii) The second expert report of Professor Genaro Eguiguren dated 26 October 2012;\n\n(iii) The second expert report of Dr Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez dated 18 February 2013; and\n\n(iv) The third expert report of Professor Genaro Eguiguren dated 26 October 2012.\n\n***(5) The April Hearing***\n---------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe issues under Track 1B were argued by the Parties before the Tribunal at the hearing at the World Bank in Washington DC held over two days from 28 to 29 April 2014, with the assistance of English and Spanish interpreters and recorded in the form of both English and Spanish transcripts. The references below are made to the English version of the April Hearing's verbatim transcript, as follows: D1.10 signifies the first day, at page 10.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent were represented respectively at the April Hearing by those persons listed in the verbatim transcript, as follows.\n\n48.\n\nFor the Claimants, Mr Hewitt Pate, Mr Jose Martin, Mr Andres Romero, Ms Tanya Valli, Mr Todd Patty and Mr Herbert Stern (all of Chevron Corporation); Mr R.

Those submissions are briefly summarised below for the purpose of this decision. The omission here or later of any express reference to any part of the Parties' respective cases should not be taken, by itself, as signifying that it has not been considered by the Tribunal in its deliberations preceding this decision.\n\n54.\n\nThe brief summaries of the Parties' cases set out below are made from the Parties' written pleadings filed for Track 1B (listed above), their skeleton written arguments submitted shortly before the April Hearing (also listed above) and their oral submissions at the April Hearing (as recorded in the verbatim transcript, English version).\n\n***(2) The Claimants' Case***\n-----------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants contend that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs asserted only diffuse rights and therefore, in accordance with Paragraph 108 of the First Partial Award, that such claims were forever precluded by Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement with Article IV of the Final Release (collectively called \"the 1995 Settlement Agreement\").2\n\nParagraph 108 of the First Partial Award (pp. 43-44): *\"Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal* *concludes that, under Ecuadorian law, Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of* *the Final Release preclude any claim by the Respondent against any Releasee invoking the diffuse* *constitutional right under Article 19-2 of the Constitution, but that these releases also preclude any* *third person making a claim against a Releasee invoking the same diffuse constitutional right under* *Article 19-2, not being a separate and different claim for personal harm (whether actual or* *threatened).\"*\n\n56.\n\n*The Lago Agrio Litigation:* The Claimants submit that the Respondent, through the acts and omissions of its executive and judiciary (inter alia) in allowing the Lago Agrio case to proceed and in promoting the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, has breached the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It is also asserted by the Claimants that the Respondent, by its failure to honour its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, has breached the USA-Ecuador BIT; and that the Claimants are consequently entitled to the declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief claimed in this arbitration under the BIT.\n\n57.\n\nAs to the characterisation of the case advanced by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the Claimants submit that both the Lago Agrio Complaint and the Lago Agrio Judgment contain all the attributes of diffuse claims and none of the attributes of individual claims.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Tribunal, in its First Partial Award, adopted the definition of diffuse rights agreed in the joint report of Professors Le Chatelier and Oquendo; namely: \"Diffuse rights are indivisible entitlements that pertain to the community as a whole\". The Claimants further rely on the characteristics of a diffuse right identified by Professor Oquendo and Dr Barros in their first expert report, namely that: (i) it is an indivisible right that belongs to a community of indeterminate people; (ii) it is represented by an agent of the community, although the community is the party in interest in respect of any claim; (iii) the remedy is indivisible; and (iv) any judgment will have *res judicata erga omnes* effect.\n\n59.\n\nBy contrast, Professor Oquendo and Dr Barros identified the following characteristics of an individual right claimed by a plaintiff: (i) that right belongs to an individual and, under Ecuadorian law, no one can represent the rights of others without written authorisation; (ii) there is a causal link between the defendant's specific conduct and the harm done to the person or property of the individual; and (iii) the remedy is individual reparation.\n\n60.\n\n*Diffuse Claim:* The Claimants' case is that, when these characteristics are applied to the Lago Agrio claim and decisions of the Ecuadorian Courts, it is clear that the case was brought and decided to protect diffuse and not individual rights. The Claimants highlight the following principal matters:\n\n61.\n\nFirst, the Lago Agrio Complaint alleges that TexPet's conduct has caused harm to the environment rather than to any specific individual or their property. Similarly, the remedy sought is compensation for general remediation and public health. It is requested that any compensation be paid to and controlled by the \"Amazon Defense Front\". Furthermore a 10% bounty is sought, the purpose of which is to reward plaintiffs who seek remedies on behalf of the community.\n\n62.\n\nSecond, the 48 named Lago Agrio Plaintiffs did not have written authorisations to represent the other 30,000 or so members of the community invoked by them. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs pleaded that they were acting \"in our capacity as members of the affected communities and in safeguard of their recognised collective rights\", which (so the Claimants maintain) is inconsistent with the assertion of individual rights.\n\n63.\n\nThird, the Lago Agrio Judgment decided that: \"Proof has not been presented of the existence of harm to the health of specific persons\". The Claimants submit that the lack of any finding as to causation is inconsistent with the assertion of individual rights.\n\n64.\n\nFourth, the Clarification Order by the Lago Agrio Court confirmed that: \"... the complaint was signed by a group of individuals, the plaintiffs, but they are not suing on their own behalf. Rather they are suing on behalf of thousands who say they have been affected by the existence of environmental damage.\" The Clarification Order further explained that reference to \"damage\" in the Lago Agrio Judgment was to damage to the culture and health of the community and not personal damage to individuals.\n\n65.\n\nFifth, the subsequent decision of the Cassation Court emphasised that: \"The Environmental Management Act has foreseen these so-called popular-action lawsuits with regard to the environment and having to do with diffuse rights, under which rule this complaint has been filed.\"\n\n66.\n\nSixth, under Ecuadorian law, collective rights and diffuse rights are regarded as the same. The Constitutional Court by a decision made in 2010 defined collective rights as rights that are \"held by a human group considered not as an aggregate of individual interests, but as a true autonomous entity\".3\n\nSupplement - Official Gazette No. 176, 21 April 2010; in the original Spanish \" *recaen sobre un grupo humano considerado no como agregado de intereses individuales, sino como verdadero sujeto moral aut\u00f3nomo.* \" [CLA-562].\n\n67.\n\nLastly, the Claimants contend that the particular cause of action invoked by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs is irrelevant. The Claimants emphasise that it is necessary to distinguish between \"legal standing\" (i.e. the rules regarding when a person can represent a diffuse right), \"cause of action\" (i.e. the particular vehicle that a person uses to vindicate a diffuse right) and the \"substantive nature of the right at issue\". The Claimants assert that that it is only the latter which is relevant to the question of whether the Lago Agrio case was a claim for diffuse rights.\n\n68.\n\n*Article 2236:* The Claimants contend that Article 2236 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code cannot support the Lago Agrio Judgment (as it purports to do).4 The Claimants highlight the following principal matters:\n\nArticle 2236 of the Civil Code provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \" *Por regla general se concede acci\u00f3n popular en todos los casos de da\u00f1o contingente que por imprudencia o negligencia de alguno amenace a personas indeterminadas. Pero si el da\u00f1o amenazare solamente a personas determinadas, s\u00f3lo alguna de \u00e9stas podr\u00e1 intentar la acci\u00f3n.* \" (\"As a general rule, a popular action is granted in all cases of contingent harm which, due to recklessness or negligence of a party threatens undetermined persons. But if the harm threatened only determined persons, only one of these may pursue the action.\").\n\n69.\n\nFirst, Article 2236 is confined to situations in which a person's negligence has created a state of affairs that may cause contingent harm in the future. The only remedy available is injunctive relief, but such injunctive relief was not claimed in the Lago Agrio Complaint.\n\n70.\n\nSecond, a claim under Article 2236 can only be brought against the person in control of the hazardous condition at the time when the claim is initiated - in this instance PetroEcuador. The latter was not named as defendant in the Lago Agrio Complaint.\n\n71.\n\nThird, there must be a finding of negligence, but the Lago Agrio Judgment specifically disclaims the necessity to find negligence.\n\n72.\n\nFourth, in any event, the Claimants submit that, if this were a claim under Article 2236, it could only have been a diffuse claim because it is clear that the Lago Agrio Judgment was vindicating only diffuse rights. In particular, the Claimants contend that the Judgment focused on the risk of harm to undetermined individuals and note that the Cassation Decision, referring to Article 2236, stated that \"... it is through the use of this type of action that it is possible to protect collective interests\".\n\n73.\n\n*Article 2214:* The Claimants further submit that, to the extent that the Respondent asserts that the Lago Agrio Judgment was also based upon the individual tort cause of action in Article 2214 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Court was also using that provision to find a diffuse right.5\n\nArticle 2214 of the Civil Code provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \" *El que* *ha cometido un delito o cuasidelito que ha inferido da\u00f1o a otro, est\u00e1 obligado a la indemnizaci\u00f3n; sin perjuicio de la pena que le impongan las leyes por el delito o cuasidelito.* \"(\"Whoever commits an offense or tort resulting in harm to another shall indemnify the affected party, without detriment to the penalty provided by law for such offense or tort.\").\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants conclude therefore that all these diffuse claims were barred by the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Claimants assert that Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement bars all actions under the Civil Code and that the Tribunal's reasoning in the First Partial Award (regarding the *res judicata erga omnes* effect of the settlement of diffuse claims under Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution) applies equally to claims which use the provisions of the Civil Code to assert diffuse rights.6\n\nArticle 19-2 of the Constitution provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \" *Sin* *perjuicio de otros derechos necesarios para el pleno desenvolvimiento moral y material que se deriva* *de la naturaleza de la persona, el Estado le garantiza: (...) 2. El derecho de vivir en un medio ambiente libre de contaminaci\u00f3n. Es deber del Estado velar para que este derecho no sea afectado y tutelar la preservaci\u00f3n de la naturaleza. La ley establecer\u00e1 las restricciones al ejercicio de determinados derechos o libertades, para proteger el medio ambiente;* \" (\"Notwithstanding other rights which are necessary for the full moral and material development that is derived from the nature of the person, the State guarantees:... 2. The right to live in an environment free of pollution. It is the duty of the State to ensure that this right is not affected and to promote the preservation of nature. The law shall establish the limitations on the exercising of certain rights and freedoms, to protect the environment;\").\n\n75.\n\n*Aguinda Litigation:* It is asserted by the Claimants that the Aguinda Litigation in New York is irrelevant, since the claims in that litigation were aggregated individual claims, rather than diffuse claims. The Claimants rely, inter alia, on the Tribunal's decision in the First Partial Award that, as at 1995 (that is two years *after* the commencement of the Aguinda Litigation in New York), only the Respondent had the ability to represent diffuse interests in Ecuadorian litigation.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the Respondent has accepted in this arbitration that the claims asserted in the Aguinda Litigation were individual claims. It is suggested that the Respondent now seeks improperly to argue that the Aguinda Plaintiffs also asserted diffuse claims, based on their pleaded request for equitable relief. The Claimants reject this proposition, contending that the equitable relief requested in *Aguinda* was sought as a remedy to uphold individual rights and that it could not constitute a diffuse claim.\n\n77.\n\n*EMA:* The Claimant also submits that the change brought about by the Environmental Management Act 1999, giving individuals standing to pursue claims asserting certain rights before the Ecuadorian Courts, cannot operate to revive a diffuse right under Article 19-2 of the Constitution which had already been extinguished by the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n78.\n\n*Alleged Breach - 1995 Settlement Agreement:* In relation to alleged breaches of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Claimants' case is that the Respondent is obliged to act in good faith under Ecuadorian law (as its applicable law) so as to ensure that the Claimants obtain the \"benefit of the bargain\" in the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n79.\n\nIn the Claimants' submission, the Respondent thereby entered into a commitment that the Claimants would not be liable in respect of any diffuse claims brought on behalf of any community; and that this commitment imposes both a positive obligation on the Respondent to do whatever is necessary to effectuate the releases and a negative obligation preventing the Respondent from supporting third parties in bringing diffuse claims against the Claimants.\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this is an obligation of result (not means): i.e. that the Respondent has effectively guaranteed that the Claimants would be free from any further liability for diffuse claims; and that this commitment is not diminished by the absence of a \u2018hold harmless' clause in the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants therefore assert that they have: (i) the right to be free from all diffuse rights claims by whomsoever they may be brought; (ii) the right to the res judicata effect of the releases under Ecuadorian law; and (iii) the right to the Respondent's good faith performance of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent has breached the 1995 Settlement Agreement through the actions and omissions of both its executive and its judiciary. The Claimants rely, in particular, upon the following allegations:\n\n83.\n\nFirst, notwithstanding that, in executing the 1995 Settlement Agreement the Respondent represented that it thereby settled any claims in respect of the community's diffuse rights, the community sued the Claimants using the procedural mechanism subsequently created by the Respondent in the Environmental Management Act 1999.\n\n84.\n\nSecond, the Respondent (by its executive) failed to notify the Lago Agrio Court that the Lago Agrio claims had been released and that the Claimants were therefore not liable for any environmental damage.\n\n85.\n\nThird, the Respondent (by its executive) worked with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to nullify the 1995 Settlement Agreement, in particular through pursuing sham criminal prosecutions against the Claimants' lawyers.\n\n86.\n\nFourth, the Respondent's President has publicly denounced the Claimants' lawyers as \" *vende patrias\"* (corrupt traitors); has personally called upon the President of Argentina to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment; and has launched a \"Dirty Hand of Chevron\" campaign.\n\n87.\n\nFifth, the Respondent's Courts accepted jurisdiction over the Claimants and have issued judgments, both at first instance and on appeal, holding the Claimants liable for environmental damage. Further, the Respondent's judiciary has issued a \" *mandamiento de ejecuci\u00f3n\"*, thereby enabling the international enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment; it has attached the trademarks and Ecuadorian bank accounts of a subsidiary of the Claimant; and it has also attached the *Commercial Cases* award.\n\n88.\n\nSixth, the Respondent (by its executive) has undertaken a global campaign to promote the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment. For example, its Ombudsman's Office has filed an amicus brief with the Argentine enforcement court stating that the Lago Agrio Judgment warranted enforcement in Argentina.\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the significance that the Respondent attaches to the decision of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court in the *Delfina* case (2003): see the summary of the Respondent's submissions below. The Claimants agree that *Delfina* addressed individual claims and not a diffuse claim.7 They point to the clarification of the \"Twenty-Seventh\" finding: \"... in the event of harm sustained due to harm or facts giving rise to extra-contractual civil liability, the victim is entitled to receive from the party responsible the reparation of the injuries that he/she may have suffered, the action for civil liability that protects him/her is designed to procure such reparation...\"8\n\nD2,386-387b (Mr Coriell)\n\n*Delfina*, see footnote 18 below, Clarification, \"Third\" finding, p. 2.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants note the absence from the *Delfina* case of any reference to the Environmental Management Act 1999. The Claimants submit that, until that legislation, only the Ecuadorian State had the authority or standing to pursue or settle a public diffuse claim for harm to the environment and that individuals did not have the right to sue other individuals for diffuse public environmental harm.9 According to the Claimants, Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act addresses substantive collective rights to enjoy an environment that is both healthy and free of contamination, such as the right under Article 19-2 of the Constitution; and that such rights give rise to a diffuse claim and not an individual claim.10 Accordingly, according to the Claimants, the Lago Agrio Complaint was materially different from the *Delfina* case under Ecuadorian law, as it was also from the claims pleaded in *Aguinda* under the laws of the USA *.*\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits dated 6 September 2010, para. 71.\n\nD2,363 (Mr Coriell).\n\n91.\n\n*Alleged Breach - BIT:* The Claimants' case is that by its conduct, the Respondent has breached its obligations under the USA-Ecuador BIT to accord the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") and full protection and security (\"FPS\") and to provide the Claimants with an effective means of enforcing their rights (\"Effective Means\"). The Claimants also contend that the Respondent is in breach of the BIT's umbrella clause.\n\n92.\n\n*FET:* In relation to the claim in respect of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT, the Claimants assert that the Respondent's obligation to perform the 1995 Settlement Agreement in good faith gave rise to certain legitimate expectations by the Claimants as to how the Claimants would be treated, in particular an expectation that the Respondent would provide finality and res judicata effect to the releases in the 1995 Settlement Agreement and that it would not seek to frustrate or undermine those releases.\n\n93.\n\n*FPS:* The Claimants assert that the BIT's obligation of full protection and security required the Respondent to exercise reasonable vigilance to protect the Claimants' contractual and legal rights before the Ecuadorian Courts. The Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached these obligations, for example by prosecuting the Claimants' lawyers, by taking no steps to effectuate the releases in the 1995 Settlement Agreement and by actively promoting the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment. It is asserted that these breaches go beyond breaches of the 1995 Settlement Agreement themselves and represent breaches of the Claimants' related rights under the BIT, such as the right to due process.\n\n94.\n\n*Effective Means:* In relation to the BIT's obligation to provide effective means, the Claimants submit that this standard is independent from the concept of denial of justice and applies to a failure to enforce rights in individual cases. The Claimants contend that the Respondent cannot merely rely upon the fact that there are court mechanisms but must show that the means for enforcing rights are effective in individual cases. It is argued that the Respondent violated this provision, through its judiciary and its executive, by failing to enforce the Claimants' contractual and legal rights to be released from all diffuse environmental claims in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n95.\n\n*Umbrella Clause:* As to breach of the BIT's umbrella clause, the Claimants' case is that the releases in the 1995 Settlement Agreement constituted a contractual and legal obligation and that they were entered into \"with regard to an investment\".\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants rely upon the decision in *Continental Casualty v Argentina* as establishing that privity of contract is not necessary to trigger the protection of the umbrella clause, since it applies to obligations which a party has entered into *\"with regard to investments\";* and its scope is therefore broader than contracts with foreign investors.11\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008 (Sacerdoti, Veeder, Nader) [CLA-209].\n\n97.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimants note, the Tribunal has already decided, in the First Partial Award, that both Chevron and TexPet are parties to the 1995 Settlement Agreement and are both \"Releasees\". The Claimants further contend, relying on *Burlington Resources v Ecuador* that it is not necessary that the contract(s) should have been made by the Respondent as a sovereign act,12 but note that, in any event, this Tribunal found in the First Partial Award that the releases under the 1995 Settlement Agreement were granted by the Respondent in a sovereign capacity.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010 (Kaufmann-Kohler, Stern, Orrego Vicu\u00f1a) [RLA-39], para. 190.\n\n98.\n\nIt is submitted by the Claimants that the Respondent failed properly to support the objectives of these releases, failed properly to perform them in good faith and improperly frustrated the \u2018benefit of the bargain' by promoting the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' diffuse claims against the Claimants which had been finally settled under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Claimants contend that this conduct constitutes a breach of the Respondent's obligations under the BIT's umbrella clause.\n\n99.\n\n*Prescription:* The Claimants reject the several defences raised by the Respondent. In relation to the prescription defence, the Claimants' primary point is that there is no limitation period under the BIT for treaty claims under international law. In respect of Ecuadorian law claims, the Claimants argue that the five-year limitation period contained in Article 65 of the Law on Contentious Administrative Jurisdiction is not of general application, but applies only to administrative challenges. It is asserted by the Claimants that if any limitation period under Ecuadorian law were applicable, it would be the ten-year limitation period which applies to breach of contract claims under Article 2415 of the Civil Code. The Claimants submit that any prescription period could not have begun to run any earlier than October 2003, when the Claimants requested performance from the Respondent of its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement with respect to the Lago Agrio case. As the claim in this arbitration was filed by the Claimants in September 2009, the Claimants submit that the request was well within the ten-year limitation period.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants further rely on the analysis of Professor Barros in his rebuttal exert report that the obligation to release under the 1995 Settlement Agreement is a continuous and permanent obligation on the Respondent and that, therefore, the term of any limitation period must be measured from each separate act of breach. On the Claimants' case, therefore, since there have been multiple breaches of the 1995 Settlement Agreement by the Respondent since 2003, the Claimants' claims cannot be time-barred under Ecuadorian law.\n\n101.\n\n*Cassation Decision:* In response to the second defence raised by the Respondent, that the Tribunal is bound by the decision of the Cassation Court in the Lago Agrio case, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal is not required to give any deference to that decision since the First Partial Award of the Tribunal is, in accordance with Article 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, res judicata on the issues which it decided and that the Tribunal is therefore bound by its own First Partial Award. The Claimants submit that this position is also consistent with the Netherlands Code of Civil Procedure (as the lex loci arbitri). In any event, so the Claimants contend, the decisions of municipal courts are not binding upon an international tribunal; and this Tribunal has a discretion as to what deference to give to such decisions. The Claimants further contend that the Cassation Court decision is independently biased and manifestly incorrect; and that it can have no stare decisis effect upon this Tribunal.\n\n102.\n\n*The Claimants' Claimed Relief* : The Claimants contend that they are entitled, as a matter of international law, to full reparation in respect of the breaches which they allege the Respondent to have committed under the BIT. The formal relief requested by the Claimants is set out at paragraph 32 of the Claimants' Supplemental Memorial in Track I, as follows:\n\n*\"32. Claimants request relief that effectively protects their rights and reverses the harmful effects of Ecuador's breaches of the Settlement Agreements and its international law obligations. To achieve this result, Claimants respectfully request a Final Track I Award on liability and non-monetary remedies immediately after the Track I hearing specifically holding:*\n\n*A. Declaring that:*\n\n*(1) The Lago Agrio Litigation is exclusively a diffuse-rights case.*\n\n*(2) The 1999 EMA has no legal effect on the 1995 Settlement Agreement.*\n\n*(3) The Lago Agrio Litigation was barred at its inception by res judicata.*\n\n*(4) By issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment and rendering it enforceable within and without Ecuador, Ecuador violated various provisions of the BIT.*\n\n*(5) By issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment on diffuse claims barred as res judicata, Ecuador breached the 1995, 1996 and 1998 Settlement Agreements, and also violated Chevron's rights under the BIT.*\n\n*(6) The Lago Agrio Judgment is a nullity as a matter of Ecuadorian law.*\n\n*(7) The Lago Agrio Judgment is a nullity as a matter of international law.*\n\n*(8) The Lago Agrio Judgment is unlawful and consequently devoid of any legal effect.*\n\n*(9) The Lago Agrio Judgment is a violation of Chevron's rights under the BIT, and is not entitled to enforcement within or without Ecuador.*\n\n*(10) The Lago Agrio Judgment violates international public policy and natural justice, and that as a matter of international comity and public policy, the Lago Agrio Judgment should not be recognised and enforced.*\n\n*(11) By: (i) taking measures to enforce the Judgment against assets within Ecuador, and (ii) taking measures to facilitate enforcement of the Judgment in other jurisdictions, Ecuador is in breach of its obligations under the BIT, and must compensate Claimants for any sum of money collected by the Lago Agrio Claimants for any sum of money collected by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and/or their agents as a result of the Judgment.*\n\n*B. Ordering Ecuador (whether by its judicial, legislative, or executive branches):*\n\n*(1) To take all measures necessary to set aside or nullify the Lago Agrio Judgment under Ecuadorian law.*\n\n*(2) To take all measures necessary to prevent enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the Lago Agrio Judgment.*\n\n*(3) To take all measures necessary to prevent the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust from obtaining any related attachments, levies, or other enforcement devices under the impugned Judgment.*\n\n*(4) To make a written representation to any court in which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust attempt to recognise and enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment that: (i) the claims that formed the basis of the Lago Agrio Judgment were validly released under the Ecuadorian law by the Government; (ii) the Lago Agrio Judgment is a legal nullity; and (iii) any enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment will place Ecuador in violation of its obligations under the BIT.*\n\n*Claimants also request that the Tribunal provide for a subsequent phase in this arbitration to determine all costs and attorneys' fees that should be awarded to Claimants for being forced to (i) pursue this arbitration; (ii) uncover the Judgment fraud; and (iii) defend against enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in any jurisdiction.\"*\n\n***(3) The Respondent's Case***\n-------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent's primary contention is that the Claimants have failed to establish any breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In any event, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal is bound to defer to the judgments of the Ecuadorian courts on questions of Ecuadorian law and, in particular, that the Tribunal must defer to the findings of the Cassation Court, *inter alia,* that the Environmental Management Act 1999 merely governed the procedure for the Lago Agrio claims and that the grounds for liability in the Lago Agrio Judgment were exclusively in tort under Ecuadorian law, under Articles 2214 and 2236 of the Civil Code.13\n\nFor Article 2214, see footnote 5 above; and for Article 2236, see footnote 4 above\n\n104.\n\n*The 1995 Settlement Agreement:* The Respondent submits that the 1995 Settlement Agreement does not cover tort claims brought by third parties under the Civil Code. The Respondent maintains that there is a clear distinction under Ecuadorian law between diffuse, collective and individual rights and that the Lago Agrio claims concerned collective (non-diffuse) rights, brought under the procedural mechanism in Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act. The Respondent further submits that the correct interpretation of Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement is that the Ecuadorian Government is prevented from bringing any regulatory causes of action under Article 19.2 of the Constitution - which it is not alleged to have done.\n\n105.\n\nFurther, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' claims under international law, contending (inter alia) that the USA-Ecuador BIT cannot be a source of new obligations not agreed in the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n106.\n\n*Alleged Breach - 1995 Settlement Agreement:* In relation to the alleged breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have never identified the provision of the 1995 Settlement Agreement which the Respondent is said to have breached.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent contends that any obligation under Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement was, in essence, that the Respondent would not itself file suit against the Claimants in Ecuador: it has not done so; and so, therefore, there can be no breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent highlights the decision of the Tribunal in its First Partial Award that the 1995 Settlement Agreement does not include a \u2018hold-harmless' or indemnity provision. The Respondent submits that the concept of good faith is relevant under Ecuadorian law to the interpretation of the express obligations in a contract, but that it cannot be a source of new contractual obligations. It is further maintained that the \"entire agreement\" provision in Article 9.3 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement precludes any reliance by the Claimants on extra-contractual understandings.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that its judiciary cannot be in breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, since the only relevant contractual party is the Ministry of Energy and Mines; and the international legal principle that acts of the judiciary are attributable to the State does not operate to make the judiciary party to an agreement entered into by a part of the State's executive.\n\n109.\n\nIn any event, so the Respondent submits, the Claimants raised the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a defence to the Lago Agrio claims; this defence was rejected by the Ecuadorian Courts; and the Tribunal is not a court of appeal in respect of those decisions under the BIT.\n\n110.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that any claim for breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement would have to have been brought against the Respondent within five years of the alleged breach in accordance with the Law of Contentious Administration Jurisdiction. The Respondent characterises the alleged breach as occurring either from the moment that the 1995 Settlement Agreement was concluded (on the basis that the Claimants' case must be that the Respondent should have informed the New York Court that the claim had been released) or, at the latest, when the Lago Agrio Complaint was filed in 2003 - that is six years before this arbitration was commenced by the Claimants.\n\n111.\n\n*The Ecuadorian Court Judgments:* The Respondent contends that the Tribunal is bound to defer to the judgments of the Ecuadorian courts on Ecuadorian law. The Respondent acknowledges that the judgments are not res judicata in this arbitration and that the Tribunal is not bound by them in a strict legal sense. However, it is asserted, by reference to the approach of the International Court of Justice in *Diallo (Republic of Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo)* (2007) and the ICSID Ad Hoc Committee in *Helnan v Egypt* (2010), that the Tribunal must defer to the interpretation of Ecuadorian law given by the Ecuadorian courts, unless those judgments are defective as a matter of international law.14\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo)*, Judgment (Preliminary Objections), 24 May 2007, 2007 ICJ Reports 582 *;* *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision on Annulment, 14 June 2010 (Schwebel, Ajibola, McLachlan) *.*\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that, although the Claimants have sought to impugn the judgment of the Lago Agrio Court, they have not challenged the decision of the Cassation Court [sic: but see above]. In any event, the Respondent submits, the judgments of the Ecuadorian Courts are correct.\n\n113.\n\n*The Cassation Court:* In this regard, the Respondent relies on the following decisions by the Cassation Court:\n\na. That the Environmental Management Act 1999 does not contain substantive rights which were relied upon by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, but merely established a procedure for civil redress;\n\nb. That Articles 2214 (and specifically strict liability under Article 2229) and 2236 (threat of contingent harm) of the Civil Code15 could be applied in a special proceeding under the Environmental Management Act;\n\nc. That the 1995 Settlement Agreement had no *erga omnes* effects, but was simply an agreement signed by governmental institutions and the Second Claimant (TexPet);\n\nd. That third generation rights are not represented by state institutions and therefore the obligations caused by environmental damage cannot be extinguished by agreements between municipalities, government ministers and companies;\n\ne. Representation of collective rights had not been granted to ministries or municipalities, but to groups whose rights have been impacted, and therefore the ministries and municipalities had no power to settle such claims;\n\nf. The Environmental Management Act took effect in July 1999, well before the Lago Agrio Complaint was filed in May 2003 and therefore the Lago Agrio Court did not improperly apply those provisions;\n\ng. Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act regulates the procedure in civil actions for environmental harm whilst the Civil Code regulates and determines liability;16\n\nh. Article 2214 of the Civil Code does not contemplate only individual actions but provides for a popular action for cases of contingent damage in which undetermined persons are threatened. It is clear from the *Delfina* case that this cause of action existed before the 1998 Constitution and the Environmental Management Act 1999 came into effect;17 and\n\ni. Under Article 2236 of the Civil Code, it is possible to protect collective interests, not only in the sense of preventing future violations of the right but also returning matters to their proper state.\n\nFor Articles 2214 and 2236 of the Civil Code, see footnotes 4-5 above. Article 2229 of the Civil Code provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \" *Por regla general todo da\u00f1o que pueda imputarse a malicia o negligencia de otra persona debe ser reparado por \u00e9sta. Est\u00e1n especialmente obligados a esta reparaci\u00f3n: 1. El que provoca explosiones o combusti\u00f3n en forma imprudente; 2. El que dispara imprudentemente una arma de fuego; 3. El que remueve las losas de una acequia o ca\u00f1er\u00eda en calle o camino, sin las precauciones necesarias para que no caigan los que por all\u00ed transitan de d\u00eda o de noche; 4. El que, obligado a la construcci\u00f3n o reparaci\u00f3n de un acueducto o puente que atraviesa un camino, lo tiene en estado de causar da\u00f1o a los que transitan por \u00e9l; y, 5. El que fabricare y pusiere en circulaci\u00f3n productos, objetos o artefactos que, por defectos de elaboraci\u00f3n o de construcci\u00f3n, causaren accidentes, responder\u00e1 de los respectivos da\u00f1os y perjuicios.* \" (\"As a general rule, all damages that can be attributed to malice or negligence by another person must be compensated for by that person. Individuals especially obligated to this compensation include: 1. An individual who causes fires or explosions recklessly; 2. An individual who recklessly shoots a firearm; 3. An individual who removes flagstones from a trench or pipe in the street or along a road without necessary precautions to prevent those traveling during the day or night from falling; 4. An individual who, obligated to build or repair an aqueduct or bridge that crosses a road, maintains it in such a state that it causes injury to those who cross it; and, 5. An individual who manufactures and circulates products, objects, or devices that cause accidents due to construction or manufacturing defects, shall be held liable for the respective damages.\").\n\nFor Article 43 of the EMA, see footnote 25 below.\n\nFor the *Delfina* case, see footnote 18 below.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondent's case is, therefore, that the question currently for the Tribunal is whether the claims of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, which were based on Articles 2214, 2229 and 2236 of the Civil Code, fall within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent's primary point is that the Cassation Court has decided that they do not do so; and that, accordingly, this Tribunal must defer to that decision. In any event, the Respondent submits, the decision is correct as a matter of Ecuadorian law.\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent highlights (inter alia) the following matters:\n\na. The 1995 Settlement Agreement does not refer to individual or collective or diffuse claims. Indeed there was no reference to diffuse or collective rights in Ecuadorian jurisprudence until 1998; and the lawyers responsible for drafting the 1995 Settlement Agreement therefore cannot have had such concepts in mind when they drafted the 1995 Settlement Agreement;\n\nb. The Tribunal has decided, in the First Partial Award, that the 1995 Settlement Agreement did not have *erga omnes* effect and therefore does not preclude claims made by third persons in respect of their own individual rights;\n\nc. Tort claims are individual claims, irrespective of whether or not they can be maintained collectively under the procedural mechanism established by Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act;\n\nd. The Lago Agrio Court found that the principal bases for liability were Articles 2229 (strict liability) and 2236 (threat of contingent harm). In relation to strict liability, the Lago Agrio Court relied upon the Supreme Court's judgment in **Delfina**. In that case, which was decided before the Environmental Management Act came into force, a claim for strict liability under Article 2229 was upheld by the Supreme Court. On the Claimants' case, only the State had standing to pursue or settle claims for diffuse rights in respect of harm to the environment; and therefore **Delfina** cannot have been a diffuse claim.\n\ne. The Supreme Court in **Delfina** rejected an argument that the action had been brought on behalf of the people, deciding that the court below had confused the person bringing the claim with the party who would receive the material benefit of the claim. The Supreme Court held that the **Delfina** plaintiff had not purported to act as legal representative of the public interest; and, if that plaintiff had done so, this would have constituted a procedural bar to the action; and\n\nf. Further, the remedies ordered by the Supreme Court in *Delfina* were similar to those that were ordered by the Lago Agrio Court. The plaintiff in *Delfina* did not seek individualised compensation, but rather the realisation of basic infrastructure projects which would benefit the whole community.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent's position is, therefore, that the *Delfina* case conclusively disposes of the Claimants' argument that any claim not seeking individualised compensation must be a diffuse claim. On that basis, the Respondent asserts, the Claimants have to concede that this type of claim is not within the scope of, and therefore not precluded by, the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n118.\n\n*The Delfina Case* :18 This was a decision of October 29, 2002 by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court (as it was then known) on cassation from the judgment of 22 October 2001 delivered by the Supreme Court of Justice of Esmeraldas. It was much invoked by the Respondent at the April Hearing (albeit previous to Track 1B not similarly brought to the attention of the Tribunal). It is here necessary to provide a fuller summary of the Respondent's submissions based on a description of this decision.\n\n*Delfina v PetroEcuador* [RLA-286A; C-1586], with Clarification of 25 November 2002 [RLA-511].\n\n119.\n\nIn the *Delfina* case, an environmental claim had been made against Ecuadorian state entities (including PetroEcuador) by an individual on his own behalf and also as the legal representative of a committee incorporated as a private legal entity (of which the individual plaintiff was the president and some 250 families in his parish were members, all living within an area of 25 hectares). The Esmeraldas Court had decided to dismiss the claim on procedural grounds; and the Supreme Court annulled that decision.\n\n120.\n\nIn its \"Fifth\" finding, the Supreme Court analysed the assertion that the action had been improperly brought \"on behalf of the people\". It held (as translated by the Respondent from the Spanish text, at page 4):\n\n*\"The Court hearing the case below has confused the plaintiff's representation and* *the specific content of the claim... Nowhere in the complaint is it stated that the party bringing this complaint does so as the representative of, nor on behalf of, the public interest, but rather the appellant asserts his capacity as legal representative of a private entity and in his own right and on his own behalf. If the action had been brought by a plaintiff claiming to act as legal representative of the \u2018public interest' or of society in general, doubtless this would have constituted a procedural bar to the suit, or a lack of standing to sue according to the terminology adopted by our Code of Civil Procedure, since in our system of positive law \u2018class actions' have not yet been adopted, and this lawsuit would have been barred, because it would have amounted to the situation foreseen in section 3 of article 355 of the Code of Civil Procedure.19 But if the plaintiff brings his claim in his own name, without any evidence that he is acting in one of the instances for which he lacks standing to sue, and that he also brings the suit on behalf of and as legal representative of a private legal entity, whose existence as well as whose representation have [sic: has] been duly accredited, then no procedural error regarding the claim itself or a lack of standing exists. \"20*\n\n(The Environmental Management Act was not here considered by the Supreme Court. The incidents giving rise to the claim occurred on 1 October 1997 and 26 February 1998, with the complaint filed on 3 August 1998. The Environmental Management Act 1999 came into force later on 30 July 1999).\n\nArticle 355(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure (now re-numbered Article 346(3)) provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \" *Son solemnidades sustanciales comunes a todos los juicios e instancias: (\u2026) 3. Legitimidad de personer\u00eda;* \" (\"Substantive formalities which are common to all proceedings and instances, are:... 3. Legal capacity;\").\n\nIn the original Spanish: \" *El juzgador de \u00faltimo nivel confunde entre la postulaci\u00f3n y el contenido concreto de la pretensi\u00f3n (\u2026) En ninguna parte de la demanda aparece que quien la deduce se haya atribuido la calidad de vocero y representante del pueblo, sino que invoca la calidad de representante legal de una persona jur\u00eddica de derecho privado y adem\u00e1s sus propios y personales derechos. Si se hubiera deducido la acci\u00f3n pretendiendo ser representante legal del \u2018pueblo', o sea del conglomerado social, indudablemente se habr\u00eda configurado el vicio de falta de legitimaci\u00f3n en el proceso, o ilegitimidad de personer\u00eda seg\u00fan la terminolog\u00eda de nuestro C\u00f3digo de Procedimiento Civil, ya que a\u00fan no se recoge en nuestro sistema de derecho positivo las llamadas \u2018acciones de clase', y el proceso habr\u00eda sido nulo por hallarse incurso en la situaci\u00f3n prevista en el No. 3 del art\u00edculo 355 del C\u00f3digo de Procedimiento Civil. Pero si se demanda por los propios derechos, sin que se pruebe que el actor se halla incurso en una de las incapacidades legales, y adem\u00e1s se lo hace a nombre y en representaci\u00f3n de una persona jur\u00eddica de derecho privado, cuya existencia legal se ha acreditado as\u00ed* *como la representaci\u00f3n, no hay el vicio de falta de legitimaci\u00f3n al proceso o ilegitimidad de personer\u00eda.* \". The Tribunal notes later below the mistranslation of the original Spanish term \"pueblo\" as \"public interest\", rather than \"people\".\n\n121.\n\nIn pleading environmental harm from a fire at the refinery and the later rupture of oil and product pipelines, the plaintiff asserted a general harm: \"It is not only us, the residents of [the parish] but, generally, the city of Esmeraldas and those at other sectors of the Province, who are greatly affected by the presence of the State Refinery of Esmeraldas and the entire oil infrastructure.21 As legal grounds, the complaint pleaded (inter alia) provisions of the Constitution, as well as several provisions of the Civil Code (including Article 2256, then equivalent to Article 2229).22\n\n*Delfina* Complaint [R-1188].\n\nFor Article 2229 of the Civil Code, see footnote 15 above.\n\n122.\n\nIn its \"Twentieth\" finding, the Supreme Court defined the three elements required for a finding of tort liability in damages under the Civil Code: (i) damage or loss; (ii) fault and (iii) a causal link between the one and the other (page 21). As to fault, the decision founded strict liability for certain environmental wrongdoings under Article 2256 of the Civil Code (later Article 2229). It here maintained the causal requirement between liability and the plaintiff's loss or damage, signifying that it was describing an individual claim and not a diffuse claim. The plaintiff had pleaded damage caused to himself by the defendants' wrongdoing.23\n\n*Delfina* Complaint (ibid), p. 21.\n\n123.\n\nIn its \"Twenty-Seventh\" finding, the Supreme Court considered the relief claimed by the plaintiff intended to benefit an entire community. It held (as translated from the Spanish text, at page 33):\n\n*\"... In the case under review, the plaintiff, showing a high degree of social solidarity, in his complaint does not seek individualized compensation but instead seeks the realization of basic infrastructure projects that would benefit the whole of the community. Specifically he requests the following be done in the [parish]: installation of sewage and wastewater lines, treatment plant for sewage and wastewater lines, rainwater drainage system, placement of a rock base in the riverbeds, a concrete retention wall, a medical dispensary.[It is here unnecessary for the Tribunal to complete the long list of remedial reparations]. These work projects clearly will not become part of the patrimony of the Improvement Committee, but instead would become part of property intended for public use, as per article 626 of the Civil Code, which are organized and administered by State entities and institutions.\".24*\n\nIn the original Spanish: \" *En el caso sub lite, con un elevado sentido de solidaridad social, la parte actora en su demanda no pretende indemnizaciones individuales sino la ejecuci\u00f3n de obras de infraestructura b\u00e1sicas, en beneficio de la comunidad. Espec\u00edficamente su pretensi\u00f3n es de que, en el barrio Delfina Torres viuda de Concha, Propicia No. 1, se construyan las siguientes obras: red de alcantarillado sanitario; planta de tratamiento de alcantarillado sanitario; red de alcantarillado de aguas lluvias; enrocado base en riberas de los r\u00edos; muro de contenci\u00f3n de hormig\u00f3n armado; dispensario m\u00e9dico; equipamiento del dispensario m\u00e9dico; aceras y bordillos y escalinatas; canchas de uso m\u00faltiple con grader\u00edos; adoquinado vehicular de calles; alumbrado del parque forestal y p\u00fablico; adecentamiento del parque forestal; pasos peatonales y desnivel, y colegio secundario moderno y equipamiento. Est\u00e1s obras obviamente no ingresar\u00edan al patrimonio del Comit\u00e9 Pro mejoras del barrio Delfina Torres viuda de Concha, Propicia No. 1, sino que pasar\u00edan a formar parte de los bienes de uso p\u00fablico previstos en el art\u00edculo 626 del C\u00f3digo Civil, que son organizados y administrados por los organismos y entidades del Estado* \".\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent submits, from the text of the decision, that: (i) the *****Delfina***** case was brought before the Environmental Management Act 1999 came into force and accordingly the result was not affected by the 1999 Act [p. 14]; (ii) the *****Delfina***** case did not concern a diffuse claim, but, rather, an individual claim [pp. 4-5]; (iii) the sole bases for liability in *****Delfina***** were Articles 2214 and 2229 of the Civil Code [pp. 21-26]; and (iv) the remedies sought and ordered in *****Delfina***** were not individualised damages, but remedial reparations similar to those pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Complaint: namely to the effect that the defendants in *****Delfina***** were liable to carry out infrastructure projects \"that would benefit the whole of the community\" and take measures to prevent further damage from occurring (e.g. by adopting security measures at the refinery) [pp. 33-34]. In other words, so the Respondent submits, the Supreme Court in *Delfina* would not have allowed a diffuse claim to be made by the plaintiff, but it did allow an individual claim to be made even where the relief claimed by that plaintiff (not being damages) would benefit the affected community as a whole.\n\n125.\n\nApart from the additional ground of liability allegedly based on Article 2236 of the Civil Code (formerly Article 2260), the Respondent submits that there is no material difference between the *Lago Agrio* and *Delfina* cases. Article 2236 has been part of the civil law of Ecuador since 1861; and it does not signify a diffuse claim. Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that the Lago Agrio Complaint was made as an individual claim, materially similar to the Aguinda Complaint in New York, and not as a diffuse claim.\n\n126.\n\nAs regards the Environmental Management Act 1999, the Respondent submits that its absence in the *Delfina* case does not distinguish that case from the Lago Agrio Complaint. The Respondent submits that Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act is only a procedural mechanism for aggregating individual claims at civil law by persons linked by a common interest and affected directly by the harmful act.25 It did not create new causes of action or alter the substantive nature of rights invocable by a plaintiff making an environmental claim. Article 43 allows, effectively, a form of class action to vindicate aggregated individual rights; and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs \"could not have used the procedural mechanism of Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act unless they were affected by the harmful act or omission. That was the basis of their whole claim, just as it was the basis of their claim in Aguinda.\"26 Accordingly, according to the Respondent, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' invocation of the Environmental Management Act in their complaint is here irrelevant and does not distinguish their pleading from *Delfina.27*\n\nD1,224 (Professor Douglas). Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act 1999 provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \" *Las personas naturales, jur\u00eddicas o grupos humanos, vinculados por un inter\u00e9s com\u00fan y afectados directamente por la acci\u00f3n u omisi\u00f3n da\u00f1osa podr\u00e1n interponer ante el Juez competente, acciones por da\u00f1os y perjuicios y por el deterioro causado a la salud o al medio ambiente incluyendo la biodiversidad con sus elementos constitutivos.* \" (\"The individuals, legal entities or human groups linked by a common interest and affected directly by the harmful act or omission may file before the court with jurisdiction actions for damages and for deterioration caused to health or the environment, including biodiversity and its constituent elements.\").\n\nD1,218 (Professor Douglas).\n\nD1,175, 183, 211-213 (Professor Douglas).\n\n127.\n\n*The Aguinda Litigation:* The Respondent further submits that the Lago Agrio case is simply the continuation of the Aguinda Litigation in New York. There is no dispute between the Parties that the Aguinda Plaintiffs' claims are not covered by the 1995 Settlement Agreement and, so the Respondent submits, it must follow that the Lago Agrio Complaint was also not covered by the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In particular, the Respondent emphasises that the Aguinda Plaintiffs are the same as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; and that the Aguinda Complaint included claims based upon strict liability and both public and private nuisance under the laws of the USA.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claim under Article 2236 of the Civil Code, which was upheld by the Lago Agrio Court, is similar to a claim in public or private nuisance under the laws of the USA and that, although the claims in *Aguinda* may have been broader, the tort claims before the Lago Agrio Court are roughly equivalent to the tort claims which were before the New York Court. Moreover, so the Respondent notes, the Aguinda Plaintiffs sought the same equitable relief before the New York Court as was sought by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs before the Lago Agrio Court.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the issue of whether the Lago Agrio Complaint is a continuation of the Aguinda claim is res judicata in this arbitration as the point has already been decided, as between the Parties, by the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit. The Respondent submits that the Claimants contended, before the U.S. Court of Appeals, that the Aguinda Plaintiffs would have an adequate alternative forum in Ecuador to pursue their civil tort claims and to obtain equitable relief and that an affidavit, signed by five of the Claimants' expert witnesses on Ecuadorian law and filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals, stated that the claims based on Articles 2214 and 2236 of the Civil Code would not be within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In summary, so the Respondent contends, the Court of Appeals would not have dismissed the Aguinda case on *forum non conveniens* grounds had it not been persuaded by the Claimants themselves that the Aguinda Plaintiffs were entitled to pursue their claims in Ecuador.\n\n130.\n\n*Diffuse, Collective and Individual Rights:* The Respondent submits that a clear distinction should be drawn between \"diffuse\", \"collective\" and \"individual\" rights under Ecuadorian law.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon the decision of the Cassation Court and contends that \"collective\" rights can be a reference to either: (i) standing to bring a collective action to vindicate individual rights; or (ii) a right vested in a particular group of people, such as native rights. Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act is an example of the first meaning of collective rights. The right, contained in Article 19-2 of the Constitution, to live in an environment free of pollution, is an individual right; but it can be vindicated through a collective action. Such an action is not a representative action (in the sense of a class action), but rather it allows a person to bring a civil action in relation to a collective interest and to seek a remedy which may benefit a large group of people.\n\n132.\n\nThe Cassation Court adopted the definition of collective rights laid down by the Supreme Court of Venezuela that: \"... this refers to a certain sector of the population (although not quantified) that is identifiable, although individually; within that group of people there is or there might be a legal tie that links them to each other. Injury is specifically located in a group that can be determined as such, such as professional groups, groups of neighbours, guilds or inhabitants of a certain area.\" The Respondent submits that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs clearly fall within this definition: they are inhabitants of a certain area; the alleged injury is located within that group; and, in accordance with Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were directly affected by the alleged harmful act or omission.\n\n133.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"diffuse\" rights by contrast, were defined by the Cassation Court as referring: \"to an asset that is of interest to the entire world (plurality of subjects) that is, to people who - in principle - do not comprise an identifiable and individualised sector of the population, and who, without a legal link between them, are harmed or threatened with harm.\" Standing is therefore granted to a plaintiff irrespective of whether the environmental harm has or will directly affect that plaintiff. The Respondent concludes that the Lago Agrio case did not therefore concern diffuse rights.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants now appear to rely upon the reference to \"undetermined persons\" in Article 2236 of the Civil Code as indicating that a claim thereunder could be a diffuse claim. However, so the Respondent argues, Article 2236 has contained that wording since its enactment in 1861 and merely recognises that the harm and the remedy may affect an undetermined number of people albeit within a determined class. The Respondent highlights that the suggestion that Article 2236 could found a diffuse claim is inconsistent with the Claimants' prior case that it was not possible to bring a diffuse claim in Ecuador before the Environmental Management Act was enacted in 1999. The Respondent suggests that if a concerned individual wished to bring an action to enforce a diffuse right, the relevant procedure would be found in Article 42 of the Environmental Management Act, which gives individuals or entities a right to be heard in non-civil proceedings filed for violations of an environmental nature. As to Article 43, so the Respondent concludes, this had merely effected a procedural change: the substantive requirements for standing to bring a tort claim have remained the same under the laws of Ecuador since 1861.\n\n135.\n\nIn relation to Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution, the Respondent's primary position is that the interpretation of this provision is irrelevant since liability in the Lago Agrio judgment was based on tort claims. In the alternative, however, the Respondent submits that the parenthetical words in Article 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement are a reference back to the phrase \"regulatory causes of action and penalties\". In this regard, the Respondent suggests, Article 19.2 not only confers a right to live in an environment free of pollution, but also imposes a positive duty on the State to take steps to protect that right. Consequently, so the Respondent submits, the State might be subject to a \"regulatory cause of action\" under Article 19.2. The Respondent respectfully disagrees with the Tribunal's earlier decision (in the First Partial Award) that only the Respondent could bring a diffuse claim under Article 19-2 to protect the rights of citizens to live in an environment free from pollution, on the basis that constitutional rights are by definition individual rights.\n\n136.\n\n*Alleged Breach - BIT:* Finally, in response to the Claimants' arguments on its alleged breaches of the USA-Ecuador BIT, the Respondent first asserts that there is a jurisdictional bar on the basis that, in Track I, the Tribunal can only exercise jurisdiction under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT - that is, in relation to disputes arising out of or relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent contends that the Claimants have not attempted to link their claims under the BIT to any rights alleged to exist in the 1995 Settlement Agreement, but have merely attempted to characterise their treaty claims as somehow relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In any event, so the Respondent submits, the Claimants have been unable to identify any relevant obligation under the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and, therefore, there can be no question of international responsibility upon the Respondent for any alleged breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement by the Respondent.\n\n137.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent emphasises as regards the Claimants' claims under the BIT that:\n\na. The BIT's umbrella clause cannot be used as a source of new obligations which were not contracted by the signatory parties to the 1995 Settlement Agreement;\n\nb. The doctrine of legitimate expectations should not be used as a substitute for the actual contractual arrangements agreed between the signatory parties; and\n\nc. The effective means provision of the BIT cannot impose an obligation upon the Respondent by its legal system to uphold alleged rights which the Claimants do not have under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n138.\n\n*The Respondent's Requested Relief* : At paragraph 143 of its Supplemental\n\nCounter-Memorial, the Respondent requests the following relief in Track 1B:\n\n*\"143. Based on the foregoing, together with the Republic's previous Track I submissions and argument and testimony presented in the November 2012 Hearing on the Merits, the Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal issue* *an Award that:*\n\n*(a) Denies all the relief and each remedy requested by Claimants in relation to Track I, including the relief and remedies requested in Paragraph 32 of* *Claimants' Supplemental Track I Memorial;*\n\n*(b) Dismisses on the merits Chevron's claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release;*\n\n*(c) Dismisses on the merits TexPet's claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release;*\n\n*(d) Declares specifically that the Respondent has not breached the 1995 Settlement Agreement or the 1998 Final Release;*\n\n*(e) Dismisses all of Claimants' claims as they relate to the 1996 Local Settlements, reached between TexPet and local government entities;*\n\n*(f) Declares that the Lago Agrio Litigation was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel;*\n\n*(g) Awards Respondent all costs and attorneys' fees incurred by Respondent in connection with this phase of the proceedings; and*\n\n*(h) Awards Respondent any further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.\"*\n\n***PART D: THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS***\n-------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\n*The First Partial Award:* As already indicated in the Preface above, the Tribunal left undecided for decision in a later award or awards certain issues listed in Paragraph 93 of the Tribunal's First Partial Award. These issues merit here reciting in full:\n\n*\"... (i) whether or not the Respondent has breached Article 5 of the 1995* *Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the Final Release; and, if so, precisely what remedies are available to Chevron and/or TexPet against the Respondent in respect of any such breach (i.e. damages, declaratory relief or specific performance);*\n\n*(ii) whether or not the claims pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs rest upon individual rights, as distinct from \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" rights (in whole or in part) and whether or not those claims are materially similar to the claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York; and*\n\n*(iii) the specific effect of any changes in Ecuadorian law taking place after the execution of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release, including the interpretation and application of the 1999 Environmental Management Act...\".*\n\n(The Tribunal also left undecided certain other issues listed in Paragraphs 109 and 110 of the First Partial Award (page 44); but these issues do not require its decision here).\n\n140.\n\nIn other circumstances, whilst not strictly bound to follow their result or reasoning as a matter of international law, this Tribunal would have wished to be guided, as regards any relevant issue of Ecuadorian law, by the decisions of the Lago Agrio Court28, the Appellate Court of Lago Agrio29 and the Cassation Court.30\n\nSuch an approach would extend beyond courtesy, comity and due respect for the Respondent's judicial branch. As a practical matter, without more, the considered judgments of any municipal court applying its own municipal law, especially an appellate court, are (absent special circumstances) the best evidence of the content and application of that law to the same or similar situations. Further, the publicly stated reasons of a municipal court would ordinarily carry far more weight than the submissions of disputing parties. This orthodox approach appears to be common ground between the Parties, based on the well-known decision of the International Court of Justice in *Diallo.31*\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment of 9 February 2011 [C-931]; and its Clarification Order of 4 March 2011 [C-971].\n\nThe Appellate Court Judgment of 3 January 2012 [C-991], with its execution order of 3 August 2012 [C-1404].\n\nThe Cassation (National) Court Judgment of 12 November 2013 [C-1975].\n\n*Diallo*, see footnote 14 above; see D1,167-168 (Professor Douglas); and at the November Hearing, D1.13 (Professor Crawford).\n\n141.\n\nHowever, the Parties' dispute in this arbitration has given rise to very unusual, if not wholly exceptional, circumstances, which preclude this Tribunal from adopting this orthodox approach - for the time being.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimants' allegations of multiple denials of justice against the judgments of the Respondent's Courts, made after the commencement of this arbitration, are as grave as could be made against state courts under international law. Under the well-known orthodox approach described by Professor Brierly, \"even on the wider interpretation of the term \u2018denial of justice'..... the misconduct must be extremely gross.\"32 The Tribunal cannot, fairly or properly, decide now whether or not any of the Claimants' allegations of misconduct are correct and, if correct, amount to extremely gross misconduct under international law. All such allegations, together with the Respondent's jurisdictional objection and denials, have been put back to Track 2 in these arbitration proceedings, by previous procedural orders made by the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties as described in Part B above.\n\nJ.L. Brierly, *The Law of Nations* (1963) p. 287: \"It will be observed that even on the wider interpretation of the term \u2018denial of justice' which is here adopted, the misconduct must be extremely gross. The justification of this strictness is that the independence of courts is an accepted canon of decent government, and the law [i.e. international law] therefore does not hold a state responsible for their faults. It follows than an allegation of a denial of justice is a serious step which states, as mentioned above, are reluctant to take when a claim can be based on other grounds [i.e. an international claim in support of its aggrieved national].\"\n\n143.\n\nMoreover, however conditionally and provisionally, given its disputed jurisdiction and the gravity of the Claimants' allegations, the Tribunal also cannot here, fairly or properly, assume the outcome of these important issues one way or the other, for the sake of argument or otherwise. It explicitly does not do so in this decision.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the approach taken by the ICSID Ad Hoc Committee in its Decision on Annulment in *Fraport v Philippines* to the effect that a relevant decision by a municipal authority \"may need to be scrutinized very carefully by an international tribunal. The tribunal would need to satisfy itself, inter alia, as to the impartiality of the relevant decision-maker, in view of the proceedings against the state of which that decision-maker is an organ.\"33 The Tribunal also notes the similar approach taken by the ICSID Ad Hoc Committee in *Helnan v Egypt*.34\n\n*Fraport v Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on Annulment, 23 December 2010 (Tomka, Hascher, McLachlan), para 242 [CLA-572].\n\n*Helnan v Egypt*, see footnote 14 above, paras 48-51.\n\n145.\n\n*Issue (ii):* Accordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it cannot decide before Track 2 the issues (i) and (iii) listed above. It can, however, fairly and properly decide Issue (ii) listed above, to the extent that that a decision on that issue does not depend upon any conduct or judgment of the Respondent's Courts but, rather, only the written pleading originally issued by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, namely the Lago Agrio Complaint filed before the Lago Agrio Court on 17 May 2003. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' case was later modified before the Lago Agrio Court; but at that point the Claimants' allegations become potentially relevant. Hence, for the purpose of this decision, the Tribunal limits Issue (ii) to the original Lago Agrio Complaint.\n\n146.\n\nFor this Issue (ii), as limited above, the Tribunal's starting-point is not materially in dispute between the Parties. As the Claimants have made clear on numerous occasions in this arbitration, there was no intended obstacle to the Aguinda Plaintiffs re-stating their claims made in the Aguinda Litigation in New York in the form of a new complaint making similar claims before the Lago Agrio Court, albeit under the different substantive and procedural laws applicable in Ecuador. For example, when Texaco Inc. sought to dismiss the Aguinda Plaintiffs' claim in New York on grounds of forum non conveniens, it did so \"without prejudice to plaintiffs' right to refile their individual monetary damage claims against TexPet in Ecuador\";35 and the Claimants accept that the Aguinda Plaintiffs were asserting \"an aggregated individual-rights case...\"36 As to such differences, it was understood by the signatory parties to the 1995 Settlement Agreement that Ecuadorian law did not permit class actions, such as were permitted in the US\u00c4. The Tribunal also notes that later, in 2002, the Supreme Court in the *Delfina* case observed that: \".. In our system of positive law \u2018class actions' have not yet been adopted..\".37\n\n*Aguinda v Texaco Inc*., No. 93-CV-7527 (SDNY), Defendant Texaco Inc.'s Report on the Settlement Between Texaco Petroleum Company, The Republic of Ecuador, and Petroecuador and Texaco Inc.'s Response to the Court's Proposed Conditions for Dismissal of Litigation, 22 December 1994 [C-342].\n\nClaimants' Track 1 Reply Memorial on the Merits dated 29 \u00c4ugust 2012, para. 103.\n\nSee the Supreme Court's \"Fifth\" finding, para. 111 & footnote 20 above.\n\n147.\n\n*The Aguinda Complaint:* The \u00c4guinda Complaint was filed in New York on 3 November 1993, two years before the 1995 Settlement \u00c4greement. It pleaded a claim by the \u00c4guinda Plaintiffs as a class action (uncertified) under the US\u00c4's Federal Rules of Procedure, by named individuals and \"on behalf of a class of all others similarly situated\" for personal injuries and property damage caused by the defendant's wrongdoing.38 \u00c4s pleaded, the named individuals and the unnamed class members (estimated as numbering 30,000) were all resident in Ecuador from 1972 onwards within a geographical area defined by latitude and longitude, south of the Colombian border.39\n\nThe *Aguinda* Complaint of 3 November 1993, pp. 2-3 [C-14].\n\nThe *Aguinda* Complaint, pp. 17-19 [ibid].\n\n148.\n\n\u00c4s pleaded, this complaint asserts individual civil claims for personal injury and property damage, aggregated as members of the same class. The causes of action were pleaded in tort (with one statutory claim, here irrelevant), including negligence, public nuisance, private nuisance, strict liability, trespass and civil conspiracy, with relief claimed as compensatory damages, punitive damages and equitable relief to remedy the alleged pollution and contamination \"of the plaintiffs' environment and the personal injuries and property damage caused thereby\" (page 4).\n\n149.\n\nThe Aguinda Complaint in New York was not a diffuse claim. This much, at least, is common ground between the Parties.40 As the Claimants acknowledged at the April Hearing, \"... both Parties agree that what was at issue in Aguinda were individual claims, aggregate individual claims. The issue is what's at issue in Lago Agrio.\"41\n\nD1.56 (Mr Coriell).\n\nD2,372 (Mr Coriell).\n\n150.\n\n*The 1995 Settlement Agreement:* There was nothing in the 1995 Settlement Agreement which was intended to prevent the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in Ecuador from pleading environmental claims made as third persons for individual harm in respect of their individual rights independently of the Respondent and asserting rights separate and different from the Respondent, as the Tribunal decided in Paragraph 81 of the First Partial Award (page 34) and Paragraph 112(3) of its Operative Part (page 45).\n\n151.\n\nFor present purposes, the questions dividing the Parties are whether the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs asserted in their Complaint only diffuse claims, brought only in a representative capacity for their communities (but not a claim in any individual capacity or for any individual right); invoked only those communities' indivisible rights; and did not claim any individual harm or seek any individual remedy. The Claimants answer \"yes\" to these questions; and the Respondent answers \"no\".\n\n152.\n\nFor present purposes, the issue can be re-stated simply: does the Lago Agrio Complaint plead only diffuse claims as distinct from individual claims for personal harm, whether actual or threatened (as the Claimants asserted in their opening oral submissions at the April Hearing)?42\n\nD1.24 (Mr Coriell).\n\n153.\n\nIt is first necessary to clarify the special meanings attributed in this arbitration to the words \"diffuse\" and \"individual\". The differing use of these English words by the Parties, intended to equate with Ecuadorian legal terms, have unfortunately been the source of certain difficulties in this arbitration.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal decided in Paragraph 112(3) of the Operative Part of the First Partial Award that: \"The scope of the releases in Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release made by the Respondent to the First and Second Claimants does not extend to any environmental claim made by an individual for personal harm in respect of that individual's rights separate and different from the Respondent; but it does have legal effect under Ecuadorian law precluding any \u2018diffuse' claim against the First and Second Claimants under Article 19-2 of the Constitution made by the Respondent and also made by any individual not claiming personal harm (actual or threatened);\n\n*...\".*\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal's first decision in this Paragraph 112(3) - that the scope of the releases *does not* extend to any environmental claims made by an individual in respect of personal harm (or damage to personal property) violating that individual's rights, separate and different from the Respondent - identifies a category of claims that will be here referred to as \"individual\" claims. Under Ecuadorian law, an individual claim belongs to that individual with the remedy personal to that individual; and it is not a diffuse claim.\n\n156.\n\nIn contrast, the Tribunal's second decision in this Paragraph 112(3) - that the scope of the releases *does* have legal effect under Ecuadorian law precluding any diffuse claims against the First and Second Claimants under Article 19-2 of the Constitution, made by the Respondent and also made by any individual not claiming personal harm or damage to personal property (actual or threatened) -identifies a category of claims that will be here referred to as \"diffuse\" claims. Under Ecuadorian law, a diffuse claim may belong to a community of indeterminate people with the remedy indivisible; and it is not an individual claim.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasises that the terms \"individual\" claims and \"diffuse\" claims are used in this decision to denote categories of claims that the Tribunal has identified as relevant to its legal analysis of the Parties' respective cases in this decision. These English linguistic (but not legal) terms, as here used, are not otherwise intended by themselves to bear any definitive technical meaning under Ecuadorian, international law or any other law.\n\n158.\n\nFurther, in regard to its analysis of the claims pleaded in the Aguinda Litigation and the Lago Agrio Complaint, the Tribunal bears in mind its perspective as an international tribunal under the BIT: it should look at the substance and not only the form of these different pleadings, without being bound by any pleading technicalities inherent in the respective national legal systems.43\n\nSee *Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia)*, Judgment (Preliminary Objections), 1992 ICJ Reports 240, para. 65: \"Consequently, the Court notes that, from a formal point of view, the claim relating to the overseas assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, as presented in the Nauruan Memorial, is a new claim in relation to the claims presented in the Application. Nevertheless, as the Permanent Court of International Justice pointed out in the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* case: \u2018The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law.' (*P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2*, p. 34; cf. also *Northern Cameroon, I.C.J. Reports 1963*, p. 28.) The Court will therefore consider whether, although formally a new claim, the claim in question can be considered as included in the original claim in substance.\"\n\n159.\n\n*The Lago Agrio Complaint:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Complaint against Texaco Inc. as the named defendant is, in its original Spanish version, a document of 17 pages.44 It was filed on 7 May 2003, after the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The pleading begins with the list of the 48 individual plaintiffs, all being (as translated into English) \"domiciled in the Secoya Community of San Pablo de Aguarico, Canton of Shushufundi, Province of Sucumb\u00edos\" and \"Ecuadorian nationals engaged in farming activities.\" These plaintiffs are described as having been the same Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York, having there sought \"enforcement of their own rights as well as those of other people in the same class, as the term is used in [New York's] procedural rules to designate the people who might find themselves in an identical legal situation with regard to the specifics of the lawsuit [i.e. the Aguinda Litigation]\" (Paragraph 8).\n\nThe Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003 [C-71].\n\n160.\n\nPart I of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the alleged \"background\" to the case, including the 1998 Final Release (forming part of the 1995 Settlement) and the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron. Part II pleads the alleged \"contaminating methods employed by Texaco\". Part III pleads the alleged consequential \"damage and the affected population\". Its Paragraph III.2 pleads, as a matter of causation, the alleged consequences to the health and life expectancy of the population including, but not expressly so, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Part IV pleads \"Texaco Inc.'s liability\". In the latter's Paragraph IV.9, Texaco's liability and remedial obligation were allegedly \"passed on to Chevron by virtue of the merger between the two corporations\" described in Paragraph I.12. Thus far, apart from the allegations directed against Chevron, there appears to be a broad similarity between the complaint in the Aguinda Litigation and the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n161.\n\nPart V of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the \"legal basis\" for the claim. It invokes Articles 2241 and 2256 of the Civil Code, later re-numbered as Articles 2214 and 2229 (Paragraph V.1); Articles 23.6 and 86 of the Constitution, later in part Article 19-2 (Paragraph V.3(a)); Article 2260 of the Civil Code, later renumbered as Article 2236 (Paragraph V.1(b); and Articles 41 and 43 of the Environmental Management Act 1999 (Paragraph V.3(c)).45\n\nThese texts are set out earlier, in both the original Spanish and English translation: see footnotes 4 (Article 2236 of the Civil Code), 5 (Article 2214 of the Civil Code), 6 (Article 19-2 of the Constitution), 15 (Article 2229 of the Civil Code) and 30 (Article 43 of the EMA).\n\n162.\n\nThese provisions in the Environmental Management Act are alleged to establish a \"public action\" [\"acci\u00f3n p\u00fablica\"] based on the breach of environmental laws and \"the right of legal entities, individuals or human groups bound by a common interest and directly affected by a harmful action or omission, to bring an action for damages based on the harm to their health and environment, including the biodiversity along with its constituting elements.\"46 The Tribunal does not consider Article 41 of the Environmental Management Act directly relevant for present purposes. Article 43 of the Act is considered later below.\n\nIn the original Spanish: \" *reconoce a las personas naturales o jur\u00eddicas y a los grupos humanos vinculados por un inter\u00e9s com\u00fan y afectados directamente por Ia acci\u00f3n u omisi\u00f3n da\u00f1osa, el derecho a interponer acciones por da\u00f1os y perjuicios y por el deterioro causado a Ia salud o al medio ambiente, incluyendo Ia biodiversidad con sus elementos ccnstitutivos.* \".\n\n163.\n\nPart VI of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the \"prayer for relief\". It is claimed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs \"in our capacity as members of the affected communities and in safeguard of their recognized collective rights\".47 The relief claims specific remedial and ancillary works, with the necessary funds paid by Texaco to the \"Amazon Defense Front\", together with 10% of such value payable (with litigation costs) also to the Amazon Defense Front \"by express request of the plaintiffs\". It does not claim monetary compensation particular to each of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, or payment to any of them personally. Part VI addresses \"jurisdiction, amount of claim and procedure\", invoking (inter alia) Articles 42(2) and 43 of the Environmental Management Act. Part VIII addresses \"notices\".\n\nIn the original Spanish, \" *como miembros de las communidades afectadas y en guardia de los derechos reconcidos collectivamente a \u00e9stas,.* \".\n\n164.\n\nParts V and VI of the Lago Agrio Complaint could be read as including something other than an individual claim: for example (with emphases here supplied): (i) the allegation that \"environmental rights are *constitutionally* recognized as *collective* rights *... Any* person may thus seek remediation based on the breach or disregard of such rights\";48 (ii) the allegation of \"potential damage to an *undetermined* group of people... Article 2260 (now 2236) of the Civil Code provides for a popular action to compel whoever generated the threat to remove or cease its causes\";49 (iii) the claim by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs asserting \" *collective* rights\" expressly as members of the affected communities, but with no express allegation of a specific injury or specific property damage to any individual plaintiff;50 (iv) the claim to restore the public health of the *affected communities*, rather than any compensation for an individual's personal injuries or property damage payable to that individual;51 and (vi) the lack of any authorisation or powers of attorney whereby the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and/or their Ecuadorian attorney (Mr Alberto Wray) were authorised to bring a claim on behalf of unnamed persons, communities or people (said to have numbered tens of thousands during the Aguinda Litigation in New York).52\n\nThe Lago Agrio Complaint, \u00a7 V.3(a)) [ibid].\n\nThe Lago Agrio Complaint, \u00a7 V(3)(b) [ibid].\n\nThe Lago Agrio Complaint, \u00a7 VI [ibid].\n\nThe Lago Agrio Complaint, \u00a7 VI.I & 2 [ibid].\n\n*Aguinda v Texaco Inc.* 303 F.3d 470, 477-478 (2d Cir. 2002): \"... [The Aguinda] Plaintiffs' third objection is that Ecuadorian courts do not recognize class actions. On the other hand, Ecuador permits litigants with similar causes of action arising out of the same facts to join together in a single lawsuit. While the need for thousands of individual plaintiffs to authorize the action in their names is more burdensome than having them represented by a representative in a class action, it is not so burdensome as to deprive the plaintiffs of an effective alternative forum...\" [C-65]. (This appeal and judgment took place after the Environmental Management Act 1999).\n\n165.\n\nConversely, there are factors which suggest that individual claims could be pleaded in the Lago Agrio Complaint: (i) it was brought by named individuals, being the same individuals who were the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York there advancing (admittedly) individual claims; (ii) their Ecuadorian attorney whose name appears in the complaint (Mr Alberto Wray) was to act in the complaint under a power of attorney from the named Aguinda Plaintiffs; and (iii) the claim is pleaded as claims by named individuals with, possibly (as submitted by the Respondent), the Ecuadorian procedural equivalent of the class action previously sought by the same individuals in the Aguinda Litigation in New York. The Respondent acknowledges that the named Lago Agrio Plaintiffs did not and could not represent anyone but themselves before the Lago Agrio Court.53 Conversely, as the Claimants recognised at the April Hearing, if there had been individual claims pleaded by 30,000 named plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Complaint, that pleading would not have been a diffuse claim barred by the 1995 Settlement Agreement.54\n\nD2,482-483 (Mr Bloom).\n\nD2,374 (Mr Coriell).\n\n166.\n\nIt is necessary, in these ambiguous circumstances, to look further between the lines of the pleading in the Lago Agrio Complaint, assessed at the time of its filing before the Lago Agrio Court. The questions posed by the Parties' cases raise several important distinctions between a party's standing to bring a claim, the cause of action alleged by a party and the substantive nature of the right invoked by a party. In the Tribunal's view, the answer to these questions lies not in the formal standing of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs but rather with the alleged causes of action and (if and to the extent different) the substantive nature of the alleged rights invoked by those plaintiffs, to be assessed more as a matter of substance than strict form.\n\n167.\n\nFor present purposes, it is appropriate to focus upon relatively few of the Parties' oral and written submissions in Track 1B. For the Respondent, the most significant submissions were based upon the appellate decision of 2002 by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court in the environmental case known as *Delfina,* in legal proceedings preceding and unconnected with the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Parties' dispute. (Unlike the judgments in the Lago Agrio case, the Claimants do not seek to impugn the Supreme Court's decision in *Delfina* on grounds of any impropriety or denial of justice).\n\n168.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the decision in ***Delfina*** throws some but not decisive light on the causes of action pleaded and the rights invoked in the Lago Agrio Complaint. ***Delfina*** was not a diffuse case. Yet, the plaintiff in ***Delfina*** did not claim individualised damages but, rather, non-monetary relief in the form of remedial works that would benefit all the members of the affected community of which the plaintiff was also a member. That form of relief did not, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, convert what was otherwise an individual claim into a diffuse claim. Moreover, the Environmental Management Act 1999 did not play any part in the Supreme Court's analysis of that claim. Accordingly, in the Tribunal's view, as pleaded in the Lago Agrio Complaint, Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act could not by itself convert what was otherwise an individual claim into a diffuse claim.\n\n169.\n\nIt is however necessary to analyse exactly what was decided, for present purposes, by the Supreme Court in *Delfina*. The issue principally addressed by the Supreme Court was whether the plaintiff's claim was: (i) a claim introduced on behalf of the private legal entity called \"Comit\u00e9 Delfina Torres Vd. De Concha\" by its legal representative, or (ii) a claim introduced on behalf of the \"people\" pursuant to \u00c4rticle 23(15) of the Ecuadorian Constitution of 1993 (but with the same relevant wording as the 1998 Constitution).55\n\n\u00c4rticle 23(15) of the 1998 Constitution provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation: \" *Sin perjuicio de los derechos establecidos en esta Constituci\u00f3n y en los instrumentos* *internacionales vigentes, el Estado reconocer\u00e1 y garantizar\u00e1 a las personas los siguientes : (...) 15. El derecho a dirigir quejas y peticiones a las autoridades, pero en ning\u00fan caso en nombre del pueblo; y a recibir la atenci\u00f3n o las respuestas pertinentes, en el plazo adecuado.* \" (\"Without prejudice to the rights established in the Constitution and the international instruments currently in force, the State recognizes and guarantees the following to the people:... 15. The right to file complaints and petitions to the authorities, but under no circumstances on behalf of the people, and to receive attention or relevant responses within an appropriate period.\").\n\n170.\n\nIn its \"Fifth\" finding, the Supreme Court decided that the claim was not validly introduced on the basis of \u00c4rticle 23(15) of the Constitution, which does not refer to the right to introduce a legal claim before a court of law administering justice in accordance with due process. It refers only to the right of individuals to formulate requests or complaints addressed to administrative authorities, something (as this constitutional provision dictates) that an individual can do on his or her own behalf, but never on behalf of the \"people\" (the original Spanish term is \"pueblo\", which has been mistranslated in the English text produced by the Respondent as \"public interest\": see above).\n\n171.\n\n\u00c4ccordingly, the Supreme Court decided that \u00c4rticle 23(15) of the Constitution did not confer a right to introduce a legal action before the Respondent's judiciary (be it individual, diffuse or whatever), but rather a right, as the Supreme Court states, having a \"political administrative nature\" exercised before the public administration. In the exercise of such a right, an individual could not act as the representative of the \"people\" because such people's rights can only be exercised by or on behalf the people's constitutional representatives, i.e. the legislative and executive organs of the State; and an individual cannot usurp the exercise of those rights belonging to the people because it would undermine the constitutional organisation of the State.\n\n172.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, by rejecting such a claim by the plaintiff in *Delfina,* as being incorrectly pleaded under \u00c4rticle 23(15), the Supreme Court was not deciding whether or not a diffuse claim could be pleaded under Ecuadorian law. In short, the issue before this Tribunal (as to whether individuals or groups of individuals could plead legal claims that may be characterised as diffuse claims) was neither raised nor decided in the *Delfina* case. Therefore, at its highest, it can only be said that the Supreme Court did not reject the possibility of an Ecuadorian court of law accepting and entertaining a diffuse claim by an individual or private group of individuals.\n\n173.\n\nThe Supreme Court did admit the plaintiff's claim as a claim made on behalf of the \"Comit\u00e9 Delfina Torres Vda. De Concha\" by its authorised legal representative, namely the plaintiff. This latter claim was treated as an individual claim, i.e. a claim filed on behalf of an individual that was not a physical, but a legal person comprising 250 families living on 25 hectares of land. In the Tribunal's view, this factor may differentiate the **Delfina** complaint from certain claims pleaded in the Lago Agrio complaint. The latter claims were not pleaded by any authorised entity representing a narrowly defined community or a group of people. On the other hand, the complaint in **Delfina** pleaded that the harm suffered by this defined community also affected the Esmeralda Province and interested the entire Ecuadorian nation.56 That allegation of generalised harm did not affect the Supreme Court's characterisation of the claim as an individual claim.\n\nThe *Delfina* Complaint (R-1188).\n\n174.\n\nAs to the relief claimed and admitted in *Delfina*, the plaintiffs sought compensation from the defendants' wrongdoing. In its \"Twentieth\" finding, the Supreme Court concluded that the standard to be applied is objective responsibility for the injury caused by the defendants, with the defendants bearing the burden of proving that they did not cause the injury; and that liability for such injury may lead to pecuniary compensation, reparation in kind or both. In its \"Twenty-Seventh\" finding, the Supreme Court admitted compensation in the form of certain remedial works \"for the benefit of the community\". In other words, the Supreme Court decided in favour of reparation in kind in lieu of pecuniary compensation. This did not change the nature of the claim, as an individual claim. This appears clearly in the third paragraph of the Supreme Court's Clarification of 29 October 2012, where the Court: (i) acknowledges that the normal relief for the injury suffered by the plaintiffs is pecuniary compensation; (ii) that such pecuniary compensation due to the plaintiffs (but no other person) amounted to US$ 11,000,000.00; and (iii) in view of the desire expressed by the plaintiffs, such amount was to be applied to remedial works to satisfy the needs of the community. It is clear, however, that the cost of such works was not to exceed the amount of US$ 11,000,000.00. That generalised form of remedial relief benefiting the community as a whole did not affect the Supreme Court's characterisation of the claim as an individual claim.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the submissions made by the Respondent at the April Hearing to the effect that the Supreme Court's judgment in *Delfina* decisively determines this Issue (ii) in Track 1B in favour of the Respondent and against the Claimants. On the other hand, on the basis of this judgment, the Tribunal does accept, rejecting the Claimants' submissions, that a plaintiff's pleading in regard to the broad scope of environmental harm caused by a defendant's wrongdoing and a claim for relief in the form of remedial works did not, by themselves, affect the characterisation of a claim as an individual claim under Ecuadorian law.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts that the line between an individual claim and a diffuse claim can be finely drawn in regard to delictual liability for environmental pollution. The same is true for such delictual claims elsewhere. It can be unhelpful sometimes to address an issue under one legal system by reference to another, given dissimilarities in language, legal culture and historical traditions. In this case, however, the Tribunal is an international tribunal not bound by technical pleading formalities; and it has necessarily to compare the material substance of the Aguinda Complaint with the material substance of the Lago Agrio Complaint. It does so here by reference to the former's claim for the common law tort of public nuisance under the laws of the USA. Ordinarily, in common law systems, public nuisance cannot found a claim by a private individual, but only a claim by a public authority.\n\n177.\n\nAs already described above, it is common ground between the Parties that the Aguinda Plaintiffs brought their claim for public nuisance as individual claims (as members of a class) and not as a diffuse claim under the laws of the USA. Further, as already indicated, it could not be argued (nor is it) that the 1995 Settlement Agreement barred the making in Lago Agrio of an individual claim under Ecuadorian law materially similar, in substance, to the claim in New York for public nuisance.\n\n178.\n\nUnder New York law, it is well settled that an unaffected person can make no claim in public nuisance: that claim can only be made by a public authority and not private individuals. An individual plaintiff advancing an individual claim must plead special damage from the injury caused by the public nuisance. As was decided by the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department of New York in *Leo v General Electric* (1989), an environmental pollution case:57\n\n*\"Pollution of navigable waters which causes death to or contamination of fish constitutes a public nuisance.... It is settled law in this state [New York] that, in the absence of special damage, a public nuisance is subject to correction only by a public authority.... [citations omitted]: \u2018It is equally clear, however, that one who suffers damage or injury, beyond the general inconvenience to the public at large, may recover for such nuisance damages or obtain [an] injunction to prevent its continuance. This is old law'... If there is some injury peculiar to a plaintiff, a private action premised on a public nuisance may be maintained [page 3]... \"*\n\n*\"It cannot be gainsaid that profound damage common to the entire community has been caused by the pollution of our waters. However, assuming the allegation of the complaint to be true, as we must on a motion to dismiss, the breadth and depth of the tragedy do not preclude a determination that a peculiar or special harm has also been done to these plaintiffs: diminution or loss of livelihood is not* *suffered by every person who fishes in the Hudson River or waters of Long Island* *...; the harm alleged is peculiar to the individual plaintiffs in their capacity as commercial fisherman and goes beyond the harm done to them as members of the community at large [page 4]...\"*\n\n*Leo v General Electric* 145 A.D. 2d 291, 583 N.Y.S.2d 844 [RLA-527].\n\n179.\n\nIt is self-evident that the Aguinda Plaintiffs could not simplistically convert their individual claims for special damage in public nuisance under the laws of the USA to identical claims in the Lago Agrio Complaint under Ecuadorian law as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. The same follows for other individual claims pleaded in their Aguinda Complaint.\n\n180.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, certain pleaded claims in the Lago Agrio Complaint could be understood as converting these individual claims under New York law and procedure into individual claims under Ecuadorian law and procedure. To this partial extent, the Lago Agrio Complaint was a re-statement, in substance, of the same case pleaded by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York. Albeit not as a matter of res judicata or issue estoppel, the Tribunal notes the similar observation made long ago by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit: \"Chevron's contention that the Lago Agrio litigation is not the refiled Aguinda action is without merit. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are substantially the same as those who brought the suit in the Southern District of New York, and the claims now being asserted in Lago Agrio are the Ecuadorian equivalent of those dismissed on forum conveniens grounds.\"58\n\nR-247, page 7, footnote 5.\n\n181.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Lago Agrio Complaint includes claims materially equivalent, in substance, to the individual claims pleaded in the Aguinda Complaint; and that these claims were pleaded in the Lago Agrio Complaint as individual claims under Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal also concludes that the claimed relief in the form of remedial works in the Lago Agrio Complaint and its pleaded reference to Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act did not convert, by themselves, these individual claims into diffuse claims under Ecuadorian law.\n\n182.\n\nFurther, however, the Tribunal does not here exclude the possibility that the Lago Agrio Complaint also included other claims that could be understood as diffuse claims, depending upon their subsequent treatment by the Ecuadorian Courts following the filing of the Lago Agrio Complaint.\n\n183.\n\n*Conclusion:* Accordingly, to the simple question posed above, the Tribunal decides that Lago Agrio Complaint, as originally filed, does include individual claims and cannot be read (as the Claimants assert and the Respondent denies) as pleading \"exclusively\" or \"only diffuse claims\". To this extent, the Claimants' reliance on the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a complete bar to the Lago Agrio Complaint at inception must fail in limine, as a matter of Ecuadorian law (being the law applicable to the 1995 Settlement Agreement). At this point, however, the Tribunal must suspend its further analysis for the reasons already described above, given that the Tribunal does not think it right by this decision in Track 1B of this arbitration to consider the subsequent conduct of the Lago Agrio Court, the Appellate Court of Lago Agrio and the Cassation Court in regard to their actual treatment of the Lago Agrio Complaint, being all matters scheduled for Track 2.\n\n184.\n\nGiven the limited scope and form of this decision, the Tribunal also does not think it right to address further here the specific relief sought by the Parties set out in Part B above, including issues on costs and certain procedural applications; and all such issues are necessarily put off to one or more later orders, decisions or awards by the Tribunal.\n\n185.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal decides to make these decisions as an interim decision and not as any form of \"award\" under the USA-Ecuador BIT, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or the law of the Netherlands (as the lex loci arbitri).\n\n***PART E: DECISION***\n----------------------\n\n186.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, as regards the said Issue (ii) in Track 1B of this arbitration, the Tribunal decides (but does not award) that:\n\n(1) The Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as an initial pleading, included individual claims resting upon individual rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as invoked by the Claimants);\n\n(2) The Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by res judicata, under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as invoked by the Claimants); and\n\n(3) The Lago Agrio Complaint included individual claims materially similar, in substance, to the individual claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York.\n\n187.\n\nNo other part of the Parties' claimed relief in Track 1B is here decided by the Tribunal; and the Tribunal retains in full its jurisdiction and powers to address and decide such relief (including costs) by one or more further orders, decisions or awards at a later stage of these arbitration proceedings."}, {"Title": "Second Partial Award on Track II", "Type": "Award (Partial)", "Date": "2018-08-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Second Partial Award on Track II\n--------------------------------\n\n***A: SELECTED ABBREVIATIONS***\n-------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Aguinda Litigation* | Litigation initiated by complaint filed by Mar\u00eda Aguinda and others against Texaco before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, USA on 3 November 1993. |\n| *April Hearing* | Hearing on Track I(b) held on 28-29 April 2014. |\n| *Chevron* | The First Claimant, Chevron Corporation, a legal person organised under the laws of the USA. |\n| *February Hearing* | Hearing on interim measures held on 11 February 2012. |\n| *Jurisdiction Hearing* | Hearing on jurisdiction held on 22-23 November 2010. |\n| *Lago Agrio Litigation* | Litigation initiated by \u00c1ngel Piaguage and others against Chevron by a complaint (the \"Lago Agrio Complaint\") filed before the Superior Court of Justice of Nueva Loja in Ecuador (the \"Lago Agrio Court\") on 7 May 2003.

Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement.*\"\n\n(For ease of reference, these terms cited from Article VI of the Treaty, with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976), are herein collectively called the \"Arbitration Agreement\").\n\n1.12.\n\nPursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the Treaty (cited above), the Arbitration Agreement incorporates the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) (the \"UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\").\n\n1.13.\n\nPursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, these arbitration proceedings are deemed to have commenced on 29 September 2009.\n\n1.14.\n\nBy agreement of the Parties (as confirmed by the Tribunal's Agreed Procedural Order No 1), the place (or legal seat) of this arbitration is The Hague, the Netherlands within the meaning of Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Netherlands is a Contracting State to the 1958 New York Convention.\n\n1.15.\n\nBy further agreement of the Parties (as also confirmed by the Tribunal's Agreed Procedural Order No 1), English and Spanish are the official languages of this arbitration within the meaning of Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; and, as between them, English is to be the authoritative language, with all oral proceedings to be simultaneously interpreted and transcribed into English and Spanish.\n\n***C: The Arbitral Tribunal***\n------------------------------\n\n1.16.\n\nPursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal is comprised of three arbitrators appointed thereunder as follows:\n\n*\\* Dr Grigera Na\u00f3n* : In their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, the Claimants notified the Respondent of their appointment as co-arbitrator of Dr Horacio A. Grigera Na\u00f3n, of 5224 Elliott Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20816, United States of America.\n\n*\\* Professor Lowe* : On 4 December 2009, the Respondent notified the Claimants of its appointment as co-arbitrator of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.\n\n*\\* Mr Veeder* : By email of 22 January 2010, the Claimants informed the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") that the two co-arbitrators were unable to agree on the appointment of the presiding third arbitrator. Pursuant to the agreement between the Parties concerning the selection of the presiding third arbitrator, the PCA was requested to act as appointing authority and \"if the party appointed arbitrators cannot agree on the President by Jan. 22 [2010], then the PCA will appoint the President but only after the PCA provides the parties an opportunity to comment on the candidate under consideration by the PCA.\" Accordingly, on 25 February 2010 and in accordance with the Parties' agreement, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed as the presiding arbitrator Mr V.V. Veeder, of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.\n\n(Professor Lowe and Mr Veeder are individual members of the English Bar. As such, albeit from the same barristers' chambers, they practise as arbitrators independently from each other, as disclosed by Mr Veeder in his Declaration of Acceptance and Statement of Impartiality and Independence dated 26 January 2010).\n\n1.17.\n\nBy further agreement of the Parties, the PCA's International Bureau was appointed to administer these arbitration proceedings, with Mr Martin Doe (of the PCA) acting as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n1.18.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 32 dated 26 March 2015, by consent of the Parties and upon the terms set out, the Tribunal appointed Ms Jessica Wells as an additional Secretary to the Tribunal in this arbitration.\n\n***D: The Arbitral Procedure***\n-------------------------------\n\n1.19.\n\n*Earlier Orders, Decision and Awards in Tracks 1 and 1B* : This Award follows three Orders on Interim Measures, five Awards, a Decision, and more than 57 procedural orders made in these arbitration proceedings. The operative parts of these Orders on Interim Measures, Awards and Decision are cited below in Annex 1 to this Part I. The Tribunal's Procedural Orders relevant to Track II are listed below in Annex 2 to this Part I.\n\n1.20.\n\nThis Award is made in Track II of this arbitration, following Track I and Track Ib. It serves no purpose to revisit here the full procedural history of these arbitration proceedings from February 2010. For simplicity's sake, the Tribunal hereby incorporates by reference Part I of its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction, Part A of its First Partial Award on Track I and Part B of its Decision on Track IB. It here includes only a summary of the major procedural events following the Tribunal's Decision on Track IB dated 12 March 2015 (the \"Decision on Track IB\").\n\n1.21.\n\n*Orders for Interim Measures, Awards and Decision* : As already indicated, the operative parts of the Tribunal's three Orders for Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010, 6 December 2010 and 7 February 2011, its five Awards dated 25 January 2012, 16 February 2012, 27 February 2012, 7 February 2013, 17 September 2013 and its Decision dated 12 March 2015 are cited below in Annex 1 to this Part 1.\n\n1.22.\n\n*Track II Procedure:* The Tribunal issued its Decision on Track IB on 12 March 2015. The Tribunal there decided (by a majority), in the form of a decision under the Arbitration Agreement: that (i) the Complaint dated 7 May 2003 of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, as an initial pleading, included individual claims resting upon individual rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as diffuse claims; (ii) the Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by *res judicata* under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and (iii) the Lago Agrio Complaint included individual claims materially similar, in substance, to the individual claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in the Part I \u2013 Page 6 Aguinda Litigation in New York. The Tribunal expressly reserved its powers to address and decide the remainder of the Parties' claimed relief in Track IB by one or more further orders, decisions or awards at a later stage of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n1.23.\n\nOn 12 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 29 and 30. In Procedural Order No. 29, the Tribunal ordered (by consent of the Parties) an amendment to the Confidentiality Clause forming part of Procedural Order No. 26 so as to exclude from confidentiality certain passages addressing the results of the joint inspection of Judge Zambrano's computer hard drives in the Parties' respective memorials of 7 November 2014 and 14 January 2015. In Procedural Order No. 30, the Tribunal designated four sites for the purpose of its Site Visit in Ecuador and decided upon a number of procedural matters related to the Site Visit.\n\n1.24.\n\nOn 26 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 31 and 32. In Procedural Order No. 31, the Tribunal ordered that the Parties' outside counsel and their law firms refrain from making any public statement that might aggravate the Parties' dispute. In Procedural Order No. 32, as already indicated above, the Tribunal appointed Ms Jessica Wells as an additional Secretary to the Tribunal in these arbitration proceedings.\n\n1.25.\n\nOn 27 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 33.

The Tribunal's letter to Dr Zambrano was sent to him on 1 April 2015.\n\n1.26.\n\nEarlier, on 12 May 2014, by Procedural Order No 26 and upon the terms there set out, the Tribunal appointed Ms Kathryn Owen as the Tribunal's forensic expert under the Arbitration Agreement (namely, Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules). On 30 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 34 whereby it renewed the appointment of Ms Kathryn Owen as an expert to the Tribunal.\n\n1.27.\n\nOn 7 April 2015, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting with the Parties (by telephone conference-call) to prepare for the Track II Hearing and also to address the Parties' several outstanding procedural applications. On 9 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 35. It there decided certain procedural and logistical matters relating to the Track II Hearing.\n\n1.28.\n\nOn 14 April 2015 and again on 16 April 2015, the Claimants requested \"an immediate order dissolving the confidentiality provisions of Procedural Orders No. 26 and 29 so that Claimants would be free to disclose publicly the evidence found on [Judge Zambrano's Computers' hard drives] and Mr Lynch's expert analysis of that evidence\", in response to the \"[public] leaking [of] a copy of the November 7, 2014 report of Ecuador's forensics expert, J. Christopher Racich.\" On 18 April 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it could not convene an urgent telephone conference in order to decide the Claimants' application, but requested that the Claimants notify the Tribunal if any application was made to use Mr Racich's expert report in the appellate proceedings then pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the RICO Litigation.\n\n1.29.\n\nOn 16 April 2015, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement on all aspects of the Site Visit Protocol, except for the presence of an audio/video team to be brought by each Party. On 17 April 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on the presence of an audio/video team during the Site Visit. In the event, material parts of the Tribunal's Site Visit were filmed; and the sole copy of that confidential film was lodged with the PCA for safe-keeping (where it remains as at the date of this Award).\n\n1.30.\n\nBetween 21 April 2015 and 8 May 2015, the Track II Hearing took place in Washington, DC, USA (the \"Track II Hearing\"). It is described separately below.\n\n1.31.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing, on 5 May 2015, the Tribunal circulated its Draft Procedural Order No. 36 together with the draft Site Visit Protocol. Procedural Order No. 36, formalising the Site Visit Protocol, was issued on 7 May 2015, as executed by the Parties, the Tribunal, and the Secretary-General of the PCA. Also during the Track II Hearing, on 8 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 37. It there rescinded the confidentiality clauses of Procedural Orders No. 26 and 29, save in respect of the images of Judge Zambrano's computer hard drives that were obtained by the Parties pursuant to Procedural Order No. 26.\n\n1.32.\n\nOn 4 to 10 June 2015, the Tribunal's Site Visit (accompanied by the Parties) took place in the Sucumb\u00edos and Orellana Provinces of the Oriente in Ecuador. It is described separately below.\n\n1.33.\n\nOn 18 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 38, an \"Omnibus Order\". The Tribunal there decided a number of procedural applications made by the Parties.\n\n1.34.\n\nOn 24 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 39. It there (i) addressed an application for interim measures made by the Respondent regarding USTR and US trade preference benefits; (ii) requested the Claimants to confirm the terms of the relief sought for Track I; and, as already indicated above, (iii) extended the appointment of Ms Kathryn Owen as an expert to the Tribunal in accordance with the Revised Terms of Reference therein contained (subject to further comments from the Parties). On 14 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 40. It there confirmed the Revised Terms of Reference for the extension of the appointment of Ms Owen as an expert to the Tribunal under the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n1.35.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, Ms Owen's Final Report was sent to the Parties (\"Ms Owen's Final Report\").\n\n1.36.\n\nOn 29 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 41. The Tribunal there invited the Parties' comments upon Ms Owen's Final Report. In Procedural Order No. 42, issued on 16 March 2016, the Tribunal approved and agreed to send to Ms Owen part of the documentation submitted by the Parties in response to Procedural Order No. 41.\n\n1.37.\n\nMs Owen's Revised Final Report was sent to the Parties on 3 June 2016 (\"Ms Owen's Revised Final Report\"). In Procedural Order No. 43 dated 8 June 2016, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties requested that an oral hearing be held for the Parties to question Ms Owen and make submissions on her report under the Arbitration Agreement (namely, Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules). By letters dated 10 June and 17 June 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively stated that they did not request any hearing on Ms Owen's report under the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n1.38.\n\nOn 18 June 2016, the Respondent requested that additional materials be admitted to the evidential record under Section 4 of Procedural Order No. 41. The Claimants consented to the Respondent's request on 27 June 2016. These materials were duly admitted.\n\n1.39.\n\nOn 2 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 44. The Tribunal there recorded the agreement reached by the Parties on a number of procedural issues (as outlined in the Claimants' letter of 27 June 2016). It also ordered that the Parties make two rounds of simultaneous submissions on the significance of Ms Owen's Revised Final Report and Ms Owen's responses to the Parties' questions. The Parties did so on 12 August and 26 August 2016, respectively.\n\n1.40.\n\nOn 10 August 2016, the Claimants provided the Tribunal with a copy of the judgment dated 9 August 2016 of the Second Circuit in the RICO Litigation (the \"Judgment of the Second Circuit\"). On 16 August 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Judgment of the Second Circuit. On 18 August 2016, the Claimants submitted further comments on the Judgment of the Second Circuit. On 29 August 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 45. The Tribunal there admitted the Judgment of the Second Circuit into the evidential record. It also noted that there could be no issue estoppel or *res judicata* applicable to the arbitration proceedings arising from the RICO Litigation, *inter alia*, for want of sufficient privity under international law between the Parties; and that the Parties had agreed that evidence adduced before the US Courts in the RICO Litigation, as filed in this arbitration with the Tribunal's approval, was to be treated as evidence adduced in this arbitration.\n\n1.41.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit a copy of an *amicus* brief submitted by Ecuador to the Second Circuit in the RICO Litigation (the \"RICO Amicus Brief\"). The Claimants provided this RICO Amicus Brief on 30 August 2016.\n\n1.42.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, the Respondent submitted certain comments in relation to the RICO Amicus Brief and Procedural Order No. 45, noting \"that the Tribunal has admitted evidence from those [USA] proceedings as it was submitted by the parties in their respective briefs and memorials\"; and that certain FTP materials (exceeding 18.3 GB) proffered by the Claimants on 23 December 2013 had not been admitted by the Tribunal with its approval into the arbitration's evidential record.\n\n1.43.\n\nOn 19 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 46, whereby *(inter alia)* the Tribunal decided not to hold an oral hearing to question Ms Owen in connection with her Revised Final Report under the Arbitration Agreement. It also Part I \u2013 Page 10 confirmed the Respondent's understanding regarding the Claimants' FTP materials, as expressed in the Respondent's letter dated 31 August 2016.\n\n1.44.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the US Supreme Court had issued a decision in the RICO Litigation (the \"Supreme Court's Decision\"). On 27 June 2017, the Tribunal requested a copy of the Supreme Court's Decision, which the Claimants provided on 29 June 2017.\n\n1.45.\n\nOn 12 July 2017, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal terminate the orders made in its First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards. On 19 July 2017, the Claimants requested that these orders remain in force. On 21 July 2017, the Tribunal requested that the Parties respond to a series of queries by the Tribunal in connection with their respective applications regarding these Awards. It also requested a copy of the judgment of The Hague Court of Appeal of 18 July 2017, denying the Respondent's appeal seeking to set aside the Tribunal's Awards (the \"Judgment of The Hague Court of Appeal\"). On 25 July 2017, the Claimants provided a copy of the Judgment of The Hague Court of Appeal. On 1 August 2017, the Parties provided their respective written responses to the Tribunal's queries of 21 July 2017. On 31 October 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 47, whereby it dismissed the Respondent's application of 12 July 2017 and confirmed that its First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards remained in full force and effect.\n\n1.46.\n\nOn 5 February 2018, the Tribunal requested that the Parties provide it with certain additional information regarding the status of the related legal proceedings and identify which parts of their respective prayers for relief from the outset of the arbitration remained extant for Track II and Track III. The Tribunal otherwise advised the Parties that it was approaching the end of its deliberations and intended formally to \"close the hearings\" under Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules as regards all issues to be addressed in its award under Track II. On 19 March and 20 April 2018 the Parties provided their respective comments to the Tribunal's letter of 5 February 2018. On 23 April 2018, the Claimants requested the Tribunal's permission to respond to the Respondent's letter of 20 April 2018, which the Tribunal denied on 25 April 2018. On 30 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 48, whereby it declared the record closed under Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules as regards all issues to be addressed by the Tribunal in its Track II award.\n\n1.47.\n\n*Written Pleadings:* Pursuant to the Tribunal's procedural orders, the Parties submitted the following written pleadings during or relevant to Track II (in addition to other written pleadings under Track I, Ib and III):\n\n(i) The Claimants' Notice of Arbitration, dated 23 September 2009 (\"C-NoA Sept. 2009\");\n\n(ii) The Claimants' Request for Interim Measures, dated 1 April 2010 (\"C-IM Apr. 2010\");\n\n(iii) The Respondent's Response to Claimants' Request for Interim Measures dated 3 May 2010 (\"R-IM May 2010\");\n\n(iv) The Respondent's Summary Description of its Preliminary Jurisdictional and Admissibility Objections dated 3 May 2010 (\"R-Jur.

At the Tribunal's request, confirmed by the Tribunal's Agreed Procedural Order of 19 July 2018, the Parties made their respective written submissions on the Constitutional Court's Judgment by letters dated 25 July 2018. Subsequently, prior to the issue of this Award, the Tribunal re-closed the record of this arbitration as regards the issues under Track II that are decided in this Award, by Procedural Order No. 50 and letter dated 13 August 2018.\n\nC-2551.\n\nC-931.\n\nC-991.\n\nC-1975.\n\n***PART II** - **THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES***\n----------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n2.1.\n\nThe several claims made by the Claimants and the several responses made by the Respondent in this arbitration are recorded in their respective pleaded requests for relief. These pleadings are fully set out in Annex 3 to Part I of this Award, above. As there formulated, these comprise a range of specific requests, reflecting the particular facts of the Parties' dispute arising from the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Judgments of the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation (National) Court and the Constitutional Court of the Respondent.\n\n2.2.\n\nThese facts were first pleaded in the Claimants' Notice of Arbitration of 23 September 2009 and disputed by the Respondent's initial pleading of 3 May 2010, during the pendency of the Lago Agrio Litigation (begun in 2003) but before the Judgments of the Lago Agrio Court (2011), the Lago Agrio Appellate Court (2012), the Cassation Court (2013) and the Constitutional Court (2018). As the Parties' dispute continued and deepened from 2009 onwards, after the commencement of this arbitration, the Parties' respective pleadings have correspondingly developed to take account of these new and other events, up to 25 July 2018.\n\n2.3.\n\nThese disputed facts and requests are, however, all focused on the overall dispute that lay and continues to lie at the heart of this case between the Claimants and the Respondent.\n\n2.4.\n\nIn brief, the Claimants assert that TexPet (with Texaco) made an investment in the form of an oil concession in the Oriente, Ecuador (beginning in 1964); that this investment was subsequently acquired by Chevron when it \"merged\" with Texaco and acquired TexPet, as Texaco's subsidiary (in 2001); that the Respondent agreed (in 1995-1998) on the extent of the responsibility of TexPet, Texaco and subsequently Chevron for clean-up operations and on the extent of their residual liability for environmental harm in the concession area; that, in breach of that agreement, the Respondent facilitated legal proceedings by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the form of the Lago Agrio Litigation Part II \u2013 Page 1 against Chevron; that such proceedings were subject to procedural fraud and judicial misconduct by judges of the Lago Agrio Court; that the Lago Agrio Judgment was 'ghostwritten' by representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in corrupt collusion with the presiding judge of the Lago Agrio Court; that the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court left such fraud, misconduct and corruption unremedied; that the Lago Agrio Appellate Court rendered enforceable the Lago Agrio Judgment, within and without Ecuador (in 2012); and that the Respondent (by its judicial branch, aided and abetted by its executive branch) failed to provide to both Chevron and TexPet the legal protections to which they were entitled in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n2.5.\n\nThe Claimants (as USA nationals) contend that these facts disclose multiple breaches by the Respondent of their rights under the Treaty (including customary international law); that many of these breaches have a continuing character that was renewed, repeated and maintained in successive factual developments; and that these international wrongs have caused and are still causing injuries to each of them; and that the Claimants (particularly Chevron) became and remain exposed to potentially disastrous legal proceedings for the enforcement of the corrupt Lago Agrio Judgment in multiple jurisdictions, not limited to Ecuador or the USA.\n\n2.6.\n\nThe Claimants contend that these breaches of the Treaty are rooted in: (i) the failure of the Respondent to give effect to the agreements made by the Respondent concerning the responsibility and residual liability for environmental damage (collectively, the \"1995 Settlement Agreement\"); (ii) the issuing, rendering enforceable and maintaining the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment (as varied by the Cassation Court); and (iii) the failure of the Respondent to take effective steps to address and remedy the procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n2.7.\n\nThe Claimants assert that this Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Treaty to decide their claims; and, also, that their claims are admissible in this arbitration under the Treaty.\n\n2.8.\n\nIn brief, the Respondent denies: (i) that Chevron has, or has had, any investment in Ecuador relevant to the Treaty; (ii) that this Tribunal has any jurisdiction to address the Claimants' claims under the Treaty; (iii) that the Claimants' claims are admissible in Part II \u2013 Page 2 this arbitration under the Treaty; and (iv) that the Claimants' cases, on their merits, entitle either of them to any of the relief which they claim in this arbitration.\n\n2.9.\n\nIn this arbitration, the procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and corruption in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment (as alleged by the Claimants and denied by the Respondent), taken together, were commonly referred to by the Parties as a 'denial of justice'. The Tribunal is content to adopt that usage. In doing so, however, the Tribunal draws attention to the fact that its mandate in this arbitration is focused on the question of alleged breaches of the Treaty (including customary international law). The Treaty does not make express provision for denial of justice.\n\n2.10.\n\nThe principal issues to be addressed by the Tribunal in this Award, under Track II of this arbitration, are whether the Tribunal has any jurisdiction over Chevron's claims under the Treaty; (if so) whether such claims are admissible under the Treaty; if so, whether any alleged conduct attributable to the Respondent amounts to a violation of the Treaty (including customary international law); if and to the extent that these questions are answered affirmatively, to what forms of relief are Chevron and TexPet entitled under the Treaty (including customary international law); and, in any event, to what forms of relief is the Respondent entitled under the Treaty (including, again, customary international law).\n\n2.11.\n\nThese principal issues subsume a mass of lesser factual, expert, forensic and legal issues. For the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal has addressed these issues in the several Parts that follow. For ease of reference, the subject-matters of these different Parts are described below.\n\n2.12.\n\nThe Tribunal does not here revisit its determinations made in its earlier awards, orders and decision. This Award is limited to issues arising in Track II of this Arbitration, as identified by the Parties up to 25 July 2018. Thus, this Award does not address issues already decided in Tracks 1 and 1B or still to be addressed in Track III of this arbitration. Moreover, the Tribunal has not thought it necessary to decide all the issues listed for Track II by the Parties.\n\n***B: The Principal Legal and Other Texts \u2013 Part III***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.13.\n\nFor ease of later reference in this Award, Part III of this Award sets out, verbatim, relevant texts from the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (forming part of the Parties' Arbitration Agreement derived from the Treaty), the 1995-1998 Settlement and Release Agreements, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the 1985 UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the 1998 Ecuadorian Constitution, the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Ecuadorian Environmental Management Act 1999 and the Ecuadorian Collusion Prosecution Act.\n\n2.14.\n\nThe full text of the Treaty (in English and Spanish) is appended to Part I, as Annex 5.\n\n***C: The Facts and Other Matters \u2013 Parts IV and V***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n2.15.\n\n*Part IV* of this Award sets out the facts and other matters, including the non-computer expert evidence, relevant to the Tribunal's decisions in this Award.

It was also signed by a senior officer of PetroEcuador and two representatives of TexPet (now, but not then, indirectly owned by Chevron): Dr Ricardo Reis Veiga and Mr Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Pallares.\n\n3.18.\n\nThe 1995 Settlement Agreement provided in the final two paragraphs of its preamble that TexPet agreed to undertake the \"Environmental Remedial Work in consideration for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations.\" By Article 1.3, the term \"Environmental Impact\" included: \"[a]ny solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present or released into the environment in such concentration or condition, the presence or release of which causes, or has the potential to cause harm to human health or the environment.\"\n\n3.19.\n\nAs contemplated in the earlier 1994 MOU between the same signatory parties (which was to be substituted and become void by Article 9.6 and the last paragraph of Annex \"A\" of the 1995 Settlement Agreement), the 1995 Settlement Agreement, subject to its terms: (i) released TexPet from the Respondent's and PetroEcuador's claims based upon Environmental Impact (except for claims related to TexPet's performance of the Scope of Work); and (ii) provided that TexPet would be released from all remaining environmental liability upon completion of the remediation obligations described in that Scope of Work.\n\n3.20.\n\nArticle 1.12 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement defined such release, as follows:\n\n*\"The release, under the provisions of Article V of this Contract, of all legal and contractual obligations and liability, towards the Government and Petroecuador, for the Environmental Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium, including any claims that the Government and Petroecuador have, or may have against Texpet, arising out of the Consortium Agreements.\"*\n\n3.21.\n\nThe term \"Operations of the Consortium\" was defined as \"Those oil exploration and production operations carried out under the Consortium Agreement\", i.e. the 1973 Concession Agreement.\n\n3.22.\n\nArticle 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (\"Article V\") provides (inter alia), in material part:\n\n*\"On the execution date of this Contract [i.e. 4 May 1995], and in consideration of Texpet's agreement to perform the Environmental Remedial Work in accordance with the Scope of Work set out in Annex A, and the Remedial Action Plan, the Government and Petroecuador shall hereby release, acquit and forever discharge Texpet, Texaco Petroleum Company, Compa\u00f1ia Texaco de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador, S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees, officers, directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs, administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals and subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as 'the Releasees') of all the Government's and Petroecuador's claims against the Releasees for Environmental Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium, except for those related to the obligations contracted hereunder for the performance by Texpet of the Scope of Work (Annex A) \u2026\"*\n\n3.23.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Government's \"claims\" were addressed in Article 5.2. It provides:\n\n*\"The Government and Petroecuador intend claims to mean any and all claims, rights to Claims, debts, liens, common or civil law or equitable causes of actions and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or regulatory causes of action and penalties (including, but not limited to, causes of action under Article 19-2 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador, Decree No. 1459 of 1971, Decree No. 925 of 1973, the Water Act, R.O. 233 of 1973, ORO No. 530 of 1974, Decree No. 374 of 1976, Decree No. 101 of 1982, or Decree No. 2144 of 1989, or any other applicable law or regulation of the Republic of Ecuador), costs, lawsuits, settlements and attorneys' fees (past, present, future, known or unknown), that the Government or Petroecuador have, or ever may have against each Releasee for or in any way related to contamination, that have or ever may arise in the future, directly or indirectly arising out of Operations of the Consortium, including but not limited to consequences of all types of injury that the Government or Petroecuador may allege concerning persons, properties, business, reputations, and all other types of injuries that may be measured in money, including but not limited to, trespass, nuisance, negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, or any other theory or potential theory of recovery.\"*\n\n3.24.\n\nThe reference in Article 5.2 to Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution (being the 1978 Constitution effective in 1979 and, as later amended, in force in 1995) signified a cause of action available to the Respondent under Title II, Section 1 (On the Rights of People/Individuals)2 whereby the Ecuadorian State guaranteed to each person, inter alia (in English translation): \"\u2026 the right to live in an environment that is free from contamination. It is the duty of the State to ensure that this right is not negatively affected and to foster the preservation of nature \u2026\". The reference to Decree No. 374 of 1976 signified a cause of action available to the Respondent on the prevention and control of pollution. The reference to the Water Act of 1973 and Decree No. 2144 of 1989 signified causes of action available to the Respondent in regard to water resources and water contamination. The reference to ORO No 530 signified the Regulations for the Exploration and Exploration of Hydrocarbons of 9 April 1974.\n\nAs recorded in the Tribunal's First Partial Award, the Claimants translate the Spanish term \"las personas\" as \"people\" or \"persons\"; and the Respondent as \"individuals\" and \"persons\". For present purposes, the difference is immaterial.\n\n3.25.\n\n(ii) *The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases* : As provided by Annex \"A\" to the Settlement Agreement, TexPet subsequently settled disputes with the four municipalities of the Oriente Region (Sushufindi, Francisco de Orellana (Coca), Lago Agrio and Loya de los Sachas), under written agreements made with these municipalities, as also the Province of Sucumb\u00edos and the Napo consortium of municipalities (the \"1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases\").\n\n3.26.\n\nUnder these six settlements, four of which were approved by the Ecuadorian Courts owing to their nature as extant litigious disputes, TexPet, together with non-signatory parties, were released from liability to these municipalities for the Consortium's activities in the area of the concession. The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases provided (inter alia) for releases in somewhat different terms from Article 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n3.27.\n\n(iii) *The 1998 Final Release* : On 30 September 1998, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Respondent (acting by its Minister of Energy and Mines), PetroEcuador, PetroProduccion and TexPet executed the \"Acta Final\" (or Final Release), certifying that TexPet had performed all its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and, in accordance with its terms, releasing TexPet from (as specified) any environmental liability arising from the Consortium's operations.\n\n3.28.\n\nArticle IV of the Final Release provided (inter alia) in material part as follows:\n\n*\" \u2026 The Government and PetroEcuador proceed to release, absolve and discharge TexPet, Texas Petroleum Company, Compa\u00f1ia Texaco de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador, S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees, officers, directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs, administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals, subsidiaries forever, from any liability and claims by the Government of the Republic of Ecuador, PetroEcuador and its Affiliates, for items related to the obligations assumed by TexPet in the aforementioned Contract [the 1995 Settlement Agreement] \u2026.\"*\n\n3.29.\n\nThe wording of the release in Article IV of the Final Release is materially the same linguistically as the wording Article 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n***E: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n3.30.\n\n*Article 10* : Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads as follows:\n\n*\"Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.\"*\n\n***F: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.31.\n\n*Article 2* : Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides as follows:\n\n*\"1.

The Tribunal considers, in particular, the Claimants' allegation that Judge Zambrano did not write the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011 (with its Clarification Order of 4 March 2011); but, rather, that the Lago Agrio Judgment was 'ghostwritten', with Judge Zambrano's corrupt connivance, by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives.1 In addition, the Tribunal considers the Claimants' allegations that the Respondent's Government improperly intervened in the Lago Agrio Litigation, also in breach of the protections provided to the Claimants by the Treaty.\n\nC-931, C-1367 & R-1193.\n\n4.2.\n\nThese allegations are denied by the Respondent.\n\n4.3.\n\nIn this Part IV, as already indicated, the Tribunal addresses the evidence relevant to the issues regarding the alleged judicial misconduct, improper intervention by the Government and the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment. In Part V, the Tribunal addresses specific aspects of the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011, the Lago Agrio Appellate Judgment of 3 January 2012,2 the Cassation Court Judgment of 12 November 20133 and the Constitutional Court Judgment of 27 June 2018.4 In Part VI, the Tribunal considers separately the forensic computer evidence adduced by the Parties' forensic expert witnesses in support of their respective cases as to the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment, including earlier orders issued by Judge Zambrano.\n\nC-991 (see also the Clarification Order of 13 January 2012, C-2314).\n\nC-1975.\n\nC-2551.\n\n4.4.\n\nAs regards the factual issues (including the expert and forensic issues), the Claimants bear the legal burden of proving the facts upon which they rely to support their claims, under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.5 Whilst the evidential burden may shift from one side to the other depending on the evidence, it remains always for the Claimants to prove their positive case.\n\nThe text of Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is set out in Part III of this Award.\n\n4.5.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasises, at the outset, that the focus of its inquiry is the conduct of the Respondent acting through its judicial branch, in the form of the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court, and through its executive branch. To that inquiry, the conduct of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives is incidental, albeit relevant as part of the factual background to the conduct of the Respondent's Courts and Government.\n\n4.6.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not rely upon the judgments of the New York Courts in the RICO Litigation, to which the Respondent was not a party and which bore no legal relationship to the Treaty on which the Tribunal must rest its jurisdiction and apply, as the applicable law, international law to the Parties' dispute in this arbitration under the Treaty.\n\n***B: Evidential Sources***\n---------------------------\n\n4.7.\n\nThe evidence of relevant factual materials is extensive, complicated and much disputed, taking place over several decades. The Tribunal has preferred to rely, where it can, upon contemporary written materials, rather than upon the unsupported oral testimony of certain witnesses who testified before this Tribunal and elsewhere. However, even this explanation is incomplete, particularly as regards three individuals: (i) Dr Zambrano; (ii) Mr Steven Donziger; (ii) certain of the Lago Agrio's other representatives in Ecuador and the USA; and (iv) Dr Alberta Guerra Bastidas.\n\n4.8.\n\n*(1) Dr Zambrano:* Judge Zambrano issued procedural orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation during his two periods presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation: (i) from October 2009 to March 2010 and (ii) from October 2010 to March 2011. He also delivered the Lago Agrio Judgment and its Clarification on 14 February and 4 March 2011 respectively.6\n\nC-931, C-971.\n\n4.9.\n\nAt the procedural meeting held with the Parties on 21 January 2014, the Tribunal indicated its concern to the Parties that very serious allegations were being made in this arbitration against Dr Zambrano (by then no longer a judge) in circumstances where he might not be called as a witness by any of the Parties. In that event, Dr Zambrano would not be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Tribunal, so as to testify in response to the allegations made against him as the Judge presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation, first, from October 2009 to March 2010 and, second, from 11 October 2010 to 4 March 2011. In those circumstances the Tribunal stated that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal itself to extend an invitation to Dr Zambrano to attend, as a factual witness, the hearing then scheduled to take place at the World Bank in Washington D.C., USA from 21 April to 8 May 2015 (\"the Track II Hearing\").\n\n4.10.\n\nOn 8 December 2014, the Claimants indicated that they wished to question Dr Zambrano at the Track II Hearing and asked whether \"Ecuador would facilitate and ensure the appearance of Mr Zambrano at the hearing\u2026\". By the Claimants' subsequent list of witnesses contained in their letter dated 20 March 2015, the Claimants again confirmed their wish to question Dr Zambrano as a factual witness at the Track II Hearing. It was self-evident that the Claimants were not themselves in a position to call Dr Zambrano (being resident in Ecuador) as a witness at the Track II Hearing in the USA.\n\n4.11.\n\nBy letter dated 11 December 2014, the Office of the Attorney-General of Ecuador informed Dr Zambrano of: (i) the Tribunal's invitation to him to attend the Track II Hearing to address the allegations made against him and (ii) the Claimants' wish to question him during that Hearing. The Tribunal is satisfied that this information did reach Dr Zambrano personally; but there was no response from him to the Tribunal.\n\n4.12.\n\nOn 10 January 2015, the Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador sent a further letter repeating the Tribunal's invitation. The Tribunal is satisfied that this information also reached Dr Zambrano personally; but there was again no response from him to the Tribunal.\n\n4.13.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated 28 January 2015, the Respondent stated that Dr Zambrano was not under the control of the Respondent; that he was a part-time consultant for an Ecuadorian company (in Ecuador) in which the Government of Ecuador had an ownership interest; but that neither the Office of the Attorney General nor the Respondent's outside counsel had any relations with Dr Zambrano.\n\n4.14.\n\nThe Claimants, by letter to the Tribunal dated 9 February 2015, contended that Dr Zambrano was under the Respondent's control and that the Respondent had the power to cause Dr Zambrano to appear at the Track II Hearing as a witness. The Claimants requested the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against the Respondent in the event that Dr Zambrano should not give evidence at the Track II Hearing.\n\n4.15.\n\nAt the procedural meeting held with the Parties on 10 March 2015, the Tribunal noted that, in light of the judgment (then under appeal) of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in *Chevron Corporation v Stephen Donziger* (the \"RICO Litigation\" in New York),7 it might be thought awkward for Dr Zambrano to attend the Track II Hearing in person in the USA. If so, the Tribunal was therefore minded, as a less preferred alternative, to invite Dr Zambrano to give evidence by videolink from Ecuador. The Parties' counsel indicated that they would need to take instructions from their respective clients on this proposal. The Claimants also noted that their immediate reaction was that it would not be possible to conduct a full crossexamination by video-link, not least because it would be necessary to provide Dr Zambrano with copies of all relevant documents on which the Claimants might wish to question him.\n\nC-2135 and C-2136 (the \"RICO Judgment\").\n\n4.16.\n\nThe Tribunal understood at this time that, without more, Dr Zambrano would not be a witness at the Track II Hearing.\n\n4.17.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal re-stated to the Parties its wish to hear Dr Zambrano's factual testimony, it at all possible. For that purpose, the Tribunal confirmed its invitation to Dr Zambrano as a witness to attend the Track II Hearing in person or, if that was not possible, to participate by video link from Ecuador. The Tribunal considered that, as a matter of basic fairness, Dr Zambrano should be given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Track II Hearing as a witness (subject to questioning by the Parties and the Tribunal), so as to respond to the allegations made against him in this arbitration.\n\n4.18.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decided, as recorded in its Procedural Order No. 33 of 27 March 2015, that the Tribunal would invite Dr Zambrano itself, directly, to attend the Track II Hearing as a factual witness either (preferably) in person at the World Bank in Washington DC, USA or (in the less preferred alternative) via video-link from Ecuador from an appropriate place convenient for Dr Zambrano and the PCA. A draft of the Tribunal's proposed letter to Dr Zambrano to this effect was attached as Annex A to this Procedural Order, in Spanish and English translation, as to which the Parties' comments were invited.\n\n4.19.\n\nThe Tribunal also decided that: Dr Zambrano should be free to accept or refuse the Tribunal's invitation, as he wished, without any interference from the Parties; in the event that Dr Zambrano accepted the Tribunal's invitation to testify, the Parties should do everything in their power to facilitate his participation as a factual witness during the Track II Hearing; the reasonable costs of Dr Zambrano's participation, whether it be in person or by video-link, should be paid by the PCA out of the Parties' deposits held by the PCA; and the date(s) and format of Dr Zambrano's participation during the Track II Hearing would be specified later by the Tribunal, following consultations with Dr Zambrano and the Parties.\n\n4.20.\n\nIn the event that Dr Zambrano decided to attend the Track II Hearing via video-link only, the Tribunal decided that: the Parties should by a date to be specified later by the Tribunal (following further consultation with the Parties) compile an electronic file containing copies of any documents on which they wished to question Dr Zambrano and transmit that file to the PCA; a representative of the PCA would travel to Ecuador in order to provide Dr Zambrano with copies of the documents so identified and to provide any assistance to Dr Zambrano that he might require during the video conference; the Parties and the Tribunal could question Dr Zambrano during the video conference from the Hearing at the World Bank; no representative of any Party should be present with Dr Zambrano in Ecuador; the PCA would liaise directly with Dr Zambrano in relation to the location and other arrangements for the video conference and would ensure that all necessary logistical arrangements were in place; and the Tribunal would make a further procedural order following consultations with the Parties to regulate the procedure for the video conference.\n\n4.21.\n\nBy letter dated 1 April 2015, at the Tribunal's direction, the PCA sent the following letter to Dr Zambrano, enclosing the Tribunal's written invitation to testify as a witness at the Track II Hearing, in Spanish (Dr Zambrano does not know English):\n\n*\"Estimado Dr. Zambrano:*\n\n*Me pongo en contacto con Ud. en mi capacidad de Secretario del Tribunal en el caso CPA N\u00ba 2009-23: \"Chevron Corporation y Texaco Petroleum Company c.

We write to you as the Arbitration Tribunal appointed under the Treaty to decide the dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent. In this arbitration, the Claimants allege that the Respondent breached its obligations under international law by, inter alia, the actions and omissions of the Respondent's judicial branch during the Lago Agrio Litigation. The Respondent denies the Claimants' allegations and also objects to the jurisdictional basis for the Claimants' claims under the Treaty. There is to be an oral hearing in this arbitration to take place with the Claimants and the Respondent at the World Bank in Washington DC, USA from 21 April to 8 May 2015. The Arbitral Tribunal would wish to hear your factual testimony, it at all possible. For that purpose the Tribunal invites you as a witness to attend this hearing or, if that is not possible, to participate by video link. In the event of your accepting this invitation, the PCA will make further arrangements for your participation, including provision for your reasonable expenses. This invitation is made by the Arbitration Tribunal with the support of both the Claimants and the Respondent. We look forward to your early response, but no later than 7 April 2015. Yours etc.*\".\n\n4.23.\n\nAt the procedural meeting held with the Parties on 8 April 2015, the Tribunal reported that the above correspondence had been delivered to Dr Zambrano in Manta, Ecuador, as confirmed by the courier's receipt signed for Dr Zambrano on 7 April 2015.10 The Tribunal is satisfied that this correspondence reached Dr Zambrano personally; but there was again no response from him to the Tribunal.\n\nTranscript of the Procedural Meeting of 8 April 2015, p. 6; DHL Tracking Receipt for Waybill 4385719144.\n\n4.24.\n\nThe Tribunal regrets that Dr Zambrano did not testify before this Tribunal. The Tribunal recognises, however, that it was his right to choose not to do so. Further, on the materials available in this arbitration, the Tribunal accepts, as submitted by the Respondent, that his choice was not induced by the Respondent. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not think it appropriate to draw any adverse inference against the Respondent, as requested by the Claimants, for Dr Zambrano's absence as a witness in this arbitration.\n\n4.25.\n\nDr Zambrano did testify, on oath, in the RICO Litigation, before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan). His testimony, in the form of a statement, deposition and trial testimony, is available to this Tribunal as evidence by agreement of the Parties (as submitted by the Parties with their respective written pleadings).11 The Tribunal has made extensive use of it.\n\nSee the Tribunal's Procedural Order 45, para 5, and the Respondent's email message dated 31 August 2016 to the Tribunal.\n\n4.26.\n\n*(2) Mr Donziger:* Mr Steven Donziger is not an Ecuadorian lawyer or a citizen of Ecuador; nor is he to be regarded as an agent (or organ) of the Respondent for the purpose of attribution under international law. He is a citizen of the USA, resident in New York and a member of the New York Bar (currently suspended). For many years, since at least 1993, he acted as a representative of the Aguinda Plaintiffs first in the Aguinda Litigation in New York and, subsequently, of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation in Ecuador. He is Spanish-speaking.\n\n4.27.\n\nThe Tribunal would have wished to hear Mr Donziger testify personally in this arbitration *.* Mr Donziger was an important actor in the Lago Agrio Litigation leading up to the Lago Agrio Judgment and Clarification Order. However, it soon became apparent to the Tribunal that Mr Donziger would not be called as a witness by any Party to this arbitration. Nor was he. Moreover, as the principal defendant in the RICO Litigation brought by Chevron in New York, Mr Donziger clearly had other more pressing personal priorities than assisting this Tribunal as a witness. It was therefore pointless for the Tribunal itself to extend an invitation to him to testify at the Track II Hearing. Further, Mr Donziger was afforded a full opportunity to defend himself against Chevron's allegations of 'ghostwriting' and other improper conduct in the RICO Litigation.\n\n4.28.\n\nMr Donziger did testify at length, on oath, in the RICO Litigation in New York. His testimony, in the form of depositions and trial testimony, is available to this Tribunal with the Parties' agreement (also, as submitted by the Parties with their respective written pleadings).12 As with Dr Zambrano's testimony, the Tribunal has made extensive use of it.13\n\nAgain, see the Tribunal's Procedural Order 45, para 5, and the Respondent's email message dated 31 August 2016 to the Tribunal.\n\nThe Tribunal has not made use of the full materials in the RICO Litigation, said to be 3,750 exhibits totaling more than 82,800 pages, a 2,970 page transcript of the trial, 1,033 pages of written direct testimony and 7,340 pages of depositions. The Respondent recorded an objection to the Claimants' late submission of these full materials, which was accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n4.29.\n\nThe Tribunal has also made extensive use of Mr Donziger's personal notebook (or \"diary\"). This was originally a private document written by Mr Donziger for his own personal use only. It was disclosed by Mr Donziger to Chevron under court orders in the US Section 1782 and RICO Litigation brought by Chevron against Mr Donziger, along with his private email correspondence and computer hard drives. As a resident of New York, Mr Donziger was (and remains) subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the USA.\n\n4.30.\n\nThe Tribunal has made use of Mr Donziger's diary and emails with caution. What is written in a private diary and also in private emails to close colleagues cannot always be taken literally by third persons, long after the event. In the Tribunal's view, even the starkest statement has to be assessed in context and in the light of other circumstances prevailing at the time.\n\n4.31.\n\nThere is a further qualification. By October 2010, Mr Donziger's emails and computers in the USA had been seized by Chevron under orders from US Courts. Thereafter, if not months before, the form and content of communications between Mr Donziger in New York and his colleagues in Ecuador doubtless underwent a precautionary change.\n\n4.32.\n\nEven earlier, in his email to Mr Donziger of 30 March 2010, Mr Prieto (one of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in Ecuador) had already expressed grave concerns about 'going to jail' because of email disclosures to Chevron likely to be ordered by the US Courts in the US Section 1782 Litigation (see the chronology below). Even before any court orders for such disclosure, certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives had resorted to using code-words in their email messages to each other (see also the chronology below). It follows that the content of certain emails from at least October 2010 onwards is likely to have been tailored by certain of these representatives, if email was used by them for certain purposes at all.\n\n4.33.\n\nAs regards both Mr Donziger and other representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the Tribunal has made extensive use of the offcuts from the documentary film \"Crude\". These offcuts were never intended to be made public. As described further below, these offcuts (totalling about 600 hours of video film) were disclosed to Chevron under court orders in the US Section 1782 Litigation brought by Chevron against the film's director, Mr Joseph Berlinger.14\n\nC-649, C-359.\n\n4.34.\n\n*(3) The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Representatives* : The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and legal advisers, at different times, included Mr Norman Alberto Wray (a senior Ecuadorian lawyer and former judge of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court), Mr Crist\u00f3bal Bonifaz (of Amherst, MA, USA), Mr Pablo Fajardo Mendoza (from 2005), Mr Juan Pablo S\u00e1enz, Mr Julio Prieto M\u00e9ndez, Mr Alejandro Ponce Villacis, Mr Lu\u00eds Yanza (a director of the \"Frente de Defensa La Amazonia\" or \"Frente\" and, in English, the \"Amazon Defence Front\" or \"ADF\"), Mr Icoca Manuel Tegautal, Mr Joseph Kohn (of Kohn, Swift & Graf, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Patton Boggs (a law firm in Washington DC, USA from about August 2010) and, as already indicated, Mr Donziger. The funding for such legal representation came principally from Mr Kohn (until 2010), Mr Russell DeLeon,15 Patton Boggs and (from 2010) Burford Capital, in return for success fees calculated on recoveries from Chevron upon the eventual enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Other non-party funders appear to have become involved in the Lago Agrio Judgment's enforcement proceedings outside Ecuador.\n\nMr Deleon also partly financed the making of the documentary film \"Crude\" directed by Mr Joseph Berlinger.\n\n4.35.\n\nAs regards the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in Ecuador, especially Mr Fajardo, Mr S\u00e1enz, Mr Prieto and Mr Yanza,16 there is little evidence in this arbitration of what they said and did other than what is recorded in the \"Crude\" off-cuts and their written communications to and from Mr Donziger, as disclosed to Chevron in the US 1782 and RICO Litigation. Details of several significant events and relevant materials within Ecuador are therefore missing from the evidence adduced by the Parties in this arbitration. None of these individuals gave evidence in the RICO Litigation; they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the USA; and it was not in the power of this Tribunal or the Parties to compel their attendance as witnesses in these arbitration proceedings. Amongst this group, the leading figure in the Lago Agrio Litigation was Mr Fajardo, an Ecuadorian lawyer of conspicuous ability and industry who worked closely with Mr Donziger.\n\nThese and other individuals are described in the Selected Dramatis Personae above at page xiii.\n\n4.36.\n\n*(4) Dr Guerra:* Dr Alberto Guerra Bastidas testified under oath at the Track II Hearing, called by the Claimants, cross-examined by the Respondent and questioned by the Tribunal.17 The Respondent strongly impugned his credibility as a witness. Dr Guerra also testified under oath in the RICO Litigation and at the RICO trial in New York, where he was deposed and also cross-examined.18 Dr Guerra's testimony in the form of his several written witness statements, depositions and oral testimony was adduced by the Claimants in this arbitration.\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,593-758; D4,852-900. Dr Guerra was also deposed by the Respondent in this arbitration on 5 November 2013, R-907. He testified at the RICO trial on 23-25 October 2013 (C-1978).\n\nDr Guerra's written testimony before the Track II Hearing comprises his declaration of 17 November 2012, C-1616a; his first supplemental declaration of 13 January 2013, C-1648; his second supplemental declaration of 11 April 2013, R-1331 & C-1828; his witness statement of 9 October 2013, C-2358 & C-2386; and his RICO deposition of 2 May 2013, R-906 and C-1888.\n\n4.37.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, particular caution is required in assessing Dr Guerra's testimony. In the past, Dr Guerra has conducted himself with less than probity. For the present, whilst the Claimants have taken steps to protect the integrity of his testimony (in this and other related legal proceedings), there exists still a risk that Dr Guerra could colour his testimony to favour the Claimants as his benefactors during his exile from Ecuador.\n\n4.38.\n\nYet, whatever happened in the past and however great that incentive might be, having seen and heard him in person subject to vigorous cross-examination by the Respondent, the Tribunal considers that Dr Guerra was a witness of truth in his testimony at the Track II Hearing. The Tribunal has therefore relied upon his testimony where it can be corroborated by other evidence, at least in part. The Tribunal also notes that, in one material respect regarding the conduct of Respondent's executive branch towards the Lago Agrio Litigation, Dr Guerra gave evidence at the Track II Hearing that unequivocally supported the Respondent's case (to which the Tribunal returns below).\n\n***C: Ecuador's Oriente and its Inhabitants***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n4.39.\n\nThe Oriente area of Ecuador is situated in the eastern part of the country, within the Amazon basin, bordering on Columbia (to the north) and Peru (to the south). In describing the Oriente and its inhabitants, the Tribunal can do no better than to cite the work of Professor Kimerling and her colleagues in *Amazon Crude*, written more than 25 years ago (with footnotes here omitted):19\n\n*\"The tropical forests of the Oriente are among the most biologically diverse natural ecosystems on earth - a treasure trove of rare and unique species and a potential source of medicines, fruits, nuts, and other forest foods and products. Ecuador's ancient rain forests lie at the headwaters of the Amazon River system and help control flooding and erosion, even in the river's lower reaches. The Oriente's forests also help regulate the region's rainfall and climate. The forest is a storehouse of carbon. When it is burned or cleared, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, heightening the potential for global warming. The rain forests of the Oriente are also home to the region's indigenous peoples who depend on the forest for their livelihoods. Without the forest, Amazonian peoples would be threatened with cultural and, in some cases, physical extinction \u2026\".*\n\n*\"Ecuador's Oriente has a rich heritage of indigenous cultures and is home to eight groups of indigenous people. Estimates of the Oriente's indigenous population range from 90,000 to 250,000 \u2013 25 to 50 percent [of] the region's total population. Two groups, the Quichua and the Shuar, together account for the great majority of indigenous people in the Oriente. The balance of the population is found among the Achuar, Cofan, Huaorani, Shiwiar, Secoya, and Siona. The Huaorani number roughly 1,580 individuals, the Shiwiar some 600, and together the Secoya and Siona number about 350. The Cofan population, once 15,000, is now approximately 300 [citation omitted].\"*\n\n*\"Indigenous peoples have lived in Amazonia for thousands of years in harmony with their rain forest environment. Since the Spanish arrived in Ecuador nearly 500 years ago, the Oriente has been a magnet for fortune-seekers and missionaries. Spanish adventurers first entered upper Amazonia in what is now Ecuador, and the first mission bases were established there in the sixteenth century. It was not until the rubber extraction boom began in the late 1800s, however, that dreams of easy wealth first came true in Amazonia. A handful of 'rubber barons' became rich, but at great expense to the people. Their atrocities throughout Amazonia are well-documented. Thousands of indigenous people in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia were killed [citation omitted]. The boom ended in the early 1900s, when rubber seeds were smuggled out of Brazil and successfully cultivated on plantations in Malaysia.\"*\n\nR-473, pp. 33-34.\n\n4.40.\n\nThis case concerns only a part of Ecuador's Oriente, a former concession area in the north-east close to the Colombian border, near the town of Lago Agrio in the Province of Sucumb\u00edos (see the map in Annex 6 to this Part IV below).\n\n***D: Ecuador's Government and Judiciary***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n4.41.\n\n*(1) The Ecuadorian Government:* From 1964 onwards, Ecuador had a succession of governments of different political and economic persuasions. In February 1964, when the 1964 Concession Agreement was executed, Ecuador was governed by a military junta. It was succeeded by another military junta. In 1969, President Jos\u00e9 Ibarra became the President of Ecuador. In 1972, a military junta took power in Ecuador under General Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez Lara. During this r\u00e9gime, the 1973 Concession Agreement was executed.\n\n4.42.\n\nIn 1979, President Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera took office as the President of Ecuador, succeeded (on President Rold\u00f3s' death) by President Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea in 1981. In 1984, President Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero Rivadeneira took office as President of Ecuador, followed in 1988 by President Rodrigo Borja Cevallo and in 1992 by President Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n. During this r\u00e9gime, the Aguinda Litigation was commenced in New York in 1993; and the 1995 Settlement Agreement was executed, as also the 1995 Remedial Action Plan.\n\n4.43.\n\nIn 1996, President Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram took office as President of Ecuador, later (in February 1997) removed from office by the Congress and succeeded by an interim presidency, that included President Fabian Alarc\u00f3n. In 1998, President Jamil Mahuad took office as the President of Ecuador, later forced into exile by a military coup in January 2000. During these r\u00e9gimes, the 1998 Final Release was executed.\n\n4.44.\n\nIn 2002, President Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez took office as the President of Ecuador, but was later removed from office by the Congress in 2005 and succeeded by an interim presidency under President Alfredo Palacio. During the early part of this r\u00e9gime, the Lago Agrio Litigation was commenced in Ecuador in 2003.\n\n4.45.\n\nIn January 2007, President Rafael Correa took office as the President of Ecuador, being re-elected in 2009 and 2013. During this r\u00e9gime, the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court and the Cassation Court issued their respective judgments in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. President Correa had left office (in 2017) at the time of the Constitutional Court's Judgment (2018).\n\n4.46.\n\nUntil recently, at least, Ecuador was a country marked by political, economic and institutional instability that began long before President Correa's election in 2007.\n\n4.47.\n\nThe Claimants' case, as regards the Respondent's executive branch, is directed principally at President Correa and his political administration during the period from 2007 onwards, during the pendency of the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.48.\n\n*(2) The Ecuadorian Judiciary* : The relevant court in the Oriente, the Sucumb\u00edos Provincial Court of Justice of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio (the \"Lago Agrio Court\"), operated on a meagre budget under a swift succession of presiding judges responsible for the Lago Agrio Litigation. It was not designed for and had never previously experienced any case of the size, duration, complexity and controversy comparable to the Lago Agrio Litigation. At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent's Counsel stated that the Lago Agrio Litigation grew to become 2,000 times the size of the typical Ecuadorian lawsuit.20\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,327.\n\n4.49.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Litigation was heard by the Lago Agrio Court before a succession of Lago Agrio Judges between May 2003 and March 2011, a period of almost eight years; namely: (i) Judge Guerra (13 May 2003 \u2013 3 February 2004), (ii) Judge Novillo (4 February 2004 \u2013 1 February 2006), (iii) Judge Y\u00e1nez (2 February 2006 \u2013 2 October 2007), (iv) Judge Novillo, again (3 October 2007 \u2013 24 August 2008), (v) Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez (25 August 2008 \u2013 20 October 2009), (vi) Judge Zambrano (21 October 2009 \u2013 11 March 2010), (vii) Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (12 March 2010 \u2013 10 October 2010) and lastly (viii), Judge Zambrano, again (11 October 2010 \u2013 29 February 2011). It was Judge Zambrano who issued the Lago Agrio Judgment and its Clarifying Order on 14 February 2011 and 4 March 2011 respectively.\n\n4.50.\n\nJudges N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez were recused as judges in the Lago Agrio Litigation, respectively in August 2009 and October 2010. Unconnected with the Lago Agrio Litigation, Judge Guerra was dismissed from the Ecuadorian judiciary in May 2008. In 2012, also unconnected with the Lago Agrio Litigation, one year after the Lago Agrio Judgment, Judge Zambrano was also dismissed from the Ecuadorian judiciary.\n\n4.51.\n\nThe Claimants' case, as regards the Ecuadorian judiciary, is directed principally at Judge Zambrano during the two periods when he presided over the Lago Agrio Litigation, from (i) October 2009 to March 2010 and (ii) October 2010 to March 2011.\n\n4.52.\n\nIt is necessary to note that the Lago Agrio Court operated on limited resources. From his time as a judge of the Lago Agrio Court, Dr Guerra gave, as an example, the fact that even court seals had to be procured by the judge or clerk using their own money.21 The Tribunal also notes that Judge Zambrano had personally to arrange for a temporary student secretary, ostensibly at his own immediate expense, whilst presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation. He had no law clerk or legal assistant.\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,645.\n\n4.53.\n\nMore generally, the Tribunal also refers to part of the statement made by the Respondent's Attorney-General at the Jurisdictional Hearing, as recorded in its Third Interim Award. There, the Attorney-General stated (as translated into English):22\n\n*\"\u2026 As a first point, I would like to talk about the present justice system in Ecuador. In the year 2008, the latest Constitutional Assembly in Ecuador as an expression of sovereign expression of the Ecuadorian nation approved the new Constitution that rules our country at the moment \u2026*\n\n*In terms of the justice administration, the new Constitution consolidated previous efforts of the judicial reform of Nineties. Although still we are not in the position that we would like to be, we are achieving important progress in this ambit. First of all, we have to concentrate the existence of Courts and other Tribunals to marginal places allowing better access to justice. [Secondly,] There is an improvement in justice efficiency in relation to the number of cases that are resolved. Thirdly, we have achieved greater transparency and publicity in terms of the activities of the judiciary; and, fourthly, we have developed norms that rules behaviour of judges and lawyers.*\n\n*In this way, in our system of justice is an improvement. There is advancement. We continuously improve trying to achieve high standards, standards of efficiency for the benefit of the Ecuadorian society.*\n\n*\u2026 I accepted my designation, and I have done my job as Procurador of the State of the Republic of Ecuador convinced and respectful of the autonomy of the functions of the State because I am convinced of the independency of the justice system of my country and the process of change. But by the same token I am very conscious of the difficult problems affecting our systems still. We still have delays in processes in front of our courts. We have complaints against dishonest Courts, and we have problems of salaries for judges and magistrates and lawyers. But I am conscious of our problems.*\n\n*\u2026 We know our deficiencies, but we are working to correct them.\"*\n\nThird Interim Award, pp. 73ff.\n\n4.54.\n\nThere was another factor especially relevant to Judge Zambrano: Judge Zambrano was not experienced in handling and deciding civil cases, let alone large and complex cases.\n\n***E: The 1964 and 1973 Concessions***\n--------------------------------------\n\n4.55.\n\nOn 21 February 1964, the Respondent granted oil exploration and production rights in Ecuador's Oriente region to TexPet (a subsidiary of Texaco) and the Ecuadorian Gulf Oil Company (a subsidiary of Gulf) under a written concession made with these companies' local subsidiaries operating as a Consortium (\"the 1964 Concession Agreement).23 TexPet was the \"Operator\" for the Consortium under the Texaco-Gulf Joint Operating Agreement of 1 January 1965.24\n\nC-6.\n\nC-409.\n\n4.56.\n\nIn 1967, the Consortium discovered significant deposits of crude oil in the Oriente and drilled its first wells. By 1969, the Consortium had found considerable reserves of crude oil.\n\n4.57.\n\nBy 1972, the Consortium had developed nine oil fields and constructed an oil pipeline over the Andes to the Pacific coast (the \"SOTE\" pipeline).\n\n4.58.\n\nOn 6 August 1973, the Respondent, TexPet and Gulf entered into a further concession agreement with a term expiring on 6 June 1992 (\"the 1973 Concession Agreement\").25 It was also agreed (inter alia) to grant an option to acquire an interest in the Consortium to the Ecuadorian State Oil Corporation, CEPE (abbreviated from Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana, later succeeded by PetroEcuador).26\n\nC-7.\n\nC-7, Articles 4, 28 & 29.\n\n4.59.\n\nThe 1973 Concession Agreement imposed environmental and related obligations on the Contractors (TexPet and Gulf) and the Operator (TexPet). Pursuant to Section 46.1 (Preservation of Natural Resources), the Contractors \"shall adopt all convenient measures for the preservation of the flora, fauna and other natural resources, and they all [shall] also refrain from polluting water courses, the atmosphere and the soil, under supervision of the relevant Government agencies.\" Section 51.1 provided: \"Upon termination of this contract as a result of the expiration of its term \u2026, the contractors shall deliver to CEPE, for no consideration and in good production conditions, all the commercially exploitable hydrocarbon reserves, any wells in activity at that moment, \u2026 and any other real and personal property that [they] acquired in connection with this contract, provided that all such property shall be in good condition.\" Section 40.1 provided: \"The contractors shall use modern and efficient machinery, and they shall use the most adequate technology and methods in their activities so as to obtain the highest productivity in the exploitation of deposits, observing at all times the reserve preservation policy laid out by the Government\u2026\"\n\n4.60.\n\nIn 1974, CEPE (PetroEcuador) exercised its option under the 1973 Concession Agreement, thereby acquiring a 25% stake in the Consortium.27 TexPet and Gulf each retained a 37.5% interest in the Consortium.\n\nC-417.\n\n4.61.\n\nOn 21 December 1976: CEPE (PetroEcuador) acquired Gulf's remaining interest, thereby owning a 62.5% interest in the Consortium. (TexPet retained its 37.5% minority interest until the Consortium ended in 1992).28\n\nC-8.\n\n4.62.\n\nOn 30 June 1990 *,* TexPet ceased to act as the \"Operator\" under the 1973 Concession Agreement, after 25 years (1965 to 1990). From 1 July 1990 onwards, PetroEcuador (by its subsidiary, Petroamazonas) became the \"Operator\" under the 1973 Concession Agreement.29 TexPet, as an Operator, left the Oriente in 1990.\n\nC-418.\n\n4.63.\n\nOn 6 June 1992, the term of the 1973 Concession Agreement expired. TexPet, as a Contractor, left Ecuador. There was then no longer any presence by TexPet in the concession area or Ecuador in any capacity. Texaco (TexPet's parent company) was itself never active in the concession area. Nor was Chevron at any time, before or after 1992, engaged in activities in the concession area. (Chevron only became TexPet's ultimate parent some ten years later, after the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron in 2001).\n\n4.64.\n\nAs at 1992, the Consortium with, as Operator TexPet (from 1965 to 1990) and CEPE/PetroEcuador (from 1990 to 1992), had developed within the concession area 16 production fields, with 321 wells, 18 production stations, 6 base camps and hundreds of miles of associated pipelines, together with the SOTE pipeline over the Andes. The Consortium's activities had generated about US$ 23.3 billion in revenues, of which about US$ 22.67 billion (97.3%) was received by the Respondent in the form of income taxes, royalties, contribution for domestic consumption and gross profit on PetroEcuador's share in the Consortium.30 TexPet itself had received about US$ 480 million in revenues.31 The Consortium had helped to make Ecuador the second largest oil exporter in Latin America (after Venezuela), doubling Ecuador's per capita GDP, but making its national budget heavily dependent on oil revenues.\n\nKaczmarek ER1, Table 1 and para 84.\n\nKaczmarek ER1, para 84, Figure 5.\n\n4.65.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2008, after TexPet's departure from Ecuador, PetroEcuador's subsequent operations in the area of the former concession in the Oriente generated about 1.2 billion barrels of crude oil, representing a market value of about US$ 57 billion.32\n\nC-436, pp. 1 & 7.\n\n4.66.\n\nThe 1995 Settlement Agreement,33 the 1995 Remedial Action Plan34 and the 1998 Final Release35 addressed environmental issues arising from the 1964 and 1973 Concession Agreements. The Settlement Agreement was signed for TexPet by its Vice-President, Mr Ricardo Reis Veiga and by its legal representative, Dr Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Pallares. The 1995 Remedial Action Plan was signed for TexPet by Mr Veiga. The 1998 Final Release was signed for TexPet by Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez.\n\nC-23.\n\nR-610.\n\nC-53.\n\n4.67.\n\nTo perform the remediation work for environmental damage under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, TexPet selected Woodward-Clyde, a well-known engineering firm specialising in environmental remediation. Woodward-Clyde prepared the Remedial Action Plan in accordance with the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Plan identified the specific pits at each site that required remediation and the remedial action to be taken at each site. In September 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador, TexPet and Woodward-Clyde approved the Remedial Action Plan. Between October 1995 and September 1998, Woodward-Clyde conducted the remediation required by the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1995 Remedial Action Plan (at TexPet's expense).\n\n4.68.\n\nIn all, TexPet spent approximately US$ 40 million on environmental remediation and community development in Ecuador under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the Remedial Action Plan (together with the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases).\n\n4.69.\n\nOn 30 September 1998, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet signed the Final Release (the \"Acta Final\"), certifying that TexPet had performed all its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n4.70.\n\nIn its Third Interim Award, First Partial Award and Decision in this arbitration, the Tribunal has already considered at some length and made certain decisions upon the meaning and effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It is unnecessary to repeat those decisions here, which remain in effect (see Annex 1 to Part 1 for the Operative Parts of the Third Interim Award, First Partial Award and Decision).\n\n***F: Crude Oil Pollution in the Oriente***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n4.71.\n\nThere is today crude oil pollution in the former concession area of the Oriente, including pollution lying close to human habitation. The Tribunal has seen such pollution, albeit only briefly during its site-visit to four sites in the former concession area in June 2015.36 More significantly, the fact of such pollution has never been denied by the Claimants themselves. Rather, the technical and legal issues concern the nature, effect, timing and cause of such pollution, including the role played by PetroEcuador (both before and, particularly, after TexPet's departure from the concession area as Operator in 1990).\n\nThese sites were: (i) Shushufindi Field: SSF-34 Well Site; (ii) Aguarico Field: AG-06 Well Site; (iii) Shushufindi Field: SSF-55 Well Site; and (iv) Lago Agrio Field: LA-02 Well Site. The Parties' presentations at each site were recorded by verbatim transcript and film. (This film is kept by the PCA, by order of the Tribunal).\n\n4.72.\n\nThe origin of such crude oil pollution, apart from accidental leaks and spills, derives principally from a mixture of oil and \"produced water\" in pits, subject to run-off into adjoining land and water courses. It was described by the Respondent (with its expert Dr Garvey) as follows during the Tribunal's site-visit to the SSF-34 Well Site (The site was originally drilled in 1973 and \"shut in\", or abandoned, by TexPet in 1983; it then comprised a plugged well and three pits; and, where cleared of encroaching jungle, the land is currently used for subsistence farming, with chocolate cacao plants and natural papaya trees):37\n\n*\"When TexPet came and drilled oil, they set up their oil rig here where the hole in the ground is; and to get to the oil it's approximately 3,000 meters deep. So 9 to 10,000 feet is where the oil-producing layers are in this area. To drill down that far, there's a significant amount of rock and dirt that came out of the hole; and they had to have some place to put that. These are called cuttings pits or reserve pits. And this large pit over here to the side probably started off as a cuttings and reserve pit, so the debris would [be] placed immediately to the side of the well. When you're drilling a well, to get the debris to come out, you have to force drilling mud, which is a sort of a thick mud that, as you push it down, it pushes the rocks and the debris out; and to make drilling mud, you need a significant amount of water \u2026 After the well was drilled and they reached the oil layers, this pit and these reserve pits would often end up filled with oil \u2026\"*\n\n*\"\u2026 In order for us to find oil present to the surface, the reservoir that's supplying this oil has to be quite large because it has to have been insulated from weathering for 30 years. How was it insulated? \u2026 We have leaf litter falling on top of the pit. It prevents oxygen from penetrating into the underground; and, as a result, the oil here is effectively capped temporarily by this leaf litter and prevented from weathering. What does that mean? Well, it means that a small disturbance \u2026 that a farmer might make would very quickly release the oil back to the surface here. Additionally, a large change in the water table \u2026 could also push the oil upward above it. This may, in fact, be the reason we see oil at the surface here \u2026\".*\n\nSite-Visit Transcript S1.12ff; S1.25ff.\n\n4.73.\n\nThis general description does not include the range and complexity of the environmental issues raised by the Parties and their respective expert witnesses in regard to crude oil pollution in the former concession area, as also the legal issues arising from such pollution and the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n***G: The Lawsuits, Arbitrations, Prosecutions and Investigations***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.74.\n\nThe crude oil pollution in the concession area has given rise to extensive legal disputes over the last 25 years, producing multinational lawsuits and arbitrations on a scale unprecedented in the collective experience of this Tribunal. For ease of reference later, it is necessary to list these principal lawsuits and arbitrations at the outset. The Tribunal here also addresses the criminal prosecutions and investigations in Ecuador.\n\n4.75.\n\n*(1) The Aguinda Litigation (New York):* The Aguinda Complaint was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York on 3 November 1993. It pleaded a claim by the Aguinda Plaintiffs as a putative (uncertified) class action under the USA's Federal Rules of Procedure, by named individuals and \"on behalf of a class of all others similarly situated\" for personal injuries and property damage caused by the defendant's wrongdoing.38 The original defendant was Texaco.\n\nC-14, pp. 2-3.\n\n4.76.\n\nAs pleaded, the named individuals and unnamed class members estimated as numbering 30,000 were all resident in Ecuador from 1972 onwards within a geographical area defined by latitude and longitude, south of the Colombian border.39 This complaint asserted individual civil claims for personal injury and property damage, aggregated as members of the same putative class. The causes of action were pleaded in tort, including negligence, public nuisance, private nuisance, strict liability, trespass and civil conspiracy, with relief claimed as compensatory damages, punitive damages and equitable relief to remedy the alleged pollution and contamination \"of the plaintiffs' environment and the personal injuries and property damage caused thereby\" (page 4).\n\nC-14, pp. 17-19.\n\n4.77.\n\nAs decided by this Tribunal in its Decision on Track 1B,40 the Aguinda Complaint in New York was not a 'diffuse' claim. This much, at least, is common ground between the Parties.41 As the Claimants acknowledged at the April Hearing (on Track 1B): \"\u2026 both Parties agree that what was at issue in Aguinda were individual claims, aggregate[d] individual claims.\"42\n\nDecision on Track 1B, Paragraphs 147-149.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1.97.\n\nApril Hearing D2,372.\n\n4.78.\n\nAs recorded by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment of 5 August 1997, the Aguinda Plaintiffs' claims for equitable relief in the Complaint were later elaborated: \"Though the complaints make only a general demand for equitable relief, the plaintiffs clarified their demand somewhat during discovery. The relief they seek includes the following: undertaking or financing environmental cleanup, to include access to potable water and hunting and fishing grounds, renovating or closing the Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline, creation of an environmental monitoring fund, formulating standards to govern future Texaco oil development, creation of a medical monitoring fund, an injunction restraining Texaco from entering into activities that run that run a high risk of environmental or human injuries, and restitution.\"43\n\nC-291, p. 5.\n\n4.79.\n\nBy its judgment dated 12 November 1996, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Rakoff) dismissed the Aguinda Complaint.44 Apart from applying the doctrine of forum non conveniens (in favour of the Ecuadorian Courts), the judgment referred to the Aguinda Plaintiffs' failure to join, as indispensable parties, PetroEcuador and Ecuador:\n\n*\"\u2026 this Court further concludes that there is another independently- sufficient reason why this action must be dismissed: plaintiffs' failure to join indispensable parties, namely, Petroecuador and the Republic of Ecuador. The extensive equitable relief sought by the plaintiffs-ranging from total environmental 'cleanup' of the affected lands in Ecuador to a major alteration of the consortium's TransEcuador pipeline [i.e. the \"SOTE\" pipeline] to the direct monitoring of the affected lands for years to come cannot possibly be undertaken in the absence of Petroecuador, which has owned 100% of the consortium since 1992 and 100% of the pipeline since 1986, or the Republic of Ecuador, which has helped supervise the consortium's activities from the outset and which owns much, if not all, of the affected lands. Petroecuador and the Republic of Ecuador thus are necessary 'persons to be joined if feasible' under either and both prongs of Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)*\n\nC-477.\n\n4.80.\n\nBy its judgment of 12 August 1997, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Rakoff) denied Ecuador's request to join the Aguinda Complaint as an intervener.45\n\nSee C-291, p. 12.\n\n4.81.\n\nThe Aguinda Plaintiffs (and Ecuador) appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. By its judgment of 5 October 1998, the Second Circuit vacated Judge Rakoff's orders and remitted the case to him at the US District Court for reconsideration.46 It held (inter alia) that dismissal on the ground of forum non conveniens was erroneous in the absence of a condition requiring Texaco to submit to jurisdiction in Ecuador.\n\nSee C-291, p. 1.\n\n4.82.\n\nBy its judgment dated 30 May 2001, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Rakoff) dismissed the Aguinda Complaint for a second time.47 The Court ordered an unconditional stay on the ground of forum non conveniens because the case had \"everything to do with Ecuador and nothing to do with the United States [of America]\". As there also recorded: \"Following remand [by the Second Circuit to Judge Rakoff], Texaco provided the missing commitment to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Ecuador\" (page 4 of the judgment).\n\nC-10.\n\n4.83.\n\nThis undertaking in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction took the form of a Notice of Agreements made by Texaco on 11 January 1999.48 It provides (in material part) as follows:\n\n*\"Section A - Actions to Which Agreements Apply: Texaco Inc.'s agreements herein apply only to a lawsuit that meets all the following conditions:*\n\n*1. The lawsuit must be brought by a named plaintiff in Aguinda. et al. v, Texaco Inc., Case No. 93 Civ. 7527 (JSR) (hereafter \"Aguinda\").*\n\n*2. The lawsuit must have been filed in an appropriate court of competent civil jurisdiction in Ecuador;*\n\n*3. The lawsuit must arise out of the same events and occurrences alleged in the Aguinda Complaint filed in this Court on November 3, 1993.*\n\n*4. To insure prompt notice, a copy of each Complaint intended to be filed by Aguinda plaintiffs (or any of them) in Ecuador must have been delivered to Texaco Inc.'s designated representative in Ecuador identified in Section B(1) below not later than the actual date on which it is filed.*\n\n*Section B - Agreements: With respect to any lawsuit that meets the conditions set forth above (a \"Foreign Lawsuit\"), Texaco Inc. hereby makes the following agreements:*\n\n*1. Texaco Inc. will accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit in accordance with the applicable law of Ecuador. Texaco Inc.'s designated representative in Ecuador authorized to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit shall be: [Name and address of Texaco's representative in Quito Ecuador here omitted]. The authority of [Texaco's representative] to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit will become effective upon final dismissal of this action and judgment by this Court. (The judgment shall become \"final\" upon the exhaustion of all available appeals or, if no appeal is filed, the time for filing appeals has expired.)*\n\n*2. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive and/or not assert an objection based on lack of in personam jurisdiction to the civil jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in Ecuador.*\n\n*3. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive any statute of limitations-based defense that matured during the period of time between: (a) the filing date of the Aguinda Complaint in this Court (i.e. November 3, 1993), and (b) the 60th day after the dismissal of this action and judgment becomes final, as defined in Section B(1) above. Texaco Inc., however, is not waiving any statute of limitations-based rights or defenses with respect to the passage of time prior to November 3, 1993, and Texaco Inc. expressly reserves its right to contend in a Foreign Lawsuit that plaintiffs' claims were barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable statute of limitations as of November 3, 1993 when they filed their Complaint in this Court.*\n\n*4. Texaco Inc. agrees that discovery conducted to date during the pendency of Aguinda in this Court may be used by any party in a Foreign Lawsuit, including Texaco Inc., to the same extent as if that discovery had been conducted in proceedings there, subject to all parties' rights to challenge the admissibility and relevance of such discovery under the applicable rules of evidence.*\n\n*5. Texaco Inc. agrees to satisfy a final judgment (i.e. a judgment with respect to which all appeals have been exhausted), if any, entered against it in a Foreign Lawsuit in favor of a named plaintiff in Aguinda, subject to Texaco Inc.'s reservation of its right to contest any such judgment under New York's Recognition of Foreign Country Money Judgments Act, 7B N.Y. Civ. Prac. L&R \u00a7 5301-09 (McKinney 1978).\"*\n\n(This undertaking, as varied, came into effect with the eventual stay of the Aguinda Litigation on 16 August 2002, i.e. after Texaco's \"merger\" with Chevron in 2001).\n\nR-3 (as more fully described in this Tribunal's Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para 3.32).\n\n4.84.\n\nIn 2001, the Aguinda Plaintiffs appealed from Judge Rakoff's dismissal to the US Court of Appeals for Second Circuit. By its judgment dated 16 August 2002, the Second Circuit affirmed, as modified, Judge Rakoff's Order.49\n\nC-65.\n\n4.85.\n\nThe Second Circuit recorded (page 4): \"Texaco consented to personal jurisdiction in Ecuador as to the Aguinda plaintiffs \u2026 in \u2026 Ecuador \u2026. Texaco stipulated it would waive its statute of limitations defenses that matured during the period of time between the filing of the complaint and the 60th day after the dismissal of the action by the district court. It preserved such defenses, however, with respect to the passage of time prior to the initial filing of the complaints. It also offered to stipulate that plaintiffs could utilize the discovery obtained thus far in resumed proceedings in Ecuador or Peru. Texaco then renewed its motion to dismiss by reason of forum non conveniens.\" The Second Circuit decided (page 8): \"The district court's judgment dismissing for forum non conveniens is affirmed, subject to the modification that the judgment be conditioned on Texaco's agreement to waive defenses based on statutes of limitation for limitation periods expiring between the institution of these actions [i.e. 3 November 1993] and a date one year subsequent to the final judgment of dismissal. \" The Tribunal understands that Texaco agreed to vary its condition regarding limitation, as directed by the Second Circuit.\n\n4.86.\n\nMuch later, in 2011, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided in the New York Stay Legal Proceedings (described below) that Texaco's undertaking (of 1999, as varied) bound Chevron, albeit a distinct and separate legal person under the laws of the USA. The Second Circuit held :50\n\n*\"Chevron Corporation claims, without citation to relevant case law, that it is not bound by the promises made by its predecessors in interest Texaco and ChevronTexaco, Inc. However, in seeking affirmation of the district court's forum non conveniens dismissal, lawyers from Chevron-Texaco appeared in this Court and reaffirmed the concessions that Texaco had made in order to secure dismissal of Plaintiffs' complaint. In so doing, Chevron-Texaco bound itself to those concessions. In 2005, Chevron-Texaco dropped the name \"Texaco\" and reverted to its original name, Chevron Corporation. There is no indication in the record before us that shortening its name had any effect on Chevron-Texaco's legal obligations. Chevron Corporation therefore remains accountable for the promises upon which we and the district court relied in dismissing [the Aguinda] Plaintiffs' action.\"51*\n\nCLA-435; R-247.\n\nCLA-435; R-24, fn 3.\n\n4.87.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the continuing controversy as to whether or not Texaco's 1999 undertaking (as varied) binds Chevron, as distinct from Texaco. Although other legal materials suggest otherwise, this decision of the Second Circuit ostensibly binds both Chevron and the Respondent as a matter of issue (or collateral) estoppel and judicial estoppel under the laws of the USA. (For reasons explained in Part VIII below, the Tribunal does not think it necessary or appropriate to decide this controversy, one way or the other, in this Award).\n\n4.88.\n\nDuring the Aguinda Litigation, in support of its case on forum non conveniens, Texaco generally lauded the Ecuadorian judicial system as the forum for its disputes with the Aguinda Plaintiffs. In the words of one of Texaco's expert witnesses testifying in 2000: \"Despite isolated problems that may have occurred in individual criminal proceedings, Ecuador's judicial system is neither corrupt nor unfair. Such isolated problems are not characteristic of Ecuador's judicial system, as a whole\".52\n\nC-2541; R-1222A, Section II.E, fn 6.\n\n4.89.\n\n*(2) The Lago Agrio Litigation (Ecuador):* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Complaint against Chevron as the sole named defendant is, in its original Spanish version, a document of 17 pages.53 It was filed with the Lago Agrio Court on 7 May 2003. By this time, the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron had taken place (in 2001).\n\nC-71.\n\n4.90.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Complaint begins with the list of the 48 individual plaintiffs, all being (as translated into English) \"domiciled in the Secoya Community of San Pablo de Aguarico, Canton of Shushufundi, Province of Sucumb\u00edos\" and \"Ecuadorian nationals engaged in farming activities.\" These plaintiffs are described as having been the same Aguinda Plaintiffs in the stayed Aguinda Litigation New York, having there sought \"enforcement of their own rights as well as those of other people in the same class, as the term is used in [New York's] procedural rules to designate the people who might find themselves in an identical legal situation with regard to the specifics of the lawsuit [i.e. the Aguinda Litigation]\" (Paragraph 8).\n\n4.91.\n\nPart I of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the alleged \"background\" to the case, including the 1998 Final Release (forming part of the 1995 Settlement) and the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron. Part II pleads the alleged \"contaminating methods employed by Texaco\". Part III pleads the alleged consequential \"damage and the affected population\". Its Paragraph III.2 pleads, as a matter of causation, the alleged consequences to the health and life expectancy of the population, including but not expressly so, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Part IV pleads \"Texaco Inc.'s liability\". In the latter's Paragraph IV.9, Texaco's liability and remedial obligation were allegedly \"passed on to\" Chevron by virtue of the \"merger\" between the two corporations\" described in Paragraph I.12. Thus far, apart from the allegations directed expressly against Chevron, there is a broad similarity between the complaint in the Aguinda Litigation and the complaint in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.92.\n\nPart V of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the \"legal basis\" for the claim under the laws of Ecuador. It invokes Articles 2241 and 2256 of the Civil Code (Paragraph V.1); Articles 23.6 and 86 of the Constitution (Paragraph V.3(a)); Article 2260 of the Civil Code, later re-numbered as Article 2236 (Paragraph V.1(b)); and Articles 41 and 43 of the 1999 Environmental Management Act, the \"EMA\" (Paragraph V.3(c)).54 These EMA provisions are alleged to establish \"a public action\" (\"acci\u00f3n p\u00fablica\") based on the breach of environmental laws\" and \"the right of legal entities, individuals or human groups bound by a common interest and directly affected by a harmful action or omission, to bring an action for damages based on the harm to their health and environment, including the biodiversity along with its constituting elements.\"55\n\nThese texts are set out above, in both the original Spanish and English translation: see Part I, Annex 5.\n\nIn the original Spanish: \"[la Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental] *reconoce a las personas naturales o jur\u00eddicas y a los grupos humanos vinculados por un inter\u00e9s com\u00fan y afectados directamente por la acci\u00f3n u omisi\u00f3n da\u00f1osa, el derecho a interponer acciones por da\u00f1os y perjuicios y por el deterioro causado a la salud o al medio ambiente, incluyendo la biodiversidad con sus elementos constitutivos*\".\n\n4.93.\n\nPart VI of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the \"prayer for relief\". Such relief is claimed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs \"in our capacity as members of the affected communities and in safeguard of their recognized collective rights\".56 The relief claims specific remedial and ancillary works, with the necessary funds to be paid by Texaco to the Amazon Defense Front (the \"ADF\"), together with 10% of such value payable (with litigation costs) to the ADF \"by express request of the plaintiffs\". It does not expressly claim compensation for personal harm particular to the individual Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, or any of them. Part VI addresses \"jurisdiction, amount of claim and procedure\", invoking (inter alia) Articles 42(2) and 43 of the EMA. Part VIII addresses \"notices\".\n\nIn the original Spanish, \"*como miembros de las comunidades afectadas y en guardia de los derechos reconocidos colectivamente a \u00e9stas \u2026*\".\n\n4.94.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Court issued its Judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation on 14 February 2011 (with its Clarification Order of 4 March 2011), adverse to Chevron. Chevron initiated three successive appeals against the Lago Agrio Judgment, resulting in the Judgments of the Appellate Court (2012), the Cassation Court (2013) and the Constitutional Court (2018).\n\n4.95.\n\n*(3) The \"Commercial Cases\" Arbitration (The Hague)* This arbitration, known as the \"Commercial Cases Arbitration\", was brought under Article VI of the Treaty, applying the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, the Netherlands (PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277), by Chevron and TexPet as the claimants, against Ecuador, as the respondent. This UNCITRAL arbitration was commenced on 21 December 2006.\n\n4.96.\n\nThe Commercial Cases tribunal made an interim award on jurisdiction of 1 December 2008, a partial award on the merits of 30 March 201057 and a final award of 31 August 2011.58 The tribunal rejected the respondent's jurisdictional objections; the tribunal found a breach by the respondent of its obligation under Article II(7) of the Treaty (\"effective means\"),59 through the undue delay of the Ecuadorian courts in deciding TexPet's seven cases asserting contractual claims for payment under the two Concession Agreements of 1964 and 1973; and the tribunal held the respondent liable for damages in the principal amount of US$ 77.74 million, together with pre-award and post-award compound interest.\n\nCLA-47.\n\nRLA-351.\n\nArticle II(7) of the USA-Ecuador BIT provides: \"*Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investments, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.\"* (In the Spanish version, it reads \"*Cada parte establecer\u00e1 medios eficaces para hacer valer las reclamaciones y respetar los derechos relativos a las inversiones, los acuerdos de inversi\u00f3n y las autorizaciones de inversi\u00f3n*.\").\n\n4.97.\n\nUnder challenge by the respondent, the awards in the Commercial Cases were upheld by the Dutch courts: namely, the Hague District Court (2012), the Hague Court of Appeal (June 2013) and the Hoge Raad (26 September 2014).60 In the USA, the US District Court for the District of Columbia recognised and enforced the final award under the 1958 New York Convention in 2013.61 The US Court of Appeals for the District Court of Columbia Circuit dismissed the respondent's appeal on 4 August 2015.62\n\nC-1930, C-1931; see the Claimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 26 September 2014.\n\nC-1927, C-1932.\n\nC-2523.\n\n4.98.\n\nTo the Tribunal's understanding, on 22 July 2016, Ecuador (as the respondent) paid to Chevron and TexPet the sums due under the awards made in the Commercial Cases Arbitration.63\n\nSee the Claimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 19 March 2018, p. 7.\n\n4.99.\n\nApart from the Commercial Cases tribunal's interpretation of Article II(7) of the Treaty (to which the Tribunal returns in Part VII below), this Tribunal does not consider that the Commercial Cases Arbitration provides any specific guidance to the relevant issues in this arbitration.\n\n4.100.\n\nAs to Article II(7), the Tribunal notes that the Commercial Cases tribunal decided in its Partial Award that Ecuador's obligation as to \"effective means\" constitutes a lex specialis and not a restatement of customary international law on denial of justice, that the failure of domestic courts to enforce rights effectively would constitute a violation of Article II(7); and that the host State's treaty obligation was a positive obligation to provide \"effective means\", as opposed to a mere negative obligation not to interfere in the functioning of those means.64 It also notes the Commercial Cases tribunal's reference to the \"measure of deference\" to be afforded to a domestic judicial system and that the tribunal was \"not empowered [by Article II(7) of the Treaty] to act as a court of appeal reviewing every individual alleged failure of the local judicial system de novo.\"65 (The Tribunal returns to these matters also, in Part VII, below).\n\nSee CLA-47, paras 241, 243, 244, 248.\n\nCLA-47, para 246.\n\n4.101.\n\n*(4) The Ecuador-USA Treaty Arbitration (PCA):* This was an inter-state arbitration brought on 28 June 2011 by Ecuador (as the claimant) against the USA (as respondent) under Article VII of the Treaty providing for State-State arbitration,66 resulting in an award dated 29 September 2012 dismissing Ecuador's claim for want of jurisdiction.67 That claim concerned (inter alia) the interpretation of \"effective means\" in Article II(7) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty (i.e. the same Treaty in this case), as decided in the partial award issued in the Commercial Cases Arbitration.\n\nArticle VII(1) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty provided (inter alia): \"*Any dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty which is not resolved through consultations or other diplomatic channels, shall be submitted upon the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal for binding decision in accordance with the applicable rules of international law \u2026*\"\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v. United States of America*, PCA Case No. 2012-05, Award, 29 September 2012.\n\n4.102.\n\n*(5) The AAA Arbitration (New York*): This arbitration was commenced in June 2004 before the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\") in New York under an arbitration agreement allegedly contained in the 1965 Joint Operating Agreement (the \"1965 JOA\") and a draft JOA of 1974 under the 1964 and 1973 Concession Agreements (i.e. it was not brought under the Treaty).\n\n4.103.\n\nThe claimants were Chevron and TexPet, asserting a contractual indemnity for environmental damage from the respondents, Ecuador and PetroEcuador. The respondents applied in New York to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York for a stay of the AAA Arbitration. By orders of the US District Court (Judge Sand), the AAA Arbitration was partially stayed in June 2007,68 affirmed on appeal by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 7 October 2008.69 The US Supreme Court denied Chevron's petition for a writ of certiorari in June 2009.70\n\nR-73.\n\nR-74.\n\nR-75.\n\n4.104.\n\n(6) *The New York Stay Legal Proceedings (New York):* On 14 January 2010, the Respondent and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs applied to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to stay this arbitration between the Claimants and the Respondent under the Treaty. Their application was rejected by the District Court (Judge Sand) on 16 March 2010.71 On appeal, the District Court's judgment was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 17 March 2011.72\n\nCLA-168.\n\nR-247; CLA-435.\n\n4.105.\n\nIn its judgment, the Second Circuit recognised the autonomous nature, or 'separability', of the Treaty from the arbitration agreement between the Claimants and the Respondent derived from the Treaty:\n\n*\"At the outset, we note that Chevron is not a party to the BIT. Unlike the more typical scenario where the agreement to arbitrate is contained in an agreement between the parties to the arbitration, here the BIT merely creates a framework through which foreign investors, such as Chevron, can initiate arbitration against parties to the Treaty. In the end, however, this proves to be a distinction without a difference, since Ecuador, by signing the BIT, and Chevron, by consenting to arbitration, have created a separate binding agreement to arbitrate.\"73*\n\nR-247, pp. 12-13; CLA-435, p. 10.\n\n4.106.\n\n*(7) The Section 1782 Litigation (USA):* Beginning in December 2009, Chevron initiated numerous legal proceedings in several US District Courts in the USA under U.S.C. Section 1782 in order to obtain discovery for use in the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Veiga-P\u00e9rez Criminal Prosecutions and this arbitration. These proceedings were directed to (inter alios) Mr Donziger, Mr Berlinger, Mr Bonifaz, Mr Kohn, Mr Wray, Dr Calmbacher, Mr Champ, Mr Rourke, Stratus Consulting Inc., E-Tech and Banco Pichincha. The Respondent, in turn, later initiated legal proceedings in the USA under U.S.C. Section 1782 in order to obtain discovery for use in this arbitration, including (as later described in Part VII below) Mr Connor.\n\n4.107.\n\nTitle 28, Section 1782 of the U.S. Code permits a US district court, upon the application of any interested person, to order a person found or residing within the district \"to give testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal\". The factors to be considered in exercising this discretionary power are set out in the US Supreme Court's judgment in *Intel Corp. v Advanced Memo Devices Inc.* 542 US 241 (2004). Section 1782 does not apply to persons not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the USA.\n\n4.108.\n\nAs listed in the RICO Judgment (page 1), the reported US court decisions under Section 1782, relevant to the RICO Litigation and this arbitration, include the following *: In re Chevron Corp*., 709 F.Supp.2d 283 (S.D.N.Y.) (\"Berlinger 1782 I\"), aff'd sub nom., *Chevron Corp v. Berlinger*, 629 F.3d 297 (2d Cir.2010); *In re Chevron Corp*., 736 F.Supp.2d 773 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (\"Berlinger 1782 II\"); *In re Chevron Corp.*, 749 F.Supp.2d 135 (S.D.N.Y.)

Dec. 15 2010).74\n\nThe full list of these 23 or so applications appears in footnote 56 of Mr T. Boutros's article \"Ten Lessons from the Chevron Litigation: The Defense Perspective\", R-893.\n\n4.109.\n\n*(8) The RICO Litigation (New York*): This lawsuit was brought by Chevron on 1 February 2011 before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against Mr Donziger and the Law Offices of Steven R. Donziger (collectively, the \"Donziger defendants\"), Pablo Fajardo, Luis Yanza, Stratus Consulting, Douglas Beltman, Anne Maest, 47 of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and several others.75 Chevron claimed, as originally pleaded, damages and injunctive relief for a pattern of racketeering activity and violations of 18 USC Section 1962 and New York law.\n\nC-916.\n\n4.110.\n\nIt is unnecessary here to address the numerous interlocutory orders and judgments made in the RICO Litigation by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. As listed in the RICO Judgment, these include: *Chevron Corp. v. Donziger*, 768 F.Supp 581 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (\"Donziger I\") (granting preliminary injunction); *Chevron Corp v. Donziger*, No. 11 Civ.0691(LAK),2011 WL 979609 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.7,2011) (\"Donziger II\") (denying motion to transfer case to another judge); *Chevron Corp. v. Donziger*, No. 11 Civ. 0691 (LAK), 2011 WL 1408386 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2011) (\"*Donziger II*\") (denying stay pending appeal and other relief); *Chevron Corp. v. Donziger*, - F. Supp. 2d - 2011 WL 1465679 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2011) (\"*Donziger IV*\") (granting separate trial and expedited discovery on claim for declaratory judgment); *Chevron Corp. v. Donziger*, No. 11 Civ. 0691 (LAK), 2011 WL 1560926 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2011) (\"*Donziger V*\") (denying motion to stay certain aspects of preliminary injunction pending appeal); *Chevron Corp. v. Donziger*, - F. Supp. 2d -, No. 11 Civ. 0691 (LAK), 2011 WL 1747046 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2011) (\"*Donziger VI*\") (denying recusal motion); *Chevron Corp. v. Donziger*, No. 11 Civ. 0691 (LAK), 2011 WL 2150450 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2011) (\"*Donziger VII*\") (granting in part and denying in part motion to intervene); *Chevron Corp. v. Salazar*, No. 11 Civ. 3718 (LAK), 2011 WL 2326893 (S.D.N.Y. Jun. 14, 2011) (\"*Salazar I*\") (denying motion to stay pending intervention appeal); *Chevron Corp. v.

Supp. 2d -, 2011 WL 2556046 (S.D.N.Y. Jun. 28, 2011) (\"*Salazar III*\") (denying motion to compel deposition).\n\n4.111.\n\nThe RICO trial took place before the US District Court New York (Judge Kaplan) over seven weeks from 15 October to 26 November 2013. Its proceedings were recorded by verbatim transcript.76 The District Court issued its judgment on 4 March 2014 in favour of Chevron and against the Donziger defendants.77 Not counting its lengthy appendices, the RICO Judgment extends over 485 pages. Its conclusion reads in part: \"The saga of the Lago Agrio case is sad. It is distressing that the course of justice was perverted. The LAPs [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs] received the zealous representation they wanted, but it is sad that it was not always characterised by honor and honesty as well. It is troubling that \u2026. what happened here probably means that 'we'll never know whether or not there was a case to be made against Chevron' \u2026\"\n\nSee C-2365 to C-2384.\n\nC-2135 & 2136.\n\n4.112.\n\nOn 8 August 2016, the Second Circuit affirmed the Judgment of the US District Court; and it dismissed the appeal by the Donziger defendants.78 For this appeal, Ecuador (not being a disputing party) submitted to the Second Circuit an amicus brief dated 8 July 2014.79\n\nC-2540.\n\nC-2541; R-1222A.\n\n4.113.\n\nOn 19 June 2017, the US Supreme Court denied the Donziger defendants' petition of certiorari from the judgment of the Second Circuit,80 as notified by the Claimants' letter dated 29 June 2017 to the Tribunal.\n\nC-2542.\n\n4.114.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, the US District for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan) issued its judgment regarding the allocation and assessment of costs incurred by the Parties in the RICO Litigation, as reserved in the RICO Judgment.81 The Court ordered Mr Donziger to pay US$ 944,463.85 to Chevron towards its legal costs.\n\nSee C-2547.\n\n4.115.\n\n*(9) The Huaorani Litigation (New York) **:*** This lawsuit was brought before the New York Supreme Court on 2 September 2014 by Kempera Baihua Hunai and 41 others from the Huaorani community in the Oriente against the same Donziger defendants and the Amazon Defence Front. The plaintiffs, legally represented by Professor Judith Kimerling82, claimed from the Donziger defendants a proportional share in the proceeds of the Lago Agrio Judgment, pleading (inter alia) breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, constructive trust and ancillary relief.\n\nProfessor Kimerling has studied and written extensively on the indigenous peoples of the Amazon, since 1989. Several of her materials were submitted in evidence by the Parties: see (i) J. Kimerling, \"The Indigenous Peoples and the Oil Frontier in Amazonia: The Case of Ecuador, ChevronTexaco, and *Aguinda v Texaco*\" (2006) 38 New York University Journal of International Law and Politics 413: C-483; (ii) J. Kimerling, \"Disregarding Environmental Law: Petroleum Development in Protected Natural Areas and Indigenous Homelands in the Ecuadorian Amazon\" (1991) 14 Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 849: R-472; and (iii) J. Kimerling et. al, *Amazon Crude* (1991): R-473. For a time, Professor Kimerling was professionally involved as a consultant to the Aguinda Plaintiffs in the Aguinda Litigation in New York. She was not a witness in this arbitration.\n\n4.116.\n\nThe same plaintiffs had earlier applied to join, as interveners, in the RICO Litigation. The US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan) had denied their request by order dated 14 January 2013, leaving them \"free to pursue their claims in independent actions in the New York State and doubtless other courts.\" In this Huaorani litigation, the Donziger defendants were represented by Mr Steven Donziger. It appears that the ADF took no part in this litigation, not being subject to the non-consensual jurisdiction of the New York Courts *.*\n\n4.117.\n\nThe Huaorani complaint was described, in the first instance judgment of the New York Supreme Court, as follows:\n\n*\"\u2026 Broadly speaking, plaintiffs allege that Donziger and the ADF are seeking complete control of the proceeds of the Lago Agrio litigation, for their own benefit and to the detriment of the Huaorani \u2026 Plaintiffs allege that the Donziger defendants have \u2026 claimed to represent all of the indigenous people, including plaintiffs and other Huaorani, in activities related to the Lago Agrio. However, it is plaintiffs' position that plaintiffs never authorised such representation and that there is no written retainer agreement, nor any other agreement, which sets forth Donziger or ADF's obligations to plaintiffs in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation. Nevertheless, plaintiffs allege that as a result of Donziger's and ADF's representations that Donziger is counsel for plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio litigation and that ADF brought the Lago Agrio litigation on behalf of all of the Ecuadorian people harmed by Texaco's operations, including the Huaorani, the Donziger defendants and ADF owe plaintiffs a fiduciary duty, including a duty to protect their interests in the Lago Agrio litigation, a duty to notify plaintiffs of any arrangements with third parties (investors, funders, and/or the Republic of Ecuador) regarding the proceeds of the judgment, and a duty to notify plaintiffs of enforcement efforts, settlement negotiations or any other significant developments regarding the proceeds of the litigation.*\n\n*Plaintiffs claim, on information and belief, that the money that the Donziger defendants and ADF collect will be 'dissipated and funnelled to off-shore havens beyond the reach of US Courts and that the Donziger Defendants and ADF intend to assign away [the Huaorani's] interest in the Lago Agrio judgment in exchange for money'. It is plaintiffs' position that the Donziger defendants and ADF have agreements with investors and funders in exchange for interests in the judgments and that they have already collected more than $10 million by selling shares in the judgment, that the Republic of Ecuador expects to receive at least 90% of the proceeds of the judgment; and that the Donziger defendants and ADF intend to distribute the remaining proceeds of the judgment to lawyers and investors before passing the remaining money to Ecuadorian trusts controlled by ADF.\" (pp. 4-5).*\n\n4.118.\n\nWhilst opposing the Huaorani plaintiffs' complaint as regards both the Court's exercise of jurisdiction and the merits, the Donziger defendants are recorded, in the judgment, as accepting: \"that ADF agrees that the Huaorani people should benefit from the Lago Agrio litigation\" (p.12, footnote 1). The judgment also records that the ADF executed a retainer agreement with the Donziger defendants in New York (pp. 13 & 15-16). There is no similar reference to any retainer or other agreement with the individual Huaorani plaintiffs; and, indeed, the judgment refers to Mr Donziger's \"purported clients\", not \"clients\" (p. 15).\n\n4.119.\n\nBy its judgment issued on 29 August 2014, the New York Supreme Court stayed the lawsuit under the New York legal doctrine of forum non conveniens and dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint.83 The plaintiffs appealed to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. By its judgment issued on 16 June 2015, that Court affirmed the Supreme Court's order for a stay.84\n\nRLA-685.\n\nRLA-686.\n\n4.120.\n\nThe Huaorani Litigation is factually significant. First, it confirms that Mr Donziger, with his colleagues in Ecuador (including the ADF), had no written retainer or power of attorney to act in the Lago Agrio Litigation on behalf of any member of the Huaorani community as individuals. Second, it confirms that Mr Donziger and his Ecuadorian colleagues (including the ADF) intended that, nonetheless, the Lago Agrio Judgment should accrue (in part) for the benefit of the members of the Huaorani community as a whole.\n\n4.121.\n\nThe Tribunal here notes again the broad language of the Lago Agrio Complaint: it alleges legal injury to and relief for all affected persons within a large geographical area, including expressly members of the Huarani community.85 The Tribunal also notes that none of the named Aguinda Plaintiffs or the named Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were members of the Huaorani community.86 (These matters are relevant to the Tribunal's later consideration of the \"diffuse\" nature of Chevron's legal liability in the Lago Agrio Judgment, to which the Tribunal returns in Part V below)\n\nC-71, section III.\n\nSee C-483, p. 476 (as regards the Aguinda Complaint in New York); p. 631 (as regards the Lago Agrio Complaint).\n\n4.122.\n\n*(10) The Veiga-P\u00e9rez Criminal Prosecutions (Ecuador):* In 2003, the Respondent's Comptroller-General initiated criminal proceedings, later to become prosecutions, against (inter alios) Mr Veiga (a national of the USA) and Dr P\u00e9rez (a national of Ecuador). These proceedings are also called \"the criminal indictments\" in this arbitration.\n\n4.123.\n\nThese Criminal Prosecutions alleged \"falsity in a notarial instrument\" (later \"ideological falsehood\") under Articles 338 and 339 of the Ecuadorian Penal Code, committed by Mr Patricio Rivadeneira (the former Minister of Energy and Mines), Dr Ramiro Gordillo (the former Executive President of PetroEcuador), Mr Luis Alban Granizo (the former Manager of Petroproduccion), Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez (TexPet's Vice-President and legal representative, respectively). The alleged falsity concerned the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with associated documentation), signed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines, PetroEcuador and TexPet.\n\n4.124.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives co-operated with members of President Correa's administration to bring these prosecutions in an attempt to nullify the effect of Chevron's reliance upon the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a defence in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.125.\n\nFor example, in her email dated 10 February 2005 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, Dr Escobar described her meeting on 8 February 2005 with members of the Presidential Office, as follows:87\n\n*\"\u2026 I explained to Dr Gonz\u00e1lez [the Legal Under-Secretary General of the Presidential Office] that \u2026. [w]ith respect to the topic of the contract, I explained that the Attorney General's Office [sic] and all of us working on the State' s defense were searching for a way to nullify or undermine the value of the remediation contract and the final acta and that our greatest difficulty lay in the time that has passed.\"*\n\n(The \"remediation contract\" and \"final acta\" were references to the 1995 Settlement Agreement ad the 1998 Final Release. The \"State's defense\" referred to the pending AAA Arbitration in New York, described above).\n\nC-694.\n\n4.126.\n\nLater, in his email dated 10 February 2006 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, Mr Donziger stated \"\u2026 Now that we have the inspections schedule, it's time to request Ricardito [sic] Reis Veiga as a witness. Pablo [Fajardo] has the questions. We exploit that for the press to further create the image of fraud, to put a face on the fraud, perhaps during the mobilization and press conference about fraud. In the US it's going to be a bombshell with the press. We should set a date. Poor him \u2026\".88. In his email message dated 1 October 2007 to Messrs Prieto, Donziger, Yanza, Saenz and Ponce, Mr Fajardo stated: \" \u2026 Today I went to the Supreme Court to look for the file on the issue regarding the prosecutor's office \u2026 Now the file is being reviewed by one of the assistants to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Tomorrow we will meet with the Chief Justice of the Supreme [Court] to move this issue forward \u2026\".89\n\nC-777.\n\nC-743.\n\n4.127.\n\nBy its decision dated 9 August 2006, for want of any evidence of criminal conduct, the Office of the Prosecutor-General dismissed these criminal prosecutions.90 However, by its decision dated 31 March 2008, \"in the light of new elements\", the Office of the Prosecutor-General re-opened the criminal prosecutions.91\n\nC-234.\n\nC-247.\n\n4.128.\n\nOne of these elements included President Correa's visit to the former concession area in April 2007, organised by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. During his visit, the President was accompanied by Messrs Fajardo and Yanza. As reported by \"A-F.L./Presidential Press\":92\n\n*\"Today, President Rafael Correa called upon the District Attorney of Ecuador to allow a criminal case to be heard against the Petroecuador officers who approved the petroleum remediation in Ecuador's Amazonia performed by the multinational company, Texaco. The petition was made after a visit was made to the covered pits of Well 7 (Shushufindi), supposedly remediated by the oil company in the 1990s. Residents in the area said that the oil company did not solve the problem, rather just covered the crude waste pits with dirt. Those affected emphasized that the waste also contaminates the river around which indigenous communities traditionally live. Similarly, some residents in the area stated their complaints about the activities being carried out by Petroecuador in the area. One person reported to the president and the Minister of Health, Caroline Chang, on a disease he has, allegedly linked to oil activities, asking the government for help. During the president's visit, the visitors became familiar with some sites where oil waste remains in spite of the fact that an environmental remediation was carried out. The others who participated in this visit were the Minister of Health, Caroline Chang; the Minister of Tourism, Marfa Isabel Salvador; the Minister of the Environment, Ana Alban; the Minister of Energy, Alberto Acosta, Petroecuador's president, Carlos Pareja; and the Secretary of Communication, Monica Chuji.\"*\n\nC-242.\n\n4.129.\n\nBy its order dated 16 September 2008, the Supreme Court (First Criminal Division) decided that the prosecutorial record be sent to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, for trial.93 By order dated 19 September 2008, the President of the Court accepted the case for prosecution.94 Subsequently, by its lengthy opinion dated 29 April 2010 (based on 65 binders comprising 6,492 documents), the Office of the ProsecutorGeneral decided that there was relevant evidence of criminal conduct, by (inter alios) Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez, requesting that a summons for trial be issued to the defendants by the National Court of Justice (First Criminal Division).95 By its order dated 15 February 2011, the Court fixed 2 March 2011 as the date of the preliminary hearing in Quito.96 By its order dated 24 February 2011, the Court adjourned that hearing.97\n\nC-261.\n\nC-262.\n\nC-346.\n\nC-935.\n\nC-961.\n\n4.130.\n\nBy its order dated 1 June 2011, after the resumed preliminary hearing, the National Court of Justice (First Criminal Division) declared the nullity of the Criminal Prosecutions against (inter alios) Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez.98 By that date, the Lago Agrio Judgment and its Clarification Order had been issued (on 14 February and 4 March 2011).\n\nR-250.\n\n4.131.\n\nIn September 2013, the Respondent resumed criminal investigations of individuals who signed the 1995 Settlement Agreement and related documentation. These proceedings were and remain confidential under Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal has not been informed whether any of Chevron's representatives are the target of such investigations.99\n\nSee Track II Hearing D13.3031-3032; and see also the Claimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 19 March 2018.\n\n4.132.\n\n*(11) Enforcement Litigation (Ecuador)* : Since 30 May 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs have sought to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment in (i) Ecuador, (ii) Canada, (iii) Brazil and (iv) Argentina. As regards Canada, Brazil and Argentina, these enforcement proceedings have already been summarised in Annex 4 to Part I above.\n\n4.133.\n\nAs to Ecuador, on 1 March 2012, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court declared the Lago Agrio Judgment enforceable; on 3 August 2012, the Lago Agrio Court ordered Chevron to pay the judgment debt within 24 hours; and on 13 October 2012, the Lago Agrio Court ordered that the Lago Agrio Judgment's execution \"be applicable to the entirety of the assets of Chevron Corporation, until such time as the entire obligation has been satisfied.\" Assets subject to the attachment order included Chevron's subsidiaries' intellectual property assets in Ecuador (including certain trademarks owned by Chevron Intellectual Property LLC, indirectly owned by Chevron), bank accounts in Ecuador and bank transfers through the Ecuadorian banking system, in addition to the modest funds found in TexPet's bank account at Banco Pichincha in Ecuador (US$ 358.00). On 25 October 2012, the Court extended the attachment order to additional trademark and intellectual property in Ecuador indirectly owned by Chevron. (At the Track II Hearing, the Tribunal was informed that these trademarks in Ecuador had no commercial value).100\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,218-219.\n\n4.134.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, the Lago Agrio Court granted the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' application to garnishee the payment due from the Respondent to Chevron and TexPet under the awards issued in the Commercial Cases Arbitration.101 This order was notified to the Respondent under the Court's Order of 12 July 2016. On 21 July 2016, the Order was discharged by the Court upon the application to the Court by Mr Fajardo acting as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representative. With the Respondent's payment of the Commercial Cases awards to Chevron and TexPet on 22 July 2016, these garnishee proceedings came to an end without any benefit to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.\n\nC-1921; see also the Claimants' letters to the Tribunal dated 4 September 2013 and 19 March 2018, p. 7.\n\n4.135.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Plaintiffs have made further attempts to seize assets in Ecuador indirectly owned by Chevron under these attachment orders. For example, in two motions dated 30 January 2015, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs asked the Lago Agrio Court to instruct the Ecuadorian Intellectual Property Institute (\"EIPI\") to renew certain trademarks owned by Chevron Intellectual Property LLC and separately to order those trademarks embargoed pursuant to the Court's enforcement orders. On 5 April 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs requested the Court to appoint a depository to withdraw the funds that were seized from TexPet's bank account at Banco Pichincha. On 11 April 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs requested that the Court rule on the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' prior application for the EIPI to renew and embargo certain trademarks. On 12 July 2016, the Court refused these applications of 5 and 11 April 2016.\n\n4.136.\n\nTo date, no monies (apart, possibly, from the sum of US$ 358.00) have been recovered from Chevron, TexPet or its other subsidiaries in any enforcement proceedings of the Lago Agrio Judgment by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in Ecuador or elsewhere.\n\n4.137.\n\n*(12) The Gibraltar Litigation:* Chevron began legal proceedings in Gibraltar against certain non-party funders of the Lago Agrio Litigation and ostensible beneficiaries of and administrators for recoveries from the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgement, including Mr DeLeon, the Woodsford Group and other defendants. The defendants applied to strike out Chevron's action. The Gibraltar Court refused their application, with the Court expressing surprise in its judgment that the Ecuadorian Courts had not ordered a re-hearing of the Lago Agrio Litigation.102\n\nTrack II Hearing D.12.2767-2768.\n\n4.138.\n\n*(13) The Criminal Investigations (Ecuador):* The Respondent's criminal prosecutors initiated one or more investigations of specific individuals in the conduct of the Lago Agrio Litigation. As stated in the Respondent's letter of 21 July 2016 to the Tribunal and confirmed by its Counsel at the Track II Hearing,103 the details of these investigations were and remain confidential under the Criminal Code of Ecuador, even from the Respondent's Attorney-General.\n\nTrack II Hearing D13.3031-3032.\n\n4.139.\n\nOne such individual was Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez, with an investigation begun in 2009 for bribery (with others). These criminal investigations were closed in 2013.104 Another is Dr Guerra, begun in 2013.105 The Tribunal was informed by the Claimants that this criminal investigation remains pending.\n\nC-1917.\n\nSee the Claimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 19 March 2018, p. 4.\n\n4.140.\n\nTo date, no prosecution has been brought against Dr Zambrano, Dr Guerra or any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in Ecuador. However, as the Respondent stated, any criminal investigations into these individuals would be confidential under Ecuadorian law.\n\n4.141.\n\n*(14) This Treaty Arbitration (The Hague):* This arbitration was commenced by Chevron and TexPet against the Respondent by the Claimants' Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009 under the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"Notice of Arbitration\").\n\n4.142.\n\nThis Notice of Arbitration, which pre-dated the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011, claimed (inter alia) the following relief under the Treaty:\n\n*\" \u2026 (3) An order and award requiring Ecuador to inform the court in the Lago Agrio Litigation that TexPet, its parent company, affiliates, and principals have been released from all environmental impact arising out of the former Consortium's activities and that Ecuador and Petroecuador are responsible for any remaining and future remediation work;*\n\n*(4) A declaration that Ecuador or Petroecuador is exclusively liable for any judgment that may be issued in the Lago Agrio Litigation;*\n\n*(5) An order and award requiring Ecuador to indemnify, protect and defend Claimants in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation, including payment to Claimants of all damages that may be awarded against Chevron in the Lago Agrio Litigation;*\n\n*(6) An award for all damages caused to Claimants, including in particular all costs including attorneys' fees incurred by Claimants in defending the Lago Agrio Litigation and the criminal indictments; \u2026\".*\n\n4.143.\n\nThe Notice of Arbitration pleaded several events allegedly taking place within the Lago Agrio Litigation up to September 2010, amounting to a \"judicial farce\". These included allegations relating to Mr Cabrera (as the Lago Agrio Court's global expert) and the Cabrera Reports, as to which it alleged 'collaboration' with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. It also alleged gross misconduct by the Lago Agrio Court, including Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez's improper predisposition towards the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs (until his recusal in August 2009) and the Respondent's resort to the Veiga and P\u00e9rez Criminal Prosecutions, in collusion with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, in an attempt to subvert Chevron's defences based on the 1995 Settlement Agreement in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.144.\n\nFollowing the Notice of Arbitration, as and when new evidential materials became available to them, the Claimants supplemented their pleaded case against the Respondent, in accordance with procedural orders made by the Tribunal and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as did, conversely, the Respondent). In particular, by their Supplemental Memorial on the Merits of 20 March 2012, the Claimants introduced a new allegation that the Lago Agrio Court's judgment of 14 February 2011 (as issued by the Lago Agrio Court and affirmed and, on 1 March 2012, declared enforceable by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court) had been corruptly 'ghostwritten' by representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in collusion with Judge Zambrano. (The Tribunal returns to this allegation at length below).\n\n4.145.\n\nTo date, the Tribunal has made five awards in this arbitration: (i) the First Interim Award dated 25 January 2012; (ii) the Second Interim Award dated 16 February 2012; (iii) the Third Interim Award dated 27 February 2012; (iv) the Fourth Interim Award dated 7 February 2013; and (v) the First Partial Award on Track 1 dated 17 September 2013. It has also made 55 procedural orders, including its orders for interim measures dated 14 May 2010, 6 December 2010, 28 January 2011, 9 February 2011 and 16 March 2011. These awards and orders are listed in Annexes 1 and 3 to Part I above.\n\n4.146.\n\nThe Respondent applied to annul the Tribunal's five awards before the Hague District Court and Court of Appeal. The Hague District Court rejected the Respondent's applications, by its judgment dated 20 January 2016.106 By its judgment dated 18 July 2017,107 the Court of Appeal of The Hague confirmed the decision of the District Court \"with an improvement of the legal grounds\". The Respondent was entitled under Dutch law, to appeal from this judgment to the Supreme Court of The Netherlands (the \"Hoge Raad\").\n\nSee the Claimants' letters to the Tribunal dated 1 August 2017 and 19 March 2018, p. 2, and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 2.\n\nC-2545.\n\n4.147.\n\nBy letter dated 1 August 2017, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it was \"currently evaluating\" whether to initiate such an appeal. On 18 October 2017, the Respondent lodged a cassation appeal to the Hoge Raad. These appellate proceedings remain pending before the Hoge Raad, as of the date of this Award.108\n\nSee the Claimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 19 March 2018, p. 2, and the Respondent's letter to the Tribunal dated 20 April 2018, p. 2.\n\n4.148.\n\nBy letter dated 12 July 2017, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal \"terminate\" its First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards for the reasons there set out, principally because \"recent events in U.S. courts and in enforcement courts demonstrate that Chevron faces no current imminent threat of irreparable harm\" (pp. 4-5). By letter dated 19 July 2017, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's request. By its Procedural Order No 47 dated 31 October 2017, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's request for the reasons and upon the terms there set out.\n\n***H: The Tribunal's Annotated Chronology 1993-2018***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.149.\n\nThe Tribunal has found it necessary to set out the relevant facts, as it finds them on the evidence, in the form of an annotated chronology: from 1993 to the Lago Agrio Judgment and Clarification Order of 14 February and 4 March 2011; and from March 2011 to 2018. The events there described should be read with the documentary evidence referenced in the corresponding footnotes.\n\n4.150.\n\nAs regards an overall account of the Aguinda Litigation and the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Tribunal emphasises that these chronologies, albeit lengthy, are incomplete. They nonetheless suffice for the purpose of this Award.\n\n4.151.\n\nDocumentation in Spanish is here reproduced in English translations prepared by the Parties for the Tribunal.\n\n***1993***\n----------\n\n4.152.\n\n*3 November 1993* : As already indicated, the Aguinda Plaintiffs begin the Aguinda Litigation before the US Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, USA in 1993.109 It is a putative (not certified) class action pleading several torts against Texaco, in negligence, nuisance, strict liability, trespass, conspiracy and violations of the law of nations under the US Alien Tort Claims Act. The complaint is brought in New York because, at the time, Texaco's headquarters were located at White Plains, New York. It lists 76 named plaintiffs, including 15 Kichwa (including Maria Aguinda), 24 Secoya and 37 non-indigenous \"colonists\". There are no named plaintiffs from the Cof\u00e1n, Siona and Huaorani communities. However, the size of the putative class, estimated at 30,000 affected persons, is defined geographically to include members of these communities; but no class is ever certified by the Court.\n\nC-14\n\n4.153.\n\nTexaco denies any liability to the Aguinda Plaintiffs and applies to dismiss the proceedings on two grounds: (i) forum non conveniens (in favour of the Ecuadorian Courts) and (ii) the Aguinda Plaintiffs' failure to join as parties indispensable third persons (namely PetroEcuador and Ecuador).\n\n4.154.\n\nThe Aguinda Plaintiffs are represented in the Aguinda Litigation by US lawyers, including Mr Crist\u00f3bal Bonifaz, Mr Steven Donziger and Mr Joseph Kohn (of Kohn, Swift and Graf, a law firm in Philadelphia with significant financial resources). The case is assigned to Judge Broderick; he died in March 1995; and the case is then re-assigned to Judge Rakoff.\n\n***1994***\n----------\n\n4.155.\n\n*1994:* Between May and August 1994, four municipalities in the Oriente, Shushufindi, Francisco de Orellana (Coca), Lago Agrio and La Joya de los Sachas, begin legal proceedings against TexPet before the Ecuadorian Courts (the \"Municipal Lawsuits\"), seeking compensation for environmental harm and injuries to their communities allegedly caused by the former Consortium's operations and also orders requiring TexPet to remediate the alleged contamination within the area of the former Concession.110 In May 1995, as part of the consideration for the release under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, TexPet agrees to negotiate settlements of the Municipal Lawsuits. TexPet and the four Municipalities subsequently agree settlements in 1996, approved by the Ecuadorian Courts between May and September 1996.\n\nC-320 & C-321 (Shushufindi); C-325 (Orellana); C-323 (Lago Agrio); and C-322 (La Joya de los Sachas).\n\n4.156.\n\n*14 December 1994:* A Memorandum of Understanding is made between the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet (the \"MOU\").111 In summary, the MOU provides that the parties would develop a detailed scope of environmental remedial work; that TexPet would perform such work; and that, after the completion of such work, the parties would negotiate \"the full and complete release of TexPet's obligations for environmental impacts arising from the operations of the Consortium.\"112\n\nC-17.\n\nC-17, Article IV.\n\n***1995***\n----------\n\n4.157.\n\n*4 May 1995:* The Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet conclude the Settlement Agreement.113 It provides (inter alia): \"the scope of the Environmental Remedial Work to be undertaken by TexPet to discharge all of its legal and contractual obligations and liability [for] Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations has been determined and agreed to by TexPet, the Government and PetroEcuador as described in this Contract\"; the agreed scope of the environmental remedial work is attached as Annex A; and \"TexPet agrees to undertake such Environmental Remedial Work in consideration for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium's operations\".114\n\nC-23.\n\nC-23, Recitals, p. 3; Article 5.1. In Part III above, the Tribunal has set out more fully the relevant extracts from the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as also of the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases and the 1998 Final Release.\n\n4.158.\n\nBy Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent and PetroEcuador release, acquit and forever discharge TexPet and its fellow \"Releasees\" of \"all the Government's and Petroecuador's claims against the Releasees for Environmental Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium, except for those related to the obligations contracted hereunder for the performance by TexPet of the Scope of Work (Annex A) which shall be released as the Environmental Remedial Work is performed to the satisfaction of the Government and Petroecuador \u2026\". The Settlement Agreement thereby envisages a two-stage process for this release. First, all claims by the Respondent and PetroEcuador against the Releasees are released, excepting those covered by the Scope of Work; and, later, the latter are also released if the remedial work is performed by TexPet to the satisfaction of the Respondent and PetroEcuador.\n\n4.159.\n\nThe 1995 Settlement Agreement is signed for the Respondent by the Minister of Energy and Mines (Dr Galo Abril Ojeda), for PetroEcuador by its Executive President (Dr Fererico Vintimilla Ojeda) and for TexPet by its Vice-President (Mr Veiga) and its legal representative (Dr P\u00e9rez). Later, in February 2008, Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez were defendants in the Criminal Prosecutions brought by the Respondent in relation to the 1995 Settlement Agreements (see above).\n\n4.160.\n\nThe definition of \"Environmental Impact\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement is broad, including any \"solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present or released into the environment in such concentration or condition, the presence or release of which causes, or has the potential to cause harm to human health or the environment.\"115\n\nC-23, Article 1.3.\n\n4.161.\n\nBy Article 5.2, the definition of the \"claims\" to be released under the 1995 Settlement Agreement is also broad:\n\n*\"The Government and Petroecuador intend claims to mean any and all claims, rights to claims, debts, liens, common or civil law or equitable causes of actions and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or regulatory causes of action and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or regulatory causes of action or penalties (including, but not limited to, causes of action under Article 19-2 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador, Decree No. 1459 of 1971, Decree No. 925 of 1973, the Water Act, R.O. 233 of 1973, ORD No. 530 of 1974, Decree No.374 of 1976, Decree No. 101 of 1982, or Decree No 2144 of 1989, or any other applicable law or regulation of the Republic of Ecuador), costs, lawsuits, settlements and attorneys' fees (past, present, future, known or unknown), that the Government or Petroecuador have, or ever may have against each Releasee for or in any way related to contamination, that have or ever may arise in the future, directly or indirectly arising out of Operations of the Consortium, including but not limited to consequences of all types of injury that the Government or Petroecuador may allege concerning persons, properties, business, reputations, and all other types of injuries that may be measured in money, including but not limited to, trespass, nuisance, negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, or any other theory or potential theory of recovery.\"116*\n\nC-23, Article 5.2.\n\n4.162.\n\n*Effect:* As already decided by the Tribunal, as here confirmed, the 1995 Settlement Agreement was made by the Respondent, acting by its Government, including the Ministry of Energy and Mines: see the Tribunal's First Partial Award at paragraph 25.\n\n4.163.\n\n*8 September 1995:* The Remedial Action Plan, prepared by (inter alios) Woodward-Clyde International Inc (the \"RAP\"), is agreed by TexPet, PetroEcuador and the Respondent's Ministry of Energy and Mines.117\n\nR-610; Connor ER, p. 7.\n\n***1996***\n----------\n\n4.164.\n\n*May-September 1996:* The Municipal Settlements (also called the \"Municipal and Provincial Releases\") are agreed between TexPet and four municipalities in the Oriente (Shushufindi, Francisco de Orellana, Lago Agrio and La Joya de los Sachas), pursuant to Paragraph VII(C) of Annex A of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and approved by the Ecuadorian Courts.118\n\nC-27 to C-32 and C-35 to C-41.\n\n4.165.\n\nThe approved releases provide, in materially similar terms that the representatives of the municipality (here Lago Agrio):\n\n*\"\u2026 proceed to exempt, release, exonerate and relieve forever Texaco Petroleum Company, Texas Petroleum Company, Compan\u00eda Texaco de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador S.A., Texaco Inc., and any other affiliate, subsidiary or other related companies, and all their agents, employees, executives, directors, representatives, insurers, lawyers, guarantors, heirs, administrators, contractors, subcontractors, successors or predecessors, from any responsibility, claim, request, demand, or complaint, be it past, current, or future, for any and all reasons related to the actions, works or omissions arising from the activity of the aforementioned companies in the territorial jurisdiction of the Canton of Lago Agrio, Province of Sucumb\u00edos, which in part comprises the area of the oil concession \u2026*119\n\nC-30, p. 7 (settlement) and C-26 (court approval) for Lago Agrio.\n\n4.166.\n\nThe Tribunal has seen no evidence in this arbitration that any of these municipalities sought authority to settle the individual claims by any person for personal harm. As with the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal concludes that such individual claims were unaffected by these Municipal Settlements. Indeed, the Claimants have not here contended otherwise. (The Tribunal addresses the issue of \"diffuse\" claims separately below).\n\n4.167.\n\n*20 November 1996:* A \"waiver of rights\" is ostensibly granted in favour of the Respondent and PetroEcuador by the Aguinda Plaintiffs' representatives, Mr Bonifaz and Mr Kohn.120 It is made in the USA in the Spanish language before notaries public of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania (being the respective domiciles of Messrs Bonifaz and Kohn) by reference to the pending Aguinda Litigation in New York. Messrs Bonifaz and Kohn appear \"in their capacities as lead attorneys for the plaintiffs [in the Aguinda Litigation], with full legal capacity to execute this document on behalf of the plaintiffs and of all other U.S. lawyers who, on behalf of the plaintiffs, are involved in the case\n\nC-911.\n\n4.168.\n\nThe Tribunal has seen no evidence in this arbitration that Messrs Bonifaz and Mr Kohn sought or received express authority to settle individual claims by any person represented by them in the Aguinda Litigation (or to be represented by them in the later Lago Agrio Litigation). If it existed, given the terms of this waiver made by and on behalf of private persons, it would be limited to the plaintiffs named in the Aguinda Complaint advancing individual claims for personal harm; and, ostensibly at least, it would not extend to other persons not so named or any person alleging only \"diffuse\" rights.\n\n4.169.\n\nThe Respondent and PetroEcuador, as beneficiaries, are not signatories to the waiver, it being only there recorded that:\n\n*\"The Government of Ecuador, through its counsel, the Attorney General of Ecuador, Dr Leonidas Plaza Verduga, has decided to become involved in this case not as a party to the lawsuit [the Aguinda Litigation], but [on behalf] of the Republic of Ecuador consequently states that it is willing to allow execution in its territory of any environmental remediation measures the Court may order the defendant company to perform in accordance with the remedies the plaintiffs seek. At the same time Ecuador requests that the compensation sought in the abovementioned case be paid exclusively by TEXACO and that the Republic of Ecuador, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency not under any circumstance be required to pay such compensation.\"*\n\n4.170.\n\nUnder the waiver, the Aguinda Plaintiffs \"represented\" by Messrs Bonifaz and Kohn):\n\n*\"(1) \u2026 expressly waive the right to file any claim against the Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency, if in any eventuality the Federal Court of New York attributes to Ecuador or to the other institutions mentioned, any part of the compensation claimed by the plaintiffs for personal or environmental damage generated by the oil production activity TEXACO carried out in Ecuador.\"*\n\n*(2) This waiver includes the impossibility of filing any court action against the Ecuadorian State, Petroecuador and its affiliate companies, or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency, whether in the United States of America or in Ecuador, claiming payment of any compensation that the Court of the Southern District of New York or other U.S. Court might impose upon the Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency on account of the acts that form the basis for the Aguinda v. TEXACO case.*\n\n*(3) If TEXACO were to sue the Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies, or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency in U.S. court to obtain a contribution to any possible judgment against TEXACO in the U.S. District Court of New York, then we will reject any decision that the New York Court makes in said regard in favor of TEXACO, and we expressly waive the right to collect any amount whatsoever arising from such decision.*\n\n*(4) In addition, we agree to cooperate and at all times assist the attorneys of the Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency / the Ecuadorian Government in the Aguinda v. TEXACO case.\"*\n\n4.171.\n\nAs between the Respondent and the Aguinda Plaintiffs, the Respondent was thereby ostensibly immunised by the terms of this waiver. It is not clear to the Tribunal whether it was intended that the Respondent was thereby to become immune from the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims in the subsequent Lago Agrio Litigation. Whether or not that was so as a matter of any applicable law or laws, such was nevertheless the factual position. In the US Section 1782 Litigation, Mr Bonifaz later testified that it would have been futile for the Aguinda Plaintiffs to try to sue the Respondent in Ecuador: \"\u2026 the fact is that you can sue Ecuador; you're never going to be able to collect.\"121 Mr Donziger also stated, as privately recorded on film on 16-17 November 2007 in Ecuador, that \"the government here will never pay for any judgment\".122\n\nC-1220, at 19-20.\n\nC-360, Crude Outtakes, CRS-116-01-CLIP-01, p. 139 [03:20-03:30].\n\n4.172.\n\nIt is nonetheless clear that the waiver could have no legal effect on claims against the Respondent or PetroEcuador by Texaco (or by TexPet and Chevron), both in the USA and Ecuador. However, it is common ground that such a claim could not be made by Chevron against PetroEcuador or the Respondent within the Lago Agrio Litigation, being \"summary proceedings\" as a matter of Ecuadorian civil procedure.123\n\nTrack II Hearing D13.2938.\n\n4.173.\n\nThe Tribunal records its disquiet at the paucity of the evidence regarding this waiver. It is possible that its purpose may have been limited in scope and time, given the pending controversy before the US District Court (Judge Rakoff) in New York over the application by the Respondent and PetroEcuador to intervene in the Aguinda Litigation as co-plaintiffs, supporting the Aguinda Plaintiffs, and Texaco's opposition to that application (see above).\n\n4.174.\n\nMr Bonifaz testified, in the US Section 1782 Litigation, that the waiver had originated from a comment by Judge Rakoff that, if the Respondent did intervene in the Aguinda Litigation, \"Texaco might bring counterclaims against it\".124 According to Mr Bonifaz, the waiver was drafted by the Respondent; and: \"There's no question there was a quid pro quo here. In other words, okay, Mr Leonidas Plaza [the Respondent's AttorneyGeneral at the time], I'll sign this thing and you intervene in New York. Well, that government lasted one year. And once the old government lasted a year, the government all of a sudden wrote a letter to the court - the new government of Alarc\u00f3n [President Fabian Alarc\u00f3n] wrote a letter to the court saying something to the effect that we're not going to intervene; we're backing off out of that intervention, but we are going to support the plaintiffs.\"125\n\nC-1220, p. 14.\n\nC-1220, p. 33.\n\n4.175.\n\nIn any event, whatever the explanation for this waiver, on 12 August 1997, the US District Court (Judge Rakoff) denies the application by Ecuador to intervene in the Aguinda Litigation. This order is not vacated by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.126\n\nSee C-291, p. 2.\n\n4.176.\n\n*12 November 1996:* The US District Court (Judge Rakoff) grants Texaco's application to stay the Aguinda Plaintiffs' complaint.127 (This decision was later reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 5 October 1998: see below).\n\nC-477.\n\n***1997***\n----------\n\n4.177.\n\n*11 May 1997:* The Ecuador-USA Treaty (or BIT) agreed in 1993 comes into effect on 11 May 1997.128\n\nC-279.\n\n***1998***\n----------\n\n4.178.\n\n*30 September 1998:* The Final Release is issued, signed by PetroEcuador, the Ministries and TexPet (the \"Acta Final\"),129 after 52 RAP Actas and 19 Approval Actas.130 In summary, within the former concession area, a total of 250 pits and 7 spills at 133 well sites in 10 fields had been investigated under the RAP, with remedial action taken at 168 of these locations; and the balance (of 89) not subjected to remedial action because it was not required under the RAP.131\n\nC-457.\n\nConnor ER1, p. 7; Track II Hearing D6.1295-1297 (Slide 9).\n\nC-43, section 3.1 *.*\n\n4.179.\n\nWhilst there was later much disquiet within the Respondent's Government as to the making of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with the 1998 Final Release), there is no cogent evidence before this Tribunal that TexPet (or Texaco) violated the terms of the 1995 Settlement, the RAP or any Acta.\n\n4.180.\n\nTo the contrary, Mr Giovanni Rosania Schiavone, the Respondent's Under-Secretary of Environmental Protection (1995-1996) testified in this arbitration, as to his signing of Actas:\n\n*\"Q.\u2026. The signing of those Actas represented to your knowledge and expertise and opinion that the work TexPet had promised to do was done successfully and completely with respect to the Acta that you signed? A. That's correct. The technical work \u2013 I insist the technical work and environmental work was done well, and we accepted that the problem had been corrected, environmental problem in that area had been corrected.\"132*\n\nNovember Hearing D1,146.\n\n4.181.\n\nIn May 2006, Mr Manuel Mu\u00f1oz as the Director of DINAPA (the National Environmental Protection Management of the Ministry of Energy) was to inform a Commission of the Congress:\n\n*\"I would like to share with you some very important news which are very interesting but have not come to public notice. Petroproducci\u00f3n [PetroEcuador] was left with a very considerable debit side derived from the pits left by Texaco. Texaco completed the remediation of the pits that were their responsibility; this was 33% of the total. However, Petroecuador, during more than three decades, had done absolutely nothing with regard to the pits that were the state-owned company's responsibility to remediate.\"133*\n\nC-58, p. 1.\n\n4.182.\n\nIn July 2006, in her expert report to the Office of the Prosecutor, Ms Adriana Enriquez Sanchez was to conclude:\n\n*\"The purpose of this examination was to determine whether the surface of the pits remediated according to the RAP have seeps of oil or any sort of hydrocarbons that might endanger human health, flora or fauna. The Technical-Visual examination was conducted on the pits at certain oil wells in the following fields: Sacha, Shushufindi, Guanta and Lago Agrio \u2026 The surface of the soil in the remediated pits contains a great deal of organic material and there is no evidence of hydrocarbons, for which reason it does not represent a risk to human life, flora or wildlife. Similarly, no remains or leaks of hydrocarbons into the soil around the pits could be seen.\"134*\n\nC-592, p. 3.\n\n4.183.\n\nLater, in his email to Mr Donziger dated 1 August 2008, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' expert, Mr Beltman, was to state: \"I did not find any clear instances where TexPet did not meet the conditions required in the cleanup.\"135 (This email message is quoted more fully in the chronology below, under \"1 August 2008\").\n\nC-2043, p. 2.\n\n4.184.\n\n*5 October 1998:* The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reverses the decision of Judge Rakoff and remits the Aguinda Litigation to him.136 In May 2001, Judge Rakoff again stays the Aguinda Plaintiffs' complaint, in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction.137\n\nR-29.\n\nC-10.\n\n***1999***\n----------\n\n4.185.\n\n*1999:* The Environmental Management Act 1999 is enacted in Ecuador (the \"EMA\").\n\n***2001***\n----------\n\n4.186.\n\n*9 October 2001:* Texaco Inc. merges with Keepep Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, with Texaco Inc. emerging as the surviving corporation in the merger and becoming a direct subsidiary of Chevron Corporation,138 and with the parent company changing its name in turn to \"ChevronTexaco Corporation\".139 (In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation drops the name \"Texaco\" and is (re-) named Chevron Corporation). It is necessary, given the terms of the Lago Agrio Judgment, to describe more fully the form and effect of this merger under its applicable law, the laws of Delaware, USA.\n\nC-68, C-69, C-70.\n\nC-69, p. 2.\n\n4.187.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the written testimony of Mr Frank Soler.140 He was personally involved for Chevron in the implementation of the Agreement and Plan of Merger of 15 October 2000 between Chevron, Texaco and Keepep Inc. (the \"Agreement and Plan of Merger\")141 under a legal procedure known under the laws of Delaware as a \"reverse triangular merger\". At all material times, Chevron, Texaco and Chevron's subsidiary, Keepep Inc, were companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.\n\nSoler WS, paras 9-26. Mr Soler's witness statement, as also Professor Allen's expert report (see below), were adduced by the Claimants in support of their submissions as to the legal effects of \"merger\" in C-TI Rep. Mer. Aug. 2012, paras 177-185.\n\nSoler WS, para 4.\n\n4.188.\n\nMr Soler testified that on 9 October 2001, Texaco merged with Keepep Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron, in accordance with Section 1.1 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger; Texaco emerged as the surviving corporation from its merger with Keepep Inc; and, as a result, Texaco became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Chevron; Chevron's stock in Keepep Inc. was converted into stock in Texaco, while each share of Texaco common stock held by Texaco's shareholders was converted into the right to receive 0.77 shares of Chevron's common stock, which equated in value to approximately US$ 38,012 billion.\n\n4.189.\n\nIn accordance with Section 2.l(a) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, so Mr Soler testified, Chevron changed its name to \"ChevronTexaco Corporation\"; Texaco continued to exist as a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco Corporation; and the change in name from \"Chevron Corporation\" to \"ChevronTexaco Corporation\" did not affect Chevron's corporate structure.\n\n4.190.\n\nThus, according to Mr Soler, with this \"merger\", Chevron acquired all of Texaco's stock; Chevron did not acquire any of Texaco's assets or liabilities (because Texaco remained a separate corporation); and Texaco retained ownership of all of its assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of ownership interests in Texaco's subsidiary companies, including TexPet.\n\n4.191.\n\nThe legal effects of this \"reverse triangular merger\" were the subject of expert testimony by Professor William T. Allen, formerly the Chancellor (or Chief Judge) of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. In his expert report,142 Professor Allen testified that under Delaware law, Chevron did not assume or otherwise become liable for any obligations of Texaco as a result of the \"merger\"; the judicial doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, under Delaware law, does not impose upon Chevron liability for any obligations of Texaco relating to events that occurred prior to the date of the \"merger\"; Chevron had no capacity to \"control and dominate\" the management of Texaco prior to the \"merger\"; the \"merger\" itself did not constitute any wrong to then existing or future creditors of Texaco, since under Delaware law, which governed the effects of the \"merger\", those persons were left in precisely the same position vis-a-vis Texaco's assets and liabilities as they were before the \"merger\"'; and those assets and liabilities remained unaffected by the \"merger\".\n\nAllen ER, sections 3-8.\n\n4.192.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the factual testimony of Mr Soler and, as to the laws of Delaware, the expert testimony of Professor Allen. It concludes that, as a matter of Delaware law, Chevron did not succeed to the liabilities of Texaco or TexPet incurred before the merger in 2001, including liabilities resulting from their respective activities in Ecuador from 1964 to 1992.\n\n***2002***\n----------\n\n4.193.\n\n*16 August 2002:* The stay of the Aguinda Litigation in New York takes effect, with Texaco's undertaking in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction and the dismissal of the Aguinda Plaintiffs' appeal from the decision of Judge Rakoff by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.143\n\nC-65.\n\n***2003***\n----------\n\n4.194.\n\n*7 May 2003:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs file their Complaint in the Lago Agrio Court in Ecuador against \"Texaco Inc.\" as the only named defendant in the title page (\"the Lago Agrio Litigation\").144\n\nC-71.\n\n4.195.\n\nThe Complaint is drafted by Mr Alberto Wray, the senior Ecuadorian lawyer acting for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in Ecuador. He testified: \"I wrote the claim submitted in Lago Agrio in 2003 by the members of the 'Frente de Defensa de la Amazonia' ('the plaintiffs') \u2026 As the author of the Complaint, I intended to preserve to the extent possible the claims that had been raised and pursued in the *Aguinda* case in New York. Since Ecuadorian law does not contemplate an equivalent of a class action, I based the claims on, *inter alia*, Article 2260 of the Civil Code,145 which grants any individual or group of individuals a right of action to compel the removal of any threat of damage, including an environmental threat.\"146\n\nArticle 2236 of the Civil Code (formerly Article 2260) of the Civil Code provides (in the original Spanish and in its English translation): \"*Por regla general se concede acci\u00f3n popular en todos los casos de da\u00f1o contingente que por imprudencia o negligencia de alguno amenace a personas indeterminadas. Pero si el da\u00f1o amenazare solamente a personas determinadas, s\u00f3lo alguna de \u00e9stas podr\u00e1 intentar la acci\u00f3n*.\" (\"*As a general rule, a popular action is granted in all cases of contingent harm which, due to recklessness or negligence of a party threatens undetermined persons. But if the harm threatened only determined persons, only one of these may pursue the action.*\"). The relevant texts of the Civil Code are set out in Part III of this Award, above.\n\nWray WS, paras 3, 5.\n\n4.196.\n\nAs the Tribunal decided in its Decision on Track IB (by a majority), the Complaint includes both claims made by individuals for personal harm (not being diffuse claims) and diffuse claims.\n\n4.197.\n\nAt this time, the assigned judge in Lago Agrio is Judge Guerra, as the President of the Superior Court of Nueva Loja (the \"Lago Agrio Court\").\n\n4.198.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the title page for the court file on the Lago Agrio Litigation was mistakenly prepared by the Lago Agrio Court clerk and that the correct name of the defendant should have been \"ChevronTexaco Corporation\", as appears from page 7 of the Complaint.147 For ease of reference, the Tribunal refers to this defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation as \"Chevron\". Texaco and TexPet are not named parties to the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\nTrack II Hearing D13.2920-2962.\n\n4.199.\n\nChevron was therefore the sole defendant named in the Lago Agrio Litigation. At first sight, it was a strange decision by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Chevron itself had never done business in Ecuador; nor had it participated in any capacity under the 1964 or 1973 Concession Agreements; nor was it a signatory party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement (including the 1998 Final Release). At this time, Chevron and its subsidiaries had no significant assets in Ecuador. Under US and Delaware laws, as its personal law, Chevron was and remained a legally distinct and separate company from both Texaco and TexPet.\n\n4.200.\n\nLater, Mr Donziger complained that the Lago Agro Plaintiffs' senior Ecuadorian lawyer (Mr Alberto Wray) had made a mistake in naming \"the wrong party\" as the defendant: \"\u2026 This goes back to Alberto's errors: suing the wrong party in the complaint, then asking for too many inspections rather than controlling the process, capitulating on the field lab at the first complaint, letting work visa slide at first inspection, signing the Plan of Analysis \u2013 most all of these a function of his inability to take on the TEX [Texaco] lawyers and take control of the litigation.\"148\n\nC-716, p. 85 of 111 (24 January 2006).\n\n4.201.\n\nMr Wray ceased acting as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' senior lawyer in June 2005, when Mr Donziger assumed a more prominent role, together with Mr Fajardo and Mr Luis Yanza. Mr Wray had no participation in the Lago Agrio Litigation as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' \"procurador\" after February 2006.149 As Mr Donziger later testified in his US deposition in the RICO Litigation, in response to the question whether Mr Wray's role had then been terminated or reduced: \"I wouldn't say reduced. I would say it evolved to something different \u2026 when the case began in Ecuador, he [Mr Wray] was the procurador common, which is the position that Pablo Fajardo occupies today [December 2010], and there came a time when he [Mr Wray] didn't want to continue in that role for a variety of reasons, so he evolved into a different role, where he was, I would say, more eminent \u2013 he would sort of advise the lawyers on the Lago Agrio team about Ecuadorian law issues.\"150 (The Tribunal has seen no evidence connecting Mr Wray with any improper conduct alleged by the Claimants against the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives).\n\nWray WS, para 6.\n\nC-697, pp. 609-610.\n\n4.202.\n\nIn any event, the named defendant in the Lago Agrio Complaint is never amended by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. The sole defendant remains Chevron, allegedly standing in the shoes of Texaco and TexPet as result of the \"merger\" between Chevron and Texaco in 2001.\n\n4.203.\n\nAs already indicated above, in this Award the Tribunal refers to the defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation as \"Chevron\", although others at the time also referred to it as \"Chevron-Texaco\" and \"Texaco\".\n\n4.204.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' technical experts are to include Mr David Russell (subsequently replaced by Stratus Consulting), Mr Douglas Beltman (of Stratus Consulting), Dr Anne Maest (also of Stratus Consulting), Dr Charles Calmbacher (used as the first judicial inspection expert), Mr Edison Camino, Dr Castro and Mr Oscar Davila (used as experts for the judicial inspections).\n\n4.205.\n\n*13 May 2003* : The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Guerra) assumes jurisdiction over the Lago Agrio Complaint, ruling against Chevron's jurisdictional objection. Judge Guerra orders the case to proceed as a summary verbal proceeding under the provisions of Article 43 of the Environmental Management Act 1999 and Articles 843 et seq of the Code of Civil Procedure.151 As already indicated, it is common ground between the Parties that such a summary proceeding does not allow Chevron to implead PetroEcuador.152\n\nC-492.\n\nSee Track II Hearing D12.2605; C-Mem. Mer. Sept. 2010, para 176, citing Coronel ER1, para 114.\n\n4.206.\n\n*June 2003* : At this time, when Mr Fajardo had not yet joined the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' legal representatives, Mr Fajardo writes, as later recorded in the Final Report FLACSO-PetroEcuador Project Phase II of November 2003 \"on the socio-environmental conflicts at the Sacha and Shushufindi fields (1994-2002)\":\n\n*\"They [Petroproducci\u00f3n and PetroEcuador ] are not trustworthy because Petro does not practice what it preaches. Even since Texaco left, Petro has caused more damages and far more disasters than Texaco itself. But that is not what they say at all. Therefore, there are frequent spills and pipe breaks, and swamps, rivers and marshlands become contaminated to a large extent. But as this is a state-owned company and these people are linked with the legal system and everything, no one says a thing.\"153*\n\nMr Fajardo is described in the Report as the president of the Shushufindi Human Rights Commission and legal advisor of the Frente de Defensa de la Amazon\u00eda.\n\nC-184, p. 77.\n\n4.207.\n\n*21 October* 2003: A \"conciliation hearing\" is held before Judge Guerra on 21 October 2003. At this hearing, Chevron files its Response to the Lago Agrio Complaint. Its response, inter alia, challenges the jurisdiction of the Lago Agrio court over Chevron and, without prejudice to its jurisdictional challenge, also responds to the substance of the Complaint.154\n\nC-72.\n\n4.208.\n\n*29 October 2003* : The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Guerra) orders an \"expertise\" in two phases. The first phase is to involve the carrying out of judicial inspections of 25 sites requested by Chevron and 97 sites requested by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Each side would appoint their own experts to conduct these inspections. The second phase, requested by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, envisages: \"an expert examination intended to confirm the environmental effects of hydrocarbon production activities in all the fields used by TEXACO for production in its role as operator of the Consortium \u2026 this same procedure shall have the participation of Experts appointed and installed for the inspection noted in subheading I\u2026\".155\n\nC-176, pp. 6-7.\n\n***2004***\n----------\n\n4.209.\n\n*7 August 2004:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and Chevron agree terms of reference in the Lago Agrio Litigation, contemplating that the Lago Agrio Court would appoint a panel of independent settling experts [\"dirimentes\"] to resolve any differences between the reports of the experts of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and Chevron conducting the judicial inspections.156 The parties' agreement is recorded in a 91-page document, comprising: (i) terms of reference for the experts who would be carrying out the judicial inspections; (ii) a detailed sampling plan; (iii) ten \"standard operating procedures\" covering the taking of different samples from various locations, the decontamination of equipment etc; and (iv) an analysis plan, prepared in accordance with USEPA guidelines [\"USEPA\" denotes the United States Environmental Protection Agency], which covered (inter alia) data quality objectives, data validation and laboratory procedures.157\n\nC-177, pp. 1-2.\n\nC-177.\n\n4.210.\n\n*26 August 2004* : The Lago Agrio Court (now Judge Novillo) orders the parties to comply with the agreed terms of reference.158\n\nC-496.\n\n4.211.\n\n*Summer 2004:* The judicial site inspections begin in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.212.\n\nAt first, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs send their samples to be tested at a laboratory in the USA, Analytical Services Inc. However, this proves unsatisfactory because of the time that samples are held before analysis and also because the samples are inspected upon entry into the USA, which breaks the chain of custody. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs then use the Catolica laboratory in Quito and subsequently a laboratory in Quito called HAVOC.159 The latter became a subject of major controversy between the parties.\n\nC-186, pp. 55-59.\n\n4.213.\n\nDuring the course of 2004, Dr Calmbacher carries out judicial inspections at Sacha 6, Sacha 21, Sacha 94 and Shushufindi 48 for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.160 Later, Dr Calmbacher testified that certain expert reports submitted in his name by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives during the judicial inspections were falsified by them, and that the sites that he inspected, in fact, did not indicate a danger to human health or pose a risk to the environment.161\n\nC-186, p. 60.\n\nC-186, pp. 61-63; 112-115; 117; 135.\n\n4.214.\n\n*I November 2004:* In his email message to Mr Donziger of 1 November 2014, reporting on sampling analyses, Mr David Russell (of Global Environmental Operations, as one the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' environmental experts) writes: \"\u2026 Based upon a meeting in New York with the Attorneys on Thursday of last week, we need to stop analysing for BTEX and GRO. TPH and DRO are fine, but the analysis and reporting of GRO and BTEX data is self-defeating except to show that the contamination is much more recent that we would desire, and that would lead to an argument that the contamination is by PetroEcuador rather than Texaco. This is especially true for BTEX Data. \u2026\".162\n\nC-2044 (\"BTEX\" denotes Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene; \"TPH\" denotes Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons; \"GRO\" denotes Gasoline Range Organics; \"DRO\" denotes Diesel Range Organics; and \"RRO\" denotes Residual Range Organics).\n\n4.215.\n\nIt will be recalled that TexPet had left Ecuador in 1992 and that, ostensibly, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had \"waived\" their rights against PetroEcuador on 20 November 1996 (see above). PetroEcuador continued operations in the former concession area by itself, from 1992 onwards.\n\n4.216.\n\n*27 November 2004:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Ecuadorian lawyer, Mr Alberto Wray, writes to Mr Donziger that the first two judicial inspection reports by Dr Calmbacher show that \"hydrocarbons are below detection limits\" and do \"not help\" the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' case.163\n\nC-1192.\n\n4.217.\n\n*27 December 2004:* In his memorandum of 27 December 2004 to Mr Donziger, Mr Russell states, as regards DROs:\n\n*\"Now what we are analyzing is TPH and DRO. That leaves RRO, GRO, and NNO as unknowns. If you will recall, we stopped analyzing GRO at Cristobal's insistence because it helps Texaco prove their case. The problem comes in when we look for components of the DROs which are harmful. The PAH, or Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbon compounds. These compounds are powerful carcinogens, and if present in quantity would amount to a slam dunk for proving harm to people. The problem is that so far, they are not there or are not detected, even after we lower the detection limit \u2026 Right now, we can't prove harm except by inference and claims that TPH is harmful, that DRO is harmful, and that RRO.s are harmful. But the problem is that there is nothing specific.\"164*\n\nC-1032.\n\n***2005***\n----------\n\n4.218.\n\n*11 February 2005:* Mr Russell notes in an email message dated 11 February 2005 to Mr Donziger:\n\n*\"From the data I have seen so far, we are not finding any of the highly carcinogenic compounds one would hope to find when investigating the oil pits. That does not discount the findings of the metals, but I fear that may not be enough. I believe that we need a big smoking gun which will link Chevron-Texaco to cancer in and through the oil, and not through just the drilling muds and chrome and other heavy metals. There are two possible reasons for the lack of finding organic carcinogenic compounds in the oils at this time: 1) the compounds (primarily PAH) have been fully degraded or 2) because the compounds are soluble, they may have escaped the pits and are found in the groundwater outside the pit areas. Either or both of these scenarios are possible. We won't know until we begin a comprehensive look for the compounds outside the pit areas, and examine the groundwater closely.\"165*\n\nC-1050.\n\n4.219.\n\nMr Russell is subsequently dismissed as an expert by Mr Donziger and replaced by experts from Stratus Consulting. Later, on 14 February 2006, Mr Russell instructs Mr Donziger to cease using his (Mr Russell's) original estimate of clean-up costs of US$ 6.14 billion because it was \"too high by a substantial margin, perhaps by a factor of ten or more\" (see below).\n\n4.220.\n\n*10 August 2005:* Dr Martha Escobar Koziel (of the office of the Attorney General of Ecuador) sends an email message dated 10 August 2005 to Mr Wray, Mr Bonifaz and others regarding the nullification of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Final Release, following a visit by Chevron's representatives to the President.166 It states, in material part:\n\n*\"On the afternoon of August 8, I was in the Office of the President of the Republic; Dr Gonzalez, the Legal Undersecretary General, invited me to a meeting to discuss TEXACO; he confirmed that the previous week (he did not say what day) high-ranking TEXACO officials had been there; he did not give me names either, but he indicated that there had been a Brazilian (must be Reis Vega), an Argentine, a bearded American (he said he was a lawyer), and Dr P\u00e9rez (who has always been the legal representative in Ecuador) and an official from the Ministry of Energy and Mines (whose name he did not know because he did not leave his card). According to Dr Gonzalez, he and Max Donoso received them and later they spoke for a few minutes with the President of the Republic.*\n\n*In the meeting, both the Ministry official as well as those from Texaco left an \"Aide Memoire\" (I have a copy of the Ministry's, but so far they have not sent me Texaco's). The purpose of the visit - says Gonzalez - was to propose that the State intervene in the Sucumb\u00edos trial and allege the existence of the environmental remediation contract and the final acta de entrega-recepcion [i.e. delivery-receipt], or that a public declaration be made at the highest levels on the existence and fulfilment of that contract; in exchange, TEXACO would be willing to drop the arbitration in New York [i.e. the AAA arbitration]. They also expressed their total disagreement with the State having contracted lawyers linked to the indigenous plaintiffs.*\n\n*According to Dr Gonzalez, both he and the President of the Republic told TEXACO that they would transmit the proposal to the State's Attorney General, given that it is an autonomous entity and they should not confuse the attorney of the State with the attorney of the President of the Republic, and that the invitation they extended to me was precisely for that reason.*\n\n*I explained to Dr Gonzalez that the decision to accept the sponsorship of Terry Collingsworth and Cristobal was an economic one since it did not cost the State anything.167* *With respect to the topic of the contract, I explained that the Attorney General's Office and all of us working on the State's defense were searching for a way to nullify or undermine the value of the remediation contract and the final acta and that our greatest difficulty lay in the time that has passed.*\n\n*I have not managed to speak to the Attorney General since Monday, but I am sure that he will not accept the proposal. The Attorney General remains resolved to have the Comptroller's Office conduct another audit (that also seems unlikely to me given the time); he wants to criminally try those who executed the contract (that also seems unlikely to me, since the evidence of criminal liability established by the Comptroller's Office was rejected by the prosecutor).\"168*\n\nThis President was President Palacio (not President Correa). Ms Escobar was one of the lawyers assigned by the Respondent to assist outside counsel in the proceedings between Chevron and Ecuador in New York: see Track II Hearing D13.2802.\n\nMr Crist\u00f3bal Bonifaz and Mr Terry Collingsworth (representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs) were simultaneously acting for the Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador in the legal proceedings in New York to stay the AAA Arbitration.\n\nC-166.\n\n4.221.\n\n*29 September 2005:* In his email message to Mr Kohn, acknowledging the legal impediment posed by the 1995 Settlement Agreement to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims, Mr Donziger notes: the \"idea is to use it [i.e. fraud] to convince the government to take action against Chevron to nullify the remediation contract \u2026 this could be very important.\"169 This \"remediation contract\" was a reference to the 1995 Settlement Agreement (including the 1998 Final Release); and the \"fraud\" referred to the criminal prosecution for fraud against those persons who had signed the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Final Release (including, particularly, Mr Veiga and Dr Per\u00e9z as TexPet's representatives).\n\nC-874.\n\n4.222.\n\n*4 October 2005:* Mr Donziger records in his diary that: \"We pitched the criminal case to Archie [Archie Avila, an Ecuadorian lawyer]. Idea to pressure the company, get major press in US via Lehane [Christopher Lehane, a US attorney], and compel the Ec gov [Ecuadorian Government] to act against the company legally to nullify the remediation contract.\"170\n\nC-716, p. 108 of 112 (4 October 2005).\n\n4.223.\n\n*6 October 2005:* In his diary, Mr Donziger notes: \"The key issue is [the] criminal case. Can we get that going? What does it mean? I really want to consolidate control with contract [the 1995 Settlement Agreement] before going down a road that I think could force them to the table for a possible settlement \u2026 RV [Mr Reis Veiga] likely will be knocked out of the box by the criminal investigation and being called as a witness.\"171\n\nC-716, p. 105 of 112 (6 October 2005).\n\n4.224.\n\n*18 November 2005:* At this time, Mr Donziger agrees to pay covertly, as a bribe, Mr Fernando Reyes and Mr Gustavo Pinto to act nominally as \"independent experts\" for the purpose of monitoring the settling experts, but answerable to him.172 In his diary entry for 18 November 2005, Mr Donziger notes: \"Deal with Gustavo Pinto \u2013 feel like I have gone over to the dark side. First meeting like that that I was not eaten alive. Made modest offer, plus bonus. Agreed to keep it between us, no written agreement. Independent monitoring.\"173\n\nC-1632, para 11.\n\nC-716, p. 98 of 111 (18 November 2005).\n\n4.225.\n\nFrom the evidence before the Tribunal, this seems to have been a significant turningpoint for Mr Donziger. Contrary to his inclination, he was doing something that was manifestly wrong by any standard for the administration of justice; and he knew it *.* Wrong as this was, much worse was to follow.\n\n***2006***\n----------\n\n4.226.\n\n*2006* : By 2006, Mr Donziger had by now assumed the leading role amongst the representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, working closely with Mr Fajardo in Ecuador.\n\n4.227.\n\n*27 January 2006* : 35 of the 123 judicial inspections have been completed. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs apply to withdraw from the 26 pending inspections at Sacha Central and Shushufindi on the basis that these are no longer necessary since \"the environmental and social reality, as well as that of chemical or toxic components reported, is virtually the same; there are no major differences between one site and any other. From this, it can be concluded that the defendant Chevron (formerly Texaco) used the same operating practices at all of the sites in these Sacha and Shushufindi fields, and possibly in the entire concession area\u2026\". The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs further argue that the \"Global Assessment\", namely the audit of the entire Concession Area requested by them and ordered by Judge Guerra in his Order of 29 October 2003, would provide a detailed and complete study of each site affected by Texaco.174\n\nC-188, p. 2.\n\n4.228.\n\n*1 February 2006:* A settling expert report is made on the judicial inspection of a former concession site that TexPet had remediated under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, Sacha 53.175 The settling experts who reviewed the parties' experts' reports on Sacha 53 conclude that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had failed to substantiate their claims of environmental contamination. They found that TexPet's remediation was adequately performed and met Ecuadorian standards. They could not attribute to TexPet unremediated oil contamination near Sacha 53, which could have been caused by PetroEcuador after it assumed operations as \"Operator\" in 1990. This was the only site report made by the settling experts.\n\nConnor ER2, Exhibit 48, at paras 4, 6.\n\n4.229.\n\nDr Ramiro Fernando Reyes Cisneros was a petroleum and environmental engineer retained by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. In February and March 2006, Dr Reyes attends several meetings with representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, including Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo and Mr Yanza. Later, in 2012, Dr Reyes testifies in the US Section 1782 Litigation:\n\n*\"In these meetings Mr Donziger was very upset by the findings of the settling experts' report [on Sacha 53], and he complained that the report supported Chevron's position and did not support the plaintiffs' position \u2026 During our discussions, Mr Donzinger told us that our report should establish that the findings of the settling experts' report on Sacha 53 were wrong, that they lacked objectivity and were biased toward Chevron, and therefore the report should be discounted. However, in my professional opinion the evidence did not support Mr Donziger's position and I could not twist my professional assessments to make them fit the plaintiffs' interests \u2026 Mr Donziger expressed disappointment with our report and never asked us to submit it to the Court.\"176*\n\nC-1632, paras 19-20.\n\n4.230.\n\n*14 February 2006* : By letter dated 14 February 2006, Mr David Russell instructs Mr Donziger that he should not use his name as an expert supporting the quantum of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' case; namely US$ 6.14 billion for clean-up costs (see above). His letter states:\n\n*\"To date I have seen no data which would indicate that there is any significant surface or groundwater contamination caused by petroleum sources in Ecuador. Moreover, there was not, and is not any effort being made by the Plaintiffs in Aguinda vs Texaco to characterize the groundwater or the surface waters. As I recall there was substantial opposition by Cristobal [Bonifaz] toward doing any work in this area because of the costs of the Investigation. As the surface and groundwater cleanup represent a very large portion of the cost estimate, (over half), this further invalidates the 2003 cost estimate. As such, it would cause me to state that the 2003 cost estimate is too high by a substantial margin, perhaps by a factor of ten, or more.\"*\n\n4.231.\n\nIn his later affidavit sworn on 8 May 2013, Mr David Russell testified: \"As the lead environmental scientist for the plaintiffs in their case against Chevron in Ecuador [from late 2003 to early 2005], I spent several months investigating the environment at the oil production sites in the Oriente. I found that the environmental evidence did not and does not support the plaintiffs' claims. I saw no evidence of any widespread health effects caused by oil contamination from Texaco, and no evidence of drinking water contaminated with petroleum from Texaco's operations \u2026 there was no evidence linking residents' health problems to Texaco operations. The idea that the cleanup of the oil pits in the area would require billions of dollars is nonsense.\"177\n\nC-1631, paras 3, 31.\n\n4.232.\n\n*March 2006ff* : During his period in office for the Lago Agrio Litigation (see above), Judge Y\u00e1nez holds private meetings with Messrs Donziger and Fajardo nine times or\n\nmore during 2006 and 2007, at his house, a warehouse and elsewhere, to discuss the withdrawal of judicial inspections and the appointment of a sole global expert. In March 2006, Mr Donziger notes in his diary that: \"\u2026 due to some good strategising and some counter-pressure, the court is now in play, up for grabs, and accessible.\"178 These meetings were not disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.\n\nC-716, p. 73 of 111 (11 March 2006).\n\n4.233.\n\n*4 March 2006:* Mr Fajardo reports to his legal colleagues by email dated 4 March 2006 that Judge Y\u00e1nez had told him that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' request to withdraw [i.e. terminate] the judicial inspections had \"no legal basis.\"179\n\nC-1081.\n\n4.234.\n\n*8 March 2006* : At a judicial inspection of the Sacha Sur Station, Mr Donziger and a group of protesters are excluded from the site by police. Mr Donziger insists that the people had a right to enter and demanded that Judge Y\u00e1nez come to the gate to \"enforce the law\". Mr Donziger warns that: \"they're provoking a violent incident.\"180\n\nC-360, 8 March 2006, at CRS-028-01, pp. 10-11 [00:32-00:45].\n\n4.235.\n\n*11 March 2006:* Mr Donziger describes a private meeting with Judge Y\u00e1nez on the day before the San Carlos judicial inspection.181 He notes in his diary:\n\n*\"These judges are really not very bright \u2013 it is like a vocational job to them, they deal with resolving disputes at a very basic level, there is little or no intellectual component to the law\u2026 The concepts of tort law and joint and several liability are acceptable in Ecuador, but nobody uses them, so judges have no exposure to them. That part of the case is a real uphill battle. But I keep thinking of what Mateo182**told me - the only way we will win this case is if the judge thinks he will be doused with gasoline and burned if he rules against us. Given the morality or immorality of Ecuador's justice system, that type of comment did not even shock me. It is part of the rules of the game here.\"*\n\nC-716, p. 73 of 111 (11 March 2006).\n\nMr Donziger identified \"Mateo\" as an associate in Mr Ponce's law firm in Ecuador (representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs): C-952, p. 1287.\n\n4.236.\n\nIn his later US deposition, Mr Donziger testifies: \"I remember being shocked by Mateo's statement. I never thought that he meant it literally. But I did think that he meant it in the sense that there was a general feeling among the people we worked with that Chevron had bought the court and bought the judges based on their long history of the way they operated in Ecuador.183 And we needed to be aware of that to combat that kind of institutional corruption.\"184 When pressed on this inconsistency, Mr Donziger testified: \"People can change their opinions, sir. I remember specifically when he told me that being shocked. When I reflected on it and understood how I felt the Ecuadorian legal system had been abused by Texaco and Chevron over a period of decades, I think I changed my opinion when I wrote that.\"185\n\nAs already noted, Chevron had never operated in Ecuador: Mr Donziger is here referring to TexPet.\n\nC-952, pp. 1288-1289.\n\nC-952, pp. 1290-1291.\n\n4.237.\n\n*11 March 2006:* In this diary entry, Mr Donziger also describes another private meeting with Judge Y\u00e1nez: \"\u2013 had lunch with him the previous Friday in the Cangrejo Rojo I love it \u2013 this lobbying. I am good at it. But I hate it, hate that it is necessary, hate that it is part of the legal culture\u2026 I think it runs counter to any good person\u2026 I gave the judge a one-page memo on the law, and showed him the graphs from SA-53, the site where the peritos had derimido supposedly. We talked about the theory, about the need to let the people in San Carlos speak, about the need not to cancel the inspection, to not have another Guanta.\"186 This conversation and documentation was not disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.\n\nC-716, p. 73 of 111 (11 March 2006); C-952, pp. 1287-1288.\n\n4.238.\n\n*11 March 2006:* Mr Donziger's diary records that \"Bonifax fired\".187 This was a reference to Mr Crist\u00f3bal Bonifaz, being dismissed as a legal representative of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.\n\nC-716, p. 74 of 111 (11 March 2006).\n\n4.239.\n\n*30 March 2006:* Chevron had filed a motion before the Ecuadorian judge in Quito on 24 March 2006, seeking an order for the judicial inspection of the HAVOC laboratory. This laboratory was analysing the soil and water samples which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had obtained from TexPet's sites in the former concession area. Mr Donziger asserts, privately on camera: \"They're trying to harass the lab out of business, and extract information that they can use, you know, as part of their publicity campaign to damage the lab and get rid of its clients\u2026\"188 On this day, Mr Donziger explains privately on camera: \"\u2026we're going down and we're gonna confront the judge, who we believe is paid by Texaco; we believe he is corrupt, and we're gonna confront him, uh\u2026with \u2013 with our \u2026suspicions about his corruption, and let him know what time it is.\"189 Mr Donziger states, again privately on camera, \"This is something that you would never do in the United States. I mean, this is something you would \u2013 I mean, this is just out of bounds, both in terms of judicial behaviour, and what \u2013 what lawyers would do. But Ecuador, you know, there's almost no rules here. And this is how the game is played, it's dirty.\"190 Mr Donziger continues, privately on camera: \"So we are going down to have a little chat with the judge today, we'll see what happens\".191\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00-CLIP 01, p. 35 [3:55-4:05].\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00-CLIP 01, p. 35 [4:12-4:25].\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00-CLIP 01, p. 35 [4:29-4:40].\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00-CLIP 01, p. 39 [6:16-6:30].\n\n4.240.\n\n*30 March 2006:* Mr Donziger further explains, privately on camera: \"\u2026 this is part \u2013 this is one more battle, it's been going on now for several weeks: we've already met with the judge [in Quito] once, we're meeting with him again. And the only language that I believe this judge is gonna understand is one of pressure, intimidation and humiliation. And that's what we're doing today. \u2026 We're going to scare the judge, I think today. We're gonna let him know what time it is. I hate doing it. I hate doing this stuff. I don't feel comfortable doin' it. As a lawyer I never do this. You don't have to do it in the United States. It's, it's dirty. I hate it. Hate it, but it's necessary. I'm not lettin' 'em get away with this stuff.\"192\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00-CLIP-06, p. 39 [8:15-8:44].\n\n4.241.\n\nThere is no justification for Mr Donziger's improper conduct. There may, however, be one or more explanations. It is possible to infer, at least until this time, that Mr Donziger honestly believed that Chevron was misconducting itself in much the same way towards the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, and to greater effect. From all the evidence seen by the Tribunal, however, there was no reasonable basis for Mr Donziger's belief (if it existed) that Chevron was conducting itself improperly in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.242.\n\nThere is another possible explanation. It was Texaco that had ensured that the Aguinda Complaint be stayed in New York in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction. As Mr Donziger and his colleagues knew, that jurisdiction was not chosen by Texaco because it feared the Ecuadorian legal system or the Government of Ecuador (as then constituted).\n\n4.243.\n\nMr Wray, as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' senior legal representative (until 2005/2006), testified in the US 1782 Litigation, in 2010:193\n\n*\"\u2026 since the beginning of the case and it was clear that the respondents' strategies consisted of blaming PetroEcuador of the contamination, I believed it was necessary for PetroEcuador to appear in the case as a third party defending itself from the accusations made by Texaco. When the case started, it was not possible to have any relationship with the government with PetroEcuador, at least for myself. I was very critical and actually I opposed the government at that time so that in the beginning it was not possible to do it. Moreover, it was clear that just as soon as the case began, that at that time PetroEcuador's authorities were rather inclined towards favoring the respondents, and this became clear of some statements, and I don't remember if it was made by either the Minister of Energy or Ecuador's President. And because of the fact of the legal team defended Texaco at that time was getting the clear support of the government at the time, at least to the extent that they were able to or they allowed them to -- to reside within a military complex in Lago Agrio when all the judicial inspections began. So meanwhile the team of the petitioners, the claimants, us, had to -- had to stay at hotels in the area or rent an apartment for the case. The Chevron/Texaco team was staying within a military government complex \u2026\".*\n\nR-198, pp. 77-78 (under Court Order dated 3 November 2010, R-253).\n\n4.244.\n\nFollowing Mr Correa's election as President of Ecuador in January 2007, Chevron's relations with the Respondent's Government were to undergo a significant change, for the worse.\n\n4.245.\n\nReturning to the events of 30 March 2006 regarding the HAVOC laboratory, Mr Donziger brings video cameras into the chambers of the judge hearing the parties' dispute in Quito. Mr Donziger there tells the judge that Texaco's lawyers were \"playing dirty\" and \"trying to corrupt the legal process\u2026\". Mr Donziger repeatedly accuses Dr Larrea, one of Chevron's lawyers, of being \"a corrupt attorney\".194 The judge suspends the hearing, which appears from the video to have become unruly resulting from Mr Donziger's aggressive conduct.195\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00, p. 51ss.\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-052-00, p. 51ss.\n\n4.246.\n\nMr Donziger later states, privately on camera, that: \"the judicial system here is so utterly weak \u2026 [T]he only way that you can secure a fair trial is if you do things like that \u2026 like go in and confront the judge with media around. And fight and yell and scream and make a scene.\"196 In Mr Donziger's own words, what he achieved \"would never happen in any judicial system that had integrity.\"197\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-053-02-CLIP 01 (also CRS-052-00-CLIP 06), p. 91 [00:08-00:21].\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-053-02-CLIP 01, p. 91 [00:24-00:27].\n\n4.247.\n\nIn his US deposition in the RICO Litigation, Mr Donziger is asked about this incident:\n\n*Q: Did you pressure the judge in Ecuador who had approved the inspection of HAVOC Lab to change his opinion? A: I wouldn't characterise it as pressure. We went in and felt like he had made a decision that had no legal basis and had been done ex parte and we wanted to be heard. So members of our legal team, including myself, went to his office in a scene that is depicted in the movie Crude, to try to persuade him to cancel his order.*\n\n*Q: And going into that meeting didn't you say that you understood the only language the judge would understand was pressure, intimidation and humiliation? A: I don't know. What I did, though, was entirely proper and was captured in the movie.198*\n\nC-943, pp.1834-1835.\n\n4.248.\n\n*30 March 2006:* Mr Donziger, privately on camera, further asserts that Texaco's lawyers had \"got to that judge first \u2026 I believe they have paid him, and paid the secretary, probably a hundred bucks \u2026 And they signed these illegal documents forcing an inspection of a lab, in an effort to destroy our case.\" Mr Donziger continues: \"if it turns out that if a thousand people need to come up from Quito and surround that lab to prevent this inspection from happening, we'll consider doing it. 'Cause this is hand-to-hand combat.\"199\n\nC-360, 30 March 2006, at CRS-053-02-CLIP 01, p. 91 [00:39-00:54, 01:00-01:10].\n\n4.249.\n\nLater, in his US deposition in the RICO Litigation, Mr Donziger was asked whether he had any evidence that the Quito judge had received monies from Chevron in return for ordering the inspection of the HAVOC laboratory. Mr Donziger testified:\n\n*\"\u2026 A: We believed the judge was corrupt, but we didn't have evidence he had actually been paid.*\n\n*Q: Did you have any factual basis for believing the judge was corrupt? A: Yes.*\n\n*Q: What was your factual basis? A: His decision was illegal, inappropriate, bizarre, irregular, and fit into Chevron's \u2013 what we believe was Chevron's corrupt scheme to intimidate the court. And the whole thing we believed was corrupt. So therefore, since he did it, we believed he was corrupt\".200*\n\n(This Tribunal has been shown no evidence that the Quito judge was corrupted by Chevron, as alleged by Mr Donziger or otherwise).\n\nC-943, pp. 1840-1841.\n\n4.250.\n\n*30 March 2006* : Mr Donziger states, privately on camera: \"We have concluded that we need to do more, politically, to control the court, to pressure the court.

Mr Donziger replies, \"[h]e might not be, but \u2026 he thinks he will be. Which is just as good.\" Mr Donziger further states, \"[The judges] don't have to be intelligent enough to understand the law, just as long as they understand the politics.\"202\n\nC-360, 5 April 2006, at CRS-129-00-CLIP 02, pp. 144-145 [00:40-01:47].\n\n4.252.\n\n*30 May 2006:* A meeting is held between Messrs Donziger, Fajardo and others representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to decide whether to petition the Lago Agrio Court for a global expert. Mr Donziger notes: \"Pablo [Fajardo] and our legal team keep insisting that the solution is for the judge (then Judge Y\u00e1nez) to appoint someone who is favorable to us \u2026 I don't trust this approach, given our experience so far.\"203\n\nC-716, p. 63 of 111 (31 May 2006).\n\n4.253.\n\n*2 June 2006:* Mr Donziger notes in his diary: \"I told them we need a massive protest on the court, and only after that should we talk to the judge [Judge Y\u00e1nez] about what he needs to do.

The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs apply to the Lago Agrio Court, to waive their right to carry out \"at this stage of the lawsuit\" the judicial inspections requested by them at Sacha, Aguarico, Guanta, Auca, Cononaco, Lago Agrio, Yuca and Parahuaco Fields.208\n\nC-505.\n\n4.258.\n\n*25 July 2006:* Mr Donziger notes in his diary: \"Our issues first and foremost are whether the judge [Judge Y\u00e1nez] will accept the renuncia of the inspections. \u2026 If it doesn't happen, then we are in all-out war with the judge to get him removed.\"209\n\nC-716, p. 56 of 109; pp. 57-58 of 111 (25 July 2006).\n\n4.259.\n\n*25 July 2006:* In his diary, on the same day, Mr Donziger notes:210 \"\u2026 At which pt I launched into my familiar lecture about how the only way the court will respect us is if they fear us \u2013 and that the only way they will fear us is if they think we have come control over their careers, their jobs, their reputations \u2013 that is to say, their ability to earn a livelihood.\"\n\nC-716, p. 57 of 111, p. 55 of 109 (25 July 2006).\n\n4.260.\n\n*26 July 2006:* Mr Donziger writes in his email message to Mr Kohn (of Kohn, Swift & Graf) in the USA, entitled \"Potentially Huge\": \"Pablo [Fajardo] met with the judge today [Judge Y\u00e1nez]. The judge, who is on his heels from the charges of trading jobs for sex in the court, said he is going to accept our request to withdraw the rest of the inspections. \u2026 The judge also I believe wants to forestall the filing of a complaint against him by us, which we have prepared but not yet filed.\"211\n\nC-760, p. 1.\n\n4.261.\n\nThis was a private meeting between Judge Y\u00e1nez and Mr Fajardo not known by or disclosed to Chevron at the time. Judge Y\u00e1nez' decision to accede to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' applications was the direct result of the blackmail committed by Mr Fajardo, with the knowledge and support of Messrs Donziger and others representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.\n\n4.262.\n\n*22 August 2006:* By court order, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Y\u00e1nez) terminates the remaining 64 judicial inspections, in response to the application made by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and opposed by Chevron.212\n\nC-195.\n\n4.263.\n\n*13 September 2006:* Mr Donziger notes in his diary: \"Legal case: going well with [Judge] Y\u00e1nez decision to cancel inspections \u2026 We wrote up a complaint against Y\u00e1nez, but never filed it, while letting him know we might file it if he does not adhere to the law and what we need \u2026\".213\n\nC-716, pp. 56 of 111, 54 of 109 (13 September 2006).\n\n4.264.\n\n*11 October 2006:* In a private meeting (not known by or disclosed to Chevron at the time), Judge Y\u00e1nez tells Mr Fajardo that he would not permit Chevron to assert any further challenges to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' request for the waiver (i.e. termination) of judicial inspections. Mr Fajardo reports by email to Mr Donziger: \"The President [of the Court] was clear and said that he will not permit any further collateral issues about the waiver of our inspections.\"214\n\nC-1261, p. 1.\n\n4.265.\n\n*3 November 2006:* In an email message to Mr Neil Mitchell of Winston & Strawn (as lawyers acting for Ecuador in the USA), relating to Mr Reis Veiga's deposition in the USA, Mr Donziger writes: \"It would help us for you to keep RV [Mr Veiga] on the hot seat for as long as possible and press him in a number of areas that will make him uncomfortable\u2026 Remember, the info on the fraud issue is still useful for us in Lago and in the ongoing criminal investigation in Ecuador \u2013 thus, if you could put on the 'investigatory' hat in this regard that would be helpful. The way to justify it is that this all goes to his credibility\u2026\"215 As Mr Donziger knew, this \"fraud issue\" and \"criminal investigation\" impugned the legal validity of the 1995 Settlement Agreement signed by Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez, which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were seeking to negate in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\nC-794, pp. 1-2.\n\n4.266.\n\n*4 December 2006* : The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs request that the Lago Agrio Court \"immediately order the performance of the expert assessment for purposes of verifying the environmental effects of the activities associated with the production of hydrocarbons at all the fields operated by\" TexPet [i.e. the \"global assessment\"].216\n\nC-189, p. 1.\n\n4.267.\n\n*16 December 2006* : Mr Donziger notes in his diary, regarding the proposed appointment of Mr Cabrera as the Court's sole global assessment expert: \"I see using E-tech [E-Tech, a firm of environmental experts acting for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs] to give him cover, but he has to totally play ball with us and let us take the lead while projecting the image that he is working for the court.\"217\n\nC-716, p. 32 of 111; p. 30 of 109 (16 December 2006).\n\n***2007***\n----------\n\n4.268.\n\n*15 January 2007:* President Rafael Correa assumes office as the President of Ecuador, for the first time.\n\n4.269.\n\n*22 January 2007* : Having by order terminated the procedure for the judicial inspections,218 the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Y\u00e1nez) orders both sides to appear before him so that, if possible, they could mutually indicate the experts who would participate in the global expert assessment.219\n\nC-196.\n\nC-196.\n\n4.270.\n\n*19 January 2007* : Mr Donziger notes in his diary: \"Met with the judge [Judge Y\u00e1nez] last night in house. Humble house, furniture. Made tea. I really like the guy. Remember last August I wanted to ride the wave and get him off the case? This was an example of Pablo's [Pablo Fajardo] total intelligence. We saved him, and now we are reaping the benefits.\"220 Mr Donziger also notes, in the same diary entry: \"Guerra will be the judge to decide the case. We have to start lobbying him, working with him.\" None of this was disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.\n\nC-716, p. 27 of 111; p. 26 of 109 (19 January 2007).\n\n4.271.\n\n*31 January 2007:* During a meeting between Mr Donziger and Mr Kohn privately recorded on film, regarding the Respondent's criminal prosecution of the two Chevron attorneys, Mr Reis and Dr P\u00e9rez, Mr Donziger reports that Chevron is alleging a conspiracy between the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and the Government of Ecuador \u2013 to which Mr Kohn replies: \"if only they knew\".221\n\nC-360, 31 January 2007, at CRS-169-05-CLIP 09, p. 252 [00:19].\n\n4.272.\n\n*3 March 2007:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, including Messrs Donziger and Fajardo, and their experts meet (privately) Mr Cabrera, as the Court's sole global assessment expert in the Lago Agrio Litigation soon to be formally appointed by the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Y\u00e1nez).\n\n4.273.\n\nAt this meeting, recorded privately on film, Mr Fajardo identifies six steps that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs should take, specifically: (1) \"[k]eep up the pressure and constant oversight in the court\"; (2) \"[m]ake certain that the expert [i.e. Mr Cabrera] constantly coordinates with the plaintiffs' technical and legal team\"; (3) \"[t]he plaintiffs' technical coordinator must be [involved] in the process fulltime\" and \"[a]ccompany the expert in the field\"; (4) \"an attorney \u2026 will always be in the field to also protect the activity being performed\"; (5) \"provide the facilities and necessary support to the field team\"; and (6) \"support the expert in writing the report.\"\n\n4.274.\n\nMr Fajardo emphasises that the entire Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' team must contribute to the Cabrera report, explaining: \"And here is where we do want the support of our entire technical team \u2026 of experts, scientists, attorneys, political scientists, so that all will contribute to that report\u2014in other words\u2014you see \u2026 the work isn't going to be the expert's. All of us bear the burden.\"\n\n4.275.\n\nOne of the meeting's participants then asks whether the final report would be prepared by the expert (i.e. Mr Cabrera). Mr Fajardo states that the expert will \"sign the report and review it. But all of us \u2026 have to contribute to that report.\" Dr Anne Maest (of Stratus Consulting) asks, \"together?\", which Mr Fajardo confirms. Dr Maest then says, \"But not Chevron,\" to which everyone laughs.222 Towards the end of the meeting, Mr Donziger states: \"We could jack this thing up to thirty billion dollars in one day.\"223\n\nC-360, 3 March 2007, at CRS-191-00-CLIP 03, pp. 312-314 [03:08-04:36].\n\nC-360, 3 March 2007, at CRS-193-00-CLIP-01, pp. 321-322 [3:37-3:38].\n\n4.276.\n\nThe same meeting is described by Mr Donziger in his diary, as follows:\n\n*\"\u2026 Technical meeting on Sat in office: Richard [Cabrera] there. Sat had all-day Tech meeting in the office - unusual for a 'dia laboral' as Pablo [Fajardo] put it. Richard and Fernando [Reyes] there, as was Ann [Maest], Dick [Kamp], and Champ [Charlie Kamp]. Pablo delivered first; excellent, then Olga Lucia, the best I have seen her; then Champ. Great spirit and energy in the room. It made me realize how much we have accomplished. \u2026 I spend the whole day making comments and mostly directing them to Richard. We laid out our entire case and legal theory - what a benefit! We need to do the same with the judge \u2026\".224*\n\nC-716, p. 8 of 111; p. 6 of 109 (7 March 2007).\n\n4.277.\n\nNo-one present at this meeting could have misunderstood the plan, namely to have Mr Cabrera formally appointed as the sole expert to the Lago Agrio Court, for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and advisers (but not Mr Cabrera) covertly to write the Cabrera Report and to disguise that report, dishonestly, as the work of Mr Cabrera. Astonishingly, all this was willingly recorded on film by the meeting's participants, including Mr Cabrera, Mr Fajardo and Mr Donziger. Needless to say, none of this was disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.\n\n4.278.\n\n*4 March 2007:* Mr Donziger and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' US experts meet to discuss their private meeting held with Mr Cabrera on the previous day. The experts include Dr Maest, Dr Kamp and Mr Champ. The meeting appears to have taken place in a restaurant (as privately recorded on film). These experts advise Mr Donziger that no evidence of groundwater contamination exists. Dr Maest states: \"And right now all the reports are saying it's just at the pits and the stations and nothing has spread anywhere at all\".225 Mr Donziger replies: \"Hold on a second, you know, this is Ecuador, okay? \u2026 You can say whatever you want and at the end of the day, there's a thousand people around the courthouse, you're going to get what you want \u2026 And we can get money for it \u2026 Because at the end of the day, this is all for the Court just a bunch of smoke and mirrors and bullshit. It really is. We have enough, to get money, to win.\"226\n\n\"It\" denotes groundwater contamination.

He testified: \"I think I made that statement for dramatic effect\".227 The Tribunal does not understand this explanation.\n\nC-715, pp. 798-799.\n\n4.280.\n\nThe participants in the meeting later discuss whether it would be helpful to test a specific site and the particular manner of doing it, also as privately recorded on film. Mr Champ states \"I know we have to be totally transparent with Chevron in showing them what we are doing\", to which Mr Donziger replies \"Well, no, no, no, because they will find out everything we do\". Dr Maest then suggests \"Yeah, we don't have to give them our plan. I don't think, do we? Mr Donziger replies \"Well, it's a little unclear. Nobody's ever done this before. This is so crazy. Our goal is that they don't know shit - and that's why they're so panicked - there's no way they can control this, because they didn't ask for it.\"228\n\nC-360, 4 March 2007, at CRS-196-00-CLIP 01, pp. 334-335 [00:17-00:41].\n\n4.281.\n\n*4 March 2007:* During a discussion with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' experts (except Mr Champ) following the above meeting, Mr Donziger explains as privately recorded on film, \"If we have a legitimate fifty billion dollar damage claim, and they end up - judge says, well, I can't give them less than five billion. \u2026 And, say, [Chevron] had a huge victory; they knocked out ninety per cent of the damage claim.\"229\n\nC-360, 4 March 2007, at CRS-196-01-CLIP 01, pp. 342-343 [00:39-00:51].\n\n4.282.\n\n*6 March 2007:* During a meeting with Stratus Consulting and others (including Dr Maest), Mr Donziger states, as privately recorded on film: \"Now, I once worked for a lawyer who said something I've never forgotten. He said, 'Facts do not exist. Facts are created.'\" Everyone laughs. Mr Donziger continues, \"[a]nd ever since that day, I realized how the law works.\"230\n\nC-360, 6 March 2007, at CRS-195-05-CLIP 01, pp. 327-329 [21:28-21:39].\n\n4.283.\n\n*19 March 2007* : The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Y\u00e1nez) formally appoints Mr Cabrera as the sole expert for conducting the global expert assessment upon the request of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, opposed by Chevron.231\n\nC-197.\n\n4.284.\n\n*20 March 2007* : A meeting takes place between President Correa with members of the Ecuadorian Government, including the Environment Minister, Ms Anita Alb\u00e1n, Mr Xavier Garaicoa Ortiz (of the Procuradur\u00eda General); Mr Alexis Mera (the President's legal adviser), PetroEcuador and representatives of the ADF and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, Mr Yanza, Mr Ponce, Ms Yepez and Ms Lupita Heredia.232\n\nTrack II Hearing, Claimants' Opening Oral Submission, Slide 5.\n\n4.285.\n\nAs subsequently reported by Ms Yepez in her email to Mr Donziger dated 21 March 2007:233\n\n*\"\u2026 The Prez [President Correa] was very upset at Texaco. He asked the Attorney General to do everything necessary to win the trial and the arbitration in the U.S. He asked his team to urgently work on the matter. This Saturday he will report on the matter on national television. Officially now at that time he will clarify several points in order not to hurt us in the trial. He ordered that a cabinet be formed in the Amazon, inviting or bringing the press so they can visit the places affected by Texaco with his team. He also said that he would like to figure out a legal and judicial way to try Texaco for genocide. He gave us fabulous support. He even said that he would call the judge. I don't know if this could also hurt us, but the attorneys and Luis [Yanza] have to pay closer attention to delicate matters.\"*\n\nC-1005.\n\n4.286.\n\nThe Tribunal has seen no evidence that the Respondent's President (or any officer on his behalf) called any judge at the Lago Agrio Court, then or later.\n\n4.287.\n\n*26 March 2007:* In his email messages to Mr Donziger dated 26 March 2007, Mr Fajardo refers to Judge Y\u00e1nez as the \"cook,\" the Lago Agrio Court's global assessment expert, Mr Cabrera, as the \"waiter\", the \"menu\" as the work plan, the \"other restaurant\" as Chevron, and the \"messenger\" as Mr Fajardo:\"234\n\n*\"Today the cook met with the waiter to coordinate the menu. What is new is that in view of the other restaurant's challenge, the cook has the idea of putting in another waiter, to be on the other side. This is troublesome. I suggest we activate alarms, contacts, strategies, pressures in order to avoid this happening. It is necessary to do it urgently.\"*\n\n*\"The Lago Agrio messenger is waiting to meet this afternoon with the cook, to listen to his position. I suggest that the heads of Quito, Lago Agrio and NY talk at six thirty, Ecuador time. By this time the messenger will already have some news regarding what the cook is saying.\"*\n\nC-917.\n\n4.288.\n\nMr Donziger later confirmed in his testimony at the RICO trial that the \"cook\" referred to Judge Y\u00e1nez, the \"waiter\" referred to Mr Cabrera, and the \"other restaurant\" referred to Chevron.235 He also confirmed that the appointment of a second global assessment expert, as intimated by Judge Y\u00e1nez, was (in the words of his email to Mr Fajardo) \"unacceptable\". No such second expert is appointed by the Lago Agrio Court. None of this was disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.\n\nC-2382, pp. 2548-2550.\n\n4.289.\n\n*29 March 2007:* In advising the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs during a private meeting, President Correa's legal adviser, Mr Alexis Mera, recommends that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs pressure the Prosecutor-General to \"reopen\" the investigation: \"you have to take the people from the Orient[e] there [the Public Prosecutor's Office], hold a demonstration \u2026 [T]hat's how this country works.\" In response, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives tell Mr Mera that \"although we could mobilize people, the \u2013 the official nature of the President could do much more in this case \u2026 an interest by the Executive Branch - and pressure on the Public Prosecutor's Office \u2026 could do a lot on this subject.\" When the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives continue to press that the Executive Branch's involvement would have a \"political impact\" on the case, Mr Mera agrees, saying: \"I do understand the whole political thing.\"236\n\nC-360, 29 March 2007, CRS-221-02-CLIP 01, pp. 419, 422, 432 [00:28-00:33; 04:00-04:10; 13:25-13:28].\n\n4.290.\n\n*27 April 2007* : President Correa visits the former concession area in the Oriente, with Mr Fajardo and Mr Yanza. (Mr Donziger is not present). Shortly thereafter, the President calls for the criminal prosecution of the Ecuadorian Government's officials who signed the 1995 Settlement Agreement and also of TexPet's representatives, i.e. Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez (see the Criminal Prosecutions above).\n\n4.291.\n\n*6 June 2007:* During a meeting of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' advisers, recorded privately on film, Mr Donziger proposes to \"take over the [Lago Agrio] court with a massive protest,\" in order to \"shut the court down for a day.\" He states that there was an \"institutional weakness in the judiciary,\" and that \"they [the judges] make decisions based on who they fear [the] most.\"237 Mr Donziger also describes, privately on film, the \"need to make facts \u2026 that help us\" even though \"the facts that we need don't always exist.\"238\n\nC-360, 6 June 2007, at CRS-350-04-CLIP 01 at 566-567 [00:32-01:40]; Track II Hearing, Claimants' Opening Oral Submission, Slide 11.\n\nC-360, 6 June 2007, at CRS-375-00-CLIP 05, p. 600.\n\n4.292.\n\n*7 June 2007:* Mr Fajardo states, privately on film, that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs need to increase pressure on the Lago Agrio Court to swear in Mr Cabrera: \"the judge [i.e. now Judge Y\u00e1nez] is scared shitless.\"239\n\nC-360, 7 June 2007, at CRS-376-03-CLIP 10, p. 613 [00:14-00:17].\n\n4.293.\n\n*13 June 20* 07: Less than one week later, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Y\u00e1nez) swears in Mr Cabrera as the Court's sole \"global assessment expert\". At this ceremony, Mr Cabrera takes an oath \"to perform his duties faithfully\" and \"with complete impartiality and independence\" from the disputing parties.240 Mr Cabrera was thereby to act as a court expert, appointed by the Lago Agrio Court to act as a neutral expert to the Court. This was not to be.\n\nC-363, p. 4.\n\n4.294.\n\n*13 June 2007* : Mr Donziger states privately on film that Judge Y\u00e1nez \"never would have [appointed Mr Cabrera] had we not really pushed him.\" He then states: \"It's just like \u2013 you know? \u2026 All of this bullshit about the law and the facts \u2013 and it factors into it because it affects the level of force\u2026 At the end of the day, it is about brute force, who could apply the pressure and who could withstand the pressure and can you get them to the breaking point \u2026\".241\n\nC-360, 13 June 2007 at CRS-361-11, CLIP 01, pp. 592-593 [00:24-00:44].\n\n4.295.\n\nWhen asked about this statement in his US deposition, Mr Donziger testified that he made it for \"dramatic effect\".242 Again, the Tribunal does not understand this explanation. Nonetheless, the Tribunal infers that Mr Donziger's reference to \"brute force\" and \"breaking point\" includes the improper treatment to which Judge Y\u00e1nez was deliberately subjected by Mr Donziger and his colleagues, without which Judge Y\u00e1nez would not have appointed Mr Cabrera as the Court's sole Global Assessment expert.\n\nC-715, pp. 801-804.\n\n4.296.\n\n*4 July 2007* : Mr Cabrera ostensibly begins work as the designated sole global assessment expert to the Lago Agrio Court, with his technical team.\n\n4.297.\n\n*17 July 2007* : Mr Donziger sends an email message to Mr Fajardo: \"Ideas para reunion con Richard [Cabrera]\".243 It reads:\n\n*\"Commanders of the Urban and North Front:*\n\n*These are the fastest ideas:*\n\n*1) That we think that Richard should suspend his work in the field and we should not pay the team until after the recess. We just need him to tell the team and Texaco that he's going to start all over after the recess so there is nothing strange, everything appears normal.*\n\n*2) When I get there, we'll re analyze the work and the budget with Richard. And we'll adjust with a much smaller team. My tendency is to stop Richard from working much more in the field\u2026 or, if he continues doing it, he should continue under the most strict control with an extremely limited number of samples. And we'll change the focus of the data at our offices.*\n\n*3) It is key to have deadlines to receive drafts from all the consultants, such as the biologists, the water man, and so on. Personally, I don't want to wait for the 'final' product to determine if the work is useful or not, or we will be screwed because they will ask for even more money to make the changes if we are not properly informed of everything during the process.*\n\n*4) The main problem with Richard is the lack of money and the distraction of the most important proof of the case, that is, the 80,000 chemical results that we already have. The most important thing of the field is the subterranean water and I think that we don't even have that planned, and now I'm worried because we don't have the money to do it.*\n\n*I think that, without realizing it, we are being quite similar to the style of Wray/Pareja/Russell, that is, we are trying to do too much, producing waste and delaying for lack of budget, and, without realizing it, we are helping the enemy's strategy of delaying the trial.*\n\n*I'll talk to you later on the phone. It is all about money, I know, but it is also about strategy.*\n\n*Thank you, my bosses.\"*\n\nC-2319.\n\n4.298.\n\n*23 July 2007:* Mr Cabrera's letter to the Lago Agrio Court denies that he has \"any relation or agreements with the plaintiff;\" and he states that \"it seems to me to be an insult against me that I should be linked with the attorneys of the plaintiffs.\"244\n\nC-366.\n\n4.299.\n\n*3 September 2007* : Chevron again seeks inspections of the HAVOC Lab, which had been ordered by the Quito Court. Mr Donziger explains in an email message to Mr Fajardo and others: \"An inspection of [the HAVOC Lab] would be a disaster for the Lago Agrio case. \u2026 I say that we \u2026 accuse all of them, including the judge [i.e. the Judge in Quito], of corruption for still even thinking of ordering an illegal inspection with no basis in the law in order to favour a corrupt transnational that is killing innocent Ecuadorians.\"245 (It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal exactly why such an inspection would have been a \"disaster\" for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' case).\n\nC-1033.\n\n4.300.\n\nBy now, the Lago Plaintiffs' representatives maintain a \"secret\" bank account at the Banco Pichincha for the purpose of making covert payments to Mr Cabrera.246 This was one of the accounts used by Selva Viva, an Ecuadorian legal entity controlled by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives for the purpose of the Lago Agrio Litigation. Mr Donziger is the president of Selva Viva. One of its employees involved in banking transactions, is Ms Ximera Centeno. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' internal documents identify her as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' librarian, receptionist and payment administrator.247 (As described below, Ms Centeno also made monetary deposits to Mr Guerra on behalf the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives).\n\nC-1661, p. 37.\n\nTorres ER, p. 24; Exhibit 49.\n\n4.301.\n\n*12 September 2007* : The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives are now paying more than US$ 100,000 to Mr Cabrera through the \"secret\" bank account, including a single payment of US$ 30,000.248 As Mr Yanza states in an email message of 12 September 2007 to Mr Donziger:\n\n*\"\u2026 I think we should plan ahead and not give those Texaco bastards the pleasure, using the same mechanism from weeks ago, that is, he [Mr Kohn] sends us money to our secret account, to give to Wuao [Mr Cabrera], [to] not stop the work. I estimate it will be about 30,000, but since there are expenses from the last work day in the south, it might be another 20,000. In any case, this money will then be reimbursed to SV [Selva Viva] once the judge orders us to pay. To conclude, please explain this situation to JK [Mr Kohn] so he can transfer 30 [US$ 30,000] to our Secret Account and 20 to SV, but he could send the 50 to the secret account and then we could pass the 20 to SV to save time and paperwork.

Mr Donziger confirmed that \"Wuao\" was one of the names that was used by him and others for Mr Cabrera: C-2382, p. 2550.\n\n4.303.\n\nOn the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the Tribunal finds that these payments to Mr Cabrera were made corruptly as bribes by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, including Mr Fajardo, Mr Yanza and Mr Donziger.\n\n4.304.\n\n*3 October 2007:* The Lago Agrio Court (now Judge Novillo) orders Mr Cabrera to be \"responsible for the entire report, the methodology used, for the work done by his assistants, etc.\" The Court also orders Mr Cabrera to \"observe and ensure \u2026 the impartiality of his work, and the transparency of his activities as a professional appointed by \u2026 the court\". The Court states that the role of the expert was one of complete impartiality and transparency with respect to the parties and their attorneys. The Court also states that Mr Cabrera \"\u2026 is an auxiliary to the Court for purposes of providing to the process and to the Court scientific elements for determining the truth.\"251\n\nC-364, p. 2.\n\n4.305.\n\nIn his capacity as the sole global assessment expert, Mr Cabrera was at all material times an auxiliary associate of the Lago Agrio Court and, thus, an officer of the Respondent's judicial branch. He was not permitted under Ecuadorian law to be the representative of or adviser to any disputing party to the Lago Agrio Litigation *.*\n\n4.306.\n\n*11 October 2007* : Further questions arise from Chevron as to the independence of Mr Cabrera from the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. On 11 October 2007, Mr Cabrera files a formal signed statement addressed to the Lago Agrio Court.252 It reads (inter alia) as follows:\n\n*\"(1) It is public knowledge that various questions have been raised with regard to my appointment, my work and the other technical officers that are working on the expert examination.*\n\n*(2) Your Honor, being the professional that I am and in compliance with the orders issued by you regarding my designation, confirmation and acceptance of my appointment as Expert, I have performed my work with absolute impartiality, honesty, transparency and professionalism.*\n\n*(3) I reject the descriptions or attacks that have been leveled against me alleging that I am biased toward one of the parties, and I also reject the unfounded accusations that I am performing my work surreptitiously. That is completely untrue. Both sides to this case have witnessed, on a daily basis, the sampling work performed, the sampling procedure employed, the number of samples collected, in addition to other activities.*\n\n*(4) I have complied with your orders and have provided sufficient advance notice to both litigating parties under the same conditions with regard to the sites where I planned to collect samples or perform the respective study.*\n\n*(5) Furthermore, both parties were initially signing the sample control sheet, but during the sampling process, first the defendant refused to sign that document, and then the plaintiff also refused to sign. I could not, in my capacity as an expert, obligate the parties to sign said document.*\n\n*(6) The task assigned to me includes evaluating the damage sustained by waters, soils, plant cover and fauna, among other activities. It is clear that I could not perform a job of this magnitude alone, and have therefore employed several technical officers and experts to perform these tasks under my coordination and responsibility. Once I submit my report to this court, Your Honor, the names of all of the technical officers that have collaborated in the study under my responsibility will be made public. Thus far, Your Honor, all I have done is attempt to plan and conduct the expert examination in the most complete, efficient and professional manner possible.\"*\n\nC-367, p. 2.\n\n4.307.\n\nIn particular, as to his alleged relationship with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, Mr Cabrera declares to the Lago Agrio Court:\n\n*\"The defendant's attorneys allege that the plaintiff [sic: plaintiffs] is in 'close contact' with me, and that the plaintiff has provided me with technical information and support staff to assist with the expert examination. This is untrue. If I need any technical information in connection with this case, all I have to do is request it from this Court; the idea that the plaintiffs would be helping me with that is unthinkable. With regard to personnel, I admit that initially, a person associated with the plaintiff did provide me with logistical support for the expert examination, but this has had no bearing on the core subjects of the expert examination, and therefore no influence or actual relationship exists. After the first days, I decided to rectify this situation and not allow any person associated with the parties to participate in my work in order to avoid absurd or ill-intentioned comments.*\n\n*Worse still is the accusation of the plaintiff's [sic: \"defendants\"] attorneys that the conduct of the other technical officers is a 'decoy', a ploy to conceal preexisting information provided by the plaintiff that I allegedly will simply attach to my expert report. I condemn this assertion because it has no basis and there is no evidence to support it, and I demand that these attorneys refrain from saying these kinds of things about me in the future.\"*\n\n4.308.\n\nThese statements of impartiality and independence from the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives were made falsely by Mr Cabrera.\n\n***2008***\n----------\n\n4.309.\n\n*2 January 2008:* In his email message dated 2 January 2008 (headed \"Necessary Tasks to be Completed in the Year 2008\" and \"Specific Tasks\") to Messrs Donziger, Saenz, Prieto, Yanza, Ponce and Alexandra Anchundia, Mr Fajardo includes: \"6. Coordinate with the President of the Republic for defense on the accusation of denial of justice.\"253\n\nC-805, p. 2.\n\n4.310.\n\n*13-19 January 2008:* Mr Beltman (in charge of Stratus Consulting's \"Ecuador Project\" for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs) and Dr Maest travel to Ecuador, at Mr Donziger's request, to meet Mr Cabrera privately, with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. This meeting is not disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time. In his later witness statement, Mr Beltman testifies that:\n\n*\"15. Based on that meeting with Cabrera and a review of his background, Cabrera lacked the skill, qualifications, and experience to conduct or review a multidisciplinary environmental damages assessment himself.*\n\n*16. At no time did I ever see any indication of an independent Cabrera \"team\" nor did I ever meet anyone I understood to be a member of Cabrera's \"independent team.\" To the contrary, individuals that I am aware of who assisted in preparing the Cabrera Report were affiliated with or working at the direction of Donziger and the LAPs' representatives.*\n\n*17. At no point during Stratus's time working on the Ecuador Project, including at the January 2008 meeting, did I have an understanding that Cabrera was preparing his own report. It was clear from statements Donziger and others made that the LAPs' team expected the Lago Agrio court to rely upon the Cabrera Report in rendering its judgment.\"254*\n\nC-1611A, paras 15-17.\n\n4.311.\n\n*22 February 2008:* In his email message to his colleagues at Stratus Consulting, Mr Beltman writes: \"The project is at a key point right now. We have to write, over the next 2 to 3 weeks, probably the single most important technical document for the case. The document will pull together all of the work over the last 15 or so years on the case and make recommendations for the court to consider in making its judgment \u2026\"255 This \"document\" was to be the \"Cabrera Report\".\n\nC-1758, p. 1.\n\n4.312.\n\n*26 February 2008* : Mr Beltman sends to his colleagues within Stratus Consulting an outline and chart showing how they should falsely \"attribute\" their work on the Cabrera Report to Mr Cabrera's \"team.\" The chart identifies who would be responsible for drafting each section, the reviewer/approver, and to whom it would be falsely attributed.256\n\nC-1078.\n\n4.313.\n\n*12 March 2008* : Stratus Consulting exchanges English language drafts of the \"Cabrera Report\" (Mr Cabrera does not speak English). Mr Beltman emails the English draft report for Spanish translation to \"info@translatingspanish.com,\" stating that \"[t]he main [Cabrera] report (the one attached to this email) is the highest priority.\" Mr Beltman notes that he would travel to Quito to review and make revisions to the report in Spanish.257\n\nC-855, p. 1; see also C-1611A, paras 22-27, 38-45 & 59-60.\n\n4.314.\n\n*31 March 2008* : The Respondent resumes the Criminal Prosecutions against (inter alios) Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez, as the signatories to the 1995 Settlement Agreement for TexPet.258\n\nSee R-250.\n\n4.315.\n\n*31 March 2008:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and advisers work on the so-called \"Cabrera Report\" until its filing in the Lago Agrio Court.\n\n4.316.\n\nAccording to Mr McGowan's expert testimony (of Stroz Friedberg, for Chevron in the US Litigation), the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives saved the latest version of the \"Cabrera Report\" on 31 March 2008 at 11:09 EST, and, \"[t]he text of [the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' report] \u2026 is identical to text of the report filed by Richard Stalin Cabrera Vega on April 1, 2008.\"259\n\nC-1048, paras 8, 24, 27.\n\n4.317.\n\n*1 April 2008:* Mr Cabrera formally files the Cabrera Report with the Lago Agrio Court. It advises the Court that Chevron should pay compensation in excess of US$ 16 billion.260 Mr Cabrera files an amended expert report in November 2008, with a revised figure for compensation of US$ 27.3 billion. (The Tribunal hereon refers to these two reports collectively, save where the contexts requires otherwise, as the \"Cabrera Report\").\n\nC-201.\n\n4.318.\n\nLater, in US legal proceedings, Mr Beltman and Mr Donziger both admitted that Stratus Consulting covertly wrote Mr Cabrera's Report.261 In this arbitration, the Respondent does not dispute that certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' experts wrote the Cabrera Report.262\n\nC-1611A, paras 12, 22-23, 27 & 44-46; C-902, p. 2253.\n\nR-TII CMem. Mer.

Cabrera already points out that the Texpet work did not actually clean up the pits, and the idea of this analysis was to determine if we could further criticize the Texpet cleanup for not complying with the technical requirements \u2026 Although there are some ambiguities of language and potential legal issues (such as apparent contradictions between the March 1995 Statement of Works and the RAP) I did not find any clear instances where Texpet did not meet the conditions required in the cleanup. The very large exception, of course, is that sampling during the judicial inspections and by Cabrera showed that the \"cleaned\" pits are still contaminated \u2013 however the sampling done by Woodward Clyde post-cleanup allowed the pits to be in compliance with the contract requirements. This important discrepancy has already been addressed by Cabrera in his report. There is also the issue that the RAP conflicts with Ecuadorian laws, but again I didn't evaluate that here. Therefore, I do not have any comments to prepare on this aspect of the Cabrera Report.\"*\n\nC-2043.\n\n4.320.\n\n*9 August 2008* : During his weekly presidential address, President Correa referred to the Government's support for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, as follows:\n\n*\" \u2026 Well, on Saturday the eighth, at 9:30, we had a working meeting on the Texaco case, so let's go to that, let's go to radio link number 81. Why did we have the working meeting on the Texaco case? You know that there's a lawsuit filed by the communities, the Amazon Defense Front, against Texaco Chevron, for all of the pollution that it left in the Amazon. So then, Texaco Chevron is asking to meet with the government. Well, I've told our comrades about that, to ask them what they thought, and we've agreed that we would meet with them, but with our comrades from the Amazon Defense Front present. We're not one of those right-wing sell-out governments that supported this multinational company and betrayed our people. But neither are we going to get involved in this, because it might be prejudicial to our comrades, because it's a case that's in the hands of the court, right? It's a court case. But previous governments supported Texaco Chevron and betrayed our people: they signed agreements saying that everything was resolved, which has been one of the principal arguments by Texaco Chevron in its defence, when in fact nothing was resolved. Now the Prosecutor General [Mr Washington Pes\u00e1ntez], has, very properly, opened an investigation to punish those people, because it was a lie: there was nothing, nothing resolved, nothing cleaned up, of all the pollution. So then, they probably want us to mediate the case, etc. If we can help, all the better, but if we meet with Texaco Chevron, we're also going to meet with our comrades from the Amazon Defense Front. That's what were going to say very clearly to our comrades from that group, who are extraordinary people. They're real heroes there, heroes that I would call anonymous heroes, don't you agree? One Luis Yanza, one Pablo Fajardo, who have fought for years for their people, for their Amazon, for the ecosystems, for nature, don't you agree? Congratulations, but watch out. There's not going to be any more of those sell-out governments. We're not going to get involved in the case, because it's a court case and we might hurt them. They've already made accusations that the State was pressuring the judges -haven't they? - to prejudice the case, but comrades \u2026 I mean that if we receive Chevron Texaco, it will be with you there. And if we can help in some way to mediate, etc., well, all the better, but based on justice, not based on power \u2026\".264*\n\nC-173.\n\n4.321.\n\n*9 August 2008* : In an exchange of email messages, Messrs Fajardo and Donziger state that they should be \"doing everything to prepare the court to issue a quick Judgment and in such a way that it can be enforced in the U.S. before appeals in Ecuador.\" They confirm that they soon will \"start the work with the new judges.\"265 The latter was a reference to the imminent end of Judge Novillo's term on 24 August 2008 as the Lago Agrio Judge presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation, when he was succeeded by Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez. The earlier reference to the enforcement of a \"quick judgment\" referred to the strategy described later in the Invictus Memorandum prepared by Patton Boggs in or about August 2010 (see below).\n\nC-993.\n\n4.322.\n\n*13 August 2008* : By email message dated 13 August 2008 to Mr Fajardo, Mr Donziger states: \"If you repeat a lie a thousand times it becomes the truth.\"266\n\nC-1630.\n\n4.323.\n\n*26 August 2008* : The Respondent's Prosecutor General Washington Pes\u00e1ntez Mu\u00f1oz brings criminal charges against (inter alios) Mr Reis and Dr P\u00e9rez, as TexPet's cosignatories to the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with related agreements), under Articles 338 and 339 of the Criminal Code.267\n\nC-252; Reis Veiga WS, para 52.\n\n***2009***\n----------\n\n4.324.\n\n*January 2009:* The film \"Crude\", directed by Mr Joseph Berlinger, is shown at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, USA. The film was principally funded by Mr Russell DeLeon, at the time a major non-party funder for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.325.\n\nThe film was subsequently released to the public. Chevron's legal advisers noted that one of these public releases was differently edited, suggesting that the unpublished outtakes might contain relevant material. In particular, that public version showed Dr Carlos Mart\u00edn Beristain (a member of Mr Cabrera's team) appearing to work privately with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. Mr Berlinger testified that he had removed from other versions of the film these scenes of Dr Beristain at the express request of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. (It is not clear why the other public version was not similarly edited; but it had significant consequences for the Lago Agrio Litigation).\n\n4.326.\n\nChevron brought legal proceedings in New York against Mr Berlinger and others to produce unpublished outtakes from the film \"Crude\" showing the representatives for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, private or court-appointed experts in that proceeding and current or former officials of the Government of Ecuador. On 15 July 2010, Chevron obtained copies of these outtakes, amounting to about 600 hours (compared to some 90 minutes of edited film), by court order made by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan) under Section 1782 affirmed (as modified) on appeal by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 15 July 2010.268\n\nC-359.\n\n4.327.\n\nSubsequently, as a result of these \"Crude outtakes\", Chevron also obtained other documentation, in the US Section 1782 Litigation, from Mr Donziger, Stratus Consulting and several others. Chevron also took depositions and witness statements from several persons, including Dr Calmbacher, Mr Beltman, Dr Maest and, for 13 days, Mr Donziger himself.269 This unprecedented mass of evidential material, ordinarily protected by journalistic or legal privileges, was a major development for Chevron's case, both for its RICO Litigation in New York and also for this arbitration under the Treaty. It was the product of more than 20 actions brought by Chevron in different US Federal Courts across the USA.270 As of January 2009, however, all this still lay in the future.\n\nMr Donziger's deposition ended on 31 January 2011. Chevron issued its RICO legal proceedings in New York against him and others the next day, on 1 February 2011.\n\nSee the \"US Section 1782 Litigation\" above.\n\n4.328.\n\n*5 January 2009:* Mr Donziger notes in a private email message to himself, regarding his \"Strategic Plan for 2009 Ecuador\": \"\u2026 speed to finish, deal with release, number, reasoned opinion, relationship to alegato, final order for U.S. enforcement, ask for bond and interest to run.\"271 In the Tribunal's view, the reference to the \"reasoned opinion\", in the context of other work to be performed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, likely signified a tentative plan already formed by such representatives covertly to contribute to or draft material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nC-1137, p. 2.\n\n4.329.\n\n*14 January 2009:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representative, Mr Prieto, writes to Mr Donziger and others in early 2009:\n\n*\"\u2026 Let's keep in mind that Texaco is alleging in the United States that the Ecuadorian courts can be politically influenced, and that the Lago Agrio Court is under enormous pressure. The pressure should be felt by the judge, but should be subtle enough that it can't be alleged that he acted due to that pressure \u2026 To understand it, let's think about when [President] Correa visited the region and publicly condemned Texaco. It was definitely a media victory, but Correa's words that day are the basis for Texaco's main argument for saying that the Lago Agrio judge isn't independent and that he obeys Correa's orders. To summarize, this strategy should be as follows: 'increase the pressure on the Court, but without negatively impacting its image of independence.' The political pressure can be in the form of direct calls to the judge. Preferably avoid public threats!! Social and media pressure can be brought to bear in their full force \u2013 because no one can silence the voice of society itself \u2013 but it's different than the voice of the State, which supposedly remains impartial \u2026\"272*\n\nC-1284, p. 1.\n\n4.330.\n\n*4 February 2009:* In an email message to Mr Donziger, Mr S\u00e1enz wrote: \"Dude, if the guys at Jones Day [Chevron's US lawyers] get a hold of this [i.e. the collusive abuse of Criminal Prosecutions against TexPet's two representatives to invalidate the 1995 Settlement Agreement in the Lago Agrio Litigation] it's gonna hurt us. It's pretty much irrefutable evidence of us collaborating with the fiscalia to get Reis Veiga and P\u00e9rez convicted.\"273 Mr Donziger responds, by email: \"\u2026 nothing Chevron says sticks these days, people bring evidence of crimes to prosecutors all the time \u2026 you must understand we are not collaborating with the fiscalia -- we are providing the fiscalia information about a crime, which is appropriate, and that's a big difference.\"274\n\nC-804, p. 2.\n\nC-804, p. 2.\n\n4.331.\n\n*4 March 2009:* By declaration addressed to the Lago Agrio Court (Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez), in response to further accusations of impropriety made by Chevron's Ecuadorian lawyers, Mr Cabrera again attests to his impartiality and independence before the Lago Agrio Court. He states (inter alia):\n\n*\"\u2026 All my work has been public. I have concealed absolutely nothing, my report has been submitted to the Court of Justice to which both parties have had access, I believe, without the least impediment. If my work had been clandestine, the parties would not have been able to photograph the sampling, would not have been able to observe everything that was done in the field, would not have criticized the minor technical details in the field so much\"; and \"\u2026 All the work done was planned, directed, and approved by me, as the person responsible for the expert examination.\"275*\n\nThis statement was false.\n\nC-365, paras 2.1b & 2.2-3.\n\n4.332.\n\n*5 June 2009:* Mr Fajardo informs Mr Donziger that he is giving one of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' legal interns \"a research assignment for our legal alegato and the judgment, but without him knowing what he is doing.\"276 In the Tribunal's view, the latter phrase is a reference to a covert plan for the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Thus, from Mr Fajardo's perspective, this mischief could not be made known to the legal intern.\n\nC-995.\n\n4.333.\n\n*18 June 2009:* Mr Fajardo sends an email message to Mr Donziger, headed \"Trust\", which includes a \"transcription\" of part of the Ecuadorian court decision in *Andrade v. Conelec* (i.e. the \"Fajardo Trust Email\").277 That transcription contains clerical mistakes not found in any published version of the court decision itself.278 Later, these same mistakes appear verbatim in the Lago Agrio Judgment.279 In addition, this email proposes a \"trust\" as \"the method to execute a judgment\". In the Tribunal's view, this is the origin of Part 15 of the Lago Agrio Judgment for a \"trust\" to be formed as the payee of any proceeds from the enforcement of the Judgment, controlled by the ADF and persons designated by the ADF. (The Tribunal returns to these matters below, also in Part V).\n\nC-997, C-1216.\n\nContrast C-997 and C-998.\n\nContrast C-997 and C-998; see C-931, p. 186.\n\n4.334.\n\n*18 June 200* 9: Mr Fajardo sends an email message to Mr Donziger, attaching the Ecuadorian decision in *Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador280* and noting that: \"[t]he arguments by the magistrates are very interesting, I think they serve us well for our alegato and \u2026 [sic]\" The use of an ellipsis was a veiled reference to the covert plan for 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment, given Mr Fajardo's reference only two weeks earlier to the \"alegato and the judgment\" (see above under \"5 June 2009\").281\n\nC-1586, RLA-286.\n\nC-1138.\n\n4.335.\n\n*19 June 2009:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives hold an important meeting in Ecuador. According to Mr Fajardo's email message to Mr Donziger, the participants are to discuss \"all of the outcome of the case and what to do, how much money to put in, how to distribute the items and everything.\"282\n\nC-996.\n\n4.336.\n\n*22 June 2009:* In response to a newspaper article entitled \"State Assumes Environmental Clean Up,\" Mr Fajardo emails his colleagues, expressing concerns that [Chevron] would \"say that the State finally assumed its duty and is going to clean up what it ought to.\" By email headed \"Worrisome\", Mr Donziger responds to Mr S\u00e1enz and copied to his other colleagues, \"You have to go to [President] Correa to put an end to this shit once and for all.\"283 Whilst the Ecuadorian Government's initiative (if such it was) could have benefited the affected local communities, PetroEcuador's remediation activities were seen by Mr Donziger and his colleagues (including Messrs Fajardo, S\u00e1enz, Yanza and Prieto) as an unwelcome threat to their strategy in the Lago Agrio Litigation. The Tribunal infers that the reason for their concerns was the inconsistency with their strategy that Chevron was to be the only person to be held responsible for such pollution and resulting compensation in a significant amount, to the exclusion of PetroEcuador and the Respondent. Given (inter alia) the low estimate for PetroEcuador's remediation costs and the terms of the unilateral waiver of 20 November 1996 ostensibly immunizing PetroEcuador and the Respondent from any like responsibility (see above), such concerns are understandable.\n\nC-1163.\n\n4.337.\n\n*26 July 2009:* Mr Fajardo, in his email message to Mr Donziger, attaches links and texts, adding: \"Some of them are very interesting and, as a matter of fact, will help us with the alegato work and \u2026 [sic]\".284 The same point arises regarding the ellipsis. It referred to the covert plan for ghostwriting the Lago Agrio Judgment (see above).\n\nC-1140.\n\n4.338.\n\n*7 August 2009:* In his email message to Mr Donziger headed \"Meeting with Ecuador Lawyers\",285 Mr Kohn (of Kohn, Swift & Graf) writes (inter alia): \"In order to be effective at all in developing a judgment that will be enforceable in the US and elsewhere we need to be involved in the preparation of the final submission and proposed judgment, the major task we have all agreed upon repeatedly our firm would work on. We have been discussing meeting with our Ecuador lawyers since April or May to begin a working process to get this done \u2026\". This reference to \"developing a judgment\" is ambiguous; but it becomes clearer in later exchanges in September 2009.\n\nC-994.\n\n4.339.\n\n*31 August 2009:* Chevron publicises its allegations that it has videotaped evidence of a bribery scheme implicating Judge Nu\u00f1ez. This had allegedly taken place between 11 May and 22 June 2009 during four private meetings between Judge Nu\u00f1ez, prospective remediation contractors and persons ostensibly representing the Government.286 These allegations depend upon the evidence of Mr Diego Borja (one of the contractors) and video-tapes.287 The latter prove inconclusive; and Mr Borja is soon revealed to be an unreliable witness. Judge Nu\u00f1ez denies any allegation of impropriety; but, after the Ecuadorian judicial authorities begin an investigation, he recuses himself from the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,179.\n\nC-267.\n\n4.340.\n\n*10 September 2009:* The minutes of a meeting between Mr Donziger and lawyers from Kohn, Swift & Graf refer to the \"Creation of Final Order,\" including subheadings for \"Trust or 2 phases\" (under Section XI). Read with the next email, this means the operative part of the Lago Agrio Judgment; i.e. the covert plan for ghostwriting the Lago Agrio Judgment.288\n\nC-1141, item XI.\n\n4.341.\n\n*11 September 2009:* A lawyer from Kohn, Swift & Graf incorporates the minutes of the meeting of 10 September 2009 into an \"Ecuador Task List\", sent to, amongst others, Mr Donziger and Mr Kohn. It states (inter alia): \"KSG will continue to discuss and think about how to structure the judgment\" (Section IIC under \"Legal Issues\").289 This is again a reference to the covert plan for 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nC-1071.\n\n4.342.\n\n*13 September 2009:* When the controversy over Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez emerges and his replacement by Judge Zambrano becomes likely, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' lawyers speculate that someone other than Judge Zambrano would draft Judge Zambrano's orders. They wonder in their internal emails who that someone would be. As stated in Mr Fajardo's email to Mr Donziger dated 13 September 2009, \"I understand that Zambrano himself asked [Judge] N\u00fa\u00f1ez, should the case fall to him, that N\u00fa\u00f1ez help him with the orders. That would help with the continuity. The problem is, who will carry more weight: N\u00fa\u00f1ez on the one hand, or Liliana [Su\u00e0rez, the Lago Agrio Court's clerk] and [Dr] Guerra on the other\u2026\"290 It appears that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and Judge Zambrano chose Dr Guerra. (By now, Dr Guerra was no longer a judge, having been dismissed from the Ecuadorian judiciary in May 2008).\n\nC-1650, p. 1.\n\n4.343.\n\n*15 September 2009:* Mr Fajardo sends an email to Messrs Yanza, Prieto, Saenz and Donziger referring to Judge Zambrano and Dr Guerra as the \"puppet\" and \"puppeteer,\" respectively: \"I think everything is quiet \u2026 The puppeteer is pulling the string and the puppet is returning the package \u2026 By now it's pretty safe that there won't be anything to worry about \u2026 The puppet will finish off the entire matter tomorrow \u2026 I hope they don't fail me \u2026\"291 (Judge Zambrano was not yet formally re-appointed as the judge of the Lago Agrio Court presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation).\n\nC-1652.\n\n4.344.\n\nIn his testimony at the RICO trial, Mr Donziger testified:\n\n*Q: Sir you recall in August 2009, Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez was the subject of recusal proceedings, correct, sir? A: I remember due to the Borja scandal that Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez, I think he removed himself from the case.*\n\n*Q: And you knew that Judge Zambrano would be the person taking over the case from Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez, correct? A: I think I might have been told that by local counsel.*\n\n*Q: And isn't it also the fact that at the time your local Ecuadorian legal team told you that Zambrano was talking to N\u00fa\u00f1ez about N\u00fa\u00f1ez potentially helping him with orders? A: It's possible. I don't remember specifically.292*\n\n*\u2026 Q: Is the puppet Mr Zambrano that's referred to in these emails? A: As I've testified, I have no recollection of who it referred to. I don't even know if I knew at the time. I don't think I paid a whole lot of attention to these emails. However, as I sit here today, I have an understanding of who I think it was and it's not, it is not Zambrano.\"293*\n\nC-2382, p. 2590.\n\nC-2382, p. 2593.\n\n4.345.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the use of code-names at this time is likely the sign of nefarious conduct and guilty minds by the sender and recipients; and that the \"puppet\" was a code name for Judge Zambrano. There is no other cogent explanation. (Judge Zambrano formally became the Lago Agrio Court's judge hearing the Lago Agrio Litigation on 21 October 2009).\n\n4.346.\n\n*23 September 2009* : The Claimants commence these arbitration proceedings against the Respondent under the Treaty, by their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009. It was received by the Respondent on 29 September 2009.\n\n4.347.\n\n*Early October 2009* : Dr Guerra contacts Chevron's Ecuadorian lawyers with an offer to fix with Judge Zambrano both the motion annulling Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez's rulings and \"the entire case\". Chevron declines his offer. Dr Guerra repeats his offer one or two months later. Chevron again declines his offer. Dr Guerra knew that his offers to Chevron were illegal under Ecuadorian law.\n\n4.348.\n\nDr Guerra describes these events in his First Declaration, as follows:\n\n*\"Once it became clear that Mr N\u00fa\u00f1ez would have to withdraw from the Chevron case, Mr Zambrano asked me to attempt, through friends of mine, to get in touch with the attorneys for Chevron in order to negotiate an agreement by which the company would pay Mr Zambrano and me for issuing the final judgment in Chevron's favor. Mr Zambrano told me that Chevron would have much more money than the Plaintiffs for this agreement, and therefore we could get a better deal and greater profits for ourselves. I do not recall the exact date, but approximately between August and October of 2009, I approached attorney Alberto Racines, of Mr Adolfo Callejas' law firm, to tell him I could establish a direct connection with Judge Zambrano so they could discuss and negotiate important and decisive issues in the case, including the judgment. For several weeks I insisted on this deal with Mr Racines, but he rejected my proposal and a relationship with Chevron was never achieved. It was publicly known that I was close to Mr Zambrano, and some attorneys in the city of Lago Agrio, including an attorney close to Chevron's local attorneys, knew that I was writing rulings on his behalf. Now, it must be clearly stated that I have no personal knowledge that Chevron's attorneys ever knew about my agreement with Mr Zambrano and, obviously, Chevron's representatives never paid me for any work I did on behalf of Judge Zambrano.\"294*\n\nC-1616A, para 12.\n\n4.349.\n\nThis account was repeated in Dr Guerra's testimony at the RICO trial295 and at the Track II Hearing.296 It is materially corroborated by the contemporaneous affidavit of Dr Racines dated 16 October 2009;297 and, indirectly, by the affidavit of Dr Adolfo Callejas Ribadeneira to whom Dr Racines reported at the time.298 Whilst, as recorded earlier in this Part IV, the Tribunal exercises caution in accepting Dr Guerra's testimony (for the reasons there explained), the Tribunal accepts this testimony, with its material corroboration, as truthful.\n\nC-2370, p. 916.\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,691ff.\n\nR-1219.\n\nR-1218, paras 4-5.\n\n4.350.\n\nIn his First Declaration, Dr Guerra also testified as follows:\n\n*\"Following Chevron's rejection of any negotiation regarding the judgment, I arranged a meeting with Mr Pablo Fajardo at Mr Zambrano's suggestion. Mr Zambrano told me to have that meeting because he had reached an agreement with the Plaintiffs' representatives to quickly move the case along in their favor, but he did not tell me the details of that agreement. Mr Fajardo and I met in Quito, at the corner of R\u00edo Coca and 6 de Diciembre streets, and we discussed my role as ghostwriter for Mr Zambrano and we agreed on 3 things: (1) I would make the case move quickly; (2) Chevron's procedural options would be limited by not granting their motions on alleged essential errors in rulings I was to write, so the case would not be delayed; and (3) the Plaintiffs' representatives would pay me approximately USD $1,000 per month for writing the court rulings Mr Zambrano was supposed to write. My understanding was that I had to follow these guidelines during the remainder of the case. After a short time, I met with Messrs Fajardo, Donziger and Yanza in the Honey & Honey Restaurant located on Eloy Alfaro and Portugal streets \u2026 \".299*\n\nC-1616A, para 13.\n\n4.351.\n\nThis first restaurant meeting in late 2010 is described separately below. Dr Guerra's account is materially corroborated by subsequent events and forensic evidence regarding his drafting of court orders for Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Dr Guerra knew that his drafting of court orders for Judge Zambrano was illegal under Ecuadorian law, as did Judge Zambrano.\n\n4.352.\n\n*20-21 October 2009* \u2013 Draft Orders #1 and #2 are last saved on Dr Guerra's computer.300 Judge Zambrano's order based on Dr Guerra's Draft Orders #1 and #2 is issued in the Lago Agrio Litigation.301\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4; Lynch ER1, Exhibit 22; and see C-230, p. 2.\n\n4.353.\n\n*21 October 2009:* Judge Zambrano has assumed jurisdiction over the Lago Agrio Litigation. In his order of 21 October 2009, Judge Zambrano denies Chevron's motion to annul Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez's rulings. This motion had been made on the ground that Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez had recused himself after making statements indicating bias and prejudgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.354.\n\n*25 October 2009:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives seek to employ a new lawyer to assist in \"organizing the office's legal information for the alegato and the other project.\" In context, the reference to this unnamed \"other project\" refers to the covert plan to 'ghostwrite' the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n4.355.\n\n*27 October 2009:* In his email to Mr Donziger dated 27 October 2009, Mr Fajardo (again) refers to Dr Guerra as the \"puppeteer\", Judge Zambrano as the \"puppet\" and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' representatives as \"the audience\" when he sends to Messrs Donziger and Yanza an email message with the subject \"News.\" The email states: \"The puppeteer won't move his puppet until the audience doesn't pay him something \u2026\"302 As before, this use of code-names indicates nefarious conduct and guilty minds by both sender and recipient.\n\nC-1617A.\n\n4.356.\n\n*20 October 2009:* A draft order is last saved on Dr Guerra's computer prior to Judge Zambrano issuing an order with materially matching text (on 27 October 2009).303\n\nC-1616A, Attachment O.\n\n4.357.\n\n*29 October 2009:* The sum of US$1,000 is withdrawn from the Selva Viva bank account.304 The bank records of Dr Guerra's bank account show a contemporaneous deposit of US$1,000.305 The Tribunal finds that this payment, as also subsequent payments to Dr Guerra, were bribes made by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives to Dr Guerra.\n\nC-1661, p. 2.\n\nTorres ER, Exhibit 50, p. 3.\n\n4.358.\n\n*27 October 2009:* Judge Zambrano issues his order based on Dr Guerra's draft order (of 20 October 2009).306\n\nC-878.\n\n4.359.\n\n*18 November 2009:* Dr Guerra last saves Draft Orders #3 and #4 to his computer with text substantially identical to the text of an order issued five days later by Judge Zambrano (on 23 November 2009).307\n\nC-1616A, Attachment P; Lynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.360.\n\n*19 November 2009:* Dr Guerra ships a package to Ms Narcisa Leon (a Lago Agrio Court employee).308 The Tribunal finds that this package included Dr Guerra's draft order intended for Judge Zambrano.\n\nC-1616A, Attachment F.\n\n4.361.\n\n*23 November 2009:* Judge Zambrano issues an order with text materially identical to text found in the drafts saved on Dr Guerra's computer five days earlier (18 November 2009).309\n\nLynch ER1, Exhibit 23; Table 4.\n\n4.362.\n\n*26-27 November 2009* : The sum of US$1,000 is withdrawn from the Selva Viva bank account.310 A deposit of US$1,000 in cash is made contemporaneously to Dr Guerra's bank account.311.\n\nC-1661, p. 2.\n\nTorres ER, Exhibit 51, p. 3.\n\n4.363.\n\n*27 November 2009:* Mr Yanza sends an email to Mr Donziger, stating: \"[I]t is important to clarify on this that the budget is higher in relation to the previous months, since we are paying the puppeteer [i.e. Dr Guerra] \u2026 In addition, in reviewing the accounts with Alexandra [Achundia], we have not included in the debits report from the previous months some expenses that we incurred months ago, for example, when we bought \u2026 another computer (because we had to give one to the man).\"312 The Tribunal has not found it possible, with sufficient probability, to identify this \"man\" or the purpose for which this computer was supplied to him.\n\nC-1657, p. 2.\n\n4.364.\n\n*29-30 November 2009:* Draft order #5 is last saved to Dr Guerra's computer.313 Dr Guerra ships a package to Ms Narcisa Leon of the Lago Agrio Court.314 The Tribunal finds that this package included Dr Dr Guerra's draft intended for Judge Zambrano. The next day, Judge Zambrano issues an order in the Lago Agrio Litigation with text substantially identical to the text from the Draft Order #5 saved to Dr Guerra's computer one day earlier.315\n\nC-1616A, Attachment Q; Lynch ER1, Table 4.\n\nC-1616A, Attachment F.\n\nC-1809; Lynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.365.\n\n*6-7 December 2009:* Draft Order #6 is last saved to Dr Guerra's computer.316 The next day, Judge Zambrano issues an order in the Lago Agrio Litigation with text that matches the text of the draft order saved to Dr Guerra's computer one day earlier.317\n\nC-1616A, Attachment R.\n\nC-1812; Lynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.366.\n\n*12-14 December 2009* : Draft Order #7 last saved on Dr Guerra's computer.318 Two days later, an order based on Draft Order #7 is issued by Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation.319\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.367.\n\n*19 December 2009* : Draft Order #8 is last saved on Dr Guerra's computer.320\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4; C-1616A, Attachment F.\n\n4.368.\n\n*22-23 December 2009* : The sum of US$1,000 is withdrawn from the Selva Viva bank account.321 Ms Ximena Centeno (of Selva Viva) deposits contemporaneously US$1,000 into Dr Guerra's bank account at Banco Pichincha.322\n\nC-1661, p. 51.\n\nTorres ER, Exhibit 24.\n\n4.369.\n\n*29 December 2009* : Mr Fajardo reassures Mr Donziger that he was \"99.9 percent sure\" that the \"plan for the judgment\" would be fulfilled; but that he could not send any details by email.\"323 By this last comment, the Tribunal understands that Mr Fajardo was already aware that Chevron might obtain, by court order in the USA, access to Mr Donziger's email messages (as it eventually did). It was thus necessary for Mr Fajardo to be discreet in the use of language in referring to the covert plan for the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nC-1001.\n\n4.370.\n\nAs for the reference to the \"plan for the judgment\", Mr Donziger confirmed in the RICO Litigation that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs \"never publicly on the record submitted a proposed judgment in Lago Agrio.\"324 The Tribunal considers that Mr Fajardo's phrase referred to the covert plan to 'ghostwrite' the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nC-1003 (updated), p. 4758.\n\n***2010***\n----------\n\n4.371.\n\n*5 January 2010:* Order based on Dr Guerra's Draft Order #8 (of 19 December 2009) is issued by Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation.325\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.372.\n\n*16-19 January 2010* : Draft Order #9 last saved on Dr Guerra's Computer.326 Order of 19 January 2010 based on Dr Guerra's Draft Order #9 is issued by Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation.327\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.373.\n\n*29 January - 2 February 2010:* Draft Order #10 is last saved on Dr Guerra's Computer.328 Four days later, the order based on Draft Order #10 is issued by Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation.329\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\n4.374.\n\n*5 February 2010:* Ms Ximena Centeno (of Selva Viva) deposits the sum of US$1,000 into Dr Guerra's bank account at Banco Pichincha.330\n\nTorres ER, Exhibit 25.\n\n4.375.\n\n*18 February 2010:* A Draft Order #11 has been saved to Dr Guerra's computer. On 18 February 2010, the order based on Dr Guerra's draft order is issued by Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation.331 On 7 March 2010, Draft Order #11 is last saved on Dr Guerra's Computer, using the \"Save As\" function indicating the existence of an earlier draft.332\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4.\n\nLynch ER1, Table 4; Track II Hearing D5,942.\n\n4.376.\n\n*11 March 2010:* Judge Zambrano is succeeded by Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.377.\n\n*30 March 2010* : In his email message, Mr Prieto (in Ecuador) writes to Mr Donziger (copied to Messrs Fajardo, Yanza and Saenz) to complain at the result of the production to Chevron of the 'Crude outtakes' and other materials in the legal proceedings in the USA:\n\n*\"Today Pablo [Fajardo] and Lu\u00eds [Yanza] were kind enough to tell us what was going on in Denver [this was a reference to Chevron's legal proceedings against Stratus Consulting before the US Federal Court in Denver under US Section 1782], and the fact that certainly ALL will be made public, including correspondence. [T]he problem, my friend, is that the effects are potentially devastating in Ecuador (apart from destroying the proceeding, all of us, your attorneys, might go to jail), and we are not willing to minimize our concern and to sit to wait for whatever happens. For us its NOT acceptable for the correspondence, the emails, between Stratus Consulting and Juanpa and myself be divulged. To avoid this, we have decided to file a writ of protection before a judge in Ecuador, asking the judge to write to the judge in Denver not to reveal the correspondence because this would affect our fundamental rights. This is an idea that may not work, but with adequate support perhaps we can do it. I am telling you so you'll know. We will send you the document.\"333*\n\nC-930. These legal proceedings were an application by Chevron to the US District Court of Colorado under Section 1782 made on 18 December 2009. It eventually resulted in an order against Stratus Consulting of 1 October 2010.\n\n4.378.\n\nThe reference to \"jail\" is significant. Criminal proceedings could have arisen from unlawful conduct over the bribing of Messrs Reyes and Pinto, the blackmailing of Judge Y\u00e1nez, the corrupt collusion with Mr Cabrera, the 'ghostwriting' of Mr Cabrera's Report, the bribes paid to Dr Guerra for drafting Judge Zambrano's orders, the inappropriate private meetings with several judges of the Lago Agrio Court, the collusive criminal proceedings against Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez and the covert plan for 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment. (There was apparently no written reply from Mr Donziger to this email message).\n\n4.379.\n\n*14 May 2010:* This Tribunal issues its Order on Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010: see its Operative Part above in Annex 1(A) to Part I above.\n\n4.380.\n\n*17 June 2010:* By letter dated 17 June 2010 to the Tribunal's Secretary, responding to Paragraph 1(v) of its Order on Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez) writes as follows:\n\n*\"Through this letter, I want to communicate that the Attorney General's Office of the Republic of Ecuador has informed me of the Order on Provisional Measures, dated May 14, 2010, ordered by the Tribunal chaired by you within the international arbitration filed by the companies Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company against Ecuador, where I am invited to give an indication, as a professional courtesy to the Arbitration Tribunal, of the possible date for the issuance by the Presidency of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumb\u00edos, of a decision regarding lawsuit No.-002- 2003-P-CSNL, which is brought by Mar\u00eda Aguinda and others against the Company Chevron Corporation, for compensation for environmental damages.*\n\n*In this regard, I must inform you that, within Ecuadorian procedural rules, there are no provisions that enable me to state a precise date for the issuance of the decision regarding said lawsuit; however, taking into consideration the length of the proceedings (185,152 pages), according to my professional experience as a Judge and my study of the proceedings to date, I foresee that a decision may possibly be arrived at in 8 to 10 months; nevertheless, this period may vary due to reasons beyond our control, or events we cannot foresee at this time in connection with the proceedings.\"334*\n\nR-118 (sent with the Respondent's assistance, as requested by the Tribunal).\n\n4.381.\n\n*July 2010:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives dismiss Mr Kohn and his law firm as advisers and funders from the Lago Agrio Litigation.335\n\nC-2374, pp. 1510-1511.\n\n4.382.\n\n*14 July 2010: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI):336 Windows XP is installed on the \"Old Computer\" of Judge Zambrano. A significant amount of data was then copied to the Old Computer.337 The transfer included documents named \"Caso Texaco.doc\" and \"Providencias.doc\".338\n\nThese references to the Forensic Evidence should be read with their corresponding fuller explanations in Part VI below. To avoid repetition, such explanations are not set out in this Part IV.\n\nLynch ER2, p. 11.\n\nLynch ER2, Exhibit 23.\n\n4.383.\n\nThe Old Computer was not found to contain any of the nine draft orders prepared by Dr Guerra for the Lago Agrio Court during Judge Zambrano's first period as the judge presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation (21 October 2009 to 11 March 2010). The subsequent installation of Windows XP on 14 July 2010 is the likely explanation.\n\n4.384.\n\n*23 July 2010* : A Western Digital 120 GB hard drive is attached as an external storage device to Dr Guerra's computer. The 11 Draft Orders were copied to the computer hard drive as part of a much larger transfer process during which 4,325 files and folders were placed on the computer hard drive.339 An operating system was installed on Dr Guerra's Hard Drive. 11 Documents were created on Dr Guerra's Hard Drive.340\n\nLynch ER1, p. 9, fn 6.\n\nLynch ER1, para 15; Racich ER2 paras 7(a) & 11.\n\n4.385.\n\n*2 August 2010* : The false origins of the \"Cabrera Reports\" are raised by Chevron in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Chevron had received the off-cuts from \"Crude\" in July 2010. Following an application in the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez) issues an order allowing the reports attributed to Mr Cabrera to be substituted by 'cleansing' expert reports, to be submitted within 45 days.341\n\nC-361.\n\n4.386.\n\n*18 August 2010:* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives consider the effect of Mr Cabrera's departure as the Lago Agrio Court's sole global assessment expert and his replacement with the parties' cleansing experts. This includes an email message, marked \"privileged and confidential \u2013 attorney work product\", from Mr Small (of Patton Boggs) to Mr Donziger: \"While our new expert [sic] will most likely rely on some of the same data as Cabrera (and come to the same conclusions as Cabrera) \u2026 we probably wouldn't want to draw that much attention to Cabrera \u2026 our expert might address Cabrera's findings in such a subtle way that someone reading the new expert report (the Court in Lago or an enforcement court elsewhere) might feel comfortable concluding that certain parts of Cabrera are a valid basis for damages.\"342\n\nC-1250.\n\n4.387.\n\nNone of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' cleansing experts visit Ecuador, inspect the former concession area or conduct any sampling or environmental testing, as Mr Donziger later confirmed during his testimony in the RICO Litigation.343 The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs produce their seven expert reports on 16 September 2010, submitted to the Lago Agrio Court within the 45 days' time limit.344\n\nC-1087; pp. 1652-1653.\n\nC-1087; pp. 1652-1653.\n\n4.388.\n\nOne of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' cleansing experts, Dr Lawrence W. Barnthouse, relies upon the Cabrera Report \"to see exactly how he [Cabrera] had done it.\"345 The Lago Agrio Judgment in turn relies upon Dr Barnthouse to arrive at its damages of US$ 200,000,000 for the recovery of flora, fauna and aquatic life.346 Hence, the Lago Agrio Judgment indirectly relies upon the Cabrera Report.347 The Tribunal returns to this matter below: see Part V.\n\nC-899, pp. 55 & 165.\n\nC-931, page 182.\n\nC-931, p. 182.\n\n4.389.\n\nFor its damages of US$ 5,396 billion for soil remediation, the Lago Agrio Judgment's calculation based upon 880 pits can only be traced back to Annex H1 to the Cabrera Report (\"Anexo H1\") and not, as the Judgment and the Clarification Order state, \"various aerial photographs\".348 Anexo H1 to the Cabrera Report had not, in fact, been drafted by Mr Cabrera, but prepared by Stratus and falsely attributed to Mr Cabrera by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. The Tribunal returns to this matter below: see Part V.\n\nC-931, pp. 124-125; C-1367, p. 15.\n\n4.390.\n\n*August 2010:* In or about August 2010, Patton Boggs produce for the representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs a lengthy undated memorandum entitled \"Path Forward: Securing and Enforcing Judgment and Reaching Settlement\" or, in shorthand, the \"Invictus Memorandum\".349 It sets out (inter alia) a legal strategy for seizing Chevron's assets outside Ecuador in multiple jurisdictions, including the arrest of Chevron's vessels.350 These jurisdictions included the USA, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Venezuela, Canada, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Belgium, Indonesia, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and Russia.\n\nIt was doubtless called \"Invictus\" after the well-known poem by William Ernest Henley.\n\nC-903.\n\n4.391.\n\nThe conclusion of the Invictus Memorandum reads (in part):\n\n*\"After approximately seventeen total years of litigation in the United States and in Ecuador, the case against Chevron now enters its most critical, multi-faceted, and labor-intensive phase. As described herein, there are challenges and risks, but all are manageable. With the ultimate goal of effecting a swift and favorable settlement in mind, the strategy of Plaintiffs' Team over the coming months preceding and following entry of a judgment will incorporate the following components: \u2026*\n\n*\\* Securing a defensible and enforceable judgment in Ecuador by executing an effective alegato finale and submitting a persuasive, thoughtful submission on damages that will, in many ways, moot Chevron's criticism of the Cabrera Report \\* Identifying jurisdictions globally that are most hospitable to an enforcement action, with the goal that careful selection and an investment of time on the front end will simplify the process substantially on the back-end.*\n\n*\\* Identifying Chevron's most vulnerable assets and determining whether prejudgment attachment is a viable option for placing settlement pressure on Chevron in the various jurisdictions where enforcement is contemplated\u2026\"*\n\n4.392.\n\nLater, as reported in *ecuardoinmediato.com* on 3 March 2012 (shortly after the Lago Agrio Judgment became enforceable),351 Mr S\u00e1enz (of the Lago Agrio representatives) stated: \" \u2026 we can immediately go to carry out the compulsory enforcement of the judgment. We have several teams around the world who are ready to seize tankers, shares, production. In view of the fact that Chevron has no significant assets in this country, assets in Panama and Venezuela may be seized, for which the timing has been analysed and the trust was signed yesterday, the attorney says\". (This trust was created under the terms of the Lago Agrio Judgment, designating it the beneficiary of the judgment's proceeds: see Part V below).\n\nC-1133 (updated), p. 2.\n\n4.393.\n\n*5 September 2010:* In his email message, Dr Guerra writes to Mr Donziger:352\n\n*\"Alberto Guerra Bastidas here, apart from a warm greeting, I would appreciate your helping my daughter Gabriela Guerra with respect to the mechanics of obtaining her residence in the United States. She entered [the USA] last October of 2009 with a tourist visa. Later, in June of 2010 she changed her status from tourist to student, so she is legal for one year until June 2011. She has an American boyfriend who for the purpose of making her legal, and for love, she says, they want to get married. Questions: is it more convenient to have the wedding in the US or in Ecuador. With the marriage how long will it take to get the residency worked out. What is an estimate of the cost of the procedures \u2013 and attorney's fees. By the way, my daughter is in Chicago. I will support the matter of Pablo Fajardo so it will come out soon and well.\"*\n\nTorres ER, Exhibit 26.\n\n4.394.\n\nThe last sentence in Dr Guerra's email is ambiguous; but, in context and as explained by Dr Guerra himself at the Track II Hearing,353 it indicates, at the very least, an inappropriate willingness to assist Mr Fajardo in the Lago Agrio Litigation. There is no reply in evidence before this Tribunal from Mr Donziger to Dr Guerra.\n\nTrack II Hearing D4,890.\n\n4.395.\n\n*17 September 2010* : The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez) issues its procedural order (autos para sentencia), closing the evidential file in the Lago Agrio Litigation and preparing the case for judgment.354 Later, Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez recuses himself on 10 October 2010; he is succeeded by Judge Zambrano on 11 October 2010; and by his procedural order of 11 October 2010, Judge Zambrano revokes Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez's order of 17 September 2010.355\n\nC-642.\n\nC-643.\n\n4.396.\n\n*October 2010:* By October 2010, Chevron has filed several US Section 1782 applications in the USA, against Mr Donziger, Stratus Consulting and others; and it had already received multiple document productions from Mr Donziger and Stratus Consulting, in addition to the \"Crude Outtakes\".\n\n4.397.\n\n*6 October 2010* : As he subsequently testified by affidavit, Dr Enrique Carvajal Salas (a lawyer for Chevron in Ecuador) describes a meeting with a friend in Quito on 6 October 2010:\n\n*\"In that meeting, my \u2026 friend told me, based on his discussion with Dr Guerra, that Judge Zambrano would no longer try to reach some agreement with Chevron because he was aware that the company would not make financial arrangements with anybody, but, instead, that Judge Zambrano was sure to do so with the plaintiffs [i.e. the [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs]. I understood this to mean that Judge Zambrano would reach an agreement with the plaintiffs to receive money from them in exchange for issuing the judgment in the Aguinda case in their favor.\"356*\n\nR-1318, para 5; see also R-1218, para. 8.\n\n4.398.\n\nSubsequently, in \"late April 2012\" after the Lago Agrio Judgment had been issued, Dr Carvajal runs into Dr Guerra, they greet each other, and: \"As I walked away, Dr Guerra came running up behind me. When I turned around, Dr Guerra said, 'Dr Carvajal, I want to tell you that I would like to make any kind of statement about the fact that I helped to prepare the first instance judgment'. I immediately answered: 'You, and who else?' After some hesitation, he answered: 'Fajardo and Zambrano'. Then he added: 'I am willing to make a public statement \u2026\".357\n\nR-1318, para 6.\n\n4.399.\n\nDr Carvajal's testimony as regards both events is corroborated by the affidavit of Dr Adolfo Callejas Ribadeneira, to whom Dr Carvajal reported at the time.358\n\nR-1218, paras 8 and 9.\n\n4.400.\n\nIn his affidavit, Dr Callejas describes another event taking place in \"approximately the last quarter of 2010\":\n\n*\"\u2026 another one of the lawyers on my legal team in the Aguinda case, Dr Patricio Efrain Campuzano Merino, told me that, earlier that day, he received a telephone call from \u2026 who said she had something important to discuss with him regarding the Aguinda case, and that he met her shortly thereafter. Dr Campuzano told me that, in his meeting with \u2026 she said that Judge Zambrano wanted to know whether Chevron would be interested in drafting the final judgment of the trial court in favour of Chevron in the Aguinda case. Dr Campuzano told me that he understood Dr Guerra had conveyed that information to \u2026 Based on Dr Campuzano's recitation of his discussion with \u2026 I understood \u2026 to mean that Chevron could pay an amount of money to Judge Zambrano to obtain and ghostwrite a judgment in its favour in the Aguinda case.

The second occasion is for Messrs Fajardo, Yanza and Donziger to discuss paying Dr Guerra and Judge Zambrano for a judgment drafted (i.e. 'ghostwritten') by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. According to Dr Guerra, Judge Zambrano later informs Dr Guerra that he (Judge Zambrano) had made direct contact with Mr Fajardo, and that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives had agreed to pay US$ 500,000 in exchange for allowing them to write the Lago Agrio Judgment, from which Dr Guerra would receive \"a proper benefit\".365. Judge Zambrano tells Dr Guerra that he would share part of the money with him, once it was paid to him.366\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,725.\n\nC-2358 (also C-2386), paras 41-43.\n\n4.406.\n\nAt the RICO trial in New York, Dr Guerra testified as follows:\n\n*\"Q. What if anything happened at that meeting at the Honey [&] Honey restaurant? A. At that meeting I took it upon myself to summarize in detail the proposal made by Mr Zambrano, and I obviously stated expressly regarding his intent of receiving at least $500,000 \u2026 Mr Donziger and the whole group \u2026 stated that they regretted it very much, but that for the time being, at that time they didn't have the money that Mr Zambrano was requesting.\"367*\n\nC-2371, pp. 995-996.\n\n4.407.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing in this arbitration, Dr Guerra testified orally in similar terms:\n\n*\"Q. Did you have a meeting with anyone in September or October 2010, at the Honey [&] Honey restaurant in Quito? A. I did. At that time I met with Mr Steven Donziger, with Pablo Fajardo, Luis Yanza, who represented the Plaintiffs against Chevron in Ecuador.*\n\n*Q. What did you say to them at that meeting? A. Specifically at that meeting, I conveyed a message from Judge Nicolas Zambrano related to the fact that he would accept for them to prepare the draft Judgment in the Chevron Case, in exchange of the sum of at least $500,000\"368*\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,600.\n\n4.408.\n\nAt the RICO trial in New York, Mr Donziger testified that he met Dr Guerra at a restaurant in Quito in late 2010 and that Dr Guerra there solicited a bribe from him:\n\n*\"Q: You admit, sir, that you met with Mr Guerra [at] a restaurant called the Honey [&] Honey in late 2010, correct, sir? A: I met with him at a restaurant in Quito.*\n\n*Q:**An d it was Mr Fajardo who arranged that meeting, correct, sir? A: I believe*\n\n*Q: So [Dr Guerra] made clear to you in exchange for a $500,000 bribe, he could fix the case with the judge on the Lago Agrio case at the time, correct, sir? A: Something to that effect, yeah. He basically said he could get it done for a payment.\"*\n\n*Q: And your testimony, sir, is you told [Dr Guerra] no, we can't do that, correct, that's your testimony? A: Yes.\"369370*\n\nC-2382, p. 2597.\n\nC-2382, pp. 2597-2598.\n\n4.409.\n\n*27 October 2010:* Judge Zambrano issues an order refusing to consider evidence of the \"Cabrera fraud\" in the Lago Agrio Litigation, following a request by Chevron to admit such evidence.371\n\nC-878.\n\n4.410.\n\n*31 October 2010* : The Intercreditor Agreement is executed, in counterparts, by Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo, Patton Boggs, Mr Yanza, the ADF and others on the distribution of proceeds from the Lago Agrio Litigation. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs rank ninth and last in the \"distribution waterfall\" (Clause 3.2.9).372 This Agreement accompanied the \"Burford Funding Agreement\", also of 31 October 2010.373\n\nC-1218.\n\nC-1217.\n\n4.411.\n\nIn his deposition in the US Section 1182 Litigation on 1 December 2010, Mr Donziger stated that it is possible that he might receive personally \"hundreds of millions\" of US dollars from a favourable judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation.374\n\n*\"Q. Is it fair to say that you have an expectation that you, Steven Donziger, might receive as much as hundreds of millions of dollars in the event that there is a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in that case?\u2026 A. It is possible. It depends on the amount of the overall recovery. I misspoke two questions ago. I don't know if it would be appropriate to try to correct something.*\n\n*Q. Please go ahead. A. The amount -- the top end of the overall recovery of attorneys' fees is now lower than that agreement based on an oral understanding with the clients. It is lower than 25 percent.*\n\n*Q. What is it now? A. It is 20 percent.*\n\n*Q. And when was that changed? A. This year, a few months ago. I don't know when exactly.*\n\n*Q. And for what reason? A. Various reasons, but that [sic] this stage of the case we are trying to bring in new firms and funds to sustain the case. So in coming up with a formula that would make all of that work, the total amount of the attorneys' fees dropped.\"375*\n\nC-697, pp. 547-549.\n\nLater, at the RICO trial, Mr Donziger also testified that he stood to receive US$ 600 million personally from the proceeds of the Lago Agrio Judgment: see C-2381, p. 2490.\n\n4.412.\n\nThe Tribunal has also been shown a \"pie chart\" produced for the US State Department of 20 December 2011 (after the Lago Agrio Judgment), showing the following figures:376 From a \"total recovery\" by external \"Funders, Lawyers, and Advisors\" of US$ 5,741,211,538 on US$ 18,156,936,000, Donziger & Associates would receive US$ 1,143,886,968, Mr Fajardo US$ 363,138,720, Patton Boggs US$ 435,768,464 and the Burford Group (as the major non-party funder) US$ 1,006,802,101.377 Mr Donziger had earlier prepared (for internal use only) documents showing other figures for shares in the proceeds of a successful Lago Agrio Judgment, including Mr DeLeon, Mr Yanza & Mr Fajardo, on 13 April 2009378 and February 2010.379 The Lago Agrio Complaint had requested that the ADF be the payee of Chevron's judgment debt, together with 10% of the judgment's value. (The Lago Agrio Judgment was to award this 10% in the sum of US$ 864 million or, potentially, US$ 1.82 billion).\n\nR-1082 (it appears that this information originated from Chevron).\n\nBurford's interest in the Lago Agrio Litigation, as a non-party funder, began in or about September 2010 [C779]. It resulted in the Funding Agreement dated 31 October 2010, signed by Treca Financial Solutions (as the \"Funder\") and by the ADF and Messrs Donziger, Fajardo and Yanza (\"for the Claimants\") (C-1217), on the same day as the Intercreditor Agreement (C-1218).\n\nC-748.\n\nC-767 to C-770.\n\n4.413.\n\n*4 November 2010: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): Microsoft Excel is active on Judge Zambrano's Old Computer for one minute.380\n\nLynch ER2, Table 6.\n\n4.414.\n\n*25 November 2010: Forensic Evidence (See* Part VI): First User Account, named HP, is created on Judge Zambrano's \"New Computer\".381\n\nLynch ER2, p. 12.\n\n4.415.\n\n*2 December 2010: Forensic Evidence (See* Part VI): Fielweb.com is accessed using the Old Computer.382\n\nLynch ER3, p. 13.\n\n4.416.\n\n*6 December 2010:* This Tribunal issues its Second Order on Interim Measures dated 6 December 2010: see Annex 1(B) to Part I above.\n\n4.417.\n\nPursuant to this procedural order, the Tribunal (by its President) writes to Judge Zambrano at the Lago Agrio Court the following letter of 6 December 2010 (in both English and Spanish):\n\n*\"I have the pleasure of addressing you in my capacity as President of the Arbitral Tribunal presiding over the international arbitration captioned PCA Case No. 2009-23: 'Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. The Republic of Ecuador'.*\n\n*In that capacity, and on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunal, I write in order to invite you, as a professional courtesy, and in conformity with your duties to the Parties in the case named in the subject line above, to make known to the Arbitral Tribunal and to the Parties to that case, as far in advance as may be reasonably possible, the likely date that you will render judgment on the merits in that case.*\n\n*I make reference in this regard to the letter dated 17 June 2010 from the Presidency of the Provincial Court of Sucumbios, wherein Judge Leonardo Isaac Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Pi\u00f1a, formerly seized of the case, kindly responded to a similar prior invitation from the Arbitral Tribunal transmitted by the Attorney General and stated at that time that 'taking into consideration the length of the proceedings (185,152 pages), according to my professional experience as a Judge and my study of the proceedings to date, I foresee that a decision may possibly be arrived at in 8 to 10 months'*383\n\n*I request, for the above purpose, and to avoid any delays in the communication of this information to the Arbitral Tribunal, that this information be transmitted, in addition to any other means, also by e-mail and facsimile, to the following person and address:*\n\n*Martin Doe Permanent Court of Arbitration, [postal, fax and email addresses supplied.*\n\n*In the event it is possible for you to transmit this communication also by courier, I enclose herein a prepaid FedEx envelope with the above address, in order to allow transmission to the Arbitral Tribunal also by that means.*\n\n*I thank you kindly in advance for your attention to this matter and your acceptance of the request set out in this letter \u2026.\"*\n\nR-118 (as sent with the Respondent's assistance: see above).\n\n4.418.\n\nThe Tribunal receives no response to this letter from the Lago Agrio Court or Judge Zambrano as the judge now presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n4.419.\n\n*7 December 2010: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): First apparent use of the HP Account on Judge Zambrano's New Computer.384\n\nLynch ER2, p. 12\n\n4.420.\n\n*17 December 2010* : In his email dated 17 December 2010 to certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, including Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo writes:\n\n*\"I hereby express my deep concern given the noncompliance with the completion of the legal argument for the main case, or the Lago Agrio case.*\n\n*I imagine that you are all aware of this \u2013 that the case is closing in Ecuador. From our analysis, we can deduce that the Judge can issue a writ for judgment at any time, any day; this means that we must have our legal argument ready, defined and we must all be in agreement with it, in order to submit it to the Court at any time.*\n\n*We have spoken a great deal on this matter. We have reached agreements to finish as quickly as possible, but to date, there is no real response. My friends, I think we cannot wait any longer. Thus, given this noncompliance, we will develop a second alternative.*\n\n*The subsidiary alternative, is that we will draft an argument solely with the vision of Ecuador, in the event that we must submit the argument in the next days, we will present only the document that we prepare \u2013 the rest will be set on a back-burner, if it is completed some day. I hope that this decision does not cause internal problems, but it is the option that would allow us to meet the Court's demands, in the event that we have to do so.*\n\n*The only possibility, if we are able to prepare the document and we can later correct it in Ecuador, and finally, we can submit it with the Court without any problem, is for the Judge not to issue a writ for judgment; but this scenario is not within our reach. This judge is very firm and exercises a great deal of authority; he is punishing any attempt to delay the proceeding.*\n\n*Further, in the event that a writ for judgment is issued, it is certain that Chevron will timely submit its argument, which would be an enormous disadvantage for us if we fail to submit the document.*\n\n*I need immediate answers.\"385*\n\nR-988.\n\n4.421.\n\nThe terms of this email are, ostensibly, inconsistent with Mr Fajardo's knowledge of any scheme whereby certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives were then 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment. The explanation, however, is straightforward. The recipients of this email included persons who had no such knowledge; and it would have served no purpose for Mr Fajardo to inform them otherwise. Several of the recipients were also amenable to the jurisdiction of the US Courts, including discovery under Section 1782. Moreover, as already indicated, Mr Fajardo knew by this time that any email to Mr Donziger would likely end up in the hands of Chevron as a result of US litigation \u2013 as it did.\n\n4.422.\n\n*17 December 2010:* Judge Zambrano issues \"autos para sentencia\", formally closing the evidentiary phase of the proceedings in the Lago Agrio Litigation.386\n\nC-894.\n\n4.423.\n\n*20 December 2010:* In his email dated 20 December 2010 to certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, including Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo writes of his concern as to \"how the Judge will respond to this new argument set forth by Chevron \u2026:.387 This concern is again, ostensibly, inconsistent with Mr Fajardo's knowledge of any scheme whereby certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives were then 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment. In the Tribunal's view, again, the explanation lies in the range of recipients who were not privy to the 'ghostwriting' or subject to the jurisdiction of the USA courts.\n\nR-989.\n\n4.424.\n\n*21 December 2010: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): \"Providencias.docx\" is saved by a user of the Old Computer. It had been open for 2,107 minutes (35.12 hours) in the period between 11 October 2010 and 21 December 2010. At this stage the document contained 42% of the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment.388 This version of \"Providencias.docx\" is the earliest file found on the Zambrano Computers that contains text of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nLynch ER2, Exhibit 23; Racich ER2, para 13.\n\n4.425.\n\n*28 December 2010: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): \"Providencias.docx\" is saved on the Old Computer. The document had been open for 1,046 minutes (17.5 hours) since 21 December 2010, making a total of 3,153 minutes (52.62 hours) for the period between 11 October 2010 and 28 December 2010. This version of \"Providencias.docx\" contains 66% of the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment.389\n\nLynch ER2, Exhibit 23; Racich ER2, para 14.\n\n4.426.\n\nThis version also contains text and nine citations to US court decisions materially identical to the unfiled Erion Memorandum of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives; and two citations to legal materials in the unfiled Moodie Memorandum of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. (These wordings are subsequently edited for the final version Lago Agrio Judgment, as issued). Text and statistics from the unfiled Selva Database are also contained in this version of \"Providencias.docx\". (The Tribunal returns to these matters in Parts V and VI below).\n\n4.427.\n\n*31 December 2010* : In his email dated 31 December 2010 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, Mr Fajardo writes:\n\n*\"\u2026no one knows when the Judge may issue his judgment; he could do so within two weeks, or within many months or even years. If he does so many months from now, the judge may possibly consider the legal reports [\"informes en derecho\"]; but if the judge issues his judgment soon, the document will remain in our hands and will be useless. We will not run this risk\u2026 I'm sorry my friend, but we are behind schedule with this memorandum of law, which could have serious consequences for the case\".390*\n\nR-896.\n\n4.428.\n\nAgain, the terms of this email are, ostensibly, inconsistent with Mr Fajardo's knowledge of any scheme whereby certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives were then 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment. The explanation, however, is again straightforward. The recipients of this email included a person in the USA who had no knowledge of 'ghostwriting'; and it would have served no good purpose (from Mr Fajardo's perspective) to inform him otherwise. Moreover, Mr Fajardo must have been by now well aware that any email message to Mr Donziger would fall into the hands of Chevron under US Court orders, sooner or later.\n\n***2011***\n----------\n\n4.429.\n\n*4 January 2011: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): \"fielweb.com\" is accessed using Judge Zambrano's Old Computer.391\n\nLynch ER3, p. 13.\n\n4.430.\n\n*4 January 2011: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): \"windowslivetranslator.com\" is accessed using Judge Zambrano's New Computer.

I found that Chevron, on Thursday, January 6, 2011, at 5:55 p.m., had already filed their legal alegato. It is a short 292 page document and their theories are amply briefed. As you can see, my concerns are well founded. Chevron has gotten ahead of us by filing their alegato, while we are still writing ours. All the more reason to speed up our work, otherwise the Judge could be convinced by Chevron's theory \u2026\"*392\n\nR-897, p. 2.\n\n4.432.\n\nAgain, however, the Tribunal considers that explanation is the same as with his email messages of 17, 20 and 31 December 2010. (Moreover, by January 2011, the Federal Court in New York had ordered Mr Donziger to disclose his computers' hard drives, in addition to email messages and other documentation).\n\n4.433.\n\n*17 January 2011* : The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs file their alegato with the Lago Agrio Court.393 It is a pleading of some 118 pages. In the alegato, it is submitted (inter alia) that the Ecuadorian legal system \"recognizes circumstances when it is appropriate to hold a parent company liable for the actions of a separately established subsidiary (page 94). It concludes:\n\n*\"Chevron's attempt to now pretend that it and Texaco and Texpet are genuinely independent and invoke the corporate veil to avoid liability is clearly an abuse and manipulation of the legal instrument of corporate separation, and fraudulent perhaps by design but in any event in result, which, as discussed above, is all that is required to pierce the corporate veil under Ecuadorian law. Moreover, Chevron's attempt to shift liability to flagrantly undercapitalized entities (Texaco and TexPet) is also clear evidence of fraud (by result or by intent) sufficient to pierce the corporate veil. Finally, the fact that Chevron is invoking this immunity strategy even after explicitly promising to the U.S. court and the plaintiffs that it would submit to litigation of these claims in Ecuador and abide by any judgment, is simply more evidence of fraud that justifies lifting the corporate veil in this case.\" (page 99).*\n\nR-195.\n\n4.434.\n\nThis legal argument, whereby Chevron was to stand in the shoes of both Texaco and TexPet, was essentially adopted in the Lago Agrio Judgment: see the \"merger\" issue in Part V below.\n\n4.435.\n\n*19 January 2011: Forensic Evidence* (See Part VI): \"Caso Texaco.doc\" is saved by a user of the Old Computer.

It is distressing that the course of justice was perverted. The LAPs received the zealous representation they wanted, but it is sad that it was not always characterized by honor and honesty as well. It is troubling that, in the words of Jeffrey Shinder [a New York attorney retained by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs], what happened here probably means that 'we'll never know whether or not there was a case to be made against Chevron.'*\n\n*But we have come full circle. As the Court wrote at the outset, '[t]he issue in this case is not what happened in the Oriente more than twenty years ago and who, if anyone, now is responsible for any wrongs then done. The issue here, instead, is whether a court decision was procured by corrupt means, regardless of whether the cause was just.'*\n\n*The decision in the Lago Agrio case was obtained by corrupt means.

The US Supreme Court denies *certioriari* on 29 June 2017).\n\n4.487.\n\n*13 July 2016:* By letter with attachments dated 21 July 2016, the Respondent informs the Tribunal as follows:\n\n*\"By letter dated 13 July 2016 [a copy of which was attached, with an English translation] the State's prosecutor [the Fiscal\u00eda General del Estado, or \"FGE\"] ordered the Attorney General's Office to produce within 15 days certified copies of any testimony given by Mr Steven Donziger that is part of the record of these arbitral proceedings. The letter notes that the Office of the Prosecutor opened this preliminary investigation, Case No. 235-2010, in response to a 7 June 2010 letter from Thomas F. Cullen, counsel for Chevron Corporation. The investigation, which is now in its sixth year but obviously active, includes 'three boxes of documents' furnished to Prosecutor by Chevron. According to Claimants, this is the criminal investigation requested by Chevron into the alleged 'extensive evidence of wholesale corruption in the court process.' See Claimants' Suppl. Track II Memorial \u00b6 37.*431\n\n*As we have advised previously, criminal investigations are governed by rules of secrecy. The Office of the Attorney General does not know the subjects or the direction of the investigation. However, under Ecuadorian law, Chevron - as the complaining party - at all times had access to the investigatory developments and either knew or should have known of the pendency of the investigation and the Prosecutor's decision to consider the documents furnished by Chevron.\"*\n\nThe Claimants' pleading reads: *\"\u2026it was Ecuador and its courts that did nothing to stop or correct the fraud, despite the extensive evidence of wholesale corruption in the court process. The Lago Agrio Court denied every motion filed by Chevron that brought the Cabrera's misconduct and the fraud to the Court's attention. Neither the Lago Agrio Court nor any other authority in Ecuador did anything to sanction the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or their representatives, or the judges in the Lago Agrio Litigation, with respect to the Cabrera fraud. Instead, those State authorities ignored Chevron's complaints and the uncontradicted evidence exposing that corruption. This failure to take legal action against those involved in the Cabrera fraud constitutes ratification of those actions by the State.\"*\n\n4.488.\n\nAs the FGE letter makes clear, this preliminary investigation \"for the suspected crime of forging public documents\" followed the report made by Mr Cullen (of Chevron) on 7 June 2010 to the \" Fiscal\u00eda Provincial de Sucumb\u00edos.\" The investigation is said to include a written report dated 31 July 2014 consisting of 14,791 pages made by the \"Fiscal\" of the Province of Sucumb\u00edos to the FGE.\n\n4.489.\n\n*19 March 2018:* By letter (with attachments) dated 19 March 2018, the Claimants inform the Tribunal about the status of the criminal investigations against the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives (footnotes here omitted):\n\n*\"Beginning in August 2009, Chevron has sent a series of letters to Ecuador's Prosecutor General and local prosecutors, summarizing the evidence of the LAPs' misconduct, attaching the evidence, and requesting criminal investigations. In response, three preliminary investigations were opened: (a) the Prosecutor General opened a preliminary investigation in September 2009 into an alleged bribery solicitation scheme involving former Judge Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was then presiding over the Lago Agrio case pending in the Sucumb\u00edos Provincial Court, and other third parties; (b) the Sucumb\u00edos Provincial Prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in April 2010 into the alleged crime of falsification of documents committed by the LAPs' representatives; and (c) the Sucumb\u00edos Provincial Prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in July 2010 into the alleged crime of perjury committed by Richard Cabrera and others.*\n\n*The first preliminary investigation focused on an alleged bribery solicitation scheme in which then Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez and the other participants were recorded on video discussing the payment of a bribe in exchange for the issuance of a multibillion dollar judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case. Despite the unrefuted evidence provided by Chevron, Ecuador's Prosecutor General not only rejected Chevron's complaints and refused to bring charges against Judge N\u00fa\u00f1ez or others, but accused Chevron's counsel of being \"malicious and reckless\" in filing the complaint and having caused \"damage to Ecuador's national image.\" At the Prosecutor's request and over Chevron's objections, the National Court of Justice closed the investigation on September 30, 2013, and found that Chevron's counsel's letter \u2013 which had prompted the investigation \u2013 was reckless and malicious.*\n\n*The second and third preliminary investigations focus on the LAPs' ghostwriting of the Cabrera report and supplemental report and their ghostwriting of official communications filed by Cabrera, while the third preliminary investigation also focuses on the LAPs' falsification of the Calmbacher report and their ghostwriting of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Over the years, the Sucumb\u00edos Provincial Prosecutor has received from Chevron several formal submissions in these investigations detailing the overwhelming evidence of misconduct and fraud. Yet to this day, these investigations remain pending, and the Prosecutor has not brought formal charges against anyone concerning these investigations.\"*\n\n4.490.\n\n*20 April 2018:* By letter (with attachments) dated 20 April 2018, the Respondent provides the following update on the status of the Criminal Investigations in Ecuador:\n\n*\"The Office of the Procurador (the Attorney General with respect to civil matters) received a request for documents and transcripts in its possession relating to the testimony of Steven Donziger, a request with which the Procurador has complied. The caption of the correspondence, and the nature of the request, plainly indicate that, at least at the time of that request (see Respondent's Letter to the Tribunal dated 21 July 2016), there was an active and ongoing investigation into Chevron's allegations that Mr Donziger and others acted unlawfully in respect to the Lago Agrio court proceedings. The Office of the Procurador is unaware if that matter has been closed, that is, it is unaware of any court order granting an application to close the matter. We thus have every reason to believe that the investigation remains open and active. As the complaining party, Chevron would, in the regular course, be apprised of any decision to charge any persons of a crime arising out of that investigation, or alternatively, upon the closure of the investigation.*\n\n*Like the investigation of Mr Donziger and his associates, the investigation of Mr Guerra - consistent with the rules governing criminal investigations - is not a public investigation. Like any other criminal investigation, the subject of that investigation, here, Mr Guerra, would be apprised of any decision to charge him (or any person) of a crime arising out of that investigation, or alternatively, upon the closure of the investigation. Claimants have reported that the Prosecutor has filed a motion to close the case. Ecuador has no information contrary to Chevron's representation. We note that a motion to close the case - while available to Chevron's client, Mr Guerra - is not available to the Republic's civil attorneys and is not a public document. If and when granted, however, the Court's order will be public and the matter closed.\"*\n\n4.491.\n\nAs at the date of this Award, whilst criminal investigations may be continuing in a confidential manner, there is no material before the Tribunal as to its further progress, scope or end-result. In the meantime, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are still seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment outside Ecuador, as summarised above and, probably, elsewhere as envisaged by the \"Invictus\" Memorandum (see above).\n\n4.492.\n\n*27 June 2018:* The Constitutional Court issues its Judgment on 27 June 2018, affirming the Judgment of the Cassation (National) Court (2013), following public hearings held on 16 July 2015 and 22 May 2018. The Constitutional Court declares that there is no violation of constitutional law, as alleged by Chevron; the Court rejects the extraordinary action of protection made by Chevron; and it orders its judgment \"[t]o be recorded, published and enforced.\"432\n\nC-2551.\n\n4.493.\n\nThe Tribunal turns, in the next Part V of this Award, to the Lago Agrio Court Judgment, the Lago Agrio Appellate Judgment, the Cassation Court Judgment and the Judgment of the Constitutional Court, followed by its Conclusions in regard to the principal factual and other matters addressed in both Parts IV and V of this Award.\n\n***PART V*** - ***THE LAGO AGRIO, APPELLATE, CASSATION AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUDGMENTS***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nIn this Part V, the Tribunal addresses the factual and non-forensic issues relating to the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011, the judgment of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court of 3 January 2012, the judgment of the Cassation Court of 12 November 2013 and the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 27 June 2018.\n\n***B: The Lago Agrio Judgment (2011)***\n---------------------------------------\n\n5.2.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, as indicated above, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Zambrano) issues the Lago Agrio Judgment.1 The Lago Agrio Judgment is later clarified by the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Zambrano) by a Clarification Order on 4 March 2011.2 It awards US$ 18.2 billion in damages to be paid by Chevron, including US$ 8.6 billion as punitive damages subject to a timely public apology by Chevron, with a 10% award to the ADF.\n\nC-931.\n\nC-1367; R-1193.\n\n5.3.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment extends to about 88,000 words and 188 pages, typed in single spacing in unbroken text, with no line or paragraph numbering, page breaks or table of contents. It is divided into 15 Parts, with many internal sub-sections. Part 1 on \"Competence\" or jurisdiction (p.4), Part 2 on the form of Lago Agrio Litigation (p.6), Part 3 on Chevron's defences (p.6), Part 4 on the Parties' motions (p.35), Part 5 on due process (p.60), Part 6 on Ecuadorian environmental legislation (p.60), Part 7 on the basis of civil liability (p.74), Part 8 on the nature of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims, including Article 43 of the EMA (p.90), Part 9 on the material facts (p.92), Part 10 on causation (p.154), Part 11 on \"fault\" (p.175), Part 12 on the 1995 Settlement Agreement (p.175), Part 13 on measures of redress for the harm (p.176), Part 14 on Chevron's \"bad faith\" and punitive damages (p.184), and Part 15 on the establishment of a commercial trust as the beneficiary of compensation (p.186).\n\n5.4.\n\nAt least at first sight, particularly to a non-lawyer unfamiliar with the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Lago Agrio Judgment appears to be a lengthy, detailed, reasoned and powerful decision.\n\n5.5.\n\nAs to non-punitive damages, the Lago Agrio Judgment awards: (i) US$ 5,396,160,000 to \"recover the natural condition of the soil impacted by TexPet's activities\";3 (ii) US$ 1.4 billion for a \"health improvement plan\" to \"cover the health needs created by the public health problem occasioned by the acts of the defendant [sic: Chevron]\";4 (iii) US$ 100 million for a \"community reconstruction and ethnic reaffirmation program\" to redress \"cultural harm\";5 (iv) US$ 150 million for the construction of \"a potable water system or systems\" to \"benefit the persons who inhabit the area that was operated by the defendant [sic: Chevron]\";6 (v) US$ 800 million for \"a plan of health which shall necessarily include treatment for the persons who suffer from cancer that can be attributed to TexPet's operation in the Concession\" (not being the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs);7 (vi) US$ 200 million \"to recover the native flora, fauna, and the aquatic life of the zone\";8 and (vii) US$ 600 million for \"the cleanup of groundwater\".9\n\nC-931, p. 181.\n\nC-931, p. 183.\n\nC-931, p. 183.\n\nC-931, pp. 182-183.\n\nC-931, p. 184.\n\nC-931, p. 182.\n\nC-931, p. 179.\n\n5.6.\n\nAs to the \"trust\" as the beneficiary of compensation, the Lago Agrio Judgment envisages a \"commercial trust, to be administered by one of the fund [i.e. the ADF] and trust administrator companies located in Ecuador.\"10 The beneficiary of the trust \"shall be the Amazon Defense Front or the person or persons it designates, considering that 'those affected' by the environmental harm are undetermined \u2026\". The \"representatives of the Defense Front, or those they designate on behalf of the affected persons, will constitute the board of the trust \u2026\". Thus, the proceeds of the Lago Agrio Judgment were to be controlled by the ADF and not, at least directly, by the individuals comprising the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.\n\nC-931, pp. 186-187.\n\n5.7.\n\nIn addition, Chevron was ordered \"to satisfy an additional 10% of the amount ordered as reparation of harm in [the] name of the Amazon Defense Front, with costs.11 Apart from costs, this \"reparation\" appears to represent a payment due from Chevron of either US$ 1.82 billion or US$ 864 million to the ADF.\n\nC-931, pp. 187-188.\n\n5.8.\n\nThe actual drafting of the Lago Agrio Judgment is, inevitably, the subject of a wideranging controversy between the Parties. The forensic expert issues are considered in the next Part VI of this Award. For the time being, the Tribunal confines itself to factual and other non-forensic expert issues below, in this Part V.\n\n5.9.\n\nDr Zambrano testified in the RICO Litigation that he started drafting the Judgment in mid-November 2010, after the Lago Agrio Court had purchased the \"New Computer\" for his use.\n\n5.10.\n\nDr Zambrano also testified that he prepared the Judgment all by himself (with the assistance of his student secretary, Ms \"C\")12 between mid-November 2010 and 14 February 2011, a period of three months when he also had to attend to other unrelated cases pending before him in the Lago Agrio Court. He also testified, more than once, that he had prepared the whole of the Judgment on the New Computer because it was \"the more modern computer.\"13 In fact, based on objective evidence, his use of the New Computer could not have begun before 26 November 2010.14\n\nThe identity of Ms \"C\" is known to the Parties and the Tribunal. As explained in the Selected Dramatis Personae in this Award, the Tribunal thinks it unnecessary to give her full name in this Award.\n\nC-1979, p. 196.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 9.\n\n5.11.\n\nIf Dr Zambrano is correct, he drafted the Lago Agrio Judgment in a period of less than three months, or 81 consecutive days (i.e. 26 November 2010 to 14 February 2011), based on a court file of some 237,000 pages that included more than 100 expert reports and many legal submissions. Given his other work on unrelated court cases, whilst not absolutely impossible, this achievement within such a short time seems inherently unlikely.\n\n5.12.\n\nDuring this period, Judge Zambrano gave several interviews to the press. In the report published by *Reuters* on 31 January 2011,15 Judge Zambrano is described as follows:\n\n*\"\u2026 The chairs and sofa in Zambrano's office are littered with 100-page makeshift notebooks full of evidence, each packet held together with white string. 'There's barely any place left to sit,' Zambrano joked with Reuters during a recent visit to his chambers in Lago Agrio, a hardscrabble Amazon town near the Colombian border. 'I have about 500 notebooks to go,' he said, holding his battered reading glasses in his hand and smiling. 'Not much.' He has already gone through 1,500 of the packets and is widely expected to issue his verdict later this year, although he declined to comment on the possible timing of his ruling \u2026\"*\n\nIt is impossible for the Tribunal to accept these statements literally.\n\nC-919.\n\n5.13.\n\nEach of these \"notebooks\" or \"packets\" (i.e. *cuerpos*) contain some 100 pages, so that 1,500 *cuerpos*, as reported, would correspond to some 150,000 pages.16 With 500 *cuerpos* \"to go\", it would mean that Judge Zambrano had still to study 50,000 pages in the 14 or so days remaining before the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued on 14 February 2011, an average of about 3,500 pages daily without allowing any time for drafting the Judgment or other unrelated judicial work. As for the 150,000 pages already studied before 31 January 2011, that would mean an average of about 2,230 pages daily (from 26 November 2010, running consecutively), again without allowing any time for drafting the Judgment, other unrelated judicial work or non-working days.\n\nIn Judge Zambrano's interview with *Expreso* on 18 December 2010, there is a reference to \"*2,122 cuerpos*\", corresponding to about 212,200 pages (C-896, p. 1).\n\n5.14.\n\nEven allowing for the facts that not every page in every *cuerpo* might require Judge Zambrano's consideration, that he might be a better than average speed-reader of technical documentation and that he might be a superlatively efficient judicial draftsman, there still arise troubling questions as to the feasibility of his preparing, alone, the Lago Agrio Court Judgment from the court file in the time and manner described by him.\n\n5.15.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the expert report of Professor Keith Rayner, a cognitive psychologist and specialist in the scientific study of reading, adduced by the Claimants.17 He concluded that: \"given the limitations on human readers processing capabilities (both in terms of acuity limitations and attention limitations), reading rate with good comprehension is limited to 300-400 wpm\". Thus, so the Tribunal calculates, if the 2,000 or so *cuerpos* (corresponding to 200,000 pages) averaged 300 words a page (as Professor Rayner calculated), Judge Zambrano would have needed, with a reading rate of 300 words per minute, at least 138 consecutive 24-hour working days to study the court file. On the account given by Judge Zambrano, he did not have the time to achieve this.\n\nSee C-1036.\n\n5.16.\n\nAs to research into foreign laws, Dr Zambrano (who does not speak English) testified that his temporary student secretary (Ms \"C\") undertook legal research on the Internet and found the cases from America, Australia and England cited in the Lago Agrio Judgment, using Internet services for translation into Spanish.18 As explained below, there arise troubling questions as to such foreign legal research, as described by him.\n\nC-1980, p. 1620.\n\n5.17.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as also explained later below, the circumstantial and other evidence, including testimony by Dr Zambrano in the RICO Litigation, does not support Dr Zambrano's account of writing the Lago Agrio Judgment. Conversely, as explained below, it supports the Claimants' case that the Lago Agrio Judgment was not prepared by Judge Zambrano, but, at least in material part, that it was 'ghostwritten' by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives with Judge Zambrano's corrupt connivance.\n\n***C: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 The \"Merger\" between Texaco and Chevron***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.18.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment contains a lengthy passage addressing the issue of the \"merger\" (\"fusi\u00f3n\" in Spanish) between Texaco and Chevron, resulting in Chevron standing in the shoes of both Texaco and (as Texaco's \"fourth level subsidiary\") TexPet. It is best cited at length from pp. 6-26 of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as set out below (with added line references for ease of reference) in Annex 7 to this Part V.19 It proceeds on the basis that Chevron is the sole defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation; it accepts that Texaco \"is not a party in this lawsuit\" (Line 204); and it assumes that TexPet also is not a co-defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\nC-931, Part 3.1, pp. 6-26.\n\n5.19.\n\nIn brief, the Lago Agrio Judgment lifts the \"corporate veils\" between Chevron, Texaco and TexPet, so that Chevron bears the obligations and liabilities of both Texaco and TexPet. It invokes, in numerous passages, the principle of good faith under Ecuadorian law (Lines 163, 174, 221, 293, 310, 332 and 446). It notes: \"It is appropriate to recall that in our legal system the principle prevails that that no one can benefit from his bad faith\" (Lines 221-222). In support, it refers to foreign legal materials, including court judgments and laws of the state of Delaware, the USA and North America (Lines 251, 309, 312, 314 and 329).\n\n5.20.\n\nAs regards the \"merger\" between Chevron and Texaco, it attributes \"serious doubts as to the good faith with [sic: which] the defendant [Chevron] acted in this lawsuit\" (Lines 332-333). It decides: \"The law serves justice, and cannot allow legal institutions to be manipulated for illegitimate purposes, such as to favour a fraud or to promote injustice, which would be the case of transferring the assets to one corporation 'free of responsibility', while the responsibilities are kept in a company 'free of assets', the way the defendant tries to have us understand the transaction that took place between Chevron and Texaco, in which the new company benefits from the combined companies, but fails to mention the obligations.\" (Lines 237-243).\n\n5.21.\n\nAs to the undertaking made by Texaco as a condition of the stay of proceedings in the Aguinda Litigation, it decides: \"In this way the obligation to submit to Ecuadorian justice pending on Texaco Inc. was also transmitted to new company Chevron Texaco Corporation, so that consequently Chevron Corp. cannot allege that it never operated in Ecuador to give grounds for lack of a legitimate opposing party\" (Lines 299-302). It concludes: \"It is appropriate, for the purposes of justice, to impose on Chevron Corp., which benefits from the 'merger', the obligations of Texaco Inc.\" (Lines 325-327).\n\n5.22.\n\nAs regards TexPet, it accepts the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Complaint that: \"In reality, Texpet was nothing more than a screen behind which Texaco Inc. acted\u2026\" (Lines 339340). It finds: \"In this case, it has been proven that in reality TexPet and Texaco Inc. functioned in Ecuador as a single and inseparable operation.\" (Lines 627-628). It concludes: \"\u2026 considering the foregoing analysis, the exceptional but justified need has been established in this case to lift any corporate veil that separates [Texaco from TexPet] given that it has been proven that it [TexPet] was a company with a capital very inferior to the volume of its operations, that required constant authorizations and investments from the parent company [Texaco] to carry out the normal course of business of its commercial activity, that the executives were the same in both companies, and principally the obvious fact that not lifting the corporate veil would imply a 'manifest injustice'.\" (Lines 664-671).\n\n5.23.\n\nThe Tribunal returns to the legal consequences of this analysis below in Part VII, on the issue of jurisdiction under the Treaty.\n\n***D: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 \"Unfiled Materials\"***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.24.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Lago Agrio Judgment incorporates (without attribution) eight sets of material which were never actually filed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs during the Lago Agrio Litigation, and were thus never seen by the Claimants during that Litigation. The Claimants allege that these materials were corruptly used by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, with Judge Zambrano's connivance, in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.25.\n\nThese eight materials are: (1) the Clapp Report;20 (2) the Draft Alegato;21 (3) the Erion Memorandum;22 (4) the Fajardo Trust Email;23 (5) the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum;24 (6) the January and June Index Summaries;25 (7) the Moodie Memorandum;26 and (8) the Selva Viva Database.27\n\nC-2423.\n\nC-1565.\n\nC-2416.\n\nC-997.\n\nC-2118.\n\nSee C-1800 (January); C-2315 (June).\n\nC-1645; R-1018.\n\nC-2316.\n\n5.26.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that three of these materials were used in the Lago Agrio Judgment: (1) the Clapp Report, (5) the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum and (8) the Selva Viva Database.28\n\nTrack II Hearing D1.32, 70 & 328.\n\n5.27.\n\nThere is, however an important preliminary issue as to whether any of these \"unfiled\" materials were in fact unfiled with the Lago Agrio Court. The files of the Lago Agrio Litigation held (on paper) by the Lago Agrio Court comprised approximately 217,000 pages of documentation.\n\n5.28.\n\nThe Claimants contend that under Ecuadorian law, as Dr Santiago Vel\u00e1zquez Coello testified, every document added to the court record of the Lago Agrio Litigation was required to be acknowledged by a court order, hand-numbered by the Court's clerk and invariably sewn into a \"cuerpo\", each of which consisted of 100 pages of documentation. Further, under no circumstances may an Ecuadorian judge base his judgment on a document not so included in the court record.29\n\nVel\u00e1zquez ER 1, pp. 3-5.\n\n5.29.\n\nAs already indicated, the Respondent does not dispute the use of certain of these materials in the Lago Agrio Judgment; but it disputes that any of them were not filed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs with the Lago Agrio Court.30 The Respondent contends that the Lago Agrio Court could have maintained its records improperly or that these materials had been presented to the Court in person or informally by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives during one or more of the judicial inspections (attended by Chevron's representatives). The Respondent concludes that, in these circumstances, it is quite impossible for any person to know the universe of the documents submitted to the Lago Agrio Court.31 The Respondent does not, however, seek to defend the use by an Ecuadorian Court of evidential materials not openly submitted by the disputing parties to an Ecuadorian court, formally or informally.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,328.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,326.\n\n5.30.\n\nThe Claimants adduced expert testimony from Dr Patrick Juola and Mr Samuel Hernandez. These experts conducted different forms of review of the Lago Agrio Court's record. These reviews included both OCR and hand-review. As to the latter, Dr Juola testified that about 100,000 pages of the record were hand-reviewed.32 In their expert testimonies, both Dr Juola and Mr Hernandez confirmed that none of these eight materials are to be found in the court record. As to the Respondent's allegation that these materials were submitted informally, the unfiled documents were not found amongst the papers of Chevron's lawyers (who attended the judicial inspections), which (according to these experts) discounts this 'informal' explanation. The Tribunal accepts this expert evidence.\n\nTrack II Hearing D2,503.\n\n5.31.\n\nThere is a third explanation provided by Judge Zambrano himself. In his Declaration in the RICO Litigation in the USA, Dr Zambrano testified how the content of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' \"unfiled documents\" appeared in the Lago Agrio Judgment:\n\n*\"[O]ccasionally documents related to the case that were not incorporated into the process were left at the door to my office at the Court.... I verified all of that information regarding the case, that is to say, I made sure that it was not false information and also that the basis for such information is in the record. This was relevant information that, as I read it, I realized it could be of use in my decision.\"33*\n\nC-1981, para 16.\n\n5.32.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this third explanation required the \"basis\" for such additional documentary information to have been \"in the record\" of the Lago Agrio Court. Such information could not, therefore be entirely new, unfiled information. The eight materials at issue were new information. Accordingly, in the Tribunal's view, this third explanation must be discounted. The Tribunal also notes that the Lago Agrio Judgment itself states: \"\u2026 the Presidency should only consider the elements that form part of the proceeding \u2026\". (see Annex 7 to this Part V below, Lines 41-42).\n\n5.33.\n\nWhilst it is near-impossible to prove conclusively a negative, the Tribunal accepts, as the overwhelmingly probable explanation, that none of these eight materials had been filed with the Lago Agrio Court; that all were 'new' documents (without \"a basis \u2026 in the record\"); and that none were disclosed to or known by Chevron in the Lago Agrio Litigation, whether formally or informally. It is significant that all these materials favour the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, not Chevron. It is also significant that the Respondent has not advanced any cogent explanation to this Tribunal, from any factual or expert witness, as to why these eight materials cannot be found in the record held by the Lago Agrio Court. It is also significant that the Respondent has not produced any of the disputed documents from the court record. At this point, the evidential burden of proof shifted to the Respondent. It was not discharged by the Respondent.\n\n5.34.\n\nAs explained below, the Tribunal finds, based on the evidence as a whole, that the contents of these unfiled materials were used by certain of the Lago Agrio representatives for the purpose of 'ghostwriting' the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.35.\n\n*(1) The Clapp Report* : In brief, this document is a 37 page report of November 2006, drafted in Spanish by Dr Richard W. Clapp and others, as experts to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.34 The report addresses the health impacts of TexPet's exploitation of the concession, concluding (inter alia) that soil and water samples indicated an excess of lead in the former Concession Area.\n\nC-2423; R-1012.\n\n5.36.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the Clapp Report was used in the Lago Agrio Judgment. There is no evidence showing that this document was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court.\n\n5.37.\n\nParts of the Clapp Report (not already covertly used by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in Annex K to the Cabrera Report) appear in Part 9 of the Lago Agrio Judgment in regard to contamination.35 There is no evidence that these parts of the Clapp Report were submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court. No such documentation can be found in the record of the Lago Agrio Court. The Respondent speculates that this unfiled documentation was informally submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives at a judicial inspection in April 2007. At that time, the judge of the Lago Agrio Court was Judge Y\u00e1nez (not Judge Zambrano). There is no evidence to support such speculation; and the Tribunal does not accept it.\n\nC-931, Part 9, pp. 109-110.\n\n5.38.\n\nDr Leonard testified as to verbatim strings of words copied from the unfiled parts of the Clapp Report into the Lago Agrio Judgment, such as the latter's conclusion that oil and water samples indicated an excess of lead creating a real risk of lead poisoning.36 That is self-evident from a comparison between page 7 of the Clapp Report and pages 109 to 110 of the Lago Agrio Judgment (in the original Spanish version): see Dr Leonard's Example 11 of his second expert report, reproduced below in Annex 8(1) to this Part V.\n\nLeonard ER 2, Example 11, p. 34.\n\n5.39.\n\nThese are also evident from Dr Leonard's Exhibit 5 in his second expert report, reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V (pp. 116-117). It is a copy of the Lago Agrio Judgment highlighted to show strings of text and symbols which were copied from the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' unfiled materials: for the Clapp Report (original pp. 109-110).\n\n5.40.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Clapp Report were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.41.\n\n*(2) The Draft Alegato:* In brief, this document is a draft Alegato (\"argument\") of 11 November 2010, drafted in Spanish ostensibly for submission to the Lago Agrio Court.37 It is a different document from the Alegatos actually filed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs with the Lago Agrio Court on 23 December 2010, 17 January 2011 and 1 February 2011.\n\nC-1565.\n\n5.42.\n\nThere is no evidence that this draft Alegato was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n5.43.\n\nIn his expert testimony, Dr Leonard identified in the Lago Agrio Judgment several strings of texts and symbols in the unfiled draft Alegato that were not present in the filed Alegatos:38 see his Example 14 in his second expert report comparing the unfiled draft Alegato (page 61) with the Lago Agrio Judgment (page 24) and the filed Final Alegato (page 99), reproduced in Annex 8(2) below.\n\nLeonard ER 1, Exhibits A & C; Leonard ER 2, Exhibits 5 & 7.\n\n5.44.\n\nThese are also evident from Dr Leonard's Exhibit 5 in his second expert report, reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the unfiled Draft Alegato, see pp. 23-24 (original pp. 93-94).\n\n5.45.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Draft Alegato were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.46.\n\n*(3) The Erion Memorandum:* In brief, this document of 18 August 2008, attached to an email from Mr Erion to Mr Donziger of 11 November 2009, is a six-page research note, written in English by Mr Graham Erion, a US lawyer working as an intern with the Lago Agrio Plaintiff's legal representatives.39 It addresses Chevron's case that it was not a proper defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation because (inter alia) the \"reverse triangular merger\" between Chevron and Texaco maintained Texaco's separate corporate identity. The author analyses the factual materials and the principles of Delaware and other US laws on merger and on piercing the corporate veil by the Delaware Courts, as regards Texaco, TexPet and Chevron.\n\nC-2416. (The Tribunal has seen no evidence connecting Mr Erion personally with any improper conduct alleged by the Claimants against the Lago Agrio Plaintiff's representatives).\n\n5.47.\n\nThere is no evidence showing that this document was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court.\n\n5.48.\n\nIt is evident that parts of the Erion Memorandum are reproduced (in Spanish) in the draft judgment of 21 December 2010 (the \"21/12 Providencias\") on Judge Zambrano's Old Computer, including the citation to four US judgments from New Jersey and Oklahoma: see page 3 of the Erion Memorandum and page 16 of the 21/12 Providencias. Without citing the names of these US cases, the Lago Agrio Judgment refers to their principles on substance (over form), manifest injustice and patent injustice decided \"by the Courts of the US\" (pages 15- 16).\n\n5.49.\n\nIn his expert testimony, Dr Leonard identified the use of the Erion Memorandum in the Lago Agrio Judgment: see the example comparing the Erion Memorandum (page 5), the \"21/12 Providencias\" (page 14) and the Lago Agrio Judgment (page 13), reproduced in Annex 8(3) below.\n\n5.50.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Erion Memorandum were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.51.\n\n*(4) The Fajardo Trust Email:* In brief, this document is a 1\u00bd page email sent by Mr Fajardo to Messrs Prieto, Saenz and Donziger on 18 June 2009.40 As explained in Part IV above, it also sets out an unidentified extract of text in Spanish from the decision of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court in *Andrade v Conelec* (No. 168-2007, of 11 April 2007), relating to the establishment of a trust to hold an award of damages made by a court.\n\nC-997; C-1216.\n\n5.52.\n\nThere is no evidence showing that any part of this document was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n5.53.\n\nAs Dr Leonard testified, the email contains errors, misquotations, miscitations and strings of words that are to be found, verbatim, in the Lago Agrio Judgment but not in the official report of the *Andrade* judgment.41 That is evident from a comparison between the first page of the email and page 186 of the Lago Agrio Judgment: see Annex 8(4) below, reproducing Dr Leonard's Example 9 from his second expert report.\n\nLeonard ER 2, Example 10, p. 32.\n\n5.54.\n\nThese are also evident from Dr Leonard's Exhibit 5 in his second expert report, reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the unfiled Fajardo Trust Email, see page 110 (original p 186).\n\n5.55.\n\nThe Respondent's explanation for this coincidence is that both Mr Fajardo and Judge Zambrano were coincidentally working from an unofficial version of the Supreme Court's judgment, even where, in the same Lago Agrio Judgment, Judge Zambrano cites the official version of that Supreme Court judgment. The Respondent's explanation is speculation unsupported by any cogent evidence. It is not accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n5.56.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Fajardo Trust Email were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.57.\n\n*(5) The Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum:* In brief, this document is a 20-page memorandum in the Spanish language that appears to have been drafted on or shortly before 15 November 2007. It was sent by email dated 15 November 2007 from Mr S\u00e1enz to (inter alios) Messrs Donziger, Ponce and Prieto.42 The memorandum (inter alia) describes: (i) the factual nature of the relationship between Texaco Inc and Texpet; and (ii) the nature of the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron.\n\nC-2118.\n\n5.58.\n\nAs Dr Leonard testified, substantial parts of the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum appear verbatim in the Lago Agrio Judgment.43 The Judgment shares the same identical or near-identical strings of more than 90 words; the same idiosyncratic use of shorthand references; and out-of-order numerical ordering. That is evident from pages 20, 21 and 24 of the Lago Agrio Judgment: see Annex 8(5) below, reproducing Example 1 to Dr Leonard's second expert report (comparing page 8 of the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum and page 24 of the Lago Agrio Judgment). It is also evident (as regards out-of-order numbering) at page 5 of the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum and page 21 of the Lago Agrio Judgment (re \"6964\")\"44 see also Annex 8(5) below.\n\nLeonard ER 2, pp. 14-18.\n\nLeonard ER 2, p. 18.\n\n5.59.\n\nIt is also evident from Dr Leonard's Exhibit 5 in his second expert report, reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum, see pages 90-92 and 94-95 (original pp. 20, 21, 22, 24 & 25).\n\n5.60.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum was used in the Lago Agrio Judgment. It contends, however, that its subject-matter, i.e. the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron, was debated between the parties during the judicial inspection on 12 June 2008.45\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,329.\n\n5.61.\n\nAt that time, the Lago Agrio Litigation was assigned to Judge Novillo (not Judge Zambrano). No evidence supporting the document's use exists in any of the email messages passing between the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' representatives at the time of this judicial inspection, where the documents to be submitted to the Lago Agrio Court were being considered by them, including documentation on \"fusi\u00f3n\". In none of these messages dated 9 June 2008, passing between Mr Donziger, Mr S\u00e1enz and Mr Erion is the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum listed amongst those documents.46 Further, the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum does not appear in the Lago Agrio Court's formal protocol and acta recording documentation submitted by the parties during this judicial inspection.47\n\nC-1638; C-1639 & C-1640.\n\nR-530; R-660.\n\n5.62.\n\nIf the Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum was nonetheless then informally submitted to the Lago Court by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and unrecorded, it is significant that no witness from the Lago Agrio Court was called by the Respondent to support the suggestion made by the Respondent. In the circumstances, that suggestion remains unproven speculation. It is not accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n5.63.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.64.\n\n*(6) The January and June Index Summaries:* In brief, these materials in the form of Excel spreadsheets, of 39 pages and 191 pages respectively, comprise tables identifying documents filed in the court record of the Lago Agrio Litigation, prepared internally by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in January 2007 and June 2007 respectively.48\n\nC-1800 (January); C-2315 (June).\n\n5.65.\n\nThere is no evidence that these Index Summaries were submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Neither can be found in the record of the Lago Agrio Court in any form.\n\n5.66.\n\nIn his expert testimony, Dr Leonard testified that he found multiple examples of identical errors, identical or near-identical words strings and incorrect citations in these Index Summaries that were repeated in the Lago Agrio Judgment.49 For example, the court record refers to \"75003\" whereas both the June Index Summary and the Lago Agrio Judgment (at pp. 142 and 150) refer mistakenly to \"75013\".50 Annex 8(6) below reproduces Example 7 from Dr Leonard's second expert report, comparing identical or near-identical word strings in the unfiled Index Summaries and the Lago Agrio Judgment with the filed record.\n\nLeonard ER 2, pp. 22-30 & Exhibit 4, pp. 10-20.\n\nLeonard ER 2, p. 29.\n\n5.67.\n\nThese are also evident from Dr Leonard's Exhibit 5 in his second expert report, reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the Index Summaries, see pages 88-89, 96-97, and 100-109 (original pp. 6, 7, 100, 101, 114, 127, 128, 129, 133, 137, 138, 142, 146 & 150).\n\n5.68.\n\nIn his testimony at the RICO trial in New York, Dr Zambrano admitted that he did not know what an Excel spreadsheet was.51 The actual use, or non-use, of Excel on the Zambrano Computers is considered in Part VI below. These evidential materials confirm that Dr Zambrano did not himself use the January and June Index Summaries, notwithstanding their use in the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nC-1979, p. 278.\n\n5.69.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled January and June Index Summaries were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.70.\n\n*(7) The Moodie Memorandum:* In brief, this document is a 13-page memorandum in English, headed \"The standard of proof in US common-law toxic tort negligence claims.\"52 It was sent by Mr Nicholas Moodie, an Australian legal intern working with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, to Mr Prieto and Mr Saenz on 2 February 2009.53 In this memorandum, Mr Moodie analyses Californian and Australian case law regarding causation and burden of proof in medical tort cases and considers how the tests identified in such case law might be applied to Chevron in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\nC-1645.\n\nC-1645, p. 1. (The Tribunal has seen no evidence connecting Mr Moodie personally with any improper conduct alleged by the Claimants against the Lago Agrio Plaintiff's representatives).\n\n5.71.\n\nThe Moodie Memorandum's particular use of the \"substantial factor\" test for causation in asbestos cases under Californian law is repeated in parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment (pp. 89-90). Annex 8(7) below reproduces these passages.\n\n5.72.\n\nAs Professor Michael Green testified, this \"substantial factor\" test and other features taken from Californian law make it at least highly unlikely that the passages in the Lago Agrio Judgment were prepared independently of the Moodie Memorandum.54\n\nC-1646, paras 19-20.\n\n5.73.\n\nAs to the Moodie Memorandum's use of Australian law, Mr James Spigelman AC QC (formerly the Chief Justice of New South Wales) testified that the Memorandum's particular descriptions of Australian case law were inapposite as a matter of Australian law; yet the same inapposite factors were used in the Lago Agrio Judgment, using identical language (allowing for translation).55\n\nC-1647, paras 8-21.\n\n5.74.\n\nProfessor Green also referred to the idiosyncratic use of two common law jurisdictions for the purpose of applying principles of Ecuadorian law, a civil law system, in the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.75.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Moodie Memorandum were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.76.\n\n*(8) The Selva Viva Database:* In brief, the compilation of this electronic database56 was substantially completed by Hydrosphere Resource Consultants, a contractor working with E-Tech and Stratus Consulting, both acting as environmental experts for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Hydrosphere was asked to digitise data in electronic from hard copy documentation, principally inspection reports, soil samples and water samples, for use by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' legal representatives. The database was created in about April-June 2007 by Ms Laura Belanger, Mr John Rodgers and several others in Ecuador and Boulder, Colorado. It was delivered to Dr Anne Maest (of Stratus Consulting) and Mr Donziger.57 It was then completed and maintained for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs by Selva Viva, the company controlled by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. It comprises three Excel spreadsheets.\n\nC-2316.\n\nC-1224, pp. 47ff.\n\n5.77.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the Silva Viva Database was used in the Lago Agrio Judgment. There is no evidence showing that this material was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court.\n\n5.78.\n\nThe Respondent's speculation that the database was submitted to the Lago Agrio Court informally during a judicial inspection is unsupported by any evidence. The Tribunal has noted the evidence of Mr Rosero who sought to copy the CDs and DVDs in the record of the Lago Agrio Court and found that 11 of these devices could not be duplicated or read.58 These 11 devices were all submitted to the Lago Agrio Court on behalf of Chevron and not the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. Thus, contrary to the Respondent's submission, these files do not show that Dr Juola's analysis of the court record was incomplete and therefore unreliable.\n\nR-1176; C-2424.\n\n5.79.\n\nThe Claimants allege that there are numerous irregular commonalities between the Selva Viva Database and the Lago Agrio Judgment that are not consistent with any data filed with the Lago Agrio Court. The Claimants allege that these commonalities can only be explained by the copying of the unfiled database into the Judgment, i.e. 'ghostwriting'. Their allegations depend upon the expert evidence summarised below.\n\n5.80.\n\nMr Spencer Lynch (of Stroz Friedberg) is an expert in digital forensics. He was called by the Claimants. In his first expert report, Mr Lynch compared the environmental data at pages 101 \u2013 112 of the Lago Agrio Judgment with the \"Filed Lab Results in the official court record\" and with the \"Unfiled Selva Viva Database\".\n\n5.81.\n\nMr Lynch identified nine categories of naming and data irregularities:59\n\n*\"[i] SV and TX Suffixes \u2013 Many of the sampling results set forth in the Judgment on pages 104 through 112 end with the suffix \"\\_sv\" or \"\\_tx.\" However, a review of the Judicial Inspection Reports and Filed Lab Results provided to me did not identify a single sample result referenced in this manner. In contrast, a review of the data within the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation showed that a majority of the sampling results referenced in the reviewed portion of the Judgment contained these \"\\_sv\" or \"\\_tx\" suffixes. Figures 1 and 2 show examples of data in the Filed Lab Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, respectively. Figure 3 shows a list of sampling results extracted from the Judgment where the names match the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation but do not match any of the Filed Lab Results.*\n\n*[ii] Parentheses Placement \u2013 Further review of the sampling results listed in the Judgment show another naming convention used in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation but not in the Filed Lab Results. Both the Judgment and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation used a naming convention ending with numeric ranges and an \"m\" or \"cm\" enclosed within parentheses. In contrast, the Filed Lab Results in the court record used a naming convention that ended with numeric ranges in parentheses, followed by an \"m\" or \"cm\" outside of the parentheses. Figures 4 and 5 show data for the same inspection location from the Filed Lab Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the affected names across these data sources and the Judgment.*\n\n*[iii] Underscore Separators \u2013 Stroz Friedberg found another naming irregularity in the Judgment that shows its reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. When discussing benzene results on page 108, the Judgment referred to sample result \"SA\\_13\\_JI\\_AM1\\_0.1M.\" This name contained underscores between various parts of the title, and this naming format matches that used in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. In contrast, the Filed Lab Results contained no such underscores. Instead, data for the SA13 sample clearly shows dashes used as separators within the title of the sample result. Figures 7 and 8 show the data for this sample in the Filed Lab Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, respectively.*\n\n*[iv] Incorrectly Identified Expert \u2013 Finally, page 108 of the Judgment stated, \"Chevron's expert, John Connor, submitted results showing 9.9 and 2.3 mg/Kg (see samples JL-LAC-PIT1-SD2-SU1.R (1.30-1.90) M y JI-LAC-PIT1-SD1-SU1-R (1.6-2.4)M) during the judicial inspection in Lago Agrio Central\u2026\" (from translation). The Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation also shows John Connor as the examiner responsible for that test data. However, the Judicial Inspection Report filed with the Court shows Professor Fernando Morales as Chevron's expert for that inspection, not John Connor.*\n\n*[v] Non-Detects \u2013 Based on data that Stroz Friedberg has reviewed in this case, I am aware that some environmental sampling procedures have a detection limit based on the equipment, the methods used in the sampling procedure, and/or the substance being tested. Samples under a detection limit often are referred to as a \"non-detect\" and, when a non-detect is recorded, it often is shown as a less-than sign (\"<\") followed by a number that represents the minimum concentration of a substance that can be detected by the applied test or sampling method. In this case, the Filed Lab Results show that the concentrations of mercury for various inspection sites were recorded as non-detects, and expressed as \"<7.\" The Judgment, however, dropped the \"<\" and failed to acknowledge that the level of mercury fell below detectible levels for several sites. Instead, the Court stated in its decision that \"alarming levels of mercury have been found\" with \"several samples reaching 7mg/Kg\" of mercury.\"*\n\n*The evidence again revealed that the Court likely relied on and subsequently misinterpreted the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, rather than relying on the Filed Lab Results submitted with the Judicial Inspection Reports. The Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation placed the \"<\" in a separate column, as described in the email thread dated March 4, 2008 and found in the SN 049997-SN 050000.pdf. The Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation listed the \"7\" in its own column, and the Court appeared to have misinterpreted this as the actual concentration of mercury for various sites. In doing so, the Judgment eliminated any non-detect results and made mercury levels appear higher and more certain than the actual filed results. The Judgment appears to have made the same mistake with respect to concentrations of benzene and toluene at other sites. Figures 9 and 10 show an example of the Filed Lab Results versus the spreadsheets from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Figure 11 shows a comparison of the non-detects located in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation and the Filed Lab Results relative to how they appear in the Judgment.*\n\n*[vi] Milligram (mg) vs. Microgram (\u03bcg) \u2013 While comparing data points, Stroz Friedberg observed instances where concentrations of substances at specific sites were listed in both the Judgment and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation as milligrams per kilogram (mg/Kg). However, the Filed Lab Results indicate that concentrations for those same substances and sites should have been listed as micrograms per kilogram (\u03bcg/Kg) \u2013 a thousand times less concentrated than the levels reported in the Judgment. Again, the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation appears to be the source of the erroneous information cited. Figures 12 and 13 show examples of the Filed Lab Results and corresponding data from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Figure 14 shows a comparison of the concentrations referenced in the Judgment and data for those sites reflected in the Filed Lab Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, respectively.*\n\n*[vii] Chevron TPH Results \u2013 On page 102 of the Judgment, the author referred to 1,984 TPH test results \"\u2026 brought by the defendants' experts\u2026.\" Based on Stroz Friedberg's review of The Connor Report and Anexo B to the Cabrera Report, this number appears to be too high. Those reports indicate that between 932 and 964 soil samples were taken by Chevron. An examination of the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation confirmed that 1,984 was inaccurate and based on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation and not documents filed with the Court. In short, the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation broke the TPH results down into two parts, and the Judgment appears to have made the mistake of double-counting these test results. Stroz Friedberg found this error when it sorted the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation by the following columns and unique entries: \"Fuente de datos\" (Texaco); \"Matriz\" (Suelo); and \"Parametro\" (\"Begins with\" TPH). This sorting had the effect of limiting results to soil samples attributed to Chevron and analyzed for TPH. When Stroz Friedberg did this sorting, it found that the count of all Chevron's TPH test results in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation equaled the number cited in the Judgment \u2013 1,984. However, the TPH results in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation contained two parts \u2013 one row for Diesel Range Organics (DRO) readings and one row for Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) readings (See Figure 15).*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The Judgment stated that DRO and GRO readings \"have to be added up to in order to have a relatively comparable equivalence with TPHs.\" However, to reach 1,984 TPH results for Chevron, it is necessary to count the DRO and GRO readings for the same sample as separate TPH results. The resulting 1,984 number was inconsistent with the court record because, when Stroz Friedberg counted just the TPH results from the Filed Lab Results in the record, it arrived at a number (935) that was approximately half that of the number cited in the Judgment and generally consistent with the counts given in The Connor Report (932) and Anexo B to the Cabrera Report (964). Based on this analysis, Stroz Friedberg concludes that the most likely reason the Judgment effectively double counted most of Chevron's TPH results was its author's reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, where the DRO and GRO readings for Chevron appeared in separate rows.*\n\n*[viii] Lago Agrio Plaintiff TPH Results \u2013 In addition to the erroneous reporting of 1,984 Chevron TPH results described above, the Judgment inaccurately counted the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' TPH results, again based on its apparent reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. When discussing TPH levels, the Judgment stated, in part, \"[t]he plaintiffs' expert have submitted 420 results\" for TPH soil sample. Stroz Friedberg again found that this number was overstated. As a preliminary matter, The Connor Report and Anexo B to the Cabrera Report indicate that between 308 and 339 soil samples were taken by the plaintiffs. To perform the analysis, Stroz Friedberg reviewed entries associated with the plaintiffs' data in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Stroz Friedberg sorted the data first on the column and unique item labeled \"Fuente de datos\" (Demandantes), then on \"Matriz\" (Suelo), and finally on \"Parametro\" (\"Begins with\" TPH). This sorting had the effect of limiting results to soil samples attributed to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and analyzed for TPH. This yielded 420 results, thereby showing a match between the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation and the Judgment. Once again, there were many instances where DRO and GRO tests were counted as individual results, rather than being combined to represent one TPH value. Further distorting plaintiffs' numbers in the Judgment, some test sites in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation listed both the DRO and GRO individual tests, as well as a separate TPH value that combined these two tests. Figure 16 shows an example of this data extracted from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Based on this analysis, Stroz Friedberg concludes that reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation resulted in a substantial over counting of the plaintiffs' test results within the Judgment.*\n\n*[ix] Computed Percentages \u2013 The erroneous TPH counts in the Judgment had the additional effect of distorting the sample percentages listed in the decision. Stroz Friedberg was able to use the \"DA00000040.xls\" spreadsheet containing the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation to reproduce the percentages listed in the Judgment. Stroz Friedberg did so by sorting the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation spreadsheet to represent the three groups of \"Texaco,\" \"Demandantes,\" and \"Corte,\" removing any reference to \"Cabrera\" from the Perito column, and then grouping by the three categories discussed in the Judgment (<1000, 1000-5000, >5000). Stroz Friedberg then divided the sums in each of these columns by the inaccurate TPH counts listed in the Judgment. The percentages listed in the Judgment, along with the percentages computed using the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, are shown in Figure 17. The percentages are almost identical, and any slight differences between the Judgment and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation appear to be due to variations in decimal rounding.\"*\n\nLynch ER 1, paras 58-70.\n\n5.82.\n\nFor the reasons set out in his expert report, Mr Lynch concluded:60\n\n*\"Analysis of the 2011 Judgment indicates that it was derived from material not filed with the Court in the Lago Agrio litigation in Ecuador. Over 100 specific and repeated naming and data irregularities indicate that the data points cited in the 2011 Judgment were copied, cut-and-pasted, or otherwise taken directly from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Other forensic evidence shows that it is highly unlikely that the TPH counts, statistical percentages, or pit counts discussed in this report and cited in the 2011 Judgment were independently derived from the Filed Lab Results.\"*\n\nLynch ER 1, para 119.\n\n5.83.\n\nMr Lynch's report replaced the earlier reports of Mr Michael L. Younger (also of Stroz Friedberg), who had also earlier testified as an expert in digital forensics called by the Claimants and concluded that the Selva Viva database contains errors and commonalities that are to be found in the Lago Agrio Judgment.61 (Mr Younger withdrew on grounds of ill-health; and his expert testimony was adopted by Mr Lynch, his replacement).\n\nYounger ER 1, p. 19.\n\n5.84.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that material parts of the Selva Viva Database were used in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.85.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that Lago Agrio Judgment made improper use of these eight unfiled materials in the possession of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. Based on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal, the Tribunal finds that such use resulted from the corrupt conduct of Judge Zambrano in permitting certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives to 'ghostwrite' material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n***E: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 Forensic Linguistics***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.86.\n\nProfessor Gerald R. McMenamin, called by the Claimants, is a specialist expert in forensic linguistics, including Spanish linguistics. He compared the language of the Lago Agrio Judgment with 36 other known writings by Judge Zambrano from 2009 to 2011.\n\n5.87.\n\nIn his expert report, Professor McMenamin analysed an aggregate set of seven patterned and re-occurring \"markers of writing style\"; namely: (a) divisions of text into headings and subheadings; (b) dollar amounts; (c) form of writing the year: \"2,010\" v \"2010\"; (d) sentence \u2013 initial spacing of open quotes; (e) sentence \u2013 final punctuation of close quotes (f) form of textual ellipsis: \"[...]\" or \"...\"; (g) capitalization of month in dates: \"octubre\" or \"Octubre\".\n\n5.88.\n\nHis report's statistical analyses are not easily summarised or capable of reproduction here. The Tribunal therefore takes only one illustrative example, namely (c) the form of writing the year, in \"marked\" form (i.e. writing the four-digit year by placing a point to separate the thousands place from the remaining number-places to its right, e.g. \"2,011\") and the \"unmarked\" form (i.e. without any punctuation, e.g. \"2011\"). The report concludes as to the different uses of these marked and unmarked forms:\n\n*\"Judge Zambrano's [known writings] demonstrate this unmarked form in just 21% of its 759 occurrenc \u2010 e opportunities, and Zambrano's KNOWN writings also demonstrate a very much higher incidence of the marked form: e.g., 2,011. In 79% of the 759 occurrenc \u2010 e opportunities, the year is written with a point between the thousands and hundreds places, i.e., like the 2,011 in 03 de febrero del 2,011(See Exhibits \u2010 C3).*\n\n*It is telling that the marked form of the year (e.g., 2,010) appears in the [Lago Agrio Judgment] less that 1% of the time (once in 224 occurrenc \u2010 e opportunities), but that same marked form occurs in the KNOW \u2010 N Zambrano writings 80% of the time (600 times in 750 occurrenc \u2010 e opportunities). This indicates the probability that authors other than Judge Zambrano wrote those sections of the [Judgment] that contain references to years as expressed in dates.\"*\n\n5.89.\n\nProfessor McMenamin, having analysed the linguistic evidence on all seven markers, concluded that it is \"highly probable\" that the Lago Agrio Judgment has \"multiple authors\" and that Judge Zambrano \"did not author a significant amount\" of the Judgment.62\n\nMcMenamin ER, para 9.\n\n5.90.\n\nProfessor McMenamin was not subjected to cross-examination by the Respondent at the Track II Hearing. Whilst the Tribunal accords weight to his expert testimony, it does not regard his opinions as conclusive on the issue of 'ghostwriting'.\n\n***F: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 The Cabrera Report: Dr Barnthouse***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.91.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment expressly disclaims any reliance on the Cabrera Report. Ostensibly, it accepted Chevron's petition that the Cabrera Report was not be taken into account for the Lago Agrio Judgment.63 It appears, at first sight, not to have done so.\n\nC-931, p. 51.\n\n5.92.\n\nHowever, it did take the Cabrera Report into account indirectly. As already indicated above in Part IV (see paras 4,402), the Lago Agrio Judgment made use of Dr Barnthouse's expert testimony resting on the \"Cabrera Report\" (e.g. see page 57ff of the Judgment) and the pit calculations in Annex H1 to the \"Cabrera Report\".\n\n5.93.\n\nMoreover, as considered immediately below, the Lago Agrio Judgment relied on the Cabrera Report for the number of oil pits requiring remediation.\n\n***G: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 The Cabrera Report: The Oil Pits***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.94.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment orders the payment by Chevron of US$ 5,396 billion for soil remediation in areas of the former Concession.64 It calculates the figure of US$ 5,396 billion by multiplying the number of oil pits requiring remediation, the volume of soil per pit requiring remediation and the unit cost of remediation.\n\nC-931, p.181.\n\n5.95.\n\nAs to the number of oil pits requiring remediation, the Lago Agrio Judgment finds 880 pits attributable to Chevron (i.e. from TexPet's operations in the concession area), leading to the calculation of US$ 5,396 billion. The specific number of \"880\" pits is therefore an essential part in the calculation of the figure of US$ 5,396 billion.\n\n5.96.\n\nIn regard to these 880 pits, the Lago Agrio Judgment states:65\n\n*\"Thus, to conclude with the analysis of the presence of hazardous elements resulting from the operations of Texpet in the Consortium, and considering that the results of most of the expert reports are similar: \u2026 2. The contamination in the area of the concession extends to 7,392,000 cubic meters (m3), a figure that is arrived at considering that we have 880 pits (proven through aerial photographs certified by the Geographic Military Institute which appear throughout the record, analyzed together with the official documents of Petroecuador submitted by the parties and especially by the expert Gerardo Barros, and aggravated by the fact that the defendant has not submitted the historical archives that record the number of pits, the criteria for their construction, use or abandonment) of an area of 60 x 40 meters, and because of the possibility of leaks and spills, it should be remediated in an area of at least 5 meters around the pits, and the pits have a depth of 2.40 meters (which is a reasonable estimate, considering that the pits have different dimensions, and as we noted above, the defendant has not presented an archive or historical record that details the number or the dimensions specified for the construction of the pits.\"*\n\nC-931, pp 124-125.\n\n5.97.\n\nThe Clarification Order states, as to the identification of relevant pits:66\n\n*\"\u2026 it is emphasized that, as explained in the judgment, the Court analyzed the various aerial photographs that form a part of the record and that were certified by the military Geographic Institute. The Court found this method appropriate since all of the photographs are from before 1990, and cannot reflect the existence of pits constructed after Petroecuador assumed the operations. Thus, they only reflect those constructed by Texpet \u2026\".*\n\nC-1367, p. 15.\n\n5.98.\n\n*LBG:* The Tribunal has considered the Respondent's evidence, especially the several expert reports of Kenneth J. Goldstein, Jeffrey W. Short and Edward A. Garvey (of the Louis Berger Group). The Tribunal does not consider that their testimony answers the criticism made by the Claimants' expert witnesses in regard to the specific number of 880 pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.99.\n\nIn their first report (of 2013), Messrs Goldstein and Short testified:\n\n*\"The RAP [i.e. the 1995 Remedial Action Plan] purported to identify the number of pits and affected soil areas resulting from spills that were present at each well site and production station identified in the SOW [i.e. the Scope of Work] and assessed applicable remediation requirements Conservatively assuming 3 pits per well site and 5 pits per production station, it is reasonable to estimate there were about a thousand pits scattered across the Concession Area.\"67*\n\nLBG (Goldstein & Short) ER 1, p. 28.\n\n5.100.\n\nHowever, this historical estimate was made for all pits in the former concession area. It therefore included pits that were not contaminated and contaminated pits that had been remediated under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It cannot provide evidence supporting the specific number of 880 pits requiring remediation, as found the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.101.\n\nIn their supplemental report (of 2015), Messrs Goldstein and Garvey also testified that the \"880 pit count in the Judgment is reasonable as confirmed by our review of the record and TexPet documents produced by Claimants\".68 The detailed analysis that follows is directed only at the reasonableness of the number of 880 pits. It does not in fact confirm that specific number; nor does it identify the contemporary evidential materials that could support that specific number. The issue of reasonableness is not here the critical question, which is directed at the evidence supporting the specific number of 880 pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nLBG (Goldstein & Garvey) ER 4, pp. 8-10.\n\n5.102.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment cites, in the passage above, three sources to prove its number of 880 pits. This Tribunal has been shown no cogent evidence that the specific number of 880 pits was derived from any of these three sources.\n\n5.103.\n\nThe first, the \"aerial photographs certified by the Geographic Military Institute\" did not list 880 pits. (The possible use of these photographs as a scientific method of identifying and calculating 880 pits is considered separately below). The \"official documents of PetroEcuador\" did not list 880 pits. Nor did Dr Barros list 880 pits (as the expert appointed by the Lago Agrio Court).69\n\nSee Hinchee ER 1, p. 6, fns 25 & 26.\n\n5.104.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the explanations provided by Dr Robert E. Hinchee, Dr James Ebert (of Ebert & Associates), Mr Spencer Lynch (of Stroz Friedberg), Mr Michael Younger (also of Stroz Frieberg) and Mr William Di Paolo & Ms Laura Hall (both of Di Paolo Consulting), as the Claimants' expert witnesses. These experts addressed (inter alia) the aerial photographs certified by the Geographic Military Institute and \"Anexo H1\" to the Cabrera Report. These photographs were in the filed record before the Lago Agrio Court. The Lago Agrio Judgment records that no use is there made of the Cabrera Reports.\n\n5.105.\n\nThe question arises, as the Respondent at least implicitly contends and the Claimants dispute,70 whether it was scientifically possible for Judge Zambrano to identify and calculate the number of 880 pits by studying these photographs and, if not, the further question as to where that number of 880 pits originated.\n\nR-TII SCMem. Nov. 2014, paras 161ff; Track II Hearing D1,299ff; C-TII Rep. June 2013, para 86; Track II Hearing D1.50ff.\n\n5.106.\n\n*Dr Hinchee* : In his first expert report, relying in part upon the expert reports of Dr Ebert and Mr Di Paolo & Ms Hall, Dr Hinchee concluded that none of the materials cited as proof in the Lago Agrio Judgment supported the number of 880 pits, including the aerial photographs.71\n\nHinchee ER 1, pp. 6-7.\n\n5.107.\n\nIn his third expert report, as to the pit count, Dr Hinchee also testified (with footnoted references here omitted):\n\n*\"In 2007, Petroecuador estimated only 370 pits required remediation in the former Concession. As a result of its ongoing remediation, in 2009, Petroecuador estimated only 86 pits in the former Concession required remediation. These estimates demonstrate the unreasonableness of the Judgment's 880 pit count.\"72*\n\nHinchee ER 3, p. 11.\n\n5.108.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal sets aside any issue of reasonableness in regard to the number of 880 pits. As already indicated, that is not here the critical question.\n\n5.109.\n\n*Dr Ebert:* In his report (as an expert photogramaticist), Dr Ebert stated that the aerial photographs were monoscopic (i.e. not stereoscopic), low resolution and black-and-white panchromatic images; and, also, that there were no aerial photographs for approximately 114 out of 343 sites in the record (i.e. only 33.2%).\n\n5.110.\n\nDr Ebert concluded:\n\n*\"Based on my analysis of the aerial photographs in the record, and other data provided to me, I have concluded, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that Judge Zambrano could have arrived in a valid manner at the 880 pit figure from the aerial photographs in the record. Indeed, given that Judge Zambrano has no identified experience or training in interpreting aerial photographs, and thus the aerial photographs in the record likely were largely incomprehensible to him, it is impossible that he could have reached any appropriate conclusion from a review of the aerial photographs in the record. Rather, it is far more likely that the Sentencia [i.e. the Lago Agrio Judgment] includes an 880 pit count by relying on the data in the Cabrera and/or the Stratus tables.\"73*\n\nHinchee ER 1, Exhibit 22 (Opinion of Dr Ebert), p. 2.\n\n5.111.\n\n*Mr Lynch:* Mr Lynch testified that the number of 880 pits in the Lago Agrio Judgment was calculated from the total number of 916 pits listed in \"Anexo H1\" to the Cabrera Report.74 This \"Anexo H1\" is entitled \"History and Inventory of Waste Pits Opened by the Company's Operation Texpet in the Ecuadorian Amazon\".75 It is derived, subject to one material discrepancy addressed below, from the \"Stratus Compilation\" prepared as an Excel document for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives.76\n\nC-2368, pp. 608-613; Lynch ER 1, pp. 29-30.\n\nR-1216.\n\nR-1217.\n\n5.112.\n\nMr Lynch removed from the total number of 916 the number of pits attributed in \"Anexo H1\" to PetroEcuador and those pits listed as having no environmental impact, leaving the pit number of 880 attributed to Chevron, i.e. the same number of pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.113.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's criticisms that Mr Lynch performed this calculation in an arbitrary manner, given that \"Anexo H1\" lists 916 pits and that the Stratus Compilation (in Excel format) lists 917 pits.77 The discrepancy relates to one pit mistakenly included in the latter document as a pit within the concession area, as Mr Lynch explained in his first expert report.78\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1024-1035; and D13.2817; see also R-TII SCMem. Nov. 2014, paras 161ff.\n\nLynch ER 1, p. 30, fn 23.\n\n5.114.\n\nMr Lynch testified:79\n\n*\"Relying on \u2026 Dr Ebert's opinion that it was not as the [Lago Agrio] judgment describes based on the aerial photographs, the only source that I have seen is an original version of Anexo H1, an Excel version, and then Anexo H1 itself. And my opinion is that it is more likely than not, given the analysis that I performed and the data that I had available to me, that it was derived from Anexo H1 or the original Excel version.\"*\n\nC-2368, pp. 639-640.\n\n5.115.\n\nIn his expert report (confirming the findings of the earlier expert report of Mr Younger), for the reasons there set out, Mr Lynch concluded (with footnotes here omitted):80\n\n*\"Pit Counts \u2013 On page 125 of the Judgment, the author referred to 880 pits. An examination revealed that this number likely was based on the Stratus Compilation or Anexo H-1. Stroz Friedberg observed that the Stratus Compilation contained almost the exact same data in the exact same format as the information in the Anexo H-1 document filed earlier with the Cabrera Report. Although the Anexo H-1 document listed 916 pits and the Stratus Compilation had records or rows for 917 pits, Stroz Friedberg observed that the Judgment did not include \"no impact\" figures or similar entries or those related to \"Petroecuador\" and \"Petroduccion.\" Therefore, Stroz Friedberg sorted the \"COMENTARIO DEL RAP\" column and removed all references to these entries as shown in Figure 18. The result was 880 records \u2013 the same number that appeared in the Judgment. Therefore, the count of 880 probably was arrived at by simply sorting on the RAP Comment column within the Stratus Compilation, which itself contains almost the exact same data in the exact same format as Anexo H-1.\"*\n\nLynch ER 1, pp. 29-30.\n\n5.116.\n\n*Mr Di Paolo and Ms Hall* : In their expert report, Mr William D. Paolo and Ms Laura Hall stated that Mr Cabrera's photographic interpretation was incomplete and contradictory:81\n\n*\"In a document submitted to the Nueva Loja Superior Court in April 2008 by Mr. Richard Cabrera titled \"Informe Sumario del Examen Pericial\" (translation: Summary Report of Expert Investigation), the number and area of pits at each site are presented in a summary table, Annex H-1, \"Inventario de Piscinas\" (Pit Inventory). This summary is apparently based solely on aerial photographic interpretations from 1976, 1986, and 1990, but Mr. Cabrera does not provide aerial photographs for 74% of the sites (249 of 335) and he does not perform field verification of 85% (286 of 335) of the sites. Also, he presents contradictory photographic interpretations of the pits in various annexes, as described below.*\n\n*[As to the \"Number of Pits\":] Mr. Cabrera alleges the existence of 916 pits at 335 sites using as substantiation his photograph interpretation presented in the table in Annex H-1, even though in the same table he admits that he never observed 156 of the 916 pits that he claims exist, stating in his table that there is \"no evidence\" of a pit, it is \"non-existent,\" it is \"closed,\" or there are \"no data\" for all 3 years for which he had photos. Therefore, he never observed an open pit for 17% of the pits that he claims exist in his table from Annex H-1. In addition to having incomplete photo interpretations, the interpretations he presents in Annex U4 and Annex E are contradictory. Mr. Cabrera provides photo interpretations for 85 sites in Annex E, \"Gr\u00e1ficos y An\u00e1lisis de Resultados de Diferentes Estudios\" (Graphics and Analysis of Results of Different Studies) and for a subset (39) of these sites plus one additional site in Annex U4, \"Resultados Sitio por Sitio\" (Site by Site Results). As shown in Table 1, below, the contradictions between the number of pits in Mr. Cabrera's Annex E and his Annex U4, for the 39 sites in common between them, are quite significant.\"*\n\n(Table 1 sets out a \"Comparison of photo interpretation results from Annex E and Annex H-1 with Annex U4 for the 39 sites that were included in Annex U4\").\n\nHinchee ER 1, Exhibit 21 (Opinion of Di Paolo & Hall), p. 7.\n\n5.117.\n\nTheir expert report then continues:82\n\n*\"As shown in Table 1, Mr Cabrera identified 118 pits on the photos in Annex E, but only identified 62 pits in Annex U4 at the 39 sites, using the same photos. Nevertheless, Mr Cabrera based his remediation costs on the number and size of pits shown in Annex H-1 even though his own data shown in Annex U4 indicates that there are almost 50% fewer pits that should be used for the cost estimate.\"*\n\nHinchee ER 1, Exhibit 21 (Opinion of Di Paolo & Hall), p. 7 *.*\n\n5.118.\n\nThese experts summarise their conclusions as follows, which merit here citing in full (with square brackets here added for ease of reference):83\n\n*\"[1] Aerial photography can be an excellent tool for making preliminary assessments of oilfield operations, when used by experienced interpreters for a preliminary site assessment and to observe changes over time. However, aerial photography alone is insufficient to accurately assess oil field site details, such as the existence and number of pits or oil spills. It is impossible to discern an oil spill or the presence of oil in a pit using the black and white aerial photographs available from the concession area.*\n\n*[2] Mr Cabrera's photo interpretation is incomplete since he provides no photos in Annex E or Annex U4 for 249 of the 335 sites (74%) that he claims to have evaluated. Mr Cabrera provides no explanation as to why he does not include the aerial photos for the other 249 sites, and it is impossible to determine how many potential errors Mr Cabrera may have made in photo interpretations for those additional sites.*\n\n*[3] Mr Cabrera's report contains contradictory photo interpretation results between Annex H-1, Annex E, and Annex U4. In estimating remediation costs, Mr Cabrera focuses on the results presented in Annex H-1 without describing the reasons for the discrepancies between each of the annexes in terms of the number and size of pits. In Annex U4, Mr Cabrera identifies 62 pits at the 39 sites he visited and for which he had aerial photographs in both Annexes E and U4. However, in Annexes E and H-1 he claims there are 118 pits at these same 39 sites and he uses this number to estimate his remediation cost.*\n\n*[4] Not only were the aerial photo interpretations presented by Mr Cabrera incomplete and contradictory, the interpretations he did present were grossly inaccurate with many site features being misidentified, incorrectly outlined, or nonexistent. The mistakes made in identifying features at the sites were due to the effects of shadowing; the distribution and size of vegetation; soil moisture differences; use of variable quality, relatively low resolution, black and white (panchromatic) photography; and misrepresentation of the dates of the aerial photography used. The types and number of errors found would indicate the lack of experienced photo interpretation professionals using professional, high-quality stereoscopes, and at best careless and sloppy protocol, or at worst incompetence and/or falsification of the data.*\n\n*[5] Mr Cabrera's photographic interpretations might have been improved if (1) the image interpretation results were incorporated and analyzed in a geographic information system (GIS), and (2) multiple, high-resolution aerial photos had been reviewed in stereo by qualified professionals when attempting to discern pits from other site features.*\n\n*[6] Furthermore, Mr Cabrera cannot claim that features he sees on IGM (Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Militar (translated as: Military Geographical Institute)) aerial photographs are pits or oil spills unless he has completed field observations at the site, and then used those field observations to correct his photographic interpretation. Ground-truthing is critical to verify any air photo interpretations. Remote sensing and photo interpretation standard practices require such site visits and ground observations to validate interpretations from aerial photos or any remotely sensed data.*\n\n*[7] Mr Cabrera failed to correct the errors found in his aerial photographic interpretation of pits based on his own field observations, or the field verification done as part of the Judicial Inspections. Since Mr Cabrera ignored even his own field observations, his alleged pit count is inaccurate, inflated, and without merit for calculating remediation cost estimates. Failure to correct interpretation errors at many sites, even after ground-truthing, would indicate either a gross oversight or the possible intent to falsify the number and size of pits present at these sites.*\n\n*[8] In addition to the mistakes outlined above, Mr Cabrera presented aerial photographic interpretations of well sites drilled by Petroecuador after June 1990, and he included Petroecuador pits in his report and incorrectly attributed them to Texpet. He also interpreted and included in his report pits that were constructed after June 1990 at several production stations. Furthermore, he assessed the status of pits for wells in the Cononaco oil field, saying they were interpreted from 1990 IGM aerial photographs even though IGM never took aerial photographs of this area in their 1989-1992 \"Carta Nacional\" (translation: National Mapping) aerial survey project for the Oriente region of Ecuador.\"*\n\nHinchee ER 1, Exhibit 21 (Opinion of Di Paolo & Hall), pp. 3-4\n\n5.119.\n\nBased on these materials, the Tribunal concludes that the Lago Agrio Judgment based its specific number of 880 oil pits on the Cabrera Report and not, as the Lago Judgment falsely states, on the aerial photographs, PetroEcuador's official documents or Dr Barros. The Tribunal also concludes that the Cabrera Report provided no scientific basis for the specific number of 880 pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment; and that, contrary to the Respondent's submission, the Lago Agrio Judgment's reliance on the Cabrera Report was in no way \"in some small fashion\".84\n\nR-TII SCMem. Nov. 2014, p. 82, fn 326.\n\n5.120.\n\nThe resulting amount of US$ 5,396 billion awarded as damages for soil remediation in areas of the former Concession was the largest single item of non-punitive damages in the Lago Agrio Judgment. Thus, the use in the Lago Agrio Judgment of the Cabrera Report (with its own methodology) was highly significant and material to its award of damages. It will be recalled that the Cabrera Report was drafted not by Mr Cabrera, but by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and experts in corrupt collusion with Mr Cabrera (see Part IV above).\n\n***H: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 Diffuse Liability***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n5.121.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment addressed and decided the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims unequivocally as \"diffuse\" claims only and not as individual claims made by a plaintiff seeking compensation for personal harm to that individual plaintiff.\n\n5.122.\n\nThus, the Lago Agrio Judgment recognises that what is being decided is not \"the existence of harm to the health of specific persons\"; or \"the existence of harm or injuries to or a specific health problem of a given individual\";85 noting also \"that the reparation of particular cases of cancer has not been demanded, nor are such cases identified, thus they are not remediable \u2026\".86 It also notes that no Lago Agrio Plaintiff had claimed \"monetary compensation\" for individual \"losses of animals and domestic farming,\"87 (The Tribunal decided in its Decision on Track 1B (by a majority) that the original complaint pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs could be read as pleading individual claims also, consistent with the individual claims pleaded in the Aguinda Litigation in New York \u2013 albeit there reserving the Tribunal's decision as to how these claims were decided in the Lago Agrio Litigation).88\n\nC-931, pp. 139-139.\n\nC-931, p. 184.\n\nC-931, at pp. 147.\n\nSee the Decision on Track 1B, paras 183 & 186.\n\n5.123.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to other passages to like effect from the Lago Agrio Judgment and its subsequent Clarification Order of 4 March 2011, including the following:\n\n*\\* \"[T]he complaint has been signed by 42 citizens, the plaintiffs, who have not requested personal compensation for any harm, but rather have demanded the protection of a collective right in accordance with the formalities provided by the EMA, the redress of environmental harm, which as has been alleged in this lawsuit, affect more than 30,000 people, these supposedly being undetermined.\"89*\n\n*\\*\"[T]he parties potentially affected by the activities of the Consortium are divided into several different human groups, that claim to be united by the fact of being affected by an environmental harm, without all belonging to a single nationality or neighbourhood, but rather who are identifiable for sharing impacts coming from the environmental harm \u2026 connected by one same impact and a common interest in resolving it. In this way, the legal grounds on which the collective right of the plaintiffs to file this claim rests have been established to the satisfaction of the Court, summarized in the fundamental, inalienable, substantive right of action and petition, in the second place in the norms of the Civil Code to give grounds for the right to ask for redress of the harm, and in the third place in the active legal standing of the plaintiffs to be heard in this proceeding in defence of collective rights.\"90*\n\n*\\* \"This criterion also agrees with the Resolution of the Constitutional Court 1457, of 18 August 2009, which tells us that, 'In accordance with the regulation for applying the mechanisms of social participation established in the Law of Environmental Management, collective environmental rights are those rights shared by the community to enjoy a healthy environment that is free of contamination, and involving aesthetic, scenic, recreational and cultural values, physical and mental integrity, and in general, quality of life. And an environmental impact is considered to be every positive or negative change to the environment that is caused directly or indirectly by a project or activity in a determined area. That is, environmental impact is every action of man that produces changes to the physical and human surroundings.'\"91*\n\n*\\* \"Finally, with regard to the harm to people's health, it should be noted that none of these harms or impacts to human health have been proven in a specious manner; that is, proof has not been presented of the existence of harm to the health of specific persons; rather, it has been proved, epidemiologically, that there exists harm to public health. Regarding the lack of proof of the harm or injuries to the health of specific persons, this Presidency notes that the plaintiff point of view is correct in the sense that no medical certificates have been submitted to show the existence of harm or injuries to or a specific health problem of a given individual; therefore, in order to make this decision, we consider, in the first place, that the reparation of particular harm has not been requested, rather the plaintiff requests, in regards to health: 'contract on charge of the defendant, specialized persons or institutions in order to design and carry out a plan for the health improvement and monitoring of the inhabitants affected by contamination.' (page 80); thus the submitted evidence does not necessarily refer to the particular harm, but to the harm to public health, which means that the fact that no particular injuries or harm have been proved is irrelevant; and in the second place, that the abovementioned claim is coherent with the object of the complaint, which is the reparation of the environmental harm that, as been shown, are those caused to the environment or some of its components; thus, we will only analyse the existence of harm to public health and if this harm is directly related to the reported environmental impacts for which reparation is required.\".92*\n\n*\\* \"[S]ince as we have seen in this case there is not a demand for reparation of harm to the health of specific individuals, but rather a claim for the 'contract, on charge of the defendant, of specialized persons or institutions in order to design and carry out a plan for the health improvement and monitoring of the inhabitants affected by contamination', meaning that what should be analysed is the presence of a public health problem and the causation of this harm applying the mentioned theories.\"93*\n\n*\\*\"This possibility of suffering a harm, which in this case is a risk to undetermined individuals, should not leave defenseless those threatened by the contingent harm because the legislator has wisely provided for (Article 2236 of the Civil Code) the popular action suit that has been brought, by means of which have been requested, amongst other things, the removal and the adequate treatment and disposal of the contaminating wastes and materials still present, the cleaning of rivers, streams and lakes, and in general, the cleaning of the soil, plantations and crops and so on, where there are contaminating wastes produced or generated as a consequence of the operations directed by Texaco, which are precisely those contaminants mentioned in the previous lines, included in the reports of the different experts who have submitted their reports, and that threaten with the possibility, admitted by the defendants, to damage undetermined individuals, such as the ones represented by the plaintiffs.\"94*\n\n*\\* The compensation awarded in the Lago Agrio Judgment reflects the diffuse nature of the rights decided by the Lago Agrio Court: over US$ 6 billion for remediation of state-owned lands; over US$ 2 billion for a public health system (confirming \"that the individualized reparation of the health of the affected persons, who are undetermined, cannot be ordered, but measures can be ordered that equally tackle the problem in a general way\"); US$ 150 million for a potable water system to \"benefit the persons who inhabit the area\"; and US$ 100 million for \"a community reconstruction and ethnic reaffirmation program.\"95*\n\n*\\* \"[W]e must note that the reparation of particular cases of cancer has not been demanded, nor are such cases identified, thus they are not remediable, but rather to the contrary, it is considered that this evidence together with the statistics reflects an aggravating factor to the public health problem referred to above. Considering that the lack of individualization of the victims does not free from the responsibility of repairing such harm, what is appropriate to analyze is who would be the beneficiary of said remediation, therefore, paying attention to the fact that it has that it has been proven that a serious public health problem exists.\"96*\n\n*\\* \"The beneficiary of the trust shall be the Amazon Defense Front or the person or persons that it designates, considering that 'those affected' by the environmental harm, are undetermined, but determinable, persons united by a collective right.\"97*\n\n*\\* \"The additional 10% of the amount ordered as reparation of harm in name of the Amazon Defense Front\" can only be granted to those who bring actions on behalf of the community.

Rather, they are suing on behalf of thousands who say they have been affected by the existence of environmental damage. And they filed the complaint to benefit all of these people.\"100*\n\n*\\* \"In addition, it is clarified that it does not correspond to the President of this Court to 'clarify' the judgment with a list of affected persons, since it was clearly established in the judgment that we are facing a situation of damage to public health, and not to individualised claims for injuries or diseases. Thus, the manner in which the persons affected should be redressed in their health shall be through a health program established as a redress measure in the thirteenth conclusion of law of the judgment.\"101*\n\n*\\* \"Concerning the twenty-first request, it is clarified that when mention is made of damage to persons, it is explained in the judgment that what is involved is damage to their culture and damage to their health, but that are a direct consequence of the environmental damage. This should not be confused with personal damage in the sense of damage to individuals. Rather, it should be understood as damage to persons or human beings in general, and should only include such damage as is a direct consequence of the contamination, as is explained in the judgment.\"102*\n\nC-931, p. 23.\n\nC-1367, p. 4.\n\nC-1367, p. 23.\n\nC-1367, p. 24.\n\n5.126.\n\nAs already indicated, the Lago Agrio Judgment appears to award US$ 864 million or potentially US$ 1.82 billion, to the Amazon Defense Front (the \"ADF\") as the judgment debt's beneficiary to fund generalised remediation projects in the former consortium area, unrelated to any personal harm to any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs as individuals. None of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims were assigned to the ADF.\n\n5.127.\n\nThis interpretation of the Lago Agrio Judgment is supported by the terms of the subsequent Appellate Judgment and the Order clarifying the Appellate Judgment of 3 and 13 January 2012 respectively. As to the Judgment, the Appellate Court there decided:\n\n*\\* \"The economic losses suffered by the plaintiffs would constitute a loss and as such they were not alleged in the complaint and neither is there any claim whatsoever for their compensation, for which reason the record contains no grounds that would justify ordering the defendant to indemnify them, even if the existence of those losses were proven in the eyes of the judge.\"103*\n\n*\\* \"The national case law does not clearly show any reference to the action for contingent damage, for which reason its non-existent or extremely limited practical application in Ecuador can be affirmed; so there is no opposition to applying the mentioned rule to claims of an environmental character, since the ideas of the legal premise are not in any way inconsistent with that of what happens in the natural kingdom. Art. 2214 of the Civil Code imposes the obligation to redress on who caused the damage to another, and in this case the judgment is sound for establishing damage, with legal responsibility of the defendant and the nexus between the antecedent - oil production activity -, and consequently - environmental damage; not personal damage;. there lies the foundation of the obligation to provide redress; an unintentional tort - infringing Ecuadorian law that causes harm to another -, affecting not only the flora and fauna, but also other interest as a protected legal good - the health of the people in connection with the environment, and its clear result of harm.\"104*\n\n*\\*\"[I]t is clarified that the content of the publication must have the same basic elements of a message, and include the following criteria: a) The message of public apology will be distributed in the locations and in the manner described in the first instance judgment; b) The recipient of this message of public apology will be 'the communities of indigenous peoples, settlers, and in general, all those who have been affected by the damages,' referred to in the lower court judgment \u2013 February 14, 2011 \u2013 of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumb\u00edos; c) The message offeror or signatory may be an individual but acting as the legal representative of Chevron Corporation, and shall act legitimised in the name of the company Chevron Corporation to do so both in Ecuador and in the United States of America; d) The offeror will offer the recipient their most sincere apologies; e) The offeror must declare that that it laments the following: 1.- The damage caused to the ecosystem; 2.- The damages to the lives and health of the recipients; 3.- The impact suffered by their cultures; e) The offeror must declare that it also recognizes the existence of other irreparable damages and laments them; f) The offeror must recognize that the damages were caused by the implementation of inadequate technology and practices and that the use of available technology that could have prevented; or, at least decreased, the damages was omitted; g) The offeror may clarify that it is making the publication by judicial order and that it does not imply recognition of any obligation nor ulterior, civil nor criminal responsibility.\"105*\n\nC-991, p. 3.\n\nC-991, pp. 9-10.\n\nR-299, p. 2.\n\n5.128.\n\nThis analysis as to diffuse and not individual liability is supported by the terms of the later Cassation Court's Judgment of 12 November 2013. It noted:\n\n*\"The Environmental Management Act has foreseen these so-called popular-action lawsuits with regard to the environment and having to do with diffuse rights, under which rule this complaint has been filed. That is to say, as they are collective rights that are established under a popular action lawsuit \u2026.\"106*\n\nC-1975, p. 185; see also Professor Andrade's testimony at the Track II Hearing D11.2301ss.\n\n5.129.\n\nThis analysis is also supported by the terms of the Constitutional Court's Judgment of 27 June 2018. It decided that the Lago Agrio Judgment was based on the diffuse right to live in a healthy environment, citing Article 19.2 of the 2008 Constitution and Articles 14 of the current Constitution: the Lago Agrio Litigation is \"based on the right of people to live in a healthy environment, and as this is a constitutional and collective right, it must be focussed in our analysis.\"107\n\nC-2551, p. 91.\n\n5.130.\n\nThis analysis is consistent with the powers of attorney granted by the named Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to their representatives. Whatever the position in regard to these powers of attorney (as to which there appears to be an issue), it is clear that these representatives did not have any powers of attorney from individual members of the broader community of 30,000 individuals (see also the Huani Litigation summarised in Part IV above). Moreover, the \"waiver of rights\" against Ecuador and PetroEcuador ostensibly conceded by the Aguinda Plaintiffs' representatives (on 26 November 1996) was made without powers of attorney from individuals comprising the broader community.108\n\nC-911.\n\n5.131.\n\nIt is also consistent with statements made by Mr Donziger. These include the following, taken from the Crude Outtakes: \"But, you know, one change is in the beginning we always felt like the case was only for, to get money to do a proper clean-up. But we, we've broadened that out to really come to the conclusion after a lot of analysis that we should put in every category of damages we possibly can, *other than direct compensation to individuals*\"109 (emphasis here supplied).\n\nC-360, undated, at CRS-269-00- CLIP 01, pp 460-461 [00:41-00:59].\n\n5.132.\n\nLast but not least, at the Track II Hearing, the Tribunal understood that the Respondent (which was not a party to the Lago Agrio Litigation) accepted that the Lago Agrio Court did not award health-related damages based on any past or existing personal injury to any specific person or persons.110\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,103-104, 264 & 288.\n\n5.133.\n\nThis factor regarding diffuse rights decided by the Lago Agrio Judgment is relevant to the issue whether under the Treaty the Lago Agrio Judgment is barred by the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with related agreements), as the Claimants contend and the Respondent denies. The Tribunal addresses this issue later in this Award, in Part VIII.\n\n***I: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 Judge Zambrano***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n5.134.\n\nAt the later RICO trial in New York, Dr Zambrano testified in writing and orally, subject to cross-examination, in regard to the writing of the Lago Agrio Judgment.111 Dr Zambrano (who does not speak English) testified in Spanish, interpreted into English. Dr Zambrano was no longer a judge, having been dismissed from Ecuadorian judiciary in 2012.\n\nC-1981 (Declaration); C-1979 (Deposition); C-1980 (RICO Trial Transcript).\n\n5.135.\n\nAs to the authorship of the Lago Agrio Judgment, Dr Zambrano testified at the RICO trial:\n\n*\"Q. Now, Mr. Zambrano, am I correct that it is your testimony that you are the sole author of the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. And that nobody else helped you write even a word of that judgment, that's your testimony, correct, sir? A. No.*\n\n*Q. Who else helped you write even a word of that judgment, sir? A. When I dictated it to the secretary, she would write what I was dictating.*\n\n*Q. Sir, I'm not talking about the secretary taking dictation. It's your testimony, sir, that every word in that judgment was your words that you dictated, correct, sir, that's your testimony? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. And it's your testimony that nobody else wrote any of those words, only you dictated and wrote those words, that's your testimony, correct, sir? A. Yes.\"112*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1603-1604.\n\n5.136.\n\nAs regards Ms \"C\", his temporary student secretary,113 Dr Zambrano testified at the RICO trial:\n\n*\"Q. You say she typed into the computer as you dictated the Lago Agrio judgment to her, is that correct, sir? A. Yes \u2026*\n\n*Q. Did you ever write out exactly what you wanted the judgment to say in longhand and then hand her your handwritten product to just type into the computer? A. No*\n\n*Q. Dr Zambrano, did you ever show Ms [\"C\"] any documents for her to type from\" A. No \u2026*\n\n*Q. The words that Ms [\"C\"] typed into the computer as the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment were all words that you spoke out loud as dictation to her and she then typed them into the computer, correct? A. It was what I was dictating to her.\"114*\n\nDr Zambrano testified that Ms \"C\" was a young student whom Judge Zambrano employed temporarily from mid-November 2010, at US$ 15 a day, at his own expense: C-1980, pp. 1659 & 1664.\n\nC-1980, pp. 1658, 1662 & 1663.\n\n5.137.\n\nDr Zambrano testified, also at the RICO trial, as to his general working methods for drafting at the Lago Agrio Judgment, as follows:\n\n*\"For starters, I would arrive at the office at six, 6:30 in the morning, or seven, depending if it was raining. She [Ms \"C\"] would normally arrive at eight in the morning. She would sit at the computer at the chair that's in front of the table where the [New] computer was, and she would begin the day by taking some of the extracts of items that I had already singled out in some of the cuerpos, the annotations I had made. I would begin dictating by taking a document from here, another one from over here. So you have an idea as to what the office was set up, the cases, I'm sorry, the cuerpos of the trial were laid out. On some of them I had the corresponding annotations. On some occasions I would sit on the piece of furniture that was next to her desk. I would dictate. Other times I would stand up because I would reach for a document or refer to a cuerpo or to some other writing. I would refer to notes that I had made and in my mind I was developing the idea I wanted to state so she would type it accurately.\"115*\n\nC-1980, pp 1661-1662.\n\n5.138.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Lago Agrio Judgment contains numbers, formulae and abbreviations that do not lend themselves to mere oral dictation; and, in addition, it contains out of order numeric sequences identical to those in the unfiled materials which could not be the result of errors in dictation (see above). Dr Zambrano's account of his working methods is not credible. His account is not accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n5.139.\n\nLater, as to authorship and research, Dr Zambrano testified:\n\n*\"Q. Did you work long hours to prepare the judgment, sir? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. Did you pour your heart and soul into working on that judgment, nights, weekends? \u2026 A. I worked many hours, many days, including several weekends.*\n\n*Q. And nobody else provided assistance to you with the research you say you needed to do to write the judgment, correct, sir? \u2026 A. Could you please clarify what you mean by assistance, in what sense?*\n\n*Q. Nobody else provided assistance to you in connection with you preparing the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment, correct, sir? \u2026 A. No.*\n\n*Q. Other than the typist you mentioned earlier, am I correct, sir, that nobody \u2026 A. No one has helped me to write the judgment. I was the one who exclusively drafted it.*\n\n*Q. And nobody helped you do the research you needed to do to write and author the judgment, correct, sir? A. I did the research.\"116*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1607-1608.\n\n5.140.\n\nAt the RICO trial, as regards the allegation that Dr Guerra played a part in drafting orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment, Dr Zambrano testified:\n\n*\"Q. Did Mr. Guerra help you with drafts in connection with the orders you issued in the Chevron case? A. Never.*\n\n*Q. Sir, am I correct, sir, that it would have been improper under Ecuadorian law to have anyone else help you author the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment? A. Yes.\"117*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1648-1649.\n\n5.141.\n\nAt the RICO trial, Dr Zambrano admitted that Dr Guerra had drafted *other* orders issued by him:\n\n*\"Q: Sir, did there come a time when Mr Guerra was no longer a judge? A: Yes.*\n\n*Q: And you were still a judge when Mr Guerra left the bench, correct? A: Yes.*\n\n*Q: Am I correct, sir, that Mr Guerra helped you with the drafting of orders in your cases back in 2010 and 2011? A: Yes.\"118*\n\nC-1980, p. 1630.\n\n5.142.\n\nDr Zambrano further testified at the RICO trial that Ms \"C\" was responsible for carrying out internet research:\n\n*\"Q: \u2026While you were working on the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment, who conducted the Internet searches on the new computer? A: I have stated that it was Ms [\"C\"].*\n\n*Q: Who else conducted Internet searches on the new computer on which you were working on drafting the Lago Agrio judgment? A: I would give the topic to Ms [\"C\"]. She would find it for me. Even when it was very late, she would take that topic and then bring it back to me.*\n\n*Q: \u2026 She is the only person who did Internet searches you requested on the new computer that you used to draft the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment, correct, sir? A: Yes.*\n\n*Q: Did you do any Internet searches yourself to help you research the Chevron case, without Ms [\"C\"]'s help, on that new computer?*\n\n*A: No.\"119*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1683-1684.\n\n5.143.\n\nAt the RICO trial, as regards the use of his \"Old\" and \"New\" computers for the Lago Agrio Judgment, Dr Zambrano testified:\n\n*\"Q. Mr. Zambrano, I wanted to ask you some questions about the computer in your office on which you dictated to Ms [\"C\"] the judgment in the Lago Agrio Chevron case. Sir, was this computer an office computer assigned to you by the judicial council? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. Was this a desktop computer? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. All of the typing of the judgment was done on this one computer, not any other, correct? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. When you first became a judge in Lago Agrio in 2008, you were assigned a different computer by the judicial council, correct? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. And then when the court equipment was modernized, you received a new computer from the judicial council, correct? A. Yes.*\n\n*Q. It was on this new computer that the whole writing of the judgment was done, correct? A. Yes.\"120*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1678-1679.\n\n5.144.\n\nDr Zambrano was also questioned during the RICO trial about his use of Excel spreadsheets:\n\n*\"Q: Sir, were there ever any Excel spreadsheets left outside your door at the courthouse in these packages you say were left there during the Lago Agrio Chevron case? A: I don't recall.*\n\n*Q: Do you even know what an Excel spreadsheet is, sir? A: No.*\n\n*Q: Sir, how did you calculate the percentages of TPH levels that are in this judgment at pages 101 and 102, if you recall, sir? A: No.*\n\n*Q: Can't recall, correct? A: I don't recall exactly.*\n\n*The Court: What is your best recollection, sir? The Witness: This was taken from the reports that were being submitted by the experts.\"121*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1697-1698.\n\n5.145.\n\nThese percentages of TPH were not calculated from expert reports filed in the Lago Agrio Court. Dr Zambrano's explanation is also inconsistent with his testimony that he dictated the Lago Agrio Judgment to his student secretary. Moreover, Dr Zambrano does not speak English. The term \"TPH\" (shorthand for total petroleum hydrocarbon) is used multiple times in the Lago Agrio Judgment, whereas the equivalent Spanish term is \"HTP\".122 The explanation lies in the use of \"TPH\" in the unfiled Fusi\u00f3n Memorandum, as used in the Lago Agrio Judgment in awarding US$ 5.4 billion for the cleaning-up of TPH.\n\nC-1980, p. 1615.\n\n5.146.\n\nIn relation to his workload during the period between October 2010 and February 2011, Dr Zambrano testified at the RICO Trial:\n\n*\"Q: Sir, during the period from October 2010 through February 14, 2011, you had many other civil and criminal cases that were assigned to you to decide besides the Lago Agrio Chevron case, correct? A: Yes.*\n\n*Q: And you issued many other orders in your other cases during the period from October 2010 through February 14, 2011, correct, sir? A: Could you please repeat the question?*\n\n*Q: You issued many other orders in your other cases besides the Lago Agrio Chevron case during the period October 2010 to February 14, 2011, correct, sir? A: Yes.*\n\n*Q: In fact, it's possible that you issued more than 200 written orders or judgments in your other cases besides the Lago Agrio Chevron case between October 2010 and February 14, 2011, correct, sir? \u2026A: It is likely.\"123*\n\nC-1980, pp. 1738-1739.\n\n5.147.\n\nOn the specific question of bribery, Dr Zambrano testified at the RICO trial as follows:\n\n*\"Q: Dr Zambrano, did you ever solicit a bribe in the Lago Agrio Chevron case from anyone? A: Never, from no one.*\n\n*Q: Did you ever agree to accept a bribe in the Lago Agrio case from anyone? A: I would never do so because it would go against my principles.*\n\n*Q: Did you ever agree for payment or the promise of payment to allow someone else to write a part of the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment? A: No.*\n\n*Q: Can you tell us whether or not you ever agreed in exchange for payment or the promise of payment to, in the Lago Agrio Chevron case, to rule in favor of one particular party? \u2026 A: Never. As I've stated, that would go against my principles.\"124*\n\nC-1980, p. 1806.\n\n5.148.\n\nIn his RICO Declaration, Dr Zambrano testified:\n\n*\"\u2026 Since it was a complex and enormous case, I spent many hours working on the case, especially at night. Obviously for logical reasons I spoke to different people, especially Judges and former Judges for their points of view about certain aspects of the case. I never consulted with any of the litigant parties. I confirm that I am the only author of the judgment that I issued on February 14, 2011, and of the clarification that I issued on March 4, 2011. I did not receive support or assistance from Dr Alberto Guerra or from any other person, much less from the litigant parties. It is not true that Dr Guerra reviewed the judgment, since neither he nor anyone else reviewed it before it was issued. It is false that Dr Alberto Guerra worked in my home. He has never entered my house in Lago Agrio or in any other province for any reason. I have never told Dr Guerra to approach the parties to ask them for money. I composed and prepared the judgment on the computer that the Judiciary Council had assigned to me, which was in my possession prior to the analysis of the principal subject matter of the trial. For such purpose each of the documents submitted by the litigant parties was reviewed \u2026\"125*\n\nC-1981, paras 13-15.\n\n5.149.\n\nThe Tribunal has tried to give Dr Zambrano, as a witness, the benefit of any reasonable doubt. He was testifying in a foreign procedure through an interpreter; he was addressing events taking place years before; no judge recalls in full the details of his or her judgment years later; he had probably never been cross-examined before; his crossexaminer during his deposition appears to have lost his temper to an extent that would shock any civilian lawyer; and, whilst Dr Zambrano was provided with his own counsel, there was clearly insufficient time for him to brief her on the complexities of the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Ecuadorian legal system. Further, it may be a significant disadvantage for this Tribunal to assess his testimony on transcripts only, without seeing Dr Zambrano testify in person.\n\n5.150.\n\nYet, having made all these and other allowances in his favour, it is clear from the transcripts of his testimony that Dr Zambrano was a most unsatisfactory witness. In short, the Tribunal finds his testimony, on material issues, incredible; and the Tribunal does not accept it.\n\n***J: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 Ms \"C\"***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n5.151.\n\nFor the RICO Litigation in New York, Ms \"C\" testified, in writing, as Judge Zambrano's temporary student secretary.126 Unfortunately, Ms \"C\" never gave any deposition in the RICO Litigation or oral testimony at the RICO trial. It appears that she could have done so, having received her visa from the USA before the end of the trial in the RICO Litigation; but then the RICO defendants informed the Court that she would not testify at the RICO trial. As a result of her absence from the RICO trial, Ms \"C\" was never cross-examined on her written testimony. Ms \"C\" was not a witness in this arbitration.\n\nC-2458 (Declaration); C-2387 (Direct Examination).\n\n5.152.\n\nIn her first Declaration of 30 October 2013, made in Spanish and sworn before a notary in Lago Agrio, Ms \"C\" testified (with paragraph numbers here added):\n\n*\"[1] \u2026 I declare that during the middle of the month of November of two thousand ten, I was called by Attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada, in order to help him with the digital entry of the cases that he was handling in his role as President of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumb\u00edos, and, among others, on one very particular case that I remember, called for DAMAGES being pursued by Ms MARIA AGUINDA ET AL., against CHEVRON CORPORATION, and which was numbered as ZERO ZERO TWO DASH TWO THOUSAND THREE (002-2003).\"*\n\n*[2] That my working hours were from eight a.m. to twelve p.m.; and from two p.m. until six p.m., seven p.m., eight p.m., and on some occasions until nine p.m., and that for this I received a daily salary of fifteen United States dollars. Additionally, and in all honesty, I state that on most occasions after I left for my home, attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada continued to work and he would lock the door; I did this until the end of the month of February of two thousand eleven when I told attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada that I would not go anymore, because my university studies did not allow me to do so;*\n\n*[3] Likewise, I must state that during the time that I worked exclusively for attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada, I only received dictation from him, and that he did it from his handwritten notes that he took every day and from the constant review of a large number of binders that case had. I also declare, that when attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada left the office to fulfill his duties, he asked me to also leave and wait for him outside until he returned; he never left me alone in his office, he did not allow it, and he also did not allow outside people to enter it, nor did I ever see attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada, with regard to the referenced case, have any discussion with anyone, at least in my presence.*\n\n*[4] The judgment of the case: Mar\u00eda Aguinda et al. against Chevron Corporation dated February fourteenth of the year two thousand eleven, at eight thirty-seven a.m. Likewise, I declare that during the time that I spent in attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada's office, I did not receive instructions, or dictation, from any other person that were not those from attorney Nicol\u00e1s Augusto Zambrano Lozada, neither was a pen-drive or CD or another storage device used in the digital entry of the judgment in the case being pursued by Mar\u00eda Aguinda et al., against CHEVRON CORPORATION. This is all I have to declare, in all honesty...\"127*\n\nC-2458.\n\n5.153.\n\nIn her subsequent witness statement of 12 November 2013, made in Spanish and signed in Quito, Ms \"C\" testified in similar terms:\n\n*\"1. I am an Ecuadorian citizen of twenty years of age. I have my domicile at \u2026 of the city of Nueva Loja, in the Providence of Sucumbios. I am currently studying law at the Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja [Private Technical University of Loja], and working at the National Development Bank, in the legal department.*\n\n*2. Between the month of November of the year 20l0, and the end of February 2011, I worked for Dr Nicolas Augusto Zambrano Lozada. My work mainly consisted of typing on a computer the text of the ruling of the trial known as \"Aguinda, et al. v. Chevron Corporation\" (number 002-2003), following the dictation of Dr Zambrano. The ruling was handed down on February 14 of the year 2011.*\n\n*3. The work for Dr Zambrano I performed in his office, in the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios, in the city of Nueva Loja, at a desk with a computer that was available there. For my work, I received the amount of $15 USD daily, and my work schedule was from 8am to 12pm, and from 2pm to 5, 6, 7, 8 and even until 9pm. When I would leave, Dr Zambrano in many occasions would stay in his office.*\n\n*4. The typing process of the aforementioned ruling was as follows: Dr Zambrano had in his office many files of the record, as well as great quantities of handwritten notes, and other research texts. He would constantly review and contrast these materials, going from one side of his office to the other, as he would dictate the sentence to me while I would type it in the computer. At no time did Dr Zambrano base his dictation on preexisting printed versions of the ruling; I can attest to this because of the slow pace that he had when dictating his ideas, sometimes returning to previous parts and correcting them.*\n\n*5. Another of the tasks entrusted to me by Dr Zambrano was doing general Internet research of rulings and other reference texts, which I would print and hand them over for his reading and analysis. For this, I always used the computer of the Court. I do not remember which were the subjects or matters that he entrusted to me to research.*\n\n*6. Dr Zambrano was always very careful and would verify that his office was always safe, always leaving it locked in his absence. When he was absent during my work schedule, he would ask me to wait for his return outside of his office.*\n\n*7. During the time that I worked for Dr Zambrano typing the ruling, there was never a third person present in his office, and I never received a dictation or instructions from any person other than Dr Zambrano.*\n\n*8. During all of the time of dictation and typing of the ruling, there was never connected to the computer on which I worked any external storage device such as USB drive (pen drive) or external hard drive, nor were there any CD or DVD inserted in the same.\"128*\n\nC-2387.\n\n5.154.\n\nIt is evident that Ms \"C\"'s written testimony, albeit limited, ostensibly supports the testimony of Dr Zambrano in general terms. However, having not been subjected to any cross-examination at the RICO trial (or in this arbitration), the Tribunal accords her written testimony no weight on any material issue of fact. There also many unanswered questions arising from her testimony, including the scope of her foreign language skills and her abilities as a researcher of foreign legal materials. Ms \"C\" was a 17 or 18 year-old student paid US$ 15 an hour; and she was neither a trained legal assistant nor a professional secretary.\n\n5.155.\n\nThe Tribunal records that there is no evidence before this Tribunal that Ms \"C\" participated in or was aware of any 'ghostwriting' during her brief and limited employment by Judge Zambrano. Moreover, the Tribunal has grave reservations as to the manner in which the two statements were produced in her name in the RICO Litigation.\n\n***K: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 Dr Guerra***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n5.156.\n\nFor the RICO trial in New York and for this arbitration, Dr Guerra testified in the form of his three RICO statements,129 his depositions of 2 May 2013130 and 5 November 2013;131 his oral testimony at the RICO trial,132 his Witness Statement133 and his oral testimony at the Track II Hearing.134\n\nC-1616A; C-1648; C-1828; R-1331.\n\nC-1888; R-906.\n\nR-907; C-2358.\n\nC-1978.\n\nC-2358; C-2386.\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,594-D4,900.\n\n5.157.\n\nIn his RICO statement, Dr Guerra testified:\n\n*\"\u2026 25. In late January or early February of 2011, approximately two weeks before the trial court in the Chevron case issued the judgment, Mr Zambrano gave me a draft of the judgment so that I could revise it. It was through him that I found out that the attorneys for the [Lago Agrio] Plaintiffs had written that judgment and had delivered it to him. Mr Zambrano asked me to work on the document to fine-tune and polish it so it would have a more legal framework. In recalling these facts initially, I assumed I had received the document on a flash drive given to me by Mr Zambrano in the Quito airport, as he usually did with the projects I helped him with. But later on I specifically remembered that I worked on that document in Mr Zambrano's residence in Lago Agrio using Mr Fajardo's computer. I do not recall the exact date this happened, but I worked on the draft judgment for several hours during two days. Mr Zambrano explicitly asked me not to make copies nor leave traces of this document nor the changes I was making, outside of the file on which I worked.*\n\n*26. I began to work on the document as soon as I received it. First I read the holding and I began to work on several sections that needed more structure and basis, especially with terminology related to environmental law. I remember that I called Mr Fajardo on his cell phone to ask him about some sections of the document that confused me. Mr Fajardo told me not to worry and that he would e-mail me a memory aid to clarify my questions. Mr Fajardo e-mailed me a document of around 10 to 12 pages titled \"Memory Aid,\" with some information about the case. In reality, the document did not help me much with my doubts, so that day I worked on punctuation and spelling. I spent the following day making around 20 changes to improve its structure and make it seem more like a judgment issued by the Sucumb\u00edos Court.*\n\n*27. Overall, I made very few changes to this document\u2014mostly word changes due to personal preference - and the document I returned to Mr Zambrano was not too different from the one the Plaintiffs had given him.*\n\n*28. Based on what Mr. Zambrano told me, it is my understanding that the Plaintiffs' attorneys made changes to the judgment up to the very last minute before it was published. But I have never read the final judgment that was published on February 14, 2011 and signed by Judge Zambrano; therefore I don't know for certain what changes were made after I turned the project over to Mr. Zambrano. After Mr. Zambrano issued the judgment, I assisted him over the phone as he prepared the supplemental and clarification order for the judgment\u2026\"135*\n\nC-1616A, paras 25-28.\n\n5.158.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing, Dr Guerra testified that Judge Zambrano gave him a draft of the Lago Agrio Judgment for his review and comments a couple of weeks before the issue of the Judgment on 14 February 2011 (i.e. in the last week of January or the first week of February 2011); and that Dr Zambrano told him he had received it from Mr Fajardo.136 Judge Zambrano also told Dr Guerra that he (Judge Zambrano) would receive US$ 500,000 for agreeing to let the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs prepare the Lago Agrio Judgment, to be paid once they \"received the product of the judgment when it was implemented.\"137\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,601.\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,679-680.\n\n5.159.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing, under cross-examination, Dr Guerra also testified that, upon studying the draft Judgment, he contacted Mr Fajardo for an explanation of certain issues that concerned him. As a result, Mr Fajardo supplied Dr Guerra with a document known as \"the Memory Aid\".138 However, this document did not help Dr Guerra; and he did not use it.139\n\nR-1331, para 3.\n\nTrack II Hearing D4,778-779.\n\n5.160.\n\nApart from the Memory Aid, there is no corroboration of these two aspects of Dr Guerra's testimony from any contemporary documentation or electronic record. The Memory Aid, by itself, is an inconclusive document. In these circumstances, the Tribunal accords little weight to this part of Dr Guerra's testimony.\n\n***L: The Lago Agrio Judgment \u2013 Mr Donziger***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n5.161.\n\nIn his final written testimony, Mr Donziger testified:\n\n*\"I did not write the judgment in the Aguinda case in Ecuador. I have no knowledge that anybody on the legal team of the plaintiffs wrote the judgment in this case, or wrote any part of the judgment.*\n\n*I have never met Judge Nicolas Zambrano, nor have I ever communicated with him. Other than his live testimony during this trial, I have never seen Judge Nicolas Zambrano.*\n\n*I did not bribe Judge Zambrano. The allegations by former Judge Alberto Guerra that I was involved in a meeting where I approved a plan suggested by Pablo Fajardo to pay Zambrano $500,000 is false. Chevron has no evidence that I had any involvement in bribing any judge apart from Guerra's thoroughly false and corrupt testimony.*\n\n*I have no knowledge of anybody on the plaintiffs' team paying or seeking to pay Judge Zambrano.\"140*\n\nC-2385, paras 71-74.\n\n5.162.\n\nIn his depositions, Mr Donziger testified:\n\n*\"Q: Did anyone affiliated in any way with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs provide any portion of the text of the Fusi\u00f3n Memo, Exhibit 1806A, in any form to Judge Zambrano prior to February 1st, 2011? A: I don't believe so.*\n\n*Q: Did anyone affiliated in any way with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs provide any portion of the Fusi\u00f3n Memo marked as Exhibit 1806A to anyone associated with Judge Zambrano prior to February 1st of 2011? A: I don't believe so. But to be as clear as possible, it is possible this memo was provided to the court to be put into evidence, or some version of it.*\n\n*Q: Are you aware of an occasion on which Exhibit 1806A, the Fusi\u00f3n memo, was provided to the court in Lago Agrio? A: No.*\n\n*\u2026 Q: Prior to February 1st of 2011 did anyone affiliated in any way with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs draft a judgment that included any portion of the text of the Fusi\u00f3n memo? A: No, not that I know of.141*\n\n*Q: Prior to February 1st of 2011, you were involved in having draft Lago Agrio judgments prepared, correct? A: No, I don't believe so.*\n\n*Q: Would you agree that portions of the rest of the Fusi\u00f3n memo, Exhibit 1806A, were at some point in some form provided to Judge Zambrano? A: I wouldn't characterise it that way, no.142*\n\n*\u2026 Q: Did the Lago Agrio plaintiff team at any time develop a proposed judgment for the Lago Agrio case? A: I don't believe so. I don't know. It is possible.*\n\n*Q: Did you personally ever draft any portion of a draft judgment for Lago Agrio? A: I don't believe so.\"143*\n\nC-1003, pp. 4686-4688.\n\nC-1003, p. 4726.\n\nC-1003, pp. 4814-4815.\n\n5.163.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr Donziger's guarded answers based on his non-belief, lack of knowledge or even possibilities, when he was one of the principal actors at all material times with personal knowledge of almost every aspect of the Lago Agrio Litigation, are curiously evasive. None can be categorised as an unequivocal denial of the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.164.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal does not accept that Mr Donziger had no knowledge, at the time, as to the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, in corrupt collusion with Judge Zambrano. The Tribunal finds that Mr Donziger, with others, was privy to such 'ghostwriting' and collusion.\n\n***M: The Judgment of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court (2012)***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.165.\n\nBy its judgment of 3 January 2012, extending over 16 pages, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court affirms the Lago Agrio Judgment.144 It upholds the punitive damages award because Chevron had refused publicly to \"apologise\". It also decides that it cannot address Chevron's fraud allegations regarding the conduct of the Lago Agrio Litigation. The appeal was otherwise, ostensibly, a *de novo* hearing based on the evidence filed the Lago Agrio Court. Given the volume and complexity of that evidence, grave doubts arise as to the thoroughness required for such a *de novo* hearing,\n\nC-991.\n\n5.166.\n\nAs to the nature of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims decided by the Lago Agrio Court, the Appellate Court confirms that the Lago Agrio Judgment addressed and decided these claims unequivocally as \"diffuse\" claims and not as individual claims made by a plaintiff seeking compensation for personal harm to that individual plaintiff (see above for the references to the Appellate Court's Judgment and subsequent order clarifying its judgment).\n\n5.167.\n\nAs to Chevron's \"fraud\" allegations, this judgment of the Appellate Court reads in part:\n\n*\"Mention is also made of fraud and corruption of plaintiffs, counsel and representatives, a matter to which this Division should not refer at all, except to let it be emphasized that the same accusations are pending resolution before authorities of the United States of America due to a complaint that has been filed by the very defendant here, Chevron, under what is known as the RICO act, and this Division has no competence to rule on the conduct of counsel, experts or other officials or administrators and auxiliaries of justice, if that were the case.\"145*\n\nC-991, p. 10.\n\n5.168.\n\nThe Appellate Court issues a Clarification Order of its Appellate Judgment on 13 January 2012. It effectively grants the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' requests for clarification, including a statement that the Appellate Court had considered and rejected evidence of the fraudulent conduct of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives.\n\n5.169.\n\nThe relevant passage, relating to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' seventh request, merits citation in full. It reads (in English translation, with numbered paragraphs here added for ease of reference) as follows:146\n\n*\"7. [1] In relation to the seventh request for clarification, regarding whether or not the defendant's accusations with respect to irregularities in the preparation of the trial court judgment have been considered, it is clarified that yes such allegations have been considered, but no reliable evidence of any crime have been found.*\n\n*[2] The Division concluded that the evidence provided by Chevron Corporation, does not lead anywhere without a good dose of imaginative representation, therefore it has not been given any merit, nor has more space been dedicated to it.*\n\n*[3] But it is appropriate to say that the Division rejects in this point, and definitively, as unfounded, the defendant's affirmation in chapter \"C\" of its legal brief that the judgment has been based on information foreign to the record, or with secret assistance, because, as the Division reviewed and explained in the 3 January 2012 judgment, all the valid evidence that has been considered, that is to say, all of the samples, documents, reports, testimonies, interviews, transcripts and minutes, referred to in the judgment, are found in the record without the defendant identifying any that is not \u2013 the defendant's motions simply show disagreement with the reasoning, the interpretation and the value given to the evidence, but they do not identify correctly legal evidence that is in the record.*\n\n*[4] The texts indicated by Chevron Corporation, as an example that the judgment has been based on information foreign to the record, are not considered or put forth as legal evidence, not even by the defendant itself in its claim, for which reason the Division understands that it is not alleging that the judgment has been sustained on evidence foreign to the record.*\n\n*[5] Therefore, starting by considering that only the evidence legally produced is deemed authentic in trial about the facts in dispute, and that which must be in the record, it is concluded that the appealed judgment is based on legally presented evidence, that is in the record, although certainly the reasoning and the interpretation, as human \u2013 of the judge \u2013 having his intellect as source of origin, are incorporated in the record through his rulings.*\n\n*[6] It is noted that on at least one occasion of which this Division is aware, the defendant provided a considerable amount of information to the President of the Court, related to an arbitration case between Chevron Corporation and the Government of Ecuador. This information was not introduced into the record of case 002-2003 and has not been able to be valued by this Division due to the fact that the defendant has not formally entered it into the lawsuit, but even so, and in the Division's opinion, it was known and studied by the lower court judge.*\n\n*[7] In this scenario, the plaintiffs have denounced that Chevron Corporation alleged in the United States of America, one day after the appealed judgment was issued on 14 February 2011, that it suspected that Judge Zambrano had received 'secret assistance' in drafting the judgment, and therefore now it is untimely to try to say this \u2013 before the Division \u2013 and not before who ruled on the cause in the first instance so that he clarify them.*\n\n*[8] And there is no explanation for reserving these 'suspicions' in order to put them forth before this Division, if we consider, as the plaintiffs' reference, that the defendant knew of this supposed fact the day following issuance of the judgment. Apart from what has been said, this Division further considers it pertinent to make an observation about the 'secret assistance' that is spoken of for drafting the first instance judgment, and that is because of the sense of logical orientation it is difficult to conceive that, were a secret channel to have existed, used illegally by the plaintiffs to supplement or modify the judgment, that pathway would have allowed for the introduction of arguments that were decisive for the resolution of this lawsuit.*\n\n*[9] The Division cannot fail to observe that the defendant's arguments to uphold its accusations revolve around points that in reality do not provide more information that would shore up the defended position, which put in doubt any attributed secret conspiracy. It would not be fitting, therefore, for the defendant to be able easily to say that what is alleged is just an indication of a greater problem since it is public knowledge that legal proceedings for production of documents proposed by the defendant in the United States of America allowed it to access the vast majority of the internal documents prepared by the plaintiffs' representatives.*\n\n*[10] If there had been any 'secret assistance', the presumed concordance between the plaintiffs' internal documentation, and the text of the judgment would not be limited to a fairly simple interpretation of evidence that is contained in the record. This is a civil proceeding in which the Division does not find evidence of 'fraud' by the plaintiffs or their representatives, such that, as has been said, it stays out of these accusations, preserving the parties' rights to present formal complaint to the Ecuadorian criminal authorities or to continue the course of the actions that have been filed in the United States of America. This was a determining factor for the Division's considerations in the judgment that is being clarified, since it is obvious that it was not its responsibility to hear and resolve proceedings that correspond to another jurisdiction, nor was it admissible to detain the processing of this principal lawsuit \u2013 or worse, to annul it \u2013 in order to discuss and make a pronouncement on the interminable and reciprocal accusations over misconduct of some of the parties' attorneys, experts or contractors, which is why these could not affect the final result of the lawsuit.*\n\n*[11] However, this Division expresses its concern over the possibility that the abuse of right extends abroad, with the same intent shown of depriving the plaintiffs of the right that has been declared in this proceeding. It is clarified that the interests at play in this judicial proceeding exceed the interests of the adversaries or their representatives, who in the event that they feel damaged have their rights preserved to exercise them by independent channels.\"147*\n\nR-299 (also C-2314), pp. 3-4.\n\nThe original Spanish reads, in the key first, second and tenth paragraphs above: \"*7. En relaci\u00f3n al s\u00e9ptimo pedido de aclaraci\u00f3n, sobre si se ha considerado o no las acusaciones de la parte demandada respecto a irregularidades en la elaboraci\u00f3n de la sentencia de primera instancia, se aclara que si ha considerado tales alegaciones, pero no ha encontrado pruebas fehacientes de ning\u00fan delito. La Sala concluyo que los indicios aportados por Chevron Corporation, no conducen a ning\u00fan lado sin una buena dosis de representaci\u00f3n imaginativa, por lo que no se le ha dado ning\u00fan m\u00e9rito ni se le dedico mayor espacio. \u2026 De haber existido \"asistencia secreta\" alguna, la presunta concordancia entre la documentaci\u00f3n interna de los demandantes, y el texto de la sentencia no estar\u00eda limitada a una interpretaci\u00f3n bastante simple de pruebas que constan en el proceso. Este es un proceso civil en que la Sala no encuentra evidencia de \"fraude\" de los actores ni sus representantes, de modo que, como lo ha dicho, queda al margen de estas acusaciones, dejando a salvo los derechos de las partes para presentar denuncia formal ante las autoridades penales ecuatorianas o para continuar el curso de las acciones que se han interpuesto en los Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica. Esto fue determinante para las consideraciones de la Sala en la sentencia que se aclara, pues siendo evidente que no le compet\u00eda entrar en conocimiento y soluci\u00f3n de procesos que corresponden a otra jurisdicci\u00f3n, tampoco era admisible detener la tramitaci\u00f3n de este juicio principal \u2013 o peor, anularlo \u2013 para discutir y pronunciarse sobre las interminables y reciprocas acusaciones sobre inconductas de algunos abogados, peritos o contratistas de las partes, por lo que \u00e9stas no podr\u00e1n afectar el resultado final del juicio. \u2026\".*\n\n5.170.\n\nThis statement in the Clarification Order seems materially inconsistent with the passage in the Appellate Judgment, cited above. In any event, it is somewhat difficult to follow the logic of the Appellate Court. It appears to limit its consideration to \"legal evidence that is in the record\" of the Lago Agrio Court. Chevron's complaint was not so limited. Nor could it have been before the Lago Agrio Judgement was issued by the Lago Agrio Court.\n\n5.171.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal adopts the expert testimony of Dr Coronel to the effect that \"the appellate court specifically refused to fulfil its obligation to perform a comprehensive review of both the facts and the law regarding the dispute, as well as the allegations of fraud, as Chevron Corporation ('Chevron') had requested it to do.\"148\n\nCoronel ER 7, para 10.\n\n***N: The Judgment of the Cassation Court (2013)***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n5.172.\n\n*12 November 2013* : The Cassation (National) Court issues its Judgment affirming part of the Lago Agrio Judgment; but it nullifies the punitive damages imposed for Chevron's omission to \"apologise\", as required by that Judgment and as upheld by the Appellate Court.149 As a result, the Cassation Court reduces the Lago Agrio Judgment's award of damages to US$ 8.6 billion, with 10% to be paid to the ADF.\n\nC-1975.\n\n5.173.\n\nThe grounds for Chevron's cassation appeal included: (i) the inadequate application, lack of application or erroneous interpretation of procedural rules resulting in the irremediable nullity of the proceedings or in the appellant's defenselessness, provided they have influenced the judgment and that the respective nullity has not been legally validated; (ii) the judgment's lack of formal requirements provided for by law or the adoption of incompatible or contradictory decisions in the judgment's operative part; (iii) an extra petita or infra petita judgment; (iv) the inadequate application, lack of application or erroneous interpretation of applicable evidentiary rules, provided they lead to an erroneous application or to the lack of application of legal rules in the judgment; and (v) the inadequate application, lack of application or erroneous interpretation of applicable legal rules, including mandatory judicial precedent, which were determinative for the judgment's operative part. In short, these grounds included Chevron's fraud allegations and the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.174.\n\nThe first 48 pages of the Judgment summarise the cassation claims made by Chevron. At pages 48-51, the Judgment sets forth the limits on the Cassation Court's powers to annul an inferior court's decision. Such limits are essentially of formalistic nature and are listed in Article 346 (formerly 355) of the Ecuadorian Code of Civil Procedure. Consequently, under Ecuadorian law, cassation controls do not extend to the review of evidence. An evaluation of the evidence is permissible only when the inferior decision was manifestly illogical, irrational or arbitrary (see pages 145-166 of the Judgment, No. 8.2ff). The purpose of the cassation review (as the Judgment states) is not to serve as a third instance appeal. It is limited to ensuring that the principles of legality and the respect of the Constitution of Ecuador are safeguarded. The Cassation Court confirms that its controls are limited to judging whether such principles have been infringed by the Appellate Court, but that they do not extend further to the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.175.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Cassation Court:\n\n(a) Did not review de novo the conclusion of the Lago Agrio Court or the confirmation by the Appellate Court of the assertion of jurisdiction over Chevron by the Lago Agrio Court on the basis of the Chevron and Texaco \"merger\"; the Cassation Court accepted that Chevron voluntarily accepted the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian courts, particularly of the Lago Agrio Court, in the Aguinda Litigation in New York (Nos. 5.2-5.4, pages 51-67; No. 6.4. pages 110-111);\n\n(b) Did not review any expert reports as to their legality, consistency, weight, intrinsic value, contradictions, whether they were \"ghostwritten\" or not, or review their evaluation by Judge Zambrano (No. 5.11, page 85);\n\n(c) Did not review whether there had been any procedural fraud committed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives; moreover, procedural fraud would not be known under Ecuadorian civil law or criminal law; and it is not a ground to nullify a court decision in Ecuador (No. 5.13, pages 89-91; No. 6.12, pages 120-121);\n\n(d) Did not pronounce itself on the integrity or independence of Judges Y\u00e1nez, Nu\u00f1ez, Ordo\u00f1ez, Zambrano or the validity of Dr Calmbacher's testimony (No. 5.15, pages 93-96);\n\n(e) Did not consider or determine whether the Lago Agrio Judgment or other court orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation were \"ghostwritten\" or not (No. 5.16, pages 98-99);\n\n(f) Did not review whether the Lago Agrio Court's conclusions on the principle of causality for harm or damages were correct or whether the Lago Agrio Court contradicted itself in the calculation of damages, or whether the damages were correctly calculated by the Lago Agrio Court (Nos. 6.7, 6.8, pages 115- 117); and\n\n(g) Did not establish whether the Lago Agrio Judgment was based on evidence not asked for, not produced or not ordered in accordance with Ecuadorian law (No. 6.9, pages.118-119).\n\n5.176.\n\nThe Judgment also rejected the submissions made by Chevron, by the Cassation Court's decisions:\n\n(i) The Lago Agrio Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to apply the 1999 EMA; and, thus, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had standing to pursue \"diffuse\" rights (No. 5.6, pages 67-75);\n\n(ii) Although the Judgment upheld Chevron's cassation claim of insufficient reasons regarding the falsity of signatures for some of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Complaint, the Cassation Court minimises the importance of such falsity. It decides that that such falsity, even if proven true, had been cured by several presentations throughout the Lago Agrio Litigation by representatives duly empowered by such Plaintiffs; and that, in any case, such issues were not for civil courts (nor for the Cassation Court), but for criminal courts to investigate and determine. It also decides that the validity of the powers of attorneys, representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, were public documents whose authenticity could only be challenged in the criminal courts (No. 5.12, pages 8690; No. 6.2, page 104-106);\n\n(iii) The 1995 Settlement Agreement lacks the effect of res judicata in respect of diffuse rights such as those claimed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; neither the State of Ecuador nor its Municipalities had the exclusive right to advance or protect such rights prior to the 1999 EMA; and, even before the EMA, individuals had the right to advance or assert \"diffuse\" rights. Therefore, Chevron's argument that there was a retrospective application of substantive provisions of the EMA by the Lago Agrio Court was unfounded (No. 9.3-9.8, pages 174-202);\n\n(iv) The Cassation Court applies the 1999 EMA to Chevron, essentially on the basis of Article 396 of the (then current) Ecuadorian Constitution, establishing an objective basis for the causation of harm in Ecuador when attributing environmental liability. Such liability would also carry with it the jurisdiction of Ecuadorian courts to hear and decide claims, even in respect of companies not present in Ecuador and, as well, to dispense with any requirement to identify PetroEcuador's shared responsibility for environmental damage claimed in the Lago Agrio Litigation against Chevron (No. 6.6, pages 113-115); and\n\n(v) The Cassation Court concludes that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims, as addressed by the Lago Agrio Court and the Appellate Court, were \"diffuse\" and not individual claims for personal loss or damage suffered by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs as individuals.\n\n5.177.\n\nAs regards Chevron's allegations regarding \"procedural fraud\", the Cassation Judgment states, in material part (with citations here omitted):\n\n*\"Chevron Corporation alleges that there is a 'great collusive demonstration'. When collusion is an independent action governed by our Ecuadorian legislation, it is so regulated under the Collusion Prosecution Act; and, as stated by this Division of the Court, it is not possible to seek the cassation of a judgment by making these kinds of allegations, even more so when, according to the cassation appellant's affirmations, Judge Nu\u00f1ez was subject to a proceeding before the Judicial Council. Therefore, the affirmation made by the court of appeals is the correct one, as it is not within its scope of that court to have jurisdiction to hear collusive action cases within a summary verbal proceeding, or procedural fraud, judges' behaviours, proper and improper meetings, the appointment of substitute judges, plaintiffs' connivance, among other allegations made by the appellant company.*\n\n*With respect to the various ancillary proceedings for clarification and expansion alleged in cassation by appellant, which are an essential part of the procedural sequence, also known as horizontal remedies and decided by the court of appeals, in that it lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide cases of procedural fraud, it is for that reason that the order for clarification requested by the parties allows such parties to bring such legal actions as they believe are available to them. In determining in a sufficient and clear manner that there was no procedural fraud in these proceedings, in the opinion of the Appeals Court, does not mean that the order issued on January 3, 2012 is inconsistent with the judgment rendered on January 13, 2012; it is clear that, by preserving the rights and actions of the parties, the court acknowledges the lack of jurisdiction to decide whether or not there has been procedural fraud.*\n\n*The conclusion that emerges from the foregoing is that there is no contradiction between the judgment handed down on January 3, 2012 and the order issued on January 13, 2012, or any kind of arbitrariness. Arbitrariness occurs when the order or judgment go against the law, in this specific case and as already reviewed by this Cassation Court, through the lack of jurisdiction of the court of appeals to decide on matters such as procedural fraud, there is no arbitrariness and, accordingly, Article 281 of the Code of Civil Procedure has not been infringed. For these reasons the charge is dismissed.*\n\n*As explained [above], the fact that the Trial Court has determined that there is no evidence of procedural fraud, and at the same time, lacks jurisdiction to decide on such matters, does not mean that there is any inconsistency, because 1) The subject matter of the judgment is not the existence or absence of procedural fraud. 2) Jurisdiction to decide on the existence of procedural fraud does not lie with the trial court or with the Appeals Court.*\n\n*If the Court does not find the evidence required to determine the existence or absence of procedural fraud, this does not, in and of itself, mean that there was none, since under the law of most countries and as discussed and explained in this judgment, such matters are dealt with separately, and the subject matter of the action is the determination of whether or not procedural fraud was committed. The matters in dispute in this case are different, the action is based on other grounds, and it is a summary verbal proceeding, which cannot be used to determine this type of ancillary proceeding.\"150*\n\nC-1975, pp. 95, 120-121 (regarding Chevron's Cassation Appeal: C-1068).\n\n5.178.\n\nIn thus affirming the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Cassation Court did not review the merits of any of Chevron's allegations of fraud in the conduct of the Lago Agrio Litigation or the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment. However, in commenting upon the Cassation Court's lack of jurisdiction to adjudicate upon Chevron's allegations, the Cassation Court noted that these allegations were being heard in the pending RICO litigation in New York, USA.151\n\nC-1975, pp. 120-121.\n\n5.179.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether the Cassation Court (or, previously, the Appellate Court) was here effectively relinquishing to the US Courts the allegations of fraud advanced by Chevron to impugn the Lago Agrio Judgment. Although that appears to be the conclusion reached much later by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the RICO Litigation, the Tribunal does not here assume that this was in fact so.152 As regards the Cassation Court, that would have been inconsistent with its citation of the Ecuadorian Collusion Prosecution Act (the \"CPA\"; see above).\n\nIn the Second Circuit's Judgment, the Court decided: \"*In these circumstances, in which the district court has, on the claims of corruption, granted equitable in personam relief that does not invalidate the Ecuadorian judgment, and in which the Ecuadorian courts have expressly disclaimed jurisdiction to address the corruption claims and stated that the matter is preserved for adjudication in the United States courts, international comity is not an obstacle to the present District Court Judgment.*\" (C-2540, p. 116).\n\n***O: The Judgment of the Constitutional Court (2018)***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.180.\n\n*27 June 2018:* The Constitutional Court issues its Judgment on 27 June 2018,153 affirming the Judgment of the Cassation (National) Court (2013),154 following public hearings held on 16 July 2015 and 22 May 2018. The Constitutional Court declares that there is no violation of constitutional law, as alleged by Chevron; the Court rejects the Extraordinary Action of Protection made by Chevron; and it orders its judgment \"[t]o be recorded, published and enforced.\"155\n\nC-2551 (being the Parties' agreed translation from the Spanish original text into English).\n\nC-1975.\n\nC-2551, p. 148.\n\n5.181.\n\nThe Constitutional Court Judgment includes summaries of the submissions made by Chevron, as well as submissions made by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the ADF, the Office of the Respondent's Attorney-General and amici curiae. The Constitutional Court's reasons for its Judgment extend over some 100 pages (in Spanish), under nine Chapters.156 For present purposes, its principal reasons may be summarised as follows, with parts of its text meriting full quotation.\n\nC-2551, pp. 54 to 159. Chapter 1 (pp. 56ff); Chapter 2 (pp. 65ff); Chapter 3 (pp. 81ff); Chapter 4 (pp. 86ff); Chapter 5 (pp. 99ff); Chapter 6 (pp. 113ff); Chapter 7 (pp. 115ff); Chapter 8 (pp. 129ff); and Chapter 9 (pp. 132ff).\n\n5.182.\n\nUnder Chapter 1 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that there was no infringement of Chevron's \"right to be tried by a competent judge and in pursuance of the corresponding due process of law applicable to each proceedings\"; i.e. the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court and the Cassation Court.\n\n5.183.\n\nThe Constitutional Court affirms (inter alia) the decisions of these three courts that, for the purpose of their jurisdiction (\"competence\") and liability to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, Chevron had assumed Texaco's and TexPet's liabilities as a result of the \"merger\" between Texaco and Chevron in 2001. The Constitutional Court decides Chevron's jurisdictional objection, as follows:157\n\n*\"\u2026 the first item to be discussed within the question put forward above bears relationship with the fact of identifying the linkage or relationship that, according to the affected parties, existed between the defendant company Chevron Corporation and the company that operated in the contaminated area until the year 1992, named TexPet, and that, as determined in the lawsuit for environmental damage, was the person liable for the damage caused. Although this analysis may at first sight be related to the identification of the corresponding, lawful opposing party to this lawsuit, it actually seeks to establish above all a linkage allowing for the determination of the competence of the Ecuadorian judges. That is why, after a lengthy and well-founded analysis made by the lower court judge and ratified by the Court of Appeals and the Cassation Court, it was found that the Ecuadorian company TexPet was an affiliated company of the parent company Texaco Inc., and this latter company had in turn merged with the American company Chevron Corporation, a circumstance that within the corporate setting made it possible to establish that Chevron had undertaken any and all subsequent liabilities for the acts then performed by the company Texaco Inc. and its affiliated companies. As a matter of fact, this conclusion drawn by the trial court judge did not only make it possible to identify the corresponding lawful opposing party within the lawsuit, but it also allowed for the connection of this fact with the events taking place at the Court for the Southern District of New York before the date on which the lawsuit for environmental damages was filed, where within the case for environmental damages entitled Sequihua v. Texaco [the Aguinda Litigation], the American court found that the most appropriate forum to try said controversy was Ecuador, since the alleged damage was caused in said country, a circumstance that was accepted by Texaco Inc., thus opening the way for the Ecuadorian courts to enjoy sufficient competence to hear and settle any lawsuits filed on the grounds of environmental harm then caused by the company TexPet, whose parent company was Texaco Inc. and that now is, on the basis of the merger undergone by said company, according to the Ecuadorian courts, Chevron Corporation.\"*\n\nC-2551, pp. 62-63.\n\n5.184.\n\nFrom this and other passages, the Tribunal understands that, for the purposes of both jurisdiction and liability in the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Constitutional Court treats Chevron as if it were TexPet and Texaco and an active participant in their activities in Ecuador from 1964 onwards in the concession area. This understanding is confirmed by a later passage in the Constitutional Court's Judgment referring to the difficulty in establishing the timing of polluting incidents \"from the overall operation of the oil company for about 28 years.\"158 In context, this reference targets Chevron as the polluting \"oil company\" during the period of TexPet's concession from 1964 to 1992, a period of 28 years.\n\nC-2551, p. 110.\n\n5.185.\n\nUnder Chapter 2 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Judgment of the Cassation Court did not infringe \"the constitutional right to the effective judicial protection by failing to declare the procedural fraud alleged by Chevron.\"\n\n5.186.\n\nThe Constitutional Court describes Chevron's allegations of procedural fraud, as follows:159\n\n*\"\u2026 The actions that, in the words of the appellant, have caused a massive fraud or procedural fraud within the lawsuit brought against it, are: the plaintiffs' furtive collaboration in the ghostwriting of the trial court judgment, the influence they exerted for the appointment of the expert witness and the forgery of the expert witness' report that eventually did, whether directly or indirectly, serve as the basis for the assessment of the alleged environmental damage. On such bases, the appellant does hereby sustain that it has been proven in the various judicial stages that there has been a severely gross procedural fraud committed by the attorneys of the plaintiffs with the support of the judicial authorities, by means of the evidence produced at that moment, which was obtained by means of court orders issued in proceedings pursued in the United States of America.\"*\n\nC-2551, p. 67.\n\n5.187.\n\nThe Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court had no power to decide Chevron's allegations of procedural fraud. It states, as follows (with footnotes here omitted):\n\n*\"\u2026 it should be remarked that the cassation appeal does not constitute another trial stage in the court proceedings, wherein issues of fact previously reviewed by the trial court judges can be freely discussed; but rather, it is by means of the cassation appeal that the judges of the National Court of Justice, who are in charge of hearing such an appeal, undertake a review of the jurisdictional activity of the lower trial court judges, in respect of the application of the rules of law within their judgments or orders intended to close declaratory proceedings or trials. It is thereby ruled out any possibility that the cassation court judges may order the production and examination of evidence, make any assessment of the evidentiary elements or being to discuss any facts previously heard by the trial court judges, since any such actions would result in an infringement of judicial independence and legal certainty, duly guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador.\"*\n\n5.188.\n\nLater, the Constitutional Court concludes:160\n\n*\"\u2026 it is clear that nullity as a procedural concept corresponds to the grounds expressly set out in the Law, therefore, for such nullity to possibly take effect as an argument within a cassation appeal, it must, apart from observing the conditions established in section 3 of the Cassation Act - i.e. exert influence on the decision of the case or not having been legally validated - comply with the requirements established by Law, in the specific case at hand, the Code of Civil Procedure, as it is the currently applicable law at the time of said civil lawsuit; otherwise, the alleged error in the application or interpretation of procedural rules alleged by the company lodging this cassation appeal cannot be analyzed as a ground for the cassation appeal, insofar as it does not represent any materialization of an incurable nullity within the process, as stated by the National Court of Justice [the Cassation Court] in its ruling.*\n\n*This Court, based on the considerations expounded thus far, must specify that the appellant's allegations concerning the performance of fraudulent acts on the part of and attributable to its counterparty to these proceedings and the judicial authorities involved in trying the case, are not grounds or reasons expressly provided for in the Ecuadorian law as a valid foundation to argue and determine the nullity of the proceedings; otherwise, as analyzed further below and pursuant to the opinions of the National Court of Justice based on the appellant's arguments, the facts therein alleged would correspond to another type of conducts to be tried by means of the corresponding proceedings, rather than as a ground for procedural nullity. Therefore, as this is an appeal which is extremely formalistic and rigorous, the Cassation Tribunal is called on to strictly observe the legal regulations established in relation thereto, which in the case at hand have not been fulfilled, hence, there has been no concurrence whatsoever of any essential elements necessary for the judges of the National Court of Justice to find the appropriateness of the charges alleged by the appellant as grounds for nullity of the proceedings and for the very cassation appeal.*\n\n*In this respect, it can be noticed that the performance of judges when rendering the judgment subject to appeal is consistent with the nature of the cassation appeal and with the rules governing such subject matter, otherwise, to admit, as sought by the appellant, any argument as a ground for procedural nullity would confront us with a legal system in want of certainty in the application of legal rules and, therefore, inconsistent with the legal framework provided for by our Ecuadorian Constitution.*\n\n*On the other hand, as previously stated, the judges of the Cassation Court sustain within the decision subject to appeal that, should the procedural irregularities alleged by Chevron exist, the Ecuadorian law has already established the corresponding actions of administrative and criminal nature to punish such kind of conducts, notwithstanding the civil liabilities that may arise therefrom. The Cassation Tribunal considers that the arguments expounded by Chevron make reference to the commission of somehow collusive actions, a behavior for which, the judges explain, there is a specific regulation in the Ecuadorian law [Footnote 27 refers to the Collusion Prosecution Act] : likewise, the judged sustain [sic: \"judgment?] that by means of the arguments posed by the company lodging this cassation appeal, its counterparty's lawyers, expert witnesses and trial court judges are thereby being accused of having committed several crimes, an aspect which is found as inadmissible by the national justices within the context of the cassation appeal at hand. In furtherance of its stance, the appellant argues that the Cassation Tribunal's refusal to hear and remedy the procedural fraud it reported, constitutes an infringement of its constitutional right subject matter of this legal issue, which, in turn, has led Chevron to a status of deprivation of its right to judicial defense in the proceedings pursued against it.*\n\n*In this respect, this Court does hereby notice, in the first place, that the appellant's allegation in relation to the fact that the Cassation Tribunal refused to deal with the procedural fraud reported by the company Chevron, lacks every single foundation, since as stated and described in the foregoing paragraphs, the National Court of Justice actually analyzes the arguments proposed by means of the cassation appeal in relation to the performance of fraudulent acts within said judicial proceedings; in spite of this, the fact that the judges know the parties' allegations does not necessarily entail a favorable decision for either party's claims, as seems to be the appellant's intention, when stating that the cassation court judges infringe constitutional rights by not remedying the fraud reported by the appellant.\"*\n\nC-2551, pp. 75-77.\n\n5.189.\n\nFrom these and other passages,161 the Tribunal concludes that the Constitutional Court both received and understood the factual allegations of procedural fraud made by Chevron, including the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment; that these allegations were materially the same as the Claimant's factual allegations made by the Claimants in this arbitration; and that the Constitutional Court decided that both the Constitutional Court and the Cassation Court had no jurisdiction under Ecuadorian law to determine the truth or effect of such allegations upon the status of the Lago Agrio Judgment, including its enforceability and execution within and without Ecuador. (As to the Constitutional Court's reference to the Collusion Prosecution Act, the Tribunal returns to this issue later below).\n\nSee also C-2551, pp. 80 and 81.\n\n5.190.\n\nUnder Chapter 3 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not infringe \"the right to the due process of law as to the guarantee enshrined in [Article] 76, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Ecuadorian Republic.\"162\n\nArticle 76(4) of the Constitution provides: *\"In all proceedings determining rights and obligations of any kind, the right to due process shall be ensured, and it will include the following basic guarantees: 4. Evidence obtained or taken in violation of the Constitution or the law will have no legal validity and will lack probative value.\"*\n\n5.191.\n\nThe Constitutional Court concludes:163\n\n*\"Ultimately, this Court does hereby notice a series of allegations related to the field of evidence that, far from arguing a constitutional infringement, merely show a dissatisfaction with the assessment made not only by the judicial authority rendering the judgment under discussion herein, but also by the judges acting in the civil lawsuit; a circumstance that, pursuant to the previous findings of this Court, does not pertain to a constitutional sphere and as such, it should not be the subject matter of analysis within the context of this petition.*\n\n*Finally, it is necessary to point out that, once the arguments posed by the appellant with its intention to clearly show that the procurement of evidence occurred in violation of constitutional principles and rights have been analyzed, this Court has not found a clear and well-founded argument that may make it possible to acknowledge such kind of charges, a situation that, as expounded in the foregoing paragraph, would indeed constitute an element to be analyzed by this Court. In this line of thought, it is thus confirmed, based on the foregoing explanations, that the appellant itself expects a decision of the Constitutional Court on some aspects that are beyond the production and procurement of evidence referred to in Article 76, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador.\"*\n\nC-2551, pp. 84 and 85.\n\n5.192.\n\nUnder Chapter 4 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not violate \"the constitutional right to legal certainty in connection with the alleged existence of res judicata.\"\n\n5.193.\n\nThe Constitutional Court here considers Chevron's submissions regarding the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It concludes that the 1995 Settlement Agreement does not preclude the Lago Agrio Complaint because the Ecuadorian State, as a party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, did not represent or bind the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; and, since the 1995 Settlement Agreement is deprived of res judicata effects, there is no infringement of the constitutional law principle \"non bis in idem\" or double jeopardy.164 The Tribunal returns below to this part of the Constitutional Court's Judgment.\n\nC-2551, p. 99.\n\n5.194.\n\nUnder Chapter 5 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not violate \"the right to legal certainty contained in Article 82 of the Constitution of the Republic, based on the retroactive application of the 1999 Environmental Management Act [the EMA]\".\n\n5.195.\n\nThe Constitutional Court here considers that, in view of the values advanced by the substantive provisions of Ecuadorian law regarding the protection of the environment, including provisions in the Civil Code pre-dating the commencement of activities by Texaco and TexPet in Ecuador, there has not been any retrospective application of Ecuadorian law in the Lago Agrio Litigation that violates constitutional Law.\n\n5.196.\n\nThe Constitutional Court concludes (with footnotes here omitted):165\n\n*\"It is possible, therefore, to assert that no one has the acquired right to pollute or can claim the existence of a consolidated legal situation when his/her actions damaged the environment and also when there are collective environmental interests at stake. Under this logic, it is absolutely possible and sometimes necessary to enforce the retroactive application of the environmental regulations to the extent that it provides greater levels of protection.*\n\n*In light of the foregoing, it is the understanding of this Court that the application of the second paragraph of article 43 of the Environmental Management Act did not represent a breach of the right to legal certainty, as it addressed the constitutional principle of in dubio pro natura, which requires judges to apply the rule most favorable to nature in cases in which there are doubts about the rules to apply, and was able to protect the right to a healthy environment and nature in the best possible way.\"*\n\nC-2251, p. 112.\n\n5.197.\n\nFrom this and other passages, the Tribunal understands that the Constitutional Court is again treating Chevron as TexPet. For example, in a preceding passage, the Constitutional Court refers to \"Chevron\" refusing \"to repair the damage\", namely environmental damage caused by pollution incidents \"throughout the entire time\", being the term of TexPet's Concession Agreements from 1964 to 1992.166\n\nC-2551, p.111.\n\n5.198.\n\nUnder Chapter 6 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not breach \"the right to legal certainty contained in Article 82 of the Constitution of the Republic due to the retroactive application of the objective liability regime\".\n\n5.199.\n\nThe Constitutional Court concludes:167\n\n*\"The objective liability regime, reversal of the burden of proof, the principle of enforcing the rule most favorable to the protection of nature-related rights and the non-applicability of statute of limitations to environmental rights, configure the constitutional block to protect nature and these objectives were achieved with the application of the regulations by trial court judges and by the National Court of Justice, and this situation must be backed by this Constitutional Court.\"*\n\nC-2551, p. 115.\n\n5.200.\n\nThese rulings include the judgment of the former Supreme Court in the *Delfina Torres* case (cited above).168\n\nC-2551, p. 113.\n\n5.201.\n\nUnder Chapter 7 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not breach \"the constitutional right to legal certainty in relation to the principle of consistency of legal decisions.\"\n\n5.202.\n\nThe Constitutional Court concludes:169\n\n*\"\u2026 it is apparent that an impact on the environment has a direct effect on the culture of the indigenous communities that inhabit the area where pollution has occurred, as in the specific case of the damages caused in the Amazon. In such a way, having a redress mechanism that tends to remedy the cultural damage produced by environmental pollution caused by the appellant company [sic: Chevron] and as stated by the judge a quo, it is a complementary measure that contributes to redress for damages caused to the flora and fauna of the territory, which are fundamental elements for the development of life and cultural identity of the indigenous population that lived in the concession area. Therefore, this Court not only rejects the petitioner's argument but also considers that the redress ordered in the ruling to implement a community reconstruction and ethnic reaffirmation program is proper and in no way constitutes a measure that the plaintiffs did not request \u2026\"*\n\n*\"Therefore, this Court determines that the contested judgment does not infringe on the principle of non ultra petita applicable to judicial decisions, consequently, it being established that there is no infringement of the right to legal certainty.\"*\n\nC-2551, pp. 128 and 129.\n\n5.203.\n\nUnder Chapter 8 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not infringe \"the right to due process provided for in Article 76, Number 6 of the Constitution of the Republic\".170\n\nArticle 76(6) of the Constitution provides, in material part: \"*In all proceedings determining the rights and obligations of any kind, the right to due process shall be ensured, and it will include the following basic guarantees: (6) the law shall establish the proper proportionality between violations and criminal, administrative or other sanctions.\"*\n\n5.204.\n\nThe Constitutional Court concludes:171\n\n*\"\u2026 the principle of proportionality from the punitive sphere, as enunciated in the Constitution of the Republic, must be observed from the perspective that any imposition of excessive and unnecessary sanctions will also represent a restriction or arbitrary deprivation of rights. Circumstance that, in turn, imposes on the legislator the need to establish clear and tolerable limits for each sanction, since, being clear from the aforementioned Constitutional text, it is through the law that the proportionality between the infringement and the sanction will be guaranteed.*\n\n*However, returning to the analysis of the arguments made by the plaintiff [sic: the appellant, Chevron] in relation to the violation of the principle of proportionality, it is necessary to refer to the fact that the compensation for damages ordered by the judge of first instance and ratified by the appeal and cassation judges, irrespective of its origin, is aimed at economic compensation to those affected by the harmful consequences caused by the performance of a wilful act or malfeasance, in this particular case, environmental pollution.*\n\n*Therefore, it is evident that the compensation described as excessive and disproportionate that were ordered in the environmental damages case against Chevron, does not have a punitive nature, that is to say sanctioning, but rather a compensatory nature, that is, redress for the damage caused, as has been noted throughout this ruling and as described in the Environmental Management Act in force on the date the claim was filed.*\n\n*Therefore, it is clear that the principle of proportionality recognized in the Constitution as a guarantee of due process, responds to the idea of controlling and limiting the exercise of the punitive power the State has, avoiding the excessive use of sanctions that entail a deprivation or restriction of rights in order to protect valuable legal assets within society; circumstance not related to the case under analysis, since it has been evidenced that we are facing an economic recovery of the damage, but not before the application of a penalty that represses unlawful conduct.\"*\n\nC-2551, pp. 131 and 132.\n\n5.205.\n\nUnder Chapter 9 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court's Judgment did not violate \"the right to reasoning contained in Article 76, number 7(1) of the Constitution of the Republic\".172\n\nArticle 76(7)(1) of the Constitution provides, in material part: *\"In all proceedings determining rights and obligations of any kind, the right to due process shall be ensured, and it will include the following basic guarantees: (7) Persons' right to a defence shall include the following guarantees: (1) Decisions made by public authorities must be reasoned. Reasoning will be lacking if the decision does not state the legal rules or principles on which it is based and does not explain how they apply to the facts of the case. Administrative actions, decisions or rulings that are not duly reasoned will be considered void. The responsible public servants shall be sanctioned.\"*\n\n5.206.\n\nThe Constitutional Court listed Chevron's criticisms of the Cassation Court's reasoning, as follows:173\n\n*\"[The Cassation Court] Justice refused to rule on elements such as procedural fraud; the res judicata effect of the 1995 settlement agreement; violation of procedural rules related to competition; judicial inspections; essential error; lack of application of norms related to the assessment of evidence; violation of the dispositive and congruence principles; retroactive application of substantive aspects of the Environmental Management Act; illegal and untimely appointment of the judges who heard the appeal; and lack of reasoning in the appeal decision.\"*\n\nC-2551, p. 136.\n\n5.207.\n\nAs regards Chevron's allegations of procedural fraud, the Constitutional Court concludes, approving the Cassation Court's reasoning, as follows:174\n\n*\"Even if true, in the review of judgment, it can be seen that when the plaintiffs make allegations regarding procedural fraud within the second clause of Article 3 of the Cassation Act, the National Court of Justice provides a generic answer saying that '(\u2026) never identified any law in such allegations, nor has it ever shown how this affected the validity of these proceedings, and therefore such complaints amount to vague allegations, with no legal foundation (\u2026)'. However, further on, when analyzing specific allegations about fraudulent actions of lawyers, the fact that the judgment has not been drafted by the judge who heard the case; falsification of Calmbacher\u00b4s expert report; and the lack of impartiality and independence of the judges, the National Court of Justice makes three elements clear: 1) their lack of competence within civil appeal cases to recognize unproven, fraudulent acts; 2) the existence of specific procedural channels to prosecute reported fraudulent acts, and 3) the need for plaintiffs to present their accusations before the appropriate authority.*\n\n*In this sense, although there is no substantive ruling regarding alleged fraudulent acts, that is regarding whether the fraudulent acts existed or not, the National Court of Justice provides an answer based on the rules that regulate cassation appeals and causes for invalidity, concluding that allegations of procedural fraud were not only raised erroneously, but also demanded analysis to be made outside of its actual jurisdiction.\"*\n\nC-2551, p. 138.\n\n5.208.\n\nAs regards Chevron's jurisdictional objection, the Constitutional Court concludes, approving the reasoning of the Cassation Court, as follows:175\n\n*\"The National Court of Justice gives the following premises: 1) Chevron waived the jurisdiction of its domicile, and 2) Chevron submitted voluntarily to Ecuadorian competence; these circumstances are contrasted with the relevant procedural rules and the National Court of Justice arrives at the conclusion that, in effect, the judges that knew the cause of the case, possessed the competence and applied procedural rules adequately.*\n\n*In terms of the legal problem regarding competence, this Court has undertaken an analysis of the reasons that led the National Court of Justice to consider that the procedural rules had been applied and to justify the competence of the national judges in the case. From this analysis, the correct argumentation given by the National Court of Justice is confirmed in greater detail. From the forgoing, it is concluded that the judges of Cassation did indeed rule on the matter and did so in a substantiated manner.\"*\n\nC-2551, pp. 143 and 144.\n\n5.209.\n\nThe Constitutional Court also rejects Chevron's other allegations that the Cassation Court's Judgment lacks reasons or are irrational, including denial of a procedural opportunity to investigate essential mistakes in the expert evidence presented in the Lago Agrio Litigation, illegal appointment of judges who decided the appeal against the Lago Agrio Judgment, failure to apply norms concerning the evaluation of the evidence and evaluation of the res judicata effects of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n5.210.\n\nThe Constitutional Court Judgment was issued after the Track II Hearing, shortly before the Tribunal was to issue its award under Track II. In the circumstances, the Parties addressed the Tribunal on the effect of the Constitutional Court Judgment by their respective written submissions by letters dated 25 July 2018, pursuant to the Tribunal's Agreed Procedural Order of 19 July 2018.\n\n5.211.\n\nIn the Claimants' said submissions of 25 July 2018 (with footnotes here partly omitted), the Claimants contend (inter alia) as follows:\n\n(1) First, the Constitutional Court affirmed the Lago Agrio Judgment and failed to mitigate the denial of justice that ripened years ago. To the extent that Chevron's \"Extraordinary Action of Protection\" submitted to the Constitutional Court was a local remedy, so the Claimants conclude, it has been exhausted by the Claimants.\n\n(2) Second, the Constitutional Court refused to consider any of the evidence of fraud presented by Chevron.176 At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent quoted Article 94 of the Ecuadorian Constitution: \"An extraordinary action of protection is available against judgments or final orders by which Constitutional rights were violated by action or omission.\"177 Yet, according to the Constitutional Court, the Respondent's Appellate and Cassation Courts, seized with evidence that a party had bribed a first-instance judge and 'ghostwritten' that judge's judgment, are required to affirm that judgment; and that such judicial misconduct does not violate the Ecuadorian Constitution.\n\nInstead, so Chevron submits, the Constitutional Court fastened onto the Respondent's \"post hoc contrivance\" that a prosecution is required of Chevron under the Collusion Prosecution Action (CPA).178 The Claimants submit that this reasoning ignores the \"ultima ratio rule\"; and that a CPA action could not suspend enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment. The Claimants further submit that political reality in Ecuador means that no Ecuadorian judge would rule in Chevron's favour (as contended by the Claimants in their closing oral submissions at the Track II Hearing).179 In any event, as Chevron concluded at the Track II Hearing: \"If Ecuador is correct that its judicial system is powerless to address fraud on direct appeal or even to stay enforcement during the pendency of a CPA action, then its system falls below international standards\u2026.\".180\n\n(3) Third, as the Constitutional Court judgment records, an \"Oversight\" Council is currently deciding whether to remove certain judges involved in the Lago Agrio Litigation.181 The Council's chairperson filed an amicus brief before the Constitutional Court demanding that the Constitutional Court reject Chevron's action for protection. Chevron requested the Constitutional Court to delay its ruling on that demand until the judges' conflict was resolved.182 The Constitutional Court ignored Chevron's request.\n\n(4) Fourth, the Constitutional Court decided that the Lago Agrio Judgment is based exclusively on the diffuse right to live in a clean environment: 'the lawsuit [is] based on the right\u2026to live in a healthy environment, [which] is a constitutional and collective right\u2026.'.183 Moreover, the Constitutional Court expressly cited Article 19.2 of the former Constitution (which recognized that right).184\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Constitutional Court relied on two erroneous reasons to justify its disregard for the 1995 Settlement Agreement: (i) the 1995 Settlement Agreement did not 'refer' to 'third party' rights;185 whereas the Claimants submit that this reasoning ignores the express statements in Articles 1.3, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement that it releases claims based upon Article 19.2 of the Constitution;186 and (ii) the State of Ecuador could not represent this diffuse right187; whereas the Claimants submit that Article 19.2 expressly states that \"it is the duty of the State\" to enforce this diffuse right.188\n\n(5) Lastly, so the Claimants submit, the Constitutional Court's decision confirms that the denial of justice in the present case far surpasses that which occurred in *Loewen v USA* (2003).189 At the Track II Hearing, in support of its submissions on the Claimants' non-exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent contended that Mr Loewen's \"mortal sin\" was failing to petition the US Supreme Court regarding the Mississippi judgment.190 In response, the Claimants compared two fact patterns in its closing oral submissions at the Track II Hearing.191\n\nIn *Loewen*, so the Claimants submitted, the NAFTA tribunal found that an \"outrage\" had been committed in the conduct of a trial by court in Mississippi. What should one say if, instead, several appellate jurisdictions up to the US Supreme Court had applauded and endorsed the Mississippi judgment, that prosecutors in the USA had blankly refused to consider evidence of gross fraud, that the USA had indicated in formal submissions in a treaty arbitration (such as this arbitration) that the remedy which Mr Loewen was required to exhaust was available in a particular appellate court, that this appellate court then denied having any authority to consider the matter, and that a US Federal Court nevertheless endorsed the Mississippi judgment for enforcement abroad? The Claimants conclude that such facts would be even more 'outrageous' than the *Loewen* case; but that, today, those are the facts of the Respondent's conduct regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nC-2551, pp. 65-81.\n\nTrack II Hearing, D13; the Respondent' closing oral submissions - PowerPoint Presentation, at \u00a7 VI, slide 4, quoting Article 94 of the Ecuadorian Constitution.\n\nC-2551, pp 39-40, 76 and 79-80.\n\nTrack II Hearing, D12.2511-2512, 2576-2577 and 2592-2594.\n\nTrack II Hearing, D12.2392.\n\nC-2551, pp 43-44, referring to \"the Transitional Citizenship Participation and Public Oversight Council\".\n\nC-2551, pp. 43-44.\n\nC-2551, p. 91.\n\nC-2551, p. 92.\n\nC-2551, pp. 96 and 97.\n\nC-23: (Article 5.2: \"*claims \u2026 mean any and all claims \u2026 including but not limited to, causes of action under Article 19.2 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador\").* The full text of Article 5.2 and other material provisions of the 1995 Settlement Agreement are set out above, in Part III(d) of this Award.\n\nC-2551, p. 98.\n\nC-24 (\"*it is the duty of the State to ensure that this right will not be affected and to watch over the protection of nature.\").*\n\n*Loewen v USA*, CLA-44.\n\nTrack II Hearing, D1,236.\n\nTrack II Hearing, D12.2570-2571.\n\n5.212.\n\nIn the Respondent's said submissions of 25 July 2018 (with footnotes here partly omitted), the Respondent contends:\n\n(1) First, the Constitutional Court, as the highest Ecuadorian Court endowed with the authority to interpret Ecuador's Constitution, examined Chevron's claims and, after a thorough and well-reasoned analysis, concluded that the Appellate and Cassation Courts reviewing the Lago Agrio Litigation did not violate any of Chevron's constitutional rights. Chevron's claim that multiple Ecuadorian courts over the last decade were engaged in an elaborate conspiracy with former President Correa against Chevron has even less credibility, given that the Constitutional Court rendered its decision under a new administration long at odds with the former President, no longer in office.\n\n(2) Second, the Constitutional Court expressly found, like the Cassation (National) Court, that consideration of Chevron's extrinsic evidence of alleged fraud is precluded under Ecuadorian law.192 Rejecting Chevron's claim that the Cassation Court should have analysed \"the whole of evidence produced in order to prove the commission of the fraudulent acts\", the Constitutional Court repeatedly noted the limited scope of review of the Cassation Court, adding that Chevron had available to it alternative avenues of relief, including \"a specific regulation in the Ecuadorian law\" to redress \"collusive actions\", i.e., the Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA).193 The Respondent submits that Chevron cannot successfully prosecute its claims in this arbitration based upon the Ecuadorian Courts' alleged wrongdoings, whilst simultaneously ignoring the recourse afforded to litigants to redress such alleged wrongdoing in Ecuador.\n\n(3) Third, the Constitutional Court determined that Chevron's right to legal certainty was not infringed by the Ecuadorian Courts' failure to accept its res judicata defence (by which it claimed that the 1995 Settlement Agreement released it from liability for violations to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' constitutional right to live in a clean environment). The Constitutional Court found res judicata inapplicable because, whether the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' claims are collective or otherwise, there exists no identity of parties or object.194 The Constitutional Court instead quoted from and reaffirmed the admonition in Article 2362 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code that: \"[a] settlement only affects the parties to it.\"195 Further, the Constitutional Court found that the \"substantive law\" under which Chevron was tried was 'tort law under the Civil Code'.196 Because the Civil Code long pre-dated the Environmental Management Act (and the alleged introduction of collective rights in Ecuador), such Code provisions are individual in nature, rendering res judicata inapplicable.197\n\n(4) Fourth, Chevron has long sought to use this Tribunal as an appellate court by challenging various judicial rulings regarding the application of Ecuadorian law. To the extent the Constitutional Court examined some or all of these legal questions, the Constitutional Court's findings are dispositive. Its findings are reasonable and correct as a matter of Ecuadorian law and well within the ambit of the \"juridically possible\", using the Claimants' own terminology.198\n\n(5) Lastly, so the Respondent concludes, the Lago Agrio Litigation has always been about far more than Mr Donziger. It is also about \"the conduct of an oil company that put profit over the environment, leaving indigenous residents with substantive claims for real injuries.\" The rule of law requires redress for these indigenous plaintiffs, not overbroad protection for a multi-national giant well equipped to protect itself.\n\nC-2551, pp. 71, 75-81.\n\nC-2551, pp. 75-77.\n\nC-2551, pp. 95-96.\n\nC-2551, p. 97.\n\nC-2551, pp. 102,103.\n\nReferences to the Respondent's earlier written pleadings in Track II.\n\nCiting Professor Paulsson's Opinion dated 21 November 2008 in the Commercial Cases Arbitration, para. 70 [R-172].\n\n5.213.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses several particular features arising from the Judgment of the Constitutional Court.\n\n5.214.\n\nIt is clear from the Constitutional Court's Judgment, that the Constitutional Court was fully appraised of Chevron's allegations of procedural fraud in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment. It is equally clear that the Constitutional Court decided to leave these factual allegations unanswered, save to refer to its own lack of jurisdiction both to address these allegations and, if proven, to redress them (in addition to the same lack of jurisdiction in the Cassation Court).\n\n5.215.\n\nThe Constitutional Court decided that any alleged defects in the Lago Agrio Judgment, including the procedural fraud alleged by Chevron, could not be reviewed or decided by the Cassation Court or the Constitutional Court; the procedural laws governing their respective functions do not vest these Courts with any authority either to investigate or to redress such alleged defects; and, instead, Chevron's allegations should be the subject of criminal proceedings or proceedings under the Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA). Therefore, so the Constitutional Court concluded, there was no basis under Ecuadorian constitutional law for the Constitutional Court to decide that due process was violated by the decision of the Cassation Court not to take action in regard to such allegations.\n\n5.216.\n\nWith the Constitutional Court's Judgment, Chevron has no further appellate remedy within the Ecuadorian judicial system. Its action for protection before the Constitutional Court was its last possible opportunity to obtain judicial relief from the Ecuadorian Courts within the Lago Agrio Litigation. Save for a possible claim under the Collusion Prosecution Act (subject to a time-bar), Chevron has no judicial remedy under the Ecuadorian legal system against the enforcement and execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment under Ecuadorian law.\n\n5.217.\n\nIn several passages, the Constitutional Court emphasised the remedy available to Chevron under the Collusion Prosecution Act. The first passage cites the submission made by the Attorney General's Office, representing the Respondent:\n\n*\"Ecuador has made it clear that the courts that heard the Lago Agrio case declined to hear those allegations because these courts do not have jurisdiction. There is an appropriate and exclusive mechanism - the proceeding established by the Collusion Prosecution Act\u2014that Chevron should use, and it would allow the company to submit its evidence and rebut the arguments of the accused.\"199*\n\nC-2551, p.40.\n\n5.218.\n\nThe second passage accepts the submission made by the Attorney General's Office:\n\n*\"It is necessary to insist that the National Court of Justice has pronounced decisions about the procedural fraud alleged by Chevron, thereby establishing its lack of jurisdictional competence to determine the accuracy of the allegations posed by the appellant on lodging its cassation appeal, as this is neither the corresponding judicial stage nor the appropriate means to substantiate the criminal reports made by the appellant; thus, the judges pointed out that if the appellant considers that they were collusive actions or a commission of crimes, there exists the civil and criminal procedure, respectively, in order to try any behaviors so deemed as fraudulent. In this respect, this Court notices that the analysis conducted in the decision subject to appeal [the Cassation Court's Judgment] does not at all cause the appellant to be deprived of its right of judicial defense, since the Cassation Tribunal is not denying justice to the company lodging the cassation appeal, but rather, it is resolving the case in accordance with the rules governing the cassation appeal, thus leaving open the appellant's possibility to pursue any relevant actions intended for the facts being reported by means of the cassation appeal to be punished by more appropriate means.\"200*\n\nC-2551, pp. 79-80.\n\n5.219.\n\nThe third longer passage expands upon the Constitutional Court's reasons regarding the Collusion Prosecution Act. It has already been cited in full above under Chapter 2 of the Constitutional Court's Judgment.\n\n5.220.\n\nIt is clear from several passages in the Constitutional Court's Judgment that the Constitutional Court equated, as regards jurisdiction and liability, Chevron with TexPet and Texaco notwithstanding their respective different legal personalities. This determination approved the like decisions of the Cassation Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court and the Lago Agrio Court based upon Chevron's \"merger\" with Texaco in 2001, as regards both jurisdiction and liability. It also accords with the last of the submissions made by the Respondent in its letter of 25 July 2018, namely that the Lago Agrio Litigation was about \"the conduct of an oil company that put profit over the environment\" (cited above). That \"oil company\" is Chevron, even though Chevron was not involved in any activity in Ecuador under TexPet's concession.\n\n5.221.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal regrets its inability to follow the Constitutional Court's interpretation and application of the 1995 Settlement Agreement in regard to Chevron's liability under the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court and (save as to punitive damages) the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court.\n\n5.222.\n\nIn its Judgment, the Constitutional Court accepts the validity and effectiveness of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as between (inter alios) TexPet, Texaco, Chevron and the Respondent.201 The Constitutional Court also sets out the terms of Article 19.2 of the 1978 Constitution, being part of the release from liability expressly granted to Chevron by the Respondent under Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as also expressly set out).202 In describing the environmental rights for which Chevon was adjudged liable in the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation Courts), the Constitutional Court uses synonymously the terms \"diffuse right\" and \"collective rights\"; in the original Spanish text, respectively, \"un derecho difuso\" and \"los derechos colectivos.\"203 It is clear that the Constitutional Court treats the rights of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, as also decided by the Cassation, Lago Agrio Appellate and Lago Agrio Courts, as constituting a diffuse right, in the words of the Constitutional Court \"a constitutional and collective right\".204\n\nC-2551, p. 95.\n\nC-2551, pp. 92, 95 and 120.\n\nC-2551, pp 101, 109, 112 and 94.\n\nC-2551, p, 91.\n\n5.223.\n\nThe Tribunal re-states the distinction, as set out in its First Partial Award dated 17 September 2013, between an individual claim for personal harm by a Lago Agrio Plaintiff (not being a diffuse claim) and a diffuse (or collective) claim. The former is not affected by the 1995 Settlement Agreement; but the 1995 Settlement Agreement precludes the latter, expressly so in regard to Article 19.2 of the 1978 Constitution. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Constitutional Court's interpretation of Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement deprives that settlement of any practical meaning, making it a one-sided and open-ended commitment undertaken unilaterally by TexPet and Texaco, which (as decided by all four Ecuadorian Courts) Chevron inherited based upon its \"merger\" between Chevron and Texaco. The Tribunal re-states its reasons for its conclusion as also set out in its First Partial Award.\n\n5.224.\n\nIn the circumstances, on the basis of the submissions and expert evidence on Ecuadorian law adduced before the Tribunal in this arbitration, the Tribunal is driven to conclude, as regards the interpretation and application of the 1995 Settlement Agreement to the Lago Agrio Judgment, that the decision of the Constitutional Court is inconsistent with the effect that the Treaty requires to be given to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n***P: The Tribunal's Conclusions***\n-----------------------------------\n\n5.225.\n\nThe Tribunal finds proven, on the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the following facts based on the factual and non-forensic expert evidence set out above, in Parts IV and V of this Award. (For ease of reference, these factual and non-forensic expert issues are referred to as \"factual issues\").\n\n5.226.\n\n*The Ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgmen* t: The Claimants' factual allegation that the Judgment of the Lago Agrio Court was corruptly 'ghostwritten' lies at the heart of their present dispute with the Respondent. It is by far their gravest allegation in this case; and, if attributable to the Respondent, it is the origin of the injuries of which the Claimants now complain under the Treaty.\n\n5.227.\n\nThere is no direct factual evidence available in this arbitration proving definitively how and when the Lago Agrio Judgment was in fact written. There is, however, much circumstantial evidence, both factual and non-forensic expert evidence. Subject to the forensic issues considered in the next Part VI of this Award, that circumstantial evidence, in the Tribunal's view, proves by whom it was *not* written and why and by whom it *was* written, at least in substantial and material part.\n\n5.228.\n\nAs already indicated, the Tribunal declines to draw any adverse inference against the Respondent from the absence of Dr Zambrano as a witness in this arbitration. First, the Tribunal does not accept that Dr Zambrano's absence was improperly induced or otherwise influenced by the Respondent. Second, the Tribunal has benefited from the written testimony of Dr Zambrano in the RICO Litigation, which the Respondent (with the Claimants) agreed could be received by the Tribunal as if it were testimony adduced in this arbitration. On the other hand, whilst drawing no such adverse inference, the Tribunal confers no special advantage upon the Respondent arising from Dr Zambrano's absence as a witness in this arbitration. Whilst it thus rejects the Claimants' criticism of the Respondent for the missing piece of the jigsaw, it must nevertheless assess the Respondent's case (as also the Claimants' case) without that missing piece, mitigated by Dr Zambrano's testimony in the RICO Litigation.\n\n5.229.\n\nThis assessment starts with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, especially Mr Donziger and Mr Fajardo. The evidence before this Tribunal points clearly to the conclusion that they engaged in prolonged, malign conduct towards the Respondent's legal system generally and, particularly, the Lago Agrio Court in a manner that almost beggars belief in its arrogant contempt for elemental principles of truth and justice. It is pointless here to characterise such conduct any further, because these individuals are not the object of the exercise required for this Award under the Treaty applying international law. Such conduct, as related above, also speaks for itself. Moreover, others unknown were also involved in the 'ghostwriting' exercise. Whilst not attributable to the Respondent under international law, their collective misconduct nevertheless remains relevant because it was a necessary condition for what happened; but it was not the immediate cause of the Claimants' injuries.\n\n5.230.\n\nThat cause came from Judge Zambrano. The Tribunal considers that Judge Zambrano actively solicited a bribe from whichever side in the Lago Agrio Litigation would be willing to pay him for issuing a favourable judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Chevron refused his approaches; but certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives did not. It is not proven that Judge Zambrano did receive a monetary consideration actually paid to him before the issuance of the Lago Agrio Judgment. On a balance of probabilities, however, it is proven that the consideration was a promise to reward him financially at a later date from proceeds to be recovered from the enforcement against Chevron of the Lago Agrio Judgment. It is likely to be a reward that he will never see.\n\n5.231.\n\nBased on the circumstantial evidence, the Tribunal finds that Judge Zambrano did not draft the entirety of the Lago Agrio Judgment by himself, as he falsely testified on oath in the RICO Litigation. The Tribunal finds that Judge Zambrano, in return for his promised reward, allowed certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, corruptly, to 'ghostwrite' at least material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment (with its Clarification). These representatives included Mr Fajardo and Mr Donziger.\n\n5.232.\n\nExactly how that was done remains uncertain on the available factual evidence. It is clear that the 'ghostwriting' exercise was begun by these Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in about mid-2009; and it was well underway by the time of Judge Zambrano's return to the Lago Agrio Litigation in October 2010. For obvious reasons, Judge Zambrano was cautious; and these representatives were still more careful (albeit not careful enough). By that time, Chevron had formed strong suspicions as to what might be happening, even if Chevron could not prove it. That situation began to change when Dr Guerra disclosed what he knew to Chevron, later. However, Dr Guerra was largely excluded from this 'ghostwriting' exercise at the time; and his knowledge is limited.\n\n5.233.\n\n*Other Allegations:* The Tribunal turns to the Claimants' other factual allegations under seven headings: (i) the misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez; (ii) the misconduct of Mr Cabrera, as an auxiliary officer of the Lago Agrio Court; (iii) Judge Zambrano's improper connivance at Dr Guerra's ghostwriting of his court orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation (between October 2009 and March 2010); (iv) the Veiga-P\u0117rez Criminal Prosecutions; (v) the conduct of the Respondent's Government during the Lago Agrio Litigation; (vi) criminal investigations of 'fraud' in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Court's Judgment (comprising of the misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez and Mr Cabrera and the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment); and (vii) the Judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts in regard to 'fraud'. It is convenient to address these seven headings in reverse order.\n\n5.234.\n\n*The Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts* : As to (vii), as a factual matter, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court did not address in any significant manner the allegations made by Chevron of 'fraud' in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Court Judgment, in their respective Judgments of 3 January 2012 (with its Clarification Order of 13 January 2012), 12 November 2013 and 27 June 2018.\n\n5.235.\n\n*Criminal Investigations* : As to (vi), as a factual matter, notwithstanding the existence of at least prima facie evidence of 'fraud' in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Court's Judgment available to them, the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities were unwilling or unable to act in regard to such evidence in any significant and timely manner, before the Judgment of the Lago Agrio Court was declared enforceable by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court on 1 March 2012.\n\n5.236.\n\n*The Government's Conduct* : As to (v), the Tribunal does not consider proven the Claimants' factual allegation that the Respondent's Government played any material part in the Lago Agrio Judgment's 'ghostwriting' exercise.\n\n5.237.\n\nMoreover, at the Track II Hearing, Dr Guerra testified to his knowledge that the Government never sought to intervene or influence the judicial process in the Lago Agrio Litigation; and that \"the administration never butted in\" as regards the Lago Agrio Litigation.205 The Tribunal accepts the truth of his testimony. It is also consistent with the tactics adopted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives themselves: see Mr Prieto's cautionary advice by his email message of 14 January 2009, recited in Part IV above. Moreover, with the covert 'ghostwriting' exercise in place, these representatives did not need any intervention from the Government. It is also consistent with the evidence that Judge Zambrano solicited a bribe from Chevron in return for issuing a judgment adverse to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs (which Chevron rejected). That solicitation was not the result of any intervention by the Government.\n\nTrack II Hearing D3,623.\n\n5.238.\n\nAs regards other conduct by the Government, subject to (iv) below, it was inevitable that the Lago Agrio Litigation should arouse strong political, if not populist, passions at the highest level in Ecuador. Oil pollution and international oil companies often do. Hostile statements by politicians, practising domestic politics, do not necessarily amount to international wrongs. In this case, the Tribunal also bears in mind that the Aguinda and Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were all nationals of the Respondent; and, further, that the Aguinda and Lago Agrio Litigation gave rise to legal proceedings in the USA in which the Respondent was a party or putative intervener sharing, at times, an overlapping interest with its nationals. As such, a level of co-operation between them cannot be interpreted as improper collusion. Nor can it all be laid at the door of President Correa: such co-operation began before he first assumed office as President in January 2007.\n\n5.239.\n\n*The Veiga-P\u0117rez Criminal Prosecutions:* As to (iv), the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities actively co-operated with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in conducting criminal investigations and initiating criminal prosecutions against (inter alios) Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez as representatives of TexPet, for the purpose of disadvantaging Chevron's defence in the Lago Agrio Litigation based on the 1995 Settlement Agreement. These intermittent investigations and prosecutions from 2003 to 2011 were accompanied by vicious and unwarranted statements directed against each of them personally by senior members of the Government, including (from 2007) President Correa.\n\n5.240.\n\nAs already noted in Part IV, on 1 June 2011, these prosecutions were eventually discontinued by the Respondent's National Court, ostensibly without interference by the Respondent's Government. By that date, the Lago Agrio Judgment had been issued in favour of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs notwithstanding the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n5.241.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider proven that these criminal investigations or prosecutions had any causative link with the conduct of the Lago Agrio Litigation or the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. Indeed, after bribing Judge Zambrano, these representatives no longer needed to impugn the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with its related agreements) by means of these collusive criminal prosecutions.\n\n5.242.\n\n*Dr Guerra's Ghostwriting of Judge Zambrano's Court Orders* : As to (iii), during Judge Zambrano's first period as the judge presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation (October 2009 to March 2010), certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives corruptly paid Dr Guerra to 'ghostwrite' seven procedural orders for Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation, pursuant to which Judge Zambrano, knowing of such 'ghostwriting' by Dr Guerra, improperly issued such orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n5.243.\n\nThat misconduct is primarily to be attributed to these representatives and to Dr Guerra (who was then no longer a judge) and not thereby to the Respondent. There is no cogent evidence that any part of the bribes paid by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives for such orders was transmitted by Dr Guerra to Judge Zambrano. At the time, Judge Zambrano most probably knew of the payments to Dr Guerra. He could not have expected Dr Guerra to work for him *pro bono*. Judge Zambrano also knew that his delegating the drafting of procedural orders to Dr Guerra was illegal under Ecuadorian law.\n\n5.244.\n\nHowever, such misconduct by Dr Guerra took place at an earlier time than the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment during Judge Zambrano's return to the Lago Agrio Litigation (October 2010 - March 2011). This later 'ghostwriting' exercise was of a different and much greater order of misconduct by Judge Zambrano, and as the action of a judge within the scope of his professional duties it was plainly conduct attributable to the Respondent. It subsumed any earlier, lesser misconduct by Judge Zambrano. Whilst it is possible, or even likely, that the earlier misconduct by both Dr Guerra and Judge Zambrano formed a necessary condition for the subsequent 'ghostwriting' exercise by Judge Zambrano, it was not its cause.\n\n5.245.\n\n*Mr Cabrera* : As to (ii), Mr Cabrera, as an auxiliary officer of the Lago Agrio Court, (a) improperly favoured the case of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation and (b) improperly colluded with and permitted certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives and experts to write, covertly, the Cabrera Report, ostensibly in his name. Mr Cabrera, mendaciously, failed to act as an independent expert to the Lago Agrio Court, in violation of his oath to so. His misconduct resulted from the bribes corruptly paid to him by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives between mid-2007 to mid-2008.\n\n5.246.\n\nAs a factual matter, Mr Cabrera's improper conduct severely prejudiced the presentation of Chevron's case in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n5.247.\n\nAgain, whilst it is possible, or even likely, that this earlier misconduct formed a necessary condition for the subsequent 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment, it was not its cause. To the extent (as the Tribunal finds) that the Cabrera Report influenced in part the result of the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Tribunal considers that this factor forms part of the 'ghostwriting' exercise as a whole.\n\n5.248.\n\n*Judge Y\u00e1nez:* As to (i), Judge Y\u00e1nez (a) improperly terminated the procedure for the Judicial Inspections in the Lago Agrio Litigation, by order of the Lago Agrio Court dated 22 August 2006; and (b) improperly appointed Mr Cabrera as the Court's sole global assessment expert, by order of the Lago Agrio Court dated 19 March 2007. His misconduct resulted from the blackmail practised against him by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives from July 2006 onwards.\n\n5.249.\n\nAs a factual matter, the misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez severely prejudiced the presentation of Chevron's case in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Although it was a necessary condition for what happened subsequently in the Lago Agrio Litigation, his misconduct was not the cause of the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n5.250.\n\nThese conclusions are limited to the principal facts at issue between the Parties relevant to this Award. They remain subject to the Tribunal's consideration of the forensic issues considered in the next Part VI of this Award, as also to the other factual and legal issues considered in Parts VII and VIII of this Award.\n\n***PART VI*** - ***THE FORENSIC ISSUES***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n6.1.\n\nOn 20 and 21 May 2014, Ms Kathryn Owen, the Tribunal-appointed expert, travelled to Quito, Ecuador together with the Secretary to the Tribunal, Mr Martin Doe, and representatives of both Parties. Ms Owen made forensic images of two computers that had been identified by the Respondent as having been used by Judge Zambrano during the Lago Agrio Litigation (the \"Zambrano Computers\"). Identical copies of the forensic images of the Zambrano Computers were provided to Mr Lynch (of Stroz Friedberg) and Mr Racich (of Vestigant), the forensic expert witnesses appointed by the Claimants and the Respondent respectively in this arbitration.\n\n6.2.\n\nThese forensic images were collected and held, initially, by the Parties in strict confidence by order of the Tribunal. This order was respected by both the Claimants and the Respondent. Given the timing, these forensic images played no part in the RICO trial held in New York in October-November 2013.\n\n6.3.\n\nMr Lynch prepared a second report on the Zambrano Computers dated 15 August 2014 (\"Lynch ER 2\"). Mr Racich produced his analysis of the Zambrano Computers and his response to Lynch ER 2 in his second report dated 7 November 2014 (\"Racich ER 2\").1 Both expert witnesses filed third reports, on 14 January 2015 (\"Lynch ER 3\") and 16 March 2015 (\"Racich ER 3\").\n\nMr Lynch and Mr Racich had previously filed first expert reports that addressed Dr Guerra's computer and other electronic media.\n\n6.4.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing during their oral testimony, both experts gave short presentations and were cross-examined by the adverse Party(ies).2 Ms Owen attended that part of the Track II Hearing (Days 5 and 6); but she did not give oral or written evidence before the Tribunal then or later, apart from her Final Report and Revised Final Report of 5 February 2016 and 3 June 2016.\n\nThe transcript of their oral evidence is at D5,935 to D6.1284 of the Track II Hearing.\n\n6.5.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 40, Ms Owen considered the expert reports and oral testimony of Mr Lynch and Mr Racich, in order to identify: (i) any material points on which there was common ground between the technical testimony and conclusions of Mr Lynch and Mr Racich; (ii) any material points on which there was a difference between their technical testimony and conclusions; (iii) whether the differences arose from a difference in forensic analysis or whether they were attributable to non-technical facts; and (iv) any material conclusions put forward by Mr Lynch or Mr Racich which she would not characterise as matters of forensic analysis.3\n\nProcedural Order No. 40, para 1(a).\n\n6.6.\n\nMs Owen subsequently produced a draft report dated 18 December 2015, which was circulated to the Parties, but not to the Tribunal. This draft formed the basis for discussions between Ms Owen, Mr Lynch and Mr Racich in The Hague on 12 January 2016. In accordance with Procedural Order No. 40, Ms Owen's Final Report was circulated to the Parties and to the Tribunal on 5 February 2016.\n\n6.7.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Orders No. 404 and No. 415, the Parties submitted written comments on Ms Owen's Final Report on 4 March 2016.6 These comments7 were transmitted to Ms Owen, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 42.8 Further correspondence from the Parties was sent to Ms Owen in April and May 2016.9\n\nProcedural Order No. 40, para 3.\n\nProcedural Order No. 41, para 2.\n\nThe Claimants' letter of 4 March 2016; and the Respondent's letter of 4 March 2016.\n\nWith the exception of the last section (at pp. 16-17) of the Respondent's letter.\n\nProcedural Order No. 42, para 2.\n\nThe Claimants' letter of 27 April 2016; and the Respondent's letter of 2 May 2016.\n\n6.8.\n\nFollowing further consultation between Ms Owen, Mr Lynch and Mr Racich, on 3 June 2016 Ms Owen provided her final written responses on the Parties' comments and a Revised Final Report.\n\n6.9.\n\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 44, the Parties each filed (i) submissions on the significance of Ms Owen's Revised Final Report on 13 August 2016; and (ii) their reply submissions on 26 August 2016.\n\n6.10.\n\nThe Parties indicated to the Tribunal that they did not seek to examine Ms Owen at an oral hearing, pursuant to Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.10 In Procedural Order No. 46, given the Parties' joint decision, the Tribunal confirmed that it had decided not to question Ms Owen of its own motion also pursuant to Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.11\n\nThe Claimants' letter of 27 June 2016; Procedural Order No. 44, para 3.\n\nProcedural Order No. 46, para A.\n\n6.11.\n\nIn compliance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has received no private advice from Ms Owen.\n\n***B: Summary of Forensic Evidence***\n-------------------------------------\n\n6.12.\n\nOverall, it appears to the Tribunal from the expert reports and oral testimony of Mr Lynch and Mr Racich, and from the Revised Final Report of Ms Owen, that there are few, if any, material differences between the expert witnesses in relation to the forensic evidence that was retrieved from the Zambrano Computers, as distinct from their respective forensic opinions inferred from such evidence. The various points of disagreement between the expert witnesses arise from significant differences in the way in which Mr Lynch and Mr Racich have approached and interpreted that evidence.\n\n6.13.\n\nIn particular, there appears to have been a fundamental difference in the overall focus of the two experts, based upon their respective terms of reference. Mr Lynch's analysis (for the Claimants) appears to have been directed primarily at the question whether the available forensic evidence is consistent with Judge Zambrano's testimony at the RICO trial on his drafting of the Lago Agrio Judgment.12 Conversely, the focus of Mr Racich's analysis of the forensic evidence (for the Respondent) was directed at the possibility, or probability, that a third person or persons did not \"ghostwrite\" the Lago Agrio Judgment.13\n\nSee Lynch ER 2, p. 7, where Mr Lynch concluded that \"*In summary, the totality of the available forensic evidence is inconsistent in all material respects with Mr Zambrano's testimony describing how the drafting of the Ecuadorian Judgment occurred on the New Computer*.\"\n\nSee Racich ER 2, p. 3, where Mr Racich noted that \"*In my professional opinion, the evidence is more consistent with Mr Zambrano and his assistant writing the Judgment than it is with a third party writing the Judgment and giving it to Mr Zambrano for issuance at the beginning of February 2011*.\"\n\n***C: Judge Zambrano's Two Computers***\n---------------------------------------\n\n6.14.\n\nJudge Zambrano was issued with two Hewlett Packard (\"HP\") computers. The first (serial number MXJ64005TG) was manufactured and shipped by HP in 2006 (\"the Old Computer\"). The second (serial number MXL0382C3D) was manufactured in 2010 and purchased by the Judicial Council of Ecuador in November 2010 and available to Judge Zambrano from 26 November 2010 (\"the New Computer\").14\n\nLynch ER 2, pp. 8-9.\n\n6.15.\n\nIt will be recalled that the periods here under consideration are (i) from 21 October 2009 to 11 March 2010 and (ii) from 11 October 2010 to 4 March 2011 during which Judge Zambrano presided over the Lago Agrio Litigation. He issued the Lago Agrio Judgment and its Clarification on 9 February and 4 March 2011 respectively.\n\n6.16.\n\nWindows XP was installed on the Old Computer on 14 July 2010. Mr Lynch (with Stroz Friedberg) found evidence of files and folders that pre-dated 14 July 2010, which indicated that the Old Computer had contained a prior installation of Windows. On 14 July 2010, a significant amount of data was copied to the Old Computer, including 2,428 Microsoft Word documents. This data included files relating to the Lago Agrio Litigation. In Mr Lynch's view, this instance of bulk copying, combined with the evidence he had found of files and folders from a previous installation of Windows, was consistent with the reinstallation of the operating system, possibly as part of troubleshooting or maintenance.15\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 11.\n\n6.17.\n\nThe registered user name of the Old Computer at all times prior to March 2011 was \"CPJS\".16 Consequently, files saved using the Old Computer had the author or last saved name \"CPJS\".17\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1147 (Racich).\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,948 (Lynch).\n\n6.18.\n\nThe first user account, named \"HP\", was created on the New Computer on 25 November 2010. Files saved by the New Computer had the author or last saved name \"HP\".18 The first apparent use of this account was on 7 December 2010. There was no evidence of any bulk transfer of documents to the New Computer prior to the issuance of the Lago Agrio Judgment on 9 February 2011.19\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,948 (Lynch).\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 12.\n\n***D: The Development of the Lago Agrio Judgment's Text***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.19.\n\nMr Lynch (with Stroz Friedberg) carried out searches on the Old and New Computers for words and phrases from the Lago Agrio Judgment. On the Old Computer, Mr Lynch identified multiple copies of two files \u2013 \"Providencias.docx\" and \"Caso Texaco.doc\" \u2013 which contained text which was also found in the Lago Agrio Judgment.20 Subsequent versions of the \"Providencias.docx\" and \"Caso Texaco.doc\" files were subsequently saved on the Old Computer.21 No documents containing text of the Lago Agrio Judgment were recovered from the New Computer.22\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 27.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 25-26.\n\n6.20.\n\nThe distinction between the date of a document's first creation, and the date(s) on which it is subsequently saved, is important. The two expert witnesses agree that the earliest recoverable instance of \"Providencias.docx\" was created on the Old Computer on 11 October 2010.23 (On that date, 11 October 2010, Judge Zambrano formally resumed his role as the presiding judge hearing the Lago Agrio Litigation). The experts were not able to recover a version of \"Providencias.docx\" which had been last saved on or around 11 October 2010. Accordingly, they were unable to analyse the content of the document as it stood when it was created.24\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 27-28; Racich ER 2, para 10; Track II Hearing D5.1146 (Racich).\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 28.\n\n6.21.\n\nHowever, Mr Lynch noted that early versions of \"Providencias.docx\" contained a separate section of text, not related to the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment. He searched for this section of text and found it replicated in a document called \"Providencias.doc\", which had been transferred to the Old Computer as part of the bulk transfer that had occurred on 14 July 2010.25 It is not known, however, whether this document \"Providencias.doc\" contained any Judgment text at the time it was transferred to the Old Computer or at the time that it was used to create \"Providencias.docx\". (As at 14 July 2010, Judge Zambrano was not assigned to hear the Lago Agrio Litigation: it remained before Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez since 12 March 2010).\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 29.\n\n6.22.\n\n*The 21/12 Providencias:* The earliest version of \"Providencias.docx\" that the experts were able to recover was dated 21 December 2010 (\"the 21/12 Providencias\"). Between 11 October 2010 and 21 December 2010 (a period of 71 days), the 21/12 Providencias was saved 286 times and had been open for approximately 35 hours.26 The Tribunal notes that the 21/12 Providencias copied text from the Unfiled Moodie Memorandum and the Unfiled Erion Memorandum (both citing foreign, English language materials).\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\n6.23.\n\nThe 21/12 Providencias contained 42% of the final text of the Lago Agrio Judgment (about 80 pages, over pages 1 to 107 of the Judgment);27 and 94% of its text was unchanged in the Judgment.28 Mr Racich calculated that this would equate to a work rate of approximately 1 page per day during this period, if the work were evenly spaced. Mr Lynch, however, noted that, during this period, the 21/12 Providencias had been open for approximately 35 hours (the edit time).29\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 13 suggests the text at this stage was 78 pages long. Lynch (Track II Hearing D5,950) puts it at 81 pages.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\n6.24.\n\nFocussing on the edit time, Mr Lynch calculated that the text of the 21/12 Providencias would be typed at a much higher rate of approximately 26 minutes per page.30 Mr Racich agreed, in cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, that, if it was assumed that someone was typing the document during every minute that it was open during this period, it followed that the text was entered at a rate of less than 30 minutes per page.31\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 17.\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1257 (Racich).\n\n6.25.\n\nMr Lynch testified in his second report that the 21/12 Providencias contained formatting differences which were consistent with text having been copied and pasted from other documents.32 Mr Racich does not appear to contest that there were formatting differences in this document (although, as discussed below, Mr Racich does not accept that this evidence is necessarily consistent with text being provided to Judge Zambrano by third persons).33\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 10.\n\n6.26.\n\n*The 28/12 Providencias:* The next recoverable version of \"Providencias.docx\" was a version that was last saved on 28 December 2010 (\"the 28/12 Providencias\"). Again the two experts appear to agree on the metadata of this version of the document; but they interpret it in different ways. Mr Lynch found that between 21 and 28 December 2010, the 28/12 Providencias was saved 29 times and was open for approximately 17.5 hours. He further testified that this version of the document contained 66% of the final text of the Lago Agrio Judgment (over pages 1 to 154 of the Judgment).34 96% of its additional text was unchanged in the Judgment.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\n6.27.\n\nOn this basis, Mr Racich calculated that 45 pages had been added to the 28/12 Providencias in this period at a rate of approximately 7 pages per day.35\n\nRacich ER 2, para 15.\n\n6.28.\n\nAgain, Mr Lynch pointed out that this calculation did not take account of the edit time: given that the document was only open for 17.5 hours during this period, the additional text would have been added at an average rate of 27.5 minutes per page.36 That calculation assumes that someone was typing text into the document for every single minute that the document was open during this period.37\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 17. Mr Lynch suggested, at Lynch ER 3, p. 20, that 38 pages of Judgment text were added to the 28/12 Providencias.\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,951 (Lynch).\n\n6.29.\n\nMr Lynch noted that this document, like the 21/12 Providencias, contained formatting differences that were, in his view, consistent with text having been copied and pasted from other sources.38 Mr Racich suggested that it was likely that part of this additional text \"originated in another document on Mr Zambrano's computer, and that the user copied that text into the Providencias document.\" However, Mr Lynch analysed the Microsoft Office Session logs (\"the OSession Logs\") to assess how long Microsoft Word had been active.39 The OSession logs indicate that, in the period between 21 December and 28 December 2010, Microsoft Word was active for 18.3 hours \u2013 that is just 52 minutes longer than the time for which the 28/12 Providencias was open.40 In cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, Mr Racich accepted that the OSession logs indicated that, if someone had been working on any different document on Judge Zambrano's computers during the period between 21 and 28 December 2010, they had done so for less than an hour.41\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 24.\n\nThe full OSession logs for Microsoft Word for both the Old and New Computer between 14 July 2010 and 26 June 2013 are listed at Lynch ER 2, Exhibit 85.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 20.\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1252-1253 (Racich). Mr Racich commented that the OSession logs could be incomplete, although he agreed that they would only be incomplete if something \u2013 such as a crash on Microsoft Word \u2013 had happened. In his third report, Mr Racich suggested that there were a number of reasons why the OSession logs might not be accurate, for instance if the programme crashed, the power went out or if Word froze (Racich ER 3, para 20).\n\n6.30.\n\nIn his third report, Mr Lynch also explained that he had searched all the instances of \"Caso Texaco.doc\" for any of the text that was added to the 28/12 Providencias and did not find any of that text.42\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 22.\n\n6.31.\n\n*The 19/01 Caso Texaco:* The next document containing Judgment text, which Mr Lynch was able to recover, was a document named \"Caso Texaco.doc\" (\"the 19/01 Caso Texaco\"). This document had been created on 20 October 2009 and last saved on 19 January 2011.43 The 19/01 Caso Texaco contained 11% of the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment (over pages 154 to 178). 97% of its additional text was unchanged in the Judgment.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 33, Table 16.\n\n6.32.\n\nNeither the previous recoverable version of \"Caso Texaco.doc\" (last saved date 5 January 2011) nor the subsequent recoverable version (last saved date 4 March 2011) contained any text of the Lago Agrio Judgment. The 19/01 Caso Texaco had been saved 16 times and had been open for approximately 11.5 hours since 5 January 2011.44 This version of \"Caso Texaco.doc\" was last saved on the Old Computer.45 However, Mr Racich emphasised that other versions of \"Caso Texaco.doc\" were opened and edited on both the Old and New Computers.46\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 25.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 33.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 27.\n\n6.33.\n\nMr Racich suggested that the forensic evidence relating to the 19/01 Caso Texaco was consistent with a person copying text from that document and pasting it into the draft of the Lago Agrio Judgment (i.e. \"Providencias.docx\") some time before 19 January 2011.47 Mr Lynch, however, noted that none of the Judgment text found in the 19/01 Caso Texaco was added to the 28/12 Providencias48 (although for the reason elaborated below, there is no evidence to indicate whether or not the text from the 19/01 Caso Texaco was added to \"Providencias.docx\" between 28 December 2010 and 19 January 2011).\n\nRacich ER 2, para 26.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 22.\n\n6.34.\n\nIn cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, Mr Lynch accepted that Judge Zambrano's computers contained documents in both Bookman Old Style and Times New Roman fonts and that the blocks of text in \"Providencias.docx\" could have been cut and pasted from another document on Judge Zambrano's computer.49 However neither expert was able to shed any light on where the cut-and-pasted text may have come from. Mr Racich emphasised that there was no forensic evidence to suggest that any version of the 21/12 Providencias was provided to Judge Zambrano by a third person.50\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1074-1075 (Lynch).\n\nRacich ER 2, para 10.\n\n6.35.\n\n*21/01 Providencias:* On 21 January 2011, \"Providencias.docx\" was saved using the \"saved as\" function, which reset the edit time and revision count (\"the 21/01 Providencias\"). There was no recoverable temporary file showing the document's content at that date51 Accordingly, it was not possible for either expert to determine how many changes were made to the document during the period from 28 December 2010 to 21 January 2011, or for how long it was edited during this period.52\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 25.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 17.\n\n6.36.\n\n*The Lago Agrio Judgment:* As already indicated, the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued by Judge Zambrano on 14 February 2011. No final draft of the Judgment was found on the Zambrano Computers.\n\n6.37.\n\n*The 04/03 Providencias:* The earliest recovered version of any document containing all of the Judgment text was a version of \"Providencias.docx\" found on the Old Computer, which had been last saved on 4 March 2011 (\"the 04/03 Providencias\").53 As well as the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment, it contains the Clarification Order issued on 4 March 2011.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 6.\n\n6.38.\n\nMr Lynch suggests that it is odd that no \"final\" draft of the Lago Agrio Judgment was recovered before 14 February 2011. He testified that, in the context of a document which has ostensibly taken many months of work, \"it is common, based on my experience, for someone to create a backup copy or to save the final copy as a new 'final' version of the document, particularly before using the same file to create other documents (as is the case with Providencias).\"54\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 32.\n\n6.39.\n\nHowever, as Mr Racich pointed out, this factor is not conclusive: \"The fact that no backup of the Judgment dated 14 February, 2011 can be found on the Zambrano hard drives shows that Mr Zambrano may not have followed best practices to protect his work. In my experience, this is not evidence of ghost-writing.\"55\n\nRacich ER 3, p. 10.\n\n6.40.\n\nBetween 21 January and 4 March 2011, the 04/03 Providencias had been saved 124 times and had been open for approximately 58.3 hours. This version of the document contained 99%56 of the final text of the Lago Agrio Judgment, together with a further 24 pages comprising a version of the Clarification Order.57\n\nIn cross-examination, Mr Lynch accepted that the substance of the 04/03 Providencias was identical with the Lago Agrio Judgment: the only difference between the two documents is that former is missing the signature and the heading (Track II Hearing D5.1053).\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 25.\n\n6.41.\n\nIn the light of this evidence, Mr Lynch concluded that the forensic evidence was inconsistent with Judge Zambrano's testimony in the RICO Proceedings, namely that the Lago Agrio Judgment was typed by himself and Ms \"C\", exclusively on the New Computer.58\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 25.\n\n6.42.\n\nMr Racich disagreed with Mr Lynch. He explained that the hard drive of the Old Computer was \"mapped\" on the New Computer. As a consequence, a user of the Old Computer could access and edit files saved on the New Computer whilst working on the Old Computer, and vice versa.59 On this basis, so Mr Racich testified, Judge Zambrano's testimony may have been based on a misunderstanding: if he was sitting at the New Computer, he may have assumed that the files were being saved on to the New Computer. Mr Racich also indicated that the metadata (the Author and Last Saved fields) were not conclusive, since no information is stored about which computer saved the file between its creation and its last save.60\n\nRacich ER 2, para 39.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 40.\n\n6.43.\n\nMr Lynch, however, reiterated in his oral testimony at the Track II Hearing that: \"\u2026 all of the files with Judgment text were saved by CPJS [the user name of the Old Computer], showing that someone was using the Old Computer, not the New Computer.\"61 In his third report, Mr Lynch explained: \"\u2026 all of the 'several successive versions' of Ecuadorian Judgment text contained in Providencias and the January 19 Caso Texaco document were saved by the Old Computer and not through any 'mapping' by the New Computer. Had any of those versions been saved using the New Computer the metadata for those versions would reflect that they had been saved using the New Computer.\"62\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,948 (Lynch).\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 30.\n\n6.44.\n\nIn summary, to the Tribunal's understanding, the forensic evidence which the two experts were able to extract from the Zambrano Computers indicates the following:\n\n6.45.\n\nBetween 11 October 2010 and 4 March 2011, the recovered files that contained Judgment text (the 21/12 Providencias; the 28/12 Providencias; the 19/01 Caso Texaco; and the 04/03 Providencias) were open for a combined total of at least 162.3 hours. It is not known how long the 21/01 Providencias had been open.\n\n6.46.\n\nBetween 11 October 2010 and 4 March 2011, \"Providencias.docx\" was saved at least 439 times on Judge Zambrano's Computers.63 Again, it is not known how many times the 21/01 Providencias was saved.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 10.\n\n6.47.\n\nBetween 11 October 2010 and 14 February 2011, Microsoft Word was open for (at least) 198 hours on the Old Computer and (at least) 36 hours on the New Computer.64\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 20.\n\n6.48.\n\nThe formatting differences in the text are consistent with blocks of text being cut or copied and pasted into the Lago Agrio Judgment from other documents, but there is no way of knowing forensically where those blocks of text came from.\n\n***E: The \"Unfiled Materials\"***\n--------------------------------\n\n6.49.\n\nMr Lynch, in his first report, testified that the Final Judgment contained text and errors that did not exist in the laboratory results filed with the Lago Agrio Court but which did exist in the \"Unfiled\" Selva Viva Database (being Material No 8 considered in Part V above).65 Dr Leonard's expert report had further identified blocks of text in the Lago Agrio Judgment that were identical, or almost identical, to text found in documents which were not found in documents filed with the Lago Agrio Court (referred to by Mr Lynch as \"the Plagiarised Documents\", but the Tribunal uses the term \"Unfiled Materials\").\n\nLynch ER 1, pp. 20-30.\n\n6.50.\n\nFor his second report, Mr Lynch was asked to identify whether any of the \"Plagiarised Documents\" and/or the text and errors from the Selva Viva Database existed on either of Judge Zambrano's Computers.66\n\nLynch ER 2, pp. 16ff.\n\n6.51.\n\nMr Lynch generated search terms from the blocks of text identified in Dr Leonard's expert report. He then searched the Old Computer and the New Computer using those search terms, to identify whether such text existed in any documents (other than documents containing text of the Lago Agrio Judgment). This search only identified a single Excel file: INDICE DE CUERPOS JUICIO 002-2003.xlsx (\"the Zambrano Index Summary\"), which appeared to have some connection with the unfiled January and June Index Summaries (being Material No 6 considered in Part V above).\n\n6.52.\n\nThe earliest created copy of the Zambrano Index Summary was found on the Old Computer. It was copied to the Old Computer on 6 January 2011. However, the last saved date for all copies of this document was 12 February 2010 (whereas the last saved date for the January Index Summary and the June Index Summary was January and June 2007 respectively).\n\n6.53.\n\nMr Lynch compared the Zambrano Index Summary with the January and June Index Summaries examined in Dr Leonard's expert report. The latter contained five worksheets, whereas the version found on Judge Zambrano's computers contained only the first worksheet. Furthermore, there were notable differences between the version of the first worksheet found on Judge Zambrano's computers and the version contained in the January and June Index Summaries.67 Mr Lynch also reviewed the Zambrano Index Summary to see whether it contained all three instances of the text identified as plagiarised in Dr Leonard's Report. It contained only the first two instances.68 The metadata of the three versions of the Index Summaries (i.e. the June and January Index Summaries analysed by Dr Leonard and the Zambrano Index Summary) indicated that all three share the same Created Date and Author; but the metadata for all other fields is different.\n\nLynch ER 2, pp. 18-19.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 20.\n\n6.54.\n\nMr Lynch therefore concluded, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that:\n\n(a) All the versions of the Index Summaries were generated from the same original document created in January 2007 but were then separately edited (this date long preceded Judge Zambrano's first assignment to the Lago Agrio Litigation, beginning in October 2009);\n\n(b) The Zambrano Index Summary does not contain all of the plagiarised text which appears in the Final Judgment; and\n\n(c) None of the other plagiarised documents were on either of Judge Zambrano's computers.69\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 21.\n\n6.55.\n\nIn his second report, Mr Lynch also searched for data irregularities in the laboratory results collated in the Selva Viva Data Database. He could not identify any references to these on either of Judge Zambrano's Computers, except in documents containing text from the Judgment.70\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 21.\n\n6.56.\n\nBoth the Index Summaries and the Selva Viva Database are Microsoft Excel (electronic) documents. Mr Lynch therefore analysed the Microsoft \"OSession Logs\" to determine whether Microsoft Excel had been used on Judge Zambrano's Computers. He found that the OSession Logs record that, between October 2010 to March 2011, Excel was only used on the Old Computer and was only active for a total of four minutes: for two minutes on 18 October 2010; for one minute on 4 November 2010; and for one minute on 31 January 2011.71\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 22.\n\n6.57.\n\nMr Lynch also considered how long it would have taken to calculate the percentages which are contained within the Unfiled Selva Viva Database. He concluded that it would not have been possible, in the four minutes of recorded activity in Microsoft Excel, either to (i) derive the statistics appearing in the Lago Agrio Judgment from the unfiled Excel spreadsheets; or (ii) copy the other Excel data from the \"Plagiarised Documents\" appearing in the Lago Agrio Judgment.72\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 23.\n\n6.58.\n\nIn his second report, Mr Racich did not address in depth Mr Lynch's analysis of the \"Plagiarised Documents\", although he did question Mr Lynch's analysis of the usage of Microsoft Excel and, in particular, his reliance on the OSession logs. Mr Racich noted that Mr Lynch had not provided any evidence to support the assumption that an OSession log entry is created every time a Microsoft Office product is opened or whether the logs accurately record Microsoft Office usage.73\n\nRacich ER 2, para 72.\n\n6.59.\n\nIn his third report, Mr Lynch reiterated that \"None of the Plagiarized Documents that served as sources of text for the Ecuadorian Judgment were on the Zambrano Computers\"; and that \"Mr Racich offers no analysis to account for the source of that plagiarized text in the Ecuadorian Judgments.\"74\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 6.\n\n6.60.\n\nMr Racich responded to this criticism in his third report. He explained that he was informed that documents in the Lago Agrio Litigation were generally not filed electronically. On this basis, he concluded that there are no \"authorship conclusions to be drawn from the absence of these documents on the Zambrano hard drives. Instead, the fact that the documents are not present electronically indicates only that Mr Zambrano did not have electronic copies of the documents. I see no reason why Mr Zambrano could not have copied these portions of the Judgment from filed, paper copies of these documents.\"75 Mr Racich explained that he did not address this point, as he did not consider it a matter of computer forensics for the two experts.76\n\nRacich ER 3, para 31.\n\nRacich ER 3, para 32.\n\n6.61.\n\nMr Lynch, in his third report, referred to the suggestion (in the Respondent's Supplemental Counter-Memorial) that \"many additional documents were submitted on CDs and DVDs.\" Mr Lynch analysed the Old and New Computers and found that the only evidence of a CD or DVD being accessed on either the Old or New Computer between October 2010 and March 2011 was on 25 November 2010, when a user on the New Computer opened a disc called \"My Disc\".77 Mr Racich concluded, in his second report, that \"My Disc\" appeared to be \"related to the IT Department's set up of Microsoft Office on Mr Zambrano's New Computer\".78 Mr Lynch testified that: \"There is no other forensic evidence of access to a CD or DVD between October 2010 and March 2011 on either of the Zambrano Computers.\"79\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 9.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 61.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 9.\n\n6.62.\n\nIn relation to the Unfiled Selva Viva Database, Mr Lynch noted in his third report that the evidence shows that text and statistics from this document were added to \"Providencias.docx\" between 21 December 2010 and 28 December 2010. However, the OSession logs for Microsoft Excel show that Excel was not opened during that period on either of the Zambrano Computers.80 In this third report, Mr Lynch reiterated his assessment that \"it is not reasonably possible for someone to accurately calculate the statistics from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation without having access to the data in Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet or database program.\"81 Mr Lynch found no evidence on the Zambrano Computers of any program (other than Excel) that could have been used to calculate the statistics. He therefore concluded that \"the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation spreadsheet document from which the text was plagiarized must have been available to the drafter in electronic form and accessed using Microsoft Excel. Yet there is no evidence that the Unfiled Selva Viva Database was available on the Zambrano Computers or that Microsoft Excel was used during the time period this text was inserted into Providencias.\"82\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 10.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 10.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 10.\n\n6.63.\n\nIn response to Mr Racich's criticism about his reliance on the OSession logs, Mr Lynch stated that his second report had described how and when OSession logs are created, the data they track and limitations on the analysis of those logs. Mr Lynch testified that he had performed extensive testing of the log files (with Stroz Friedberg). He appended, as Appendix 1 to his third report, an additional discussion of the testing performed by Stroz Friedberg.83\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 11.\n\n6.64.\n\nIn his third report, Mr Racich stated that Mr Lynch's testing document did not support Mr Lynch's conclusions about the amount of time that Office products were open on Judge Zambrano's Computers. In particular, Mr Racich observed, it did not explain how the logs function (or fail to function) in many cases and that the analysis performed by Mr Lynch did not preclude other scenarios where Office products could have been in use for a longer period than the logs suggest.84\n\nRacich ER 3, para 20.\n\n6.65.\n\nIn response to Mr Lynch's conclusions that: (i) Microsoft Excel must have been used to calculate the statistics in the Lago Agrio Judgment and (ii) because there is no evidence of usage of Microsoft Excel in the relevant period, Mr Racich concluded that the allegation that Judge Zambrano could not have authored the Judgment was overstated. Mr Racich testified: \"On this evidence, it cannot be said either that the allegedly unfiled Selva Viva Database is the source of statistics in the Judgment or that Mr Zambrano did not simply copy those statistics from a former judge's notes. There may be still other explanations. All we can say is that the computer forensic evidence we have at present cannot answer the question.\"85\n\nRacich ER 3, para 41.\n\n6.66.\n\nIn his testimony at the Track II Hearing, Mr Lynch agreed that whether or not the \"Plagiarised Documents\" were in the court record was not a question of computer forensics; but he emphasised that the question whether or not someone had used Excel was a question for computer forensics. He reiterated his opinions that: (i) someone must have used Excel to calculate the statistics which appeared in the Lago Agrio Judgment; (ii) the naming and data irregularities were copied into \"Providencias.docx\" between 21 and 28 December 2010; but (iii) Excel (the program which would be used to open the database) was not used on either of Judge Zambrano's Computers during that period.86\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,959- 960 (Lynch).\n\n6.67.\n\nIn cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, it was put to Mr Lynch that another judge at the Lago Agrio Court could have calculated the percentages used in the Lago Agrio Judgment at an earlier date, given that the Judicial Inspections, from which the data was taken, had been suspended or completed by the end of 2006. Mr Lynch answered that he did not know if an earlier judge at the Lago Agrio Court had calculated the percentages, but he confirmed his expert opinion that, if that had been the case, that judge would have had to calculate them using a dataset that exactly double and triple counted the samples in the same way as the Selva Viva Database.87\n\nLynch, Track II Hearing D5.1111 (Lynch).\n\n6.68.\n\nIn his cross-examination, at the Track II Hearing, Mr Racich was asked about possible explanations for the calculation of the statistics in the Selva Viva Database. In particular, it was suggested that the calculations might just as easily have been made by Mr Fajardo as by a former judge of the Lago Agrio Court. Mr Racich confirmed that he did not know one way or another; and he agreed that it could have been anyone who had access to an electronic copy of the Selva Viva Database or the calculations.88\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1205 (Racich).\n\n6.69.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing,89 Mr Lynch testified that the unfiled Selva Viva Database (in Excel format) was over 19 columns wide and over 65,000 rows long. It would extend to thousands of pages if printed in hard copy, and, therefore, unusable in paper form for any practical purpose. He also testified that it contains peculiar information, naming conventions, irregularities and statistical factors that appear in the Lago Agrio Judgment that do not appear in the filed lab results which it purports to compile. Yet, he continued, the Selva Viva Database could not have been used on the Zambrano Computers to draft the Lago Agrio Judgment because, according to the Microsoft Office logs, Excel was only opened for 4 minutes between October 2010 and March 2011. Moreover, it was not opened at all during the period from 21 December to 28 December 2010 when its peculiarities were used or copied into \"Providencias.docx\". He concluded that it would not have been possible \"for someone to open the Selva Viva Database reference \u2026 and then reference them while drafting Providencias because Excel is the program that you would use to open the Selva Viva Database and it was not used.\"90\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,956ff (Lynch).\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,959-960 (Lynch).\n\n6.70.\n\nAlso at the Track II Hearing, Mr Racich testified as to the Selva Viva Database under cross-examination.91 From a forensic perspective, the Tribunal did not understand Mr Racich to be disputing Mr Lynch's expert evidence, as summarised immediately above. In particular, Mr Racich accepted that, whoever drafted the Lago Agrio Judgment, that person must have had access to an electronic copy of the Selva Viva Database or calculations derived from its statistical percentages.92\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1204-1206 (Racich).\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1205 (Racich).\n\n6.71.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in his evidence at the RICO trial, Judge Zambrano testified that he was not familiar with Excel: see Part IV above. It is not known whether his temporary student secretary, Ms \"C\", was familiar with Excel. Even assuming that she was, Excel data does not lend itself to oral dictation or mental calculation; and any dictation (if possible at all) could not have been completed within the times found by Mr Lynch regarding the use of Excel on the Zambrano Computers. Thus, the Tribunal discounts, on the forensic evidence, any use by Judge Zambrano of the Selva Viva Database in paper form. Further, the Selva Viva Database did not exist in the Lago Agrio Court's record as an electronic file (which the Respondent does not dispute); and yet the author of the Lago Agrio Judgment must have made use of the Selva Viva Database in electronic form, as an Excel file, to draft the Lago Agrio Judgment (as both Mr Lynch and Mr Racich testified). It is therefore impossible for the Tribunal to understand how Judge Zambrano could have drafted the Lago Agrio Judgment from the Selva Viva Database, for want of sufficient computer skills and the non-use of Excel on his Computers.\n\n6.72.\n\nMs Owen recorded that it appeared to be common ground between the two experts that:\n\n(a) There were no documents found on Judge Zambrano Computers that contained text from allegedly unfiled materials, including the Selva Viva Database;93 and\n\n(b) The data recorded in the Microsoft OSession log files represented the minimum amount of usage of Microsoft Office applications; and that the data had been accurately presented in evidence.94\n\nOwen, Revised Report, para 40.\n\nOwen, Revised Report, para 42.\n\n6.73.\n\nAs to the difference between the two experts' approach to the presence of the \"Plagiarised Documents\" on Judge Zambrano's Computers, Ms Owen suggested that this was a difference in factual assumptions: Mr Lynch considered that the absence of the documents was of significance when considering how the Lago Agrio Judgment came into being, whereas Mr Racich considered that this merely showed that Judge Zambrano had no electronic copies of the documents.95\n\nOwen, Revised Report, para 65.\n\n6.74.\n\nIn relation to the analysis of the use of Microsoft Excel by reference to the OSession Logs, Ms Owen similarly suggested that the difference of opinion arose out of the two experts' perceptions of technical facts. Mr Lynch was of the opinion that the author of the Lago Agrio Judgment must have used Microsoft Excel to calculate statistics from the Selva Viva Database, thereby adding weight to his view that the Judgment could not have been drafted on Judge Zambrano's Computers in the manner suggested by Dr Zambrano. Conversely, Mr Racich concluded that the available forensic evidence could not answer the source of the statistics and that there were other explanations for the presence of these statistics in the Lago Agrio Judgment.96\n\nOwen, Revised Report, para 67.\n\n***F: Internet Usage***\n-----------------------\n\n6.75.\n\nMr Lynch's second report recorded that he had performed an analysis to recover deleted records and to aggregate all the available Internet History on the Old and New Computers (with Stroz Friedberg). He identified, on both Computers, usage of Facebook and other sites related to Ms \"C\" (Judge Zambrano's temporary secretary). However, he did not identify any usage of translation or legal research services in the Internet History from either computer.97\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 23.\n\n6.76.\n\nMr Racich, in his second report, disputed Mr Lynch's implication, namely that because one can recover Internet History and since Mr Lynch found no Internet History to indicate that legal research or translation websites had been used, then such websites had not been used in the relevant period.98\n\nRacich ER 2, para 42.\n\n6.77.\n\nMr Racich explained that, through normal computer use, Internet History is deleted over time and the space where that History was stored becomes occupied by new data. If this happens, the previous Internet History will no longer be recoverable.99 Mr Racich also suggested, based on his analysis of the \"cookies\" which remained on Judge Zambrano's Computers, that there was more Internet History for the relevant time period that had been lost due to normal computer use.100\n\nRacich ER 2, para 44.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 47.\n\n6.78.\n\nMr Racich found evidence that the website \"fielweb.com\" had been used between October 2010 and March 2011; and that this was a website which enabled legal research.101 Mr Racich also found that, as early as June 2009, a user of the Old Computer had visited the translation website \"traducegratis.com\". He explained that the Internet History from this period included only seven entries for this website. However, these seven entries indicated that the site had been visited at least 69 times by September 2009. Mr Racich testified that these numbers illustrated his broader point that much of the Internet History is no longer available.102 Mr Racich also found evidence that on 4 January 2011 a user of the New Computer accessed \"windowslivetranslator.com\".103 He further noted that there was evidence that Ms \"C\" had accessed the Internet many times from both Computers during the relevant period, albeit that he only found evidence that she accessed Facebook.104\n\nRacich ER 2, para 48.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 50.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 50.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 51.\n\n6.79.\n\nMr Racich also analysed the average number of objects downloaded on particular days and identified an apparent gap in the recovered Internet History on the Old Computer between 14 July 2010 and 14 December 2010. He suggested that this could reflect a lack of Internet usage during this period or it could be (which was more likely in his opinion) because the Internet History was subsequently deleted and overwritten through normal computer use.105\n\nRacich ER 2, para 52.\n\n6.80.\n\nMr Lynch responded to these opinions in his third report, stating that: \"Mr Racich's analysis [of internet usage] does not offer any evidence that is consistent with Mr Zambrano's testimony, and his conclusion is unsupported by the evidence.\"106\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 13.\n\n6.81.\n\nIn particular, Mr Lynch pointed out that:\n\n(a) Mr Racich identified a single legal research website, \"fielweb.com\", that had been accessed via the Zambrano Computers, but the only recoverable Internet History between October 2010 and March 2011 showed that this website was only accessed on the Old Computer on two dates: 2 December 2010 and 3 January 2011. Mr Lynch further noted that Professor Riofr\u00edo's expert report indicated that \"fielweb.com\" does not contain any information about the case law from the USA which is cited in the Lago Agrio Judgment;107\n\n(b) Mr Racich found forensic evidence that a translation website, \"windowslivetranslator.com\", was accessed from the New Computer. However, Mr Lynch's further analysis indicated that this website was visited only once on 4 January 2011. Mr Lynch questioned how a user of the Old Computer could find international case law on the Old Computer using \"fielweb.com\" if the New Computer was used to access the translation service;108\n\n(c) Mr Lynch acknowledged that Mr Racich had identified \"cookies\" which suggested that other legal research and translation websites had been accessed from the Zambrano Computers, but emphasised that Mr Racich did not provide any evidence that these websites had been accessed during the relevant period. Mr Lynch disagreed with Mr Racich's suggestion that the evidence in this regard may have been incomplete because these cookies may have overwritten a previous cookie or been new cookies. Mr Lynch pointed to Mr Racich's own evidence that \"when as part of its normal operations the web browser deletes old Internet History, it often does not delete old cookies even while it deletes entries related to accessing the website's files.\" Mr Lynch highlighted that the cookies which Mr Racich discussed are not from the relevant time period, but are from periods before October 2010 or after March 2011;109 and\n\n(d) Whilst Mr Lynch agreed with Mr Racich that recoverable Internet History can be limited, he emphasised that a considerable volume of Internet History \u2013 approximately 50,000 records \u2013 was recovered from the Zambrano Computers for the relevant period. Fewer than 10 of these records relate to \"fielweb.com\" or \"windowslivetranslator.com\".110\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 13; see Riofr\u00edo ER, paras 9 & 25.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 13.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 14.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 15.\n\n6.82.\n\nIn his third report, Mr Racich dismissed Mr Lynch's comments on Internet History as irrelevant. In particular, he testified that: \"The fact that there is not more evidence of particular sites in the recoverable history is likely a consequence of the inherent limitation of the limited history available years after the fact. And the fact that a particular number of history records (Mr Lynch says 50,000) between October 2010 and March 2011 were recovered does not tell us what percentage of the \u2026 total that number represents.\"111 Mr Racich explained that his conclusion that the recovered history is necessarily limited is based on, in particular, gaps in the recorded \"hit counts\" of particular websites.112\n\nRacich ER 3, para 17.\n\nRacich ER 3, para 18.\n\n6.83.\n\nIn his direct examination at the Track II Hearing, Mr Lynch gave a general explanation of how Internet History can be recovered. Both experts agree that Internet History degrades over time, but that cookies are often not deleted even when Internet History records are deleted. On this basis, Mr Lynch stated that, \"\u2026 in order for there to be no evidence of any other legal research Website on Mr Zambrano's computer, all of the Internet History records would have had to have degraded, disappeared and been overwritten such that they're no longer recoverable and the cookie would have had to have been deleted and overwritten.\"113\n\nTrack II Hearing D5,955 (Lynch).\n\n6.84.\n\nIn cross-examination, Mr Lynch reiterated that the cookies which Mr Racich had identified for websites such as LexisWeb and LexisNexis all post-dated the relevant period. He rejected the suggestion that Judge Zambrano might have used these websites previously and that the website might have created a new cookie which replaced the record of the earlier visits. Mr Lynch explained that, when a website created a new cookie, generally \"the creation date for that cookie would stay from [the first date the website was accessed] because of a property known as file tunnelling, where if you create a file in the same location with the same name where a file was recently deleted, it will adopt the creation date of the file that previously existed.\"114\n\nTrack II Hearing D5.1090-1091 (Lynch).\n\n6.85.\n\nMr Racich, in his cross-examination, confirmed that the only evidence of a visit to a legal research site which had a date and time stamp within the relevant period was the \"fielweb.com\" site.115 He stated that he did not know whether \"fielweb.com\" could be used to locate the English language cases which were in the 21 December version of \"Providencias.docx\" as he had not done any analysis of what documents were available on that website.116 In relation to translation websites, Mr Racich confirmed that the only evidence of visits to \"traducegratis.com\" was from 2009 and that the visit to \"windowslivetranslator.com\" occurred on 4 January 2011, which was after English language legal authorities had appeared in the December 21 version of Providencias.117\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1231 (Racich).\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1231 (Racich).\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1232-1233 (Racich).\n\n6.86.\n\nMr Racich was also questioned about visits to a website \u2013 \"live.com\". He agreed that this log-in page could be used to access Hotmail. He also confirmed that the hit count for this website was 14 on 7 January 2011 and had increased to 29 on 13 January 2011. He agreed that during this period in early January 2011 someone on Judge Zambrano's Computers was logging into Hotmail. Mr Racich confirmed that he had not recovered the contents of any emails that were opened from Hotmail on Judge Zambrano's Computers.118\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1239 (Racich).\n\n6.87.\n\nMr Racich agreed that the Internet History recovered from Judge Zambrano's Old Computer (as set out in Exhibit 21 of Mr Lynch's second report) indicated that someone on that Computer had opened Hotmail at 17.33 on 12 January 2011 and two minutes later the \"Caso Texaco.doc\" document was opened on the Old Computer. It was noted that 19 January 2011 was the date of a recovered version of \"Caso Texaco.doc\" containing Judgment text.119\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1247 (Racich).\n\n6.88.\n\nMs Owen highlighted the differences in the conclusions reached by Mr Lynch and Mr Racich in relation to the recoverable Internet History. Mr Lynch reported that no evidence of visits to legal research or translation websites was found and concluded that this demonstrated an inconsistency in Dr Zambrano's testimony at the RICO trial. Mr Racich, however, concluded that websites which could have been used for legal research and language translation were accessed between October 2010 and February 2011. He also concluded that the Internet History was incomplete, probably due to subsequent usage of the Computers. Ms Owen explained that, during the meeting with the two experts at The Hague on 12 January 2016, the two experts had suggested that these differences in opinion arose out of instructions to them from their respective appointing Parties.\n\n6.89.\n\nIt was noted that:\n\n(a) Mr Lynch had been instructed to research the Internet History for evidence of visits to legal research and translation websites consistent with Dr Zambrano's testimony and the content of the \"Providencias.docx\" document; whereas\n\n(b) Mr Racich had been instructed to search for evidence of visits to legal research and translation websites within the time-frame of October 2010 to February 2011 and to provide a general account of Internet History and an explanation of why there might be no evidence.\n\nMs Owen expressed the view that the difference in these opinions arises out of different expectations of how much evidence of Internet activity might be recovered in a given set of circumstances.\n\n***G: USB Analysis***\n---------------------\n\n6.90.\n\nMr Lynch, in his second report, identified 18 USB devices that were known to have been used on the Old or New Computers between October 2010 and March 2011.120 He then reviewed the records of files accessed on both Computers to determine what files might have existed on the USB devices. He identified 41 files accessed from USB devices, but noted that the computer records reviewed by him (with Stroz Friedberg) were not designed to record every single file that was accessed or existed on USB devices; and that, therefore, many more files could have existed and/or been accessed.121 Further, Mr Lynch did not have access to the USB devices themselves (nor did Mr Racich); and therefore he could not know the content of the files or whether any of them related to the Lago Agrio Judgment.122 Nonetheless, so Mr Lynch suggested, the formatting differences in \"Providencias.docx\" are consistent with having been copied and pasted from another document, including documents accessed from USB devices.123\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 36.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 36.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 37.\n\nLynch ER 2, pp. 37-38.\n\n6.91.\n\nMr Racich, in his second report, concluded that neither Mr Lynch's nor his own analysis revealed any evidence that any Lago Agrio related document was transferred to Judge Zambrano's Computers whilst he was drafting the Lago Agrio Judgment.124 Mr Racich emphasised that no forensic evidence showed that USB devices were inserted into either of Judge Zambrano's computers between 1 February 2011 and 20 February 2011.125\n\nRacich ER 2, paras 53-64.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 56.\n\n6.92.\n\nMr Racich explained that he had performed (with Vestigant) an independent analysis of all evidence of files opened from USB devices on either the Old or New Computers between October 2010 and March 2011. This analysis indicated that up to 56 documents were opened from USB devices in this time period. Mr Racich suggested that a review of file names and types indicated that the files so opened were predominantly picture and PowerPoint files, with only a small number of Word files.126 Mr Racich identified two copies of the same document, which appeared to be connected to the Lago Agrio Litigation. Both files had the same name (\"PROVIDENCIA CHEVRON TEXACO DE FECHA 15 DE JUNIO DEL 2010.docx\") and almost identical metadata. However, Mr Racich noted that this document appeared to be a Word version of an order issued in June 2010 when Judge Zambrano was not the presiding judge in the Lago Agrio Litigation. This document appeared to have been copied to the New Computer on 7 December 2010 via a thumb drive with the volume name \"MARIELA\".127\n\nRacich ER 2, para 59.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 60.\n\n6.93.\n\nIn Mr Racich's opinion, the vast majority (30 out of 43) of the documents and folders opened from USB devices, as identified by Mr Lynch, appeared to have been opened from a USB device named \"EVELYN\" and appeared to be Ms \"C\"'s personal documentation. A further four documents were opened from a USB device named \"MARIELA\" which indicated that they were from Mariela Salazar, the court secretary. Three of the 43 documents were from a USB named \"My Disc\" and appeared to be related to the IT Department's set up of Microsoft Office on the New Computer.128\n\nRacich ER 2, para 61.\n\n6.94.\n\nMr Racich noted that the only other instances of documents being opened between November 2010 and February 2011 from other USB devices related to four documents and one folder (which were exhibited to Mr Lynch's second report as Exhibit 7). Mr Racich pointed out that Mr Lynch had provided no evidence that these documents had any bearing on the Lago Agrio Litigation.129\n\nRacich ER 2, para 62.\n\n6.95.\n\nThe analysis of the USB drives was not taken much further by the two experts in their third written reports. Mr Lynch criticised Mr Racich for speculating about the contents of the files on the USB devices, emphasising that, although Mr Racich claimed to have performed a thorough analysis of all the files on all the USB devices connected to the Zambrano Computers in the relevant time frame, he had not offered any evidence of that review; nor claimed that he had had access to any of the USB devices. Mr Lynch noted that, without examining the actual USB devices, the only evidence Mr Racich had reviewed was the names of the files and the metadata highlighted in Mr Lynch's second report. Mr Lynch stated that Mr Racich's conclusions as to the content of the files were therefore mere speculation.130 Mr Racich did not respond to this criticism in his third report.\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 24.\n\n6.96.\n\nIn cross-examination, Mr Racich was pressed on the dates on which USB devices were connected to Judge Zambrano's Computers, as set out in Table 23 in Mr Lynch's second report. This cross-examination showed that:\n\n(a) The \"Providencias.docx\" document was created on 11 October 2010 and on the following day a USB device was connected;131\n\n(b) Between 12 October 2010 and 21 December 2010, at least seven USB devices were connected;132\n\n(c) In the period between 21 December and 28 December 2010, two more USB devices were connected;133\n\n(d) In the period after 28 December 2010 and 19 January 2011 (when Judgment text was recovered from the \"Caso Texaco.doc\" document) a further three USB connections were made to the Zambrano Computers;134 and\n\n(e) Table 23 of Mr Lynch's third report indicates that a further five connections were made (three from the same device) between 20 January 2011 and 21 February 2011.\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 36, Table 23 indicates that this USB device was connected to the Old Computer.\n\nThis USB was connected to the New Computer.\n\nAgain, this device was connected to the New Computer.\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1225 (Racich).\n\n6.97.\n\nMr Racich confirmed that a person at one of the Zambrano Computers could have opened a document from one of the USB devices, copied text out of that document and pasted it into a document which was already on the Computer, closed the document on the USB device and unplugged the USB device; and that it would then not be possible to know what text had been transferred.135\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1228 (Racich).\n\n6.98.\n\nMr Racich also accepted that, during the period from October 2010 to February 2011, 13 USB devices were attached to the Zambrano Computers, as Mr Lynch had testified earlier.136 Neither Mr Lynch nor Mr Racich had any access to these 13 USB devices.\n\nTrack II Hearing D6.1223 (Racich); D5,962 (Lynch).\n\n***H: Bulk Copying***\n---------------------\n\n6.99.\n\nAs described above, Mr Lynch's analysis (with Stroz Friedberg) of the Old Computer found that Windows XP was installed on 14 July 2010. On the same day, a significant amount of data was copied to the Old Computer, including 2,428 Microsoft Word documents. This data included files relating to the Lago Agrio Litigation. Mr Lynch's view was that this bulk copying, combined with the evidence he had found of files and folders from a previous installation of Windows, was consistent with the reinstallation of the operating system, possibly as part of trouble-shooting or maintenance.137\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 11.\n\n6.100.\n\nMr Lynch also found evidence of subsequent bulk copying of data onto the Old Computer, in particular in September 2012. This was some five months after Judge Zambrano had relinquished the Old Computer; and long after he had completed his assignment to the Lago Agrio Litigation (4 March 2011). On 26 September 2012, 2,202 files were created in a four minute interval and subsequently deleted. Mr Lynch stated that the bulk copying of files on the Old Computer would have overwritten or destroyed data on the Old Computer; and that this was consistent with an attempt to overwrite previously deleted data.138\n\nLynch ER 2, p. 11.\n\n6.101.\n\nMr Racich, in his second report, somewhat overstated Mr Lynch's conclusion, suggesting that Mr Lynch had concluded that \"evidence of data copied in bulk to both the Old Computer and New Computer reveals some deliberate attempt to overwrite deleted data on these computers.\"139 In Mr Racich's expert opinion, the forensic evidence did not point to data destruction as the likely motive. He explained that, because it is not possible to know where previously deleted files were stored or to determine which parts of unallocated space will be overwritten by new data, a person who is trying to destroy data will typically try to fill up as much unallocated space as possible; e.g. by copying large files such as movies.140 By contrast, the bulk copying on 26 September 2012 involved files that consisted mainly of Microsoft Office documents These files took up less than 1% of the total space on the drive and less than 4% of the unallocated space.141\n\nRacich ER 2, para 65.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 67.\n\nRacich ER 2, para 68.\n\n6.102.\n\nIn his third report, Mr Lynch pointed out that Mr Racich had omitted to mention that the final action, in relation to the bulk copying carried out on 26 September 2012, was the deletion of the copied files. Mr Lynch concluded that this forensic evidence was inconsistent with Mr Racich's conclusion this activity was a normal backup.142\n\nLynch ER 3, p. 34.\n\n6.103.\n\nMr Racich responded that, while Mr Lynch had discounted the fact that only 734 MB of data was copied, this was a key point in determining whether the copying and deletion was a deliberate attempt to overwrite data. He reiterated that this data comprised only 4% of the free space on the Computer. This action was therefore unlikely to overwrite any particular data and would not guarantee that any particular data was overwritten.143 In response to Mr Lynch's view that the subsequent deletion of the copied files was a strong indicator that the user was attempting to overwrite data, Mr Racich noted that it was not the deletion of the data that overwrote the small amount of unallocated space, but the prior copying. He noted that there are many possible motivations for a person to create, fill and then delete a folder; e.g. this may have been a temporary backup; and the motivation could not be ascertained through forensic investigations.144\n\nRacich ER 3, para 51.\n\nRacich ER 3, para 52.\n\n6.104.\n\nMs Owen records that it was common ground between the two experts that, while bulk copying of data to the Zambrano Computers had the potential to overwrite previously deleted files, there was no technical evidence which would enable them to determine the actual motive for the bulk copying in this instance.145\n\nOwen, Revised Report, para 29.\n\n***I: The Tribunal's Conclusions***\n-----------------------------------\n\n6.105.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that both Mr Lynch and Mr Racich were honest witnesses, seeking to assist the Tribunal in good faith consistent with their obligations as expert witnesses. The Tribunal also acknowledges that both expert witnesses are experienced and knowledgeable specialists in a specialist and complex field. The Tribunal also owes a special debt to Ms Owen, a much respected and senior specialist in this field.\n\n6.106.\n\nFor a long time during this Track II phase of the arbitration, it seemed that the forensic evidence available from Judge Zambrano's two Computers could provide a definitive answer to the 'ghostwriting' issues, one way or the other. It remains tantalisingly close; but, to the Tribunal's regret, there is no such reliable answer from the forensic evidence. There is no 'smoking gun', but rather a mass of complex questions that cannot be answered on the limited forensic materials made available at the time to Mr Lynch, Mr Racich and Ms Owen, without much more evidence from other electronic devices available to Judge Zambrano, Mr Fajardo and others in Ecuador.\n\n6.107.\n\nGiven that the Claimants bear the legal burden of proof on these forensic issues (as with its other allegations) under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the absence of such a definitive answer means that the Claimants' case does not prevail on the forensic issues by themselves, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n6.108.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal considers that much useful work was done by the Parties' two experts and Ms Owen. The eventual differences between the two experts are more differences of perspective, also influenced by non-technical factors lying outside their expert functions in this arbitration and influenced their respective terms of reference from the Parties. What this this Tribunal can safely derive for this Award from all the forensic evidence and the forensic expert evidence is therefore less than complete. However, in the aggregate, it justifies two conclusions by the Tribunal.\n\n6.109.\n\nFirst, the account given at the RICO trial by Dr Zambrano as to how he wrote personally the full Lago Agrio Judgment on his New Computer (with his student secretary) is inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable.\n\n6.110.\n\nSecond, whilst the forensic evidence alone does not prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the Lago Agrio Judgment was corruptly 'ghostwritten' by one or more the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, it is more likely than not that the Judgment was drafted in material part on a computer or device other than the Zambrano Computers. By itself, in the Tribunal's view, the likely use of another computer or device is not proof of 'ghostwriting'; but, equally, it is not proof that there was no 'ghostwriting'.\n\n6.111.\n\nThese conclusions as to the forensic evidence are consistent with the earlier conclusions reached by the Tribunal in Parts IV and V above that, based on all the evidence available to the Tribunal in this arbitration (other than the forensic evidence), the Lago Agrio Judgment was at least in material part 'ghostwritten' by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, in corrupt collusion with Judge Zambrano.\n\n***PART VII*** - ***JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n7.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the issues arising from the Tribunal's disputed jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims and the admissibility of such claims under Articles VI(1)(a), VI(1)(c), II(3)(a), II(3)(c) and II(7) of the Treaty, as asserted by the Claimants and disputed by the Respondent. For ease of reference, where appropriate, these issues are collectively described as \"jurisdictional\" issues.\n\n7.2.\n\nIn its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 27 February 2012, the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over TexPet's pleaded claims under both Articles VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, thereby rejecting all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction over TexPet's claims: see Paragraph 5.3 of the Third Interim Award (set out in Annex 1(H) to Part I above), with Paragraphs 4.14ff and 4.31ff. Accordingly, in this Award as explained further below, the Tribunal addresses the merits of TexPet's pleaded claims under Articles II(3)(a), II(3)(c) and II(7) of the Treaty.\n\n7.3.\n\nIn its Third Interim Award, the Tribunal also decided that it had jurisdiction over Chevron's pleaded claims under Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, with respect to its 'indirect' investment in TexPet. The Tribunal there left expressly undecided whether the Tribunal had any jurisdiction over Chevron's pleaded claims under Article VI(1)(a) and also, with respect to any 'direct' investment, under Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, thereby joining these issues to the merits. The Tribunal otherwise rejected all jurisdictional objections made by the Respondent to Chevron's pleaded claims: see Paragraph 5.4 of the Third Interim Award (set out in Annex 1(H) to Part I above), with Paragraphs 4.22ff and 4.38ff.\n\n7.4.\n\nAs regards the Respondent's extant jurisdictional objections under Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal again exercises its powers of 'Kompetenz-Kompetenz' under Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, forming part of the Parties' Arbitration Agreement.1\n\nThe term \"Arbitration Agreement\" is explained above, in Part I of this Award.\n\n7.5.\n\nIt is necessary first, however, to refer to the material texts of the Treaty and subsequently to several special features of this case. Whilst the latter are not exclusively relevant to issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, it is nonetheless convenient to address them in this Part of the Award.\n\n***B: The Treaty***\n-------------------\n\n7.6.\n\n*(1) The Treaty* : The Tribunal notes that Articles II(3)(a), II(3)(c) and II(7) of the Treaty, as regards the FET standard, the FPS standard, customary international law and \"effective means\", provide four possible bases for the Claimants' claims, read with Articles VI(1)(a) and (c) of the Treaty. The Tribunal addresses each of these below.\n\n7.7.\n\n*\"Investment\":* Article I(1) of the Treaty of the Treaty provides (in material part):2\n\n*\"For the purposes of this Treaty,*\n\n*(a) 'investment' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:*\n\n*(i) \u2026;*\n\n*(ii) \u2026;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) \u2026 and*\n\n*(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licences and permits pursuant to law; \u2026\"*\n\nC-279. The relevant provisions of the Treaty are more fully set out, for ease of reference, in Part III(B) above. The full text of the Treaty (in English and Spanish) is reproduced in Annex 5 to Part I above.\n\n7.8.\n\n\"*Investment Dispute*\": Article VI(1) of the Treaty provides:3\n\n*\"For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; \u2026 ; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\"*\n\nC-279.\n\n7.9.\n\n*Investment Protection:* Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty provides:4\n\n\"*Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\"*\n\nC-279.\n\n7.10.\n\n*\"Umbrella Clause\":* Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty provides:5\n\n*\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regards to investments.\"*\n\nC-279.\n\n7.11.\n\n*Effective Means*\": Article II(7) of the Treaty provides, in material part:6\n\n*\"Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investments \u2026\"*\n\nC-279.\n\n7.12.\n\n*(2) The FET Standard and Customary International Law:* As regards the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that these two bases, whether together or separately, provide similar protections against denial of justice. It was decided in *Azinian v Mexico*, as also in *Mondev v USA*,7 that the FET standard in NAFTA Article 1105 included protection against a denial of justice. However, the FET standard, not being limited to a protection against a denial of justice, provides a broader protection than denial of justice under customary international law, both in scope and as to the time when a choate claim accrues other than for denial of justice (by reason of the principle of judicial finality applicable to a claim for denial of justice, as considered separately below).8\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen Baca v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, paras 91 & 102-103, CLA-299; *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para 127, CLA-7. See also the cases cited in Part VIII below, at para 8.24.\n\nAs to \"scope\", the Tribunal refers to *Merrill and Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, 31 March 2010, paras 182-218, CLA-606. As to \"accrual\", see paras 7,116ff below.\n\n7.13.\n\nHence, the Tribunal does not need to treat the protection against denial of justice under customary international law as a separate standard of protection from denial of justice under the FET standard. It is also unnecessary to do so on the facts of the present case as found in this Award: a denial of justice under customary international law necessarily will entail a breach of the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty. Accordingly, references below to denial of justice under the FET standard should be understood, where appropriate, as referring also to denial of justice under customary international law.\n\n7.14.\n\n*(3) The FPS Standard:* As to the third basis for the Claimants' claims for denial of justice, the Tribunal considers that the FPS standard, as provided in the same Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, adds nothing material in the present case to the protection afforded by the FET standard and customary international law. Hence, the Tribunal does not address further the meaning or effect of this FPS standard.\n\n7.15.\n\n*(4) Effective Means:* As to the fourth basis for the Claimants' claims, the Tribunal notes that this provision in Article II(7) of the Treaty, as regards \"effective means\", has been invoked by the Claimants and disputed by the Respondent in other arbitrations under the Treaty, as also in this arbitration.\n\n7.16.\n\nIt was the subject of the UNCITRAL tribunal's award dated 30 March 2010 between Chevron and TexPet (as claimants) and the Respondent (as respondent) in the *Commercial Cases Arbitration*.9 It was also the subject of the Respondent's claim (as claimant) against the USA (as respondent) in the *Ecuador-USA Treaty Arbitration*.10 That State-State arbitration did not proceed beyond the issue of jurisdiction; and it did not therefore decide the parties' disputed interpretation of \"effective means\" in the Treaty (by reason of that tribunal's award dated 29 September 2012).11\n\n*Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on the Merits, 30 March 2010, paras 242ff, CLA-47; see Part IV(G)(3) above.\n\nSee Part IV(G)(4) above.\n\nThis award on jurisdiction lies in the public domain. Ecuador's claim (as to the merits) can be gleaned from Professor Reisman's expert opinion of 24 April 2012 (for the USA), which is also publicly available.\n\n7.17.\n\nThe award in the *Commercial Cases Arbitration,* applying \"effective means\" as a protection for Chevron and TexPet under the Treaty, had followed the earlier approach taken by the tribunal in *Duke Energy v Ecuador* by its award of 18 August 2008.12 The award in *Commercial Cases* was in turn followed, as to \"effective means\", by the tribunal in *White Industries v India* in its award of 30 November 2011.13\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, para 391, RLA-40, cited in *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on the Merits, 30 March 2010, para 242, CLA-47. The latter also cited *Petrobart Limited v. Kyrgyz Republic*, SCC Arb. No. 126/2003, Award, 29 March 2005, CLA-219 (see p. 28ss) and *Limited Liability Company AMTO v. Ukraine*, SCC Arb. No. 080/2005, Final Award, 26 March 2008, RLA-343 (see para 88).\n\n*White Industries Australia Limited v. India*, UNCITRAL (Ad hoc), Award, 30 November 2011, paras 10.4 & 11.3ff, RLA-347.\n\n7.18.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants contend that the Treaty's provision as to \"effective means\" in Article II(7) operates as a ' *lex specialis* ', distinct from protection against denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, albeit also partly overlapping with such protections. The Claimants contend that a host State may breach the Treaty's provision as to \"effective means\" (being a less demanding test), even when the State's conduct does not amount to a wrongful denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.14\n\nSee Caron ER 1, particularly his conclusions (para 170); Caron ER 2, particularly his further conclusions (paras 22 to 24); see also Paulsson ER 1, paras 23-28. See generally J. Gaffney & J. Loftis, \"The 'Effective Means Meaning' of BITs and the Jurisdiction of Treaty-based Tribunals to hear Contract Claims\" (2007) 8(1) Journal of World Investment & Trade 5, CLA-213.\n\n7.19.\n\nThe Respondent disputes these submissions. It contends that, by \"effective means\" under Article II(7), the two States incorporated into the Treaty pre-existing obligations under customary international law, requiring each State to provide an effective framework or system under which claims may be asserted and rights enforced. However, according to the Respondent, the two States did not thereby undertake an obligation to assure that such framework or system was to be effective in particular cases, beyond the protection against denial of justice.15 Thus, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot here invoke such an obligation (with its lesser demanding test), separately from protection against denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.16\n\nSee R-TII Mar. 2015, para 375.\n\nSee R-TII Mar. 2015, paras 375ff.\n\n7.20.\n\nFor the purposes of this Award, the Tribunal does not address further the meaning or effect of \"effective means\" in Article II(7) of the Treaty. It is unnecessary to do so on the facts of the present case, as found in this Award applying the FET standard under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including protection against denial of justice).\n\n7.21.\n\nLest it be misunderstood, the Tribunal's reticence as regards the Parties' disputed interpretation of Article II(7) of the Treaty should not be taken as implicitly accepting or rejecting one or other of the Parties' interpretations.\n\n7.22.\n\n*(5) The Umbrella Clause* : The Claimants claim (denied by the Respondent) that the Respondent did not observe its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement to release Chevron and TexPet from diffuse liabilities, thereby committing a breach of Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. These claims are distinct from the Claimants' claims for denial of justice, albeit also occasioned by the Lago Agrio Judgment with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts.\n\n***C: Special Features***\n-------------------------\n\n7.23.\n\nThere are several special features to the Claimants' claims against the Respondent for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n7.24.\n\n*(1) Transnational Enforcement:* Chevron had no significant realisable assets in Ecuador, whether owned directly or indirectly, before and after the \"merger\" with Texaco in 2001. Before the \"merger\", Chevron was a stranger to Texaco and TexPet. Texaco and TexPet had left Ecuador by 1992. Neither Texaco nor TexPet left behind any significant realisable assets in Ecuador. Following the \"merger\", therefore, Chevron's indirect ownership of Texaco and TexPet did not endow Chevron with any significant realisable assets in Ecuador.\n\n7.25.\n\nOutside Ecuador, however, Chevron, with its large group of associated companies, indirectly owned (and still owns) substantial assets, including ocean-going vessels, bank deposits around the world, and other properties. By their nature, vessels and bank deposits were and remain vulnerable to arrest, attachment or seizure by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs upon the Lago Agrio Judgment's enforcement in multiple jurisdictions, especially *ex parte* without prior notice. Even if Chevron were in a position to discharge promptly such an order freezing a bank deposit or arresting a vessel, the damage to Chevron and its associated companies from such repeated actions could have been very significant (as it may still be).\n\n7.26.\n\nHence, as confirmed by the \"Invictus Memorandum\" (see Part IV above), the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives always intended that the Lago Agrio Judgment should be enforced in multiple jurisdictions outside Ecuador, not limited to the USA. This Memorandum listed such other foreign jurisdictions expressly, including the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Canada, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Belgium, Indonesia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and Russia. It would be possible to add many more jurisdictions to this list.\n\n7.27.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Litigation was therefore likely to involve, from its outset, numerous national jurisdictions other than Ecuador. This feature makes the present case unusual. Earlier cases on denial of justice have concerned an alleged wrong and an alleged injury taking place within the same State. Here, the injury to Chevron was always intended to take place, at least in part, in one or more foreign jurisdictions elsewhere than Ecuador, whether by the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment or by an enforced \"amicable\" settlement. Thus, the Lago Agrio Litigation was transnational in the broadest sense, as confirmed by the multiplicity of foreign lawsuits and arbitrations in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands and elsewhere following the issuance of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n7.28.\n\n*(2) The Individual Plaintiffs:* The parties to the Lago Agrio Litigation are not the same as the parties to this arbitration under the Treaty. TexPet, the Second Claimant in this arbitration, was not a named party to the Lago Agrio Litigation (or the Aguinda Litigation). The Respondent was not a party to the Lago Agrio Litigation (or the Aguinda Litigation). Chevron, the First Claimant in this arbitration, was the sole defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n7.29.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Judgment was made in favour of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation. These Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had been plaintiffs in the Aguinda Litigation. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are not parties to this arbitration. Moreover, they have not participated, nor could they participate, as parties to this arbitration between the Claimants and the Respondent under the terms of the Parties' Arbitration Agreement derived from the Treaty.\n\n7.30.\n\nThus, so the Respondent contends, Chevron's claims against the Respondent impugning the Lago Agrio Judgment under the Treaty could, if successful in this arbitration, gravely prejudice these Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. It could even require the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to begin new legal proceedings in Ecuador, or elsewhere. The Respondent, therefore, advances in this arbitration a 'cross-claim' for environmental damage against Chevron, by way of an \"offset\" (or set-off), unjust enrichment, causation and contributory fault under Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.17 (For ease of reference, although these grounds differ juridically, the Tribunal here refers to them collectively as a 'cross-claim').\n\nR-TII Mar. 2015, paras 439ff.\n\n7.31.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent submits that any decision by this Tribunal that the Lago Agrio Judgment was a nullity (or any other like relief) would effectively immunise Chevron from justifiable liability to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs because new legal proceedings by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs would be time-barred under Ecuadorian law. As pleaded in its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent contends that: \"\u2026 granting Claimants' proposed relief would have the same effect as granting them special immunity from liability for the environmental harm that [the Lago Agrio] Plaintiffs were found to have suffered from Claimants' misconduct.\"18\n\nR-TII Feb. 2013, paras 464ff and 502.\n\n7.32.\n\nAs a matter of international law, the Respondent again invokes the judgment of the International Court of Justice in *Monetary Gold* (1954), as it did at the November Hearing leading to the Tribunal's Third Interim Award.19 In brief, the International Court of Justice decided in *Monetary Gold* that an international tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over a dispute between two States when the rights of a third State, not being a party to the legal proceedings, form the subject-matter of the dispute.\n\n*Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America)*, ICJ, Judgment (Preliminary Question), 15 June 1954, 1954 ICJ Reports 19, RLA-19. For the Respondent's earlier submissions, see the Tribunal's Third Interim Award, paras 3.59ff, 3.83ff & 4.59ff.\n\n7.33.\n\nIt is clear to this Tribunal that parts of the declaratory relief requested by the Claimants in this arbitration (if granted) could be used by Chevron, at least forensically, to defend the enforcement proceedings of the Lago Agrio Judgment by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in, for example, Canada.20 Indeed, the Claimants recognise that the nullity of the Lago Agrio Judgment, if decided by the Tribunal, \"may well have an effect on the beneficiaries of that judgment as a matter of fact.\"21\n\nSee Track II Hearing D12.2708-2713.\n\nPaulsson ER 2, para 50.\n\n7.34.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge, however, that there was no procedural possibility for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to become parties to this arbitration; and \"[n]or is there any forum that could adjudicate a dispute between Chevron, Ecuador and the [Lago Agrio] plaintiffs with international law as the applicable law.\"22 The Claimants dispute, however, any prejudice to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs from any applicable time-bar, relying upon the expert testimony of Dr Coronel on Ecuadorian law.23\n\nPaulsson ER 2, para 49.\n\nCoronel ER 5, para 108; Paulsson ER 2, para 44; but see also Paulsson ER 2, para 50.\n\n7.35.\n\nIn its Third Interim Award, the Tribunal decided to reject the Respondent's jurisdictional objection based upon \"Third Party Rights\" and *Monetary Gold*. The Tribunal there assumed, for the sake of argument, that the principle in *Monetary Gold* applied to mixed (i.e. State/Non-State) arbitrations under bilateral investment treaties (such as this arbitration) and to circumstances in which a mixed tribunal adjudicating upon the liability of a State might have to consider matters that were the subject of litigation with private persons elsewhere.24 Nonetheless, the Tribunal decided that its decisions on the dispute between the Parties in this arbitration \"would not decide the question of the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as between the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and Chevron\"; that \"the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs cannot here be regarded as indispensable third parties\"; and that \"this case can properly proceed to the merits of the Claimants' claims without them.\"25\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.60.\n\nThird Interim award, para 4.67.\n\n7.36.\n\nThe Tribunal here confirms that decision, for these and other reasons set out in its Third Interim Award. It does not consider that any of its decisions made in this arbitration can be legally binding upon any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide upon the individual claims for personal harm (not being diffuse claims) of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; and it has not sought to exercise any such jurisdiction in this arbitration.\n\n7.37.\n\n*(3) Environmental Damage:* The Respondent makes a related submission, relevant to its cross-claim for environmental damage (as defined above). The Respondent contends that there is a risk of unjustly enriching Chevron in this arbitration with a \"windfall\". It submits that Chevron's burden of proving loss caused by the alleged denial of justice requires Chevron to prove that: \"\u2026 it is more likely than not that they would have prevailed on the merits in the underlying environmental litigation before a fair and impartial Ecuadorian court. Otherwise, Claimants would receive indemnification from the State [the Respondent] for damages that a fair and impartial court justifiably would have awarded the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs anyway.\"26\n\nR-TII Feb. 2013, paras 452 & 471.\n\n7.38.\n\nThe Tribunal's several awards, orders and decisions to date have left intact any environmental claims in the Lago Agrio Litigation \"made by an individual for personal harm in respect of that individual's rights separate and distinct from the Respondent\": see the First Partial Award.27 As the Tribunal also decided (by a majority) in its Decision on Track 1B, the Lago Agrio Complaint included individual claims materially similar, in substance, to the individual claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York: see Paragraph 186(3) of the Decision.28 It is also common ground between the Parties that claims made by an individual for personal harm (not being a diffuse claim), including one or more of the Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, are not precluded by the Claimants' case in this arbitration, howsoever decided by the Tribunal.\n\nFirst Partial Award, para 112(3). (See Annex 1 to Part I above).\n\nDecision on Track 1B (see Annex 1 to Part I above).\n\n7.39.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, therefore, it remains clear that individual claims for personal harm from environmental damage, made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in the Aguinda Litigation in New York or similar claims for personal harm (not being diffuse claims) made by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, are not and cannot be claims asserted by the Respondent in its own right against Chevron (or TexPet) in this arbitration.\n\n7.40.\n\nFor its cross-claim in this arbitration, therefore, the Respondent cannot assert against Chevron (or TexPet) personal rights possessed only by these Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs as individuals. Such an assertion would require an exercise lying beyond this Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Parties' Arbitration Agreement, inconsistent with the Tribunal's application of the principle in *Monetary Gold* in its Third Interim Award (see above).\n\n7.41.\n\nNor can any claims be made by the Respondent, in its own right, against Chevron (or TexPet), given the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as decided by the Tribunal in its First Partial Award.29 Under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent is precluded from asserting any diffuse claim against Chevron as a \"Releasee\" (as also TexPet and, likewise, Texaco as \"Releasees\").\n\nFirst Partial Award, para 112(3), (see Annex 1 to Part I above).\n\n7.42.\n\nThus, whatever right is here being asserted by the Respondent for its cross-claim alleging environmental damage, it is a right belonging only to these individual plaintiffs alleging personal harm. It is not a right belonging to the Respondent. If it were otherwise, the Respondent's cross-claim could only be a diffuse claim. However, the Respondent cannot assert a diffuse claim against Chevron (or TexPet) without the Respondent violating the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as decided by this Tribunal. There is therefore no safe passage for the Respondent's cross-claim between Scylla and Charybdis.\n\n7.43.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent's crossclaim impugns its jurisdiction (or, as regards admissibility, the exercise of its jurisdiction) to decide other issues between the Claimants and the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n7.44.\n\nConversely, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Respondent's cross-claim; and, in the exercise of such jurisdiction, it decides that the Respondent has no standing or right to bring such a cross-claim. Moreover, in a case (such as this) where the claimant's alleged liability to a cross-claim would result from a court judgment impugned by the claimant, the Tribunal considers that the respondent cannot rely upon that judgment to shift the legal burden of proof to the claimant; and that, in this case, the Respondent has not discharged its legal burden of proving its cross-claim.\n\n7.45.\n\nNonetheless, as the Respondent's Counsel rightly submitted at the Track II Hearing, the individual Aguinda and Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are \"real plaintiffs\" with \"real claims.\"30 For the avoidance of any doubt, the Tribunal re-confirms that it has no jurisdiction under the Treaty to decide upon the merits of these individual plaintiffs' claims for personal harm against Chevron (not being diffuse claims).\n\nTrack II Hearing D13.3033.\n\n***D: Issues as to Jurisdiction and Admissibility***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n7.46.\n\n*(1) Introduction:* As already indicated, TexPet was not a named party to the Lago Agrio Litigation. Its position is therefore different from Chevron as the sole named defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation. It is necessary to consider their respective positions separately, as partly decided in the Tribunal's Third Interim Award (see this Part VII's \"Introduction\" above).\n\n7.47.\n\nIt is also necessary to address separately: (i) the Claimants' claims for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (ii) the Claimants' claims as \"Releasees\" in the 1995 Settlement Agreement under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.48.\n\n*(2) The Third Interim Award* : As decided in the Tribunal's Third Interim Award,31 TexPet's \"investment\" qualifies as to jurisdiction, admissibility and protection under Articles I(1)(a)(iii), I(1)(a)(v), II(3)(a), II(3)(c), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.32\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Respondent's legal proceedings in the Netherlands challenging the Third Interim Award (as with other Awards) remain pending before the Hoge Raad: see the Claimants' letter dated 19 March 2018, p. 2 and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 2. In addition, the Respondent has requested the Tribunal to re-consider its Third Interim Award, a procedure to be completed in Track III of this arbitration: see R-TI Mar. 2014, paras 134-138 and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 6, fn 15. For present purposes, the Tribunal takes no account of these pending proceedings and request.\n\nThird Interim Award, paras 4.20 & 4.36.\n\n7.49.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal there decided that the 1995 Settlement Agreement (to which TexPet was a party and signatory) was not, by itself, an \"investment\" made by TexPet under the Treaty.33 Nevertheless, as regards TexPet, the Tribunal decided that the 1995 Settlement Agreement must be treated as \"a continuation\" of the earlier 1964 and 1973 Concession Agreements, so that the 1995 Settlement Agreement formed part of TexPet's \"overall investment agreement\" with Ecuador invoked under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty.34\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.20.\n\nThird Interim Award, paras 4.32-4.35.\n\n7.50.\n\nIn the First Partial Award, the Tribunal decided that Chevron was a \"co-Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, although it was not a signatory or named party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.35 In the Third Interim Award, the Tribunal also decided that Chevron was not a \"direct\" investor by reference to TexPet's Concession Agreements of 1964 and 1973: it was never a member of the Consortium; it was not an \"Operator\"; and it only appeared in the chronology of this case in 2001 following its \"merger\" with Texaco, long after the departure from Ecuador of TexPet and Texaco, in 1992.36 Hence, unlike TexPet, Chevron had no \"direct overall investment\" in Ecuador continuing from the 1964 Concession Agreement; and the 1995 Settlement Agreement, by itself, could not under the Treaty become in 2001 a \"direct\" investment by Chevron in Ecuador.37\n\nFirst Partial Award, para 112(1).\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.22.\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.23.\n\n7.51.\n\nTherefore, although both Chevron and TexPet were and remain \"co-Releasees\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with Texaco), Chevron is not in the same position as TexPet as an investor with a \"direct\" investment in Ecuador under the Treaty.\n\n7.52.\n\nFor these reasons, as recited below, the Tribunal did not make in the Third Interim Award any final decision upon the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to Chevron's claims with respect to any alleged \"direct\" investment by Chevron under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, as distinct from Chevron's \"indirect investment\" in TexPet, as TexPet's ultimate parent company following Chevron's \"merger\" with Texaco in 2001, under Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.38\n\nThird Interim Award, paras 4.27, 4.96 & 5.4.\n\n7.53.\n\nThus, in its Third Interim Award, the Tribunal drew a distinction between Chevron's \"direct\" and \"indirect\" investments. As to Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, the Tribunal decided (inter alia) as follows:39\n\n*\"4.24 In the Tribunal's view, as TexPet's parent company, Chevron is a covered investor under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT because it indirectly owns or controls an 'investment' in Ecuador. It is not disputed that Chevron is a company 'of the other Party' formed in the USA; and Article I(1)(a) does not require its indirect investment (i.e. in TexPet and its investment) to be a company formed in Ecuador. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides, as a matter of jurisdiction, that Chevron can bring its claims before this Tribunal for an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by the BIT with respect to its indirect 'investment' in TexPet.*\n\n*4.25 A different issue arises from Chevron's exposure to the liability to the plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Chevron became TexPet's parent and thus an investor in 2001 only, long after the events said to give rise to Chevron's liability and occurring at a time when Texaco (not Chevron) was TexPet's parent company. Notwithstanding their ostensibly distinct legal personalities and corporate histories, the Lago Agrio Litigation appears completely to amalgamate Chevron with Texaco (for legal reasons which remain unclear to the Tribunal). In that event, Chevron here submits for jurisdictional purposes that it should be treated by this Tribunal as, effectively, standing in the shoes of Texaco, as TexPet's parent company from 1964 onwards, with the same original investment indirectly made and continued by Texaco. Otherwise, so Chevron submits, the Respondent and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs could succeed unfairly in \"having it both ways\", with Chevron liable in the Lago Agrio litigation because of the concession/investment made by Texaco & TexPet but with Chevron not entitled in this arbitration to assert any relief because it had in fact no such investment/concession at the material time, i.e. before 2001.*\n\n*4.26 The Tribunal declines to cut this Gordian knot at this early stage of these arbitration proceedings: it will need a much better understanding of the legal reasons why Chevron is to be treated in the Lago Agrio Litigation as a party succeeding to Texaco's liabilities which arose before the \"merger\" in 2001; and it will also need a clearer understanding of what constituted such \"merger\" as regards the different and successive legal relationships between Texaco, TexPet and Chevron before and after such \"merger\", under whatever applicable law or laws, namely the laws of the USA and/or Ecuadorian law.*\n\n*4.27 Accordingly, for the time being, the Tribunal makes no final decision in regard to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection to Chevron's own claims as a direct investor under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, save to join that particular objection to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. In addition, the Tribunal's jurisdictional decision to treat Chevron as an indirect investor should not be understood as indicating (one way or the other) that Chevron would be entitled to all the relief claimed by Chevron in paragraph 547 of the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits (cited in Part I above). That is also a matter for the merits phase of this arbitration.\"*\n\nThird Interim Award, paras 4.24-4.27.\n\n7.54.\n\nAs to Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal also decided in the Third Interim Award to join that jurisdictional issue to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.40\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.53.\n\n7.55.\n\nThe Operative Part of this Third Interim Award, at Paragraph 5.4, provided as regards Chevron:41\n\n*\"As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or 'Chevron') in the Claimants' said Notice of Arbitration, [the Tribunal here decides] to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in its said memorials and further submissions, save those relating to the jurisdictional objections raised against the First Claimant as a[n] investor under Article I(1)(a) alleging a \"direct\" investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an \"investment agreement\" under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador\u2013USA Treaty of 27 August 1993 which are joined to the merits of the First Claimants' claims under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties' arbitration agreement under the Treaty.\"*\n\nThird Interim Award, para 5.4 (see also Annex 1 to Part I above).\n\n7.56.\n\nAccordingly, in summary, the Tribunal there joined to the merits the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to Chevron as an investor with a \"direct\" investment. The Parties subsequently agreed, and the Tribunal so ordered, that the Respondent's objections should be further addressed by the Parties and decided by the Tribunal in Track II of this arbitration.\n\n7.57.\n\nFor present purposes, therefore, the issue arises as to whether Chevron has any relevant \"investment\", \"investment agreement\" or \"investment dispute\" under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, permitting this Tribunal to decide Chevron's claims as a national of the USA under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including protection against denial of justice) or under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.58.\n\n*(3) The Respondent's Case:* In brief,42 the Respondent maintains several objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction (including, as to admissibility, its exercise of jurisdiction) to decide Chevron's claims under Articles II(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty.\n\nR-TII Mar. 2015, Sections II & III; see also the Third Interim Award, Parts 3(C) and 3(E).\n\n7.59.\n\nThese objections concern Chevron's alleged lack of any \"direct\" investment in Ecuador under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty; Chevron's limited interest as a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement; Chevron's several failures to exhaust its local remedies within the Ecuadorian legal system regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment, as required for denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (as also raised by the Tribunal) Chevron's amendment to its claims (with TexPet) for denial of justice regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment, pleaded after the commencement of this arbitration.43\n\nSee R-TII Mar. 2015, para 5 (whilst this pleading may not expressly take the point, the Tribunal thinks it right to so interpret it, as also to raise the point upon its own initiative: see below).\n\n7.60.\n\n*(4) The Claimant's Case* : In brief,44 the Claimants contend that the Tribunal has both jurisdiction to decide and (as to admissibility) may exercise such jurisdiction to decide Chevron's claims under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a), VI(1)(c), II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty, on several grounds.\n\nC-TII Jan. 2015, Section II; see also the Third Interim Award, Parts 3(D) and 3(F).\n\n7.61.\n\nChevron asserts (inter alia) that its indirect investment in TexPet is a sufficient \"investment\" to confer jurisdiction upon this Tribunal under the Treaty to decide its claims. Further, so Chevron contends, the Respondent should not be permitted to treat it (Chevron) differently from Texaco and TexPet under the Treaty, given the terms of the Lago Agrio Judgment merging their respective identities.45 As regards the exhaustion of local remedies, Chevron contends that the requirement under international law is not absolute for a claim for denial of justice; and that it reasonably availed itself of such remedies as ostensibly existed within the Ecuadorian legal system; but none offered at the time any reasonable, timely and effective prospect of success against the Lago Agrio Judgment. As for the amendment to its case to plead claims in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment, Chevron contends that such amendments were permissible under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, forming part of the Parties' Arbitration Agreement derived from the Treaty.\n\nSee Track II Hearing D1,165.\n\n***E: The Tribunal's Analysis as to Jurisdiction and Admissibility***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.62.\n\n*(1) Introduction:* It is appropriate to address separately the three parts of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction (with admissibility); namely: (i) Chevron's lack of any relevant \"investment\" under Articles I(1), II(3)(a), II(3)(c), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty; (ii) Chevron's alleged failure to exhaust local remedies in the Ecuadorian legal system for its claims regarding denial of justice in the Lago Agrio Litigation under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (as also raised by the Tribunal) (iii) the status of the Claimants' amended claims regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Treaty and Dutch law.\n\n7.63.\n\n*(2) Chevron:* The Tribunal decides, confirming its Third Interim Award, that Chevron cannot establish jurisdiction for its claims under Articles II(3)(a) or II(3)(c) of the Treaty by reference only to its own status as a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal there decided that, by itself, the 1995 Settlement Agreement is not a direct \"investment\" in Ecuador made by Chevron under Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n7.64.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides that Chevron cannot establish jurisdiction for its claims under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, based only on its own status as a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That provision requires the existence of an investment dispute \"between a Party [i.e. the Respondent] and a national or company of the other Party [i.e., here, Chevron] arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement made between that Party and such national or company\" (see the full wording set out in Section B of this Part VI above). Whilst there is, in the Tribunal's view, a dispute between Chevron and the Respondent arising out of or relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1995 Settlement Agreement is not an \"investment agreement\" made by Chevron itself.\n\n7.65.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to the interpretation and application of Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, regarding a dispute arising out of or relating to \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\"\n\n7.66.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty defines \"investment\", but not \"investor\"; and that the protection afforded under Article II(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty similarly addresses \"investments\", as does Article VI of the Treaty in regard to an \"investment dispute\" and \"investment\". The Preamble to the Treaty also records that it is \"a treaty concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments.\"\n\n7.67.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that Chevron had no investment under the Treaty before its \"merger\" with Texaco in 2001 (whether direct or indirect). However, with this \"merger\", Chevron acquired an interest in the investments made in Ecuador by TexPet and Texaco since 1964, including (as integral parts of their overall investments) the 1964 Concession, the 1973 Concession and the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In about 2001, as contended by the Respondent, Chevron also became a party (with Texaco) to Texaco's earlier undertaking to the US Courts in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction contained in Texaco's Notice of Agreement of 11 January 1999 in the Aguinda Litigation, leading to the Lago Agrio Litigation.46 In any event, Chevron became the sole named defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation, leading in turn to the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment of 17 March 2011, deciding that Chevron is bound by Texaco's undertaking of 1999: see Part IV(G)(1) above.\n\n7.68.\n\nThere is no issue between the Parties that Chevron is a 'company' of the USA as a Party to the Treaty, within the meaning of Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.69.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the meaning of the term \"investment\" in Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty is materially different than the term \"investor\". An \"investment\" identifies the subject-matter protected by the Treaty, as distinct from the person making that \"investment\". As a factual matter, Chevron never was a party making its own \"direct\" investment as an investor separate and distinct from the investments of Texaco and TexPet. Assessed as at 2001, however, Chevron acquired an \"indirect\" interest in TexPet's investments in Ecuador, satisfying (as regards Chevron) the definition of \"investment\" in Article I(1)(a) and Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, as applied to \"investments\" in Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) and also to an \"investment dispute\" as defined Article VI(1) of the Treaty.\n\n7.70.\n\nAccordingly, in the Tribunal's view, the dispute between Chevron and the Respondent is an investment dispute \"arising out of or related to \u2026 (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\" [namely Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty]. As already decided by the Tribunal, the phrase \"relating to\" is very broad in scope;47 and the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(a) is equally broad, encompassing \"every kind of investment [in Ecuador] \u2026. owned or controlled directly or indirectly\" by a claimant company.\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.15.\n\n7.71.\n\nThe Tribunal decides, therefore, that Chevron acquired a relevant \"investment\" in Ecuador under the Treaty sufficient to entitle it to invoke this Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide its claims under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty. Such an investment is not required by the Treaty to be a \"direct\" investment, still less an \"investment agreement\" made by Chevron itself.\n\n7.72.\n\n*(3) TexPet:* TexPet can assert in this arbitration its own rights under the Treaty in regard to its direct investments, including TexPet's own rights as a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement (forming an intrinsic part of TexPet's overall \"investment\" from 1964 onwards) under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.73.\n\nThe Third Interim Award decided, as regards TexPet:48\n\n*\"4.20 As a co-claimant in this arbitration, the Tribunal therefore decides that TexPet has standing (as a matter of jurisdiction) to seek its claimed declaratory, specific performance, moral damages and other relief against the Respondent, even though TexPet is not a defendant in the Lago Agro Litigation (or a defendant in the criminal proceedings). As an investor with a covered investment and as a contractual party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement with the Respondent, TexPet enjoys valuable economic rights for itself; and its claimed relief can thus include relief advanced under Articles I(1)(a)(v), Article II(3)(c), Article I(1)(a)(iii) and Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.\"*\n\nThird Interim Award, para 4.20.\n\n7.74.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, therefore, TexPet made a relevant investment under the Treaty sufficient to invoke this Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide its claims under the Treaty. Such an investment was a direct investment made by TexPet itself from 1964 onwards, in contrast to Chevron.\n\n7.75.\n\nFor two reasons, in the Tribunal's view, it would be no answer that TexPet has itself suffered no \"damage\" from the Lago Agrio Judgment, not being a named party to the Lago Agrio Litigation. First, damage is not required for an international wrong under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty: see Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.49 It suffices that TexPet with its \"investment\" has suffered an \"injury\". Such an injury was allegedly caused (inter alia) by the Respondent's international wrong committed by the Lago Agrio Court (as part of the Respondent's judicial branch) with the Lago Agrio Judgment, in violation of TexPet's release by the Respondent from any diffuse claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That wrong was allegedly repeated and maintained by the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts in upholding the Lago Agrio Judgment and by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court in rendering enforceable and maintaining the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nCrawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (2002), for the commentary on Article 31, at para 6 (p. 203), CLA-288.\n\n7.76.\n\nSecond, as alleged by the Claimants, TexPet has in any event suffered damage from the Lago Agrio Litigation and Lago Agrio Judgment. TexPet, albeit not a named defendant, was held publicly responsible in the Lago Agrio Judgment, with Chevron, for extensive environmental damage from 1964 onwards in the area of the concession. Consequentially, the Lago Agrio Judgment was successfully enforced against TexPet's assets in Ecuador, by the Lago Agrio Court's execution order of 15 October 2012.50\n\nC-1532. This asset comprised the modest sum of US$ 358.00: see the Claimants' letter dated 19 March 2018, p. 7 and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 4.\n\n7.77.\n\nUnder that order, the Court ordered, under paragraph (c), the attachment of \"all the funds deposited and existing in Banco Pichincha Checking Account No 30452125-04, as well as any other bank account, investment or fund owned by \u2026 Texaco Petroleum Company, Texpet \u2026\" and, under paragraph (f), \"\u2026 the total amount of (US$ 96,355,369) of the award against the Government of Ecuador in the arbitration proceedings brought by Chevron and Texaco [i.e. TexPet] with the Republic of Ecuador, publicly known as the 'Chevron Case II' [i.e. the Commercial Cases Arbitration]\". The Lago Agrio Court ordered this attachment of the award debt payable to TexPet (with Chevron) to be notified to the Respondent (as the award debtor), by order of 12 July 2016.51\n\nThe award debt was not recovered by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, owing (*inter alia*) to the settlement of the award debt made by the Respondent directly to Chevron and TexPet on 22 July 2016: see the Claimants' letter dated 19 March 2018, p. 8.\n\n7.78.\n\nSubject to other issues addressed later below, the Tribunal decides, therefore, that Chevron acquired a relevant \"investment\" under the Treaty sufficient to invoke this Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide its claims under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including its protection against denial of justice) and under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. Such an investment comprised Chevron's indirect interest, as from the date of the \"merger\" in 2001, in TexPet's \"overall\" investments from 1964 onwards (including the 1995 Settlement Agreement).\n\n7.79.\n\n*(4) Good Faith:* There is a third approach invoked by Chevron, somewhat more teleological, to address the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to Chevron's claims for lack of any relevant \"investment\" under Articles I(1), VI(1)(a), VI(1)(c), II(3)(a) and III(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.80.\n\nAs the Claimants contend, the Respondent cannot, in good faith, 'have it both ways' as regards Chevron's \"investment\" in Ecuador. If the Respondent, through its judicial branch, took the position that Chevron had assets in Ecuador, standing in the shoes of TexPet and Texaco as the Lago Agrio Judgment states, the Respondent cannot now adopt the position that Chevron never had any assets in Ecuador, i.e. that it never had any investments in Ecuador. The Lago Agrio Judgment amalgamates completely Chevron with TexPet and Texaco as result of the \"merger\", so as to hold Chevron liable for all wrongs committed by TexPet's and Texaco's activities in Ecuador from 1964 onwards. Yet the Respondent in this arbitration now seeks, improperly according to the Claimants, to disassociate Chevron in full from any of TexPet's and Texaco's activities in Ecuador (including investments), for tactical jurisdictional purposes.\n\n7.81.\n\nThe Claimants therefore conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Chevron's claims under Article VI(1)(a) and (c) of the Treaty \"because Chevron is entitled to all procedural and substantive legal rights and defences of TexPet, as a result of having been sued for TexPet's conduct as well as by reason of the [Lago Agrio] Court's improper amalgamation of Chevron with Texaco and TexPet.\"52\n\nC-TII Jan. 2015, para 31; see also *id.*, paras 275ff.\n\n7.82.\n\nIt is necessary to examine more closely the legal principles underlying the Claimants' submissions based upon on these apparent inconsistencies between the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) and the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in this arbitration. These inconsistencies and their legal effects are not accepted by the Respondent.\n\n7.83.\n\nThe Parties' obligations to resolve their dispute by consensual arbitration before an international tribunal derive from Article VI of the Treaty, subject to international law (as its applicable law). Under international law, as codified in Article 26 the Vienna Treaty on the Law of Treaties (the \"VCLT\"), parties are required to act in good faith in the performance of their obligations.\n\n7.84.\n\nArticle 26 of the VCLT provides:53 \"Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed in good faith\". The International Law Commission stated in its commentary to the VCLT that: \"In the case of treaties, \u2026 there is the special consideration that the parties by negotiating and concluding the treaty have brought themselves into a relationship in which there are particular obligations of good faith.\"54 In *Nuclear Tests* (1974), the International Court of Justice decided: \"One of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of good faith\".55 That was decided in regard to unilateral declarations made by a State. In the ILC's subsequent \"Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations\" (2006), the first guiding principle declared that the binding character of such unilateral declarations \"is based on good faith.\"56\n\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*, 23 May 1969, UN Doc.

The Parties' consent is contained in the separate Arbitration Agreement subject to international law between the Claimants and the Respondent, that was formed upon the Claimants' written acceptance (by their Notice of Arbitration) of the Respondent's standing, general offer to arbitrate contained in Article VI of the Treaty.57 Under international law, the Parties' Arbitration Agreement, made pursuant to Article VI(2) of the Treaty, is legally autonomous, or \"separable\", from other provisions of the Treaty.58 This is not a State-State arbitration under the Treaty (as to which the Treaty contains a separate provision in Article VII). This investor-State arbitration was therefore commenced by the Claimants in their own right, not deriving from the USA's espousal of their claims. Moreover, the Parties' Arbitration Agreement incorporates Article 21(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which recognises the legal autonomy of an arbitration provision physically, but not legally, contained in a substantive agreement. The Tribunal refers to the legal analysis of Article VI of the Treaty made by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment of 17 March 2011 in the New York Stay Legal Proceedings, to the effect that the Parties \"have created a separate binding agreement to arbitrate\" (see Part IV(G)(6) above).\n\nZ.

This obligation of good faith applies both to substantive provisions, such as Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c), but also to Article VI of the Treaty. Conversely, the Arbitration Agreement precludes conduct by any Party in bad faith, calculated to defeat the object and purpose of arbitration under Article VI of the Treaty: see, particularly, the Treaty's Preamble as to \"fair and equitable treatment of investment\" (set out in Part III(B) above), as interpreted under Article 31(1) of the VCLT. Moreover, where the lex arbitri is international law, the obligation of good faith as a general principle of international law (with the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute) applies to the Arbitration Agreement directly.\n\n7.87.\n\nThe general principle of good faith has a long history in regard to the conduct of dispute resolution, including arbitrations under international law, albeit under different nomenclatures. It has recently been confirmed by the ICSID award in *Orascom v Algeria* (2017),59 where the arbitration tribunal stated that it was \"undeniable\" that the doctrine of abuse of rights, or \"abus de proc\u00e9dure\", has a role to play in the conduct of an arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty, prohibiting the exercise of a \"right\" for purposes other than those for which that right was established; and that this doctrine was a general principle applicable in international law as well as in municipal law. In the Tribunal's view, such an abuse of rights includes an abusive want of good faith in the exercise of a procedural right, such as an objection to the jurisdiction of a tribunal under Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules derived from Article VI of the Treaty.\n\n*Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, paras 540, 541 & 547.\n\n7.88.\n\nFor present purposes, it is necessary to examine a specific want of good faith. Long before the VCLT, Lord McNair wrote, in his commentary on the *Fur Seal Arbitration* :60 \"\u2026 international jurisprudence has a place for some recognition of the principle that a State cannot blow hot and cold \u2013 *allegans contraria non audiendus est*.\"61 Dr Bin Cheng later wrote in his well-known work, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals*, under the similar heading \"*Allegans Contraria Non Est Audiendum\"* :62 \"It is a principle of good faith that \"a man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold \u2013 to affirm at one time and deny at another \u2026 Such a principle has its basis in common sense and common justice, and whether it is called 'estoppel' or by any other name, it is one which courts of law in modern times most usefully deployed.\"\n\n*Award between the United States and the United Kingdom relating to the rights of jurisdiction of the United States in the Bering's sea and the preservation of fur seals,* Ad hoc, Award, 15 August 1893, XXVIII RIAA 263 reprinted from J.B.

Professor Hersch Lauterpacht considered that estoppel under international law was based upon a general principle of good faith: \"It is of little consequence whether the rule is based on what in English law is known as the principle of estoppel or the more generally conceived requirement of good faith. The former is probably no more than one of the aspects of the latter.\"63 Professor Bowett also wrote: \"The rule of estoppel, whether treated as a rule of evidence or as a rule of substantive law, operates so as to preclude a party from denying before a tribunal the truth of a statement of fact made previously by that party to another whereby that other has acted to his detriment or the party making the statement has secured some benefit. The basis of the rule is the general principle of good faith and as such finds a place in many systems of law.\"64\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Law of Treaties, Report by Mr H.

Thus it has been held that a State cannot be heard to repudiate liability for a collision after its authorities on the spot had at the time admitted liability and sought throughout to make the most advantageous arrangements for the Government under the circumstances. Again, if a State, having been fully informed of the circumstances, has accepted a person's claim to the ownership of certain property and entered into negotiation with him for its purchase, it becomes 'very difficult, if not impossible' for that State subsequently to allege that he had no title at the time. If a State, which is the lessee of a property owned by two joint owners, has, after the death of one of them, paid the entire rent to the other, who claims to have become the sole owner, 'this act can not be interpreted otherwise than as a recognition by the authorities of the fact that the right of ownership of Hassar [the deceased] has passed to Raini [the claimant].' Where a party negotiates for the sublease of a concession granted by a State, it thereby recognises the validity of the concession and the right of the State to grant it \u2026\"*\n\nB.

He concluded his historical survey of legal materials, as follows:\n\n*\"What appears to be the common denominator of the various aspects of estoppel which have been discussed, is the requirement that a State ought to maintain towards a given factual or legal situation an attitude consistent with that which it was known to have adopted with regard to the same circumstances on previous occasions. At its simplest, estoppel in international law reflects the possible variations, in circumstances and effects, of the underlying principle of consistency which may be summed up in the maxim allegans contraria non audiendus est. \u2026\".*\n\nI. MacGibbon, \"Estoppel in International Law\" (1958) 7 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 468, p. 45, CLA-107.\n\n7.92.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections of 26 July 2010,67 the Respondent cited the Decision of the German-Poland mixed arbitration tribunal (\"T.A.M.\") in *Kunkel v Poland* (1926) regarding the inconsistent conduct of the respondent State (Poland) in that mixed arbitration.68 Professor Bowett relied upon this Decision in his 1957 article, \"Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence\".69 As explained below, the Decision is not a case on \"estoppel\".70\n\nR-Jur.

Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, paras 125-131, CLA-1. The tribunal there joined the issue of good faith to the merits where, so it appears, it did not prevail on the facts found by the tribunal. (The *Kunkel* case had been cited earlier in the Iran-USA Claims Tribunal's award of 29 June 1989 in *Phillips Petroleum Co. Iran v. Islamic Republic of Iran and National Iranian Oil Company*, IUSCT Case No. 39, Award No. 425-39-2, 29 June 1989, p. 108, fn 39, RLA-71, as barring \"a party's contradictory and self-serving jurisdictional statements\". Professor Bowett QC had there acted as Counsel for the respondents).\n\n*Kunkel et. al. v.

The Respondent cited this case on an issue different from the jurisdictional issue here under consideration.\n\nD. Bowett, \"Estoppel before International Tribunals and its Relation to Acquiescence\" (1957) 33 British Yearbook of International Law 176, p. 187, CLA-179.\n\nThe edited summary of the *Kunkel* decision in the *Annual Digest* prepared in English by Hersch Lauterpacht uses the word \"estopped\"; but that word is not used as an English legal term of art, as appears from the original French text below, taken from the full report in the *Recueil.*\n\n7.93.\n\nAs reported, the relevant facts were as follows: Under the Treaty of Versailles, Poland had the right to liquidate the property of German nationals situated within its territory. However, the Treaty also provided that former nationals of Germany, who by virtue of the Treaty had acquired Polish nationality, were not to be regarded as German nationals.71 Poland proceeded to liquidate the property of the claimants as German nationals. These claimants contended that they had acquired Polish nationality and that their property was, therefore, not liable to such liquidation. The tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction to decide claims put forward against Poland by Polish nationals. Hence, the tribunal rejected the claimants' claims pleaded as Polish nationals. However, the tribunal also decided that it was open to the claimants to amend their claims on the basis that they were German nationals (within the same arbitration proceedings). Having liquidated their estates on the ground that they were German nationals, Poland could not deny their German nationality in the arbitration, it being required by the Versailles Treaty that a person who had suffered damage as a German national should not be deprived of legal remedies afforded by the Treaty to German nationals.\n\n*Treaty of Versailles (Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany)*, 28 June 1919, UKTS 4 (1919), CMD 153, Chapter V, Property Rights and Interests, Section IV provides (with square brackets here added): *Article 297: \"The question of private property, rights and interests in an enemy country shall be settled according to the principles laid down in this Section and to the provisions of the Annex hereto. \u2026*  \n*(b) [1] Subject to any contrary stipulations which may be provided for in the present Treaty, the Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right to retain and liquidate all property, rights and interests belonging at the date of the coming into force of the present Treaty to German nationals, or companies controlled by them, within their territories, colonies, possessions and protectorates including territories ceded to them by the present Treaty*. *[2] The liquidation shall be carried out in accordance with the laws of the Allied or Associated State concerned, and the German owners shall not be able to dispose of such property, rights or interests nor to subject them to any charge without the consent of that State. [3] German nationals who acquire ipso facto the nationality of an Allied or Associated Power in accordance with the provisions of the present Treaty will not be considered as German nationals within the meaning of this paragraph.\"*\n\n7.94.\n\nThe Decision was issued in the French language only. The words \"estoppel\" and \"estopped\", albeit an Anglo-Saxon legal concept expressed in Norman-French, are not French words, still less French legal terms of art. The relevant passage in the Decision's authentic text in French, provides as follows:\n\n*\"8. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le Tribunal doit se d\u00e9clarer incomp\u00e9tent pour statuer sur les conclusions des requ\u00e9rants telles qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es et motiv\u00e9es. Il y a lieu toutefois de faire l'importante r\u00e9serve suivante:*\n\n*Si les requ\u00e9rants renoncent \u00e0 fonder leurs r\u00e9clamations contre l'Etat polonais sur leur pr\u00e9tendue qualit\u00e9 de ressortissants polonais, s'ils se bornent \u00e0 invoquer les droits assur\u00e9s par le Trait\u00e9 aux ressortissants allemands liquid\u00e9s, c'est-\u00e0-dire s'ils r\u00e9clament l'indemnit\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire pr\u00e9vue par l'art. 297. litt. h, et par l'art, 92, ch. 2, ou, \u00e9ventuellement, s'ils contestent l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la liquidation pour un motif autre que leur ressortissance polonaise, les consid\u00e9rations d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es ci-dessus cesseront d'\u00eatre applicables. Le Tribunal n'aura pas \u00e0 rechercher d'office si les requ\u00e9rants sont Allemands ou Polonais; il devra au point de, vue de sa comp\u00e9tence, les tenir pour Allemands puisque c'est en raison de cette qualit\u00e9 qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 liquid\u00e9s et que, d'autre part, la pr\u00e9tendue ressortissance polonaise ne constituera plus la base juridique de la r\u00e9clamation. Et l'Etat polonais ne pourra naturellement pas exciper de la ressortissance polonaise des requ\u00e9rants pour d\u00e9cliner la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, puisqu'il les a trait\u00e9s comme Allemands et qu'ils ne revendiqueront pas autre chose que les droits garantis aux ressortissants allemands. La condition de nationalit\u00e9 allemande essentielle pour la comp\u00e9tence du T.A.M. sera donc, dans cette hypoth\u00e8se, cens\u00e9e r\u00e9alis\u00e9e. Cette solution est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence des T.A.M. (Cf. Recueil, t. III, p. 1017-1018 et p. 606) et elle se justifie par des raisons d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e9videntes: celui qui a subi un dommage en sa qualit\u00e9 d'Allemand doit pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des droits attach\u00e9s \u00e0 cette qualit\u00e9, notamment de celui de saisir le T.A.M..*\n\n*Strictement, les nouvelles conclusions ainsi r\u00e9serv\u00e9es devraient faire l'objet de nouvelles requ\u00eates, puisque leur fondement juridique diff\u00e9rera de celui des conclusions actuelles. Cependant, dans un but de simplification, on peut autoriser les requ\u00e9rants \u00e0 proc\u00e9der, dans les deux mois, par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de m\u00e9moires qui seront joints aux dossiers d\u00e9j\u00e0 constitu\u00e9s et auxquels l'Etat d\u00e9fendeur aura un d\u00e9lai de deux mois pour r\u00e9pondre, l'\u00e9change d'\u00e9critures \u00e9tant ensuite termin\u00e9. Ce n'est que si les conclusions en question ne peuvent \u00eatre prises utilement dans le d\u00e9lai indiqu\u00e9 (par exemple parce que la liquidation ne serait pas encore achev\u00e9e) que les requ\u00e9rants devront d\u00e9poser de nouvelles requ\u00eates.\"*\n\n7.95.\n\nWhilst the tribunal invoked \"*des raisons d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e9videntes*\" and did not refer expressly to bad faith or 'blowing hot and cold', this Decision can only be understood as resting upon Poland's lack of good faith in taking, unequivocally, starkly inconsistent positions towards the same claimants at different times, to their detriment and to Poland's benefit.\n\n7.96.\n\nIn his 1957 article, Professor Bowett concluded that \"[m]any of the cases on estoppel by conduct illustrate the simple principle that the law will demand consistency in conduct where the result of inconsistency would be to prejudice another party\".72 In support of this conclusion, Professor Bowett cited not only *Kunkel* (1925)73 but also a lengthy study on related forms of estoppel under the laws of the USA published in the Harvard Law Review (1951-1952).74\n\nD.

This is a form of estoppel based on the conduct of the party rather than the court, in which respect it is similar to election of remedies. The preclusion, like election of remedies, preferably should not be applied where the first position taken did not harm or cause reliance by the other party. Unlike res judicata, it operates regardless of finality of the original proceedings or identity of the parties, and it applies only to positions taken on the facts, not inconsistent points of law. Some courts apply the rule only where the position was successfully maintained, while others do not require success if the second action has some connection with the first. The preclusion seems an undesirable restriction against decision on the merits in the second action where it is applied to facts that were not major issues in the first action, or to facts that were conjectural at the time. [Footnote 30]\"*\n\n(Footnote 30 states: *\"It has been suggested that the doctrine might generally be mitigated by using the prior position as an admission, not a preclusion, so that the trier of fact in the second case could decide on the merits between the two positions asserted. See Note, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 1132, 1136 (1946)\"*).\n\nHarvard Law Review, \"Developments in the Law of Res Judicata\" (1951-1952) 65 Harvard Law Review 818, pp. 823-824.\n\n7.98.\n\nThis principle of preclusion from a party's inconsistent positions was confirmed by the US Supreme Court in *New Hampshire v Maine* (2001).76 In that case, the US Supreme Court decided, applying \"judicial estoppel\", that New Hampshire was \"equitably barred from asserting \u2013 contrary to its position in the 1970's litigation \u2013 that the inland Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore\".\n\n*New Hampshire v. Maine*, 532 U.S. 742 (29 May 2001).\n\n7.99.\n\nWhile they are relevant to the establishment of 'judicial estoppel' as a general principle of international law (applicable here under Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute), in other circumstances, the Tribunal would not be minded to cite such municipal legal materials in such detail in support of its approach under international law. In this case, however, there is good reason to do so in the light of the Parties' own joint experiences of these materials directly related to this arbitration, particularly the Respondent's successful invocation of preclusion, or \"judicial estoppel\", from contradictory statements made by Chevron to different US courts.\n\n7.100.\n\nIn disputes between the Claimants and the Respondent in US legal proceedings directly related to this arbitration, this principle of preclusion, or \"judicial estoppel\", based on a party's inconsistent statements, was applied by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n7.101.\n\nThe first of these judgments was issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 17 March 2011 in *Republic of Ecuador v Chevron Corporation and TexPet* in the US Stay Proceedings.77 It related to the application by the Respondent to the US Courts for an order staying this arbitration under the Treaty: see Part IV(G)(6) above. The Tribunal has already addressed the Second Circuit's judgment; and it is unnecessary to do so here again, save to note that the Court applied \"judicial estoppel\".78 The Court described the purpose of \"judicial estoppel\", citing the US Supreme Court, as protecting \"the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment\".79\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v.

That application was resisted by Mr Connor (with GSI), supported by Chevron.\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v. John A. Connor et. al., 2013 W1 539011 (C.A.5 (Tex.)) (5th Cir. 13 February 2013),* RLA-432.\n\n7.103.\n\nIn its judgment granting the Respondent's application, the Court (per Jones J) applied the principle of \"judicial estoppel\":81\n\n*\"Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine designed to protect the integrity of judicial proceedings by preventing litigants from asserting contradictory positions for tactical gain. The precise rationale for and consequences of the doctrine vary. 18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4477 (2d ed. 2002 & Supp. 2012) (hereinafter 'Wright & Miller). Recognizing this, the Supreme Court examined the doctrine extensively in New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001), but in the end refused to establish an 'inflexible formula.' Relying instead on several factors that often indicate the propriety of the sanction, the Court held that a party may be estopped from asserting a position in a judicial proceeding where it has previously persuaded a court to adopt a clearly contradictory position to the disadvantage of an opponent. See also Reed v. City of Arlington, 650 F.3d 571 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc). Reed also notes, 'Because judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, courts may apply it flexibly to achieve substantial justice.' Id. at 576.\"*\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v. John A. Connor et. al., 2013 W1 539011 (C.A.5 (Tex.)) (5th Cir. 13 February 2013),* pp. 3-4, RLA-432.\n\n7.104.\n\nThe Court decided that there was an inconsistency in Chevron's statements regarding the status of this arbitration under the Treaty as a 'foreign or international tribunal' within the meaning of Section 1782. In other legal proceedings under Section 1782, Chevron (as the applicant) had successfully asserted that this arbitration fell within the legislative definition, whereas in these particular proceedings Chevron (resisting the Respondent's application) was asserting the contrary. As the judgment states: \"Why shouldn't sauce for Chevron's goose be sauce for the Ecuador gander as well?\"82 The answer to this question, in addition to other matters decided by the Court, was that it should.\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v. John A. Connor et. al., 2013 W1 539011 (C.A.5 (Tex.)) (5th Cir. 13 February 2013),* p. 4, RLA-432.\n\n7.105.\n\nThe Tribunal does not seek here to apply the doctrine of \"judicial estoppel\" as recognised by the laws of the USA. International law, not the laws of the USA, is the applicable law in this arbitration. However, it is clear that the mischief which this US doctrine seeks to remedy, by its own nomenclature, is the same as the mischief to be remedied under international law; namely: a deliberate want of good faith by a party's inconsistent statements calculated to thwart the integrity of the judicial process for its own benefit and to the other party's prejudice. As Dr Bin Cheng stated (quoted above), the remedy \"has its basis in common sense and common justice\"; or, more colloquially in the words of the Fifth Circuit, sauce for the goose should also be sauce for the gander.\n\n7.106.\n\nApplying Article 26 of the VCLT and customary international law, the Tribunal decides that the Parties are bound to act in good faith in the exercise of their rights and the performance of their respective obligations under the Arbitration Agreement derived from Article VI of the Treaty. That duty of good faith precludes clearly inconsistent statements, deliberately made for one party's material advantage or to the other's material prejudice, that adversely affect the legitimacy of the arbitral process. In other words, no party to this arbitration can 'have it both ways' or 'blow hot and cold', to affirm a thing at one time and to deny that same thing at another time according to the mere exigencies of the moment.\n\n7.107.\n\nThe Tribunal here bases its decision on the general principle of good faith under international law applied to the Parties' obligations under their Arbitration Agreement, rather than upon any specific doctrine derived from the Anglo-Saxon concept of equitable estoppel by conduct or representation. Dr Bin Cheng recognised that, although estoppel is consistent with the general principle of good faith, it is a different doctrine under international law. As Lord McNair wrote in regard to *The Fur Seal Arbitration* (above), that decision did not involve \"*estoppel eo nomine*\", but a broader principle precluding a State, in his words, from 'blowing hot and cold'; i.e. the principle of good faith.\n\n7.108.\n\nThe Lago Agrio Court, by the Lago Agrio Judgment, treated Chevron following the \"merger\" with Texaco in 2001, as legally indistinct from Texaco and TexPet (as described in Part V above). In particular, it was there decided (inter alia): \" \u2026 the obligation to submit to Ecuadorian justice pending on Texaco Inc. was also transmitted to new company Chevron Texaco Corporation, *so that consequently Chevron Corp. cannot allege that it never operated in Ecuador to give grounds for lack of a legitimate opposing party*\" (see Lines 299 to 302 of Annex 7 to Part V, emphasis here supplied). In other words, the Lago Agrio Judgment treated Chevron as if, like TexPet, it had operated in Ecuador from 1964 onwards as a party to the Concession Agreements of 1964 and 1973, with significant assets in Ecuador. Thus, according to the Lago Agrio Judgment (as upheld by the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation Courts), Chevron had assets equating to to investments in Ecuador from 1964 onwards.\n\n7.109.\n\nThese statements were unequivocally made in the Lago Agrio Judgment and left intact by the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts, forming part of the judicial branch of the Respondent. The acts of its judicial branch are attributable to the Respondent under international law: Article 4(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The position of the Respondent by its judicial branch contrasts starkly with the position of the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n7.110.\n\nHere, for its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent seeks to distinguish between the respective legal personalities of Chevron and TexPet (as also Texaco). The Respondent then seeks to draw, under Articles 1(1), II(3)(a), II(3)(c), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty as regards relevant \"investments\", a material difference between Chevron on the one hand and TexPet (with Texaco) on the other. The Respondent contends unequivocally that, unlike TexPet, Chevron never had any presence in Ecuador, with no assets and no relevant investment in Ecuador. As described above, that difference is contradicted in the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n7.111.\n\nIt is impossible for the Tribunal to reconcile the statements in the Lago Agrio Judgment as to the \"merger\" between Chevron, TexPet and Texaco with the submissions made by the Respondent in this arbitration. The Respondent's jurisdictional objections to Chevron's claims are manifestly inconsistent with the unequivocal statements made by the Respondent's own judicial branch in treating Chevron with TexPet and Texaco for all their activities in Ecuador from 1964 onwards.\n\n7.112.\n\nApplying the principle of good faith under international law to the exercise of rights and the performance of obligations under the Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal decides that it is impermissible for the Respondent to 'blow hot and cold' or to 'have it both ways', to Chevron's detriment and to the Respondent's benefit. In other words, the Respondent cannot now defeat, under the principle of good faith, the object and purpose of the Arbitration Agreement derived from Article VI of the Treaty with a jurisdictional objection under Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules treating Chevron so differently from TexPet and Texaco as regards assets and, therefore, \"investments\" in Ecuador from 1964 onwards. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is required in this arbitration, as a matter of good faith, to treat Chevron as 'standing in the shoes' of TexPet (with Texaco), consistently with the statements made and acted upon by the Respondent's judicial branch in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n7.113.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken fully into account that the principle of good faith may be more cautiously applied to justify a tribunal's jurisdiction, as compared to other non-jurisdictional issues. Nevertheless, there is no reason why the same principle of good faith should not apply to jurisdiction (or admissibility), as well as to the merits. It did so in the *Kunkel* arbitration decided almost a century ago (1926).\n\n7.114.\n\nAccordingly, subject to other issues addressed later below, the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction over Chevron's claims under of the Treaty, as it does for TexPet's claims, under Articles VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.115.\n\n*(5) The Tribunal's Conclusion as to \"Investment\":* For these several reasons, subject to the following issues, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants' cases as regards a relevant investment suffice to meet the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to the Claimants' claims under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including protection against denial of justice) and the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n7.116.\n\n*(6) Judicial Finality (Local Remedies)* : As to the second part of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, there is no suggestion in this case that any requirement as to judicial finality has been waived by the Respondent, whether in the Treaty or otherwise. It therefore applies to the Claimants' claims for denial of justice made under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n7.117.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is well settled that a claimant asserting a claim for denial of justice committed by a State's judicial system must satisfy, whether as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility, a requirement as to the exhaustion of local remedies or, as now better expressed, a substantive rule of judicial finality.83 Even the grossest misconduct by a lower court or manifest unfairness in its procedures is not by itself sufficient to amount to a denial of justice by a State, unless the judicial remedies that exist in that State either do not correct the deficiencies in the lower court's judgment (once exhausted by the foreign national) or are such that none affords to the foreign national any reasonable prospect of correcting those deficiencies in a timely, fair and effective manner.\n\nJ. Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (2002), explains that a claim is inadmissible if any available and effective local remedy has not been exhausted \"when the claim is one to which the rule of exhaustion of local remedies applies\" (Article 44). The rule does not, of course, apply where an initial defect in a lower is corrected by an appellate court because there can then be no claim for denial of justice. The Tribunal also acknowledges the scholarly debate between the two concepts underlying this rule: the procedural concept and the substantive concept. In the absence of waiver, that debate is not relevant to the present case; and the Tribunal does not therefore need to address it here.\n\n7.118.\n\nIn brief,84 as already summarised above, Chevron contends that it has met the requirement of judicial finality, by its successive but unsuccessful appeals before the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation Court and (most recently) the Constitutional Court. The Claimants' counsel, Professor Paulsson, acknowledged that an international wrong for denial of justice does not occur until reasonable attempts have been made by the wronged claimant to secure the local remedies available within the State's own local legal system. However, Professor Paulson also submitted that a claimant is not required to exhaust any local remedy that offers no reasonable prospect of success. The requirement is limited to \"reasonable attempts\" to right the wrong within the State's own legal system.85\n\nC-TI Jan. 2014, Section III.D; and C-TII Jan. 2015, Sections VIII, IX and X.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,144ff; see also J. Paulsson, *Denial of Justice* (2005), p. 130, RLA-61.\n\n7.119.\n\nIn brief,86 as also summarised above, the Respondent contends that Chevron has not met the requirement of judicial finality, thereby precluding its claims for denial of justice *in limine* (whether as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility).\n\nR-TII Feb. 2013, paras 220ff.\n\n7.120.\n\nAt the Track II Hearing, the Respondent's Counsel, Professor Mayer, accepted that a judicial remedy would not need to be pursued \"in the absence of a reasonable possibility of effective redress.\"87 The Respondent contends that Chevron failed reasonably to pursue its effective legal remedies within the Ecuadorian legal system, particularly (as regards the alleged denial of justice) under the Ecuadorian Collusion Prosecution Act (the \"CPA\"). The Respondent also contends that Chevron's failure to request the Lago Agrio Appellate Court to fix the amount of a bond and to pay such bond, so as to suspend the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment, led to the alleged injury of which the Claimants complain. It was, according to the Respondent, \"an intervening direct and immediate cause of the enforceability of the Judgment, breaking the 'causal nexus' required for a showing of denial of justice\".88 At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent also invoked Chevron's incomplete proceedings before the Constitutional Court, a submission no longer relevant with the Constitutional Court's Judgment of 27 June 2018.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,211.\n\nR-TII Feb. 2013, para 225; R-TII Nov. 2014, para 239.\n\n7.121.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the classic statement as to judicial finality in the final award of the NAFTA tribunal in *Loewen v USA* (2003), where the claimants were held to have failed to comply with the substantive rule of judicial finality by not appealing to the US Supreme Court:89\n\n*\"154. No instance has been drawn to our attention in which an international tribunal has held a State responsible for a breach of international law constituted by a lower court decision when there was available an effective and adequate appeal within the State's legal system.\"*\n\n*\"156. The purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower court be challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a breach of international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the State the opportunity of redressing through its legal system the inchoate breach of international law occasioned by the lower court decision \u2026\"*\n\n*\"215. Here we encounter the central difficulty in Loewen's case. Loewen failed to present evidence disclosing its reasons for entering into the settlement agreement in preference to pursuing other options, in particular the [US] Supreme Court option \u2026\"*\n\n*\"217. Accordingly, our conclusion is that Loewen failed to pursue its domestic remedies, notably the Supreme Court option and that, in consequence, Loewen has not shown a violation of customary international law and a violation of NAFTA for which Respondent is responsible.\"*\n\nThis decision was made unanimously by three eminent and experienced jurists, of great renown. It remains the lodestar relevant to the specific issue here under consideration.90 The Tribunal does not understand from the Parties' submissions that there exists any material difference between them as to the applicable legal principle, as expressed in *Loewen*. Their differences arise from its application to the facts of the present case.\n\n*Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Final Award, 26 June 2003, paras 154, 156, 215 & 217, CLA-44; see also Decision on Hearing of Respondent's Objection to Competence and Jurisdiction, 5 January 2001, CLA-425; Decision on Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision, 6 September 2004, CLA-643; *Loewen v. United States,* No. 04-2151, Mem. Op. (D.C. 31 October 2005), CLA-644.\n\nThe same approach was taken in *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, paras 256-258, CLA-230 (The ICSID tribunal included Professor Mayer, who preaches what he practises); as also in *Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers (Greece) v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, para 96, RLA-17 (The ICSID tribunal comprised a sole arbitrator, Professor Paulsson, who also preaches what he practises).\n\n7.122.\n\nFor the present case, the Tribunal considers that the crucial part of the statements in *Loewen,* is that the availability of a local remedy \"is not a standard to be determined or applied in the abstract. It means reasonably available to the complainant in light of its situation\u2026.\"91 As also stated above, the local remedy must be available as \"an effective and adequate appeal within the State's legal system.\" It clearly does not include any ineffective or inadequate or, equally, any untimely remedy. The test is similarly expressed in the later awards in *Jan de Nul* (2008) and *Pantechniki* (2009) *.*\n\n*Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Final Award, 26 June 2003, para 169, CLA-44.\n\n7.123.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the overall test for such availability is that of reasonableness applied to the complainant, assessed at the relevant time. Applied to the present case, it would be wrong in principle to require Chevron to have pursued at the time any local remedy in Ecuador that lacked any reasonable prospect of a timely, effective and adequate protection against the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and, especially, without Ecuador. As with all its allegations, the legal burden of proving such ineffective protection, once a potential procedure has been identified by the Respondent, rests upon Chevron under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.124.\n\nIn the light of the statements in *Loewen*, the Tribunal addresses the application of this requirement of judicial finality to: (i) the Bond, (ii) the CPA and (iii) the Constitutional Court, as invoked by the Respondent.\n\n7.125.\n\n*(i) The Bond:* The enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment was suspended pending Chevron's appeal to the Lago Agrio Appellate Court. The Appellate Court issued its judgment, dismissing Chevron's appeal from the Lago Agrio Judgment, on 3 January 2012.92 It issued its Clarification Order on 13 January 2012.93 On 20 January 2012, Chevron filed a cassation appeal with the Appellate Court (of some 176 pages). Chevron there requested the Appellate Court (inter alia) to suspend the enforcement of its judgment (thereby continuing the suspension of the Lago Agrio Judgment's enforcement) and to declare that there was no requirement for Chevron to post a bond to suspend the Appellate Court's Judgment.94\n\nC-991.\n\nC-2314; R-299.\n\nC-1068, Section C: \"Suspension of Enforcement of Judgment pending Resolution of the International Arbitration pursued by Chevron against the Republic of Ecuador\" (pp. 160ff).\n\n7.126.\n\nOn 17 February 2012, the Appellate Court refused Chevron's request to suspend the enforcement of its judgment pending Chevron's cassation appeal. The Appellate Court decided also that its judgment would have been suspended pending the cassation appeal (thereby suspending the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment) if Chevron had requested the posting of a bond and had posted a bond, which it had not done.95 On 24 February 2012, Chevron requested the Appellate Court to revoke its order of 17 February 2012.96 By order of 1 March 2012, the Appellate Court rejected Chevron's request, confirming the non-suspension of its judgment. It thereby declared the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment.97\n\nSee C-1114, p. 5.\n\nC-1114.\n\nC-1114 (updated).\n\n7.127.\n\nBy the time of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court's order of 1 March 2012, this Tribunal, in order to preserve the rights of the Parties pending its decision on the merits, had already issued interim measures requiring the Respondent (including its judicial branch) not to permit the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment: see its Orders and Interim Awards on Interim Measures of 28 January 2011, 9 February 2011, 16 March 2011, 25 January 2012 and 16 February 2012.98 As already indicated above, the Tribunal had secured Chevron's cross-undertaking in damages for these interim measures with an order that the Claimants pay US$ 50 million to the PCA, which was duly paid by the Claimants and is held to the order of the Tribunal in this arbitration.\n\nThese are listed in Annex 1 to Part I of this Award.\n\n7.128.\n\nOne of the grounds invoked by Chevron in support of its application of 20 January 2012 to the Lago Agrio Appellate Court was that the effect of this Tribunal's orders and awards, particularly its Order of 9 February 2011, was that the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment was \"currently suspended\" by the Tribunal. At page 160 of its cassation appeal, Chevron pleaded:\n\n*\"(a) That the appellate judgment shall not be enforced because its enforcement is currently suspended by order of the Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague;*\n\n*(b) That, as a consequence of the foregoing, the [Appellate Court] declare that there is no requirement to post a bond to suspend enforcement of the judgment; \u2026*\n\n*(d) That the [Appellate Court] Clerk refrain from certifying that the judgment is enforceable;*\n\n*(e) That in the court order by which the Appellate Court declares that enforcement of the judgment is currently suspended, it orders the enforcement judge to refrain from issuing any order that initiates a proceeding for enforcement of the same; \u2026\"*\n\n7.129.\n\nOn 30 May 2012, consistent with the order of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court of 1 March 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs began enforcement proceedings in Canada, followed by enforcement proceedings in Brazil on 27 June 2012. On 3 August 2012, the Lago Agrio Court (i.e. the enforcement judge) ordered the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in the total amount of US$ 19,041,414,529.00, payable by Chevron within 24 hours.99\n\nC-1404.\n\n7.130.\n\nThe Respondent (by its judicial branch), in declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment to be enforceable with the Lago Agrio Appellate Court's order of 1 March 2012 and the Lago Agrio Court's enforcement order of 3 August 2012, did not comply with this Tribunal's Orders and Interim Awards.100\n\nIn its Fourth Interim Award, the Tribunal decided that the Lago Agrio Judgment was made \"final, enforceable and subject to execution within Ecuador by the Respondent no later than 3 August 2012\". The Tribunal relied (inter alia) upon the Respondent's submissions at the hearing on 11 February 2012 (see February Hearing D1,167ff). For present purposes, the difference of some four months between 1 March and 3 August 2012 is not material.\n\n7.131.\n\nThe Tribunal recognised at the time of its orders and awards (as it does still) that national courts have legal responsibilities to discharge under their State's laws and constitution; that the exercise of such responsibilities may impinge upon the rights of third parties; and that in this new world of interaction between international tribunals and national courts, there is a need to proceed with mutual respect and sensitivity to each other's functions. Nonetheless, when the State has chosen to establish procedures in parallel to its national court system (as it has here under the Treaty), it is incumbent on the State to ensure that the commitments that it has agreed are not defeated or subverted by actions of its national agencies, including its judicial branch.\n\n7.132.\n\nBefore 1 March 2012, as already indicated, this Tribunal had ordered the Respondent, under its several orders and awards on interim measures, not to declare the Lago Agrio Judgment enforceable. Chevron was entitled to rely upon those orders and awards, which were legally binding upon the Respondent under the Arbitration Agreement to which the Respondent had decided to commit itself. Moreover, given that the Respondent (by its judicial branch) knowingly did not comply with these orders and awards, it would inappropriate for the Respondent now to profit from its own wrong under the general principle of international law known by its Latin maxim: *nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria.101*\n\nB. Cheng, *General Principles of Law, as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (1953, reprinted 1987), p. 149, CLA-108.\n\n7.133.\n\nThe Tribunal also relies upon two further factors. First, at the time (after the Lago Agrio Appellate Court's judgment), there were insufficient prospects of favourable relief on Chevron's appeal to the Cassation Court. Such a cassation appeal could not be a full appeal addressing Chevron's multiple complaints regarding the Lago Agrio Litigation and Lago Agrio Judgment. Apart from relief against punitive damages ordered by the Lago Agrio Judgment, this was later to prove to be the case.\n\n7.134.\n\nSecond, the amount of the bond would, on the case advanced by both the Claimants and the Respondent, have been so high as to amount to a practical denial of access to the Cassation Court by Chevron. Dr Coronel testified that the amount of the bond would have been between US$ 1.9 billion and US$ 14.6 billion.102 At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent's Counsel stated that the amount of the bond would have been fixed in an amount between 1% and 5% of the amounts at stake.103 Applied to the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Appellate Court in the total sum of US$ 18 billion, the amount of the bond would have been between US$ 180 million and US$ 14.6 billion. These are not trifling amounts.\n\nCoronel ER 5, paras 16 & 113.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,221.\n\n7.135.\n\nIn the circumstances prevailing at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to require Chevron to have posted a bond of this size so as to suspend the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate Judgment. Moreover, upon the exhaustion of Chevron's appellate remedies with the Constitutional Court's Judgment of 27 June 2018, the failure to post a bond has now no legal significance: such a bond could only have suspended the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment pending the completion of the appellate process; and the failure to exhaust a local remedy does not extinguish the underlying international wrong.\n\n7.136.\n\n*(ii) The Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA):* Under Article 6 of the Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA), a party claiming to be the victim of collusive legal proceedings before an Ecuadorian Court may impugn the resulting judgment. It provides: \"If the grounds for the claim are confirmed, measures to void the collusive proceeding will be issued, invalidating the act or acts \u2026 and redressing the harm caused\u2026 and, as a general matter, restoring the things to the state prior to the collusion\". Articles 4 and 5 of the CPA permit the complaining party to present evidence and participate in a hearing under the CPA; and Articles 6 and 7 specify the CPA's remedies, including the judgment's nullification, damages against and imprisonment of the miscreants.104\n\nLey para el Juzgamiento de la Colusion (Collusion Prosecution Act), as amended on 9 March 2009, Registro Oficial 269 de 3 de febrero de 1977 (Ecuador), RLA-493. The CPA's relevant provisions are set out in full above in Part III of this Award, with both the English translation and the Spanish original text.\n\n7.137.\n\nIn its judgment of 12 November 2013, the Cassation Court referred to the CPA, as follows (with footnotes here omitted):105\n\n*\"\u2026 When collusion is an independent action governed by our Ecuadorian legislation, it is so regulated under the Collusion Prosecution Act; and, as stated by this Division of the Court, it is not possible to seek the cassation of a judgment by making these kinds of allegations \u2026 Therefore, the affirmation made by the court of appeals is the correct one, as it is not within its scope of that court to have jurisdiction to hear collusive action cases within a summary verbal proceeding, or procedural fraud, judges' behaviors, proper and improper meetings, the appointment of substitute judges, plaintiffs' connivance, among other allegations made by the appellant company \u2026\"*\n\nC-1975, p. 95. (The CPA had not been cited in the Lago Agrio Appellate Court's Judgment).\n\n7.138.\n\nThe Tribunal found this passage, at first, difficult to follow. To the Tribunal's understanding, the Cassation Court was here deciding that cases of collusion under the CPA are reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of judges vested with jurisdiction under the CPA in respect of the matters described in this passage. Accordingly, in respect of such matters, these CPA judges have exclusive jurisdiction as a first instance court, although eventually their decisions may be subject to successive appeals within the Ecuadorian judicial system.\n\n7.139.\n\nThis difficulty was resolved by the Judgment of the Constitutional Court. The Court there unequivocally confirmed that the Cassation Court was correct in deciding that it lacked any jurisdiction to address or redress \"the arguments expounded by Chevron\" (as also the Constitutional Court), with Chevron's only remedy avaible before CPA judges under the CPA: see the extracts from Chapter 2 of its Judgment in Part V above.\n\n7.140.\n\nIn his sixth expert report of 7 May 2014 (with footnotes here omitted), Dr Coronel testified as to 'how an action under the CPA operates':106\n\n*\"32. The action for collusion must be filed before a civil judge. That judgment issued by the trial court judge may be appealed before the respective Provincial Court, and the appellate court judgment may be appealed by cassation before the National Court of Justice. Finally, even after the decision of the National Court of Justice is rendered, it could be possible to file an extraordinary action for protection before the Constitutional Court.*\n\n*33. Chevron has asked me to explain whether or not interim measures may be granted within a collusion action. Specifically, Chevron has asked me to explain if a plaintiff in an action for collusion, brought [regarding] a trial in which there has allegedly been procedural fraud, whose judgment is in the process of being enforced within and without Ecuador, could obtain any interim measure suspending the enforcement of this judgment. In my opinion, the answer is no.*\n\n*34. First, none of the applicable rules on preventive measures grants a judge the power to order the suspension of a judgment that has been declared to be enforceable by another court. There are no specific norms regarding interim measures in the Collusion Act, but the same law states that the Code of Civil Procedure applies in a subsidiary manner where there are no other express provisions in the law.*\n\n*35. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, there are only four types of preventive measures that a party can seek in any state of a lawsuit: (i) the sequestration of a thing, (ii) the withholding of funds, credits, or assets, (iii) the prohibition to sell real property, and the (iv) prohibition from leaving the country. The types of interim measures are thus circumscribed by law; indeed, recognizing the limited nature of the powers of Ecuadorian judges regarding interim measures, several bills have suggested that such powers be broadened, but they have not passed. None of these four possible preventive measures are a mechanism to suspend the enforcement of a decision.*\n\n*36. Second, under the hypothetical presented, there would not be any interim measures available because none of the requisites established by law would be in place for them to be ordered. Three of these measures (the attachment, seizure, and prohibition from leaving the country) require the existence of a credit in favor of the petitioner to be granted. A credit is a personal right which may be demanded by creditor to debtor, who must give something or do or refrain from doing something. A debt or a judgment are credits, but a right of action or a pending lawsuit are not credits. In this hypothetical case, there would be no credit in favor of petitioner. In the case of the restraining order against selling, to obtain it, the existence of a credit must be evidenced or it must be proven that a lawsuit concerning specific property is taking place and that the restraining order against selling concerns that property. In the hypothetical case presented to me, those conditions or requirements were not present.*\n\n*37. Finally, [judicial] practice confirms what I have stated. I am unaware of any case or precedent in which the Ecuadorian courts have issued an order of this nature.\"*\n\nCoronel ER 6, paras 32-37.\n\n7.141.\n\nIn brief, Chevron contends that collateral (or parallel) proceedings under the CPA would have been \"a wild goose chase\".107 Such proceedings would have involved a personal claim against Judge Zambrano and like claims against other alleged miscreants, in separate independent proceedings.108 Such proceedings would not have suspended the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, within or, particularly, without Ecuador in an effective and timely manner.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,144.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,155-156.\n\n7.142.\n\nIn brief, the Respondent contends that proceedings under the CPA were an available local remedy (until time-barred) that would have permitted Chevron to address and, if supported by persuasive evidence, obtain effective redress for its claims for 'fraud' in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.109 The Respondent also submits that Chevron's chances of success under the CPA were not \"tiny\".110\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,200-201.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,212.\n\n7.143.\n\nIn its Track II Rejoinder, the Respondent acknowledged that a judgment from the CPA would take about 18 months, followed by successive appeals within the Ecuadorian legal system.111 At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent acknowledged that, on average, CPA proceedings take 17 months, with the CPA judgment only becoming enforceable later by order of the first instance Appellate Court.112\n\nR-TII Mar. 2015, para 80.\n\nTrack II Hearing D13.2981.\n\n7.144.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Dr Coronel's expert testimony that there was no possibility of interim measures under the CPA protecting Chevron's position during the pendency of any CPA proceedings and any subsequent appeals.\n\n7.145.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that any proceedings under the CPA, at the material time, could reasonably have been expected to result in any sufficient remedy for Chevron. It would have necessarily comprised one or more separate, collateral proceedings; but, above all, the timing of any CPA proceedings made them ineffective as a remedy for Chevron against the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Moreover, collusive action cases may be appropriate where it is alleged that there is collusion between parties, witnesses or legal representatives; but where the complaint raises procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and corruption within the Court itself, the State cannot leave remedial action to the efforts of private litigants \u2013 the State has its own responsibility to act by its several investigatory, prosecutorial and judicial agencies.\n\n7.146.\n\nAs regards timing, it was essential that the risk of enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, which could have been disastrous for Chevron (as envisaged in the Invictus Memorandum), be removed whilst the serious allegations of gross procedural and judicial improprieties in the Lago Agrio Court were addressed within the Ecuadorian legal system. That was not possible, given the fact that the Lago Agrio Judgment became enforceable under Ecuadorian law and, thus, enforceable outwith Ecuador on 1 March 2012 (see above).113 There was, therefore, insufficient time to complete any CPA proceedings (including one or more appeals) before the Lago Agrio Judgment became enforceable, with enforcement proceedings beginning shortly thereafter on 30 May 2012.\n\nTrack II Hearing D13.2963.\n\n7.147.\n\nThere is therefore no reason to assume, assessed objectively at the time, that any collateral (or parallel) relief under the CPA could have protected Chevron from the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in a sufficiently timely, effective and adequate manner. The Tribunal also notes the statement, in *Pantechniki*, that it may not be necessary for a claimant to resort to \"oblique or indirect applications to parallel jurisdictions\".114\n\n*Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers (Greece) v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, para 96, RLA-17.\n\n7.148.\n\nIn the circumstances prevailing at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to require Chevron to have begun collateral proceedings under the CPA in an attempt to suspend the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate Judgment.\n\n7.149.\n\n*(iii) The Constitutional Court:* On 23 December 2013, Chevron submitted to the Constitutional Court its \"extraordinary action for protection\" impugning, on constitutional grounds, the Lago Agrio Judgment. As at the Track II Hearing, Chevron's application remained pending before the Constitutional Court.115 At that time, there was no information available to the Claimants as to when the Constitutional Court was likely to arrive at any decision.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,198, D12.2771.\n\n7.150.\n\nSubsequently, there was a procedural hearing on 16 July 2015 before the Constitutional Court; on 2 October 2015, the Constitutional Court's Secretary-General advised the Parties that the Court had received the Presiding Judge's draft ruling; on 25 July 2017, the Court advised the Parties that it would require a further hearing, at a date to be fixed; but no hearing date had been fixed as at April 2018.116 According to the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, the Constitutional Court's judgment \"ought to be forthcoming in the coming months or year\".\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the Claimants' letter dated 19 March 2018, p. 2.\n\n7.151.\n\nAs already indicated in Part V above, the Constitutional Court held a public hearing on 22 May 2018; and it issued its Judgment on 27 June 2018.117\n\nC-2551.\n\n7.152.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Chevron's action before the Constitutional Court did not offer to Chevron any timely and effective remedy for the Lago Agrio Judgment within the Ecuadorian legal system. As already indicated, the Lago Agrio Judgment became enforceable on 1 March 2012; foreign enforcement proceedings were commenced on 30 May 2012; and the Lago Agrio Judgment's execution was ordered against Chevron and TexPet in Ecuador on 3 August and 15 October 2012. The Constitutional Court's Judgment was issued more than 4\u00bd years after Chevron commenced its action before the Court; and its action was dismissed by the Court. The Tribunal also notes the statement in *Jan de Nul v Egypt* (supra) that \"it would make no sense to insist upon the exhaustion of remedies that are unavailable precisely because the issuance of an appealable decision is delayed\".118\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008 *,* para 256, CLA-230.\n\n7.153.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to require Chevron to have awaited the result of its action before the Constitutional Court before pursuing its claims in this arbitration under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including its protection against denial of justice. In any event, given its action's dismissal, Chevron has exhausted its remedies within the Ecuadorian judicial system comprising the Lago Agrio Appelate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts.\n\n7.154.\n\n*(7) The Tribunal's Conclusion as to Judicial Finality:* The Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objections, both as to jurisdiction and admissibility, based on Chevron's failure to exhaust local remedies or to satisfy the requirement of judicial finality for its claims for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n7.155.\n\n*(8) Amendment of the Claims:* The Tribunal turns to the third part of the jurisdictional objection to the Claimants' claims for denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, as here also raised by the Tribunal upon its own initiative. Further, although not expressly pleaded by the Respondent as a jurisdictional objection, possibly because the Respondent also amended its defence during the course of these proceedings (albeit with no objection by the Claimants), the Tribunal considers it appropriate to treat the Respondent's jurisdictional objections as implicitly including this third part.\n\n7.156.\n\nThe Claimants' claims for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, based on the alleged 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment, were not pleaded in their original Notice of Arbitration submitted under Article 2 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Nor could they be. The Claimant's Notice was submitted on 23 September 2009. The Lago Agrio Judgment was subsequently issued on 14 February 2011 and declared to be enforceable on 1 March 2012 by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court. Within five weeks, on 20 March 2012, the Claimants introduced Chevron's claims for denial of justice in this arbitration by their Supplemental Memorial on the Merits, as thereafter supplemented in writing and orally up to and including the Track II Hearing.119\n\nC-Mer. Mar. 2012, para 257(4), re-pleaded in C-TII June 2013, and C-TII May 2014, at paras 424(5) and 199(A)(1) respectively.\n\n7.157.\n\nA similar timing analysis applies, mutatis mutandis, to the Claimants' claims under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty regarding the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That alleged breach of the Treaty took place not before the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011 and crystallised on 1 March 2012 with the order of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment enforceable.\n\n7.158.\n\nThe question arises whether these new claims can be maintained by the Claimants as an amendment to their pleadings under (i) Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; (ii) the Treaty; and (iii) Dutch law as *the lex loci arbitri*. The Claimants submit they can. As already explained above, even without the Respondent's express jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal has a duty to check its jurisdiction upon its own initiative, as it sought to do with the Parties at the Track II Hearing.120\n\nSee Track II Hearing D1,170-171, D9.2124 and D12.2640.\n\n7.159.\n\n*(i) The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:* Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n*\"During the course of the arbitral proceedings, either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances. However, a claim may not be amended in such a manner that it falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause or separate arbitration agreement.\"*\n\n7.160.\n\nArticle 20 entitles a claimant to amend its claim without the prior permission of the arbitral tribunal. The word \"claim\" in Article 20 signifies the claimant's statement of claim, as does \"defence\" the respondent's statement of defence (or counterclaim), whether in their original form or as supplemented under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The amendment is not limited to a specific claim or specific defence already pleaded by a party.121 In principle, therefore, a claimant has the right to amend its pleaded case at any time (subject to the tribunal's procedural orders otherwise), including matters occurring after the notice of arbitration. Having done so, the tribunal has a discretionary power to disallow such an amendment by virtue of any of the three factors listed in Article 20; namely (i) delay; (ii) prejudice; and (iii) other circumstances.\n\nJ. van Hof *, Commentary on the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: The Application by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal* (1991), p. 135; S.

Webster, *Handbook of UNCITRAL Arbitration: Commentary, Precedents and Materials for UNCITRAL Based Arbitration Rules* (2010), pp. 322ff.\n\n7.161.\n\nAs regards the fourth factor (where the tribunal has no discretion), jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that it requires that the amended claim should \"not fall outside the tribunal's jurisdiction under the arbitration clause or agreement\".122 Thus, the jurisdictional difficulty that can arise in an ad hoc arbitration, resulting from the difference between the scope of the arbitration clause and the scope of the reference under that clause, does not arise in an UNCITRAL arbitration with Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.123\n\nS. Baker & M. Davis, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in Practice: The Experience of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal* (1992), p. 93, CLA-34, RLA-447; D. Caron & L. Kaplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary*, 2nd ed. (2013), p. 468.\n\nThis old common law rule, as regards English law, is addressed in M. Mustill & S. Boyd, *Commercial Arbitration* (1982), pp. 93ff.\n\n7.162.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is no difficulty arising from the interpretation of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Any difficulty arises from its application to the present case.\n\n7.163.\n\nThe application of Article 20 was considered by the UNCITRAL tribunal in *European American Bank v Slovakia* (2014). The respondent had there amended its statement of defence to add a late jurisdictional objection. The tribunal decided (with footnotes here omitted):124\n\n*\"115. The Tribunal considers that what is now explicit in Article 23(2) of the 2010 Rules was implicit in [Article 20 of] the 1976 Rules. To preclude a respondent from making a jurisdictional objection after it submitted its statement of defence when that objection concerned facts which arose only after the date on which that statement was filed would involve a grave injustice. That injustice would be particularly grave where, as here, the new facts involve conduct on the part of the Claimant which the Claimant chose not to notify to the Respondent or the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that the leading commentary on the UNCITRAL Rules [citing D. Caron & L. Kaplan] points out that the Conference which adopted the 1976 Rules considered that the inclusion of a provision in what became Article 21(3) of the 1976 Rules expressly permitting a tribunal to allow a late jurisdictional plea was unnecessary, because the provision on amendment in Article 20 and the broad general power of the tribunal 'to conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate' were sufficient. The commentary concludes: 'The last sentence of Article 23(2) [of the 2010 Rules] thus expressly states what was previously only implicit under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules: that the arbitral tribunal has discretion in limited circumstances to admit justifiably late pleas, such as due to the discovery of new evidence.'*\n\n*116. In consequence, the Tribunal finds that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules do not bar a party from raising a jurisdictional objection based upon facts which came into existence, or which it could have discovered by reasonable inquiry, only after the filing of a statement of defence.\"*\n\n*European American Bank v Slovakia*, PCA Case No 2010-17, Second Award on Jurisdiction of 4 June 2014, paras 115-116.\n\n7.164.\n\nIt would be possible here to cite at length similar decisions on the application of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules made by other UNCITRAL tribunals. It is unnecessary to do so: the legal materials on the interpretation and application of Article 20 amount to a liberal or pragmatic 'jurisprudence constante' already evident from its own terms.\n\n7.165.\n\nAs to the first factor of \"delay\", the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants were guilty of any material delay. They amended their case as promptly as they reasonably could on 20 March 2012, following the Lago Agrio Appellate Court's order declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment enforceable on 1 March 2012.\n\n7.166.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants had earlier pleaded in their Notice of Arbitration of 23 September 2009 other claims advanced under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.125 The Notice of Arbitration pleaded a \"judicial farce\" in the Lago Agrio Litigation.126 Its allegations related to (inter alia) the Cabrera Report and other misconduct by the Lago Agrio Court, amounting to serious allegations of gross procedural and judicial improprieties.127 It raised complaints regarding the 1995 Settlement Agreement.128 The amended claims of 20 March 2012 for denial of justice regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment were made under the same FET standard, materially similar to the Claimants' claims pleaded in 2009 (as supplemented by their subsequent pleadings prior to March 2012).\n\nC-NoA Sept. 2009, paras 69 & 76(2).\n\nC-NoA Sept. 2009, para 44.\n\nC-NoA Sept. 2009, paras 47-54.\n\nC-NoA Sept. 2009, para 3, 4, 14-21, 32-35 & 68ff.\n\n7.167.\n\nAs to the second factor, \"prejudice\", the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent has suffered any material prejudice from the Claimants' amended claims. In particular, the Respondent has been afforded a full opportunity in Track II to address the Claimants' amended claims and to present its own case, as required by Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, including the Track II Hearing.\n\n7.168.\n\nAs to the third factor, \"any other circumstances\", the Tribunal considers that no such circumstance exists for the Tribunal to disallow the Claimants' amended claims. In particular, this is not a case where a new disputing party has sought to join as a coclaimant, or where an existing party advances an entirely new claim wholly unrelated to the parties' existing dispute. The Claimants' amended claims in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment (as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court) were made by existing claimants advancing claims under the same FET standard in Article II(3)(a) and the same Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. These amended claims arose from the same evolving dispute between the same disputing parties that had led directly to the issuance and enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in the same Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n7.169.\n\nMoreover, from the time when this Tribunal was appointed in 2010, it was evident that the Lago Agrio Judgment was a likely imminent event, with the potential to inflict grave harm not only to the Claimants (particularly Chevron) but also, paradoxically, to the Respondent also. That is why, so as to maintain the *status quo* and to avoid the aggravation of the Parties' dispute, the Tribunal made its several orders and awards for interim measures intended temporarily to preclude the Lago Agrio Judgment's issuance and enforcement by the Respondent's judicial branch. The Claimants' amended claims following the Lago Agrio Judgment did not therefore fall unexpectedly from a clear blue sky in this arbitration. These amended claims were a foreseeable evolution of the Parties' existing dispute; and they did not transform the Claimants' case against the Respondent in this arbitration into an entirely new and different dispute.\n\n7.170.\n\nFurther, in all the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it would be an unreasonable, if not absurd, result for the Claimants to advance their amended claims as new claims in a new arbitration before a new arbitral tribunal, at unnecessarily greater expense and delay, with the risk of inconsistent decisions. It could serve no useful purpose to any of the Parties. If the Claimants had sought to do so, the Respondent would have had every right to object to such an abuse of process. There is an overall balancing exercise to be performed by the Tribunal in the exercise of its discretion as a matter of common sense, under this third factor in Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.171.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes the award in *Encana v Ecuador* (2006),129 where the UNCITRAL tribunal decided:\n\n*\"\u2026 a balance must be struck between, on the one hand, unreasonably requiring that new proceedings be commenced where the substance of a claim of breach of the BIT [the Ecuador-Canada BIT] may arguably have been made out or very nearly made out, and subsequent events put the question of breach beyond doubt, and, on the other, allowing what are in essence new claims or new causes of action which in reality have no real relation to the events initially relied upon, to be added onto existing proceedings on the basis of events subsequent to the commencement of proceedings.\"*\n\nIn this arbitration, as a matter of reasonableness and common sense, the Tribunal strikes that balance towards the first and not the second of these two alternatives.\n\n*EnCana Corporation. v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3481, Award, 3 February 2006, para 164, RLA-41. The tribunal there referred the ICJ's decision in *Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia)*, ICJ, Judgment, 26 June 1992, 1992 ICJ Reports 240, paras 62-70, declaring claims not included in the original application inadmissible insofar as they constituted \"both in form and in substance, a new claim, and the subject of the dispute originally submitted to the Court would be transformed if it entertained that claim\" (para 70). See also *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL (Ad hoc), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006, para 101, CLA-631.\n\n7.172.\n\nAs to the fourth factor in Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has decided above in favour of its jurisdiction (with admissibility) to decide the Claimants' claims. Thus, in relation to the Lago Agrio Judgment, Article 20 does not require the Tribunal to disallow the Claimants' amended claims for want of jurisdiction under the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n7.173.\n\n*(ii) The Treaty:* As to the Treaty, the Parties' Arbitration Agreement expressly incorporates the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Thus, by consent from the outset of these arbitration proceedings, the right of any Party to amend its pleaded case (whether it be as claimant or respondent) was governed by Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as a self-contained procedural code. Provided the amendment meets the requirements of Article 20 (including jurisdiction and admissibility), the Tribunal considers that nothing in the Treaty precludes such an amendment, even in regard to an event occurring after the arbitration's commencement. Thus, the Tribunal sees no cause under the Treaty barring the Claimants' amended claims under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n7.174.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the position under international law generally, in the absence of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.175.\n\nIn *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France)*, the International Court of Justice observed:130\n\n*\"When the Court has examined its jurisdiction over facts or events subsequent to the filing of the application, it has emphasized the need to determine whether those facts or events were connected to the facts or events already falling within the Court's jurisdiction and whether consideration of those later facts or events would transform the 'nature of the dispute' \u2026.\"*\n\n*Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France),* ICJ, Judgment, 4 June 2008, 2008 ICJ Reports 177, para 87.\n\n7.176.\n\nThe International Court of Justice has considered claims based on facts that occurred after the filing of the Application on multiple occasions. For example, in *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Germany v. Iceland)*, Germany raised claims based on acts that postdated its Application. The Court had no difficulty in deciding that it had jurisdiction over these claims, explaining:131\n\n*\"The Court cannot accept the view that it would lack jurisdiction to deal with this submission. The matter raised therein is part of the controversy between the Parties, and constitutes a dispute relating to Iceland's extension of its fisheries jurisdiction. The submission is one based on facts subsequent to the filing of the Application, but arising directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of that Application. As such it falls within the scope of the Court's jurisdiction defined in the compromissory clause of the Exchange of Notes of 19 July 1961.\"*\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction (Germany v. Iceland*), ICJ, Judgment (Merits), 25 July 1974, 1974 ICJ Reports 175, para 72.\n\n7.177.\n\nSimilarly, in *LaGrand (Germany v. United States*), Germany made a submission based entirely on facts that occurred after the filing of its Application. The Court held that it had jurisdiction over this submission:132\n\n*\"The third submission of Germany concerns issues that arise directly out of the dispute between the Parties before the Court over which the Court has already held that it has jurisdiction (see paragraph 42 above), and which are thus covered by Article 1 of the Optional Protocol. The Court reaffirms, in this connection, what it said in its Judgment in the Fisheries Jurisdiction case, where it declared that in order to consider the dispute in al1 its aspects it may also deal with a submission that 'is one based on facts subsequent to the filing of the Application, but arising directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of that Application. As such it falls within the scope of the Court's jurisdiction \u2026' (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 203, para. 72).\"*\n\n*LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America)*, ICJ, Judgment, 27 June 2001, 2001 ICJ Reports 466, para 45, CLA-46.\n\n7.178.\n\nBefore the International Court of Justice, the appropriate test for determining the existence of jurisdiction over facts occurring after the filing of an Application is whether those facts \"aris[e] directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of [the] Application\". In the Tribunal's view, the Claimants' amended claims under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty clearly arise directly from the Parties' dispute pre-dating the Claimants' Notice of Arbitration. Accordingly, even without Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal sees no cause under international law barring the Claimants' amended claims under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n7.179.\n\n*(iii) Dutch Law:* As to Dutch law, the Tribunal has been shown no mandatory or other rule of Dutch law that could preclude the Claimants' amended claims. At the Track II Hearing, the Claimants' Counsel, relaying advice from their Dutch Counsel, stated that there was no such mandatory rule.133 The Respondent did not then suggest otherwise.\n\nTrack II Hearing D12.2652.\n\n7.180.\n\n(*9) The Tribunal's Conclusion as to the Amended Claims* : The Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to decide the Claimants' amended claims under the Parties' Arbitration Agreement.\n\n***F: The Tribunal's Final Conclusions***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n7.181.\n\nFor these several reasons, the Tribunal decides the first of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, as to a relevant \"investment\" under to the Treaty, in favour of Chevron and (confirming its earlier decisions) TexPet. As to the requirement of judicial finality the Tribunal decides the second of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in favour of Chevron and (if and to the extent relevant) TexPet. As regards the third part (also raised by the Tribunal upon its own initiative), the Tribunal decides to leave the Claimants' amended claims regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment (with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation Courts) as pleaded and not to disallow that pleading under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.182.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to and confirms its jurisdiction over the claims and amended claims pleaded by Chevron and TexPet under the FET standard (including its protection against denial of justice) and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and also under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. Further, the Tribunal decides that these claims are all admissible in this arbitration, and it rejects the Respondent's objections to the contrary effect under Articles VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n***PART VIII*** - ***THE MERITS OF****THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS****AND THE RESPONDENT'S DEFENCES***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n8.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the merits of the Claimants' claims and the Respondent's defences under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n8.2.\n\nIt is again necessary to address and decide separately the issues under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty as regards denial of justice, and the issues under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty as regards the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n8.3.\n\nFor both sets of issues, the Tribunal has again kept in mind that each of the Parties bears the legal burden of proving its positive allegations under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.1\n\nArticle 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides: \"Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\".\n\n***B: The Tribunal's Analysis & Conclusion on the 1995 Settlement Agreement***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.4.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's earlier decisions in Track I and 1B of these arbitration proceedings, which also record the Parties' principal submissions on the 1995 Settlement Agreement, it is possible to address this part of the case succinctly.\n\n8.5.\n\nIn its First Partial Award, the Tribunal decided that Chevron and TexPet were both \"Releasees\" under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release. The Tribunal also decided that Chevron and TexPet could invoke their contractual rights as \"Releasees\" against the Respondent in regard to \"diffuse\" claims (as there described).2\n\nFirst Partial Award, para 112. (For ease of reference, as already indicated earlier in this Award, the Tribunal has referred to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1996 Release and the 1998 Final Release collectively as \"the 1995 Settlement Agreement\").\n\n8.6.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, such contractual rights correspond to an 'obligation' by the Respondent towards each of Chevron and TexPet within the meaning of the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n8.7.\n\nIn Parts IV and V of this Award, the Tribunal has found that the Lago Agrio Judgment, with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts, rests upon finding Chevron liable for diffuse claims in noncompliance with the Respondent's obligations to release Chevron (with TexPet and Texaco) from such liability under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.\n\n8.8.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, by the acts of its judicial branch, attributable to the Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Respondent violated its obligations under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, thereby committing international wrongs towards each of Chevron and TexPet.\n\n8.9.\n\nChevron's injury from such international wrong here requires no explanation: it was the sole named defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the sole named judgment debtor under the Lago Agrio Judgment. Issues as to reparation for such injury in the form of compensation claimed by Chevron are currently assigned to Track III of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n8.10.\n\nAs already indicated in Part VII above, TexPet is in a different position from Chevron for any injury resulting from the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment (as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Court Judgments). TexPet was not a named defendant to the Lago Agrio Litigation; nor was it so identified in the Lago Agrio Judgment. However, as described in Parts IV and V of this Award, the Lago Agrio Judgment held TexPet publicly responsible for extensive environmental damage in the former concession area between 1964 and 1992; and, by its order of 15 October 2012, the Lago Agrio Court ordered the execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment against (*inter alios*) TexPet by name and attached TexPet's remaining assets in Ecuador. As with Chevron, issues as to reparation for any injury in the form of compensation claimed by TexPet are currently assigned to Track III of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n8.11.\n\nIn conclusion, under the Umbrella Clause in Article III(3)(c) of the Treaty, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent is liable to make reparation to each of Chevron and TexPet, as addressed in Parts IX and X below ***.***\n\n***C: The Parties' Cases as to Denial of Justice***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n8.12.\n\nThe Parties' respective factual and expert cases have been addressed at length in Parts IV, V and VI above, on which the Tribunal has made its findings. It would therefore serve no purpose to recite these cases in full here, save for the following summaries for ease of reference.\n\n8.13.\n\n*(1) The Claimants' Case:* In brief,3 as regards denial of justice, the Claimants at the Track II Hearing summarised the defects in the Lago Agrio Litigation as \"five types of poison: judicial fraud and corruption, gross violations of due process, executive interference, judgments which are a mockery of legal reasoning, [and] factual findings which are taken out of thin air.\"4\n\nSee generally C-Mer. Mar. 2012, Sections III & IV; C-TII Jan. 2015, Sections III-XI.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1.20 & 141.\n\n8.14.\n\nThe first and second of these complaints refer to the alleged 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment, together with judicial misconduct and procedural fraud. The third refers to alleged interference with the Lago Agrio Litigation by the Respondent's executive branch. The fourth and fifth relate to the \"absurd\" reasons and \"junk science\" in the Lago Agrio Judgment (as affirmed by the subsequent judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts). For reasons already indicated in Part VII(C)(2) above, as regards their merits, the Tribunal does not consider these fourth and fifth complaints in this Award any further.\n\n8.15.\n\nAs to the Claimants' specific allegations in regard to these first three matters, the Tribunal refers to the description and headings in its Conclusions set out at the end of Part V above. Using these headings, this part of the Claimants' case can be summarised as follows, as decided by the Tribunal.\n\n8.16.\n\nAs to the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Claimants contend that Judge Zambrano agreed to receive a bribe of US$ 500,000 from the Lago Agrio Judgment's proceeds in return for allowing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives corruptly to 'ghostwrite' the Lago Agrio Judgment; that Judge Zambrano did not write the Lago Agrio Judgment (as he otherwise testified in the RICO Litigation, falsely); and that the 'Cabrera fraud' taints the Lago Agrio Judgment. These allegations, as to the merits, are considered below.\n\n8.17.\n\nAs to their other allegations; the Claimants plead:\n\n(i) the misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez, as the presiding judge in the Lago Agrio Litigation (from February 2006 to October 2007), in regard to his order terminating the judicial inspections, his appointment of Mr Cabrera and private meetings with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives - as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V;\n\n(ii) the misconduct of Mr Cabrera, as an auxiliary officer of the Lago Agrio Court (from June 2007 to April 2008) - as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V;\n\n(iii) Judge Zambrano's improper connivance at Dr Guerra's 'ghostwriting' of seven of his court orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation (between October 2009 and March 2010) - as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V;\n\n(iv) the Veiga-P\u00e9rez Criminal Prosecutions by the Respondent (intermittently, from 2003 to 2011) - as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V;\n\n(v) the conduct of the Respondent's Government towards the Lago Agrio Litigation (from 2003 onwards) - as a distinct matter specifically in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment itself, this alleged denial of justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V. As a broader matter in regard to the Lago Agrio Litigation more generally, the Tribunal returns to this allegation below;\n\n(vi) the unwillingness or inability of the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities to conduct and complete criminal investigations in any significant manner into the prima facie evidence of procedural fraud, judicial misconduct in the Lago Agrio Litigation and of the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Court's Judgment, available to them from Chevron's allegations at the time of the Lago Agrio Judgment's enforceability on 1 March 2012: this allegation forms part of the overall denial of justice alleged by the Claimants and, as regards the merits, it is addressed further below; and\n\n(vii) the Judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court (2012), Cassation Court (2013) and Constitutional Court (2018) in leaving materially unremedied the Lago Agrio Judgment, notwithstanding the evidence of procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and 'ghostwriting' available to them from Chevron's allegations at the time, namely (as regards the Appellate Court) by the date of its order declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment's enforceability on 1 March 2012 and (as regards the Cassation and Constitutional Courts) by the date of their respective judgments on 12 November 2013 and 27 June 2018: these allegations form part of the overall denial of justice alleged by the Claimants and, as regards the merits, these are further addressed below.\n\n8.18.\n\nIt follows from this summary that the relevant allegations for the merits of the Claimants' claims for denial of justice comprise: (a) the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment; (b) the conduct of the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities; (c) the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation Courts in regard to alleged judicial misconduct, procedural fraud and 'ghostwriting' and (d) the conduct of the Respondent's Government in regard to the Lago Agrio Litigation generally.\n\n8.19.\n\n*(2) The Respondent's Case:* In brief,5 the Respondent denies that there has been any denial of justice or any other violation of Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and it refutes the Claimants' claims, as to both the facts and the applicable law.\n\nSee generally R-TII Nov. 2014, Sections II-V; R-TII Mar. 2015, Sections IV-VII.\n\n8.20.\n\nAs to the facts, the Respondent submits that the Lago Agrio Judgment was not 'ghostwritten\"; and that there is no cogent evidence to support the Claimants' allegations otherwise (as to which the Claimants bear the legal burden of proof). In particular, so the Respondent submits, Dr Guerra's testimony in support of the Claimants' case is inconsistent, unreliable and worthless; the contemporary evidence does not support any corrupt 'ghostwriting'; the forensic expert evidence proves that the Lago Agrio Judgment was not written by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives; the Claimants' case on the \"Unfiled Materials\" rests upon demonstrably false assumptions; Dr Zambrano's testimony in the RICO Litigation does not support the Claimants' allegations; Mr Cabrera was properly appointed as a court expert by the Lago Agrio Court; the Cabrera Report does not taint the Lago Agrio Judgment; and the conduct of the Respondent's Government towards the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs was not improper.\n\n8.21.\n\nAs to international law as the applicable law, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to establish that Judge Zambrano's alleged misconduct should be attributed to the Respondent; that the Claimants' case regarding the Lago Agrio Litigation and Lago Agrio Judgment does not meet the requirements for a breach by the Respondent of its obligations under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; that the decisions in the Lago Agrio Judgment were made reasonably; that the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities have been and still are investigating, in confidence, aspects of the Lago Agrio Litigation; and that there is nothing materially amiss in the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation or Constitutional Court Judgments.\n\n***D: The Tribunal's Analysis as to Denial of Justice***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.22.\n\n*(1) Introduction* : As to the relevant factual and expert evidence, as indicated above, the Tribunal has already addressed at length and decided the Parties' respective cases in Parts IV, V and VI above. For the reasons there set out, the Tribunal has not accepted the Respondent's submissions on the evidence adduced in this arbitration. It remains unnecessary here to re-state the Tribunal's conclusions. Nonetheless, as regards the merits, the Tribunal addresses below the Claimants' four complaints listed under sub-paragraphs 8.18(a) to (d) above.\n\n8.23.\n\n*(2) The Legal Test for Denial of Justice under the Treaty:* The Tribunal begins with the legal test for denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n8.24.\n\nThere is a consistent line of awards over many years, amounting to a *jurisprudence constante*, deciding that a denial of justice in violation of customary international law will also amount to a breach of an FET standard in a treaty: *Azinian* (1999), *Mondev* (2002), *Waste Management (No 2)* (2004), *International Thunderbird* (2006), *Jan de Nul* (2008), *Rumeli* (2008), *Pey Casado* (2008), *AMTO* (2008), *Al-Bahloul* (2010), *Liman Caspian* (2010), *Frontier* (2010), *Roussalis* (2011), *Oostergete* l (2012), *Swisslion* (2012), and *Flughafen Zurich* (2014).6 However, ordinarily, the protection for denial of justice under an FET standard in a treaty (such standard providing the international minimum standard for fair and equitable treatment of an alien) is neither broader nor narrower than protection for denial of justice under customary international law: *Iberdrola* (2012).7 Conversely, apart from denial of justice, an FET standard in a treaty (even limited to fair and equitable treatment under international customary law) provides a broader protection to a covered investor than does denial of justice under customary international law: *Vivendi* (2007).8\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen Baca v.

These impose upon the Claimants the same legal requirements to establish on the merits their case alleging a denial of justice. (For ease of reference below, the Tribunal continues to address denial of justice under the FET standard, although its analysis applies equally to denial of justice under customary international law.)\n\n8.26.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as to the merits, the legal test is whether any shock or surprise to an impartial tribunal occasioned by the Lago Agrio Judgment, with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts, leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as left materially uncorrected or unremedied within the Respondent's own legal system.\n\n8.27.\n\nBy the shorthand terms \"uncorrected\" and \"unremedied\", here and elsewhere in this Award, the Tribunal means that the Lago Agrio Judgment (excepting its award of punitive damages) was considered by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts, in full knowledge of the complaints of serious procedural impropriety, without appropriate steps being taken to address the allegations of procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and 'ghostwriting' raised by Chevron at the time.\n\n8.28.\n\nIn Part V above, the Tribunal has found that the Lago Agrio Court, the Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court did not investigate Chevron's allegations of procedural fraud and judicial misconduct; and the Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts also did not investigate the allegedly corrupt 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment. This was not done in ignorance of Chevron's specific allegations at the time. In the Tribunal's view, these Courts had sufficient information available to them so as to amount (at least) to a strong prima facie case of judicial misconduct, procedural fraud in the Lago Agrio Litigation and (as regards the Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n8.29.\n\nIn Chevron's Initial Alegato of 6 January 2011 addressed to the Lago Agrio Court, (extending over 263 pages of written submissions), Chevron contended (inter alia) that the Lago Agrio Litigation \"should be terminated, with the entire Complaint dismissed, because they have been permeated by fraud\"; that \"Chevron has been denied due process and its constitutional rights\"; and that \"systematic constitutional violations and substantial procedural defects render these proceedings a legal nullity.\" The alleged fraud included the judicial misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez; the improper appointment of Mr Cabrera; his corrupt collusion with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, the \"fraudulent and flawed\" Cabrera Report; and the violation of Chevron's rights including its status as a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.9\n\nC-1213.\n\n8.30.\n\nIn Chevron's Appeal to the Lago Agrio Appellate Court of 9 March 2011 (extending over 193 pages), Chevron contended (inter alia) that the Lago Agrio Judgment should be declared a nullity \"due to procedural fraud and violation of the guarantee of due process\". These allegations, set out at length, included the judicial misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez; the corrupt collusion with Mr Cabrera; the fraudulent Cabrera Report; the use of information in the Lago Agrio Judgment that was \"not in the record as the basis for the decision\"; and the violation of Chevron's rights under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.10\n\nC-1178.\n\n8.31.\n\nIn Chevron's Cassation Appeal of 20 January 2012 (extending over 176 pages), Chevron included amongst the grounds for its appeal: the judicial misconduct of Judge Y\u00e1nez; the \"illegal appointment and actions\" of Mr Cabrera; the \"irregularities\" in the Cabrera Report; the violation of Chevron's rights under the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' \"illicit participation in the drafting of\" the Lago Agrio Judgment.11\n\nC-1068.\n\n8.32.\n\nIn Chevron's action before the Constitutional Court, its submissions recorded in the Court's Judgment mirrored much of its case presented earlier at the RICO trial and in this arbitration.\n\n8.33.\n\nThere is little in this Award (or the RICO Judgment) that would add to the substance of the allegations made by Chevron to the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts in 2011, 2012 and 2018. In all material respects, at these times, there was before these three Courts at least strong prima facie evidence of judicial misconduct, procedural fraud and (particularly) 'ghostwriting', raising justifiable concerns as to the judicial propriety of the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment. The same situation prevailed as regards the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities, beginning at an earlier time.\n\n8.34.\n\nYet, as the Tribunal finds, no appropriate steps were taken by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court, the Constitutional Court or these prosecutorial authorities to address the allegations of procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and 'ghostwriting' raised by Chevron at the time, sufficient to suspend the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment and to comply with the Tribunal's several Orders and Awards on Interim Measures.\n\n8.35.\n\nAs to the doctrine of denial justice under international law, the Tribunal has been guided generally by four awards cited by the Parties: *Azinian v Mexico* (1999),12*Mondev v USA* (2002),13*Loewen v USA* (2003)14 and *Oostergetel v Slovakia* (2012).15\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen Baca v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, especially para 102, CLA-299.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, especially para 127, CLA-7.\n\n*Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Final Award, 26 June 2003, especially para 132, CLA-44.\n\n*Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL (Ad hoc), Final Award, 23 April 2012, especially para 273, RLA-307.\n\n8.36.\n\nIn *Oostergetel*, it was decided that the standard for denial of justice (as part of the FET standard) was \"a demanding one. To meet the applicable test, it will not be enough to claim that municipal law has been breached, that the decision of a national court is erroneous, that a judicial procedure was incompetently conducted, or that the actions of the judge in question were probably motivated by corruption. A denial of justice implies the failure of a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards.\"16\n\n*Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL (Ad hoc), Final Award, 23 April 2012, para 273, RLA-307.\n\n8.37.\n\nThe Tribunal has also borne in mind, as these legal materials confirm, that the doctrine of denial of justice essentially addresses procedural unfairness and not (by itself) an error of fact or applicable national law, although both may equally defeat the complainant's substantive rights. An international tribunal, such as this Tribunal, cannot act as a court of appeal. As a former ICJ judge once wrote: if all that a judge does is to make a mistake, i.e. to arrive at a wrong conclusion of law or fact, the State is not responsible. the only thing that can establish a denial of justice so far as a judgment is concerned is an affirmative answer, duly supported by evidence, to some such question as 'Was the court guilty of bias, fraud, dishonesty, lack of impartiality, or gross incompetence?'.. *. bona fide* error does not entail responsibility.\"17\n\nG.G. Fitzmaurice, \"The Meaning of the Term 'Denial of Justice'\" (1932) 13 British Yearbook of International Law 93, pp. 112-113, CLA-301.\n\n8.38.\n\nAs to the threshold required for denial of justice, the Tribunal adopts the approach taken by the NAFTA tribunal in *Mondev v USA* (2002), citing the judgment of the International Court of Justice in *ELSI* (1989), that the impugned judgment must be clearly improper and discreditable18 (with footnotes here omitted):19\n\n*\"127. In the ELSI case, a Chamber of the Court described as arbitrary conduct that which displays 'a wilful disregard of due process of law,... which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety'. It is true that the question there was whether certain administrative conduct was 'arbitrary', contrary to the provisions of an FCN treaty. Nonetheless (and without otherwise commenting on the soundness of the decision itself) the Tribunal regards the Chamber's criterion as useful also in the context of denial of justice, and it has been applied in that context, as the Claimant pointed out. The Tribunal would stress that the word 'surprises' does not occur in isolation. The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and on the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other treaties for the protection of investments) is intended to provide a real measure of protection. In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat open-ended standard, but it may be that in practice no more precise formula can be offered to cover the range of possibilities.\"*\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, ICJ, Judgment, 20 July 1989, 1989 ICJ Reports 15, para 128, CLA-237.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para 127, CLA-7.\n\n8.39.\n\nThe approach in this passage has been followed subsequently by other international tribunals, including *GEA v Ukraine* (2011), *Arif* (2013) and *Mamidoil* (2015).20\n\n*GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, para 312 (by agreement of the parties), CLA-300, RLA-648; *Franck Charles Arif v. Republic of Moldova*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 2013, para 445, RLA-651 and *Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe S.A. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/24, Award, 30 March 2015, paras 764-769.\n\n8.40.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasises that the legal test for denial of justice requires the claimant to prove objectively that the impugned judgment was \"clearly improper and discreditable\", with the failure by the \"national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards\". There have been many shocks and surprises caused by court judgments in legal history, but without much more, amounting to discreditable improprieties and the failure of the whole national system, such judgments do not amount to a denial of justice.\n\n8.41.\n\nA claimant's legal burden of proof is therefore not lightly discharged, given that a national legal system will benefit from the general evidential principle known by the Latin maxim as *omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium*. It presumes (subject to rebuttal) that the court or courts have acted properly. This general principle was described by Professor O'Connell as follows, as cited to the NAFTA tribunal in *Loewen* (with footnotes there and here omitted):21\n\n*\"When one comes to examine failure of the courts themselves 'palpable deviation' from the accepted standards of judicial practice are not so readily ascertained. For one thing, there is a presumption in favour of the judicial process. For another, defects in procedure may be of significance only internally, and not work an international injustice. For a third, wide discretion must be allowed a court in the reception and rejection of evidence, in adjournment, and in admission of documents, and it cannot be said that deviations even from the municipal law rules of evidence are deviations from an international standard. The first thing that must be ascertained is whether as a result of court manoeuvrings substantial injustice has been done to the claimant; the second is whether these manoeuvrings really amount to obstruction of the judicial process, and are extrinsic to the merits of his claim. Bad faith and not judicial error seems to be the heart of the matter, and bad faith may be indicated by an unreasonable departure from the rules of evidence and procedure.\"*\n\nSee D.P. O'Connell, *International Law*, 2nd ed. (1970), p. 948, RLA-150, cited in *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, First Opinion of Christopher Greenwood QC, 26 March 2001, p. 7, CLA-645.\n\n8.42.\n\nThis general principle subsumes a second principle, namely that a court is permitted a margin of appreciation before the threshold of a denial of justice can be met.22 Nonetheless, the balance of probabilities remains the standard of proof, with the claimant bearing the overall legal burden of proof.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL (Ad hoc), Partial Award, 13 November 2000, paras 261-262, CLA-462; see also *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3 and the First Opinion of Sir Robert Jennings QC, 26 October 1998, para 23 (on the \"Local Remedies Rule\", CLA-647.\n\n8.43.\n\n*(3) Attribution under International Law* : The Respondent contends that the conduct of Judge Zambrano in regard to the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment cannot be attributed to the Respondent because it was motivated by personal gain, with the Claimants in a better position than the Respondent to prevent such judicial misconduct.23\n\nR-TII Mar. 2015, paras 350ff.\n\n8.44.\n\nAs the Tribunal has found in Parts IV and V above, the 'ghostwriting' resulted from Judge Zambrano's initiative and the bribe promised to him by certain of the Lago Agrio representatives. It was not conduct directed by the Respondent; and Judge Zambrano's misconduct was not authorised under Ecuadorian law.\n\n8.45.\n\nThe Claimants submit that their claims for denial of justice address not the bribe agreed between Judge Zambrano and certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, but rather the Lago Agrio Judgment as \"the capstone of the judicial process: it bears the State's *imprimatur* of the proceedings that led to it.\"24 The Claimants cite from A.V. Freeman's work (1938, with references here omitted): fraud and corruption either during the proceedings or in connection with the rendering of judgment may produce a denial of justice. and the responsibility of the State cannot be evaded by relying upon any misapplied theory of the apparent powers of an agent.\".25\n\nC-TII Jan. 2015, para 285.\n\nA.V. Freeman, *The International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice* (1938), p. 268, fn 5, CLA-297.\n\n8.46.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued by Judge Zambrano in his capacity as a judge of the Lago Agrio Court, itself part of the Respondent's judicial branch; the Lago Agrio Judgment was accorded the status of a court judgment under Ecuadorian law; and it was (and remains) subject to enforcement and execution by the Respondent's judicial branch within the Respondent's national legal system.\n\n8.47.\n\nArticle 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states: \"The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.\"\n\n8.48.\n\nArticle 7 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states: \"The conduct of a State or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.\" The ILC Commentary to Article 7 emphasises the phrase \"in that capacity\", so as to distinguish the unauthorised conduct of persons acting in an official capacity from a case \"where the conduct is so removed from the scope of their official functions that it should be assimilated to that of private individuals, not attributable to the State.\"26 The latter case is not the present case.\n\nJ. Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (2002), p.108, RLA-549.\n\n8.49.\n\nIn *State Responsibility: The General Part* (2013), Professor Crawford addressed the dividing-line as regards attribution and non-attribution under ILC Article 7, by reference to two cases cited by the Parties in this arbitration, to different effect: *Caire* (1929)27 and *Yeager* (1987)28 (with footnotes here added):29\n\n*\"... The difference between the situation in Caire and the actions of the Revolutionary Guards in Yeager on the one hand [where there was attribution], and the Iran Air agent in Yeager on the other [where there was no attribution] is that the latter, although he was able to extract a bribe by virtue of his position, did not hold himself out as acting on behalf of the state. The soldiers in Caire were able to arrest their victim through the exercise of state authority; the Revolutionary Guards invoked their state power as customs officials. As was made clear in another case of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Petrolane Inc. v. Iran,30* *the Article 7 'extension' of liability for acts done ultra vires is predicated on the actions in question being done by 'persons cloaked with governmental authority'...\"*\n\n*Estate of Jean-Baptiste Caire (France) v.

Judge Zambrano was held out by the Respondent and also held himself out as a judge acting in the name of the Respondent.\n\n8.51.\n\nMoreover, the Lago Agrio Judgment was left unremedied by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court and (subject to the issue of punitive damages) the Cassation and Constitutional Courts, with sufficient knowledge of the Claimants' allegations regarding gross judicial improprieties in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the corrupt 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Their respective judgments are also to be attributed to the Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. It is not possible, therefore, to treat the misconduct of Judge Zambrano (as also other judges of the Lago Agrio Court) as private initiatives or personal frolics, unrelated to their judicial functions or otherwise unattributable to the Respondent under international law.\n\n8.52.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there can be no question as regards the attribution to the Respondent of an international wrong committed by the Lago Agrio Court (with the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts), as the judicial branch of the Respondent acting in such capacity in the Lago Agrio Litigation.\n\n8.53.\n\n*(4) The 'Ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment* : The facts established on the factual, expert and forensic evidence speak for themselves, as set out at length in Parts IV, V and VI above.\n\n8.54.\n\nAs there explained, the details as to how exactly all or material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment came to be written, corruptly by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives for Judge Zambrano, remain incomplete. The missing factual and forensic evidence is likely available only in Ecuador, if it still exists at all. Yet the circumstantial and other evidence adduced in this arbitration is overwhelming. Short of a signed confession by the miscreants, as rightly submitted by the Claimants at the end of the Track II Hearing, the evidence establishing 'ghostwriting' in this arbitration \"must be the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal.\"31\n\nTrack II Hearing D12.2756.\n\n8.55.\n\nAs found by the Tribunal in Parts IV and V above, two of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives who were privy to the 'ghostwriting' exercise were Mr Donziger and Mr Fajardo. As the Respondent acknowledged at the Track II Hearing, the participation of Mr Fajardo in 'ghostwriting' for Judge Zambrano, if correct (which the Respondent denies), would suffice to support the Claimants' claims for denial of justice.32 The Tribunal agrees: the Claimants' inability to identify by name with sufficient probability others of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, also involved in 'ghostwriting' (in addition to Mr Donziger), cannot by itself exculpate the Respondent from liability for denial of justice. If it were otherwise, the more successful the ghostwriting exercise, the less culpability would result. In any event, for denial of justice, the relevant actor is Judge Zambrano; and his participation in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment is firmly established on the evidence before this Tribunal.\n\nTrack II Hearing D1,243.\n\n8.56.\n\nOn such evidence, the Tribunal has found that Judge Zambrano acted corruptly, in return for a bribe promised to him by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives. Judge Zambrano's collusive conduct in the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment was not authorised under Ecuadorian law.33 Nor was it under judicial standards long established under international law. He was far from acting as an independent or impartial judge deciding the Lago Agrio Litigation fairly between the parties, under minimum standards for judicial conduct long recognized under international law.\n\nConstituci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador 2008 (2008 Ecuadorian Constitution), as amended on 13 July 2011, Registro Oficial 449 de 20 de octubre de 2008 (Ecuador), Article 76, RLA-164; C-400, Article 9; Vel\u00e1zquez ER, pp. 11-12; Track II Hearing D10.2346 & D11.2360.\n\n8.57.\n\nArticle 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948, provides: \"Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and any criminal charges against him\". Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 December 1966 (in force from 23 March 1976), to which the Respondent is a party, provides, in material part: \"All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\" Article 2 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, adopted by the UN General Assembly in November-December 1985, provides: \"The judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.\" Article 6 of these Basic Principles provides: \"The principle of the independence of the judiciary entitles and requires the judiciary to ensure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected.\"34\n\nUnited Nations, *Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary*, UN Doc. A/CONF.121/22/Rev.1 59 (1985), CLA-293; see the text of the UN Basic Principles set out in Part III(H) above.\n\n8.58.\n\nThe Tribunal does not understand from the Parties' respective submissions that these international standards for judicial conduct are materially disputed between them. Moreover, in addition to the Universal Declaration of 1948 and the International Covenant of 1966, the Constitutional Court's Judgment cites Article 8 of the American Convention on Human Rights of 1969 on the right to a fair trial \"by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal.\"35 As to Ecuadorian law, the Constitutional Court's Judgment also cites the constitutional rights under Articles 75 and 76(7)(k) of the Respondent's Constitution \"to the effective, impartial and speedy protection of his or her rights and interests\" and \"to be tried by an independent, impartial and competent judge.\"36\n\nC-2551, pp. 57-58.\n\nC-2551, pp. 65 and 57.\n\n8.59.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants' case on 'ghostwriting' satisfies the legal test for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, as at 1 March 2012 when the Lago Agrio Judgment became enforceable as a result of the Appellate Court's judgment and order. The evidence pointing to the corrupt conduct of Judge Zambrano in regard to the 'ghostwriting\" of the Lago Agrio Judgment in collusion with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives justifies the very gravest concerns as to judicial propriety in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment, with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts leaving the Lago Agrio Judgment materially unremedied. Judge Zambrano's conduct was grossly improper by any moral, professional and legal standards; and it directly impacted, adversely, the rights of Chevron (with TexPet).\n\n8.60.\n\nAccordingly, in the Tribunal's view, the Lago Agrio Judgment was, in the words of the award in *ELSI*, \"clearly improper and discreditable\" with the result that the Claimants' investments have \"been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment\". That judgment was left unremedied by the Respondent's own legal system, including the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts and the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities. That conduct amounted to a failure of the Respondent's national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards required under international law.\n\n8.61.\n\n*(5) Other Allegations:* The Tribunal does not base its decision, as secondarily alleged by the Claimants, on the institutional corruption of the Ecuadorian legal system as a whole, including the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts. In view of the Tribunal's decisions concerning the Lago Agrio Judgment, it is not an allegation material to the Claimants' primary case; and it is not here necessary for the Tribunal to address this secondary case, beyond the factors listed below.\n\n8.62.\n\nFirst, it was Texaco's decision to support the stay of the Aguinda Litigation in New York, thereby effectively remitting that litigation to the Ecuadorian legal system under Texaco's undertaking of 1999 to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in the Aguinda Litigation. According to the Respondent, following its subsequent merger with Texaco, Chevron became a party to Texaco's undertaking, as ostensibly confirmed the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment of 2011. It therefore lies with difficulty, so the Respondent contends, for Chevron and TexPet now to complain, in good faith, about an alleged state of affairs generally in the legal system of Ecuador, given that recourse to that system was the result of Texaco's and their own choosing. On the other hand, the Claimants deny the binding effect upon either of them of Texaco's undertaking, as also the legal effect of the Second Circuit's judgment under the laws of the USA; and the Claimants contend that the Lago Agrio Court wrongly assumed personal and subject-matter jurisdiction over Chevron.\n\n8.63.\n\nThe Tribunal prefers not to decide the issue whether or not Texaco's undertaking is binding upon Chevron. It is not necessary to do so for the purposes of this Award. Even if the Claimants were correct (which the Tribunal assumes, but does not decide), the Tribunal does not consider that the wrongful assertion of jurisdiction by the Lago Agrio Court over the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Complaint against Chevron can amount, by itself, to any breach of Article VI(1)(a) or Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty by the Respondent (acting by its judicial branch). The Tribunal notes, in particular, the terms of the Second Circuit's judgment (whatever its legal effect under the laws of the USA). Hence, the Tribunal discounts this first factor.\n\n8.64.\n\nSecond, even the general state of the Ecuadorian legal system (as alleged by the Claimants) is not uniformly applicable to all cases. As the Respondent rightly submits, the eventual dismissal of criminal charges against Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez as TexPet's signatories to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, albeit late, is inconsistent with the Ecuadorian judiciary dependent upon instructions from the Respondent's executive branch.\n\n8.65.\n\nThird, even with knowledge of Chevron's allegations, the New York Courts have continued to stay related litigation in New York, effectively remitting that litigation to the Ecuadorian courts: see the Huaorani Litigation summarised in Part IV(G)(9) above.\n\n8.66.\n\nFourth, there is evidence that Judge Zambrano was willing to be bribed by Chevron in return for a favourable result in the Lago Agrio Litigation (Chevron declined this offer). That initiative is also inconsistent with uniform judicial corruption in Ecuador dependent upon instructions from the Respondent's executive branch.\n\n8.67.\n\nLast but not least, as already indicated, the evidential materials regarding the Lago Agrio Court (including Judge Zambrano) are so overwhelming that the Claimants' broader allegations of corruption against the Ecuadorian legal system can add nothing to their proven primary case.\n\n8.68.\n\nIn Parts IV and V above, the Tribunal discounted, as a distinct matter in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment, the numerous public condemnatory statements regarding Chevron made by President Correa and members of his administration. As regards the Lago Agrio Litigation more generally, although particularly vicious in regard to Mr Veiga and Dr P\u00e9rez, Chevron's other legal representatives in Ecuador and (later) Dr Guerra, these statements were also not the cause of any injury sustained by the Claimants in the Lago Agrio Litigation or under the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\n8.69.\n\nMoreover, as the Respondent submitted, Governments sometimes resort to extreme political language as regards alleged damage to the environment caused by foreign oil companies.37 The Tribunal does not consider such political, even populist, statements by a State's executive branch, however regrettable, as amounting by themselves to a denial of justice. This applies necessarily to a situation where the sole cause for the denial of justice lies elsewhere within the State's judicial branch - as it does in the present case.\n\nThe Respondent cited the public condemnation in 2010 of \"British Petroleum\" by the President and Interior Secretary of the USA in regard to the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved fatalities and significant environmental pollution: see R-537 and R-621.\n\n8.70.\n\nThe Tribunal returns to the Claimants' summary of their case on denial of justice, as formulated at the end of the Track II Hearing, as follows:38\n\n*\"[There are] at least five separate and independent denials of justice: First, the Cabrera fraud, which the private and Government conspirators never quite managed to cleanse. Second, they paid [for ghostwritten orders] on behalf of the Plaintiffs; third, the Plaintiffs' ghostwriting of the Judgment using their own unfiled materials; fourth, the absurd and discriminatory fraudulent judgment itself imposing enormous liability by ignoring the environmental standards applicable to PetroEcuador and other companies, and then manufacturing environmental costs for remediation exponentially greater than those used anywhere else in the world. Now, the fifth denial of justice is Ecuador's response to the exposure of the first four. This goes directly to the question of when international liability will attach for misconduct that began in a country's courts\".*\n\nTrack II Hearing D.12.2756-2757.\n\n8.71.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided the first three allegations as related parts of Judge Zambrano's misconduct regarding the 'ghostwriting' of the Lago Agrio Judgment.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided the fifth allegation, to the effect that the Lago Agrio Judgment was left materially unremedied by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and (now) Constitutional Courts and the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities.\n\n8.72.\n\nAs regards the merits of the fourth allegation, relating to the Claimants' criticisms of 'junk science' or 'absurd' reasoning in the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to say more than it has already said in regard to this case's special features, namely the Respondent's cross-claim, in Parts VII(C)(2) and VII(C)(3) above.\n\n8.73.\n\nAccordingly, for denial of justice on the merits, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to base its decision on the Lago Agrio Judgment's treatment of environmental standards, including its assessment of causation and damages. As indicated above, the Tribunal bears in mind that similar environmental issues may yet be argued anew by the Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in resumed legal proceedings against Chevron, TexPet or Texaco. Albeit not binding upon these Plaintiffs, a decision by the Tribunal here as to this fourth allegation could prejudice the determination of these issues.\n\n8.74.\n\nIt is also unnecessary for this Tribunal to address these issues in this arbitration as regards the dispute between Claimants and the Respondent: the Lago Agrio Judgment as a whole has been successfully impugned by the Claimants on other grounds.\n\n8.75.\n\nThe Tribunal's reticence in regard to this fourth allegation, i.e. its necessary exercise of arbitral economy in this arbitration, should not be misunderstood. If there were to be individual claims for personal harm by the Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs (not being diffuse claims) in further legal proceedings, the Claimants may well be correct that the full costs for remediating all environmental damage by whomsoever caused in the former concession area would be less than US$ 100 million.39\n\nFebruary Hearing D1.10 (Mr Pate), referring to PetroEcuador's costs estimate.\n\n8.76.\n\n*(6) The Tribunal's Conclusion as to Denial of Justice:* As recited above, the Tribunal bases its decisions on the merits on the corrupt misconduct of the Lago Agrio Court in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation, together with the absence of any appropriate relief within the Respondent's own legal system from the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts and the conduct of the Respondent's prosecutorial authorities.\n\n8.77.\n\nFor these reasons, on the merits of the Claimants' claims for denial of justice, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent violated the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n***E: The Tribunal's Final Conclusions***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n8.78.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent is liable to make reparations to each of Chevron and TexPet for injuries caused by the breaches of the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and for breaches of the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, as further addressed in Parts IX and X below.\n\n***F: Postscript***\n-------------------\n\n8.79.\n\nThis postscript does not form part of the reasons in this Award, or its Operative Part.\n\n8.80.\n\nIf the Claimants' assessment (above) of the full costs of remediating environmental damage in the concession area were correct (as to which the Tribunal here expresses no conclusion), it is deeply regrettable that individual claims for personal harm caused by such damage were not amicably settled long ago, without the massive costs expended on the multiple lawsuits and arbitrations (including this arbitration) and, also, without the involvement of non-party funders and other third persons. The latter groups ostensibly rank in priority far above the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs for any proceeds from the Lago Agrio Litigation, as to which, again in the words of the Respondent's Counsel, the \"real plaintiffs\" with \"real claims\" are likely to receive nothing after 25 years of continuous litigation.\n\n8.81.\n\nThe Tribunal here bears in mind the remarks made by Mr Pate, Chevron's General Counsel, at the beginning of the Hearing on Interim Measures held on 11 February 2012, more than six years ago:40\n\n*\"... I will close by repeating what I said the last time I spoke before this Tribunal.41* *Chevron takes no pleasure in a dispute with any sovereign nation. We pride ourselves in working as good partners with nations who take a very broad spectrum of policy views. Chevron would welcome a constructive dialogue with Ecuador about this case and respects Ecuador's people and officials. So long as Ecuador continues to work in league with Mr Donziger, however, the result will be only further harm to the people, the civil society, and the reputation of Ecuador. Chevron invites Ecuador to change that course.\"*\n\nFebruary Hearing D1.10-11 (Mr Pate).\n\nThis was a reference to his opening statement at the Jurisdiction Hearing in November 2010 (D1,111ff). Later, Mr Pate made the same observations during the November Hearing (D1.8ff), and again at the Track 1B Hearing in April 2014 (D1.8ff).\n\n8.82.\n\nHowever, then as now, the amount of compensation resulting from any such \"constructive dialogue\", together with PetroEcuador's share with Chevron and TexPet for any liability regarding personal harm and environmental remediation in the concession area, lies beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n***PART IX*** - ***THE PARTIES' CLAIMS FOR RELIEF***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n9.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the Claimants' and the Respondent's material requests for relief in Track II as set out in Part I above, in the light of the decisions taken in this Award, together with the Tribunal's earlier awards, decisions and orders. These requests are taken, respectively, from the Claimant's letter dated 19 March 2018 (Section B with its marked-up Enclosure 1) and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018 (pp. 5-8, with its marked-up Enclosure 1).\n\n9.2.\n\nThe Tribunal has fully considered the Parties' respective written and oral submissions regarding their respective requests for relief. Given the several decisions made by the Tribunal in this Award, it is unnecessary to set out these submissions for the purpose of this Award, beyond the Parties' specific requests for relief.1\n\nAs regards the Parties' oral submissions on relief at the Track II Hearing, the Tribunal refers in particular to the Claimants' closing submissions at D12.2708ff and to the Respondent's closing submissions at D13.3011ff.\n\n***B: The Tribunal's General Approach***\n----------------------------------------\n\n9.3.\n\nAs set out in Part VIII above, on the evidence adduced in these proceedings, the Tribunal has found the Respondent in breach of its obligations towards Chevron and TexPet, for denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n9.4.\n\nAs explained in Parts VII and VIII above, the Tribunal considers that denial of justice under the Treaty's FET standard equates to denial of justice under customary international law, both falling within the scope of Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty. It follows that the Tribunal's finding regarding denial of justice under the FET standard equates with finding the Respondent also in breach of its obligations under customary international law for denial of justice.\n\n9.5.\n\nConversely, the Tribunal has not found the Respondent in breach of its obligations under the Treaty from the facts only that: (i) the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs commenced legal proceedings against Chevron before the Lago Agrio Court on 7 May 1993; (ii) the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs pleaded individual claims for personal harm against Chevron in their original Complaint filed in the Lago Agrio Litigation (not being diffuse claims);2 (iii) the Lago Agrio Court assumed jurisdiction over the Complaint (as regards non-diffuse claims), by reason of the undertaking in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction in the Aguinda Litigation; and (iv) certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' legal representatives in the Lago Agrio Litigation engaged in corrupt and other nefarious practices during the Lago Agrio Litigation (not attributable to the Respondent under international law).\n\nThis decision was reached by a majority of the Tribunal: see the Tribunal's Decision on Track IB.\n\n9.6.\n\nIn regard to the Claimants' material requests for relief regarding the Respondent's internationally wrongful acts, the Tribunal's starting-point comprises the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility,3 the judgments of the Permanent Court of International Justice in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* (1927 & 1928)4 and the judgment of the International Court of Justice in *Avena I* (2004).5\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries* (2001) II (Part Two) Yearbook of the ILC 31, CLA-291.\n\n*The Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, PCIJ, Judgment (Jurisdiction), 26 July 1927, 1927 PCIJ Series A No. 9; Judgment (Merits), 13 September 1928, 1928 PCIJ Series A No. 17, CLA-406.\n\n*Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America) I*, ICJ, Judgment, 31 March 2004, 2004 ICJ Reports 12.\n\n9.7.\n\nIn *Avena I (Mexico v USA)*, applying the general principles enunciated in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, the Court decided upon the form of reparation (inter alia) as follows:6\n\n*\"119. The general principle on the legal consequences of the commission of an internationally wrongful act was stated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w case as follows: 'It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.' (Factory at Chorz\u00f3w, Jurisdiction, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p. 21.) What constitutes 'reparation in an adequate form' clearly varies depending upon the concrete circumstances surrounding each case and the precise nature and scope of the injury, since the question has to be examined from the viewpoint of what is the 'reparation in an adequate form' that corresponds to the injury. In a subsequent phase of the same case, the Permanent Court went on to elaborate on this point as follows: 'The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act \u2013 a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals \u2013 is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.' (Factory at Chorz\u00f3w, Merits, 1928, PCIJ., Series A, No. 17,. p. 47).\"*\n\n*Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America) I*, ICJ, Judgment, 31 March 2004, 2004 ICJ Reports 12, para 119.\n\n9.8.\n\nIn that case, the Court identified the respondent State's internationally wrongful acts as the \"process\" of the domestic court proceedings (under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations), as distinct from \"the correctness as such of any conviction or sentencing\" *.* Accordingly, the Court concluded that:7\n\n*\"[121] \u2026 the internationally wrongful acts committed by the United States [sic; the United States of America] were the failure of its competent authorities to inform the Mexican nationals concerned, to notify Mexican consular posts and to enable Mexico to provide consular assistance. It follows that the remedy to make good these violations should consist in an obligation on the United States to permit review and reconsideration of these nationals' cases by the United States' courts, as the Court will explain further in paragraphs 128 to 134 below, with a view to ascertaining whether in each case the violation of Article 36 committed by the competent authorities caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process of administration of criminal justice.*\n\n*[122] The Court reaffirms that the case before it concerns Article 36 of the Vienna Convention [i.e. the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations] and not the correctness as such of any conviction or sentencing. The question of whether the violations of Article 36, paragraph 1, are to be regarded as having, in the causal sequence of events, ultimately led to convictions and severe penalties is an integral part of criminal proceedings before the courts of the United States and is for them to determine in the process of review and reconsideration. In so doing, it is for the courts of the United States to examine the facts, and in particular the prejudice and its causes, taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention.\"*\n\n*Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America) I*, ICJ, Judgment, 31 March 2004, 2004 ICJ Reports 12, paras 121-122.\n\n9.9.\n\nAs regards the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Tribunal refers, in particular, to Articles 16 and 28 to 38.8 An internationally wrongful act (which includes the violation of a treaty or of customary international law) entails the consequences set out in Part Two of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. These consequences include Article 28 (\"Legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act\"), Article 29 (\"Continued duty of performance\"), Article 30 (\"Cessation and non-repetition\"), Article 31 (\"Reparation\"), Article 32 (\"Irrelevance of Internal law\"), Article 33 (\"Scope of international obligations\") and Articles 34 to 38 on forms of reparation.\n\nThe relevant text of these ILC Articles on State Responsibility is fully set out in Part III above; see also CLA-291.\n\n9.10.\n\nIn regard to the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment before the courts of a third State (i.e. not Ecuador or the USA), the Claimants referred to Article 16 of Part One of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (\"Aid or assistance in the commission of an internationally wrongful act\").9 This Article provides that a State which aids or assists another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act entails the consequences set out in Part Two of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility if: (i) that State does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act and (ii) the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by that State. For this purpose, a denial of justice under customary international law would be such internationally wrongful act. As the International Court of Justice decided in the *Bosnia Genocide Case* (2007),10 Article 16 of the ILC Articles reflects a rule of customary international law.\n\nTrack II Hearing D12.2719ff.\n\n*Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)*, ICJ, Judgment, 26 February 2007, 2007 ICJ Reports 43, para 420, CLA-640.\n\n9.11.\n\nThe Tribunal adopts the general approach suggested by the ICJ in *Avena I,* to the effect that reparation for an internationally wrongful act varies, depending upon the concrete circumstances surrounding each case and the precise nature and scope of the injury under international law.\n\n9.12.\n\nThe Tribunal also follows the distinction drawn by the ICJ in *Avena I* between the \"process\" of the Lago Agrio Litigation leading to the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment and the \"correctness\" of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts.\n\n9.13.\n\nA similar distinction was drawn by the ICJ in the *Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant* (2002).11 In that case, the unlawful arrest warrant engaged the respondent State's international responsibility; but the warrant continued to exist, both as a matter of the local law and also international law. The Court held: \"The warrant is still extant and remains unlawful \u2026 The Court accordingly considers that Belgium must by means of its own choosing cancel the warrant in question...\". Significantly, the Court did not itself cancel the warrant. In the *Case Concerning Jurisdictional Immunities* (2012),12 the ICJ ordered the respondent State to take steps, by means of its own choosing, to ensure that decisions of its own courts \"become unenforceable\". Again, significantly, the ICJ did not itself annul or declare the nullity of these judicial decisions.\n\n*Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium*), ICJ, Judgment, 14 February 2002, 2002 ICJ Reports 3, para 76, CLA-415.\n\n*Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening)*, ICJ, Judgment, 3 February 2012, 2012 ICJ Reports 99, para 137, CLA-616.\n\n9.14.\n\nAccordingly, applying international law, the Tribunal does not consider that it has the power to annul the Lago Agrio Judgment as regards its lack of \"correctness\". Albeit unlawful under international law as to \"process\" (as decided by the Tribunal), the Lago Agrio Judgment exists as a concrete fact under Ecuadorian law, hence the Claimants' successive appeals to the Respondent's courts. Given such existence, the Lago Agrio Judgment has a legal effect and resulting consequences under international law. However, the remedy of annulment, as such, lies with the Respondent's internal law. This Tribunal has no power to apply such an internal remedy, as an international tribunal. It does, however, have the power to order the Respondent to take steps to secure that result.\n\n9.15.\n\nAs to international law, the Tribunal has decided that the Respondent breached its obligations, by a denial of justice, in issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment, rendering it enforceable and maintaining its enforceability by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.\n\n9.16.\n\nIn Part VIII above, as to the right of a party to receive a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal, the Tribunal has already referred to Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 2 and 6 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary. The violation of such a right by judicial corruption is proscribed by the UN Convention against Corruption ratified by the General Assembly on 31 October 2003 (to which the Respondent is a Contracting Party). In *World Duty Free* (2006), in the context of corruption by bribery, the tribunal identified, as a matter of international public policy, an international consensus as to universal standards and accepted norms of conduct that must be applied in all fora. It concluded: \"In light of domestic laws and international conventions relating to corruption, and in light of the decisions taken in this matter by courts and arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal is convinced that bribery is contrary to the international public policy of most, if not all, States \u2026\".13 In the Tribunal's view, judicial bribery must rank as one of the more serious cases of corruption, striking directly at the rule of law, access to justice and public confidence in the legal system; and also, as regards the foreign enforcement of a corrupt judgment, at the law of nations. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Lago Agrio Judgment (with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) violates international public policy. As a matter of international comity, it must follow that the Lago Agrio Judgment should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States.\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006, 46 ILM 339, para 157, RLA-548.\n\n9.17.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the reinstatement of the Claimants' rights under international law requires of the Respondent the immediate suspension of the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment and the implementation of such other corrective measures as are necessary to \"wipe out all the consequences\" of the Respondent's internationally wrongful acts, so as to re-establish the situation which would have existed if those internationally wrongful acts had not been committed by the Respondent.\n\n9.18.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these measures, subject to their elaboration in the form of declarations and orders below, are appropriate in the present circumstances of this case. These circumstances do not require the Tribunal itself to declare the nullity of the Lago Agrio Judgment under international law.\n\n9.19.\n\nFor the time being, contrary to the Claimants' submissions,14 the Tribunal is willing to assume that the Respondent will comply in good faith with this Award, in compliance with the Parties' Arbitration Agreement (as defined in Part I of this Award), the Treaty and the lex loci arbitri.\n\nTrack II Hearing D12.2733ff\n\n***C: The Claimants' Requests for Relief***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n9.20.\n\nFor this Track II, in the light of its general approach and decisions in this Award, the Tribunal addresses below the material relief sought by the Claimants in the form of the specific declarations and orders highlighted in green and purple in its marked-up Appendix A to their 19 March 2018 letter, recited in Annex 3(1) to Part I above:15\n\nAs designated by the Claimants, \"green\" signifies relief requested in Track II and \"purple\" relief requested in Tracks II and III. This \"purple\" relief is here marked \\*. In Annex 3 to Part I above, \"green\" is italicised and \"purple\" italicised and underlined.\n\n9.21.\n\nA3.3 Declaration 6: \"*Declare that Claimants have no liability or responsibility for satisfying the Lago Agrio Judgment because they were fully released for all such claims by the Settlement Agreements\".*\n\n9.22.\n\nThe Respondent, whether acting through its judicial branch or otherwise, was and remains bound to ensure, by means of its own choosing, that the Claimants have no liability or responsibility as regards diffuse claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. To such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.23.\n\nA3.3 Declaration 7: \"*Declare that the claims pleaded in the Lago Agrio Litigation (and upon which the Lago Agrio Judgment were based) are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel\".*\n\n9.24.\n\nThe Respondent was and remains bound to ensure, by means of its own choosing, that in accordance with the 1995 Settlement Agreement the Claimants are not exposed to liability or responsibility for diffuse claims in the courts of Ecuador. To such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.25.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 1: \"*Declaring that under the 1995, 1996 and 1998 Settlement and Release Agreements [the 1995 Settlement Agreement], Claimants have no liability or responsibility for environmental impact, including but not limited to any alleged liability for impact to human health, the ecosystem, indigenous cultures, the infrastructure, or any liability for unlawful profits, punitive damages or penalties, or for performing any further environmental remediation arising out of the former Consortium that was jointly owned by TexPet and Ecuador, or under the expired Concession Contract between TexPet and Ecuador\".*\n\n9.26.\n\nThis request is not granted save in regard to diffuse claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as explained in Paragraphs 9.22 and 9.24 above and set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.27.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 2: \"*Declaring that Ecuador has breached the 1995, 1996, and 1998 Settlement and Release Agreements\".*\n\n9.28.\n\nThe Respondent failed to observe its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, in breach of the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. To such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.29.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 3: *\"Ordering Ecuador to specifically perform the Settlement and Release Agreements.\"*\n\n9.30.\n\nThe Respondent is required to observe its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, in accordance with the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. To such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.31.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 4: *\"Declaring that Ecuador has breached the U.S.-Ecuador Treaty, including its obligations to afford fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, an effective means of enforcing rights, non-arbitrary treatment, non-discriminatory treatment, national treatment, and to observe obligations it entered into with regard to investments\".*\n\n9.32.\n\nThis request is granted in principle as regards: (i) denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (ii) the non-observation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.33.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 6: *\"Declaring that under the Treaty and applicable international law, Chevron is not liable for the Judgment\".*\n\n9.34.\n\nUnder Articles II(3)(a), Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty and customary international law, the Respondent (by its judicial branch) was obliged not to hold Chevron (or TexPet) liable under the Lago Agrio Judgment; and consequently the Claimants are, as a matter of international law, not obliged to comply with the Lago Agrio Judgment. To such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.35.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 7: \"*Declaring that Ecuador is exclusively liable for the Judgment.\"*\n\n9.36.\n\nThis request is granted as set out in this Award's Operative Part X, to the effect that any injury to the First or Second Claimant caused by the recognition or enforcement of any part of the Lago Agrio Judgment within or without Ecuador (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) shall be injuries for which the Respondent is liable to make full reparation under international law.\n\n9.37.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 8: *\"Nullifying the existence, validity, and all effects of the Judgment\".*\n\n9.38.\n\nThis request for nullification is not granted. Under its general approach above in Paragraphs 9.3 to 9.19, the Tribunal has decided that that a declaration of the nullity of the Lago Agrio Judgment is not an appropriate remedy under international law.\n\n9.39.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 9: *\"Ordering Ecuador to use all measures necessary to enjoin enforcement of the Judgment, including enjoining the nominal Plaintiffs or any Trust from obtaining any related attachments, levies or other enforcement devices\".*\n\n9.40.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's decisions in Paragraphs 9.22 and 9.24 above, the Respondent is obliged to use measures of its own choosing to prevent the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Save to such extent, this request is not granted except as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.41.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 10: *\"Ordering that, in the event that any court orders the recognition or enforcement of the Judgment, Ecuador must satisfy the Judgment directly\".*\n\n9.42.\n\nThis request is not granted, save as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.43.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 11\\*: *\"Awarding Claimants indemnification against Ecuador in connection with the Judgment, including a specific obligation by Ecuador to pay Claimants the sum of money awarded in the Judgment\".*\n\n9.44.\n\nThis request is not granted in this Award, any such indemnity or payment being issues allocated to Track III as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.45.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 12\\*: *\"Awarding Claimants any sums that the nominal Lago Agrio Plaintiffs collect against Claimants or their affiliates in connection with enforcing the Judgment, including the amounts embargoed thus far\".*\n\n9.46.\n\nThis request is not granted in this Award, any such sums being issues allocated to Track III as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.47.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 14: *\"Ordering Ecuador to make a written representation to any court in which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust attempt to recognize and enforce the Judgment that: \u2026 (ii) the Lago Agrio Court had no personal or subject-matter jurisdiction over Chevron; \u2026 (v) any enforcement of the Judgment places Ecuador in violation of its international law obligations\".*\n\n9.48.\n\nThis request is not granted as regards sub-paragraph (ii): see Part VIII above (Paragraph 8.63). As regards sub-paragraph (v), it is granted in principle, as set out above in Paragraphs 9.22, 9.24 and 9.40 and in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.49.\n\nA3.4: Declaration 17: *\"Any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.\"*\n\n9.50.\n\nThis general request has been addressed by the Tribunal in its several decisions above, subject to any further relief to be addressed in Track III. The Tribunal does not think it necessary to address here this general request any further.\n\n9.51.\n\nA3.5B: Order: *\"Claimants also request that the Tribunal provide for a subsequent phase in this arbitration to determine all costs and attorneys' fees that should be awarded to Claimants for being forced to (i) pursue this arbitration; (ii) uncover the Judgment fraud; and (iii) defend against enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in any jurisdiction\".*\n\n9.52.\n\nThis request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.53.\n\nA3.8A: Declaration 1: *\"By issuing the Judgment and rendering it enforceable within and without Ecuador, Ecuador committed a denial of justice under international law and breached provisions of the Treaty.\"*\n\n9.54.\n\nThis request is granted in principle, as set out this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.55.\n\nA3.8A: Declaration 3: *\"The court [1] rendering the Judgment asserted jurisdiction illegitimately and was not competent in the international sphere [2] to try the Lago Agrio case and [3] to pass judgment.\"*\n\n9.56.\n\nThis request (as directed at the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation) is not granted as regards [1] and [2]: see Part VIII above (Paragraph 8.63).\n\n9.57.\n\nAs regards [3], this request (as directed at the terms of the Lago Agrio Judgment) is granted in principle insofar as the Judgment is inconsistent with the Respondent's obligations under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty, as decided above in Paragraphs 9.22, 9.24, 9.40 and 9.48 and as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.58.\n\nA3.8A: Declaration 4: *\"The Judgment was issued in a process that violated general standards of due process and in which Chevron did not have an opportunity to present its defense.\"*\n\n9.59.\n\nThis request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.60.\n\nA3.8A: Declaration 5: *\"The Judgment is a nullity as a matter of international law\".*\n\n9.61.\n\nThis request is not granted. As decided above in Paragraph 9.38, under its general approach described in Paragraphs 9.3 to 9.19, the Tribunal has decided that a declaration of the nullity of the Lago Agrio Judgment is not an appropriate remedy under international law.\n\n9.62.\n\nA3.8A: Declaration 6: *\"The Judgment is [1] unlawful and [2] consequently devoid of any legal effect {under international law}16**.\"*\n\nThe words \"under international law\" in this Declaration 6 were added by the Claimants at the Track II Hearing: see D12.2514.\n\n9.63.\n\nAs to unlawfulness under the Treaty (including customary international law), the first part of this request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X. The second part is not granted. As decided above in Paragraphs 9.38 and 9.61, under its general approach described in Paragraphs 9.3 to 9.19, the Tribunal does not consider that such a declaration for the Lago Agrio Judgment is an appropriate remedy under international law.\n\n9.64.\n\nA3.8A: Declaration 10\\*: *\"By taking measures to enforce the Judgment against assets within Ecuador, and taking measures to facilitate enforcement of the Judgment in other jurisdictions, Ecuador [1] is in breach of its obligations under the Treaty, and [2] must indemnify Claimants and any of their affiliates for any sum of money collected from them as a result of the Judgment\".*\n\n9.65.\n\nAs the first part, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award's Operative Part X, given the order dated 1 March 2012 of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court declaring the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment and the Respondent's judicial branch maintaining such enforceability (see Part IV above). As to the second part, this request is not granted in this Award, any such indemnity being allocated to Track III, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.66.\n\nA3.8B: Order 5: *\"To abstain from collecting or accepting any proceeds arising from or in connection with the enforcement or execution of the Judgment, and to return to Claimants any such proceeds that may come into Respondent's possession\".*\n\n9.67.\n\nThis request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.68.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 1: *\"The Lago Agrio Litigation is exclusively a diffuse-rights case\".*\n\n9.69.\n\nThis request is not granted: the Tribunal refers to its Decision (by a majority) dated 12 March 2015 in Track IB.\n\n9.70.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 2: \"*The 1999 EMA has no legal effect on the Settlement and Release Agreements [the 1995 Settlement Agreement]\".*\n\n9.71.\n\nThis request is not granted, in the general form requested. In its Decision on Track 1B, the Tribunal decided (by a majority) that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as an initial pleading, included individual claims resting upon personal rights under Ecuadorian law, not being diffuse claims falling within the scope of the release under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal also decided that Article 43 of the 1999 Environmental Management Act (the \"EMA\") could not by itself convert what was otherwise a personal claim by an individual into a diffuse claim. Conversely, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs could not succeed in bringing a diffuse claim before the Ecuadorian Courts, not being an individual claim for personal harm, without the Respondent breaching the 1995 Settlement Agreement: see Paragraphs 168 and 186(1) of the Decision on Track IB. In these circumstances, the Tribunal thinks it unnecessary to answer the request any further in this Award.\n\n9.72.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 3: *\"The Lago Agrio Litigation was barred at its inception by res judicata.\"*\n\n9.73.\n\nThis request is not granted. As already indicated, by its Decision on Track IB, the Tribunal decided (by a majority) that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as an initial pleading, included individual claims resting upon personal rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, and that the Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by res judicata, under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement: see paragraphs 186(1) and 186(2) of the Decision on Track 1B.\n\n9.74.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 4: *\"By issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment and rendering it enforceable within and without Ecuador, Ecuador violated various provisions of the Treaty.\"*\n\n9.75.\n\nThis request, albeit in different forms of wording, has already been addressed above in Paragraphs 9.28, 9.32, 9.54, 9.57, 9.63 and 9.65. The Tribunal has decided that the Respondent (by its judicial branch) failed to comply with its obligations under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, by the issuance and enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment resulting from the conduct of the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court. The Tribunal does not therefore consider it necessary to grant this further relief, as a matter of surplusage; and it is not granted.\n\n9.76.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 5: *\"By issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment on diffuse claims barred as res judicata, Ecuador breached the 1995, 1996 and 1998 Settlement and Release Agreements, and also violated Chevron's rights under the Treaty.\"*\n\n9.77.\n\nThis Tribunal repeats its decision above in Paragraph 9.75; and this request is therefore not granted.\n\n9.78.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 6: *\"The Lago Agrio Judgment is a nullity as a matter of international law.\"*\n\n9.79.\n\nThis request is not granted. (It repeats the requests addressed above under Paragraphs 9.38, 9.61 and 9.63; and the Tribunal provides the same reason for its decision).\n\n9.80.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 7: *\"The Lago Agrio Judgment is [1] unlawful and [2] consequently devoid of any legal effect.\"*\n\n9.81.\n\nAs to the first part, this request is granted in principle, as already decided above in Paragraph 9.63 and as set out in this Award's Operative Part X. As to the second part, the Tribunal repeats its decision above in Paragraph 9.38; this request repeats the similar request addressed above under Paragraphs 9.61 and 9.63; the Tribunal does not therefore consider it necessary to grant this further relief, as a matter of surplusage; and it is not granted.\n\n9.82.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 8: *\"The Lago Agrio Judgment is a violation of Chevron's rights under the Treaty, and is not entitled to enforcement within or without Ecuador.\"*\n\n9.83.\n\nThis request is granted in principle, as already decided above in Paragraphs 9.40 and 9.63 and as set out in this Award's Operative Part X. The Tribunal does not therefore consider it necessary to consider this request separately.\n\n9.84.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 9: *\"The Lago Agrio Judgment violates international public policy and natural justice, and that as a matter of international comity and public policy, the Lago Agrio Judgment should not be recognized and enforced\".*\n\n9.85.\n\nThis request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.86.\n\nA3.9A: Declaration 10\\*: *\"By: (i) taking measures to enforce the Judgment against assets within Ecuador, and (ii) taking measures to facilitate enforcement of the Judgment in other jurisdictions, Ecuador is in breach of its obligations under the Treaty, and must compensate Claimants for any sum of money collected by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and/or their agents as a result of the Judgment\".*\n\n9.87.\n\nThis request repeats the similar request addressed above under Paragraph 9.65. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here separately, save that all issues relating to compensation are allocated to Track III, as also set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.88.\n\nA3.9B: Order 1: *\"To take all measures necessary to set aside or nullify the Lago Agrio Judgment under Ecuadorian law.\"*\n\n9.89.\n\nThis request, albeit in different forms of wording, has already been addressed above in Paragraphs 9.38, 9.61, 9.63 and 9.81. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here separately.\n\n9.90.\n\nA3.9B: Order 2: *\"To take all measures necessary to prevent enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the Lago Agrio Judgment\".*\n\n9.91.\n\nThis request, albeit in different form of wording, has already been addressed above in Paragraphs 9.40, 9.63 and 9.83. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here separately.\n\n9.92.\n\nA3.9B: Order 3: *\"To take all measures necessary to prevent the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust from obtaining any related attachments, levies, or other enforcement devices under the impugned Judgment.\"*\n\n9.93.\n\nThis request, albeit in different form of wording, has already been addressed above in Paragraph 9.40. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here separately.\n\n9.94.\n\nA3.9B: Order 4: *\"To make a written representation to any court in which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust attempt to recognize and enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment that: (i) the claims that formed the basis of the Lago Agrio Judgment were validly released under Ecuadorian law by the Government; (ii) the Lago Agrio Judgment is a legal nullity; and (iii) any enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment will place Ecuador in violation of its obligations under the Treaty\".*\n\n9.95.\n\nThis request is not granted, save as otherwise ordered in this Award's Operative Part X (see also the decisions regarding the similar request in Paragraph 9.48 above).\n\n9.96.\n\nParagraph 47: *\"Claimants' requested relief is without prejudice to all other remedies sought in relation to Track II or any other remedy that may effectively protect Claimants' rights, including a damage remedy as part of Track III.\"*\n\n9.97.\n\nTo the extent necessary and appropriate, the Tribunal defers to Track III this general request as to any undecided issues outstanding from Track I, IB and II.\n\n***D: The Respondent's Requests for Relief***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n9.98.\n\nIn the circumstances, it is possible to decide the Respondent's requests for relief more succinctly. As with the Claimants' requests for relief, it is appropriate to set out the Respondent's material requests in the form submitted to the Tribunal.\n\n9.99.\n\nIn its letter dated 20 April 2018, the Respondent limited its pleaded requests for relief for Track II to \"those prayers referring to findings of jurisdiction and State responsibility\", with \"prayers that refer to remedy\" assigned to Track III, along with (i) the 'show cause' issues related to the Tribunal's Fourth Interim Award; (ii) the Respondent's application of 1 March 2013 for \"Reconsideration of the First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards\" and (iii) any quantum issues (page 8 of its letter). Moreover, the Respondent has confirmed its agreement that all issues of costs be assigned to Track III (see below).\n\n9.100.\n\nFor this Track II, in the light of its general approach and decisions in this Award, the Tribunal addresses below the material relief sought by the Respondent in the form of the specific declarations and orders as marked-up in its Attachment 1, recited in Annex 3(2) to Part I above:17\n\nAs designated by the Respondent, \"red\" signifies relief requested in Track II and \"blue\" relief requested in Track III. See Annex 3 to Part I above.\n\n9.101.\n\n*A3.12(b): \"Dismisses on the merits Chevron's claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release [i.e., collectively, \"the 1995 Settlement Agreement\"].\"*\n\n9.102.\n\nThis request is not granted, as regards the Claimants' claims under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n9.103.\n\nA3.12(c): *\"Dismisses on the merits TexPet's claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release.\"*\n\n9.104.\n\nThis request is not granted, as regards the Claimants' claims under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n9.105.\n\nA3.12(d): *\"Declares specifically that the Respondent has not breached the 1995 Settlement Agreement or the 1998 Final Release\".*\n\n9.106.\n\nThis request is not granted, as regards the Claimants' claims under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n9.107.\n\nA3.12(e): *\"Dismisses all of Claimants' claims as they relate to the 1996 Local Settlements, reached between TexPet and local government entities\".*\n\n9.108.\n\nThis request is not granted, subject to this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.109.\n\nA3.12(f): *\"Declares that the Lago Agrio Litigation was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel.\"*\n\n9.110.\n\nIn its Decision dated 12 March 2015 in Track IB, the Tribunal decided (by a majority) that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003 of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs was not wholly barred at its inception by res judicata, under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Save as aforesaid, this request is not granted.\n\n9.111.\n\nA3.16(a): *\"Declaring that it [the Tribunal] lacks jurisdiction over Claimants' denial of justice and related treaty claims against the Republic.\"*\n\n9.112.\n\nThis request is not granted.\n\n9.113.\n\nA3.16(b): *\"Alternatively, assuming the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction over the denial of justice and Treaty claims, dismissing Claimants' denial of justice and related treaty claims against the Republic as not ripe for adjudication under international law in light of Claimants' failure to exhaust available local remedies, and as otherwise meritless.\"*\n\n9.114.\n\nThis request is not granted.\n\n9.115.\n\nA3.16(c): *\"Declaring that Claimants do not possess the rights they claim to have under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local Settlements in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation.\"*\n\n9.116.\n\nThis request is not granted, subject to this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.117.\n\nA3.16(d): *\"Declaring further that no breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local Settlements occurred in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation.\"*\n\n9.118.\n\nThis request is not granted.\n\n***E: Miscellaneous***\n----------------------\n\n9.119.\n\n*Compensation:* The Tribunal decides, confirming its earlier procedural orders, that all issues of quantum shall be addressed in Track III of these arbitration proceedings. These issues shall include issues as to reparation in the form of compensation for injuries sustained by the First Claimant or the Second Claimant, as pleaded by the Claimants, including any assessment of the amount of compensation, moral damages, indemnities, reimbursements, payments, expenses and interest. Track III may also address, to the extent still relevant, issues of non-compensatory restitution.\n\n9.120.\n\n*Costs* : The Parties are agreed and the Tribunal here confirms that all issues relating to legal and arbitration costs under Articles 38-40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules are deferred to a later stage of these arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that it would be useful for the Parties to provide breakdowns of the amounts of their respective claims for legal costs to date, as set out in as set out in this Award's Operative Part X.\n\n9.121.\n\n*Track III Issues* : Subject to any further order of the Tribunal otherwise, the issues for Track III shall include: (i) compensation (as described above); (ii) the Parties' extant requests for relief left undecided in this Award, as identified in their respective letters dated 19 March and 20 April 2018 (including any extant issues as to non-compensatory restitution); (iii) the 'show cause' issues as to compensation claimed by the Claimants for the Respondent's violations of the Tribunal's First and Second Interim Awards on Interim Measures; and (iv) the Respondent's application for the reconsideration of the Tribunal's First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards.\n\n***PART X*** - ***THE OPERATIVE PART***\n---------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n10.1.\n\n**For the reasons set out in this Award, based on the evidential materials adduced in these arbitration proceedings together with its earlier awards, orders and decision, the Tribunal makes the following declarations and orders under the Treaty and international law:**\n\n***B: Declarations as to Jurisdiction and Admissibility***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.2.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction under Article VI of the Treaty over the claims pleaded in this arbitration by the First Claimant (Chevron) and the Second Claimant (TexPet) under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty;

and the Tribunal rejects all objections as to non-admissibility pleaded by the Respondent.**\n\n***C: Declarations as to the Merits***\n--------------------------------------\n\n10.4.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011 (as clarified by order of 4 March 2011) were corruptly 'ghostwritten' for Judge Nicol\u00e1s Zambrano Lozada, as a judge of the Lago Agrio Court, by one or more of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives in return for a promise by such representative(s) to pay to Judge Zambrano a bribe from the proceeds of the Lago Agrio Judgment's enforcement by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs;**\n\n10.5.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that the Respondent, by issuing, rendering enforceable, maintaining the enforceability and executing the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) and knowingly facilitating its enforcement outside Ecuador, wrongfully committed a denial of justice under the standards both for fair and equitable treatment and for treatment required by customary international law under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty;**\n\n10.6.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that the Respondent is liable to make full reparation to the First Claimant and the Second Claimant for denial of justice under the standards both for fair and equitable treatment and for treatment required by customary international law under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and the Tribunal rejects the defences pleaded by the Respondent;**\n\n10.7.\n\n**The Tribunal (by a majority) declares, confirming its Decision on Track IB, that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 1998, as an initial pleading, included individual claims (for personal harm) resting upon individual rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and that, therefore, the Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by res judicata under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement;**\n\n10.8.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that the said Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) decided only diffuse claims as distinct from individual claims for personal harm by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, whereby the Respondent violated its obligations towards the First Claimant and the Second Claimant as \"Releasees\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement;**\n\n10.9.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that the Respondent is liable to make full reparation to the First Claimant and the Second Claimant under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty for the non-observation of its obligations towards each of them as a \"Releasee\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and the Tribunal rejects the defences pleaded by the Respondent;**\n\n10.10.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that, given the Respondent's said denial of justice, the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) grossly violated the fundamental procedural rights of the First Claimant (including its rights of defence); the said Lago Agrio Judgment (as thus decided) is contrary to international public policy; and no part of the said Lago Agrio Judgment should be recognised or enforced by any State with knowledge of the Respondent's said denial of justice;**\n\n10.11.\n\n**The Tribunal declares that any injury to the First Claimant or the Second Claimant caused by the recognition or enforcement of any part of the Lago Agrio Judgment within or without Ecuador (as decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) shall be injuries for which the Respondent is liable to make reparation under international law;**\n\n10.12.\n\n**For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal declares and confirms that neither this Award nor any of its earlier awards, orders and decision precludes a claim by any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs against the First or Second Claimants made for personal harm in respect of his or her individual rights, not being a diffuse claim within the meaning of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.**\n\n***D: Orders as to the Merits***\n--------------------------------\n\n10.13.\n\n**The Respondent shall, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal and as unconditional obligations of result (save where otherwise indicated):**\n\n**(i) Take immediate steps, of its own choosing, to remove the status of****enforceability from the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts);**\n\n**(ii) take immediate steps, of its own choosing, to preclude any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, any \"trust\" purporting to represent their interests (including the \"Frente de Defensa La Amazonia\"), any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' representatives, and any non-party funder from enforcing any part of the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts), directly or indirectly, whether by attachment, arrest, interim injunction, execution or howsoever otherwise;**\n\n**(iii) on notice from the First or Second Claimants, advise promptly in writing any State (including its judicial branch), where the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs may be seeking directly or indirectly, now or in the future, the enforcement or recognition of any part of the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) of this Tribunal's declarations and orders regarding the Respondent's internationally wrongful acts comprising a denial of justice resulting from the Lago Agrio Judgment (as thus decided); and, for this purpose (being required by legal duty or to pursue a legal right), any Party shall be entitled, notwithstanding Article 32(5) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, to disclose to the State's judicial branch (on whatever terms that its courts may order) a copy of this Award and its earlier awards, orders and decision;**\n\n**(iv) abstain from collecting or receiving, directly or indirectly, any proceeds from the enforcement or recognition of any part of the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) within or without Ecuador;**\n\n**(v) return promptly to the First Claimant any such proceeds that (notwithstanding the foregoing) come into the Respondent's custody, possession or control;**\n\n**(vi) take corrective measures, of its own choosing, to \"wipe out all the consequences\" of all the Respondent's internationally wrongful acts in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts), within the meaning of Article 31 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, excepting only reparation in the form of compensation (as to which, see Section E below);**\n\n**(vii) comply with its obligations towards the First Claimant and the Second Claimant as \"Releasees\" under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, in accordance with Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty; and**\n\n**(viii) subject to further order of this Tribunal in Track III, make full reparation in the form of compensation for any injuries caused to the First Claimant and the Second Claimant by the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts).**\n\n***E: Compensation***\n---------------------\n\n10.14.\n\n**All issues as to reparation in the form of compensation for any injuries sustained by the First or Second Claimant, as claimed by the Claimants and denied by the Respondent, including any assessment of the amount of compensation, moral damages, indemnities, reimbursements, payments, expenses and interest, are currently assigned for further submissions by the Parties to Track III. These issues are not decided in this Award.**\n\n***F: Legal and Arbitration Costs***\n------------------------------------\n\n10.15.\n\n**All issues relating to the allocation and assessment of costs and expenses (within the meaning of Articles 38-40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), as claimed by the Claimants and the Respondent, are currently assigned for further submissions by the Parties later in these arbitration proceedings. These issues are not decided in this Award;**\n\n10.16.\n\n**Nonetheless, so as to facilitate this later exercise as to assessment, the Claimants and the Respondent shall submit written summaries (not to exceed ten pages) of their respective claimed amounts for costs and expenses to date, to be submitted to the Tribunal not later than 90 days following the date of this Award. These summaries shall contain only a breakdown of the claimed amounts and shall not include any submissions as to the merits of the Parties' respective claims for costs (including issues of allocation).**\n\n***G: Miscellaneous***\n----------------------\n\n10.17.\n\n**The Parties' extant requests for relief, as marked-up in the enclosures to their respective letters dated 19 March and 20 April 2018 for Track III, shall be addressed by the Parties in Track III of these arbitration proceedings;**\n\n10.18.\n\n**The Tribunal confirms, as declared in its Fourth Interim Award on Interim Measures dated 7 February 2013, that the Respondent violated its First and Second Interim Awards on Interim Measures dated 25 January and 16 February 2012 in breach of Article VI of the Treaty, Article 32(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and international law;**\n\n10.19.\n\n**In accordance with the Tribunal's said Fourth Interim Award, at Paragraph 2 of Part IV (page 31), the 'show cause' issues relating to compensation claimed by the First and Second Claimants for the Respondent's violations of the said First and Second Interim Awards shall be addressed by the Parties in Track III of these arbitration proceedings;**\n\n10.20.\n\n**The Respondent's application of 1 March 2013 for the reconsideration of the Tribunal's First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards shall be further addressed by the Parties in Track III of these arbitration proceedings;**\n\n10.21.\n\n**In the light of this Award, not later than 90 days following the date of this Award, any Party may apply to the Tribunal for permission to add any further issue or request for relief to be addressed by the Parties in Track III of these arbitration proceedings;**\n\n10.22.\n\n**Further, in the light of this Award, not later than 90 days following the date of this Award, the Respondent may (in writing) show cause why the Tribunal should not vary Paragraph 4 of its Second Interim Award on Interim Measures by ordering the release to the Claimants of the amount of US$ 50 million deposited by the Claimants with the Permanent Court of Arbitration as security for the Claimants' contingent responsibility to the Respondent in regard to such interim measures; and**\n\n10.23.\n\n**Save as aforesaid, the requests for relief made by the First and Second Claimants for decision in this Track II are not granted; and the requests for relief made by the Respondent for decision in this Track II are not granted.**"}]}
