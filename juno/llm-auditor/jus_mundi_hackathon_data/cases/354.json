PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Centre received the Claimants' Request for Arbitration on July 20, 2012.\nThe Secretary -General registered the Request for Arbitration on August 21, 2012, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of\u00a0Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States ['ICSID\u00a0Convention\" or \"Convention\"I.

On July 18, 2013, the Parties were informed that\u00a0Professor Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto had accepted his appointment.\n10. On July 18, 2013, the Secretary -General notified the Parties that the three\u00a0members of the Tribunal had accepted their respective appointments and the\u00a0Tribunal was thus deemed to be constituted, and the proceedings begun, on said\u00a0date, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 6. Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, Legal Counsel at\u00a0ICSID, was appointed Secretary of the Tribunal.\nii. The Tribunal's first session and preliminary procedural consultation with the\u00a0Parties took place on September 12, 2013, by telephone conference call. In\u00a0addition to the three Members and the Secretary of the Tribunal, the following\u00a0individuals participated in the call:\nFor the Claimants:\nIgnacio Hellmund Nigel Blackaby\u00a0Caroline S Richard\u00a0Jeffery P Commission\nTenaris S.A.\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\u00a0Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\nFor the Respondent:\n16\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 20 of 201\nManuel Enrique Galindo Magaly Gutienez Vifla\u00a0Yarubith Escobar\u00a0Ronald E.M.

Among other\u00a0things, said Procedural Order provides that the Tribunal was constituted in\u00a0accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and that the\u00a0members of the Tribunal submitted their respective signed declarations pursuant\u00a0to Arbitration Rule 6(2); it also memorializes the Parties' agreement on the\u00a0following subjects: that the Parties raised no objection to the appointment of any\u00a0of the Tribunal's members and, therefore, the Tribunal was properly constituted;\u00a0the application of the Arbitration Rules of April 2006; agreements as to the\u00a0languages of the proceedings, including the Parties' agreement that the Award be\u00a0issued in Spanish only; and the procedural schedule.\nIn accordance with the procedural schedule, as amended upon the Parties' agreement on October 15, 2013, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the\u00a0Merits on October 21, 2013.\nBifurcation and Subsequent Joining of the Proceedings\nOn November 25, 2013, the Respondent submitted a request seeking to have two objections to jurisdiction ruled upon as a preliminary issue.

On July 10, 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that it had accepted, on a pro\u00a0tern basis, their agreement to join the jurisdiction and merits stages, reserving,\u00a0however, the right to revise its decision. Moreover, the Tribunal confirmed the\u00a0new dates of the procedural schedule and the lifting of the stay of the merits\u00a0proceedings since July 2, 2014, in accordance with the Parties' agreement. The\u00a0procedural schedule dates were reviewed again, with the dates set for the hearing\u00a0standing unchanged.\nThe Pre -Hearing Joined Proceedings\n20. After consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed the dates for the\u00a0hearing on August 12, 2014.\n21. In accordance with the revised procedural schedule, the Respondent submitted\u00a0its Counter -Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits on October 21, 2014.\n22. On November 5, 2014, the President proposed to the Parties that Ms. Melanie\u00a0Riofrio Pich\u00e9, an associate at Armesto & Asociados, be appointed Assistant to\u00a0the Tribunal, and requested their approval. On November 17, 2014, the Parties\u00a0confirmed they had no objection to Ms. Riofrio Pich\u00e9 being appointed Assistant\u00a0to the Tribunal.\n23. On December 31, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties\u00a0an additional declaration by Mr. G\u00f3mez-Pinz\u00f3n. The Parties confirmed they had\u00a0no objections to the content of the additional declaration submitted by Mr.\u00a0G\u00f3mez- Pinz\u00f3n on December 31, 2014 and January 15, 2015, respectively.\n24.

On the same date, through simultaneous\u00a0separate communications, the Parties submitted their comments on the points on\u00a0which no agreement had been reached.\n28. On May 27, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, since they had reached\u00a0an agreement on the majority of the relevant issues, a pre -hearing telephone\u00a0conference call would not be necessary.\n29. On May 27 and 28, 2015, the Parties notified the order in which their witnesses\u00a0would be called at the hearing.\nE11\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 22 of 201\n30. On June 2, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, containing the\u00a0Parties' procedural agreements and the Tribunal's decisions on the disputed\u00a0issues in connection with the organization of the hearing.\n31. On June 3, 2015, the Claimants requested that several new documents, as well as\u00a0additional passages from documents already on the record, be placed on the case\u00a0record.1 On June 9, 2015, the Respondent submitted its observations on the\u00a0Claimants' request, and requested leave to correct one of its own exhibits. On\u00a0June 8, 2015, the Claimants requested permission to introduce a new document.\u00a0The Respondent replied to the Claimants' request on June 10, 2015.\n32. The Tribunal ruled on June 11, 2015. Given the approaching date of the hearing\u00a0and considering the need for the Parties to be certain as to which documents had\u00a0been allowed and which ones rejected prior to the hearing, in its ruling the\u00a0Tribunal announced its decision without stating detailed reasons. Moreover, the\u00a0Tribunal invited the Parties to state whether they wished to be provided with\u00a0detailed reasoning for the Tribunal's ruling. The Respondent requested such\u00a0statement of reasons on June 12, 2015.

The Claimants note that:11\n\"To the extent this Tnbunal concludes that Tenaris's investments in Tavsa have been indirectly expropriated and the Tribunal awards compensation\u00a0using a valuation date of April 30, 2008, then Tenaris will have been made\u00a0whole and it will not be necessary for the Tribunal to consider whether\u00a0Venezuela has breached the fair and equitable treatment provision of the\u00a0Luxembourg Treaty. If, however, the Tribunal uses a 2009 valuation date, it\u00a0will be necessaiy for the Tribunal to consider whether Venezuela's\u00a0measures following the enactment of the Nationalization Decree 6058\u00a0breached the fair and equitable treatment clause of the Luxembourg Treaty\u00a0and if so, establish compensation at a date prior to Venezuela's breaches of\u00a0that Treaty.\"12\n\"To the extent this Tribunal concludes that Claimants' investments in Comsigua have been indirectly expropriated and the Tribunal awards\u00a0compensation using a valuation date of April 30, 2008 in a principal amount\u00a0not less than the pro rata sum attributed to each of the minority Japanese\u00a0Shareholders (i.e. US$24.1 million), then it will not be necessary for the\u00a0Tribunal to consider whether or not Venezuela has separately breached the\u00a0fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination and/or the most -favored -nation (MFN) clauses in the Treaties. If the Tribunal concludes that\u00a0Claimants' investments in Comsigua have not been expropriated, or\u00a0calculates compensation for expropriation in an amount less than the pro\u00a0rata share attributed to the Japanese Shareholders, then it should proceed to\u00a0address Claimants' claim under the non-discrimination and/or MFN clauses\u00a0and order the payment of compensation to the Claimants for their shares in\u00a0Comsigua at the pro rata sum attributed to each of the minority Japanese\u00a0Shareholders.

INTRODUCTION\n52. The core dispute19 arises from the alleged expropriations20 of the Claimants'\u00a0investments in two Venezuelan companies: a steel tube manufacturer (Tubos de\u00a0Acero de Venezuela S.A. ['Tavsa\"I) and an iron manufacturer (Complejo\u00a0Sider\u00fcrgico de Guayana C.A. ['Comsigua\"I). In addition, these companies are\u00a0alleged to have suffered (as per the Claimant's claims) unfair and inequitable\u00a0treatment. This second argument is raised subsidiarily to the expropriation claim,\u00a0as the compensation sought for the expropriation would also cover the\u00a0compensation due on account of such unfair and inequitable treatment.\n53. The Claimants are members of the Techint Group, an international conglomerate\u00a0operating in the steel industry, consisting of several groups of companies,\u00a0including Tenaris (the first Claimant) and Ternium S.A. ['Ternium\"I.\n54. Tenaris is a Luxembourg holding company,21 with 26 main subsidiaries, and it is\u00a0listed in the main stock exchanges in the United States, Italy, Argentina, and\u00a0Mexico.22 It has two wholly -owned subsidiaries that are relevant to this\u00a0arbitration:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talta:23 the second Claimant and a Portuguese company.24 Talta - and,\nindirectly, Tenaris - holds 7.58% of Comsigua's stock - one of the two allegedly expropriated companies.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tubos de Acero de Mexico S.A. ['Tamsa\"I:25 a Mexican company holding\n70% of Tavsa's stock26 - the second company the Claimants contend was expropriated.\n55. The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; it denies having\u00a0breached the BITs, and it therefore rejects any damages claim. Venezuela also\u00a0raised as a preliminary objection the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction over this\u00a0dispute.\n19 Subsidiarily, the Claimants also claim to have suffered other breaches of the BITs.\n20 Strictly speaking, Venezuela acknowledges Tavsa's expropriation and only challenges Comsigua's. For ease of\u00a0reference, the Arbitral Tribunal will jointly refer to the \"alleged expropriations.\"\n21 Extract of the Luxembourg Registry of Commerce and Corporations for Tenaris, May 24, 2012, Exhibit C-6.\n22 Tenaris S.A., 2014 Annual Report, Exhibit R-116, p. 31.\n23 Talta, and indirectly Tenaris, also acquired a 50.2% shareholding in Orinoco Iron, Materiales Sider\u00fcrgicos S.A.\u00a0(Matesi), another Venezuelan HBI producer. Such investment and its alleged subsequent expropriation are the subject -matter of a separate ICSID arbitration: Tenaris S.A. y Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v.\u00a0Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/1 1/26).\n24 Permanent Certificate of Talta, May 18, 2012, Exhibit C-8.\n25 Shareholders Registry of Tamsa, July 6, 2012, Exhibit C-22.\n26 Certificate of Commercial Registry of Puerto Ordaz of CVG Tubos, November 23, 1998, Exhibit C-85, p. 8; Strategic\u00a0Partnership Agreement, October 9, 1998, Exhibit C-19, clause 2.1.\n26\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 30 of 201\n56. There is a significant portion of the factual background of this Award that is\u00a0shared by both companies, Tavsa and Comsigua, as well as both investors,\u00a0Tenaris and Talta, respectively. Where so, the Award will jointly refer to the\u00a0companies or the \"investment,\" as well as the \"Claimants\" in the plural.\u00a0However, whenever the facts and/or arguments impact one or the other company\u00a0differently, the Award will address Tavsa and Comsigua separately, and will\u00a0refer to Tenaris and Talta, respectively, as the relevant Claimant.\n57. The Arbitral Tribunal will approach its analysis of the case as follows: it will\u00a0first examine the three jurisdictional objections asserted by Venezuela (V.); next,\u00a0it will address the Claimants' main claim, namely the alleged expropriation of their\u00a0investments by the Bolivarian Republic (VI.), and will make a decision on the\u00a0compensation quantum (VII.). Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal will render its award\u00a0on interest, taxes, and costs (VIII -X.) and will provide a summary of all previous\u00a0findings (XI.). The final section will contain the Award's decision (XII.).\n27\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 31 of 201\nV. OB.IECTIONS TO .IURISDICTION\n58. Venezuela has raised three objections to the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first one concerns a lack of consent (1.);\n- The second one, the lack of a corporate seat (2.); and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third and final one, defects in the notice of the dispute (3.)\n1. LACK OF CONSENT\n59. In investment arbitrations under a bilateral investment treaty, consent to arbitration is expressed successively: first, the State formalizes an offer to submit\u00a0to arbitration in the BIT; then, the investor accepts that offer - and such\u00a0acceptance may take any one of several forms. Once the investor has expressed\u00a0its acceptance, consent to arbitration has been perfected.\n60. Where the concerned State is Venezuela, the process whereby consent is perfected becomes complicated as a result of the fact that, on January 24, 2012,\u00a0Venezuela denounced the Convention.\n61. Denunciation of the Convention is governed by Articles 71 and 72:\n\"Article 71. Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall\u00a0take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\"\n\"Article 72. Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Article[. .1 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of\u00a0any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that\u00a0State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of\u00a0them before such notice was received by the depositary.\"\n62. Article 71 provides that a State's denunciation of the Convention does not take\u00a0effect until six months after receipt thereof by the World Bank; this rule means\u00a0that, until July 24, 2012 (six months after denunciation) the Convention\u00a0remained in full force and effect with respect to Venezuela. The Claimants filed\u00a0their Request for Arbitration on July 20, 2012 and, therefore, prior to the\u00a0expiration of such term.\n63. Moreover, Article 72 contains a specific rule since, in order for the Convention\u00a0to apply to a denouncing State, even within the six-month period mentioned in\u00a0Article 71, \"consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre\" must have been given prior\u00a0to the denunciation.\n64. There is a certain amount of debate as to whether \"consent to jurisdiction\" in\u00a0Article 72 of the Convention refers to the consent perfected by the State and the\u00a0investor (as argued by the Respondent) or rather it is to be read only as the\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 32 of 201\nState's unilateral offer to arbitrate. The Claimants contend that such debate is moot, since, inespective of the prefened interpretation, in any event they had\u00a0already validly given their consent prior to the Denunciation.27\n65. The issue to determine here is then whether the Claimants accepted the offer to\u00a0arbitrate made by Venezuela prior to its Denunciation. The case for each\u00a0Claimant and its investment will be addressed separately.\n1.1 TENARIS-TAVSA\nA. Venezuela's Position\n66. Venezuela raises two arguments to have this Tribunal decline its jurisdiction:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As its main argument, it maintains that acceptance of arbitration could\nhave taken place only after the pre -arbitration negotiation period (a.); and\n- In the alternative, it contends that consent to arbitration was never perfected due to the inconsistency between the terms of the offer and the\u00a0terms of the acceptance (b.)\na. Lack of Acceptance After the Required Negotiation\n67. Pursuant to Article 9.1 and 9.2 of the Luxembourg BIT:\n\"1. Any dispute between an investor and the other Contracting Party concerning the application of this Agreement shall be the subject of a\u00a0written notification, accompanied by a sufficiently detailed memorandum,\u00a0from the investor. As far as possible, the parties shall endeavor to settle the\u00a0dispute amicably by negotiation, where necessary seeking expert advice\u00a0from a third party by conciliation.\n2. In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the date of notification of dispute, the dispute shall be submitted, at the investor's\u00a0option, either to the competent jurisdiction of the State in which the\u00a0investment was made or to international arbitration. Once made, the choice\u00a0shall be final.\nTo this end, each Contracting Party shall give its irrevocable consent in advance to the submission of any dispute to such arbitration.\"\n68. The Respondent argues that Tenaris should have issued its acceptance at the end\u00a0of the six-month negotiation period, running as from the date of the notice of\u00a0dispute, provided, however, that it had engaged in good -faith negotiations with\u00a0Venezuela28 - which did not happen.\nb. Failure to Perfect Consent\n69. Venezuela also raises a subsidiary argument.\n27 CV, para. 145; T., p. 128:3-7.\n28 RIlI, para. 188.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 33 of 201\n70. On November 20, 2009, Tenaris sent the Ministry of the People's Power for\u00a0Energy and Oil ['MEP\"I notice of the existence of a dispute under the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT concerning the expropriation of its investment in Tavsa\u00a0['Tavsa Notice\"I.29 In such notice, Tenaris reserved its right to institute\u00a0arbitration proceedings upon the expiration of the six-month negotiation period\u00a0beginning on the date of the notice or earlier, insofar as the negotiations were\u00a0futile.3\u00b0\n71. According to the Bolivarian Republic, this reservation of rights causes the terms\u00a0of the acceptance to arbitration not to be identical to those of the offer to\u00a0arbitrate.31 And this inconsistency in their terms would mean that consent to\u00a0arbitration was not perfected,32 as such consent would be flawed.33\nB. Tenaris' Position\n72. Tenaris denies the validity of the two arguments put forth by Venezuela.\na. Prior Negotiations\n73. Following the Tavsa Notice, Tenaris claims to have repeatedly expressed to\u00a0Venezuela its desire to engage in negotiations, as evidenced by the discussions\u00a0and meetings that took place, as well as the conespondence sent over that\u00a0period.34\n74. The Claimant maintains that, by the time Venezuela submitted its Denunciation,\u00a0on January 24, 2012, Tenaris had more than observed the six-month negotiation\u00a0period.\nb. Perfected Consent\n75. Tenaris contends that the reservation in the Tavsa Notice merely reflects the\u00a0language of Article 9.1 of the Luxembourg BIT, which requires that the parties,\u00a0\"as far as possible,\" endeavor to amicably settle their dispute, as well as\u00a0extended arbitration practice, where it is established that negotiations need not\u00a0be continued in the event of \"futility.\"35\n76. The Claimant further argues that it was not until this arbitration that Venezuela\u00a0first brought the contents of the Tavsa Notice into question.36\nC. Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal\n29 Notice of Dispute from Tenaris to Venezuela, November 20, 2009, Exhibit C-9. Venezuela received such Notice on November 26, 2009; attached to the notice was a detailed memorandum of the dispute.\n\u00b0 Tavsa Notice, Exhibit C-9, pp. 4, 5.\n31 Venezuela refers to the following paragraph of the Tavsa Notice: \"In this context, Tenaris [.1 reservesI from now on itsI right to initiate an arbitration upon expiration of the six-month negotiations period following the date of this letter or\u00a0even earlier to the extent that the conduct of the Government determines the exhaustion of such period would constitute a\u00a0ritualism or formalism deprived of any usefulness.\" Exhibit C-9.\n32 RV, para. 40; T., p. 1593:5-7 (Reinisch).\nRill, para. 189.\nCV, para. 122.\n35T.,pp. 113:14-114:5; pp. 1658:18-1660:1.\n36CV para. 121.\n30\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 34 of 201\n77. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Tenaris on the two points at issue.\na. Prior Negotiations\n78. Venezuela initially argued that acceptance was to take place after negotiating in\u00a0good faith for six months, and that this requirement had not been satisfied here.\u00a0After the evidence produced by the Claimant, showing its contacts with\u00a0Venezuela through discussions, letters and meetings over the course of more\u00a0than two years, the Respondent seems to have dropped this argument in its later\u00a0pleadings.\n79. In any event, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Tenaris: the Claimant did fulfill\u00a0its duty to negotiate for six months before submitting the dispute to arbitration.\u00a0And it did repeatedly bring the dispute before the Government, expressing its\u00a0desire to reach an amicable settlement; so follows from the following evidence:\nThe letters of May 29, 2009, August 17, 2009,38 February 26, 2010, and May 3, 2010;\u00b0\nThe Tavsa Notice, of November 20, 2009;41\nThe meetings of March 25, 2010,42 April 27, 2010, May 27, 2010, February\n9, 2011, September 27, 2011,46 October 5, 2011, and November 29, 2011;\n80. The Bolivarian Republic has not disproven its opponent's evidence.\n81. The Tribunal finds that, when Venezuela denounced the Convention on January\u00a024, 2012, the six months of required conciliation attempts as from the Tavsa\u00a0Notice of November 20, 2009 had more than elapsed.\nb. Matching Terms\n82. Venezuela claims that, in the Tavsa Notice, Tenaris had changed the terms of\u00a0Venezuela's offer to submit to arbitration, thereby creating an inconsistency\u00a0between offer and acceptance that allegedly kept consent from being perfected.\n83. The argument is unconvincing.\nExhibit C-60.\n38 Exhibit C-70.\nIn the letter from Mr. Jos\u00e9 FrIas (Tenaris) to the Venezuelan Ministiy of the People's Power for Energy and Oil, addressed to the attention of Mr. Angel NiThez (PDVSA Industrial), of February 26, 2010, Tenaris invites PDVSA\u00a0Industrial to meet in order to go over the value of the compensation for its Tavsa shareholding. Exhibit C-191; Prosperi,\u00a0para. 13.\n\u00b0 In the letter from Mr. Jos\u00e9 FrIas (Tenaris) to the Venezuelan Ministiy of the People's Power for Energy and Oil, of May 3, 2010, the Claimants stated that in no way did the appointment of additional members to Tavsa's technical commission\u00a0entail a modification, alteration, or interruption of the negotiations period provided for in the Luxembourg BIT.

In executing the Luxembourg BIT, Venezuela gave its consent for the dispute to\u00a0be submitted to ICSID,48 subject (as per its claim) to one condition: that the six-month period for prior negotiations be observed.\n85. In the Tavsa Notice, Tenaris agreed to settle the dispute before ICSID:49\n\"The Luxembourg Treaty states the consent of the State of Venezuela to have any such dispute resolved by means of international arbitration, in\u00a0particular under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of\u00a0Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), which consent has also been hereby given\u00a0by Tenaris and Tavsa LLC to resort to arbitration in the unfortunate event\u00a0that the dispute cannot be amicably settled. 50\n86. The terms of the offer to arbitrate and the terms of Tenaris' acceptance are thus\u00a0perfectly consistent: Venezuela offered arbitration and Tenaris (and Tavsa) \"also\u00a0gave their consent to resort to arbitration.\"51\n48 Luxembourg BIT, Article 9.2 in fine and Article 9.3. Exhibit C-9, p. 5.\n\u00b0 Underlined by the Tribunal.\n51 The Tribunal is paraphrasing.\n32\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 36 of 201\nReservation of Rights\n87. However, Venezuela has focused on the final portion of the phrase following\u00a0Tenaris' consent, where Tenaris makes a reservation of rights:\n\"In this context, Tenaris and Tavsa LLC hereby reserve their right to institute arbitration once the period of six months from the date hereof has\u00a0expired, or even earlier to the extent that the Government's conduct causes\u00a0the exhaustion of such period to be a ritualism or formalistic requirement\u00a0devoid of any use.\" 52\n88. Does this reservation of rights change the above conclusion that consent had\u00a0been perfected?\n89. It should first be noted that Tenaris never resorted to such reservation since, de\u00a0facto, it did observe the six-month negotiation period.\n90. Even if it had not observed that period, however, the inclusion of the above\u00a0reservation would not have entailed a material modification of the offer, since,\u00a0by including its reservation, Tenaris merely adhered to an accepted principle of\u00a0investment arbitration, reflected in the Luxembourg BIT itself: negotiations are\u00a0to take place \"as far as possible,\"53 and, where any attempt at negotiating is\u00a0futile, this period need not be exhausted.54 It should be further noted that never\u00a0had the Bolivarian Republic - until the commencement of this arbitration -called Tenaris' attention to the discrepancy it is now bringing up, which\u00a0confirms that, in tempore insuspecto, Venezuela did not detect any inegularity in\u00a0the Tavsa Notice.\n91. To conclude, the Arbitral Tribunal rejects the first jurisdictional objection raised\u00a0against Tenaris: by the date of the Denunciation, Tenaris had accepted the terms\u00a0of Venezuela's offer to arbitrate, and had fulfilled its duty to negotiate for no less\u00a0than six months.\n1.2 TALTA-COMSIGUA\n92. As regards Comsigua, Venezuela argues that consent to arbitrate was subject to\u00a0one condition being satisfied: that Talta, the owner of the investment, negotiated\u00a0in good faith for six months. Consent could not be perfected before that period\u00a0ended.55\n93. For its part, Talta claims to have satisfied this requirement, because the Portuguese BIT provides that the six-month negotiation period runs as from the\u00a0first negotiation, which, in this case, took place in 2010.56\n94. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Talta.\n52 Underlined by the Tribunal.

The Portuguese BIT does not call for notification of the dispute, and it very\u00a0clearly establishes that the six-month period for negotiations runs as from the\u00a0commencement of the negotiations:57\n\"Should the dispute not be solved by amicable means within a period of six (6) months, counted from the beginning of these consultations, it may be\u00a0submitted, at the choice of the investor: [..j.\"58\n96. The timeline is as follows:\nTalta made its first request to negotiate on June 28, 2010;\nOne year and a half later, on December 2, 2011, Tenaris and Talta sent the Ministry of the People's Power for Industry ['MIBAM\"I a notice of the\u00a0existence of a dispute under the Luxembourg and Portuguese BITs with\u00a0respect to their investment in Comsigua ['Comsigua Notice\"I.6\u00b0 In this\u00a0Notice, Tenaris and Talta once again expressed their willingness to reach\u00a0an amicable settlement of the dispute and stated their consent to submit the\u00a0dispute to ICSID arbitration if no amicable solution was reached within the\u00a0time period prescribed in the BITs;61\nThe Denunciation took place on January 24, 2012, effective July 24, 2012.\nThe Request for Arbitration was filed on July 20, 2012.\n97. Pursuant to the Portuguese BIT, the six-month negotiation period runs from \"the\u00a0beginning of these consultations.\" The facts leave no room for doubt: when Talta\u00a0sent the Comsigua Notice, it had more than fulfilled its duty to negotiate for six\u00a0months (and, at the time, Venezuela had not yet denounced the Convention).\u00a0Accordingly, Talta did validly perfect its consent to arbitration when it sent the\u00a0Comsigua Notice on December 2, 2011, before the Denunciation.\n98. The Arbitral Tribunal could end its analysis here, after having verified that Talta,\u00a0which is the direct holder of Comsigua's shares, consented to arbitration in the\u00a0required time period and manner.\n99. However, the Tribunal is aware that the Claimants' petitum as regards Comsigua\u00a0is framed as compensation for the benefit of both Claimants (not just Talta),62\u00a0which requires that the Arbitral Tribunal also verify consent by Tenaris as a co -\nPortuguese BIT, Article VIII.2.\n58 Underlined by the Tribunal.\nProsperi, paras. 18-22; Villarroel II, para. 8.\n60 Venezuela received such Notice on December 5, 2011, and, as was the case with the Tavsa Notice, this Notice was also\u00a0accompanied by a detailed memorandum of the dispute.

The case of Tenaris, as an indirect owner of Comsigua, is more complex because\u00a0the Luxembourg BIT differs from the Portuguese BIT (discussed in the\u00a0preceding section).\n101. Article 9 of the Luxembourg BIT provides as follows:63\n\"1. Any dispute between an investor and the other Contracting Party concerning the application of this Agreement shall be the subject of a\u00a0written notification, accompanied by a sufficiently detailed memorandum,\u00a0from the investor. As far as possible, the parties shall endeavor to settle the\u00a0dispute amicably by negotiation, where necessary seeking expert advice\u00a0from a third party by conciliation.\n2. In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the date of notification of dispute, the dispute shall be submitted, at the investor's\u00a0option, either to the competent jurisdiction of the State in which the\u00a0investment was made or to international arbitration. Once made, the choice\u00a0shall be final.\"\n102. Pro memoria: Tenaris and Talta sent the Comsigua Notice on December 2, 2011.\u00a0The six-month period began (as required by the Luxembourg BIT) at the time of\u00a0the Comsigua Notice and, therefore, it ended on June 2, 2012. By then,\u00a0Venezuela had already denounced the Convention - its Denunciation took place\u00a0on January 24, 2012.\n103. Venezuela argues that consent to arbitration may not be perfected until the\u00a0required negotiation period has expired, and that Tenaris never actually got to\u00a0perfect consent to arbitration in connection with its investment in Comsigua.\n104. For its part, Tenaris argues the opposite, and claims that consent was perfected\u00a0by means of the Comsigua Notice, and that the negotiation period is merely a\u00a0procedural requirement: until said period expires, the investor is prevented from\u00a0filing a request for arbitration, but this waiting period does not affect the\u00a0perfecting of consent given prior to that.\n105. The Respondent and the Claimants have submitted expert opinions by two\u00a0investment arbitration experts, namely Professors August Reinisch and\u00a0Christoph Schreuer, respectively, who have provided their opinion in support of\u00a0each Party's position, which will be summarized next (A. and B.). Then, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal will reach a decision (C.).\nA. Venezuela's Position\n106. The Respondent has relied on the opinion of Prof. Reinisch.64\n63 Underlined by the Tribunal.\n64 Opinion of March 31, 2014 [\"Reinisch I\", and opinion of October 12, 2014 [\"Reinisch II\".\n35\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 39 of 201\n107. It is the expert's opinion that, once the Convention has been denounced, only\u00a0those rights and obligations which have already arisen from previously -perfected\u00a0mutual consent to ICSID arbitration escape the effects of such denunciation.\u00a0Consent is perfected when the investor accepts the State's arbitration offer.65\u00a0Because in this case the Denunciation took place on January 24, 2012, consent to\u00a0arbitration should have been perfected prior to such date.66\n108. Prof. Reinisch analyzes the two actions through which Tenaris might have\u00a0expressed its consent to arbitration: the Comsigua Notice and the Request for\u00a0Arbitration; he then concludes that neither one perfected consent.\nThe Comsigua Notice\n109. Prof. Reinisch acknowledges that, as a general principle, the investor can accept\u00a0an arbitration offer made by a State in a BIT at any time between that BIT's\u00a0effective date and the State's Denunciation of the Convention.67 The expert also\u00a0accepts that the Luxembourg BIT contains no provision establishing when\u00a0consent to arbitration is to be deemed perfected.68\n110. The above notwithstanding, in his opinion, in order for an acceptance of the\u00a0offer to arbitrate to be valid and cause consent to be perfected, it must satisfy all\u00a0of the requirements established in the offer itself.69 In this case, it is the expert's\u00a0opinion that the offer was conditional upon the satisfaction of one requirement:\u00a0the Luxembourg BIT requires that a six-month negotiation period be observed\u00a0after the notice before being able to choose an arbitration forum and submit the\u00a0dispute to arbitration.7\u00b0 The expert maintains that, had consent been perfected via\u00a0that notice, the investor would have been deprived of that right to elect a forum,\u00a0once the required negotiations had ended.71\n111. The expert reaches this conclusion by performing a literal interpretation of the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT,72 from which he concludes that acceptance of the arbitration\u00a0offer is subject to a process consisting of three successive steps:73\nFirst, a notice of a dispute;\nSecond, a mandatory six-month negotiation period;\nThird, the choice of submitting the dispute to either the appropriate courts of the State or international arbitration.\n112. For that reason, it is the expert's opinion that the consent to arbitration expressed\u00a0by Tenaris in the Comsigua Notice could not be perfected until the negotiation\n65 Reinisch I, para. 40.\n66 Reinisch I, paras. 46, 47.\n67 Reinisch II, para. 75.\n68 Reinisch II, para. 48.\n69 Reinisch II, para. 75.\n\u00b0 Reinisch I, para. 55.\n' Reinisch II, para. 69.\n72 Reinisch II, para. 52.

Because in this case Tenaris gave its consent to arbitration in the Comsigua\u00a0Notice and such consent would not be effectively perfected until six months\u00a0later, i.e. on June 2, 2012, Tenaris would be left without ICSID protection since,\u00a0by then, Venezuela had already denounced the Convention. 76\nThe Request for Arbitration\n114. Tenaris filed its Request for Arbitration on July 20, 2012, more than six months\u00a0after the Denunciation. The expert maintains that, had the Request perfected the\u00a0investor's consent, such perfecting would have taken place after the\u00a0Denunciation and would thus be ineffective.77\nB. Tenaris' Position\n115. The Claimant relies on the opinion of Prof. Schreuer.78\n116. According to this expert, there is an ongoing debate as to whether the negotiation\u00a0period is a jurisdictional requirement (because it affects consent) or a procedural\u00a0one (because it affects the admissibility of the complaint).79\n117. It is his view that, in this case, that discussion is moot: the debate is of\u00a0consequence where the investor has ignored the prior negotiations requirement\u00a0and skipped directly forward to arbitration.8\u00b0 Here, Tenaris has indeed observed\u00a0the negotiation period. According to Prof. Schreuer, where this is the case,\u00a0tribunals have found it unnecessary to rule on the legal nature of the requirement\u00a0to negotiate81.\n118. In any event, it is Prof. Schreuer's opinion that, even though it is true that\u00a0investors will often consent to arbitration in the request for arbitration, this does\u00a0not mean that an investor cannot do so any earlier. Were it to decide to accept\u00a0the State's offer at an earlier point in time, this would be the date on which\u00a0consent would have been perfected.82 Prof. Schreuer is not persuaded that the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT is intended to preserve, at all costs, the investor right to choose\u00a0the forum to which it will be submitting its complaint until after the six months\u00a0of negotiations. Even more so when such right would disappear upon the State\u00a0denouncing the Convention. 83\n119. The expert argues that Venezuela gave its consent to arbitration in the\nReinisch I, para. 55.\nReinisch I, para. 58.\n76 Reinisch I, para. 61.\nReinisch I, paras. 50, 51.\n78 Opinion of June 10, 2014 [\"Schreuer I\" and opinion of Januaiy 19, 2015 [\"Schreuer II\". Schreuer I, para. 28.\n80 Schreuer I, para. 29.\n81 Schreuer I, para. 30.\n82 Schreuer I, para. 32.\n83 Schreuer II, para. 37.\n37\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 41 of 201\nLuxembourg BIT and that such offer could be accepted by the investor at any time;84 the only thing that was subject to the observance of the negotiation period\u00a0was the possibility of instituting arbitration85 (the third step in Prof Reinisch's\u00a0terminology),86 such that, if the negotiations ended in a settlement, the arbitration\u00a0complaint could be avoided. 87\n120. In this case, Tenaris accepted the arbitration offer by sending the Comsigua\u00a0Notice on December 2, 2011, and it was then that consent to arbitration was\u00a0perfected. Accordingly, by the time Venezuela denounced the Convention on\u00a0January 24, 2012, consent had already been perfected. There is thus no obstacle\u00a0to the Centre's jurisdiction.88\n121. Prof. Schreuer brings up one final argument: demanding that consent be\u00a0perfected after the notice of dispute would do nothing but serve as an incentive\u00a0for States to avoid being sued and thus sidestep the obligations they undertook\u00a0upon executing the BIT by merely denouncing the Convention. 89\nC. The Arbitral Tribunal's Decision\n122. The jurisdiction of this Arbitral tribunal arises from the consent to ICSID\u00a0arbitration expressed by both the State and the investor. Such consent is\u00a0formalized via a two-phase process: the State first gives consent through the\u00a0offer contained in the BIT, and it is the investor who then accepts that offer. The\u00a0Parties are in disagreement as to whether the arbitration consent between the\u00a0Venezuelan State and Tenaris was perfected before or after the State denounced\u00a0the Convention.\nThe Bolivarian Republic\n123. Venezuela's consent is contained in Article 9.2 in fine of the Luxembourg BIT:\n\"To this end, each Contracting Party shall give its irrevocable consent in advance to the submission of any dispute to such arbitration.\"\n124. Even though the word \"otorgara\" seems to point to consent being given in the\u00a0future, the Parties have not brought into question the fact that, by ratifying the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT, Venezuela actually gave its consent;9\u00b0 therefore, the above -quoted provision should be read in the present tense (\"gives\"). This conclusion is\u00a0consistent with the French version of the Luxembourg BIT, which uses the term\u00a0\"donne\"91 (present tense). To avoid any doubts, it should be noted that, as per the\u00a0final provision, negotiations were canied out in French. 92\n84 Schreuer I, para. 50.\n85 Schreuerl,para. 51.\n86 Schreuer II, para. 38.\n87 Schreuer I, para. 50.\n88 Schreuer II, para. 95.\n89 Schreuer II, para. 42.\n\u00b0 CIII, para. 17; Rh, para. 26.\n91 Art. 9.2 Luxembourg BIT (French version): \"A cette fin, chacune des Parties contractantes donne son consentement anticip\u00e9 et irrevocable a cc que tout defferend soit soumis a cet arbitrage.\"\n92 Final provision of the Luxembourg BIT: \"Done in Brussels, on March 17, 1998, in three original copies, each one in the Spanish, French, and Dutch language, all three being equally authentic. In the event of discrepancies, there shall be taken\u00a0into consideration the fact that negotiations were canied out in French.\"\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 42 of 201\nT'ii cir '\n125. In its Comsigua Notice of December 2, 2011, Tenaris accepted the State's\u00a0arbitration offer and chose ICSID as the arbitration forum:93\n\"To this end, the Applicants hereby express their consent to submit the Dispute to an international arbitration tribunal of the International Centre for\u00a0Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), pursuant to Article 9 of the\u00a0Luxembourg Treaty [..1.\"\n126. Prima facie, consent to arbitration was perfected on December 2, 2011: there\u00a0was an offer by the State that was accepted by the investor, and such acceptance\u00a0took place prior to the Denunciation.\nArticle 9.2 of the Luxembourg BIT\n127. Prof. Reinisch, however, brings up a possible exception to this preliminary\u00a0conclusion, which he bases upon the initial phrase of Article 9.2 of the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT:\n\"2. In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the date of notification of dispute, the dispute shall be submitted, at the investor's\u00a0option, either to the competent jurisdiction of the State in which the\u00a0investment was made or to international arbitration. [..J.\"\n128. Both experts are in agreement that Article 9.2 sets a requirement: the investor\u00a0must negotiate for six months as from the date of notice prior to submitting the\u00a0dispute to the chosen forum ['Pre-Condition\"I.\n129. The experts disagree as to the moment when the investor may choose an\u00a0arbitration forum and thereby perfect consent to arbitration:\nAccording to Prof. Schreuer, the investor may opt at any moment, even before the Pre -Condition has been satisfied, because the Pre -Condition is\u00a0merely a requirement for the admissibility of the complaint; this applied to\u00a0the case at hand, it is Prof. Schreuer's opinion that the Comsigua Notice,\u00a0where Tenaris chose arbitration, amounted to the valid perfection of\u00a0consent to arbitration, as it took place prior to Denunciation.\nProf. Reinisch seems to acknowledge that Tenaris could not institute arbitration proceedings without first having attempted to negotiate for six\u00a0months; but, according to the expert,95 the Pre -Condition also affects\u00a0consent to arbitration, since the investor may not opt for arbitration until\u00a0the Pre -Condition has been met.96\n130. This is about interpreting Article 9.2 of the Luxembourg BIT. Any BIT\u00a0interpretation is governed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\nUnderlined by the Tribunal.\nSchreuer I, para. 95.\nReinisch II, para. 46.\n96 Reinisch II, para. 9(e).\n39\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 43 of 201\n['VCLT\"I, whose relevance is accepted by both Parties, as its contents represent a compilation of customary international Law;97 and, specifically, by Article 31\u00a0thereof.

The Arbitral Tribunal must interpret the disputed paragraph of Article 9.2 within\u00a0its context in the BIT.\nThe Requirements of Article 9\n132. Article 9 of the Luxembourg BIT lays down four requirements to be met by an\u00a0investor prior to filing a complaint:\nThat the investor give notice of the existence of the dispute in writing, in a sufficiently detailed memorandum:\n\"Any dispute between an investor and the other Contracting Party concerning the application of this Agreement shall be the subject of a\u00a0written notification, accompanied by a sufficiently detailed\u00a0memorandum, from the investor.\"\nThat the Parties attempt to amicably resolve the dispute through negotiations:\n\"As far as possible, the parties shall endeavor to settle the dispute amicably by negotiation, where necessary seeking expert advice from\u00a0a third party by conciliation.\"\nThat the investor chooses one of the two forums offered by the State - the ordinary jurisdiction of the host State or international arbitration - and that\u00a0such choice be final:\n\"the dispute shall be submitted, at the investor's option, either to the competent jurisdiction of the State in which the investment was made\u00a0or to international arbitration. Once made, the choice shall be final.\"\nThat the investor not submit the dispute to the chosen forum before six months of negotiations, as from the date of the notice of dispute:\n\"In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the date of notification of dispute, the dispute shall be submitted, at the\u00a0investor's option, either to the competent jurisdiction of the State in\u00a0which the investment was made or to international arbitration.\"\n133. Prof. Reinisch is right in his statement that Article 9 of the Luxembourg BIT\u00a0establishes the following iter:\nRemisch I, para. 24; M. Villiger, \"Commentaiy on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,\" (2009) 875; Tokios Tokel\u00e9s, para. 27; Noble Venture, para. 50; Mondev, para. 43.\n98 \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinaiy meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n40\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 44 of 201\n- First, notice of a dispute;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, negotiations for at least six months (the \"Pre -Condition\");\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, submission of the dispute to arbitration, at the investor's discretion,\nonce the Pre -Condition has been satisfied.\n134. It is also true, however, that Article 9 of the Luxembourg BIT simplistically\u00a0condenses into a mere three paragraphs a reality that is usually much more\u00a0complex. And this was indeed so in the case at hand:\nThe State did not first hear about the dispute upon receiving the Comsigua Notice in December 2011; in fact, Venezuela had already created a\u00a0commission to negotiate the compensation owed to the Claimants back in\u00a0October 2009, and such negotiations had extended for the two years up to\u00a0the Notice.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Comsigua Notice, the investor did not just give its express consent,\nbut it also exercised its option choosing ICSID arbitration.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the Notice, negotiations extended for over six more months.100\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that period, the investor filed the Request for Arbitration before its\nchosen forum.\n135. Reality does not then track the normal iter provided for in Article 9 of the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT. In the Comsigua Notice, Tenaris did not just give consent, but\u00a0it also chose arbitration; and the question is then whether such was a valid choice\u00a0or, on the contrary, the BIT only allows consent to be perfected and the choice\u00a0made after the Pre -Condition has been satisfied.\nThe Conect Interpretation of Article 9.2\n136. Article 9.2 of the BIT provides that, following the required notice that a dispute\u00a0has arisen, a six-month period needs to elapse before the investor is allowed to\u00a0submit the dispute to its forum of choice (\"In the absence of an amicable\u00a0settlement within six months from the date of notification of dispute, the dispute\u00a0shall be submitted, at the investor's option, to the courts or arbitrationi\").\u00a0However, the BIT does not include a prohibition keeping the investor from\u00a0expressing its consent and choosing arbitration at the same time it gives notice of\u00a0the dispute. There is no indication either that the negotiations are to be\u00a0considered a condition precedent for consent to be effective. It is therefore\u00a0preferable to read, by interpreting the BIT in its context, the investor as being\u00a0authorized to simultaneously express its three statements of intention (notify the\u00a0dispute, express its pure consent and choose ICSID arbitration).\n137. Moreover, this interpretation is the only one that gives full meaning to the final\u00a0phrase of Article 9.2: \"once made, the choice shall be final.\" The phrase seems\nExhibit R-46.\n100 See para. 96 supra.\n41\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 45 of 201\nto refer to an investor who decides to exercise its choice in advance, at the same time as it gives notice of the dispute: only in this case of advance exercise of the\u00a0choice is it necessary for the provision to specify that the decision will be final.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0Object and Purpose\n138. The second interpretation criterion proposed by Article 31 of the VCLT means\u00a0that, when interpreting a treaty, the reading that is most consistent with the\u00a0object and purpose the States had in mind when approving the treaty should\u00a0prevail.\n139. Article 9 is intended to give investors a choice between two forums: the\u00a0jurisdiction of the host State or international arbitration. The interpretation the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic advocates for would mean that the investor could only make\u00a0that choice and express its consent after giving notice of the existence of a\u00a0dispute and negotiating for a period of six months - but not any earlier. Such an\u00a0interpretation would hinder negotiations and foster surprising behavior: the State\u00a0would be in the dark as to which forum has been selected by the investor until it\u00a0is served with a complaint. On the other hand, the contrary interpretation serves\u00a0the purpose of notifying the State of the selected forum and paving the way for\u00a0subsequent negotiations.\nc. Good Faith\n140. The third interpretation criterion gives prevalence to that treaty interpretation\u00a0which best fits the requirements of good faith.\n141. The reading favored by Venezuela would postpone perfection of consent and\u00a0incentivize the States' unfair behavior: it would allow them to, once they have\u00a0been notified of a dispute and aware that the investor intends to submit the\u00a0dispute to ICSID arbitration, denounce the Convention for the sole purpose of\u00a0escaping their obligations.\n142. This last interpretation criterion also favors the treaty interpretation advocated\u00a0for by the Claimants.\n143. To conclude: by approving the Luxembourg BIT, the Bolivarian Republic\u00a0expressed its \"irrevocable consent in advance\" to submit disputes with protected\u00a0investors to international arbitration (including ICSID arbitration), provided,\u00a0however, that such investors accepted the offer and chose arbitration. In the\u00a0event of a dispute between an investor and Venezuela, Article 9 of the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT (when conectly interpreted) allows the investor to express its\u00a0consent in advance and, at the same time, opt for ICSID arbitration.\n144. On December 2, 2011, Tenaris sent Venezuela the Comsigua Notice, notifying it\u00a0of the existence of a dispute, stating its consent to submit the dispute to\u00a0arbitration, and choosing ICSID arbitration. This course of action was in line\u00a0with Article 9 of the Luxembourg BIT and perfected the parties' intention to\u00a0resolve their dispute through ICSID arbitration. Because the Notice predates the\n42\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 46 of 201\nDenunciation, which took place on January 24, 2012, consent was validly perfected before Venezuela decided to withdraw from the Treaty. After the\u00a0Notice, Tenaris fulfilled its obligation to engage in negotiations for at least six\u00a0months, and filed its Request for Arbitration once such period had expired.\nD. Coda\n145. The experts for both Parties have cited many decisions discussing the pre -requirements to be satisfied by an investor prior to instituting arbitration\u00a0proceedings. The issue debated in those decisions is whether their satisfaction is\u00a0set up as an essential obligation the nonfulfillment of which entails the tribunal's\u00a0lack of jurisdiction or, rather, it is framed as a mere procedural requirement that\u00a0may be skipped by the investor.101\n146. The decisions in question are actually inelevant because they do not address the\u00a0issue that is fundamental in the case at hand: what is the effect of the\u00a0Convention's denunciation during the negotiation period, when the investor, in\u00a0notifying the dispute, had already given consent and exercised its choice, and,\u00a0later on, observes the mandatory negotiation period and waits until it has expired\u00a0to institute arbitration proceedings.\n147. The above notwithstanding, for the sake of an exhaustive discussion, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal will analyze the main cases relied upon by the Respondent, which\u00a0allegedly support its position that the State's consent to arbitration is subject to\u00a0the observance of the negotiation period provided for in the treaty:102\n148. (i) The Respondent relies on two decisions (Kilic and Dede), according to which\u00a0the State's offer to arbitrate is conditional. In fact, they both refer to the\u00a0requirement that, prior to filing an arbitration complaint, the investor exhaust its\u00a0local remedies;103 this conclusion cannot be extended to the prior negotiations\u00a0requirement, as there are significant differences between the two: local courts are\u00a0a forum alternative to and exclusive of arbitration, and it is understandable that a\u00a0State should wish to ensure that its courts have been given a chance to resolve\u00a0the dispute before giving its consent to international arbitration.\n149. (ii) The other two cases relied upon, which do indeed address the prior negotiations requirement (Murphy and Burlington), only mention that this\u00a0requirement is not a procedural rule that may be sidestepped by the investor but,\u00a0rather, it is an essential requirement that the claimant needs to satisfy before\u00a0being allowed to file a request for arbitration with ICSID;104 both decisions are\n101 By all, Murphy, para. 149.\n102 Reinisch I, paras. 56 et seq.\n103 Kzlz\u00e7, para. 6.1.4. Dede, paras. 176, 188.\n104 Murphy, para. 149: \"This Tribunal finds the requirement that the parties should seek to resolve their dispute through\u00a0consultation and negotiation for a six-month period does not constitute, as Claimant and some arbitral tribunals have\u00a0stated, \"a procedural rule\" or a \"directory and procedural\" rule which can or cannot be satisfied by the concerned\u00a0party. To the contrary, it constitutes a fundamental requirement that Claimant must comply with, compulsorily, before\u00a0submitting a request for arbitration under the ICSID rules.\" Burlington, para. 49: \"f..] the requirement that the parties\u00a0should seek for a six-month period does not constitute, as Claimant and some arbitral tribunals have stated, 'a procedural\u00a0rule' or a 'directory and procedural' rule which can or cannot be satisfied by the concerned party. To the contrary, it\u00a0constitutes a fundamental requirement that Claimant must comply with, compulsorily, before submitting a request for\u00a0arbitration under the ICSID rules.\"\n43\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 47 of 201\nentirely inelevant to the case at hand, where the investor did observe the six months of prior negotiations before instituting arbitration proceedings.\n150. (iii) Lastly, Venezuela brings up a case (Tulip) where the tribunal finds that prior\u00a0negotiations are an essential element of the Respondent State's consent to\u00a0arbitration, and that observance of the negotiation period is a \"pre -condition to\u00a0the jurisdiction\" of the tribunal.105\n151. Even assuming that the interpretation in Tulip is the conect interpretation, it\u00a0would lead to a conclusion that the Bolivarian Republic only agreed to submit\u00a0disputes to arbitration subject to the condition precedent that, after notice of the\u00a0dispute, the investor had negotiated for a period of six months. What the Tulip\u00a0decision fails to address, however, is whether, if the condition precedent is\u00a0satisfied (as was the case here, since the investor filed its request for arbitration\u00a0once the negotiation period had expired), such fulfillment has ex tunc effects\u00a0and, therefore, the effects of the State's consent should be deemed to apply as\u00a0from the date it was originally given. Because this issue was not addressed in\u00a0Tulip, that decision is not relevant to the instant case.\n105 Tulip, para. 72: \"a pre -condition to the jun sdiction of this Tribunal.\"\n44\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 48 of 201\n2. LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE SEAT\n152. In order for a legal entity to qualify as an investor, the BITs impose certain\u00a0requirements as to the location of its seat. Venezuela's second jurisdictional\u00a0objection is that neither Tenaris nor Talta satisfy these requirements.\n153. The issue is whether the BITs merely require that the investor have its\u00a0\"Statutory Seat\" (meaning that its bylaws merely mention that the company's\u00a0seat is in Luxembourg or Portugal) or they also require that it have its \"Effective\u00a0Seat\" there (i.e. that its corporate organs de facto manage the company's\u00a0business from the tenitory of Luxembourg or Portugal):\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the Respondent's view that the BITs require an Effective Seat; it\nmaintains that both companies have their effective seat in Argentina;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the Claimants argue that their Effective Seat is the same\nas their Statutory Seat and, in any event, it is located in Luxembourg and Portugal.\n154. Article 1(b) of the Luxembourg BIT provides as follows:106\n\"The term \"investors\" means:\n[.1 b) companies, that is to say, any legal entity organized in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Venezuela, the Kingdom of Belgium or the\u00a0Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and having its seat in the territory of the\u00a0Republic of Venezuela, the Kingdom of Belgium or the Grand Duchy of\u00a0Luxembourg, respectively [..1.\"\n155. The case with the Portuguese BIT is similar. Article I(1)(b) reads:107\n\"The term 'investor' means:\n[.1 b) Legal entities, including commercial companies and other companies and associations that have their seat in one of the Contracting\u00a0Parties and are organized and operate in accordance with the law of that\u00a0Contracting Party.\"\n2\n2.1 THE PARTIES' POSITION\n156. The parties have submitted reports by experts in both Luxembourg Law and\u00a0Portuguese Law regarding the subject of the seat:\nFor Luxembourg Law, Tenaris has submitted a legal opinion by Prof. Andr\u00e9 PrUm, of the University of Luxembourg,108 and the Bolivarian\u00a0Republic has requested Prof. Alain Steichen, also of the University of\u00a0Luxembourg, to prepare two legal opinions;109\n106 Underlined by the Tribunal.\u00a0'\u00b0 Underlined by the Tribunal.\n108 Opinion of Januaiy 23, 2015 [\"Prum\"I, para. 1.\n109 Opinion of October 17,2014 [\"Steichen I\"I, and opinion of April 13, 2015 [\"Steichen II'i.\n45\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 49 of 201\nFor Portuguese Law, the Claimants' expert is Prof. D\u00e1rio Moura Vicente, of the University of Lisbon,11\u00b0 and the Respondent has submitted two\u00a0opinions, by Profs. Pedro Maia and Tiago Duarte, of the University of\u00a0Coimbra and the New University of Lisbon, respectively.111\nVenezuela's Position\n157. According to Venezuela and its expert's opinion, the term \"sede social\" in\u00a0Spanish or \"siege social\" in French should be interpreted in accordance with\u00a0domestic Law. As per the Law of Luxembourg, sede social is to be an Effective\u00a0Seat (or real seat)112 and it conesponds with the central administration of the\u00a0company13 And, as per Portuguese Law, \"sede\" conesponds with the Effective\u00a0Seat, which is the place where the \"brains\" of the company are located.114\n158. The Respondent contends that Tenaris has failed to establish that, on the date\u00a0when the dispute arose - November 2009 - it had its Effective Seat in\u00a0Luxembourg,115 which would disqualify it as a protected investor under the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT; and that Talta has also failed to establish that it had its\u00a0Effective Seat in Portugal,116 and it would thus not be a protected investor under\u00a0the Portuguese BIT.117\n159. In Venezuela's opinion, the Effective Seat, or real seat, of Tenaris is located in\u00a0Argentina:118\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A quick Internet search reveals that Tenaris is the holding company for the\nItalian -Argentine Techint group, which is managed from Argentina;119\n- Several directors of Tenaris reside in Argentina, and it is thus impossible for them to be making actual shareholder and Board decisions from\u00a0120\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Argentine Republic espoused Tenaris' interests in an anti -dumping case\nbefore the WTO.121\n160. Talta is also alleged to have its Effective Seat in Argentina, as it is there that\u00a0several of its board members reside.122\nThe Claimants' Position\n110 Opinion of Januaiy 27, 2015 [\"Moura Vicente\"I, para. 3.\nOpinion of October 17,2014 [\"Maia/Duarte I\", and opinion of April 13, 2015 [\"Maia/Duarte II\".\n112 RV, para. 56; T., p. 1275:3-9.\n113 RIV, para. 196.

Venezuela's argument that the term \"siege social\" or \"sede\" is to be interpreted\u00a0in the light of domestic Law is, in the Claimants' opinion, entirely nonsensical.\u00a0Because the terms are found in BITs, they are to be interpreted under\u00a0international Law and the rules of the VCLT.123 This interpretation leads to the\u00a0conclusion that \"siege social\" and \"sede\" are synonymous with \"Statutory Seat\"\u00a0or \"registered office.\"124 According to the articles of association of Tenaris and\u00a0Talta, such seat is located in the cities of Luxembourg125 and Funchal,126\u00a0respectively.\n162. But, even agreeing that the seat requirement is to be interpreted in the light of\u00a0domestic Law, the answer would be the same:\n163. (i) Under Luxembourg Law, \"siege social\" is equal to real seat, which is iuris\u00a0tantum presumed to be the registered office, or Statutory Seat.127 It is thus up to\u00a0Venezuela to knock this presumption down and establish that Tenaris' effective\u00a0seat is located elsewhere - which it has not managed to do because the real or\u00a0Effective Seat of Tenaris is in Luxembourg:\nThe only office Tenaris has anywhere in the world is a 905m2 floor space at 29 on Avenue de la Porte-Neuve in Luxembourg,128 as stated on Tenaris'\u00a0official website;129\n123 T., p. 141:11-12; CIV, paras. 129, 155; CV, para. 148.

(ii) Under Portuguese Law, seat means \"Effective Seat,\" which is the Statutory\u00a0Seat, unless otherwise proven.132 Venezuela has not established that Talta has its\u00a0Effective Seat outside of Portugal, since, as a matter of fact, all relevant factors\u00a0to determine its Effective Seat point to Portugal:133\n- Its managing bodies meet in Portugal;\n- Its ordinary day-to-day management takes place in Portugal;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talta's contact data as provided by it to third parties feature Portugal;\n- Talta's corporate books are kept in Portugal.\n2.2 DEcIsIoN OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\n165. In order for an ICSID tribunal to have ratione personae jurisdiction, it is\u00a0necessary for the requirements laid down in Article 25 of the Convention and\u00a0those established in the relevant BIT to be cumulatively satisfied. In the words of\u00a0the Phoenix tribunal:134\n\"At the outset, it should be noted that BITs, which are bilateral arrangements between two States parties, cannot contradict the definition of\u00a0the ICSID Convention. In other words, they can confirm the ICSID notion\u00a0or restrict it, but they cannot expand it in order to have access to ICSID. A\u00a0definition included in a BIT being based on a test agreed between two States\u00a0cannot set aside the definition of the ICSID Convention, which is a\u00a0multilateral agreement. As long as it fits within the ICSID notion, the BIT\u00a0definition is acceptable, it is not f it falls outside of such definition.\"\nThe ICSID Convention\n166. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention governs the jurisdiction of the Centre and\u00a0provides as follows:\n\"(1) The jrnisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [.1 and a\u00a0national of another Contracting State [.1.\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n130 Minutes of Tenaris S.A.'s Ordinaiy Board of Directors Meeting, Exhibit C-193; Minutes of Tenaris S.A.'s Annual\u00a0Shareholders' Meeting, Exhibit C-196; T., pp. 503:14-504:15; 218:13-19; Exhibit C-208, T., pp. 2150:18-2150:20;\u00a02152-2153; 2054:1-2054:20.\n131 Extract of the Luxembourg Registry of Commerce and Corporations for Tenaris, May 23, 2012, Exhibit C-6, p. 5;\u00a0Minutes of Tenaris S.A.'s Annual Shareholders' Meeting, Exhibit C-196, pp. 6-7.\n132 Decision of the Court of Appeals of Porto, March 25, 2010, DMV-22.\n133 CIV, paras. 189, 191; RV, paras. 161-163; CV, p. 379.\u00a0'34Phoenix, para. 96.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 52 of 201\n(b) Any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties\u00a0consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration [..1.\n167. This provision thus bases the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals on a nationality test:\u00a0where the investor is a legal entity, as is the case here, its nationality needs to be\u00a0different from that of the respondent State.135 States are free to add additional\u00a0requirements (not, however, to impose lesser requirements). The Convention\u00a0thus uses nationality as a jurisdiction attribution factor.\n168. In the instant case, neither Party has brought into question the fact that Tenaris\u00a0and Talta have a nationality different from that of the Respondent and that Article\u00a025 of the Convention has thus been complied with.\nThe BITs\n169. Each of the BITs includes rules that are relevant to establish the Tribunal's ratione\u00a0personae jurisdiction:\n170. Article 1(b) of the Luxembourg BIT provides:\n\"The term 'investors' means: [..J\nb) companies, that is to say, any legal entity organized in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Venezuela, the Kingdom of Belgium or the\u00a0Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and having its seat in the territory of the\u00a0Republic of Venezuela, the Kingdom of Belgium or the Grand Duchy of\u00a0Luxembourg, respectively [.1.\"\n171. And Article I(1)(b) of the Portuguese BIT confirms:\n\"The term 'investor' means: [..J\nb) Legal entities, including commercial companies and other companies and associations that have their seat in one of the Contracting Parties and are\u00a0organized and operate in accordance with the law of that Contracting Party.\"\n172. The Parties are in disagreement as to whether the BITS merely require that the\u00a0investor companies have their Statutory Seat in Luxembourg or Portugal (a legal\u00a0requirement: the mere mention in the bylaws that the company's domicile is in\u00a0that country, which is very clearly satisfied) or that they have their Effective Seat\u00a0there (a factual requirement: the company's organs must manage the company's\u00a0business from the tenitory of Luxembourg or Portugal):\nIt is the Respondent's view that the BITs require an Effective Seat, and it argues that both companies have theirs in Argentina (not Luxembourg or\u00a0Portugal);136\nOn the other hand, the Claimants argue that their Effective Seat matches\n135 With the exception, pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) in fine, that the contracting parties have extended jurisdiction to legal entities subject to \"foreign control.\"\n136 RIV, paras. 231, 234.\n49\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 53 of 201\ntheir Statutory Seat and, in any event, they are located in Luxembourg and Portugal. 137\n173. From a theoretical standpoint, the Tribunal will side with the Bolivarian\u00a0Republic: it will anive at the conclusion that the BITs require that the\u00a0companies' Effective Seat (rather than just their Statutory Seat) be located in\u00a0Luxembourg or Portugal (A.).\n174. This theoretical conclusion having been established, the Tribunal will next\u00a0analyze and assess the evidence provided by the Parties, and will find for the\u00a0Claimants: Tenaris and Talta actually have their respective Effective Seats in\u00a0Luxembourg and Portugal, as required by the applicable rules (B. -E.).\nA. The BITs require an Effective Seat\n175. The BITs use terms different from those used in Article 25 of the Convention:\u00a0instead of refening to different nationalities, they focus on the cumulative\u00a0satisfaction of two requirements:\nThe Luxembourg BIT requires that the claimant be a legal entity \"organized in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of\u00a0Luxembourg\" and \"having its seat in the territory of the Grand Duchy of\u00a0Luxembourg\"; while\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Portuguese BIT requires (in virtually identical terms) that the claimant\nbe \"organized and operate in accordance with the Law\" of Portugal and \"have its seat\" in Portugal.\nThe Organization Requirement\n176. The first requirement is then that the claimant companies \"be organized\" in\u00a0accordance with the domestic law.138\n177. Neither Party has questioned that Tenaris is organized in accordance with the\u00a0law of Luxembourg, and Talta is organized in accordance with the law of\u00a0Portugal. The requirement is then considered satisfied.\nThe Seat Requirement\n178. However, the BITs do not just require that the Claimants be organized in\u00a0accordance with the domestic Law; they add, expressis verbis, a second\u00a0requirement: that the \"sede\" of the legal entity be located in Portugal or\u00a0Luxembourg.\n179. Tenaris' bylaws state that the company's \"siege social\" is located in Luxembourg,\u00a0and Talta's state that its sede social is located in Funchal. The respective\u00a0provisions read:\n' CIV, paras. 126 et seq.\n138 The Portuguese BIT adds \"and operate,\" but this additional specification is redundant, as a company's operation is governed by the same legal system as its organization.\n50\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 54 of 201\n\"Le siege social est \u00e9tabli a Luxernbourg-Ville.\"39\n\"A sociedade tern a sede social na Rua da Alf\u00e2ndega, narnero setenta e quarto setenta e seis, segundo andar, sala H, freguesia da Se, concelho do Funchal.\"14\u00b0\n180. However, the BITs require that the \"seat\" be located in Portugal or Luxembourg,\u00a0which brings up the question whether the Treaty is refening to the Statutory Seat\u00a0or the Effective Seat (b.). Before delving into this question, however, it is first\u00a0necessary to clarify the concepts of \"seat, \"Statutory Seat,\" and \"Effective Seat\"\u00a0under international Law (a.).\na. \"Seat,\" \"Statutory Seat,\" and \"Effective Seat\" under International Law\n181. International Law does not have its own concept of \"seat,\" let alone \"Statutory\u00a0Seat\" or \"Effective Seat.\" This terminology was developed within the various\u00a0domestic Law systems, and it was only later on that it was brought into the realm\u00a0of international Law. Therefore, in order to give the term some content, we need\u00a0to resort to the generally -accepted rules under the different domestic legal\u00a0systems (in the words of the International Court of Justice in Barcelona\u00a0Traction)141 or the \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\"\u00a0(which are a source of international law under Article 38 of the Statute of the\u00a0International Court of Justice).\n182. In the Tribunal's opinion, these rules are not overly broad and come down to:\nThe acknowledgment that there really is a difference between Statutory Seat and Effective Seat; domestic law systems generally distinguish the\u00a0two concepts, even though they do not always attribute the same legal\u00a0consequences to the existence of either one or the other type of Seat within\u00a0their tenitory;\n139 Exhibit C-197.\n140 Exhibit C-186.\n141 Barcelona Traction, para. 50: \"It is to rules generally accepted by municipal legal systems which recognize the limited\u00a0company whose capital is represented by shares, and not to the municipal law of a particular State, that international law\u00a0refers.\"\n51\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 55 of 201\nThe principle that, upon a company being organized, only its Statutory seat is known, as it is the one stated on the company's bylaws (since the\u00a0company will not yet have started its business operations from its Effective\u00a0Seat), and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conclusion that the Effective Seat matches the place where, in factual\nterms, the company's administration takes place.142\nb. The Correct Interpretation of the BITs\n183. The BITs refer to \"seat,\" without specifying whether this means the investor's\u00a0Statutory Seat or its Effective Seat.\n184. The practice when it comes to this issue in international investment treaties is\u00a0varied. Certain treaties only require that the company that expects to enjoy the\u00a0treaty's protection have been organized in accordance with the law of their\u00a0national State. 143 On the contrary, other treaties establish additional\u00a0requirements. An extreme case, for instance, is Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty\u00a0between Switzerland and the Slovak Republic,144 which adds a two -fold\u00a0requirement:\n\"legal entities f..] which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with real\u00a0economic activities, in the territory of that same Contracting Party.\"\n185. The BITs between the Bolivarian Republic and Luxembourg and Portugal,\u00a0respectively, take a middle-of-the-road position: they do not merely require that\u00a0the companies be organized in accordance with domestic Law, but also require\u00a0that the companies have their \"seat\" in that State. How is the concept of \"seat\" to\u00a0be interpreted?\n186. The BITs are international treaties and are to be interpreted in accordance with\u00a0the rules of international Law. Moreover, the BITs do not include a renvoi for\u00a0the terms \"sede\" and \"siege social\" (as opposed to the organization\u00a0requirement), which reinforces the conclusion that the applicable interpretation\u00a0criteria should be those of international Law.\n187. Article 31 of the VCLT orders that a treaty\n\"be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object\u00a0and prnpose.\"\n188. The VCLT establishes three interpretation criteria:\n142 UNCTAD Series on issues in International Investment agreements, UNCTADIITEIIIT/1 1 (Vol. II), 1999, RLA 5 p. 39:\u00a0\"The seat of a company may not be as easy to determine as the country of organization, but it does reflect a more\u00a0significant economic relationship between the company and the country of nationality. Generally speaking, \"seat of a\u00a0company\" connotes the place where effective management takes place.\"\n143 For instance, the BITs signed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela with the United Kingdom, of August 1, 1996\u00a0(Article 1(d)); with Canada, of July 1, 1996 (Article 1(g)), with Italy, of June 1990 (Article 1(2)(b)), among others.\n144 Which was the basis for the Alps Finance case, mentioned by the parties.\n52\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 56 of 201\nThe ordinary meaning of terms: the first interpretation criterion set forth in this provision is of little use here, since the concept of \"seat\" has several\u00a0ordinary meanings, including, precisely, those of Statutory Seat and\u00a0Effective Seat.\nContext: the \"seat\" requirement is preceded by a previous requirement, i.e. the \"organization\" requirement; a company intending to secure the BIT's\u00a0protection must not just be organized in accordance with the relevant\u00a0domestic Law but also have its seat in that State. The \"seat\" requirement is\u00a0to be interpreted having regard to the fact that it is included in addition to\u00a0the \"organization\" requirement.\nObject and purpose: this principle is closely connected to the effet utile principle,145 the interpretation principle that requires that priority be given\u00a0to that interpretation which gives meaning to each of the words used in the\u00a0treaty over any other interpretation that would leave a word without\u00a0application.146\n189. Applying the last two interpretation principles, and in the light of the rules of\u00a0international Law on the concept of seat - set out above, the necessary\u00a0conclusion is that the concept of \"seat\" in the BITs cannot just refer to the\u00a0Statutory Seat, in a formal sense, but must refer to the Effective Seat, the place\u00a0where the company's corporate activity is really centralized. A failure to adopt\u00a0this interpretation would render the BITs' requirement of a \"seat\" in addition to\u00a0the place of \"organization\" superfluous: any company organized in Luxembourg\u00a0or Portugal is legally required to have their bylaws state that its Statutory Seat is\u00a0located in the respective tenitory. It is only by reading the BITs as refening the\u00a0Effective Seat of the investor company that the term \"seat\" has its own meaning.\n190. To sum up, the Tribunal concludes that, inespective of the terminology used and\u00a0the inaccuracies in the translation of these concepts, the references to \"sede\" (or\u00a0\"siege social\") in the BITs are to be read as references to the Effective Seats of\u00a0the investor companies, the places where their corporate business is de facto\u00a0managed.\n145 Which requires that Treaties be interpreted \"so as to give them their fullest weight and effect consistent with the normal\u00a0sense of the words and with other parts of the text and in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to\u00a0every part of the text.\" Gardmer: Treaty Interpretation, Oxford University 2008, p. 149.\n146 Cassese, A.: International Law, Oxford University 2002, p. 143.\n53\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 57 of 201\nB. Effective Seat Determining Factors\n191. The conclusion that the reference to a \"seat\" in the BITs is a reference to their\u00a0Effective Seat having been established, there is still the quaestio vexata to be\u00a0answered: what does Effective Seat mean?\n192. As already noted, international Law does not have its own concept of \"Effective\u00a0Seat.\" To give the term content, it is not the domestic Law of a given jurisdiction\u00a0that must be resorted to but the generally -accepted rules under the various\u00a0municipal legal systems that must be used.147 To do this, the Tribunal must\u00a0recognize special relevance to the municipal legal systems that are more closely\u00a0related to the case at hand: Luxembourg and Portuguese Law.\n193. The experts in Luxembourg and Portuguese Law brought in by both Parties are\u00a0in agreement that there are three factors in the two legal systems that define a\u00a0company's Effective Seat:148\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The place where shareholder meetings and board meetings are canied\nout;149 the place where they are held is relevant;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The place where management tasks take place, the place where the\ncompany has contact with its clients,150 where it signs its main contracts, and where its financial activities are canied out;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The place where the company's books are kept and deposited;\n194. Next, the Arbitral Tribunal will analyze the evidence produced by each Party in\u00a0support of the Effective Seat of each Claimant.\nC. Ihe Claimants' Evidence\n195. The Claimants have produced the following evidence to establish that the\u00a0Effective Seats of Tenaris and Talta are located in Luxembourg and Portugal,\u00a0respectively:\na. Meeting of Management Organs\n196. As per Tenaris' bylaws, its annual shareholders' meeting is to be held in\u00a0Luxembourg.151 It has been established that, at the time Tenaris consented to\u00a0arbitration, in 2009, and filed its Request for Arbitration, in 2012, Tenaris held\u00a0its annual shareholders' meeting in Luxembourg, which is also its registered\u00a0office, and it was also there that all meetings were held in the interim period.152\n147 See para. 181 supra.\n148 Steichen I, para. 21; Prtim, para. 44.\n149 Moura Vicente, para. 21.\n150 MaialDuarte I, para. 121.\n151 Exhibit C-197, Article 15.\n152 CVI, Annex D.\n54\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 58 of 201\n197. As to Talta, it has filed minutes and extracts of decisions made at the meetings of\u00a0its sole member (Tenaris), all of them held at its statutory seat in Madeira.153\n198. As regards Board meetings, between 2009 and 2012, Tenaris has established\u00a0that:\n22 meetings154 were held by telephone, as allowed under the law of Luxembourg, pursuant to which they are deemed to have been held in\u00a0Luxembourg, its statutory seat;155\n14 meetings156 were held in person, eight of which were held in Luxembourg, with the remainder held in Mexico, Argentina, the U.S. or\u00a0Italy - which, as explained by the Claimants, were the countries were\u00a0Tenaris' stock was listed and where most of its subsidiaries' business was\u00a0concentrated. 157\n199. Talta has also submitted minutes of the meetings of its Conseiho de Ger\u00eancia,\u00a0always held in Madeira.158\nb. Place of Business Management\n200. As per the lease agreements, between 2004 and 2011, Tenaris leased office space\u00a0in a business center on Avenue John F. Kennedy, Luxembourg;159 since then, it\u00a0has rented (and shares with another four subsidiaries) a 905 m2 office space on\u00a0Avenue de la Porte Neuve, in the City of Luxembourg, for close to EUR 34,000\u00a0in monthly rent.16\u00b0 Tenaris has stated it has no other office, other than its\u00a0Luxembourg office, anywhere in the world.161\n201. Talta has also demonstrated it leases space office162 with the right to use a\u00a0meeting room163 for a monthly sum of EUR 875. It has also established that, of\u00a0its four managers, two reside in Portugal and that binding Talta requires the\u00a0signature of two managers, with at least one of them being Portuguese. 164\n153\n154\n155\n156 '\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n  \nCVI, Annex B.

The letterhead on Tenaris' letters165 and its website166 use the statutory seat as\u00a0contact information; the same is true of Talta.167\nc. Book -Keeping\n203. Tenaris is on record with the Registry of Commerce of Luxembourg,168 and its\u00a0accounts are audited by PwC in Luxembourg.169 Talta is registered with the\u00a0Registro Mercantil da Zona Franca de Made ira, and the certificate issued by\u00a0said registry's Escritur\u00e1rio Superior de la Conservat\u00f3ria17\u00b0 lists Talta's every\u00a0entry from the time of its organization in 2003 up to the issue of the certificate in\u00a02012, including appointments and removals of gerentes, the audit and deposit of\u00a0its annual accounts, and the change of its physical seat to another site in\u00a0Madeira.\nD. The Resnondent's Evidence\n204. On the other hand, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have their Effective\u00a0Seat in Argentina, because:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Argentina espoused the interests of Tenaris in an anti -dumping case before\nthe WTO, which points to the existence of a significant connection\nbetween the Claimants and Argentina;171\n- Most of Tenaris' employees are in Argentina;172\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenaris' President and CEO resides in Argentina, as do most members of\nits Executive Group and several members of its Board of Directors;173\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two managers of Talta reside in Argentina.174\n205. In Venezuela's opinion, the above facts point to the companies' Effective Seats\u00a0being in Argentina; however, the Respondent has failed to submit any evidence\u00a0that no activity at all is performed at the Statutory Seats.\n206. As to the Claimants' evidence, the Bolivarian Republic argues that, far from\u00a0proving that the members of Tenaris' Board physically met in Luxembourg,175\u00a0such evidence rather establishes that most of the Board meetings took place\u00a0outside of Luxembourg.176\n165 Exhibit C-121.\n166 C-209.\n167 Exhibit C-120.\n168 Exhibit C-6.\n169 Exhibit C-6, p. 5.\u00a0'\u00b0 Exhibit C-8.\n'' RIV, para. 233. 172 RIV, para. 249.\n' RIV, para. 249.\n' RV, para. 81.\nRVII, para. 28. 176 RVII, para. 26.\n56\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 60 of 201\nE. Assessment of the Evidence\n207. The Arbitral Tribunal has reviewed the evidence accompanying the experts'\u00a0reports and is of the opinion that Portuguese Law does create a presumption that\u00a0the Effective Seat matches the Statutory Seat. So is stated by Prof. Pinheiro,177\u00a0whose opinion has been relied upon by both Parties' experts:178\n\"Because the statutory seat is sally located in the country of organization, this means that, as regards these legal entities, the seat doctrine determines\u00a0that, in principle, the place of the statutory seat and the place of the seat of\u00a0administration match. This warrants a presumption that the company has the\u00a0seat of its administration in the State of its statutory seat. Applying this\u00a0presumption, in the absence of proof that the seat of administration is in a\u00a0different State, the Law of the statutory seat applies.\"\n208. The above said, the Tribunal has carefully analyzed and assessed the evidence\u00a0provided by the Parties and concludes that it is not persuaded that Tenaris and\u00a0Talta have its Effective Seat in Argentina, and it is its view that their Effective\u00a0Seats match their Statutory Seats:\na. Meeting of Management Organs\n209. There is no evidence that Tenaris' and Talta's management organs run the\u00a0companies from Argentina:\n210. Tenaris has submitted minutes that show that its shareholder meetings were held\u00a0in Luxembourg,179 and Talta, that its sole member held the meetings in Portugal;\u00a0as to their Boards:\nIn the four years between consent to arbitration and the Request for Arbitration, Tenaris' Board met 22 times via teleconference, 14 times\u00a0physically; of these 14, 8 meetings were held in Luxembourg, 2 in Mexico\u00a0and 1 in Argentina and 1 in the U.S.;18\u00b0 the evidence that links Argentina to\u00a0Tenaris' Board meetings is minimal; the preponderance of the evidence\u00a0points to the meetings being held in Luxembourg.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talta's Board always met in Portugal; there is no evidence pointing to a\ndifferent place other than Portugal, as the effective seat of Talta's management.\n211. Even though the Respondent argues that the President and CEO of Tenaris,\u00a0Paulo Rocca, and other members of Tenaris' Board reside in Argentina, there is\u00a0no evidence that the Board's decisions are made there, given the evidence that\u00a0the Board's meetings took place mostly in Luxembourg, and that Mr. Rocca was\u00a0present at all such meetings; in fact, the only three members that have ever\u00a0participated in a meeting by teleconference are Messrs. Sena Puche,181 Vogel182\n' MD -24. LuIs de Lima Pinheiro, Direito internacional privado, vol. II, Direito de conflitos. Parte especial (3\u00b0 ed., Almedina, Coimbra, 2009), p. 135.\n178 MD -24; Moura Vicente, footnote 20.\n179 CVI, Annex D.\n180 See para. 198 supra.\n181 CVI, Annex C, pp. 1, 15, 71.\n57\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 61 of 201\nand Monti,183 the former two being Mexican nationals and holding relevant offices in other Mexican companies, and joining the conference from Mexico,\u00a0and Mr. Monti, who joined in from Italy.\n212. Venezuela has also stated that the holding of Board meetings in ways other than\u00a0by physical presence would in itself be an indication that Tenaris' administration\u00a0was not being run from Luxembourg. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees. The\u00a0Respondent's own legal expert has acknowledged the validity of meetings held\u00a0via telecommunication, under the law of Luxembourg.184 And such domestic\u00a0legal system applies a presumption that meetings held by telecommunication are\u00a0deemed to have been held at the statutory seat.185\n213. Even if this were not so, however, there is no evidence that would link Tenaris'\u00a0actual administration precisely to Argentina.\n214. And, as far as Talta is concerned, its bylaws require that all decisions binding the\u00a0company be made by at least one of its two Portuguese managers - there is then\u00a0no indication either that its decisions were made in Argentina.\nb. Place of Business Management\n(i) Offices\n215. There is no evidence that Tenaris or Talta occupy offices in Argentina, and there\u00a0is evidence that they do so in Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively, as shown\u00a0by the lease agreements.\n216. However, Venezuela has called the relevance of the submitted evidence into\u00a0question: the Republic notes that Tenaris' lease agreement was signed under the\u00a0name of Ternium, with which Tenaris shares office space, and the 905 m2 of\u00a0leased space would be insufficient for a company the size of Tenaris.186 As to\u00a0Talta, Venezuela calls attention to the small size of the rented space and small\u00a0number of hired staff.187\n182 CVI, Annex C, p. 15.\n183 cvi, Annex C, p. 35.\n184 Steichen II, p. 16.\n185 Article 64(bis)(3) of the Law of August 25, 2006 (AP -20): \"A meeting held remotely by way of such means of\u00a0communication shall be deemed to have been held at the seat of the company.\" [English translation.I\n186 RV, para. 64.\n187 RV, para. 81.\n58\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 62 of 201\n217. None of these arguments is persuasive:\nTenaris and Ternium are two related companies (as Tenaris holds a 11.46% interest in Ternium),188 both share the same 905 m2 office space, which\u00a0Ternium has partially subleased to the Tenaris group;189 that the lease\u00a0agreement is formally in Ternium's name, and that Tenaris Investment\u00a0S.\u00e0.r.l. - a wholly -owned subsidiary of Tenaris19\u00b0 - acts as the sub -lessee\u00a0does not undermine the conclusion that Tenaris' effective seat is in\u00a0Luxembourg and matches its statutory seat.\n- Talta is a holding company - as will be discussed below - and this is compatible with a small office space and a small number of staff.\n(ii) Employees\n218. The Respondent argues that most of Tenaris' employees are in Argentina.191\n219. This argument is weak, as the (many) Argentine workers are hired by Siderca, an\u00a0Argentine subsidiary of Tenaris, not by Tenaris itself.192 The fact that a\u00a0subsidiary with its own legal -entity standing, located in Argentina, has a large\u00a0number of employees is inelevant for the purposes of determining where its\u00a0parent company's Effective Seat is located.\n(iii) Business Activity\n220. There is no evidence either that the business activity of Tenaris and Talta and\u00a0their relations with their clients are run from Argentina. Both companies are\u00a0holding companies and, as such, they manage their shareholding portfolio, but\u00a0do not cany out business activities with clients. In their public information, both\u00a0companies provide their Statutory Seat as contact information.\n221. In particular, the Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's expert Prof.\u00a0Maia, who contends that Talta is not a holding company but a company engaged\u00a0in iron trade. The expert bases his opinion on two inconect arguments:193\n222. (i) In the relat\u00f3rio of the business canied out in 2012, Talta states that its\n'88T p.603.\n189 Exhibit R-62.\nC-200, p. 56. 191 RIV, para. 249.\u00a0192 CV, para. 157.\u00a0193 T., pp. 1437 et seq.\n59\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 63 of 201\n\"normal business is related to the trade of iron, residue, and hot-briquetted iron.\"94\n223. However, the expert fails to take into consideration the fact that the relat\u00f3rio\u00a0also states that Talta holds interests in eight companies195 - all of them\u00a0apparently related to the iron and steel industry - and that its sales are the result\u00a0of brokerage in the purchase of goods between companies in the group. 196 This\u00a0confirms that the company is a holding company engaged in iron trade through\u00a0its investee companies.\n224. (ii) In its registration certificate197 Talta is categorized under the business code\u00a0for purchase and trade of minerals and iron, whereas a holding company would\u00a0appear under a different code; moreover, in order to be a holding company, it\u00a0should be subject to the special regime of Decree -Law 20 12/94.198\n225. It is possible, as noted by the expert, that Talta does not meet the requirements\u00a0set by Portuguese law in order to be registered as a holding company under\u00a0Decree -Law 2012/94, but this is actually not the point: the point here is not to\u00a0determine whether Talta has been formally registered as a holding company, but\u00a0to verify whether it canies out business activities vis-\u00e0-vis third parties at a place\u00a0other than its Statutory Seat. And the evidence on the record shows that Talta's\u00a0business is limited to the holding of interests in other companies and a brokerage\u00a0role in the purchase of goods between its investee companies, and there is no\u00a0proof that these activities were performed outside its Statutory Seat.\n(iv) Management\n226. Venezuela stresses the fact that two of Talta's managers reside in Argentina. 199\n227. This is true. Talta has a Board consisting of four gerentes, two of whom are\u00a0registered as residing in Argentina, while the other two reside in Portugal.20\u00b0\u00a0Those residing in Argentina are Group A managers, and the Portuguese\u00a0managers are Group B managers. In order to bind Talta, the joint signature of\u00a0one Group A and one Group B manager is required.201 Therefore, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal finds no indication that would point to the Effective Seat being in\u00a0Argentina, rather than Portugal.\n'94Exhibit C-202.

In addition, in their relations with third parties, both Tenaris and Talta provide\u00a0their offices in Luxembourg and Portugal as contact information.202 The\u00a0Respondent has not provided any evidence that shows that contact with third\u00a0parties takes place in Argentina.\nc.

As regards Talta's accounts, as per its\u00a0registration certificate, they are published on and deposited with the Registro\u00a0Mercantil da Zona Franca de Madeira.203\n230. The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that it has not been established that Tenaris and\u00a0Talta have their Effective Seats in Argentina; rather, the evidence points to their\u00a0Effective Seats being in Luxembourg and Portugal, respectively, and, therefore,\u00a0the Tribunal dismisses the objection to its ratione personae jurisdiction raised by\u00a0the Bolivarian Republic.\n202 Exhibits C-120, 121, 209.\n203 Exhibit C-8.\n61\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 65 of 201\n3. DEFECTS IN THE TAVSA NOTICE\n231. Article 9.1 of the Luxembourg BIT requires that:\n\"Any dispute between an investor and the other Contracting Party concerning the application of this Agreement shall be the subject of a\u00a0written notification, accompanied by a sufficiently detailed memorandum,\u00a0from the investor.\"\n232. As its last objection, Venezuela contends that the Arbitral Tribunal has no\u00a0jurisdiction over the claims for the alleged breaches of the obligation to confer\u00a0fair and equitable treatment to investments in connection with Tavsa, as this\u00a0claim was not included in the Tavsa Notice, as required by Article 9.1 of the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT. 204\n233. This argument need not be analyzed by the Arbitral Tribunal. Tenaris asserts its\u00a0claim for unfair and inequitable treatment as a subsidiary claim to its main claim,\u00a0which is the claim for Tavsa' s expropriation. The Claimant has expressed this in\u00a0very clear terms:205\n\"To the extent this Tnbunal concludes that Tenaris's investments in Tavsa have been indirectly expropriated and the Tribunal awards compensation\u00a0using a valuation date of 30 April 2008, then Tenaris will have been made\u00a0whole and it will not be necessary for the Tribunal to consider whether\u00a0Venezuela has breached the fair and equitable treatment provision of the\u00a0Luxembourg Treaty. If, however, the Tribunal uses a 2009 valuation date, it\u00a0will be necessaiy for the Tnbunal to consider whether Venezuela's\u00a0measures following the enactment of the Nationalization Decree 6058\u00a0breached the fair and equitable treatment clause of the Luxembourg Treaty\u00a0and if so, establish compensation at a date prior to Venezuela's breaches of\u00a0that Treaty.\"\n234. The Arbitral Tribunal is already in a position to say that its analysis of the merits\u00a0of the case will be that Venezuela did indeed indirectly expropriate Tenaris'\u00a0ownership in Tavsa. The main claim having been allowed, there is no need to\u00a0address the subsidiary one.\n204 RIV, paras. 267-273.\n205 CV, para. 320.\n62\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 66 of 201\nVI. EXPROPRIATION\n235. The Claimants' main claim is that Venezuela has unlawfully expropriated\u00a0Tenaris' investment in Tavsa (2.) and Tenaris' and Talta's investment in\u00a0Comsigua (3.), in breach of Articles 4 and IV of the Luxembourg and Portugal\u00a0BITs, respectively.\n236. Prior to delving into the analysis of these claims, it is necessary to provide a\u00a0detailed account of the facts of the case (1.).\n1. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n237. The Arbitral Tribunal will now provide a brief summary on the Claimants (A.),\u00a0their investment (B.), the allegedly expropriatory measures, (C.) and the\u00a0takeover (D.).\nA. The Claimants\n238. The Claimants are members of the Techint Group, an international conglomerate\u00a0in the steel industry, consisting of several groups of companies, including\u00a0Tenaris (the first Claimant) and Ternium S.A. ['Ternium\"I.\n239. Tenaris is a Luxembourg company206 listed on the main stock exchanges in the\u00a0United States, Italy, Argentina, and Mexico.207 Its business consists in the\u00a0manufacturing of pipes, which it handles indirectly through many subsidiaries\u00a0created in different countries. Two wholly -owned subsidiaries are relevant to this\u00a0arbitration:\n- Talta:208 the second Claimant, and a company organized under the laws of Portugal.209 Talta and, indirectly, Tenaris, hold a 7.58% shareholding in\u00a0Comsigua - one of the two allegedly -expropriated companies.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tubos de Acero de Mexico S.A.

['CVG Sidor\"I,216 one of the largest iron and\u00a0steel companies in Latin America.\n245. CVG Sidor had two production lines: one for steel, and another one for seamless\u00a0steel tubes. Because the production and sale of seamless steel tubes is a business\u00a0closely connected to the oil business and independent of the global market for\u00a0iron and steel products, the Government decided to split up the two business\u00a0lines and privatize them separately:217\n- The steel business was placed in the hands of Sidor, where Ternium became a shareholder,218 Ternium being, along with Tenaris, one of the\u00a0two groups of companies in the Techint Group.\nThe production of seamless steel tubes was transfened to a new CVG subsidiary by the name of Tubos Industriales y Petroleros, S.A. ['CVG-Tubos\"I,219 which was also privatized, and where Tamsa (a subsidiary of\u00a0Tenaris, one of the Claimants) became the holder of a 70% interest. Once\u00a0privatized, the company's name was changed to Tubos de Acero de\u00a0Venezuela S.A. (Tavsa).22\u00b0\n246. Physically, Tavsa remained located within Sidor' s premises, and Sidor provided\u00a0it with all the necessary supplies in order for it to be able to manufacture the\u00a0tubes, as done prior to the split.\n247. The privatization of CVG-Tubos took place through a strategic partnership\u00a0agreement ['Partnership Agreement\"1221 executed on October 9, 1998 between\u00a0CVG and Tamsa. In addition to transfening control from CVG, the Partnership\u00a0Agreement required Tamsa to devise a plan for investments in Tavsa, divided\u00a0into two phases:\nThe modernization program (Phase I): Phase I consisted in modernizing Tavsa's plant an increasing its production capacity to 65,000 tons per year\u00a0in a period of24 months.222 Phase I investments were estimated atUSD 25\u00a0to 30 million.223 On October 18, 2000, Tavsa notified CVG that its plant\u00a0capacity had increased to 65,000 tons, and it thus considered its Phase I\u00a0obligations fulfilled.224\n216 Exhibit C-16.\n217 Strategic Partnership Agreement between CVG and TAMSA, October 9, 1998, Exhibit C-19, clause 1.1(2).\n218 c, para. 15.\n219 Exhibit C-18.\n220 Certificate of Commercial Registry of Puerto Ord\u00e1z of CVG Tubos, November 23, 1998, Exhibit C-85, pp. 3, 9, 26;\u00a0Tavsa's Articles of Incorporation, Exhibit C-34.\n221 Strategic Partnership Agreement, October 9, 1998, Exhibit C-19, clause 2.1.\n222 The modernization program consisted in improving the efficiency of CVG-Tubos, increasing its production capacity up\u00a0to 65,000 metric tons of finished tubes.

Between 2002 and 2005, Tenaris acquired 100% of Tamsa's stock,228 and,\u00a0therefore, Tamsa's 70% shareholding in Tavsa.\nb. Comsigua\n249. Comsigua is one of the leading Venezuelan producers of hot-briquetted iron\u00a0['HBI\"I, which is used as a supply in steel production. It was created in the late\u00a01980s as a joint venture between a Japanese company (Kobe Steel Limited) and\u00a0CVG Fenominera Orinoco C.A., another CVG subsidiary. Initially, its\u00a0shareholders also included other investing companies of various nationalities,229\u00a0which would later on progressively leave the project.\n250. In 1995, Comsigua opened up to new investors, and this is how it was joined by\u00a0Tamsa (a Tenaris subsidiary) with a 6.92% interest.230 In 2007, Tamsa\u00a0transfened to Talta (another Tenaris subsidiary and a co -claimant in this\u00a0arbitration) its shares in Comsigua.231\n251. Almost at the same time as Tamsa acquired its interest in Comsigua, there were\u00a0other inward and outward changes in its shareholding structure: two of its initial\u00a0investors assigned their stock to Kobe Steel Limited and another three Japanese\u00a0companies collectively, \"Japanese Shareholders\"I 232 Two years later, another\u00a0investor left.

Takeover of the Exnronriated Assets\n270. In compliance with the Nationalization and Implementing Decrees, the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic did take control of the Expropriated Assets whose forced\u00a0acquisition had been decided upon. However, takeover took place differently at\u00a0each of the two Affected Companies, Tavsa (a.) and Comsigua (b.)\na. Tavsa\n271. On November 16, 2009, PDVSA Industrial (acting on behalf of the Republic)\u00a0took control of Tavsa' s management and operations, and all Expropriated Assets\u00a0belonging to said company were handed over.251 The State thus formally fulfilled\u00a0the order in Article 1 of the Implementing Decree, for the forced acquisition of\u00a0the Expropriated Assets.\n272. It is undisputed that Venezuela has not paid any compensation at all for the\u00a0expropriation of Tavsa's assets.\nb. Comsigua\n273. For Comsigua, the forced acquisition of the Expropriated Assets took place on\u00a0June 17, 2011, when the State, through an administrative decision, appointed the\u00a0company's new President, and Comsigua's management - which used to be in\u00a0private hands - was now occupied by new managers appointed by the\u00a0Government.252 At that moment, Comsigua's Expropriated Assets were placed at\u00a0the State's disposal, and the State then took control of the company's business\u00a0activity.\n274. As regards compensation, facts are a little more complicated than they are for\u00a0Tavsa, as certain shareholders have actually been paid compensation.\n275. Pro memoria, Comsigua's private shareholders were, basically, two: three\u00a0Japanese Shareholders, on the one hand, and Talta, on the other.\n276. The Compensation Commission created under the Nationalization and Implementing Decrees soon split up to negotiate with the Japanese Shareholders\u00a0and Talta separately.253 The outcome of those negotiations was mixed:\nThe Japanese Shareholders were successful in their negotiations, and reached a compensation agreement with the Venezuelan State, which the\u00a0parties formalized in the form of a \"share assignment agreement.\" The\u00a0compensation reached USD 200 million.254\n251 Record of the Transfer of exclusive Control and Operation of Commercial Company Tavsa, Tubos de Acero de\u00a0Venezuela S.A., November 16, 2009, Exhibit C-71, p. 4.\n252 Exhibit R-64.\n253 Exhibit R-41; Exhibit R-46; CRED-59.\n254 Comsigua Share and Asset Assignment Agreement, May 20, 2011, Exhibit C-72, clauses 1.1, 3.

The factual background thus nanated, the Arbitral Tribunal will now analyze the\u00a0parties' position as regards the expropriations of Tavsa (2.) and Comsigua (3.),\u00a0and will then state its decision (4.).\n2. \u00a0\u00a0THE PARTIES' POSITIONS REGARDING TAVSA\n278. It is a fact that Venezuela expropriated Tavsa's assets. The only disputed issue\u00a0between the Parties is whether such expropriation breached Article 4 of the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT,255 which provides as follows:\n\"1. Each Contracting Party undertakes not to adopt any measure of expropriation or nationalization or any other measure with the effect of\u00a0directly or indirectly dispossessing the investors of the other Contracting\u00a0Party of the investments belonging to them in its territory, unless the\u00a0following conditions are fulfilled:\na) the measures are adopted for reasons for public purpose or national\u00a0interest;\nb) the measures are adopted in accordance with legal procedures;\nc) they are neither discriminatory nor contrary to a specific commitment\u00a0concerning the treatment of an investment;\nd) they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of adequate and\u00a0effective compensation.\n2. The amount of the compensation shall correspond to the real value of the investment concerned on the day prior to the adoption or publication of the\u00a0measures.\nThe compensation shall be paid in convertible currency. It shall be paid without undue delay and shall be freely transferable. Interest shall be paid at\u00a0the normal commercial rate from the date of its determination to the date of\u00a0payment.\nA. The Claimants' Position\n279. The Claimants argue that, pursuant to Article 4.1(b) of the Luxembourg BIT,\u00a0expropriation measures must be taken \"in accordance with legal procedures;\"256\u00a0this obligation requires observing the domestic Law procedures (a.). 257 Article\n255 CIV, para. 194. The Parties are not in agreement either as to the compensation that is due; that, however, is a matter to\u00a0be discussed in a specific section.\n256 Exhibit C -ibis, Article 4(i)(b).\n257 CV, paras. 204 et seq.\n73\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 77 of 201\n4.1(c) and 2 requires that the State pay compensation upon expropriation (b.). According to the Claimants, both requirements have been disregarded in this\u00a0case.\na. \u00a0\u00a0Breach of Venezuelan Law\n280. In the Claimants' opinion, the Respondent's expropriation measures breached\u00a0the following instruments of Venezuelan law:\n- The 1999 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ['Constitution\"I and LECUPS (i.);\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Nationalization Decree (ii.); and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Implementing Decree (iii.).\n(i) The Constitution and LECUPS\n281. The Claimants argue that Venezuela breached Article 115 of the Constitution\u00a0and Article 2 of LECUPS,258 as it physically took over Tavsa's assets without\u00a0enforcing a final judgment and without paying fair compensation. 259 And it does\u00a0not seem to intend to do so since, as of today, Venezuela has yet to complete the\u00a0expropriation and compensation procedure, even though more than seven years\u00a0have elapsed since the issue of the Nationalization Decree and the Forced\u00a0Acquisition of Tavsa's Assets.26\u00b0\n(ii) Nationalization Decree\n282. Venezuela did not follow the procedures provided for in the Nationalization\u00a0Decree:261\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It failed to set up the Takeover Commission for Tavsa within the period\nprescribed in Article 5 (May 19, 2008), only doing so a year later: May 25, 2009;262\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It failed to transfer control of Tavsa's activities to the State on the date\nprescribed in Article 5, i.e. June 30, 2008;263\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It failed to set up the Compensation Commission in charge of negotiating\nthe fair price for Tavsa's nationalization provided for in Article 7;264\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It failed to follow the expropriation procedure prescribed in LECUPS, as\nrequired in Article 8:265 it did not order the formal expropriation of Tavsa's\n258 CIV, para. 220; CV, para. 209.\n259 CIV, para. 220; H 1, slides 73, 74.\n260 Exhibit C-71.\n261 CIV, para. 224.\n262 CI, para. 135; CIV, para. 224(a); CV, paras. 52, 90, 211(a); Exhibit C-57 (Comsigua); Exhibit C-58 (Tavsa).\n263 Exhibit C -SO, Article S.\n2CV,para. 211.\n265 Exhibit C -SO, Article 8.\n74\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 78 of 201\nshares upon the failure to reach an agreement within a period of 60 days.266\n(iii) Implementing Decree\n283. According to the Claimants, the Respondent also failed to comply with the\u00a0provisions of the Implementing Decree:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It failed to set up the Takeover Commission within the period prescribed in\nArticle 3: July 15, 2009;267\n- The Government unilaterally extended the period for Tavsa's Compensation Commission to December 29, 2009, without Tenaris'\u00a0agreement, and it formally took control of the assets prior to the expiration\u00a0of such period (November 16, 2009);268\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period set for Tavsa's Compensation Commission having expired\nwithout an agreement having been reached on the subject of fair price, Venezuela failed to comply with Article 5, as it did not commence court\u00a0expropriation proceedings P269\nb. Failure to Pay Compensation\n284. It is undisputed that Tenaris never received any compensation at all for the\u00a0expropriation of Tavsa's assets.\n285. The Claimants contend that the mere constitution of a commission and the\u00a0establishment of a negotiation process are not enough to discharge the\u00a0obligations provided for in the Luxembourg BIT:\nVenezuela is required to try to reach an agreement on the compensation due; in this case, PDVSA Industrial, which was appointed to represent\u00a0Venezuela in the negotiations, refused to meet with Tenaris' legal\u00a0representatives,270 in spite of their attempts to reach an agreement;271\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BIT requires payment of compensation which, in addition, needs to be\nadequate; Venezuela never set out to pay adequate compensation, as it made no provision to cover lost profits.272\n286. Not only does the failure to pay compensation breach Venezuela's domestic\u00a0rules on the subject; it also violates Articles 4.1(d) and 4.2 of the Luxembourg\u00a0BIT, which require that the State pay \"adequate and effective\" compensation\u00a0\"without undue delay.\"273\n287.

The Resnondent's Position\n288. Venezuela acknowledges having expropriated Tavsa's assets but contends no\u00a0unlawful expropriation claims, as put forth by Tenaris, are in order. 278 According\u00a0to the Respondent, the expropriation was done according to Law (a.) and, in\u00a0addition, it also satisfied the requirements of the Luxembourg BIT as regards\u00a0payment of fair compensation (b.).\na. Compliance with the Law\n289. The Respondent denies any violation of Venezuelan Law (i.) or international\u00a0Law (ii.) in the course of the expropriation.\n(i) Venezuelan Law\n290. As per the Bolivarian Republic's claims, Tavsa's expropriation was done under\u00a0the Nationalization Decree, as supplemented by the Implementing Decree:279\n- The Nationalization Decree refers generally to Sidor's subsidiaries but, because it does not expressly mention Tavsa, it had no direct effects on it;\nBy contrast, the Implementing Decree contains the supplementary provisions through which the nationalization of Sidor's subsidiaries could\u00a0be canied out, including Tavsa, which is expressly mentioned in this\u00a0second Decree.28\u00b0\n291. The Respondent denies that the Decrees violate any Venezuelan law provision:\u00a0Article 8 of the Nationalization Decree allowed the occupation of Tavsa' s assets\u00a0prior to completion of the judicial expropriation proceedings, in order to ensure\u00a0continuity in the companies' operations. It is the Bolivarian Republic's\u00a0contention that Article 8 of the Nationalization Decree is valid, as its contents\u00a0actually amount to an interim measure, as recognized by Venezuelan court\u00a0decisions.281 And such interim measure is compatible with:\n274 The tribunal found that Ecuador's failure to pay compensation to Burlington for its expropriatoiy actions did, by itself,\u00a0render the expropriation unlawful, Burlington, paras. 543-45.\n275 The tribunal found that no compensation had been paid, and the expropriation did not satisfy the requirements of the\u00a0ap6plicable treaty and, therefore, it was unlawful, Siemens, para. 273.\n27 The tribunal found that a State's compensation offer that is inconsistent with the criterion laid down in the investment treaty renders the expropriation unlawful, ConocoPhillips, paras. 398-401.\n277 01 European, paras. 422-426. 278RV,para. 131.\n279 RIlI, para. 283.\n280 RIlI, para. 287.\n281 RV, para. 132; RIV, paras. 285-286.\n76\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 80 of 201\nThe constitutional guarantee, as the interim measure will end upon completion of the expropriation proceedings with the issue of a court\u00a0judgment;282 and, in any event, the alleged unconstitutionality of the\u00a0interim measure should have been raised before the Venezuelan court\u00a0system, which was not the case; therefore, as long as it is not ruled\u00a0unconstitutional, the mechanism laid down by the Nationalization Decree\u00a0stands fully valid and compliance with it is mandatory;283\n- The LECUPS regime, as the regime established by the Nationalization Decree, which has the rank of an organic law and is more specific on the\u00a0subject, prevails.284\n(ii) International Law\n292. The Respondent argues that Tavsa's nationalization procedure complied with the\u00a0due process requirements under international Law:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenaris was notified sufficiently in advance: the Government's intention to\ntake control of Tavsa's assets was stated both in the Implementing Decree and, even earlier still, in Letters Nos. 233/09 and 230/09;285\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenaris was afforded the right to be heard: Tenaris itself acknowledges as\nmuch when claiming to have participated in Tavsa's Takeover and\nCompensation Commissions ;286\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even though Tenaris could have exercised the administrative and judicial\nremedies available to it under Venezuela's domestic law, it chose not to do so.287\n293. Venezuela admits that the process extended beyond the time periods provided\u00a0for in the Nationalization Decree, but explains that such extension was justified\u00a0by the complexity of the matters at issue, in addition to delays attributable to\u00a0Tenaris itself.288 In any event, Venezuela argues that these minor violations of its\u00a0domestic Law do not amount to an internationally wrongful act. 289\nb. \u00a0\u00a0Fair Compensation under the BIT\n294. The Bolivarian Republic denies that the failure to pay compensation does, per\u00a0Se, render the expropriation unlawful,29\u00b0 as argued by Tenaris.

The Respondent also relies on Saluka, where the\u00a0tribunal established that a bilateral investment treaty may not be interpreted as penalizing each and every violation of the\u00a0multiple rules and regulations Government action is subject to that could normally be pursued by the investor before the\u00a0local courts and tribunals, Saluka, para. 133.\n290 RIlI, para. 309\n77\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 81 of 201\nRespondent's standpoint, what is required under Article 4.1(d) of the Luxembourg BIT is that the expropriatory measures be accompanied by\u00a0appropriate mechanisms to ensure the payment of fair, effective, and timely\u00a0compensation, with the commencement of a court proceeding to that end not\u00a0being an essential requirement. 291\n295. Venezuela has indeed commenced expropriation proceedings under the\u00a0Implementing Decree,292 and those proceedings are still pending. When\u00a0completed, there will be a court judgment ordering the decreed transfer of title\u00a0and payment of fair compensation.293 And this has not yet happened because\u00a0Tenaris hindered the expropriation proceedings with its early filing of a Request\u00a0for Arbitration,294 which, according to the Bolivarian Republic, is one more\u00a0demonstration of Tenaris' uncompromising attitude, devoid of good faith, as, at\u00a0the time, it prevented an agreement on compensation from being reached.295\n296. As to the specific allegation that Venezuela failed to provide for compensation\u00a0for lost profits, without which compensation would not be \"adequate\" as\u00a0required by the BIT, it is the Respondent's view that the fair price due for an\u00a0expropriated asset is one thing, and compensation for a wrongful act is an\u00a0entirely different matter.296 According to the Respondent, expropriation is a State\u00a0prerogative, not a wrongful act, and, in this regard, the Implementing Decree\u00a0specifies that compensation will equal the real value of the expropriated asset,\u00a0and nothing further.297\n3. \u00a0\u00a0THE PARTIES' POSITIONS AS REGARDS COMSIGUA\n297. The main item of relief sought by the Claimants is that the Tribunal rule that\u00a0Venezuela breached Articles 4 and IV of the Luxembourg and Portugal BITs,\u00a0respectively, both provisions having equivalent contents. In their opinion,\u00a0Venezuela has unlawfully expropriated their investment in Comsigua.298 The\u00a0Respondent denies any such expropriation.299\n298. The Parties' arguments are, for the most part, the same as put forth in connection\u00a0with Tavsa. For this reason, the Tribunal refers back to paragraphs 279-296\u00a0supra and, in this section, it will only provide an account of the additional\u00a0arguments the Parties have asserted specifically in connection with Comsigua.\nA. The Claimants' Position\n299.

The Expropriation of the Investment in Comsigua\n300. The Claimants argue that Venezuela expropriated their investment in\u00a0Comsigua,30\u00b0 as a result of the Nationalization Decree and the Implementing\u00a0Decree:\nThe Nationalization Decree ordered the nationalization of the entire steel industry in the Guayana region, including all of Sidor's affiliates,\u00a0Comsigua being one of them;301 and, in spite of the fact that the\u00a0Nationalization Decree provided for direct expropriation,302 Venezuela\u00a0subsequently issued the Implementing Decree, where, rather than ordering\u00a0the acquisition of Comsigua's shares, it ordered an \"acquisition of assets,\"\u00a0thereby rendering the expropriation an indirect one;303\nLater on, pursuant to these two Decrees, Venezuela took Comsigua's assets as its own, and took control of its administration,304 thereby\u00a0interfering with the Claimants' property rights;305\nWith the exception of the Japanese Shareholders, the Bolivarian State has not paid compensation to any shareholder of the four HBI manufacturing\u00a0companies that were nationalized by virtue of those Decrees.306\n301. The Claimants also argue that, since the Takeover Commission was tasked with\u00a0transforming Comsigua into a socialist iron and steel corporation, their shares in\u00a0Comsigua lost all value.307 In their opinion, nobody would pay for a minority\u00a0interest in a State-controlled company that remains \"subject to nationalization\u00a0through two Decrees.\"308 However, prior to the nationalization, when Comsigua\u00a0was privately managed and its aim was to maximize the investors' returns,309 the\u00a0Claimants could have easily transferred their interest to another minority\u00a0shareholder or a third party.31\u00b0\n302. The Claimants maintain that case law is consistent that measures which actually\u00a0destroy an investment or deprive the investor of the use or enjoyment of its\u00a0investment, including a deprivation of all or a substantial portion of the\u00a0economic benefit of its property, are as expropriatory as the formal taking of title\u00a0to the investors' assets.311 And, therefore, Venezuela should compensate the\n300 CIV, para. 195.\n301 CI, para. 127.

Moreover, Talta also brings up Alpha: \"it is recognized in\u00a0international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are\u00a0rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have\u00a0expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner,\" Alpha, para. 408.\n79\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 83 of 201\nClaimants for the fair value of their investment.312\nb. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela Did Not Pay Compensation for the Comsigua Expropriation\n303. The Claimants have not been paid any compensation for their investment in\u00a0Comsigua, which renders the expropriation unlawful:\nVenezuela took over Comsigua without offering an immediate and prior payment, as required by the BIT. Even though certain discussions were had\u00a0concerning some possible compensation, the investor was never presented\u00a0with a formal offer.313\nIn any event, that potential compensation expressly left lost profits out, and compensation was thus not adequate as required by the BIT:314 the fair\u00a0market value required by the BITs is the price a hypothetical \"willing\u00a0buyer\" would pay; this buyer would have assessed the price based on the\u00a0expected future profits.315\n304. In addition, the Claimants argue that Venezuela expropriated their investment in\u00a0Comsigua in a discriminatory manner, as it did pay compensation to the\u00a0Japanese Shareholders but not to Talta.316 This would be another argument to\u00a0label the expropriation unlawful P317\nB. The Resnondent's Position\n305. Venezuela denies all of these allegations.\na. There Was No Expropriation\n306. The Respondent acknowledges taking control of Comsigua; it does, however,\u00a0contend that it did so without nationalizing, expropriating or in any way\u00a0affecting Talta' s shareholding.318\n307. First, neither of the two Decrees had expropriatory effects:\n- The Nationalization Decree did not affect Comsigua, as the only companies that were nationalized were Sidor and its subsidiaries, and\u00a0Comsigua does not qualify as such.319\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sole purpose of the Implementing Decree was to transfer control of\ncertain companies (including Comsigua) to the State; this goal was attained\nthrough the purchase, by CVG (a state-owned company), of 73% of\n312 c, para. 132.\n313 CIV, para. 246.\n314 cv, para. 201.\n315 Sistem Mtihendislik, para. 189.\n316 CI, paras. 143 et seq.\nCI, para. 144. In support of its position, Talta contends that the two BITs prohibit expropriation from being discriminatory. The Claimant believes that Saluka applies here, as the tribunal there stated that \"non discrimination\u00a0requires a rational justification of any differential treatment of a foreign investor,\" Saluka, para. 460.\n318 RIlI, para. 275.\n319 RIV, para. 274.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 84 of 201\nComsigua's stock from the Japanese Shareholders.32\u00b0 Once in control, there was no longer any need for the State to expropriate Comsigua,321 or,\u00a0therefore, affect Talta's shares; in consequence, the Implementing Decree\u00a0ceased to apply to Comsigua.322 The Respondent notes that neither Decree\u00a0forces the Government to cany out the planned expropriation where, as\u00a0was the case with Comsigua, the company can be transformed into a state-owned company through the acquisition of a majority share interest. 323\n308. Second, Talta's situation has not been affected: it had a 7.58% minority interest\u00a0in Comsigua prior to the State's acquisition of the majority interest, and it\u00a0continues to hold the same percentage shareholding today324 in a company that\u00a0remains in operation, generating cash flows,325 and where Talta may exercise\u00a0each and every right arising from its shareholding. There are then no reasons to\u00a0assume, as expected by the Claimants, that their shares in Comsigua have no\u00a0value at all326 because no one would be willing to purchase them.327\n309. Third, as regards the argument that Venezuela discriminated against Talta\u00a0relative to the Japanese Shareholders, the Bolivarian Republic denies this\u00a0allegation: nothing in the language of Article 6 of the Implementing Decree\u00a0requires that an agreement be reached with all of a company's shareholders.328\u00a0The Decree's only requirement is that every shareholder in Comsigua be\u00a0afforded the opportunity to negotiate an agreement, an opportunity Talta was\u00a0indeed given, but turned down.329\nb. The Failure to Pay Compensation is Justified\n310. The Bolivarian Republic argues that Talta refused to engage in negotiations to\u00a0sell its stock along with the other Japanese Shareholders.33\u00b0\n311. Later on, Venezuela offered the Claimants the same price per share of stock it\u00a0had offered to the Japanese Shareholders.331 However, the Claimants did not\u00a0accept this proposal, as they expected to close a deal that would encompass all of\u00a0their Venezuelan interests and, in particular, the compensation they were seeking\u00a0in connection with Matesi's expropriation.332\n312. And because, upon a failure to reach a global agreement for all of their interests,\u00a0the Claimants felt they were covered by the BITs, which protected their\u00a0investment (which was not the case with the Japanese Shareholders, who had no\u00a0BIT in place with Venezuela).333\nRIV, para. 275.

THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL'S DECISION\n313. First of all, the Tribunal will go over the rules established in the BITs on the\u00a0subject of expropriation (1.). Then, it will summarize the circumstances in which\u00a0Tavsa's and Comsigua's expropriations took place (2.), and will determine\u00a0whether these two expropriations breached the provisions of the BITs (3.).\n4.1 The BITs\n314. The BITs forbid the State from adopting expropriation or nationalization\u00a0measures, as well as measures tantamount to such, unless certain requirements\u00a0are satisfied:\nLuxembourg BIT\nArt. 4.1:\n\"Each Contracting Party undertakes not to adopt any measure of expropriation or nationalization or any other measure with the effect of\u00a0directly or indirectly dispossessing the investors of the other Contracting\u00a0Party of the investments belonging to them in its territory, unless the\u00a0following conditions are fulfilled:\na) the measures are adopted for reasons for public purpose or national\u00a0interest;\nb) the measures are adopted in accordance with legal procedures;\nc) they are neither discriminatory nor contrary to a specific commitment\u00a0concerning the treatment of an investment;\nd) they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of adequate and\u00a0effective compensation.\"\nPortuguese BIT\nArticle IV. 1:\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take measures that deprive, directly or indirectly, the investors of the other Contracting Party of the investments\u00a0made by them, except if the following conditions are fulfilled:\na) that the measures are adopted for reasons of public purposes or national interest, in accordance with the legislation in force;\nb) that the measures are not discriminatory;\nc) that the measures are accompanied by provisions that guarantee the payment of immediate, adequate and effective compensation; this\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 86 of 201\ncompensation shall be based on the market value of the investment in question immediately prior to the moment at which the measures was made\u00a0public; compensation will accrue interest at the exchange rate applicable at\u00a0the date in which the transaction becomes effective, in the territory where\u00a0the investment is located; the lawfulness of the referred measures and the\u00a0amount of compensation may be submitted for review pursuant to the\u00a0applicable legal procedure.\"\n315. The term \"medida,\" which is not defined in the BITs, should be interpreted in\u00a0the broadest possible manner. So is infened from the very language of the\u00a0Treaties, which add the indefinite adjective \"ninguna\" and the generic plural\u00a0\"methdas\" to highlight its broad scope.\n316. Therefore, the term covers all kinds of administrative, legislative or judicial\u00a0actions by any of the branches of the Bolivarian Republic, and prohibits any\u00a0such actions resulting in expropriation, nationalization, or a tantamount measure.\n317. \"Expropriation\" takes place when, exercising a sovereign power, the State takes\u00a0a measure that deprives the investor of its investment, taking away control of or\u00a0title to that investment. Therefore, loss of title to the goods or assets is not a\u00a0requirement. It is sufficient for the investor to lose control of its investment.\n318. \"Nationalization\" is a concept similar to expropriation, with the peculiarity that\u00a0it usually affects entire sectors of an economy, whose exploitation the State has\u00a0decided to reserve to itself.\n319. Each BIT refers to tantamount measures in different but synonymous terms\u00a0(\"any other Ilmeasurel whose effect is to dispossess the investors directly or\u00a0indirectly\" or any \"measure which indirectly denies... the investors.., the\u00a0investments\").\n320. These are legislative, judicial or administrative actions of a State that\u00a0significantly interfere with the use and enjoyment of the investment, to an extent\u00a0such that its value is destroyed, without, however, depriving the investor of title\u00a0and control.\n321. The prohibition to take measures of expropriation or nationalization or\u00a0tantamount measures is not an absolute one. The BITs do allow them, provided\u00a0that the State fulfills certain requirements:\nThat they serve a public purpose;\nThat they are taken in accordance with legal procedures;\nThat they are not discriminatory; and\nThat they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of compensation, which must be adequate and effective, and be based on the market value of\u00a0the investments prior to their becoming public, and the payment of which\u00a0must be effected without undue delay, in a freely transfenable cunency,\u00a0accruing interest.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 87 of 201\n4.2 TAVSA AND COMSIGUA HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF EXPROPRIATION\n322. Venezuela acknowledges it indirectly expropriated Tenaris' investment in\u00a0Tavsa:334 indeed, all of Tavsa's assets have become the property of the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic, even though Tenaris still holds title to Tavsa's shares, with\u00a0Tavsa having become a mere shell company, deprived of all of its assets and its\u00a0business activities.335\n334RV,para. 131.\nSee para. 271 supra.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 88 of 201\nA. Comsh!ua-SDecific Features\n323. The Bolivarian Republic, however, denies having expropriated the Claimants'\u00a0assets in Comsigua.336\n324. The Arbitral Tribunal does not agree.\n325. The facts prove otherwise: the Venezuelan State made a decision to nationalize\u00a0all of Comsigua's assets (a.), and it did indeed cany out its decision, depriving\u00a0the Claimants of their investment in Venezuela (b.).\na. The Decision to Expropriate Comsigua\n326. In issuing the Nationalization Decree in 2008, President Chavez formalized the\u00a0decision to nationalize the iron and steel sector in Guayana - which Comsigua\u00a0was a part of:\n\"Article 1. For reasons of national convenience and in light of its relation to activities that are strategic for the development of this Nation, the iron ore\u00a0transformation industry in the Guayana region is hereby reserved to the\u00a0State, as this is an area holding the largest iron deposit, the exploitation of\u00a0which has been reserved to the State since 1975.\"\n327. One year later, President Chavez publicly confirmed Comsigua's nationalization\u00a0in a speech broadcast on television on May 21, 2009 before a group of workers\u00a0of the iron and steel sector, who cheered their approval:337\n\"The hot briqiietted iron sector - nationalize it; there is nothing to be discussed. The company [.1 Comsigua, [.1 Tiibos Tavsa, nationalize\u00a0them.\"\n328. The President's announcement was followed by another decree, the\u00a0Implementing Decree, elaborating on the Nationalization Decree and ordering\u00a0the acquisition of the assets of four iron and steel companies, including Tavsa\u00a0and Comsigua:\n\"Article 1. There is hereby ordered the acquisition of the assets of business companies [.1 Complejo Sider\u00f1rgico de Girnyana S.A. (Comsigua), 11.1\u00a0Tubos de Acero de Venezuela S.A. (Tavsa), their subsidiaries and affiliates\u00a0[.1 with the aim of transforming them into State companies [..1.\"\n329. It should be noted that, pursuant to the Implementing Decree, the target of the\u00a0expropriation was the set of assets owned by Comsigua (\"Expropriated Assets\"),\u00a0which were necessary to carry out the company's business activity - not the\u00a0shares held by the investors in this company.\n336RV,para. 115.\nExhibit C-56.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 89 of 201\nb. The Forced Acquisition of the Expropriated Assets\n330. Pro memoria: A few months after the Implementing Decree came into effect,\u00a0and relying on it, Venezuela formally took control of the Expropriated Assets\u00a0from Tavsa.338 Such takeover was formalized via the so-called \"Record of\u00a0Transfer\" of November 16, 2009.\n331. For Comsigua, control over the Expropriated Assets was transferred two years\u00a0later, on June 17, 2011. On such date, the following decisions were made:34\u00b0\nFirst, Minister Jos\u00e9 Khan, who, in turn, served as President of the state-owned CVG (a shareholder of Comsigua), issued an executive decision in the form of resolution number 041- 11, whereby Ivan Nicol\u00e1s Hern\u00e1ndez\u00a0Rojas was appointed new President of Comsigua;341\nSecond, at the Shareholders' Meeting that was held on that very same day,342 there was ratified the forced appointment of the new President of\u00a0Comsigua;343\nThird, those who had thus far occupied management positions at Comsigua resigned from their offices.344\n332. The minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting expressly acknowledges that it is then\u00a0that Comsigua's nationalization was completed, using language such as:\n\"We are handing the Company's management over to those who are coming to take our place as a result of Comsigua's Nationalization\n\"The natural consequence of the Nationalization of Comsigua was the termination of the contracts between the Company and its shareholders for\u00a0the sale of HBI and technical support ..\n333. The Tribunal thus finds that, on June 17, 2011, the State took the Expropriated\u00a0Assets and took control of Comsigua's business activity.\n338 \"consistently with Decree 6796 [...].\"\nExhibit C-71.\nExhibit R-64.\n341 Exhibit R-64, p. 1.\n342 Exhibit R-64.\nExhibit R-64, p. 11: \"It is hereby decided: To appoint Mr. Ivan Hem\u00e1ndez President of the Company and Chairman of the Board.\"\nExhibit R-64, p. 11: \"It is hereby decided: To acknowledge and record the resignation of those who, having been appointed, designated, proposed andlor elected by the [Japanese Shareholdersi, since the last shareholders' meeting, have\u00a0been in charge of managing the assets of the Company up to June 17, 2011.\"\nExhibit R-64, p. 9.

Venezuela has not paid any compensation for the expropriation of Tavsa's\u00a0assets, nor does there seem to have been any serious negotiations on the subject.\n335. The situation is somewhat different as regards Comsigua. In this case, the State\u00a0did commence negotiations with the private shareholders in order to agree on the\u00a0compensation due them:\nNegotiations with the Japanese Shareholders were successful and the compensation was formalized through the so-called \"Share and Asset\u00a0Assignment Agreement,\"347 pursuant to the Nationalization Decree and the\u00a0Implementing Decree:\n\"[. .J an agreement has been reached to enter into this share sale contract, pursuant to Decrees Nos. 6058 and 6796 [.1.\"\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talta was also made a compensation offer,348 on terms similar to those of\nthe compensation paid to the Japanese Shareholders, which, for the reasons discussed in paragraphs 377-3 80 infra, never actually became a reality.\nC. Conclusion\n336. The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the Bolivarian Republic took for itself all of\u00a0the assets of Tavsa and of Comsigua and took control of the business activity\u00a0these companies had been engaged in so far, which resulted in the expropriation\u00a0of Tenaris' and Talta's investment in Venezuela. Tavsa and Comsigua have been\u00a0reduced to just two shell companies whose assets now belong to Venezuela and\u00a0whose business activity is carried out by the State.\n337. This expropriation may be labeled indirect (as done by the Claimants), because\u00a0both investors continue to hold formal title to their shares in the two companies\u00a0whose assets have been the subject of expropriation.\nD. The Resnondent's Counter -Arguments\n338. In response to this conclusion, the Respondent has raised two counter -arguments:\na. Exclusion from the Scope of Application of the Implementing Decree\n339. The Implementing Decree explicitly ordered the nationalization of Comsigua's\u00a0assets - Venezuela does not deny this fact. However, Venezuela suggests that\u00a0the Implementing Decree no longer applies to the Claimants' investment in\u00a0Comsigua. The argument is somewhat complicated: the Bolivarian Republic\u00a0suggests that the Decree will not apply to the Claimants' investment in\u00a0Comsigua because Venezuela has already achieved its goal of converting\u00a0Comsigua into a state-owned company. It did so by acquiring the majority\u00a0shareholding that used to be held by the Japanese Shareholders. Venezuela\nExhibit C-72.\n348 CRED-59.\n88\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 91 of 201\nargues that, once Comsigua's nationalization was achieved, it was no longer necessary to enforce the Nationalization Decree as against the Claimants to\u00a0secure title to their shares in Comsigua.349\n340. The argument might perhaps be relevant if expropriation or nationalization\u00a0required that the State take title to the shares of the company that owns the assets\u00a0that are used to carry out the business' activity.\n341. But this is not the case.\n342. What is relevant in order to determine whether an expropriation or\u00a0nationalization took place is whether the State took control (the so-called\u00a0\"taking\") of the company or the assets of the investor.350 Where there is a taking,\u00a0whether formal title to the stock is transfened to the State is inelevant.351\n343. In the instant case, the Implementing Decree provided that the target of the\u00a0expropriation would be all assets of Comsigua - not the shares owned by its\u00a0shareholders. On June 17, 2011, Venezuela completed the company's\u00a0nationalization, appointing its new President and taking the Expropriated Assets\u00a0via an administrative decision. Following this taking of all of its assets and its\u00a0entire business activity, Comsigua became a mere empty shell, without any\u00a0business or corporate activity of its own.\n344. To conclude, in spite of formally retaining title to their shares, the Claimants\u00a0have suffered an expropriation of their investment in Comsigua, as the assets and\u00a0business activity of Comsigua have been taken by, and are now the property of,\u00a0the State.\nb. Unchanged Value\n345. The Bolivarian Republic has put forth a second argument: the Claimants'\u00a0investment in Comsigua has remained unchanged before and after the\u00a0Decrees.352 On the contrary, the Claimants deny this: in their view, after\u00a0Comsigua's nationalization as a result of the Nationalization Decree and the\u00a0Implementing Decree, the value of their investment353 and rights354 as\u00a0shareholders has been destroyed.\nR III, para. 278.\n350 A. Remisch, \"The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law\" (Ed. C. Schreuer et al.), Oxford University\u00a0Press, 2008, p. 421: \"As opposed to direct expropriation, which involves the taking of property, indirect expropriation\u00a0may occur when measures short of an actual taking 'result in the effective loss of management, use or control, or a\u00a0significant depreciation of the value of the assets of a foreign investor.\n351 UNCTAD, Taking of Property, Series on issues in international investment agreements, New York, Geneva, United\u00a0Nations, 2000, p. 4: \"The taking of property by Governments can result from legislative or administrative acts that\u00a0transfer title and physical possession. Takings can also result from official acts that effectuate the loss of management,\u00a0use or control, or a significant depreciation in the value, of assets.\"\n352 RIV, para. 278.\nCV, para. 194.\nCV, paras. 192, 193.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 92 of 201\n346. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants.\n347. The value of a business investment channeled through a company set up in the\u00a0host State is equal to the value of the investor's rights as a shareholder. The\u00a0Tribunal has verified that the Claimants have lost the entire value of their\u00a0investment in Comsigua, as they have been deprived of their shareholder rights\u00a0since June 17, 2011:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President of the company has been appointed by an executive decision\nof a Minister, not the shareholders;\n- Since then, no shareholders' meeting has been called and no annual financial statements have been prepared.355\n348. The Claimants have thus been deprived of any possible involvement in the\u00a0business activity or corporate life of Comsigua or the possibility of benefitting\u00a0from them. Tenaris and Talta were the owners of an investment that consisted in\u00a0them being shareholders in a Venezuelan company that canied out a business\u00a0activity. As a result of the State's intervention, they have become shareholders in\u00a0a shell company, which gives its owners no voting or monetary rights.\nThe Value of their Interest in Comsigua\n349. The Arbitral Tribunal shares the Claimants' view that their shareholding in\u00a0Comsigua is cunently valueless.\n350. The Claimants contend that, prior to the Decrees, they could have sold their\u00a0shares to any of the other minority shareholders or a third party356 (as done by\u00a0minority shareholder IFC a year prior to the effective date of the Nationalization\u00a0Decree)\n351. The former option is now off the table, as Talta is Comsigua's sole minority\u00a0shareholder; and the latter option is virtually non-existent, given the evisceration\u00a0of the shareholders' decision -making and monetary rights. The only possible\u00a0buyer would be the State itself; however, in spite of having gotten to the point of\u00a0making an offer, in the end the State decided not to proceed with the purchase of\u00a0the Claimants' stock in Comsigua, which destroyed the only possibility that was\u00a0defacto left to the Claimants in order to be redressed for the expropriation.\n352. In short, the implementation of the Decrees had the effect of neutralizing the\u00a0value of the Claimants' investment in Comsigua, by leaving their voting and\u00a0monetary rights associated with the investment devoid of any content.\nT., pp. 568-570.\n356T p. 569:4-22.\nPro memoria: IFC sold its 8.70% interest in Comsigua, Exhibit C-40; Exhibit C-82.\n90\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 93 of 201\n4.3 LACK OF PAYMENT\n353. Having determined that Venezuela indirectly expropriated the Claimants'\u00a0investment in Tavsa and Comsigua, the Arbitral Tribunal will need to determine\u00a0whether such expropriations were lawful.\n354. It is worth going over the content of the BITs at this point:\nArticle 4.1 of the Luxembourg BIT:\n\"Each Contracting Party undertakes not to adopt any measure of expropriation or nationalization or any other measure with the effect of\u00a0directly or indirectly dispossessing the investors of the other Contracting\u00a0Party of the investments belonging to them in its territory, unless the\u00a0following conditions are fulfilled:\na) the measures are adopted for reasons for public purpose or national\u00a0interest;\nb) the measures are adopted in accordance with legal procedures;\nc) they are neither discriminatory nor contrary to a specific commitment\u00a0concerning the treatment of an investment;\nd) they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of adequate and\u00a0effective compensation.\"\nArticle IV. 1 of the Portuguese BIT:\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take measures that deprive, directly or indirectly, the investors of the other Contracting Party of the investments\u00a0made by them, except if the following conditions are fulfilled:\na) that the measures are adopted for reasons of public purposes or national interest, in accordance with the legislation in force;\nb) that the measures are not discriminatory;\nc) that the measures are accompanied by provisions that guarantee the payment of immediate, adequate and effective compensation; this\u00a0compensation shall be based on the market value of the investment in\u00a0question immediately prior to the moment at which the measures was made\u00a0public; compensation will accrue interest at the exchange rate applicable at\u00a0the date in which the transaction becomes effective, in the territory where\u00a0the investment is located; the lawfulness of the referred measures and the\u00a0amount of compensation may be submitted for review pursuant to the\u00a0applicable legal procedure.\"\n355. In other words, the BITs provide, in equivalent terms, that a measure needs to be\u00a0accompanied by provisions for the payment of adequate and effective\u00a0compensation, to be made immediately, without undue delay.\n91\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 94 of 201\n356. One of the Claimants' core arguments is that, even though more than seven years\u00a0have elapsed since the expropriation,358 they have received no compensation at\u00a0all,359 in breach of Articles IV and 4 of the BITs.\n357. Prima facie, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants: a delay of more\u00a0than seven years in the payment of compensation does not constitute\u00a0\"immediate\" payment, in the words of Article IV of the Portuguese BIT.36\u00b0\u00a0Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT further requires that payment be made without\u00a0\"undue delay;\" and, in this case, Venezuela has wielded two excuses for the\u00a0delay, which the Tribunal will now analyze: the inexistence of a judgment\u00a0ordering payment of the fair price (A.); and the Claimants' obstruction tactics\u00a0(B.). Lastly, the Respondent also maintains, as a subsidiary argument, that the\u00a0lack of payment does not render the expropriation unlawful (C.).\nA. The Lack of a Judgment Ordering Payment\n358. The Bolivarian Republic admits that every expropriation goes hand in hand with\u00a0the obligation to pay compensation. It argues, however, that it has not paid any\u00a0such compensation because no judgment has been issued by the court in charge\u00a0of the expropriation proceedings ordering payment of the fair price.361\n359. This argument must fail.\n360. The judicial expropriation procedure is governed by Articles 23 et seq. of\u00a0LECUPS. To sum up, the contentious proceedings in place for expropriation are\u00a0as follows:\nThe expropriating entity files an expropriation request with the judge or magistrates362 (Article 23). The judicial authority sets a period for the\u00a0interested parties (Article 26) to be able to file their answer to the request\u00a0(Article 28), along with the relevant evidence (Article 30). Once the\u00a0evidentiary stage is complete, the judge will open the stage for presentation\u00a0of the case, to extend for no more than 60 days; the judge will then ask the\u00a0parties to submit their reports, and after that, within a period no to exceed 30\u00a0days, the judge will render judgment (Article 32) ruling on the need to\u00a0acquire all or a part of the property.\nOnce it has been ruled that it is necessary to expropriate, the judge will summon the parties to a conciliation hearing (Article 34) and, should no\u00a0settlement be reached, the judge will appoint a Valuation Commission to\u00a0determine the asset's fair price (Article 35). Once such fair price has been set,\u00a0the expropriating entity must deposit the sum with the court (Article 45).\u00a0Once the fair price has been deposited, the judge will issue a copy of the\u00a0expropriation judgment and order formal handover of the asset to the\u00a0requesting entity (Article 46).\n361. A judge may never order the expropriating entity to deposit the fair price value\n358 CV, para. 204.\nCV, paras. 201, 413.\n360 See also 01 European, para. 425.\n361 RVI, para. 138.\n362 The Civil Trial Court in the jurisdiction where the asset is located or the First Contentious -Administrative Court when the Republic is the party seeking expropriation (Article 23).\n92\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 95 of 201\nunless a judicial proceeding has been instituted. And, pursuant to Article 23 of LECUPS, such proceeding is commenced by the expropriating entity. In this\u00a0case, there is no evidence that the expropriating entity - the Bolivarian Republic\u00a0- has commenced any such proceeding. Therefore, Venezuela has not done the\u00a0bare minimum in order for a judgment to be rendered at some point ordering\u00a0payment of the fair price.\n362. The Bolivarian Republic may not escape its liability for an internationally\u00a0wrongful act by relying on its own inaction. 363\nVenezuela's Counter -Arguments\n363. The Bolivarian Republic has tried to sidestep the lack of a court proceeding by\u00a0attributing it:\n364. (i) Mainly, to the slow nature of the \"administrative handling\" of the issue.364\n365. The Claimants maintain that Venezuela has not even commenced the judicial\u00a0expropriation proceeding,365 and Venezuela has produced no evidence that would\u00a0refute such allegation. In order for a proceeding to be slow, it is necessary that,\u00a0at the very least, it has been commenced; in this case, however, rather than\u00a0slowness, there seems to be complete inaction on the part of Venezuela.\n366. (ii) Subsidiarily, to the investors' inaction.366\n367. Venezuela suggests it is the Claimants who should have initiated the expropriation proceeding, thereby making up for the inaction of the\u00a0Administration. The Bolivarian Republic argues that the Claimants could have\u00a0relied on Article 9 of the Organic Law on Administrative Litigation, under which\u00a0the contentious -administrative judicial organs may act in the event that an\u00a0authority fails to take a step they are statutorily required to take.367\n368. The Respondent further notes that other tribunals have taken into consideration\u00a0if the investors used the resources available to them under domestic law when\u00a0determining whether the State committed an international wrong.368\n369. The arguments are not convincing: Article 23 of LECUPS provides, without\u00a0exception, that it is the State who must institute the judicial expropriation\u00a0proceedings. Venezuela's suggestion that it should have been the Claimants who\u00a0started the judicial expropriation action against themselves makes absolutely no\u00a0sense: under Venezuelan law, every citizen is entitled to step in for the\u00a0Administration in the event of the latter's inaction, and institute contentious -administrative proceedings, but is under no obligation to do so.\n363 Nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria, which stems from the principle of good faith. This has been a well -established principle since the first relevant cases in Public International Law: Montijo, Roberts, Tattler, Chorz\u00f3w.\n3 T., p. 274:8-13; RV para. 138.\n365 CV, para. 206.\n366 T., p. 274:8-13; RV para. 138.\n367 Article 9.1: \"Contentious -Administrative organs shall have jurisdiction over the authorities' failure or refusal to\u00a0produce an act they are by law required to produce.\"\n368 RV, para. 135.\n93\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 96 of 201\nB. The Claimants' Alleged Obstruction\n370. The State's second argument is that it was the Claimants who hindered each and\u00a0every conciliation effort attempted by Venezuela in connection with the payment\u00a0of compensation:\na. Tavsa's Compensation\n371. The Respondent argues that, by sending the Tavsa Notice and subsequently\u00a0instituting this arbitration, Tenaris thwarted any negotiation attempt. 369\n372. Said argument is not reasonable.\n373. Negotiating compensation was the only task entrusted to the Compensation\u00a0Commission, which consisted of members appointed by the State and by\u00a0Tenaris. The Compensation Commission was tasked with aniving at a\u00a0compensation solution within a period of 60 days, which could be extended for\u00a0another 60 days upon the parties' mutual agreement.37\u00b0 Until the negotiation\u00a0period had ended, the State could not take over control and the exclusive\u00a0operation of Tavsa, as per Article 5 of the Implementing Decree. 371\n374. In actuality, the State appointed its members on August 7, 2009,372 and Tenaris\u00a0did as much 10 days later.373 With the first 60 -day negotiation period having\u00a0expired unsuccessfully, on October 28, 2009 the State requested that the period\u00a0be extended to December 29, 2009. However, well before this extension\u00a0expired, and without waiting for a compensation agreement, the Government\u00a0forcefully took over Tavsa.375\n375. Four days after takeover, the Claimant sent the Tavsa Notice, making the\nBolivarian Republic aware of the existence of a dispute between them.\n376. Given the evidence on the record, it is the Arbitral Tribunal's view that the\u00a0Tavsa Notice and the failure of the negotiations are a consequence of the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic's decision to prematurely take over Tavsa.\n369 T., pp. 249:19-250:6.\n\u00b0 Article S of the Implementing Decree.\n371 \"Upon expiry of the period established in the preceding article without an agreement for the transformation into a State-owned company having been reached, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, acting through the Ministries or\u00a0any of its functionally -decentralized entities, referred to in Article 2 hereof, shall assume, as applicable, the\u00a0exclusive control and operation of the companies, in order to maintain continuity in the activities carried out by the\u00a0companies referred to in Article 1. In the event that no agreement is reached in the negotiations over the assets, the\u00a0National Executive Branch shall decree the expropriation of said companies, pursuant to the provisions of the Law\u00a0on Expropriation by Reason of Public or Social Interest. In no event shall lost profits or indirect damage be taken into\u00a0account for the calculation of compensation or the fair price of the aforementioned assets.\"\n372 Letter from PDVSA to Tavsa, August 7, 2009, Exhibit C-69.

See Letter from Tenaris to\u00a0PDVSA Industrial, August 17, 2009, Exhibit C-70, pp. 1-2; Alvarez, para. 58.

Comsigua's Compensation\n377. The negotiations over Comsigua's compensation went on much further than\u00a0Tavsa's. Indeed, the Bolivarian Republic even made the Claimants an offer on\u00a0terms equal to those offered to the Japanese Shareholders.376 This offer was even\u00a0put down in writing, since its materialization required ministerial approval.377\n378. Each Party has an entirely different recollection of why this offer did not\u00a0succeed:\nWitness Wilfredo Villarroel, Comsigua's Coordinator of Administration starting June 2011,378 claims that Tenaris suddenly made the possibility of\u00a0an agreement regarding Comsigua conditional upon a global agreement\u00a0covering compensation for Matesi379 (another HBI manufacturer that was\u00a0nationalized)380 as well;\nFor his part, Ricardo Prosperi, Tenaris' General Manager for the Andean Region since February 2010,381 states that Tenaris was willing to accept the\u00a0offer made in connection with Comsigua, and attributes the offer freeze to\u00a0the change in the Ministry in charge of handling the negotiations (MIBAM\u00a0to the Ministry of the People's Power for Energy) and a family tragedy\u00a0suffered by a high Government official.382\n379. Having carefully examined the testimony and expert evidence produced in this\u00a0case, the Arbitral Tribunal is inclined to recognize greater probative value to the\u00a0Claimants' witness, as it is not for nothing that he is the witness who was\u00a0directly involved in the events.383\n380. The Tribunal thus finds that the negotiations were frustrated due to reasons\u00a0outside the Claimants' control.\n381. The Respondent's excuses for its lack of payment having been rejected, there is\u00a0still one subsidiary argument that remains to be analyzed: the mere lack of\u00a0payment of compensation does not render the expropriation unlawful.\nC. Payment as a BIT-Comnliance Element for the Exnronriation\n382. According to Venezuela, what is decisive for an international wrong is not\u00a0whether the State paid compensation or instituted court proceedings to assess\u00a0such compensation,384 but whether provisions were in place in order for\n376 R-68.\nCRED-59.\n378 Villarroel I, p. 1.\nMatesi Materiales Sider\u00fcrgicos S.A.\n380 Villarroel I, para. 1213.\n381 Prosperi, para. 5.\n382 Prosperi, paras. 22 - 25.\n383 Prosperi, paras. 22 et seq.; T., p. 764:18.\n384 Rh, para. 304.\n95\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 98 of 201\ncompensation to be promptly made,385 which is what is required by Article 4.1(d) of the Luxembourg BIT.386 The Respondent relies on Amoco387 in support\u00a0of its position.\n383. The Luxembourg BIT distinguishes the requirement that provisions be included\u00a0in the relevant law or decree that guarantee payment of compensation, on the one\u00a0hand, from the obligation that payment of compensation be effected without\u00a0undue delay, on the other:\nProvisions on the payment of compensation:\nArticle 4.1.d) of the Luxembourg BIT: \"[.1 they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of adequate and effective compensation.\"\nPayment of compensation:\nArticle 4.2 of the Luxembourg BIT: \"... Compensations shall be paid without undue delay and shall be freely transferrable.\"\n384. Accordingly, Venezuela's position is unacceptable: the Republic cannot avoid\u00a0the consequences of its lack of payment by relying upon the mere existence of\u00a0expropriation measures that did make provision for the payment of\u00a0compensation. What is relevant here is not that the legislative measure provides\u00a0for the right to compensation, but that it has been effectively satisfied.\n385. Inespective of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal has analyzed the Amoco case,\u00a0which the Respondent relies on in support of its position, and finds that the facts\u00a0of that case are entirely unrelated to the case at hand:\nIn Amoco, the Iranian law that governed expropriation processes burdened the affected party with initiating the mandatory administrative proceedings\u00a0to claim for compensation.388 According to such law, there was no need to\u00a0involve any judicial authority.389 The Arbitral Tribunal found that the legal\u00a0provisions that governed payment of compensation were adequate, with\u00a0judicial involvement not being necessary,39\u00b0 and that the claimant had just\u00a0elected not to be involved in that proceeding and not to claim\u00a0compensation in the administrative proceedings.391\nThis case is completely different: Venezuelan law provides that the expropriation proceedings are to take place before a judicial authority,\u00a0instituted by the expropriating entity; therefore, the judge's involvement is\u00a0a result of its own law, and it was the State (not the Claimants) who,\u00a0disregarding its legal obligation to institute the judicial expropriation\u00a0proceedings, frustrated the possibility that a judge would order payment of\u00a0fair price.\n385 Rh, para. 300.\n386 Rh, para. 298.\n387 Exhibit RLA-84.\n388 Amoco, paras. 134, 137.\n389 Amoco, para. 137.\n390 Amoco, para. 137.\n391 Amoco, paras. 76, 134.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 99 of 201\n386. To sum up, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the expropriation of Tavsa's and\u00a0Comsigua's assets entailed a violation of Articles IV and 4 of the BITs, as\u00a0Venezuela failed to fulfill its obligation to pay compensation without undue\u00a0delay.\n97\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 100 of 201\nVII. OUANTUM\n387. Having concluded that Venezuela expropriated the Claimants' investments in\u00a0Tavsa and Comsigua in violation of Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT and\u00a0Article IV of the Portuguese BIT, the Tribunal must now address the issue of\u00a0quantum.\n388. The decision, as regards the compensation quantum, is as follows: the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal will address the relevant valuation date as a preliminary issue (VI.1.); it\u00a0will then determine the value of each of the expropriated companies: Tavsa\u00a0(VI.2.) and Comsigua (VI.3.). Lastly, it will make a decision on the subject of\u00a0interest (VI.4.).\n389. Prior to that, however, a few paragraphs are in order as an introduction.\nThe Parties' Positions\n390. The Claimants have requested the following relief:\n\"That the Tnbrnialj\n(c) ORDER Venezuela to pay the Claimants the sum of US$243.7 million\u00a0(as of April 30, 2008) for its breaches of the Treaties, which includes the\u00a0sum of US$213.2 million in respect of Tenaris's investment in Tavsa and\u00a0US$30.5 million in respect of Claimants' investment in Comsigua, or such\u00a0other sum as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation;\n(d) ORDER Venezuela to pay pre -award interest on (c) above in the sum of\u00a0US$471.1 million from the Valuation Date to September 11, 2015 at a rate\u00a0of 15.69% (being the WACC of Tavsa, amounting to US$410.77 million)\u00a0and 15.96% (being the WACC of Comsigua, amounting to US$60.35\u00a0million) per amrnm and thereafter until the date of the Tnbunal' s Award,\u00a0compounded annually, or at such other rate and compounding period as the\u00a0Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation;\n(e) ORDER Venezuela to pay post -award interest on (c) and (d) at a rate of\u00a015.69% (being the WACC of Tavsa) and 15.96% (being the WACC of\u00a0Comsigua) per annum as at the date of the Tribunal's Award, compounded\u00a0annually, or at such other rate and compounding period as the Tribunal\u00a0determines will ensure full reparation.\"\n391. In other words, the Claimants are seeking to be paid the value of their\ninvestments in Tavsa and Comsigua, plus pre- and post -Award interest.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 101 of 201\n392. Venezuela, on the other hand, argues that the Claimants have not satisfied their\u00a0burden of proof as regards the quantum of the damages.392\nApplicable Law\n393. The consequences associated with a violation of Articles 4 of the Luxembourg\u00a0BIT and IV of the Portuguese BIT are provided for in the articles themselves:\n\"The amornit of the compensation shall correspond to the real value of the investment concerned on the day prior to the adoption or publication of the\u00a0measures.\"393\n\"[..J TJhis compensation shall be based on the market value of the investment in question immediately prior to the moment at which the\u00a0measures was made public.\"394\n394. Thus, both BITs require that the quantum of compensation be equal to the \"real\u00a0value\" and the \"market value\" of the expropriated asset, calculated on the date\u00a0immediately preceding that on which the expropriation took place (or was made\u00a0public). The Parties agree that the terms \"real value\" and \"market value\" are\u00a0equivalent395 and refer to the money price a hypothetical buyer would be willing\u00a0to pay a hypothetical seller, where\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both parties are interested in completing the transaction, but not required\nto do so;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both parties are acting in good faith, in accordance with market practices;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an open, unrestricted market; and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both parties have reasonable knowledge of the subject -matter of the\ncontract and the market conditions.396\n395. In addition, the Claimants have asserted their right to full reparation, which is\u00a0the compensation standard under international Law.\n396. It is an undisputed principle of customary international Law that the victim of a\u00a0wrongful act of the State is entitled to receive full reparation, as if the wrongful\u00a0act had never taken place.397 In expropriation cases, full reparation equals the\u00a0market value of the expropriated assets, taken to mean the value the owner of the\u00a0assets could have obtained, had the assets been sold on a date immediately\u00a0preceding that of the State's taking, or the date when the intention to expropriate\u00a0became public knowledge (causing the assets' market value to fall).398\n392 RIV, para. 338.\nLuxembourg BIT, Article 4.2.\nPortuguese BIT, Article IV.1.c).\nCIV, para. 203, RIV, paras. 342 et seq.\n396 CI, para. 180.\nChorz\u00f3w, p. 47.

Therefore, in practical terms, the rules on compensation established in the BITs\u00a0lead to the same results as the application of the general principles of\u00a0international Law.399\nEvidence of the Market Value of Tavsa and Coms\n398. Evidence of the quantum of compensation has been very abundant: it covers\u00a0close to 500 pages, more than 250 exhibits, along with spreadsheets, tables and\u00a0charts and one day and a half of expert witness examinations. Of such evidence,\u00a0the most important piece is, without question, the expert reports:\nThe Claimants have hired the services of Messrs. Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo D. Lopez Zadicoff of COMPASS LEXECON, LLC\u00a0['Abdala/Zadicoff\"I, who submitted two expert reports - one of October\u00a018, 2013 ['Abdala/Zadicoff I\" and another one of January 27, 2015\u00a0['Abdala/Zadicoff II\"I;\nVenezuela, on the other hand, entrusted Mr. Timothy H. Hart of CREDIBILITY INTERNATIONAL ['Hart\"I with quantifying the damage; the expert also\u00a0submitted two reports: one of October 21, 2014 \"Hart I\" and another one of\u00a0April 13, 2015 \"Hart II\".\nThen, on August 21, 2015, both Parties' experts jointly prepared an additional report on the value of Tavsa, focusing on those aspects on which\u00a0their positions diverged ['Joint Report\"I, which was submitted along with\u00a0a spreadsheet containing several expandable interactive options to allow the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal to be able to opt between the suggestions of one or the\u00a0other expert.\n399. The Arbitral Tribunal warns that, given the scale of the allegation and evidence\u00a0on the subject of damages, the Tribunal's summaries of the experts' positions are\u00a0not intended to be exhaustive. In order to make this the easiest explanation to\u00a0follow, the Arbitral Tribunal has elected to highlight here just those arguments it\u00a0has found most significant, which does not mean it has not carefully analyzed\u00a0everything that has been submitted to it by the experts.\nThe Tribunal takes note of the fact that Venezuela argues that the applicable standard to calculate the compensation due is contained in the BITs themselves (RVI, paras. 162 et seq.), while it is the Claimants' contention that the applicable\u00a0compensation standard is the one provided by customary international Law (CVI, para. 226). However, both Parties agree\u00a0that, for the main damages quantum, the result would be the same irrespective of which standard is used.

The Claimants have submitted their petitum jointly: Venezuela must pay both\u00a0Claimants the sum of USD 213.2 million for Tenaris' investment in Talta and\u00a0USD 30.5 million for both Claimants' investment in Comsigua; it must also pay\u00a0both Claimants the interest already accrued and to accrue on those amounts.\u00a0However, the Claimants have not specified the proportion in which such award\u00a0will be allocated between them.\n401. The Arbitral Tribunal has ruled out a 50%/50% allocation, since this would\u00a0allow Talta, which is not an investor in Tavsa, to be paid compensation for the\u00a0expropriation of an investment that is not its own. The appropriate solution is for\u00a0each company's compensation to go to the respective investor.\n402. Tavsa's compensation is then to be paid in full to Tenaris. Comsigua's compensation, however, creates more serious doubts. Both Claimants are\u00a0investors in Comsigua: Talta is the direct investor, and Tenaris is also an\u00a0investor but only indirectly, as it is the 100% owner of Talta: the complaint\u00a0could have been filed individually, either by Talta or by Tenaris. Because it was\u00a0jointly filed, and no allegation has been made by a party, the Tribunal does not\u00a0have a rule to determine how to allocate the compensation among them;\u00a0therefore, the award will be paid to the direct investor in Comsigua, namely\u00a0Talta. Tenaris, as Talta's sole owner, will then do as it sees fit with the money\u00a0thus received.\n101\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 104 of 201\nVII.!.\n  \nTHE VALUATION DATE  \n403. Both BITs establish that compensation is to be set as of the day preceding that\u00a0on which the expropriatory measure became public knowledge.40\u00b0\n404. The Parties' experts have conflicting positions on the date of the expropriatory\u00a0measure: the Claimants' experts argue that expropriation took place on the date\u00a0of the Nationalization Decree, April 30, 2008; whereas the Respondent's expert\u00a0advocates for May 20, 2009, which is the day prior to the public announcement\u00a0of Tavsa's and Comsigua's nationalization by President Chavez.\n1. TAVSA\n405. As regards Tavsa, the Respondent itself has acknowledged that the expropriation\u00a0was canied out pursuant to the Nationalization Decree, as supplemented by the\u00a0Implementing Decree;401 there is then no question that the expropriatory measure\u00a0took place on April 30, 2008.\nThe Respondent's Counter -Argument\n406. The Respondent's expert has argued that Tenaris, in its filings with the U.S.\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission, suggested that the date on which, for\u00a0accounting purposes, its investment in Venezuela was affected was May 2009.402\n407. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff, however, consider that the fact that Tenaris waited\u00a0until May 2009 to have its financial statements reflect the situation of its\u00a0investments in Venezuela is not significant in order to determine the valuation\u00a0date, due to a number of reasons:403\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until the formal change of control of the company took place, there was no\nobligation to reclassify the investment;404\nThe book value of Tenaris' investments in Venezuela did not reflect their market value, and there was thus no need to reduce the book value of its\u00a0investments; therefore, the fact that in May 2009 they decided to have their\u00a0accounts reflect this impairment in value only shows that Tenaris is guided\u00a0by prudence; it does not, however, rule out the fact that the investments\u00a0had already been impaired earlier.\n408. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Tenaris:\n400\n401\n402\n403\n  \nLuxembourg BIT, Article 4.2, and Portuguese BIT, Article IV.1(c). RIlI, paras. 284 et seq.\nHart I, para. 70.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 18.\nT., p. 827.\n102\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 105 of 201\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because nowhere do the BITs link the determination of the date for\ncompensation to the investors' accounting records; and\n- Second, because the Claimants have supplied two plausible reasons for such accounting behavior, which is not incompatible with the fact that the\u00a0expropriation took place a year earlier.\n409. The Arbitral Tribunal confirms that the Nationalization Decree of April 30, 2008\u00a0was a measure with expropriatory effects on Tavsa and, therefore, in accordance\u00a0with the literal meaning of the BITs, the valuation date for the compensation due\u00a0is the day before the date of that measure, i.e. April 29, 2008.\n410. However, because using full months for calculation purposes is more convenient, the Claimants' experts have used as the valuation date a day later,\u00a0April 30, 2008, and the Arbitral Tribunal will allow this simplification (which\u00a0results in a very slight reduction in value).\n2. COMSIGUA\n411. As regards Comsigua, conversely to the case with Tavsa, Venezuela has not\u00a0explicitly acknowledged its expropriation. It has been this Arbitral Tribunal that\u00a0determined that both companies shared a similar fate: their assets were\u00a0expropriated as a result of the Nationalization Decree and the Implementing\u00a0Decree.405 Therefore, the date of publication of the expropriation measure is, just\u00a0like for Tavsa, April 29, 2008 and, due to reasons of convenience, it will be\u00a0April 30, 2008.\nThe Respondent's Counter -Argument\n412. Venezuela argues that the Nationalization Decree does not apply to Comsigua,\u00a0because it is not Comsigua, but Sidor instead, that it mentions explicitly.406 This\u00a0argument is not persuasive:\n413. (i) The Nationalization Decree ordered the nationalization of the entire iron ore\u00a0transformation industry in the Guayana region - the sector Comsigua operates\u00a0in;\n414. (ii) The Nationalization Decree ruled the activities of Sidor \"and its subsidiaries\u00a0and affiliates\" to be of public use and social interest, and ordered its\u00a0transformation into a State -Owned Company.\n415. The Arbitral Tribunal has no doubt that Comsigua was an affiliate of Sidor\u00a0because, as agreed by the Respondent itself, \"affiliates\" are those companies that\u00a0are subject to common ownership,407 and, in this case, Comsigua was an affiliate\u00a0of Sidor, as it was owned by Tenaris and Sidor was owned by Ternium, and both\u00a0Tenaris and Ternium are members of the Techint Group408 - the ultimate parent\u00a0of both was therefore the same.\n405 See para. 336 supra.\n406 RIlI, para. 288.\nRIV, para. 355, and the reference to Exhibit R-109.\n408 CI, para. 58.\n103\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 106 of 201\n416. (iii) The Respondent itself acknowledged on several occasions that the\u00a0Nationalization Decree applies to Comsigua:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The MIBAM Minister appointed its representatives to the Compensation\nCommission, relying expressly on the Nationalization Decree:409\n\"In my capacity as Minister of MIBAMJ and based on Decree No. 6058 . .J and pursuant to the President's decision to proceed with the\u00a0full statization of Complejo Sider\u00fcrgico de Guayana S.A. (Comsigua)\u00a0I1...1.\"\n- Respondent's witness Villarroel, an advisor to the Compensation Commission, acknowledged the following facts:41\u00b0\n\"In May 2009, following the decision to nationalize COMSIGUA and in accordance with Legal Decree 6.058 of April 30, 2008, a [.1\u00a0transition commission was created [.1.\"\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The share sale agreement between the State and the Japanese Shareholders\nmentions both the Nationalization Decree and the Implementing Decree as the legislation under which the sale transaction was being canied out:411\n\"[. .1 an agreement has been reached to enter into this share sale contract, pursuant to Decrees Nos. 6058 and 6796 [.1.\"\nIn this arbitration, Venezuela has admitted that Tavsa's expropriation took place as a result of the Nationalization Decree,412 even though, as regards\u00a0the applicability of the Decree, Tavsa and Comsigua are similar\u00a0companies: they are both companies in the Guayana iron and steel sector,\u00a0they are both owned by Tenaris, and therefore affiliates of Sidor, and they\u00a0both had their Takeover Commissions created based on the Nationalization\u00a0Decree.413 There is then no reason to accept the applicability of the Decree\u00a0to Tavsa and - arbitrarily - deny such applicability to Comsigua.\n417. Venezuela cannot now act in a manner inconsistent with its own previous\u00a0actions414 and claim that the Nationalization Decree does not apply to Comsigua.\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal is reaffirmed that the valuation date for the\u00a0purpose of Comsigua's compensation is set by the Nationalization Decree, i.e.\u00a0April 30, 2008.\n409 Exhibit C-57.\n410 Villarroel I, para. 3.\n411 Exhibit C-72.\n412 RV, para. 132: \"Venezuela has explained that the measure [occupation of Tavsa' s premisesi was authorized by Decree\u00a06058 [.1.\"\n413 See para. 262 supra.\n414 The principle of non yen ire contra factum proprium, in Roman law tradition, or estoppel, in the common-law tradition.\u00a0104\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 107 of 201\nVII.2.\n  \nTAVSA'S VALUE\n418. The Arbitral Tribunal will now summarize the Claimant's position (1.), and the\u00a0Respondent's position (2.), and, lastly, it will make a decision as to the value of\u00a0Tavsa (3.).\n1. THE CLAIMANT'S VALUATION\n419. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff have estimated the value of Tavsa using a DCF\u00a0approach (1.), and compared it using market multiples (2.). The experts prefer\u00a0the former method, as it best reflects the income -generating capacity of the asset\u00a0that is being valued.415 In any event, the results anived at by the two methods are\u00a0similar and stand in the ballpark of USD 300 million,416 valued as of April 30,\u00a02008.\n1.1 DCF\n420. Basically, this valuation approach consists in:417 estimating the future revenue\u00a0stream (A.) and deducting expenses off it (B.). The experts assume that the net\u00a0cash flows will be generated in perpetuity, increasing from 2017 onwards at a\u00a0growth rate (C.). The cash flows are discounted at the appropriate discount rate\u00a0(D.) to the valuation date.418\n421. It should be noted here that the DCF method is not about estimating the cash\u00a0flows actually received by Tavsa after being expropriated, but about estimating,\u00a0with the knowledge available as of the valuation date (when the expropriation\u00a0became public knowledge), the income to be obtained and costs to be incuned in\u00a0coming years.\nA. Revenue\n422. Tavsa's revenue is determined by:419 the expected volume of production of\u00a0seamless steel tubes (a.) multiplied by their projected price (b.).\na. Tube Production\n423. AbdalalZadicoff state that, as of the expropriation date, Tavsa's annual\u00a0production capacity was 80,000 tons of tubes,42\u00b0 and they estimate that, between\u00a02008 and 2010, annual production would progressively increase to reach up to\u00a072,000 tons; this maximum production level means that Tavsa would be\u00a0producing at maximum capacity, at a utilization rate of 90% (80,000 \\* 90% =\u00a072,000), as budgeted for 2008 - 2009.421\n415 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 8. Unless otherwise indicated, the Tribunal refers to the English language report.\u00a0416 Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table I.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, paras. 56, and 112.\n418 The determination of the valuation date is addressed in a separate section.\n419 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 118.\n420 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 123.\n421 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 124.\n105\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 108 of 201\n424. According to experts Abdala/Zadicoff, this estimate is completely reasonable:\u00a0Tavsa's production constantly expanded between 2002 and 2007, with the\u00a0company more than doubling its initial production levels. Once the 2006 and\u00a02007 conflicts were over, the experts are convinced that the growth rate would\u00a0have been greater still, in line with Tavsa's management's expectations.422 A\u00a0production level of 72,000 tons per year is what management expected for 2008\u00a0and 2009, and it matches the production level reached in the first quarter of\u00a02007 423\n425. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff start from the premise that Tavsa would obtain the\u00a0necessary inputs to attain such production levels, and do not doubt the credibility\u00a0of this hypothesis: Tavsa would require 91,000 tons of ingots per year, a quantity\u00a0greater than provided for in the contract with Sidor by only 1%; this 1% could be\u00a0obtained from the stock Tavsa had piled up as of the valuation date.424\n426. Abdala/Zadicoff do not find it necessary to apply greater adjustments to these\u00a0forecasts to reflect potential supervening production problems, as they contend it\u00a0is a basic feature of the DCF method to predict the best cash flow scenario and\u00a0reflect residual risks through the discount rate.425\n427. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff assert that Tavsa would be able to sell 100% of its\u00a0production since it was and continues to be the only seamless tube manufacturer in\u00a0Venezuela - a country with significant demand for this product.426 As of the\u00a0valuation date, PDVSA would acquire basically 100% of production - in line\u00a0with the nationalization of the oil and gas sector427 - and there are no reasons to\u00a0assume that this trend would change.428\nb. Projected Price\n(i) May -December 2008\n428. For the period May -December 2008, experts Abdala/Zadicoff use real sale prices\u00a0(USD 2,350 per ton), since there was a significant backlog of orders as of the\u00a0valuation date.429\n422 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 25.\u00a0423 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 27.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 28. 425 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 29.\u00a0426 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 30.\u00a0427 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 33.\u00a0428 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 32.\u00a0429 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 3 8(a).\n106\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 109 of 201\n(ii) 2009-2013\n429. As of the time of the expropriation, Tavsa would sell almost its entire production\u00a0to the state-owned PDVSA.\n430. The price agreement with PDVSA that was in place until 2008 provided that the\u00a0sales price would be set on the basis of the price applied in the previous period,\u00a0adjusted on a monthly basis per fluctuations in the international reference prices.\u00a0However, given the upward trend in such international prices, in 2008 PDVSA\u00a0and Tavsa started to negotiate a new pricing system that would cushion the impact\u00a0of international price fluctuations P430\n431. The proposed pricing formula (which would end up being accepted that very\u00a0same year) was as follows:431\nIPPL\\_L\n= 30 % X P1 +70% xP\\_1 xiLPPLt\\_\nwhere:\nPt is the price in month t\nPt-i is the price in month t-1\nPPLtJ is the reference price published by Pipe Logix for month t-1 PPLt2 is the reference price published by Pipe Logix for month t-2\n432. This formula means that international prices (PPL) are weighed at 70%.\n433. Even though, as of the valuation date, the above formula was still in the process\u00a0of being negotiated, the experts use the assumption that Tavsa would have\u00a0introduced this pricing mechanisms in its new contracts with PDVSA (de facto,\u00a0its sole customer432) starting in 2009; and they thus apply said formula to\u00a0estimate the future sales price.\n434. The difficulty in applying the formula to obtain a long-term estimate is that Pipe\u00a0Logix (a provider of market information for pipes434) does not post price\u00a0predictions for periods beyond one year ahead. Therefore, experts\u00a0Abdala/Zadicoff chose to substitute the Pipe Logix prices with those posted by\u00a0Metal Bulletin Research for hot rolled coils ['HRC\"I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The experts highlight\nthe fact that, historically, the seamless steel tube prices published by Pipe Logix and HRC prices have evolved at the same pace.436\n(iii) 2013-2017\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 119.\n431 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 120.\n432 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 40.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 121.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 119 and footnote 114.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 121.\n436 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 42.\n107\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 110 of 201\n435. From 2013 on, the experts estimate that prices will evolve in line with the U.S.\u00a0producer price index ['PPI\"I\n436. Abdala/Zadicoff do not accept the criticism (discussed further below) that their\u00a0price forecasts do nothing but extend the pricing bubble that existed in late 2007\u00a0and early 2008. The experts' counter -argument is that their forecast (based on\u00a0the projections by other analysts in this sector) estimates an initial price increase,\u00a0followed by a fall, as was predictable as of the valuation date.438\nB. ExDenditures\n437. In order to derive a cash flow, the experts deduct operating expenses (opex) (a.),\u00a0taxes (b.), and capital expenditures (capex) (c.) and apply adjustments to reflect\u00a0changes in working capital (d.).\na. Opex\n438. Production costs consist of the materials required to manufacture the tubes, as\u00a0well as the energy consumed in the production process.439 Supplies (including\u00a0electricity and gas)44\u00b0 came fully from Sidor, and the contract with this company\u00a0established the applicable price, which was to be reviewed every two years. The\u00a0experts estimated that the prices of these supplies would evolve as follows:\nSteel billets and related supplies, based on the expected evolution of the HRC price;441 the experts note that it is standard practice to provide for a\u00a0certain decrease in the costs of steel, in line with the reduction in Tavsa's\u00a0;442\nrevenue\nThe costs of other materials, as well as the costs of energy, based on the 2007 costs in boilvares, adjusted as per the expected evolution of the\u00a0Venezuelan PPI.443\n439. As regards the costs of the production plant personnel, these evolve in line with\u00a0the Venezuelan consumer price index ['CPI\"I The experts further note that,\u00a0if tube production were estimated below 72,000 tons per year, there would be a\u00a0lower number of personnel and labor costs should be reduced.445\n438\n441\n442\n  \nAbdala/Zadicoff I, footnote 117.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 43.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 127.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, footnote 124.\n  \nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 130.

The commercial costs category covers a whole range of costs:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taxes: Tavsa's revenue is subject to two different taxes: a tax on invoicing\nand the so-called \"social contribution;\"446\n- Freight and extraordinary expenses, which would evolve based on the Venezuelan PPI ;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Administrative staff expenses, estimated at the 2007 sum, increased by the\nVenezuelan CPI.448\n441. As to technical assistance costs, experts Abdala/Zadicoff found it reasonable to\u00a0estimate that, in 2008, Tavsa would have no longer required this type of support\u00a0services.449 In the preceding 10 years, Tavsa and Tamsa had been bound by a\u00a0technical assistance contract45\u00b0 that expired in 2008. Tavsa would have chosen\u00a0not to renew that contract, thereby saving on this additional cost.\n442. In the Joint Report, experts Abdala/Zadicoff introduce the following nuance: the\u00a0technical assistance contract would have generated a revenue stream for Tamsa\u00a0(and, therefore, for Tenaris), which it was deprived of as a result of the\u00a0expropriation. Therefore, if the hypothesis that the contract was cancelled is\u00a0rejected, the contract would remain in force and Tamsa would have been\u00a0deprived of such revenue and, therefore, they would be seeking separate\u00a0compensation for Tenaris for the loss of such contract.451\nb. Taxes\n443. Tavsa's income is subject to three different taxes: on science and technology\u00a0(0.5% of gross income), anti -drug tax (1% of EBIT minus interest) and corporate\u00a0income tax (34% net of the anti -drug tax).452\nC. Capex\n444. The estimation of capital expenditures is marked by the hypothesis that Tavsa\u00a0will not be increasing its production capacity. Hence, the only costs that are\u00a0expected are those related to the depreciation of fixed assets, to maintain the preestablished maximum capacity.453 The experts note that they have had the cost\u00a0items include extraordinary repairs, totaling USD 3.1 million per year, thus\u00a0keeping Tavsa from having to invest additional amounts.454\n446 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 134.

In their second report, following the criticisms of expert Hart, the experts\u00a0decided to introduce a change to increase depreciation levels from 2017\u00a0onwards, such that these have now changed from USD 0.6 to 1.5 million.455\nd. Changes in Working Capital\n446. The Claimants' experts have looked at the 2005 - 2007 period, and determined\u00a0that trade receivables amount, on average, to 70 days' revenue, while accounts\u00a0payable are estimated as 70 days over total yearly expenses. Inventory is\u00a0calculated as 100 days of costs of goods sold.456\n447. Applying the above estimates, working capital stands at 10 days of annual\nrevenue.457\nC. Terminal Value\n448. Terminal value is estimated as the value of the 2017 revenue stream, increased at 2.4% in perpetuity. The 2.4% growth rate is consistent with U.S. inflation\u00a0expectations.458 Non -discounted terminal value is almost USD 350 million.459\u00a0This means 30% of the total enterprise value.460\nD. Discount Rate\n449. The discount rate used by the experts is the WACC, as per the following\nformula:461\nWACC=WDkD(l-t)\u00b1WEkE\nwhere:\nWD is the weight of debt financing in the capital structure\nkD is the cost of debt\nWE is the weight of equity in the capital structure\nkE is the cost of equity\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 58.\n456 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 142.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 143.\n458 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 144.\nCLEX-2, FCF, Terminal Value without the discount factor. 460T p. 974:12-13.\n461 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 170.\n110\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 113 of 201\n450. Next is a summary of the experts' estimates for each one of the above\nparameters:\na. Return on Equity\n451. This cost is calculated, per the CAPM,462 as the sum of the rate of return on risk -free assets (i.), the country -risk rate (ii.) and the product of the beta factor (iv.)\u00a0by the market risk premium (v.).463 According to the Claimants' experts, no size\u00a0premium is to be included (iii.). The return on equity is, as per the experts,\u00a017.8%.464 Each component will be addressed separately:\n(i) Rate of Return on Risk -Free Assets\n452. In practice, this rate is measured based on the yield of either 10 -year or 30 -year\u00a0U.S. bonds. The experts used 10 -year bonds, as these represent a long-term\u00a0investment and are less sensitive to unexpected inflation changes.465\n453. The average yield of these bonds, calculated on the basis of bonds maturing in\u00a0the 12 months up to April 30, 2008, is 4.29%.466\n(ii) Market Risk Premium\n454. The goal is to measure the additional returns an investment needs to yield as a\u00a0result of the investor taking on a risk higher than the risk entailed by a risk -free\u00a0investment.467\n455. The experts have estimated this premium based on the historical 1928 - 2007\u00a0indexes published by Prof. Damodaran468 and calculating the geometric average,\u00a0which is Abdala/Zadicoff advocate for the use of a geometric average\u00a0over an arithmetic average, as the latter is normally used only for short-term\u00a0projects.47\u00b0\n456. The experts contend that the premium calculated in this manner is in the range\u00a0of, or even slightly above, what experts recommend (about 3 5%) 471\n462 Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n463 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 173.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 191. 465 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 176.\u00a0466 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 176.\u00a0467 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 177.\u00a0468 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 98.\u00a0469 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 177.\n\u00b0 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 94.\n' Abdala/Zadicoff II, paras. 95, 96.\n111\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 114 of 201\n(iii) No Need for a Size Premium\n457. In the view of Abdala/Zadicoff, adding a premium to account for Tavsa's size is\u00a0not advisable, for several reasons:472\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, there is disagreement amongst authors as to the need to apply a size\npremium, even for companies in the U.S., let alone for companies outside of that country;473\nSecond, Tavsa is a company that can be considered very large for the Venezuelan market; the fact that it is a small company relative to U.S.\u00a0companies is something that is already reflected in the country -risk\u00a0premium.\n(iv) Beta\n458. Beta is the coefficient that reflects the company's profits' volatility relative to\u00a0market risk. Therefore, information on beta coefficients is obtained from a stock\u00a0market analysis; however, in the experts' opinion, stock market information\u00a0from emerging economies should not be used, as it tends to increase the beta as a\u00a0consequence of its volatility and unreliability.474 Therefore, the experts\u00a0recommend estimating the beta based on data for comparable companies\u00a0operating in a developed economy, as the U.S. economy, and applying the\u00a0required adjustment to reflect that the investment in question is an investment in\u00a0a developing economy, with higher economic and political volatility, and to\u00a0reflect specific regulatory features\n459. The experts have chosen Morningstar SIC code 331, which includes companies\u00a0in steel works, blast furnaces and rolling and finishing mills.476 The beta that is\u00a0derived through simple regression between the share return and the market return\u00a0is a \"raw\" beta, to which the experts apply a \"reversion -to -one\" adjustment.477\u00a0This adjustment is due to the belief that, in the long term, all projects should tend\u00a0to behave like the market, with, therefore, a beta of one;478 and the applicable\u00a0formula is as follows:479\nAdjusted Beta = 0.67 x Raw Beta \u00b1 0.33\n460. A second adjustment also needs to be applied, to unleverage the betas of\u00a0companies in the sample and releverage them,48\u00b0 using an optimal capital\u00a0structure for the relevant industries and the tax rate applicable in Venezuela\u00a0(34%)481 The result is a beta of 1.86.482\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 101.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 102.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 178.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 179.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 180.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 181.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, footnote 157.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 181.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 182.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 183.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 183.\n112\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 115 of 201\n(v) Country Risk Premium\n461. This premium represents the additional return an investor will ask for to invest in\u00a0a company in Venezuela as compared to a company in a more stable economy\u00a0like, for instance, the U.S.483\n462. The approach used by the experts to calculate this premium is the sovereign debt\u00a0approach. The experts thus compare the spread between the yield of 5 -year\u00a0USD-denominated Venezuelan bonds and that of U.S. Treasury bonds with a\u00a0similar maturity period. Venezuelan data is obtained from J.P. Morgan's\u00a0Emerging Markets Bond Index.484 The resulting premium is thus 4.6%.485\nb. Cost of Debt Financing\n463. This cost is calculated as the sum of the risk -free rate of return plus the country -risk premium, plus the industry -risk premium. The industry -risk premium is\u00a0derived from the figure calculated by Prof. Damodaran for steel works in the\u00a0U.S. in 2008, and stands at 1.5%.486 Added to the above premiums and rate, this\u00a0results in a before -tax cost of debt of 10.4% and an after-tax cost of debt of\u00a06.9% 487\nc. Capital Structure\n464. There is no information on the capital structure of Venezuelan companies with a\u00a0risk profile like Tavsa's. Faced with this situation, the Claimant's experts elect to\u00a0use the capital structure of comparable SIC 331 companies, which is the code\u00a0used in calculating the beta. The experts thus anive at a debt -to -equity ratio of\u00a023.9%.488\n465. Once the above factors are input into the formula, the resulting WACC is\u00a015.69%.489\n466. After discounting annual cash flows between May 2008 and December 2017 to\u00a0the valuation date, the experts initially anive at a value of USD 214 million;\u00a0there is then added to this value the discounted terminal value, which is USD\u00a091.9 million; the total is USD 305.9 million.490 After the capex change\u00a0introduced by the experts in their second report, that values goes down to USD\u00a0304.6 million.491 As of the valuation date, Tavsa had no outstanding financial\u00a0liabilities,492 and the experts thus made no additional calculations to assess that\n483 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 184.\n484 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 185.\n485 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 187.\n486 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 189.\n487 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 189\n488 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 190.\n489 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 191.\u00a0Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table III, p. 28.\n491 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 59.\n492 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 145.\n113\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 116 of 201\nvalue.\n467. Because Tenaris held a 70% interest in Tavsa, that percentage needs to be\u00a0applied to the total value, thus aniving at the value of its investment: USD 213.2\u00a0million.493\n1.2 MARKET MULTIPLES APPROACH\n468. This approach consists in identifying companies comparable to Tavsa and\u00a0calculating the average of the EV494/EBITDA,495 EV/Sales and EV/BVA496\u00a0multiples as of April 30, 2008.\n469. The experts used two sources for their comparable data: the list of steel tube\u00a0manufacturers compiled by Lloyd's Register Group Limited and companies\u00a0listed under SIC code 3317 (steel pipe and tubes), provided that they were\u00a0engaged in the manufacturing of seamless tubes and were publicly traded. The\u00a0sample came down to seven companies.498 Abdala/Zadicoff find no conceptual\u00a0difficulty in using companies located outside of Venezuela, as what the market\u00a0multiples approach requires is that the reference companies' economic\u00a0characteristics be reasonably similar to those of the company that is being\u00a0valued, and that they be exposed to similar risks.499\n470. The data obtained for the above parameters were as follows:500\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 59.\nEnterprise Value.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. 496 Book Value of Assets.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 65.\n498 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 193.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 109.\n500 Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table V.\n114\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 117 of 201\nMultiples as of4ri! 30. 2008\nAnhui Tianda Oil Pipe Co.\nI-bng Kong\n9.47\n1 43\n1 5A\nSanyo Special Steel Co.\nJapan\n5.84\n074\n0 4\nSC TMK-ARTROM S.A.\nRorrenia\n1408\n151\n1 04\nTubos Raunidos S.A.\nSpau\n8.14\n176\n143\nVallourec S.A.\nFrance\n6.48\n181\n1\nTonaris S.A.\nArgenhina\n10.27\n3.47\n220\nGandhi Special\ndia\n443\n1 80\n223\nMedian\n8.14x\n1.76x\nAwrage\n8.39x\n1.79x\n1.62x\n471. The above multiples are applied to Tavsa's EBITDA and sales as of December\u00a031, 2007, and its BVA as of April 30, 2008.501\nControl Premium\n472. In addition, the experts apply a conection to the above value to reflect the\u00a0control premium for the Claimant's controlling interest in Tavsa. With a 70%\u00a0stake, the Claimant had the capacity to influence the future of the company, and\u00a0that control has a price. According to the experts, it is sufficiently documented in\u00a0the literature that, when a buyer obtains a control position in a company, that\u00a0buyer pays a price above market price for that position.502\n473. In the following table, the experts have summed up the control premium figures\u00a0mentioned by the most reputed authors :503\n501 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 66.\n502 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 195.\n503 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 201.\n115\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 118 of 201\nRudonno (2009)\n15%\n- 30%\n(modarn (2005)\n15%\n20%\nHanouna, Sann and Shapiro 2001) on Damoda;an 2005)\n20%\n-\n30%\nBarclay and HoIdorne (1959,1991) on tmodairn (2005)\n10%\nNicodano and Sembenell\u00ea (2000)\n27%\nMkkolson and Ragasia (1991) on t-4otdarnas)2003)\n9.2%\nChan9 and Mayeis 1995) on Ho(dorne5s(2003)\n136%\nDyck and ZngaIas (2004)\nAr9ent,no\n27%\nBrazil\n65%\nCPoIn\n18%\nCo1omba\n27%\nMexico\n34%\n54%\n27%\n474.

Accordingly, the data derived through the multiples\u00a0approach is to be multiplied by 1.27.\u00b0\n475.

THE RESPONDENT'S VALUATION\n477. Expert Hart takes issue with the fact that the opposing party's experts\u00a0consistently chose the most optimistic possible scenario, instead of looking for a\u00a0more balanced approach that would represent the viewpoints of a hypothetical\u00a0buyer and a hypothetical seller.\n478. Hart criticizes the calculations of Abdala/Zadicoff under the two approaches: the\u00a0DCF methodology (1.) and the market multiples methodology (2.). In his second\u00a0report, the expert adds the construction of a new plant and the purchase of stock\u00a0in a different company as references to estimate Tavsa's value (3.).\n2.1 THE DCF APPROACH\n479. The expert accepts the discounted cash flows approach as a valid methodology\u00a0to assess the value of a company, but disagrees on certain assumptions used by\u00a0Abdala/Zadicoff.\n480. The first assumption he takes issue with is the valuation date; however, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal has already ruled on this issue, agreeing with the Claimant: the\u00a0valuation date is April 30, 2008.\n481. Even though in his first reports Hart framed his criticism from the perspective of\u00a0a valuation as of May 2009, he also ran an alternative calculation as of April\u00a02008, estimating the discount rate as of such date. Moreover, both at the Hearing\u00a0and in the Joint Report, he elaborated on his position regarding the value of\u00a0Tavsa as of April 2008. His main points of disagreement with Abdala/Zadicoff\u00a0are summarized next:\n506 Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table VI, p. 34\u00a0507 Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table VII, p. 34.\n508 Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table VIII, p. 35.\n509 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 68.\n117\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 120 of 201\nA. Revenue\n482. Hart rejects the assumptions underlying the revenue estimates of the opposing\u00a0experts: he is critical of the production estimates, and also disagrees on the price\u00a0estimated by Abdala/Zadicoff.\na. Production\n483. Hart is surprised that his colleagues assumed that Tavsa would produce at 90%\u00a0of its capacity in perpetuity, and that it would never run into constraints in the\u00a0availability of the supplies needed to reach such capacity level, since:\nTn 1999, the company's utilization rate was 25%,5b0 standing at 50% on average until 2007 ;51 1\nIn his opinion, blaming labor conflicts for the historical failure to reach a 90% productivity rate and expecting that such conflicts will disappear in\u00a0the future is very naive,512 because any hypothetical buyer would have\u00a0taken into consideration potential labor conflicts and their impact on\u00a0production:513 labor problems and technical and operating failures have\u00a0been a frequent occunence in the Venezuelan steel industry;514 indeed, the\u00a0contract between Tavsa and Sidor mentioned possible delays, failures and\u00a0omissions caused by strikes, lockouts and energy shortages.515\nUnder the Tavsa-Sidor contract, Sidor was required to supply up to 90,000 tons of steel per year - assuming a sales level requiring larger quantities\u00a0would be entirely unsupported.516\n484. However, expert Hart acknowledges that, in 2005, Tavsa increased its capacity\u00a0from 65,000 to 80,000 tons, but explains that it did so by increasing work shifts,\u00a0which went from 12 to 15, and adds that an increase in the number of shifts\u00a0intended to increase capacity is not a feasible solution that is sustainable in the\u00a0long term, as it causes excessive wear and tear in the company's resources517- in\u00a0fact, the effects of such wear and tear began to be felt in 2007, as Tavsa had to\u00a0invest millions of dollars in mechanical repairs.518\n510 Hart I, Figure 8.1.\u00a0511 Hart I, para. 164.\u00a0512HartII,para. 131.\n513 Hart II, para. 129.\n514 Hart I, para. 165.\n515 Hart I, para. 165.\n516 Hart I, para. 169.\nHart II, para. 129.\n518 Hart II, para. 130.\n118\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 121 of 201\n485. In the Joint Report, the expert suggests an annual production level of 50,748 tons\u00a0of tubes.519\nb. Price\n486. Expert Hart reveals irregularities in AbdalalZadicoff's calculations:\nThey apply a pricing formula that never got to be agreed upon;52\u00b0\nThen, they deviate from the formula, and use a different reference for international prices ;521\nHowever, they only use this alternative reference up to 2013, after which they raise the prices based on the inflation forecasts, but there is no reason\u00a0to keep the international pricing bubble in place.522\n487. Hart believes that Abdala/Zadicoff took advantage of the fact that the 2007 price\u00a0was part of a bubble to derive an inflated future projection. However, any\u00a0hypothetical buyer would have understood that every long-term project is subject\u00a0to ups and downs, and would have allowed for the possibility of a price\u00a0decrease;523 and, in any event, the buyer would have taken into consideration the\u00a0price's past histoiy.524\n488. In the Joint Report, Hart provides an estimation as of April 2008 using the\u00a0Canaccord Adams projections weighted at 70/30 (as negotiated between PDVSA\u00a0and Tavsa), in order to facilitate a comparison to AbdalalZadicoffs proposal.525\nB. Exnenditures\n489. The expert structures his criticism into the following major groups.\na. Costs of Goods Sold\n490. The expert criticizes the opposing experts' estimates. It is his view that the data\u00a0observation period is too short, as it covers little more than one year (January\u00a02007 - May 2008), when the acceptable choice would have been to use a period\u00a0of five years.526 He further notes that, for certain expenses, the experts decided\u00a0on shorter periods for the sole purpose of reducing costs and thus inflating the\u00a0damages amount.527 Finally, he takes issue with the opposing experts having\u00a0altogether neglected to account for certain costs, such as maintenance and repair\u00a0costs, which got to be somewhat significant in 2007.528\n519 Joint Report, para. 7.\n520 Hart I, para. 178.\n521 Hart I, para. 182.\n522 Hart I, para. 183.\n523 Hart II, para. 141.

In his second report, Hart reviewed the data for the costs incuned in the period\u00a02006 - 2008 and found a conelation between the cost of ingots (input) and the\u00a0sales price;529 and was thus able to estimate Tavsa's gross margin at 34% from\u00a02009 onwards.53\u00b0\nb. Sales, General, and Administrative Costs\n492. Tavsa also incurs fixed and semi -fixed costs associated with:531\nTechnical Assistance: Hart sees no reason to reject an extension of the technical assistance contract between Tavsa and Tamsa after the expiration\u00a0of its original duration in 2008; if such contract were not extended, then it\u00a0is possible that Tavsa would also incur costs as a result of taking over the\u00a0service itself or finding another third -party provider.532\nSales Expenses: these include social fund provisions, invoicing tax and transportation costs, but should not include extraordinary expenses, as\u00a0these are already reflected in the direct production costs. Transportation\u00a0costs are also included; however, the expert is unable to verify the figures\u00a0used by Abdala/Zadicoff, as they have not proven that these are the rates\u00a0actually paid for transportation.533 In his second report, Hart estimates that,\u00a0on average, social fund provisions and commissions between 2006 and\u00a02008 stood at 5.37% and 2%, respectively.534\nAdministrative Expenses: Abdala/Zadicoff took the 2007 costs and projected them, increasing them by the Venezuelan CPI; however, the\u00a0expert fails to understand why they did not engage in a more exhaustive\u00a0analysis, covering a longer period of time, and why they have not justified\u00a0that these expenses are tied to the CPI.535 In his second report, Hart\u00a0estimates the average for these expenses between 2006 and 2008 at USD\u00a01.3 million.536\nC. Capex\n493. It is Hart's view that Abdala/Zadicoff's assumptions are not realistic: it is not\u00a0possible for a plant producing at maximum capacity not to need additional\u00a0investments537 beyond the depreciation of its fixed assets;538 in addition, it is a\u00a0fact that an industrial plant's maintenance costs will tend to grow (not decrease)\u00a0over time.539\n529 Hart II, para. 166.\n530 Hart II, para. 168.\n531 Hart I, para. 193.\n532 Hart I, para. 194.\nHart I, para. 195.\nHart II, paras. 171, 172.\nHart I, para. 196.\n536 Hart II, para. 174.\nHart I, para. 202.\n538 Hart I, para. 201.\nHart I, para. 202.\n120\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 123 of 201\n494. The expert believes that, given the USD 7 million in extraordinary repair\u00a0costs,54\u00b0 a hypothetical buyer would have increased investments to the amount\u00a0necessary to maintain the desired production level (which, according to\u00a0Abdala/Zadicoff, is 80,000 tons per year541), with no need to resort to additional\u00a0extraordinary repairs.542 Hart has estimated investments based on the average for\u00a02006 - 2008, increased by the inflation rate up to 2013.\nd. Changes in Working Capital\n495. The expert does not seem to find the data estimated by Abdala/Zadicoff reliable,\u00a0as they set operating cash as 10 days of revenue. Considering the time required\u00a0to convert inputs into cash and the credit problems in 2008, Hart argues that the\u00a0opposing experts' suggestion is aggressive.544\n496. Hart also points out that 10 days of revenue in 2007 would equal almost USD 4\u00a0million. Since Tavsa had almost USD 15 million as operating cash, this would\u00a0mean it would have USD 14 million in excess cash. The expert is not sure how\u00a0to reconcile this assumption with the fact that, in 2008, Tavsa owed Sidor close\u00a0to USD 9 million.545\n497. In his second report, Hart estimates the average working capital in 2006 - 2008\u00a0at 34%, and finds this figure to be a reasonable estimate up to 20 13.546\nC. Discount Rate\n498.

The expert slightly disagrees on some of Abdala/Zadicoff's assumptions, such as\u00a0the capital structure, but agrees to perform his alternative WACC calculation in\u00a0line with the opposing experts' proposal; in other cases, he categorically\u00a0disagrees and chooses new assumptions and new calculations. Only the latter\u00a0cases will be summarized in this section:\na. Risk -Free Rate\n500. Abdala/Zadicoff choose to equate the risk -free rate to the yield of 10 -year U.S.\u00a0Treasury bonds (not 30 -year bonds), as 10 -year bonds are more liquid and less\u00a0sensitive to inflation changes, a view that is supported by other authors.\u00a0However, Hart claims to have checked the sources cited by the opposing experts\u00a0and found that, in a more recent edition of such sources, they change their view\u00a0and go for bonds with a longer maturity period. 548\n501. In any event, Hart shows his preference for 20 -year bonds, which, he claims, are\u00a0the bonds which are commonly used in valuation exercises and are the ones used\u00a0by Morningstar to determine the long-term risk -free rate549 which, thus\u00a0calculated, as of April 30, 2008, was 45%550\nb. Equity Risk Premium\n502. The opposing parties have calculated the geometric average of historical data,\u00a0based on the opinion of two well -respected authors. Hart contends that the newer\u00a0editions of those authors' works show that they have preferred arithmetic\u00a0averages.551 Using the arithmetic average, the equity risk premium goes up to\u00a06.2%.552\nc. Beta\n503. AbdalalZadicoff apply Bloomberg's \"reversion -to -one\" adjustment to the beta. Hart,\u00a0however, disagrees. The expert explains that this adjustment is recommended only\u00a0when it can be reasonably accepted that, in the long term, the company's products\u00a0and clients will diversify and, therefore, the company's risk will tend to converge\u00a0with the market risk. However, for Tavsa, this is not a reasonable assumption, as\u00a0there is no indication that its products will change, or its client mix expand: rather, it\n548 Hart I, para. 247.\nHart I, para. 248.\nHart I, para. 249.\n551 Hart I, paras. 251, 252, 253.\n552 Hart I, para. 255.\n122\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 125 of 201\nseems everything will remain as is.553\n504. The above does not mean that Hart is not advocating for an adjustment to the\u00a0beta coefficient; he prefers the adjustment performed by Morningstar for SIC\u00a0331 companies in March 2008, under the hypothesis that, in the long run, a\u00a0company's beta will move towards the beta of the peer group:555\nLeveraged beta\n2.25\nAdjusted leverage beta\n2.17\nU.S. debt/equity\n0.239\nU.S. tax rate\n40%\nUnleveraged beta\n1.9\nOptimal debt/equity structure\n23.9%\nVenezuelan tax rate\n34%\nBeta\n2.2\nd. Country Risk Premium\n505. In the Joint Report, expert Hart mentions that 4.6%, which is the premium over\u00a0the \"pure discount bond,\" does not necessarily reflect the full country risk. The\u00a0expert would be willing to accept any value between the premium over the pure\u00a0discount bond up to 14.75%, which is the country risk premium used in the\u00a0Tidewater award.556\ne. Size Premium\n506. Expert Hart finds it necessary to perform a size adjustment, as the comparable\u00a0companies used to estimate the beta were larger than Tavsa;557 specifically, they\u00a0were mid -cap companies, where Tavsa is viewed as \"micro-cap.\"558 The\u00a0difference between the mid -cap size premium and the micro -cap size premium is\nHart I, para. 257.\nM Hart I, para. 259.\nHart I, para. 258. 556 Joint Report, para. 22.\nHart I, para. 261.\n558 Hart I, para. 264.\nHart I, para. 264.\n123\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 126 of 201\n507. With the above conections applied to the discounted cash flows model, the\u00a0resulting value for Tenaris' stake in Tavsa as of April 30, 2008 is USD 36.9\u00a0million, which is the result of adding to the USD 44.8 million cash flows a\u00a0terminal value of almost USD 8 million, and applying the 70% factor. 560\n2.2 MARKET MULTIPLES\n508. The expert also provided his opinion on the subsidiary method to assess Tavsa's\u00a0value, which he calls the \"guideline public company analysis.\"561\n509. Abdala/Zadicoff selected seven comparable companies, but Hart does not\u00a0believe that all seven are comparable, as they include Vallourec S.A. - a\u00a0company with worldwide operations and sales 6,000 times higher than Tavsa's,\u00a0which disqualifies it as a comparable.562\n510. In addition, the opposing experts did not use homogenous data. For some\u00a0companies, they used the twelve months up to March 31, 2008; for others, they\u00a0used the data on their yearly statements as of December 31, 2007. To assess the\u00a0debt level, they used data as of June 30, 2008.563\n511. The next step, as per this method, should have been a normalization of the\u00a0financial statements of both the comparable companies and the target company.\u00a0However, Hart contends that the opposing experts did not perform such\u00a0normalization, which is completely inappropriate, as a hypothetical buyer would\u00a0not have just assessed a single year of sales, let alone 2007, which had very high\u00a0sales.564\n512. Regarding the four ratios selected by the opposing experts, Hart made the following\u00a0observations :565\n- The use of the EV/sales ratio is not recommended, except for companies with little to no history and without the capacity to generate positive cash\u00a0flows;\n- The EV/BVA ratio is usually measured using the firm's book value, not the book value of the assets.\n513. Lastly, the expert disagrees on the 27% control premium. First, Hart argues that,\u00a0for an adequately -managed company, there should not be a difference in the\u00a0value of majority interests vis-\u00e0-vis minority interests.566 Second, the expert\u00a0asserts that a generic control premium should not be used; instead, the premium\u00a0should be quantified based on facts and circumstances specific to the company\u00a0that is being valued, its industry, its country and the global economy;567\n560 Joint Report, Tavsa 2008 Spreadsheet, selecting all values as suggested by Credibility, applying the Tidewater country\u00a0risk premium; application of the rate in the Tidewater award would push the value down to USD 29.5 million.\n561 Hart I, para. 208\n562 Hart I, para. 211.\n563 Hart I, para. 212.\nHart I, para. 213.\n565 Hart I, para. 214.\n566 Hart I, para. 240.\n567 Hart I, para. 242.\n124\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 127 of 201\nhowever, in this case the opposing experts simply took the control premium mentioned in a study based on four acquisitions in unspecified sectors in\u00a0Venezuela.568\n2.3 OTHER VALUE INDICATORS\n514. Hart refers to the new plant built by Tenaris in Mexico and the purchase of a\u00a0majority stake in a plant in Indonesia. He claims both transactions show that\u00a0Hart's proposed value of USD 43.3 million is in line with reality.569\nNew Plant in Mexico\n515. In September 2008, Tenaris announced the construction of a seamless tube plant\u00a0in Mexico, with a capacity of 450,000 tons per year (Tavsa has 14% of that\u00a0capacity) at a cost of USD 850 million.570 Applying these figures to Tavsa, 70%\u00a0of its value, built anew, would be USD 85.9 million. However, it would still be\u00a0necessary to apply a correction factor to reflect Tavsa's current status, which can\u00a0be between 25% and 50%, and, therefore, its value would be USD 43 to 64.5\u00a0million.571\nTransaction in Indonesia\n516. In February 2009, Tenaris acquired a 77.45% shareholding in a seamless tube\u00a0manufacturer in Indonesia. The company's annual capacity is 12,000 tons, and\u00a0the price paid for it was USD 93.6 million. Extrapolating these figures to Tavsa,\u00a0the 70% interest would be worth USD 35.5 million.572\n517. Lastly, Hart brings up the following point: Tamsa paid USD 11.7 million for a\u00a070% interest in Tavsa in 1999, and spent USD 41.9 million in capital\u00a0expenditures and maintenance. Moreover, it received USD 32 million from the\u00a0technical assistance contract and commissions.573 In other words, were the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal to award compensation in a sum around the ones suggested by\u00a0the Claimants, the Claimants would be earning a return of 400% to 500% on\u00a0their investment.574\n568 Hart I, para. 241.\n569 Hart II, para. 197.\u00a0\u00b0 Hart II, para. 195.\u00a0' Hart II, para. 195.\n572 Hart II, para. 196.

Even though both experts agree that Tavsa's value is to be calculated through a\u00a0DCF methodology (1.), the Arbitral Tribunal will also rule on other proposed\u00a0approaches, for comparison purposes (2.).\n3.1 DCF\n519. As regards the compensation due for Tavsa's expropriation, the experts are in\u00a0agreement that the best way to calculate such compensation is through the\u00a0discounted cash flows method.\n520. It was made clear at the Hearing that the points of disagreement between the\u00a0experts as regards the value assessment were really four575 - even though all four\u00a0are major points: tube production (A.), tube price (B.), certain costs (C.) and\u00a0WACC (D.).\n521. At the end of the Hearing, the Arbitral Tribunal asked both Parties' experts to\u00a0engage in the following joint exercise, to the extent possible:576 they were to\u00a0prepare a spreadsheet where the Arbitral Tribunal would be able to choose, from\u00a0drop -down options, between the two opposite positions for each conflicting\u00a0assumption (or even choose a third option) and where, as per the options selected\u00a0by the Tribunal, Tavsa's value would be automatically recalculated.577 The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal also invited the experts to summarize the reasons for their\u00a0disagreement in a brief report. The experts complied with the request through the\u00a0so-called Joint Report.578\n522. Next, the Arbitral Tribunal will rule on each of the four points of disagreement.\nA. Tube Production\n523. The goal here is to determine, from the perspective of a hypothetical buyer in\u00a0April 2008, the estimated quantity of tubes Tavsa could produce in the future,\u00a0from the two options proposed by the experts (a.). And, should the Tribunal\u00a0choose the lower quantity, whether labor costs need to be adjusted (b.).\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is aware that there are more points of disagreement between the experts; however, the ones that account for virtually the entire difference in value are four, and these are the only ones which, for efficiency concerns, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal will address next.\n576T., pp.1228:13-1229:13.\nThe exercise was two -fold: for a valuation date as of April 2008, and also as of May 2009. Because the Arbitral Tribunal has already decided that the valuation date will be April 2008, in this section of the Award it will only refer to\u00a0those calculations which are relevant to said valuation date.\n578 Joint Report.\n126\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 129 of 201\na. \u00a0\u00a0Annual Production\n524. The two options proposed by the experts are 72,000 or 50,748 tons of tubes per\nyear:\nThe 72,000 figure the Claimant advocates for is based on the assumption that, in the future, Tavsa would operate at its maximum production\u00a0capacity (80,000 tons of tubes per year), at a utilization rate of 90%, which\u00a0results in 72,000 tons per year. These had been the production estimates\u00a0used by Tavsa's management for 2008/2009.\nThe 50,748 figure estimated by the Respondent is the result of averaging production in the last three years.58\u00b0\n525. It is the Arbitral Tribunal's view that it is more likely that a hypothetical buyer\u00a0would have rejected the Claimant's estimate and chosen the Respondent's\u00a0estimate instead:\n526. The projected 72,000 tons per year find support only in Tavsa's management's\u00a0budget for 2008/2009. The Arbitral Tribunal does not think a hypothetical buyer\u00a0would have recognized that much creditability to this estimate, since:\nTavsa's management's estimates were not usually too on point; for instance, in their 2007/2008 budget, they made provision for 80,860 tons\u00a0per year, of which only one half were actually produced (43,250 tons).581\nEven though the company's production level had been on the rise since 2002, historical production peaked in 2007, at 55,189 tons582 - thus, far\u00a0from the 72,000 tons that are now being projected; Abdala/Zadicoff have\u00a0stated that, at the time of expropriation, Tavsa produced 80,000 tons of\u00a0pipes per year,583 while expert Hart has claimed that that level was never\u00a0actually reached.584 Abdala/Zadicoff have refened to the 2007 financial\u00a0statements as evidence; the Tribunal has reviewed those statements and\u00a0found that 2007 production was 55,189 tons,585 a figure that, far from\u00a0proving the reliability of the estimated 72,000 tons, refutes it.\nTavsa never managed to reach a utilization rate of 90% either; in fact, its historical utilization peaked at 75% in 2005.586\n57\n580\n581\n582\n583\n584\n585\n586\n  \n9cLEx-36.\nJoint Report.

In contrast, the proposed 50,748 annual tons have a very solid basis: it is the\u00a0average real production over the last three years. A hypothetical buyer would\u00a0have chosen to project a production level in line with historical production, and\u00a0would have dismissed the Claimant's estimates as pure speculation.\nThe Claimant's Counter -Arguments\n528. (i) The Claimant has pointed to labor conflicts in the past as the cause of the\u00a0company's low production level; these conflicts went away in 2008, when Tavsa\u00a0came to an agreement with the unions.587\n529. The argument is not convincing, because the problems with the workers marked\u00a02006 and they might have been the reason why production was limited to 56,700\u00a0tons that year;588 this does not, however, explain the fall in production in all\u00a0other years, with production far from the yearly 72,000 tons projected by\u00a0Tavsa's management for the future. And the experts have not identified any\u00a0production improvement introduced in 2008 that could justify the sudden\u00a0increase in production.\n530. (ii) The Claimant's experts have also mentioned that PDVSA had publicly\u00a0announced its intention to substitute tube imports with domestically -manufactured tubes.589 Indeed, in a presentation dated October 2007,590 PDVSA\u00a0had stated its intention to double the consumption of supplies in the oil sector\u00a0and cut down imports to favor local supplies, which would increase up to 70%\u00a0(as compared to the 41% existing at the time).591\n531. PDVSA's statement is recorded in a slide presentation, where the increase in\u00a0domestic procurement from 41% to 70% is described as a \"challenge\" and a\u00a0\"goal to be reached through adequate public policies.\" The presentation does not\u00a0define what these policies will be and does not constitute a firm supply\u00a0commitment. PDVSA's presentation is too generic to convince a hypothetical\u00a0buyer that the production increase projected by the Claimant was feasible and\u00a0that any increased production would have PDVSA as a buyer.\nb. Labor Cost Adjustment\n532. Lastly, the Claimant argues that, if a yearly production level below 72.000 tons\u00a0was used as an assumption, this would call for a reduction in labor costs,\u00a0readjusting labor to the new estimated production level.592 Specifically, were\u00a0production set at 50,748 tons, as suggested by the Respondent, labor costs\u00a0should go down, proportionately, by\n587 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 26.\n588 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 26.\n589 H 3, slide 7.\n590cLEx-84.\n591 CLEX-84, p. 26.

The Arbitral Tribunal has verified that the proposed adjustment is conect,594 that\u00a0the adjustment to the cash flows model should only apply to the variable portion\u00a0of labor costs (a function of production), and that the Claimant has considered\u00a0that 50% of labor costs are variable; all hypotheses seem reasonable.\n534. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided to apply the 30% adjustment to\u00a0variable labor costs.\n535. To conclude, the Arbitral Tribunal has agreed that the reasonable estimate of\u00a0future annual production be set at 50,748 tons, as suggested by the Respondent;\u00a0it has also agreed, however, that variable labor costs should be proportionately\u00a0reduced, as requested by the Claimant.\nB. The Price of Tubes\n536. The next aspect to be determined is how to estimate the price of the tubes (a.)\u00a0and, once a calculation formula has been decided on, what a specific parameter\u00a0should be within that formula (b.).\na. Pricing Formula\n537. The Parties' experts disagree as to the manner in which the future price is to be\u00a0estimated:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the Claimant's view that the formula Tavsa was in the course of\nnegotiating with PDVSA when the expropriation took place should apply;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, the Respondent believes that, because no agreement had\nyet been reached regarding that formula, it should be disregarded, and suggests using the historical price average, increased by the CPI, instead.\n538. It is the Tribunal's opinion that the issue is not so much whether the formula that\u00a0was being negotiated with PDVSA had or had not been actually agreed upon as\u00a0what the best indication of the future price of the tubes would be, in the eyes of a\u00a0hypothetical buyer. Because PDVSA was Tavsa's only customer at the time of\u00a0the expropriation and none of the experts has identified any reasons to believe\u00a0this was bound to change, the reasonable solution would be to assume that the\u00a0future price would be the one agreed upon with PDVSA.\n539. Again, the most sensible solution is to assume that, in the future, PDVSA and\u00a0Tavsa would apply the pricing formula they were then negotiating, because, as\u00a0the sole customer, PDVSA had significant bargaining power, and the negotiated\u00a0formula was beneficial to it as it mitigated its concern that the price would be\u00a0driven up by the upward trend observed in international markets (in fact, a few\u00a0months after the expropriation, Tavsa and PDVSA agreed on the new formula).\n(72,000 - 50,748)172,000.\n129\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 132 of 201\n540. In contrast, there is no basis at all to assume that, in the future, Tavsa and\u00a0PDVSA would be completely altering the price calculation formula and agreeing\u00a0on a formula based on the average price paid between 2006 and 2008, increased\u00a0by inflation, as suggested by the Respondent.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0The International Price Reference\n541. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided that the formula to set the future\u00a0price will be the one Tavsa was negotiating with PDVSA at the time of its\u00a0expropriation. Pro memoria, the formula is as follows:\nPt is the price in month t\nPt-i is the price in month t-1\nPPLi is the reference price published by Pipe Logix for month t-1\nPPL2 is the reference price published by Pipe Logix for month t-2\n542. As per the formula, the international reference price (weighted at 70%) is the\u00a0price published by Pipe Logix; however, Pipe Logix is an index that tracks\u00a0global sales of seamless tubes,596 and only projects prices one year ahead, which\u00a0is why it is not valid for longer -term projections.\n543. It is then necessary to substitute the international reference to Pipe Logix with a\u00a0different index. Here, the experts engage in debate as to the best substitute:\nThe Claimant suggest projecting the prices of HRC (the main component of seamless tubes) published by Metal Bulletin Research; whereas\nThe Respondent597 finds it better to use the HRC prices published by Canaccord.\n544. To choose between these two price forecasts, the Respondent's expert has relied\u00a0on the recommendations issued by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and\u00a0Exploration, contained in a letter addressed to the United States Securities and\u00a0Exchange Commission.598 In that letter, the Society recommends that the prices\u00a0of raw materials be estimated based on the short- and long-term projections\u00a0issued by the company's management (i.), and requires that a \"competent\u00a0person\" verify that such projections are in line with historical prices or\u00a0commercial contracts (u.).599\nHart II, para. 158.\n596T p. 834.\nIn its subsidiary claim, as its primary position is that the price is to be determined as the historical average, increased by the CPI.\n598 CRED-44.\nHart I, para. 125: \"Commodity prices used for the determination of Mineral Reserves should be based on forward -looking estimates reflecting management's reasonable short- and long-term expectations as supported by available evidence. The basis for the selected prices must be justified and supported by appropriate documentation. The Competent\u00a0Person must ascertain that these prices are consistent with historical prices or with sales agreements and marketing\u00a0determinations.\"\n130\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 133 of 201\n(i) Management Forecasts\n545. In this case, both Parties agree that Tavsa used the Metal Bulletin Research price\u00a0forecasts as basis for its own future price estimations.60\u00b0\n546. There is no evidence that Tavsa's management ever used the prices published by\u00a0Canaccord to derive their future price estimates.601\n(ii) Commercial Contracts\n547. The Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration's assessment guideline also\u00a0points to the prices provided for in commercial agreements, as indicative of the\u00a0adequacy of the future estimates.\n548. The Claimant has produced a historical contract (from 1997) between Sidor and\u00a0CVG Tubos (Tavsa's predecessor)602 where Metal Bulletin is defined as follows:\n\"A prestigious U.S. weekly publication specializing in the behavior of the global market for iron and steel products. Metal Bulletin is widely used as a\u00a0valid reference to determine and project the prices of iron and steel\u00a0products.\"\n549. And in the long-term HBI supply contract between Comsigua and Tamsa,603 the\u00a0price reference is the change in the prices of three raw materials, as per Metal\u00a0Bulletin.604\n550. The Respondent, however, has not produced any commercial contract mentioning Canaccord Adams.605\n600 T., p. 1171.\n601 T., pp. 1176, 1177.\n602cLEx12\n603cLEx16\n604 Article 3.1 on the fixed per -ton price.\n605 T., pp. 1176, 1177.\n131\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 134 of 201\n551. Basically, both the forecasts of Tavsa's management and the historical\u00a0commercial agreements support the reliability of the Metal Bulletin Research\u00a0price estimates.\nThe Respondent's Counter -Argument\n552. Expert Hart has argued that Canaccord Adams's forecasts are more consistent with\u00a0historical prices and, therefore, should be prefened.\n553. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.\n554. The premise to be validated is to be framed as follows: would a hypothetical\u00a0buyer deciding to project future prices based on historical prices consider the\u00a0Canaccord Adams forecasts or the Metal Bulletin Research ones to be more\u00a0reliable?\n555. In the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, the answer favors Metal Bulletin Research, as\u00a0it has already been established in the above paragraphs that this is a reference\u00a0publication in the industry, whereas Canaccord Adams is an investment bank\u00a0that publishes prices for the iron and steel industry, as well as for other\u00a0sectors,606 and was chosen by expert Hart because he had knowledge of past\u00a0reports and considered them to be \"good and informative.\"607 Expert Hart has\u00a0not persuaded the Arbitral Tribunal that, inespective of its predictive reliability,\u00a0Canaccord Adams would be a price reference publication for a hypothetical\u00a0buyer.\nC. Exnenditures\n556. Under this heading, the Tribunal must determine which one is the more reliable\u00a0projection of opex (a.), capex and depreciation (b.), working capital (c.) and the\u00a0existence or inexistence of a technical assistance contract (d.).\na. 0pex608\n557. The Claimant's experts estimate the opex based on the 2007 costs,609 adjusted as\u00a0per the expected inflation.\n558. Expert Hart disagrees because, as compared to the historical average, the costs\u00a0projected by Abdala/Zadicoff are significantly lower. At the Hearing, Hart\u00a0argued that Tavsa's gross margin between 2002 and 2008 stood at around 20%\u00a0in 2002, grew year after year and peaked at 45% in 2006, thereafter declining to\u00a020% in 2008; the average would be 35%, while the margin anived at based on\u00a0AbdalalZadicoffs cost projections exceeds 45% 610 Hart suggests using the opex\npp. 1175, 1176.\n607 T., p. 1176.\n608 The cost of steel is not included.\n609 Tavsa 2008, Joint Model, Compass Lexicon.\n610 H 4, slide 18. Figures are estimates.\n132\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 135 of 201\naverage between 2005 and 2007,611 increasing it every year based on the expected U.S. PPI.612\n559. The methodology used by the experts is similar, as they both increase the\u00a0previous year's costs by inflation. The difference lies in the starting point - the\u00a02008 costs:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant derives such costs by increasing the previous year's costs by\ninflation, while\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent calculates the average for the last three years.\n560. If the projection consists in increasing the previous year's costs, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this (since Tavsa's costs are stable over\u00a0time)613 for 2008: that year's costs are also to be calculated by increasing the\u00a02007 costs to account for inflation.\n561. The Arbitral Tribunal thus accepts the opex calculation as proposed by the\u00a0Claimant.\nb. Capex\n562. The experts' positions are as follows:\nAbdala/Zadicoff calculate 2008 depreciation based on the 2007 depreciable assets614 and the following year's depreciation based on the preceding\u00a0year's; lastly, they equate capex to each year's depreciation,615 consistently\u00a0with the assumption that Tavsa will not be making additional investments.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hart, however, calculates the historical average for 2006 and 2007 capex,\napplies the PPI and thus anives at the capex for 2008, based on which he calculates depreciation.616\n563. The Arbitral Tribunal considers both hypotheses to be plausible, and neither one\u00a0inconect. However, the Arbitral Tribunal must choose one (it will, however,\u00a0note at this point that its decision will not have a significant impact on Tavsa's\u00a0value).\n564. The Tribunal will use the approach used by the Claimant, which finds support in\u00a0the opinion of Prof. Damodaran - who is a highly -respected asset valuation\u00a0expert and whose opinion is constantly refened to by both Parties' experts. Prof.\u00a0Damodaran states that, for projects of indefinite duration (as is the case here),\u00a0capex should approach depreciation.617 The Claimant's proposal perfectly fits\n611 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Credibility Opex.\n612 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Production and Commercial Costs, Credibility.\n613 T, p. 1008 (in reference to stable margins).\n614 Even though 2007 was a year with extraordinary results, this does not have an impact on depreciation.\n615 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Capex & Depreciations, FCF.\n616 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Capex & Depreciations, FCF.\n617 \"As a simple rule of thumb, when projects have infmite life, the capital maintenance expenditures should approach\u00a0depreciation.\" Cf Damodaran, Aswath: Supporting Material to \"Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice,\" Wiley, 2nd\u00a0ed., 2001, available at http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/ -adamodarlNew\\_Home\\_Page/CF2E.htm (Cf section \"3.\n133\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 136 of 201\nthis rule; the Respondent's however, does not: from 2008 to 2010, depreciation exceeds capex, even though the two progressively approach and the opposite is\u00a0true from 2011 onwards: capex are increasingly higher than depreciation.618\n565. To sum up, the Arbitral Tribunal has opted for the Claimant's suggestion.\nc. Working Capital\n566. Both Parties' experts have adopted very different approaches to calculate\u00a0working capital:\nAbdala/Zadicoff determined what the reasonable ratios (measured in days) should be for the variables making up the working capital; then, they\u00a0applied such ratios to the estimated revenue and cost figures, thus aniving\u00a0at the final working capital figures;619\nHart has not used the reasonable ratio in his valuation exercise; instead, he calculated the average ratio of working capital to revenue for 2005 to 2007,\u00a0which is 31%, and applied this 31% to the revenue estimated for each year,\u00a0thus aniving at the working capital.62\u00b0\n567. The Arbitral Tribunal believes AbdalalZadicoff's hypotheses are risky and\u00a0historical data show that Tavsa's working capital was more conservative. Next is\u00a0a comparison of the Claimant's proposal to historical data for the basic\u00a0variables621 in the working capital determination:622\nCash and equivalents: the average ratio of cash and cash equivalents to revenue (measured in days), based on all historical data, is 35 days;623\u00a0however, the Claimant used 10 days as reference for its working capital\u00a0calculation;624\nDerivations and Discussion\" of \"Chapter 9: Estimating Earnings and Cashflows on Projects\").\n618 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Capex & Depreciations, FCF.\n619 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Working Capital, Compass Lexecon.\n620 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Working Capital, Credibility.\n621 As per the traditional accounting denomination.\n622 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Working Capital.\n623 = 64.6 (1999) + 14.4 (2000) + 20.3 (2001) + 34.9 (2002) + 83.1 (2003) + 9.7 (2004) + 5.5 (2005) + 44.5 (2006) +\u00a039.6 (2007)19 yearsl.\n624 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model.

The Arbitral Tribunal believes a hypothetical buyer would have analyzed\u00a0Tavsa's historical behavior and ruled out the Claimant's hypotheses in\u00a0calculating the working capital on account of these being overly risky.\n569. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal will choose the option proposed by expert Hart\u00a0in the working capital calculation, which is consistent with historical data.\nd. Technical Assistance Contract\n570. The Claimant suggests that, at the end of the technical assistance contract\u00a0between Tavsa and Tamsa, the parties would not have renewed said contract\u00a0because, after a period of 10 years, Tavsa would be in a position to be able to\u00a0handle its own technical management. 630\n571. On the contrary, Hart believes this cost would continue to apply always, as\u00a0someone would have to take over technical assistance and be paid for it. 631\n572. The Respondent's position seems to be more convincing and consistent with\u00a0other assumptions in the model, such as the indefinite duration for Tavsa: in\u00a0order to validate the assumption that Tavsa is a company of indefinite duration,\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal needs to be convinced that it will not become technically\u00a0obsolete. Up to 2008, technical innovation was provided by Tamsa and, from that\u00a0date onwards, either Tavsa would have to outsource it from a different company or\u00a0it would have to devote its own resources to R+D work.\n625 = 213 (1999) + 69.4 (2000) + 63.8 (2001) + 65.9 (2002) + 131.2 (2003) + 105.8 (2004) + 80.1 (2005) + 60.7 (2006) +\u00a064.1 (2007)/9 yearsl.\n626 = 223.2 (1999) + 124.9 (2000) + 155.5 (2001) + 216.2 (2002) + 136.2 (2003) + 100.7 (2004) + 90.5 (2005) + 104.9\u00a0(2006) + 112.1(2007) /9 yearsl.\n627 = 0.8 (1999) + 25.9 (2000) + 1.7 (2001) + 3.7 (2002) + 0.2 (2003) + 0.8 (2004) + 0.8 (2005) + 0.1 (2006) + 0.8 (2007)\u00a0/9yearsl.\n628 = 193.4 (1999) + 175.7 (2000) + 76.6 (2001) + 117.3 (2002) + 174.5 (2003) + 56.6 (2004) + 35.7 (2005) + 75 (2006)\u00a0+ 77 (2007) / 9 yearsl.\n629 = 6.2 (1999) + 8.4 (2000) + 6 (2001) + 9.4 (2002) + 8.1 (2003) + 5.4 (2004) + 4.8 (2005) + 3.3 (2006) + 3.3 (2007)/9\u00a0yearsl.\n\u00b0 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 50.\n631 Hart I, para. 194.\n135\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 138 of 201\n573. What the Claimant suggests, however, is that Tavsa would be technically\u00a0competitive without assuming any cost on account of technological innovation,\u00a0which is an assumption the Arbitral Tribunal cannot validate.\n574. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the Respondent's assumption that, from\u00a02009 onwards, Tavsa would devote to technical assistance a sum equivalent to\u00a0the one it used to pay Tamsa under the contract: 3% of revenue.\nSubsidiary Claim\n575. As a subsidiary position for the event the Arbitral Tribunal should include a\u00a0technical assistance expense, experts Abdala/Zadicoff have raised a separate\u00a0claim in Tamsa's name.\n576. The experts' argument seems to be as follows: if the assumption that Tavsa\u00a0continued to pay for technical assistance is accepted, then its cash flows would\u00a0be reduced; on the other hand, Tamsa would cease to receive income from the\u00a0technical assistance contract. The conclusion would then be that Tamsa must be\u00a0entitled to be paid compensation for such lost income.\n577. The argument is a non sequitur: the exercise here consists in assessing Tavsa's\u00a0value and, in the course of that exercise, the Arbitral Tribunal will validate\u00a0realistic hypotheses - the fate of other companies, such as Tamsa, has no bearing\u00a0on this exercise. Moreover, the Arbitral Tribunal is bound to rule based on the\u00a0parties' cases and claims only, and in this case the Claimants' petitum refers to\u00a0compensation for their investments in Tavsa and Comsigua,632 but no mention is\u00a0made at all to an investment in or of Tamsa.\nD. WACC\n578. There are three WACC parameters the Arbitral Tribunal must rule on:\na. Risk -Free Rate\n579. The proposed alternatives are: 4.29%, in the opinion of the Claimant' experts,\u00a0and 4.5%, in the opinion of the Respondent's expert. The difference is due\u00a0mostly to the bonds' maturity period: 10 -year bonds, as proposed by the\u00a0Claimant, or 20 -year bonds, as proposed by the Respondent.\n580. The Arbitral Tribunal will use a 10 -year maturity period, as this is the period that\u00a0is closer to the valuation horizon, i.e. nine years (2008 - 2017) and, therefore,\u00a0the one that is more representative.\n632\n  \nCI, para. 235 (c); CIV, para. 321(c); CV, para. 319 (c).\n136\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 139 of 201\nb. Market Premium\n581. The choice here is between 4.79%, as per the Claimant's experts, and 6.2%, as\u00a0per the Respondent's expert, depending on whether a geometric average or an\u00a0arithmetic average is used, respectively.\n582. The use of a geometric or an arithmetic average is still the subject of open debate\u00a0in the valuation literature, as acknowledged by the experts, with pros and cons\u00a0for one or the other average.\n583. The Arbitral Tribunal is unable to solve this issue and rule on a prefened choice\u00a0on absolute terms. However, in this case, it has to choose one of the two\u00a0averages, and must then go for the arithmetic average, due to reasons of simple\u00a0internal consistency: because the market premium is the difference between the\u00a0market return and the risk -free rate, then consistency requires that the calculation\u00a0method be in line with the calculation of the risk -free rate.\n584. The Arbitral Tribunal has already decided that the appropriate risk -free rate is\u00a0the one calculated by the Claimant and, in accordance with exhibit CLEX 69,\u00a0produced by experts Abdala/Zadicoff, they have used a simple arithmetic\u00a0average both to derive the monthly average risk free rate and to derive the annual\u00a0average.\n585. However, the same experts suggest applying a geometric average to determine\u00a0the market premium, and this course of action is inconsistent and should be ruled\u00a0out.\n586. The market premium will then be calculated as an arithmetic average, as\u00a0suggested by expert Hart.\nc. Beta\n587. The difference is between the 1.86 proposed by Abdala/Zadicoff and the 2.2\u00a0suggested by Hart, and is the result of the different adjustments applied to the\u00a0beta coefficient by each expert:\nAbdala/Zadicoff apply the reversion -to -one adjustment, which is based on the empirical verification that every company's beta moves towards the\u00a0average beta, which is one, over time; the experts rely on the opinion of\u00a0Prof. Damodaran.633\nHart, for his part, finds that the premises to apply the reversion -to -one are not satisfied, and advocates for applying the Morningstar adjustment,\u00a0which suggests that a company's beta will approach the average beta of its\u00a0peer group.634\n633cLEx62\n634 CRED-6, p. 15.\n137\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 140 of 201\n588. The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that the reversion -to -one adjustment is\u00a0applicable here. According to Prof. Damodaran's opinion, relied upon by the\u00a0Claimant, the premise for this adjustment is that the company's product mix and\u00a0its client base usually diversify as the company grows.635 However, as regards\u00a0Tavsa, it is a manufacturer of seamless tubes, with a single client in the local\u00a0market and with no growth forecasts. The premise to apply the adjustment does\u00a0not seem to be satisfied.\n589. As to the adjustment proposed by the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal takes\u00a0note that it has not been the subject of criticism and, therefore, between the two\u00a0proposed options, the Arbitral Tribunal will choose the adjustment suggested by\u00a0the Respondent.\nd. Country Risk Premium\n590. AbdalalZadicoff suggest a premium of 4.6%. The Respondent's expert has\u00a0changed his position as to the country risk premium:\n591. (i) In his first report, Hart accepted the country risk premium suggested by the\u00a0Claimant: 4.6%.636\n592. (ii) In his second report, the expert first brought up the Tidewater award. Hart\u00a0explained that the risk premium could also reflect other risks in addition to those\u00a0which have traditionally been included. He noted that the 4.6% rate only reflects\u00a0the risk of the Venezuelan Government's default on its USD-denominated bonds,\u00a0but not the additional risk of doing business in Venezuela as opposed to the U.S.,\u00a0which would be a much higher rate.637 In support of this position, he relied on\u00a0the Tidewater award as an example of an arbitral tribunal that had elected to\u00a0include other additional risks.638 But in his second report, Hart continued to\u00a0advocate for a 4.6% premium.639 Consequently, it looks like both Parties' experts\u00a0were in agreement on this figure.\n593. (iii) Everything changed at the Evidentiary Hearing. There, Hart's position takes\u00a0a radical turn for the first time, and he openly suggests that the country risk\u00a0premium be set at 14.75%,640 which is the rate accepted as country risk by the\u00a0tribunal in Tidewater.641\n635 CLEX-62, p. 200: \"This may be explained by the fact that firms' product mix and client base become more diversified\u00a0as they get larger.\"\n636 Hart I, p. 96.\n637 Hart II, para. 245.\n638 Hart II, para. 244.\n639 Hart II, para. 250: \"the countiy risk premia [.1 is an input that is not disputed between the experts.\"\n640 T, p. 1018, and H 4, slide 26.\n641 \"As a simple rule of thumb, when projects have infmite life, the capital maintenance expenditures should approach\u00a0depreciation.\" Cf. Damodaran, Aswath: Supporting Material to \"Corporate Finance: Theoiy and Practice,\" Wiley,\n2nd ed., 2001, available at http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/-adamodarlNew\\_Home\\_Page/CF2E.htm (Cf section \"3. Derivations and Discussion\"\u00a0of \"Chapter 9: Estimating Earnings and Cashflows on Projects\").\n138\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 141 of 201\n594. (iv) In the Joint Report, expert Hart set forth in writing that the country risk\u00a0premium could be any value between 4.6% and 14.75%, depending on how\u00a0many additional risks the Arbitral Tribunal decided to factor in.642\n595. The Arbitral Tribunal is not in agreement or disagreement on Hart's suggested\u00a0increase of the country risk rate to have that value reflect the risk of doing\u00a0business in Venezuela. The Arbitral Tribunal will merely have this award reflect\u00a0that expert Hart has failed to identify the components and amount of such\u00a0additional risk. Without this, the Arbitral Tribunal is unable to determine whether\u00a0such additional risk is or is not already accounted for in the beta or the size\u00a0premium.\n596. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal will use 4.6% as the country risk premium, as this is\u00a0a figure both experts have accepted as reasonable.\ne. Size Premium\n597. The Claimants' experts do not find it necessary to include a size premium,\u00a0whereas the Respondent's expert does indeed suggest adding a 2.73% premium.\u00a0The reason provided by expert Hart is that Tavsa is smaller than the average\u00a0company in the sample used to calculate the beta.\n598. The Claimants' experts do not categorically object to the use of size premiums,\u00a0but do question the contention that Tavsa is a small company since, as compared\u00a0to other companies operating in the same industry in Venezuela, it would not be\u00a0considered so.\n599. On this aspect, the Respondent is more convincing: the smaller the size, the\u00a0greater the investment's liquidity risk. If the companies used in the sample to\u00a0calculate the beta are, on average, larger or smaller than the company whose\u00a0WACC is being calculated, it seems reasonable to apply a size premium.\n600. To sum up, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided as follows:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The risk free rate is to be calculated based on a 10 -year bond, as suggested\nby the Claimant: 4.29%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The market risk premium is to be obtained through an arithmetic average,\nas suggested by the Respondent: 6.2%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appropriate beta is the Morningstar -adjusted beta, as recommended by\nthe Respondent: 2.2;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The country risk premium is 4.6%, as accepted by both parties' experts;\nand, lastly,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A size premium is to be applied, as suggested by the Respondent: 2.73%.\n642 Joint Report, para. 22.\n139\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 142 of 201\n601. Once the above parameters have been input into the WACC calculation\u00a0formula,643 the result is a rate of 2 1.7%.\n602. Next, the Arbitral Tribunal will list each of the decisions anived at in the\u00a0preceding paragraphs for the above -discussed variables:\n- Production: defined at 50,748 tons of tubes per year, as suggested by Venezuela;\n- Labor Cost Adjustment: the variable labor cost is reduced by 30% to account for the above -set production level;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Price: projected using the 30/70 formula negotiated with PDVSA, with the\ninternational reference price estimated based on the Metal Bulletin Research prices, as advocated for by the Claimant;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Opex: as calculated by the Claimant, based on the 2007 cost as increased\nper the expected inflation;\n- Technical Assistance Contract: the cost associated with this contract is to be included, as suggested by the Respondent, as this service can be\u00a0expected to continue to be needed;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capex: calculated as suggested by the Claimant, as this approach is\nconsistent with the standard valuation practice;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Working Capital: using the Respondent's figures, as the opposing\nassumptions are excessively risky;\n- WACC: 21.7%, with the Arbitral Tribunal choosing some parameters as suggested by the Claimants and others as suggested by the Respondent.\n603. The Arbitral Tribunal has incorporated these decisions into the spreadsheet\u00a0prepared by both experts, thus obtaining for the cash flows from May 2008 to\u00a0December 2017 a present value, as of April 30, 2008, of USD 132,342,506;\u00a0added to the present value of the terminal value of USD 28,151,108, this results\u00a0in a value for Tavsa of USD 160,493,614. After applying a 70% factor to reflect\u00a0the Claimant's interest, the result is USD 112,345,530.\n604. This is the market value of Tenaris' shareholding interest in Tavsa and the\u00a0amount the State of Venezuela is to pay it as compensation for its expropriation.\n643 For convenience reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal has input them into the spreadsheet jointly prepared by both experts.\u00a0140\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 143 of 201\n3.2 COMPARISON: OTHER APPROACHES\n605. In order to verify the value anived at through the DCF method, each expert has\u00a0suggested applying other additional approaches.\nA. Return on Investment\n606. Both Parties' experts have brought attention to the rate of return on the investment, which is implied in the compensation due to Tavsa: Hart asserts that\u00a0the rate of return is 485%,644 while Abdala/Zadicoff reduce it to 32.6%.645\n607. The Claimant's experts' approach is very valid, as it is interesting to measure the\u00a0relationship between what Tenaris invested and the value that is recognized to its\u00a0interest; however, the experts' calculations may not be taken into consideration\u00a0because they are based on the value estimated by Abdala/Zadicoff for Tavsa,\u00a0which the Tribunal has reduced significantly. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0will perform its own calculation of the investment's internal rate of return\u00a0['IRR\"I.\n608. It is undisputed that Tenaris' investments in Tavsa amounted to USD 11.7\u00a0million in 1999 for the purchase of stock and a total of USD 30.2 million spent\u00a0between 1999 and 2008 on capex and maintenance expenses.646\n609. Moreover, there were other companies in the Tenaris group that also received\u00a0income from Tavsa, as commission fees. According to expert Hart, such\u00a0commissions totaled 5% of Tavsa's annual revenue,647 and equal some USD 32\u00a0million between 1999 and 2008. In Hart's view, such commission fees are to be\u00a0accounted for as part of the return on the investment,648 while Abdala/Zadicoff\u00a0object to this, as they are not Tenaris' income from its investment in Tavsa.649\u00a0Given the circumstances of this case and considering that the companies that\u00a0received the commission fees were subsidiaries of Tenaris, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0agrees to have such income accounted for as part of the return on the investment.\n610. The investment's IRR is calculated including:\n- The price paid by Tenaris in 1999 to acquire its interests in Tavsa;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The investments made (assumed to be evenly distributed over time\nbetween 1999 and 2008);\n- The commission fees (which the Tribunal also assumes evenly spread over time between 1999 and 2008); and\n644 Hart II, para. 24.\n645 H 3, slide 24.\n646 Hart II, para. 217.\n647 Hart II, para. 217.\n648 Hart II, para. 217.\n649 H 3, slide 24.\n141\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 144 of 201\nIn 2008, a stream equal to Tenaris' stake in Tavsa, calculated via the DCF model (i.e., USD 112.3 million):\nStream in million USD\n1999\n11.52650\n2000\n0.18651\n2001\n0.18\n2002\n0.18\n2003\n0.18\n2004\n0.18\n2005\n0.18\n2006\n0.18\n2007\n0.18\n2008\n112.48652\nTIR\n29%\n611. The IRR on an investment with these features stands at about 29%.653 This rate is\u00a0to be compared with the return on equity included in the calculation of Tavsa's\u00a0WACC. The Arbitral Tribunal has used 25.26% (excluding the cost of debt),654\u00a0which is reasonably close to the ratio of Tenaris' investment to the returns\u00a0earned.\nB. Market Multinles\n612. This approach was proposed by the Claimant. It is about identifying ratios that\u00a0link the enterprise value to an accounting value (for instance, EBITDA); the next\u00a0step is calculating the average of such ratios at comparable companies, stated as\u00a0a multiple; that multiple is finally applied to the accounting value of the\u00a0company whose value is being assessed.\na. The Experts' Positions\n613. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff identified three market ratios (EV/EBITDA, EV/S ales\u00a0and EV/BVA), and then selected five companies as comparables. The experts\u00a0calculated the ratios for each company and then obtained a median, which was,\u00a0respectively, multiples of 8.1, 1.8 and 1.6 for each ratio. Applied to the value of\u00a0EBITDA, Sales and BVA of Tavsa in fiscal year 2007, these result in a value of\u00a0USD 226.6, 221.8 and 223.2 million, respectively;655 or USD 223.8 million on\u00a0average.\n650 -11.7 from the share purchase - 30.2/10 years of capex + 32/10 years of commission fees.\n651 - 30.2/10 years of capex + 32/10 years of commission fees.\n652 112.3 million from the compensation for expropriation - 30.2/10 years of capex + 30.2/10 years of commission fees.\n653 Calculated through the automated function on the Excel spreadsheet.\n654 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, WACC. The Claimant has estimated the return on equity at 17.79%, and the Respondent at\u00a025.45%. Because the Arbitral Tribunal has accepted some of the Claimant's assumptions and some of the Respondent's,\u00a0the final estimate is 25.26%.\n142\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 145 of 201\n614. The Respondent is not opposed to the idea of using market multiples for\u00a0comparison purposes, but notes that this needs to be done properly, and\u00a0identifies two major flaws in the Claimant's calculations:\n- The selected companies are not really comparable, as they are much larger than Tavsa, and cover markets very different from Tavsa's;\nThe ratio calculations were based on a single year - 2007 - instead of using several years and finding the average; in addition, the\u00a0selected year was an extraordinary year, based on results, and, in\u00a0any event, the financial statements have not been normalized to\u00a0ensure a comparison of homogenous magnitudes.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal's Decision\n615.

Tn contrast, Tavsa's figures are as follows: EBITDA: USD 31.3 million,657\u00a0Sales: USD 141.5 million,658 and BVA: USD 135.3 million.659 And the value\u00a0of Tavsa as arrived at through the DCF method stands at USD 160.5\u00a0million.660\n617. Tavsa's value, as derived by the Tribunal through the DCF approach, fits\u00a0the sample selected by the Claimant, as shown in the following charts,\u00a0prepared by the Arbitral Tribunal based on information supplied by the\u00a0Parties :661\n656 CLEX-3, Financial Data.\n657 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, FCF.\n658 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, FCF.\n659 Tavsa 2008 Joint Model, Historical Data - Tavsa.\n660 This is the full value of Tavsa, not just the Claimant' share.\n661 The information was taken from H 3, slides 18, 19, and 20, and the data on the Tavsa 2008 Joint Model. All data are\u00a0for 2007.\n143\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 146 of 201\n618. This first figure measures the value of Tavsa's equity as obtained through the DCF\u00a0method, expressed as a multiple of the book value of its assets. The multiple thus\u00a0obtained is 1 .2x.662 Tavsa ranks between comparables Tubos Reunidos (1 .4x) and\u00a0Artrom S .A. (lx). In the eight -company sample - itself included - it ranks sixth.\n619. This second chart measures the value of Tavsa's equity as arrived at through the\u00a0DCF method, expressed as a multiple of its EBITDA. The resulting multiple is\u00a05. 1x.3 Tavsa ranks between comparables Sanyo Special Steel (5.8x) and Gandhi\u00a0Special Tubes (4.4x). In the eight -company sample, it takes seventh place.\n662 160.5/135.3\n663 160.5/31.3\n144\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 147 of 201\n620. This third chart shows the value of Tavsa' s equity as anived at through the DCF\u00a0method, expressed as a Ilmultiple] of its sales revenue. This yields a multiple of\u00a01.1 x.664 This multiple places Tavsa between comparables Anhui Tianda (1 .4x) and\u00a0Sanyo Special Steel (0.7x). In the eight -company sample, it takes seventh place once\u00a0again.\n621. To conclude, Tavsa's value, as calculated by the Tribunal, ranks closer to the end as\u00a0compared to the reference companies, which shows that it is relatively low but still\u00a0within the limits set by these companies.\n622. The market multiples methodology thus confirms the reasonableness of Tavsa's\u00a0value as calculated through the DCF approach.\nC. ComDarable Transactions\n623. The Respondent has identified as comparable transactions the construction of a plant\u00a0in Mexico (a.) and the purchase of a plant in Indonesia (b.).\na. Construction of a Plant in Mexico\n624. In the first case, this is a construction project from 2008 that cost USD 850 million,\u00a0with a capacity of 450,000 tons per year. Based on his belief that this is 14% of\u00a0Tavsa's size, expert Hart estimates that building Tavsa anew would require an outlay\u00a0of USD 122.8 million, and 70% of that figure is USD 85.9 million.665\n625. The Claimant's experts have completed the information on this project, explaining\u00a0that it was completed in May 2011 and the investment reached USD 1 billion, and,\u00a0therefore, even accepting the relevance of the costs approach, the replacement value\u00a0for a 70% interest in Tavsa would be USD 124.4 million.666\n664 160.5/141.5.\n665 Hart II, para. 195.\n666 T., p. 868.\n145\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 148 of 201\n626. This replacement cost is a mere 10%667 below Tavsa's DCF value, which\u00a0conoborates the reasonableness of the figure anived at through the latter\u00a0methodology.\nb. Purchase of a Plant in Indonesia\n627. In the second case, in April 2009 Tenaris purchased a majority stake in an\u00a0Indonesian company with a production capacity of 120,000 tons per year, for\u00a0USD 72.5 million. Expert Hart believes the implied price of a company with\u00a0Tavsa's capacity would be USD 50.7 million.668\n628. The little information that has been supplied does not make it easy to ascertain\u00a0how comparable to Tavsa the Indonesian company really is.669 And the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal does not know either whether Tenaris undertook to make additional\u00a0investments in the Indonesian company, in addition to the purchase price.\n629. In sum, the Arbitral Tribunal confirms that the value of Tenaris' shares in Tavsa\u00a0totals USD 112,345,530.\n667 (112.3 - 124.4)/124.4 = 9.73%.\n668 Hart II, para. 196.\n669 T., p. 868.\n146\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 149 of 201\nVII.3.\n  \nCOMSIGUA'S VALUE\n630. Before determining the value of Comsigua (3.), the Arbitral Tribunal will first\u00a0set forth the position of the Claimant (1.) and, then, the position of the\u00a0Respondent (2.).\n1. THE CLAIMANT'S VALUE ASSESSMENT\n631. The Claimant's experts have calculated Comsigua's value based on the\u00a0discounted cash flows method (1.); but also using market multiples (2.). Lastly,\u00a0they have provided their opinion on Comsigua's value as implied by other\u00a0transactions (3.).\n1.1 DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS\n632. As already discussed in connection with Tavsa, this valuation approach consists\u00a0in estimating the future revenue stream (A.) and deducting outgoing cash flows\u00a0(B.). These net cash flows are generated in perpetuity at a growth rate, which\u00a0translates into a terminal value calculated as of 2017 (C.). The cash flows are\u00a0discounted at the appropriate discount rate to the valuation date, which is April\u00a030, 2008 (D.).\nA. Revenue\n633. Tavsa's revenue is determined by:67\u00b0 the expected sales of HBI (hot briquetted\u00a0iron) (a.) multiplied by the projected price (b.).\na. Iron Production\n634. Comsigua's Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) production was entirely dependent upon\u00a0the availability of iron ore pellets in the market, with CVG FMO and Sidor being\u00a0its only suppliers:671\nCVG FMO: experts Abdala/Zadicoff estimate that its production would have remained at its 2007 levels, to begin recovering in 2009 and then\u00a0reach its historical 3.08 million tons peak in 2015;672\nSidor: the experts have estimated production based on the five-year business plan prepared by Sidor itself in April 2008,673 deducting Sidor's\u00a0internal consumption of pellets.674\n635. The experts start from the assumption that the entire production of CVG FMO\u00a0and Sidor would be distributed on a pro rata basis (based on capacity) among\u00a0the four HBI producers,675 and that all of them would demand the amount of iron\n670\n671\n672\n67\n674\n675\n  \nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 147.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 149.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 150. 3cLEx37\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 151.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 152.

The experts' forecast is that Comsigua's production for 2008 would have been\u00a0400,000 tons, growing at an annual average rate of 12% for the following eight\u00a0years, reaching a maximum production level of 870,000 tons in 2015, which\u00a0would be sustainable over time.677 This forecast assumes that Comsigua would\u00a0be producing at maximum capacity (one million tons per year), but would not be\u00a0investing to increase its production capacity.678\nb. Projected Price\n637. The experts used the HBI price projections published for Venezuela by Metal\u00a0Bulletin Research as of the valuation date.679\n638. The experts' response to the criticism that they should have used historical HBI\u00a0prices is that the valuation of companies is a looking -forward exercise, and that\u00a0using projected future prices is a basic, standard principle in valuation\u00a0practice.68\u00b0\nB. ExDenditures\n639. Expenditures consist of operating expenses (opex) (a.), capital expenditures\u00a0(capex) (b.) and others (c.).\na. Opex\n640. Operating expenses consist of two categories:\nCosts of Goods Sold: the materials needed to produce HBI and other associated costs like, primarily, energy expenses.681 The future costs\u00a0estimation follows the following pattern: the experts take the cost on the\u00a0day preceding the valuation date and adjust that cost based on the expected\u00a0evolution of the international price of pellets, as well as the Venezuelan\n676 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 153. 677 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 155.\n678 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 156.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 147. 680 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 785.\u00a0681 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 159.\u00a0682 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 160.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 151 of 201\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: these are variable (depending on production683), semi -fixed, and fixed costs, and include\u00a0labor costs.684 They are expected to evolve in line with the Venezuelan\u00a0cpi.685\nb. Capex\n641. The experts base the capex on the historical average (2004-2007) capital investments, which are, primarily, maintenance expenses, and adjust these\u00a0looking forward based on the U.S. PPI.686\nc. Others\n642. As regards taxes, the assumptions are identical to those used for Tavsa:687 the science and technology tax (0.5% of gross income), anti -drug tax (1% of EBIT\u00a0minus interest) and corporate income tax (34% net of the anti -drug tax).688\n643. As to changes in working capital, experts Abdala/Zadicoff based their calculations on the observed behavior for 2005- 2007, such that accounts\u00a0receivable were estimated at 70 days of revenue, inventory at 65 days of costs of\u00a0goods sold, and accounts payable at 100 days of total yearly costs.689 Applying\u00a0these estimates, they anive at a working capital equal to 10 days of yearly\u00a0690\nrevenue.\nC. Terminal Value\n644. Terminal value is estimated as the value of the 2017 stream growing at a rate of\u00a02.4% in perpetuity. The 2.4% growth rate is consistent with the U.S. inflation\u00a0expectations.691 Terminal value is above USD 627 million692 -once discounted,\u00a0terminal value will be almost 40% 693 of the total enterprise value.\nD. Discount\n645. Many of the component elements of the WACC (as of April 30, 2008) are the\u00a0same as Tavsa's. Hence, the risk -free rate (4.29%), the market risk premium\u00a0(4.79%), the country risk premium (4.6%) and the cost of debt (10.4% before\u00a0taxes and 6.9% after taxes).\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 162.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 161.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 162.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 164.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 165.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 140.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 166.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 143.\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, para. 167.\nCLEX-4, FCF, Terminal value leaving the discount factor out.\nSee para. 648 infra.

The differences concern:\nThe beta calculation, due to the use of a different reference index, which, for Comsigua, is code SIC 3312, covering U.S. steel works, blast furnaces\u00a0and rolling mills ;694 the beta arrived at is 1.91 695\nThe optimal capital structure, which is based on that of companies listed under SIC 3312 - which is a debt -to -equity ratio of 22.8%;696 as of the\u00a0valuation date, Comsigua had no outstanding financial liabilities,697 but this\u00a0would not affect the optimal capital structure used to calculate the WACC:\u00a0in the experts' opinion, what is relevant is that the fair market value\u00a0approach assumes that the buyer would have valued the company on the\u00a0assumption that management would use an efficient capital structure.698\n647.

After discounting the annual cash flows between May 2008 and December 2017\u00a0to the valuation date, the experts anive at a value of USD 241.3 million, and to\u00a0be added to this is the discounted terminal value, which is USD 161.2 million; in\u00a0total, USD 402.5 million.700 After applying Talta's 7.58% interest, the value of\u00a0its share in Comsigua is USD 30.5 million.701\n1.2 MARKET MULTIPLES APPROACH\n649. This approach consists in identifying companies that are comparable to\u00a0Comsigua and deriving an average of the price/book value and EV/BVA\u00a0multiples as of April 30, 2008.702 The experts explain that, even though another\u00a0two ratios were used for Tavsa, which were related to EBITDA and sales, they\u00a0ruled these out for Comsigua. Due to exogenous factors not attributable to them,\u00a0such as the shortage of pellets in the domestic market, these ratios did not reflect\u00a0Comsigua's true production capacity.703\n650. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff resorted Midrex, which is the supplier of the\u00a0technology used in the process of iron oxide conversion into pellets (the stage\u00a0before HBI production), as Midrex publishes information on HBI plants\u00a0worldwide.704 Having determined which companies owned the plants, the\u00a0experts ruled out any companies that were not publicly listed and those whose\u00a0main business was not the production and sale of HBI.705 The sample came down\u00a0to five companies, from which the experts used data for the twelve months up to\u00a0March 31, 2008, or, where this was not possible, the information for the fiscal\u00a0year ended December 31, 2007.706\nMoItples Os oAprsl 2008\nBihar Sponge Iron Ltd\nIJX\n1.3x\nMonnet spat & Diergy Ltd\n2.3x\n.3x\nTata Sponge Iron, Ltd.\n1.Sx\nlix\nLloyds Metals & &orgy Limited\n4,4x\n2.Ox\nO,ss.

Next, the experts calculated the median for these companies' multiples, and\u00a0multiplied it by Comsigua's book value of assets and book value of equity.\u00a0However, the values that were used are not the ones disclosed on Comsigua's\u00a0financial statements, but other values that were calculated by the experts. The\u00a0reason underlying the decision to deviate from the accounting values is that the\u00a0experts do not trust the accounting methodology used by Comsigua.\n700 Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table IV, p. 31. \u00b0' Abdala/Zadicoff I, Table IV, p. 31.\n702 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 65.\n703 Abdala/Zadicoff I, para. 49.

However,\u00a0starting in 2003, Comsigua shifted to the \"m\u00e9todo integral mixto\" method,\u00a0whereby non -monetary holdings were valued by independent experts. In\u00a02003, and once again in 2006, Comsigua restated the value of its non -monetary assets, thereby increasing the book value of its assets, as reflected\u00a0in the \"unrealized profits\" item - as of December 31, 2007, this item\u00a0represented almost one half of the company's eqthly.707 The experts decided\u00a0to perform their own calculation of the value of non -monetary assets for the\u00a0period 2003 - 2008, using the general price level method:708 based on data\u00a0from the 2002 financial statements, the experts updated each asset using\u00a0Venezuela's official CPI, and deducted depreciation. 709\n652.

There are three transactions which are of interest and could be used as a\nreference to determine Comsigua's value.\nA. ReDurchase of Shares\n655. In May 2007, Comsigua and IFC (until then, a shareholder of Comsigua) signed\u00a0a share repurchase agreement. The implicit value of a 7.58% shareholding interest\u00a0would be USD 16.6 million.711\n656. This value is lower than the value anived at by experts Abdala/Zadicoff through\u00a0the DCF approach; however, the experts attribute this difference to the\u00a0improvement in market conditions between the date of the share repurchase\u00a0(May 2007) and the valuation date (April 2008).712 In fact, companies saw an\u00a0appreciation in value across the industry.713\n657. To verify the above assertions, the Claimant's experts engaged in the following\u00a0exercise: they performed a new DCF valuation of Comsigua as of May 2007, but\u00a0based on the price and cost estimates available on that date,714 and the result they\u00a0anived at is USD 18.6 million; this figure is reasonably close to the USD 16.6\u00a0million value implicit in the share repurchase transaction.715\nB. Comsiva' s Management' s Recommendation\n658. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff have not overlooked the agreement reached between\u00a0the State of Venezuela and the Japanese Shareholders who jointly held a 73.37%\u00a0stake in Comsigua. The State paid USD 209.6 million for these shares in 2011.\n659. Following the Japanese Shareholders' sale, the only private capital remaining at\u00a0Comsigua was the Claimant's. Comsigua's President had been negotiating with\u00a0Talta to purchase the latter's shares on terms equivalent to those underlying the\u00a0transaction with the Japanese Shareholders:\nUSD 24,058,737, with an initial payment of slightly over USD 8 million, and 10 half -yearly installments of USD 1,600,174 each, plus interest at 3%\u00a0p.m., even though Talta was required to provide a bond of 10% of the total\u00a0price to secure payment of the outstanding liabilities.\n\" Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 64.\n712 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 67.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 69.\nHRC prices at USD 305 per ton, growing at the 2% inflation rate; iron ore prices evolving in line with HRC; and WACC and macroeconomic expectations as of May 2007.\n715 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 67.\n153\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 156 of 201\n660. However, in order to be able to formalize the offer, Comsigua needed to secure\u00a0approval from higher authorities and it is for this reason that, on April 17, 2012,\u00a0Comsigua's President sent a letter to the President of CVG asking for\u00a0authorization to submit the proposal to the Minister of the People's Power for\u00a0Industry.716\n661. It is the view of experts Abdala/Zadicoff that this offer, which is framed on\u00a0terms similar to those of the transaction with the Japanese Shareholders, has the\u00a0same flaws as the latter does.717 The only aspect of note here is that Venezuela\u00a0was proposing compensation on a pro -rata basis, at the same price per share as\u00a0offered to each Japanese Shareholder; i.e. Venezuela failed to distinguish\u00a0between minority and majority shareholders and, therefore, it would be wrong to\u00a0apply a discount to the offered price, as this is a minority interest.718\nC. ExDroDriation of VenDrecar and Orinoco Iron\n662. According to the financial statements of International Briquettes Holding, the\u00a0sole shareholder of Venezolana de Prerreducidos CaronI, C.A. ['Venprecar\"I\u00a0and of Orinoco Iron S.C.S. ['Orinoco Iron\"I, the value of these two competitors\u00a0of Comsigua in June 2009 (before their expropriation) was USD 1,200 million,\u00a0or USD 382 per ton of production capacity per year.719\n663. Comsigua's historical capacity was close to 1.2 million tons per year; in their\u00a0discounted cash flows valuation, experts Abdala/Zadicoff assumed a production\u00a0capacity of 1 million. Comsigua's value as assessed by the experts through the\u00a0discounted cash flows approach is USD 402 per ton of capacity, or USD 335\u00a0considering the company's historical capacity - which figures are close to the\u00a0implicit value of the company as per the assessed value of Venprecar and\u00a0Orinoco Iron.72\u00b0\n2. \u00a0\u00a0THE RESPONDENT'S VALUE ASSESSMENT\n664. Expert Hart does not object to the use of the DCF (1.) or market ratios (2.) as\u00a0methods to assess Comsigua's value; he does, however, bring into question\u00a0certain assumptions or parameters used by the opposing experts. Even so, he still\u00a0prefers721 other methods to calculate the value (3.); specifically, the expert\u00a0analyzes the transaction with the Japanese Shareholders and the purchase price\u00a0recommended by Comsigua's management, but has also found other indications\u00a0of Comsigua's value.\n2.1 DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS\n665. There are three parameters Hart disagrees on:\n716 CRED-59.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, paras. 73, 76. 718 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 74.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 77. 720 Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 77.\n721 Hart II, para. 68.\n154\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 157 of 201\nA. Price\n666. The expert criticizes the fact that AbdalalZadicoff's price estimations are based\u00a0solely on the Metal Bulletin Research forecasts and, more specifically, that they\u00a0failed to take into consideration the historical evolution of HBI prices.722\n667. Hart takes issue with the fact that his colleagues failed to perform a historical\u00a0analysis of the HBI prices and also failed to provide evidence of the price\u00a0expectations used by Comsigua's management. 723 This is particularly relevant in\u00a0highly volatile periods or bubble periods,724 as was the case here: in 2008, which\u00a0is the starting point for the value assessment, future price projections showed an\u00a0upward trend, as HBI hit a historical peak in 2008. Using a very high price as the\u00a0starting point has caused the price estimations to be very high - even higher than\u00a0the historical average, and higher still than the actual prices from 2008\u00a0onwards.725\n668. In spite of this criticism, the expert has not provided the Arbitral Tribunal with\u00a0his best price estimates as of April 30, 2008, which is the valuation date.\nB. Discount Rate\n669. As already discussed in connection with Tavsa, Hart raises the same reservations\u00a0in connection with the calculation of Comsigua's discount rate:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The risk -free rate will be 45%;7\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The equity risk premium is set at 6.2%;727\n- The size premium is 2.73%;728\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The beta is to be adjusted by the Morningstar methodology, which takes\ninto consideration the beta coeffi ients and capital structure of SIC 3312 companies.729\n670.

The expert raises one additional important criticism: he rejects the proposed\u00a0capital structure consisting of 81% equity and 19% debt, for two reasons:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a minority shareholder, it is not reasonable to assume that the Claimant\ncould have altered the structure existing at the time, which was 100% equity;731\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The opposing experts' proposal is not acceptable either, considering that\nAbdala/Zadicoff claim that there is no outstanding financial debt.732\n672. According to Hart, the capital structure should be 100% equity, and, therefore,\u00a0the discount rate should be calculated as follows:733\nCost of equity =\n23.83%\nRisk -free rate\n4.5%\nMarket premium\n6.2%\nBeta\n1.94\nCountry risk premium\n4.6%\nSize premium\n2.73%\n2.2 MARKET MULTIPLES APPROACH\n673. According to theory, when there are comparable companies, the value of these\u00a0companies - stated as multiples of certain ratios - can be used to assess the value\u00a0of the company in question.734 The Claimants' experts, AbdalalZadicoff, have\u00a0applied this approach, using a five -company sample. Expert Hart does not agree\u00a0that all five companies selected by the opposing experts are truly comparable:735\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The five companies operate in India, a market with business risks different\nfrom those in Venezuela;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The selected companies produce sponge iron, while Comsigua produces\nHBI, which is the compressed variant of sponge iron, with higher\nproduction and capital costs;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reference companies use rotary kiln technology, while Comsigua has\nnatural gas furnaces using Midrex technology;\n' Hart I, para. 128.\n732 Hart I, para. 129.

Hart identifies three alternative indicators of Comsigua's value and provides his\u00a0opinion on a fourth alternative suggested by Abdala/Zadicoff.\nA. Comsiva's Management's Recommendation\n675. More than three years after the issue of the Nationalization Decree, on May 20,\u00a02011, the State signed a share purchase agreement with the Japanese\u00a0Shareholders, who held 73.37% of the company in total. The price paid for those\u00a0shares was USD 232.9 million:736\nThe USD 232.9 million price was to be paid as follows: an initial payment of USD 78 million upon execution, with 10 subsequent installments of USD\u00a015 million each every six months, plus interest at 3%; in turn, the sellers\u00a0were to contribute 10% of the price as a bond due to potential outstanding\u00a0liabilities.737\n676. On April 17, 2012, Comsigua's President sent a letter to the President of CVG738\u00a0recommending the purchase of Talta's shares in Comsigua on terms equivalent\u00a0to those agreed upon with the Japanese Shareholders:739\nThe price was USD 24 million, with an initial payment of USD 8 million and ten successive installments of USD 1.6 million plus interest at 3%; also,\u00a0Talta was required to set up a bond for 10% of the price to compensate for\u00a0potential liabilities of Comsigua.\n677. The Claimants' experts find this transaction not to be comparable, as it does not\u00a0reflect the market value. In any event, they have calculated the implicit value of\u00a0Talta's shares: in their first report, they estimated a value of USD 17.1 million\u00a0(considering only the transaction with the Japanese Shareholders);74\u00b0 and in their\u00a0second report, they raised that figure to USD 24.1 million (considering Talta's\u00a0offer).741\n678. Hart disagrees: he does find the transaction to be comparable, but does not agree\u00a0on the price estimate. In his opinion, the appropriate thing to do would be\u00a0discount the installments at 11.44%, which is the yield on the 4 -year Venezuelan\u00a0State bonds742 (four years being the maturity period that best approximates the\u00a0five-year payment stream), and adjust the value to reflect the contribution\u00a0towards liabilities and the discount for Talta's minority position. He thus arrives\u00a0at a value of USD 14.8 million.743\n736 Hart I, para. 120.

Hart I, para. 110.\n157\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 160 of 201\nB. Share ReDurchase\n679. In May 2007, Comsigua and IFC (one of Comsigua's private investors) signed a\u00a0share purchase agreement whereby the former would repurchase the latter's\u00a0stake in it. The price was USD 19 million for 4.75 million shares, or a price of\u00a0USD 4 per share. Applying this price to the Claimant's 4,140,055 shares, the\u00a0resulting figure is USD 16.6 million.744\n680. Abdala/Zadicoff argue that the difference between the value shown by this share\u00a0repurchase and the value anived at through the DCF approach is due to the\u00a0increase in HBI prices. But Hart is reluctant to accept this explanation without\u00a0having an exhaustive analysis showing that Comsigua's costs did not also\u00a0increase in line with the prices.745\n681. Hart further points out that Abdala/Zadicoff rely on the price increases of five\u00a0reference companies. But four of these companies are the ones already used\u00a0under the market ratios method and, as already discussed, Hart has reservations\u00a0regarding their comparable status.746\nC. ExDroDriation of VenDrecar and Orinoco Iron\n682. Hart does not believe that the expropriation of Venprecar and Orinoco Iron can\u00a0serve as an indicator of the compensation due to Comsigua.747\n683. Hart argues that the opposing experts have based their calculations of the value\u00a0of the companies on their capacity, but that equating capacity to value is\u00a0oversimplifying. First of all, because these calculations do not account for the\u00a0disparity in the capacities of the two companies (Venprecar 820,000 tons, as\u00a0compared to the 2.2 million tons of Orinoco fron); second, because there are\u00a0other estimation parameters as production and profitability, which are preferable\u00a0to capacity.748\nHart I, para. 104.\nHart II, para. 76. 746 Hart II, para. 79.\nHart II, para. 91. 748 Hart II, para. 91.\n158\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 161 of 201\n3. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL'S DECISION\n684. For Comsigua's valuation, the Arbitral Tribunal must preliminary decide on the\u00a0applicable valuation method, as the experts disagree on which method is the\u00a0most adequate one:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talta advocates for a DCF methodology, whereas\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent prefers extrapolating a value from other transactions.\n685. The Arbitral Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from the traditional DCF method\u00a0(1.), which has become a standard in the valuation of companies: in this case, the\u00a0company has a past history and future cash flows were predictable and can be\u00a0estimated in a reasonably accurate manner.\n686. That said, there is no reason keeping the Arbitral Tribunal from comparing the\u00a0value thus anived at to the result obtained through other methods (2.).\n3.1 DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS\n687. The Claimant's experts have assessed Comsigua's value by discounting its\u00a0future cash flows to valuation date, which is April 30, 2008. Their exercise is\u00a0similar to the one discussed in connection with Tavsa. The value they anive at is\u00a0USD 30.5 million.\n688. The Respondent has maintained that the conect valuation date is May 20, 2009.\u00a0However, in contrast with its position regarding Tavsa's valuation, it has not\u00a0subsidiarily provided an alternative valuation of Comsigua.\n689. In fact, the only parameter affecting Comsigua's value as of April 30, 2008 for\u00a0which expert Hart has supplied an alternative figure is the discount rate. Next,\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal will make a decision on the adequate rate, taking Hart's\u00a0criticism into consideration.\nA. Discount Rate\n690. The Claimant's experts have discounted the cash flows at Comsigua's WACC,\u00a0which, in their opinion, is 15.96%. The Respondent's expert has taken issue with\u00a0the use of the WACC as a discount rate as, in his opinion, using the return on\u00a0equity is more appropriate.\n691. The Arbitral Tribunal will then decide which of these two is the more\nappropriate rate (a.) and it will then decide what the value of that rate is (b.).\na. WACC or Return on Equity\n692. The Claimant's experts have calculated Comsigua's WACC to determine the\u00a0discount rate. That WACC is the weighted addition of the cost of debt and the\u00a0return on equity. The Claimant weights these two costs following an optimal\u00a0capital structure (19/81 debt/equity).749\nAbdala/Zadicoff I, p. 92.\n159\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 162 of 201\n693. The reason why the Respondent's expert does not think it best to use the WACC\u00a0as a discount rate is that Comsigua has no financial debt outstanding75\u00b0 and,\u00a0accordingly, he suggests leaving the cost of debt out and considering only the\u00a0return on equity.\n694. AbdalalZadicoffs counterargument is that the actual capital structure is inelevant in determining the market value, as the only decisive factor is the\u00a0structure a hypothetical buyer would have applied to assess a value estimate, and\u00a0that buyer would have always applied an optimal structure.751\n695. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimant's experts: the goal here is to\u00a0asses Comsigua's value by applying valuation standards, which include the\u00a0hypothesis that WACC is calculated based on an optimal capital structure. That\u00a0Comsigua has no debt outstanding and is financed 100% with equity capital does\u00a0not change this hypothesis.\n696. The same conclusion follows from mere internal consistency considerations: in\u00a0valuing Tavsa, which also had no financial debt, the Respondent agreed to have\u00a0its WACC include the company's cost of debt. The Respondent has argued that\u00a0Tavsa's case is distinguishable, as Tenaris held a majority interest and, therefore,\u00a0it could have imposed a change in the capital structure. This argument is\u00a0unpersuasive: each company should be applied its own WACC, inespective of\u00a0whether the shareholder holds a minority or a controlling interest in it.\nb. Rate\n697. In line with the preceding decision, the Arbitral Tribunal must now determine\u00a0what Comsigua's WACC is.\n698. This WACC is derived from the following parameters:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk -free rate;\n- Market premium;\n- Beta;\n- Country risk premium; and, if applicable,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Size premium;\n\u00b0 Note that Tavsa holds no financial debt either; Hart does not object to using the WACC for Tavsa as, in his view, because Tenaris had a control position in Tavsa, it could impose the capital structure it found most appropriate, as just\u00a0another strategic decision - which would not be possible at Comsigua, where Talta holds a minority interest.\n' Abdala/Zadicoff II, para. 106.\n160\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 163 of 201\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cost of debt;\n- Optimal capital structure.\n699. The Parties' experts are in disagreement as to the amount of each of the above\u00a0parameters, and their points of disagreement are identical to those that were\u00a0discussed for Tavsa's valuation. Consequently, the decisions made in that\u00a0connection752 are fully applicable here:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk -free rate: the Tribunal has elected the 10 -year bonds, as suggested by\nthe Claimant, at a rate of 4.29%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market premium: the Tribunal has opted to use the arithmetic average, as\nsuggested by the Respondent, which results in 6.2%;\n- Beta: the Tribunal has prefened the Morningstar -adjusted beta, as suggested by the Respondent, which is 1.94;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Country risk premium: the Tribunal has used a premium of 4.6%, which is\nthe rate accepted by both experts;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Size premium: the Tribunal has accepted the application of this 2.73%\npremium, as suggested by the Respondent. 756\n700. The above parameters are the inputs in the return on equity formula:\nKerf\u00b1f3(rm rf)\u00b1pc\u00b1ps\nWhere r is the risk -free rate, is the beta coefficient, y rm - r is the market risk premium, pc is the country risk premium, and ps is the size premium.\nThis results in a return on equity of:\n4.29% + 1.94 x 6.2% + 4.6% + 2.73%; i.e., 23.65%.\n701. As to the net cost of debt, it stands at\n702. The optimal capital structure is 19/8 1 debt/equity.758 And this leads to a WACC\u00a0of 20.47 %759\n752 See para. 600 supra.

The Arbitral Tribunal has used the Comsigua cash flows spreadsheet submitted\u00a0as Exhibit CLEX-4 as basis, and substituted the discount rate proposed in that\u00a0spreadsheet with a rate of 20.47%, as per the above decision.\n704. This leads to a present value of the cash flows generated between 2008 and 2017\u00a0of USD 208.7 million, and a terminal value of USD 85.3 million; in total, a\u00a0value of USD 294 million for Comsigua as of April 30, 2008. Applying 7.58%\u00a0to this value to account for the Claimant's shareholding, we arrive at USD 22.3\u00a0million.\n3.2 OTHER APPROACHES\n705. The Arbitral Tribunal has decided to assess Comsigua's value by applying the\u00a0DCF methodology. This, however, does not exclude the need to use other\u00a0approaches to compare the value thus anived at. The Tribunal will analyze these\u00a0next.\nA. Market MultiDles\n706. This approach was proposed by the Claimant.\n707. Its experts selected the following comparable companies:76\u00b0\nEnterprise Value\nMarket Capitalizalio\nBook Value of Equity\nBook Value of Assets\nAs ofApi/ 2008\nUS$ Mi//ion\nUS$ Mi//ion\nUS$ Mi//ion\nUS$ Mi//ion\nBihar Sponge Iron Ltd\n9530\n65.15\n3365\n748!\nMornet Lpat & Energy Ltd\n80325\n62276\n27476\n629.5!\nTata Sponge Iron, Ltd.\n12582\n109.31\n6088\n11845\nLloyds Metals & Energy Limited\n23932\n19147\n4396\n12123\nOrissa SpogeIro & Steel\n18144\n11850\n3973\n11003\n708. As per their own calculations, as of April 30, 2008, the adjusted book value of\u00a0Comsigua's equity was USD 172 million761 and the adjusted book value of its\u00a0assets was USD 253.9 million.762\n709. The following charts, prepared by the Arbitral Tribunal based on the data\u00a0supplied by the Claimants, compare the EV/BVA and Price/BYE ratios\u00a0(provided by the Claimant) to Comsigua's ratio, calculated by dividing the DCF\u00a0value (USD 294 million) by the adjusted book value of equity (USD 172\u00a0million) and the adjusted book value of assets (USD 253.9 million):\n760 CLEX-5, Financial Data.\n761 Abdala/Zadicoff I, p. 37.\n762 Abdala/Zadicoff I, p. 38.\n162\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 165 of 201\nComsigua: Market Multiples Approach\n710. The first chart shows the value of Comsigua' s equity, as arrived at through the DCF,\u00a0stated as a multiple of the book value of its assets. The multiple is 1. lx.763 Comsigua\u00a0ranks last, as it has the lowest multiple among the five comparables.\n711. The second chart features the value of Comsigua' s equity, as arrived at through the\u00a0DCF approach, stated as a multiple of the book value of its equity. The multiple is\u00a01 .7x.764 Again, Comsigua ranks last relative to its comparable companies.\n712. To conclude, the charts show that Comsigua ranks at the bottom, even though not far\u00a0from the reference companies. The Arbitral Tribunal would have expected its value\u00a0to place it on a more central position, as would have been the case with a multiplier\u00a0of 1.25x for the BVA and 2x for the BYE.\n763 294/253.9. 294/172.\n163\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 166 of 201\n713. Applying a BVA multiplier of 1.25x and a BYE multiplier of 2x, the value of\u00a0Talta's interest in Comsigua is USD 24.06 million765 and USD 26.08 million.766\nB. ComDarable Transactions\n714. The Parties have refened to three potentially -comparable transactions: the\u00a0purchase of IFC's shares, the valuation of Venprecar and Orinoco Iron, and,\u00a0lastly, the one the Parties have paid the most attention to: the compensation paid\u00a0to the Japanese Shareholders.\na. The Purchase of IFC's Shares\n715. Hart, the Respondent's expert, has addressed the May 2007 transaction whereby\u00a0Comsigua repurchased a shareholder's (IFC) 4.75 million shares for a price of\u00a0USD 19 million. Applying the same price, the value of the Claimant's 7.58%\u00a0shareholding would be USD 16.6 million.\n716. The Claimant's experts have pointed out that the market circumstances in May\u00a02007 and April 2008 are not comparable: because the price of HBI (Comsigua's\u00a0product) increased by 40% that year,767 companies in this sector experienced a\u00a0marked appreciation in their value, which the experts have estimated at 74% to\u00a0140%.768\n717. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts the Claimant's experts' criticism, and it is its view\u00a0that Comsigua's implicit value as per the May 2007 IFC transaction cannot per\u00a0se be used as indicative of the company's value in April 2008, without applying\u00a0the necessary adjustments:\nBy the mere lapse of time: if the May 2007 value is capitalized at the discount rate used in the DCF exercise, the value goes from USD 16.6\u00a0million to 20 million.769\nBy the increased price of HBI: using the comparable company that showed the least appreciation as per the experts' calculation (74%) as reference,\u00a0and applying that figure to the May 2007 value, the value as of April 2008\u00a0is USD 28.88 million.770\n765 USD 253.9 million x 1.25 \\* 7.58%. For its calculations, the Arbitral Tribunal has used the full figures in the data provided by the experts, even though the Award only shows rounded -up amounts.\n766 USD 172 million x 2 \\* 7.58%.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers the IFC transaction to be an indicator of the\u00a0value of the Claimant's investment in Comsigua as of April 30, 2008 between\u00a0USD 20 million and 29 million.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0The Value of Venprecar and Orinoco Iron\n719. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff refened to the valuation of Venprecar and Orinoco Iron\u00a0which, as per their parent's financial statements, was USD 1.2 billion in June\u00a02009. To find a point of comparison, the Claimant decides to translate that value\u00a0into a price per ton produced. Applying this price per ton produced to\u00a0Comsigua's production, the value of Tavsa's interest in Comsigua would be\u00a0USD 29 million.771\n720. The Respondent finds the notion of stating the value in terms of capacity overly\u00a0simplistic, particularly considering the differences between each company's\u00a0plants' capacity.\n721. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees that tying value to production capacity is a\u00a0simplification and, therefore, it will give prevalence to other comparable\u00a0transactions in setting Comsigua's value.\nc. The Purchase of the Japanese Shareholders' Shares\n722. In May 2011, CVG purchased the shares of a group of Japanese Shareholders,\u00a0who held 73.37% of Comsigua's shares, in the aggregate, for USD 232.9\u00a0million.772 The same economic terms of the transaction with the Japanese\u00a0Shareholders are the terms underlying the recommendation made by CVG' s\u00a0management on April 17, 2012 for the purchase of Talta's shares for USD 24\u00a0million, with an initial payment of USD 8 million and the remaining USD 16\u00a0million payable in ten half -yearly installments, at 3% interest, and the furnishing\u00a0of a bond by Talta.\n723. In expert Hart's view, this transaction773 is a good indication of Comsigua's\u00a0value, which would be USD 14.76 million in April 2012:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0USD 21.15 million for the offered price, with each installment discounted\nat the yield on Venezuelan bonds (11.44%), plus 3% interest;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minus USD 2.4 million to account for the fact that Talta was required to\nset up a bond for 10% of the offered price in order to cover potential liabilities of Comsigua;\n' H 3, slide 28.\n772 Hart I, para. 105.\nBecause the terms were identical, both Parties' experts have considered only one transaction. Hart I, Annex 4.\n165\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 168 of 201\nMinus 2 1.26% as a minority interest discount.\n724. Experts Abdala/Zadicoff refuse to recognize any reliability at all to this approach\u00a0as, in their view, it is a forced sale to the State that cannot be indicative of the\u00a0fair market value, which is the value we are trying to determine. Moreover, they\u00a0bring the Respondent's calculations into question.775\nThe Arbitral Tribunal's Position\n725. The Tribunal will first determine what the conect value of the compensation\u00a0proposed by the State is.\n726. The starting point must be the calculation performed by expert Hart, who is the\u00a0expert who has performed a more in-depth analysis of this purchase as indicative\u00a0of Comsigua' s value:776\nP,il\nS\n14.010,737\n11.44%\n11/11/2014\n3/15/1011\n11/15/2015\n5/15/ltfl\n11/15/2016 5/13/201?\nP.Vnw,tOU.\nS/IS/ZOfl\n11/15/2012\n5/15,2013\n11115/1015\nSf1512014\nU,0I&fl3.00 S\n1,00.174.40\nS\nUOO,274.40 $\n1400,t74,4O S\n1.e0O,174,40\nS 1.000.174.40 S\n2.00,174,4O\n$ MOO,174.40\n1.600,174,40\nS 1.600474.40 $ 1.100,274.40\n24.I,7j7.00\ni,,!.nS.I1M.\nS\n15.001,744.00\n14,lflSO.eO S\ntaSOLrn,N S\n11.WLZIO!0\n$ 9,WL0$3.IQ $\n3.00057200\n5 b,400$97.bO\n$ 1$00.Sl3.20\n3,200.341.30 5 1(00,17410\nInh.nM P.y,wt\nS\n2IO.OU 16\n5\n21&O2S54 5\n192,02093 S\n1\\*3.0)851\nS 144.01570 $\n120,01.0U\nS %.O1O.46\n$ 73.007AS\nS ls.00s.l S 2400262\n$ 1520.11318\nT,t.g S\n&,oS6SSI 00\nS 25,flS,fl0.0\nCtbtj0,ttkbjI,tj,,' \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0S 2.105.17370\nN.IR.(0,S.dPdC\\* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$ %S,714,135U\nS 3,IRS.fl044\nOiICQODt $ l4,JS9,OS,\n727. The Arbitral Tribunal will now analyze the criticisms raised by Abdala/Zadicoff:\n(i) Offered Price\n728. The Claimant notes that the price considered by Hart is USD 10 million lower\u00a0than the price offered.\n729. The Arbitral Tribunal believes the criticism might stem from the fact that the\u00a0final price discounted and adjusted by Hart is USD 14,759,605, when the\u00a0nominal offer was for USD 24,058,737.\n730. The criticism is not acceptable. The exercise consists, precisely, in finding out\u00a0what the price the State was willing to pay for Talta's shares in Comsigua in a\u00a0single payment back in April 2012 was. And, in any event, to clear any doubts,\u00a0the figure in the last column, which is the undiscounted principal sum, is USD\u00a024,058,737.\nAbdala/Zadicoff II, para. 74.\n776 Hart I, Annex 4.\n166\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 169 of 201\n(ii) Interest\n731. Abdala/Zadicoff complain that expert Hart did not include interest, even though\u00a0the offer provided for the accrual of interest.\n732. Indeed, the offer provided as follows:777\n\"Ten (10) half -yearly, consecutive installments, represented by 10 promissory notes for the sum of USD 1,600,174.00 each. In addition to each installment,\u00a0there shall be added the interest accrued on each promissory note at the time of\u00a0effective payment, accrued at a rate of 3% pa.\"\n733. The Arbitral Tribunal fails to fully comprehend Abdala/Zadicoff's criticism, as\u00a0expert Hart has clearly included the accrued interest in his calculations. And he\u00a0calculated interest as follows:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He used, as principal, the outstanding amount of the full agreed -upon price;\n- He applied a simple interest calculation method;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The accrual period is always six months.\n734. This method is conect.\n(iii) Discount\n735. The next step is to discount each interest payment and the payment of the USD\u00a01,600,174 installment to the initial date.\n736. Expert Hart used a rate of 11.44%, which is the equivalent of the yield of the 7 -year Venezuelan bonds.778 The Claimant questions the suggestion that the\u00a0discount rate needs to be adjusted to reflect a collection risk from Venezuela.779\n737. The Arbitral Tribunal does not agree with either Party:\nIt disagrees with the Claimant, because payments by the State must be discounted at a rate that represents the risk of the transaction, i.e. the rate\u00a0applied to State bonds with a similar maturity period, which, in this case, is\u00a0five years.\nBut it does not agree with the Respondent that its suggested 11.44% reflects the sovereign debt yield on a five-year investment. To begin with,\u00a0expert Hart claims to have used the yield on seven-year bonds,78\u00b0 even\u00a0though the transaction had a period of five years (up to 2017); moreover,\u00a0there were sovereign debt bonds in the market -T1CC042017 (6.25%\u00a0coupon) and PDVSA 2017 - October 2010 (5.25% coupon) and PDVSA\u00a02017N - October 2011(8.5% coupon) - which matured, precisely, in 2017\nCRED-59, p. 4\n778 T., p. 1030:20.\nT., p. 872:18-21.\n780 T., p. 1030; even though in Hart I, para. 110, he refers to a four-year bond.\n167\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 170 of 201\nand which, therefore, seem to be more adequate to calculate the discount rate. Lastly, the Arbitral Tribunal has doubts as to whether the suggested\u00a011.44% has been conectly calculated. 781\n738. The Arbitral Tribunal believes that a discount rate of 6.25% adequately reflects\u00a0the risk of a sale of shares in 2012, where the price of the securities would be\u00a0paid over a period of five years.\n739. The amount of the installment payments and the interest, discounted to the initial\u00a0date at 6.25%, is USD 14,768,469.782\n740. To be added to this sum is still the agreed -upon initial payment of USD\u00a08,056,993. In total, USD 22,825,462. This was the price offered by the State, for\u00a0a single payment (rather than installments).\n(iv) Bond\n741. Expert Hart deducts, off the discounted price, 10% of the offered price, to\naccount for the bond to be furnished by Talta.\n742. The Claimant does not deny that the bond was a requirement of the offer; its\u00a0argument is that the Japanese Shareholders got full compensation, without a\u00a0deduction on account of the bond,783 and that Talta should be applied the same\u00a0terms. It further notes that, at the time when the offer was made, it was uncertain\u00a0that the bond would have to be enforced due to any liabilities materializing.784\n743. The Arbitral Tribunal takes note of the fact that the offer provides as follows:785\n\"TALTA - Trading e Marketing, Lda. is to furnish CVG with a Bond in a sum equal to 10% of the full price amount (USD 2,405,873.74), to\u00a0guarantee the effective payment of all liabilities that arise or may arise on a\u00a0date after the execution of the Share Assignment Agreement, in connection\u00a0with its management.\"\n744. The offer also mentions that the purchase of Talta's shares is done:786\n\"[..J on the same conditions on which the Japanese companies' shares were negotiated.\"\n781 Hart I, para. 110 refers to CRED-32, which seems to be a printout of a webpage (which the expert claims is\u00a0investing.com, even though this is not shown in the printout) showing the yields of Venezuelan bonds with two, four\u00a0(11.435% yield), six, 15 and 20 year maturity periods; however, it does not show the date on which those yields were\u00a0calculated. The Arbitral Tribunal visited investing.com (the same source used by the expert) and checked the yields of\u00a0Venezuelan bonds a year ago (as the page does not provide data further back in time), and the figure shown for five-year\u00a0bonds is exactly 11.435%; which raises the suspicion that expert Hart, who prepared his report in October 2014, used the\u00a0yield on 2014 bonds, not 2012 bonds.\n782 The Arbitral Tribunal has discounted each payment calculated by expert Hart via the formula (1+6%) \"- n, where n is\u00a0the time elapsed from May 15, 2012 to the date of payment.\n783 T., pp. 1208, 1209.\n784 T., p. 1209.\n785 CRED-59, p. 5.\n786 CRED-59, p. 4.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 171 of 201\n745. The Arbitral Tribunal has analyzed the language of the offer and the Parties'\u00a0arguments and, once again, partially agrees with each Party:\nThe Claimant is right to reject a price deduction for 100% of the amount of the bond: the offer did not provide for a price reduction, but for a bond,\u00a0which might or might not be enforced, based on the materialization of\u00a0hidden liabilities; however, the fact that the Japanese Shareholders did or\u00a0did not have their bond enforced is inelevant as those are subsequent\u00a0events that were unknown at the time.\nThe Respondent is right that the provision of a bond has the effect of reducing the value of the offer, as there is a risk that the bond will, in fact,\u00a0be enforced - what needs to be determined is how probable it was that\u00a0hidden liabilities would materialize over the four years of the bond's\u00a0effective period. At the Hearing, the Arbitral Tribunal raised this issue to\u00a0expert Hart, suggesting the application of a 50% reduction factor;787 the\u00a0expert replied that it is very difficult to make this sort of assessment, but\u00a0did not rule out the suggested percentage as being absurd. This will then be\u00a0the percentage the Tribunal will apply.\n746. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal has estimated that, if the amount covered by the bond\u00a0was USD 2,405,874, its effect on the price will then be a reduction by one half of\u00a0its value (USD 1,202,937). The offered price is then assessed at USD\u00a02 1,622,525.788\n(v) Minority Share Discount\n747. The next adjustment applied by Hart is a price reduction to reflect the fact that\u00a0Comsigua is a minority shareholder. Talta objects, basically arguing that\u00a0compensation should be paid to all shareholders alike, inespective of whether\u00a0they are majority or minority shareholders and, in fact, so was done with the\u00a0Japanese Shareholders (who, individually, were minority shareholders).\n748. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Talta. The State's offer did not mention any\u00a0discount and, therefore, there is no reason to believe that there was one implied:\u00a0the offer was what it was. Moreover, the Claimant is completely right to point\u00a0out that the Japanese Shareholders were paid a single price, without\u00a0discriminating between those who were selling a larger or a smaller\u00a0shareholding, as all of them were individually minority shareholders, just like\u00a0Comsigua.\n749. It is thus inconect to apply any additional adjustment to the price. The value of\u00a0Talta's interest in Comsigua, as implicit in the Government's purchase offer, is\u00a0USD 21,622,525 USD.\n787 T., pp. 1210-1212.\n788 USD 22,825,462 - 1,202,937.\n169\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 172 of 201\n750. The Arbitral Tribunal has before it different calculations which are, more or less\u00a0reliably, indicative of Comsigua' s value:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market multiples: between USD 24.06 million and 26.07 million, or USD\n25.065 million on average;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purchase of IFC's shares: between USD 20 million and 29 million, or USD\n24.5 million on average;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Value of Venprecar Orinoco Iron: USD 29 million;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compensation paid to the Japanese Shareholders: USD 21.62 million.\n751. The above approaches show that the value arrived at through the discounted cash\u00a0flows method (USD 22.3 million) is on the low end and, therefore, needs to be\u00a0increased.\n752. In order to determine the amount of that increase, the Arbitral Tribunal has\u00a0decided to set an order of priority for the above discussed indicators:\n(i) topmost is the compensation paid to the Japanese Shareholders, which represents the value the State attributed to their shareholdings. However,\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal also accepts the criticism that this is not indicative of\u00a0a fair market value, but the price of a forced sale and, therefore, it will treat\u00a0this price as an indication of the minimum value of Talta's share in\u00a0Comsigua, assigning it a weight of 0.3;\n(ii) next is the purchase of IFC's shares, as it is indicative of the value of Comsigua at a time prior to the expropriation, but under market\u00a0circumstances that were less favorable than those at the time of the\u00a0expropriation; therefore, the Tribunal will assign it a weight of 0.26;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iii) the reliability of market multiples is more limited, as there is no\nevidence that the experts have normalized the data, and their weight is thus 0.24; and\n(iv) lastly, the value of Venprecar and Orinoco Iron, because the Arbitral Tribunal believes that expressing value in terms of production capacity is\u00a0an exercise of questionable reliability, and therefore assigns it a weight of\u00a00.2.\n753. Using the above order of priority, the Arbitral Tribunal has applied the weight\u00a0factors to the relevant value:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compensation paid to the Japanese Shareholders: 0.3 x USD 21.62 million;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purchase of IFC's shares: 0.26 x USD 24.5 million;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market multiples: 0.24 x USD 25.065 million;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Value of Venprecar and Orinoco Iron: 0.2 x USD 29 million.\n170\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 173 of 201\n754. The result of the above weighting exercise is that the value of Talta's share in\u00a0Comsigua is USD 24,672,357.\n755. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the market value of the Claimants' shareholding\u00a0in Comsigua (USD 24,672,357) is higher than the USD 24.1 million offered by\u00a0the Republic. Therefore, as pointed out by the Claimants, there is no need for the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal to rule on the subsidiary claims based on the unfair and\u00a0inequitable treatment, discriminatory treatment, and breach of the most -favored\u00a0nation clause allegations.789\n789\n  \nCV, para. 321.\n  \n171\n  \nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 174 of 201\nVIII. INTEREST\n756. The Claimants have requested an interest award.\n757. Interest accrual is an issue addressed in the BITs:\nThe Portuguese BIT provides that \"compensation will accrue interest at the exchange rate applicable at the date in which the transaction becomes\u00a0effective, in the territory where the investment is located\".790\nPursuant to the Luxembourg BIT, \"interest on compensationi shall be paid at the normal commercial rate from the date of its determination to the date\u00a0of payment\".791\n758. The Parties disagree on the applicable interest rate.\n1. THE CLAIMANTS\n759. The Claimants argue that, whatever the applicable interest rate is, it must\u00a0guarantee full compensation; in other words, the Claimants are to be placed in a\u00a0position equal to the position they would be in had the wrong not taken place. 792\n760. It is the Claimants' view that the rate that provides full compensation is the one\u00a0reflecting the cost of opportunity lost by not having had the funds due them\u00a0available, i.e. the WACC,793 not a risk -free rate:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BITs do not mention a risk -free rate;794\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants have de facto lent money to Venezuela and, therefore, there\nis no reason to apply a risk -free rate to that loan, as the cost of Venezuela's debt has been much higher (9.8% in April 2OO8);\nArbitral awards have repeatedly held that a risk -free rate does not apply; rather, the applicable rate is one that compensates for the loss of\u00a0investment opportunities during the time over which the compensation was\u00a0due but not paid;796\n- Hart himself applied a rate of 11.44% to discount the installment payments in the transaction with the Japanese Shareholders.797\n761. The Claimants have also requested that interest be compounded,798 as compound\n\u00b0 Portuguese BIT, Article IV.1(c).\n' Luxembourg BIT, Article 4.2.\n792 CV, para. 297.\nCV, para. 297.\nCV, para. 300.\nCV, para. 301.\n796 CV, paras. 298, 299.\nCV, para. 302.\n798 CV, para. 303.\n172\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 175 of 201\ninterest is the computation method that best provides full reparation for the loss, as has been acknowledged in previous awards.799 The BITs' mention of a\u00a0\"normal commercial rate\" means that they are refening to compound interest.800\u00a0Compounding should be annual, since the cost of equity is measured using the\u00a0expected annual returns as basis.801\n2. THE RESPONDENT\n762. The quantum expert hired by Venezuela objects to the Claimants' proposals.\n763. Hart notes that he agrees that the Claimants be paid interest if the Award orders\u00a0compensation, but granting interest at the WACC is entirely inappropriate. 802\n764. Hart analyzed the provisions of the BITs on the subject of interest and found that\u00a0the \"normal commercial\" rate means the late interest rate applicable on trade\u00a0transactions.803 The expert advocates for the use of the interest rate used in\u00a0Comsigua's shareholder agreements (six-month LIBOR + 2% p.a.) as the\u00a0reference rate.804\n765. However, the expert is also for applying a different alternative interest rate, as it\u00a0is the one most frequently used in ICSID awards: the yield on 10 -year U.S.\u00a0Treasury Bonds.805\n766. Faced with the opposing experts' suggestion to apply the WACC as the interest\u00a0rate, the expert is surprised and claims to know of no awards granting interest at\u00a0such rate;806 the expert argues that, in Saur, the arbitral tribunal did not use the\u00a0WACC as the interest rate but applied the rate the parties had agreed upon as the\u00a0guaranteed rate of return.807\nCV, paras. 304, 305. 800 CV, para. 306.\u00a0801 CV, para. 308.\u00a0802 Hart II, para. 199.\u00a0803 Hart II, para. 202.\u00a0804 Hart II, para. 203.\u00a0805 Hart II, para. 204.\u00a0806 Hart II, para. 181.\u00a0807 Hart II, para. 207.\n173\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 176 of 201\n767. As to whether interest is to be compounded, Venezuela argues that neither the\u00a0BITs808 nor well -established practice provide for this possibility,809 and further\u00a0claims that simple interest does provide full reparation.81\u00b0\n3. \u00a0\u00a0THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL'S DECISION\n768. The BITs contain a generic agreement as to the applicable interest rate. Such rate\u00a0must be:\n- A normal commercial rate,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, as specified in the Portuguese BIT, it must be the rate applicable in\nVenezuela.\n769. However, within that framework, the Arbitral Tribunal has discretion to\u00a0determine the interest rate. In this case, the experts' proposals range between:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The WACC for the compensation due for Tavsa' s expropriation and the\ncost of equity for Comsigua's case;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LIBOR for six-month USD deposits + 2%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The yield on 10 -year U.S. Treasury Bonds.\n770. The Tribunal is not of the opinion that WACC and the yield on U.S. Treasury\u00a0Bonds are \"normal commercial rates\" \"applicable in Venezuela,\" as required by\u00a0the BITs and, therefore, it rejects their application. However, the Tribunal\u00a0believes that LIBOR plus a margin would indeed satisfy these requirements:\nIt is a normal commercial rate: LIBOR is the interest rate applied in the London interbank market, and is set on a daily basis by the British\u00a0Bankers' Association for interbank deposits with different maturity\u00a0periods, denominated in various cunencies; it is universally accepted as the\u00a0reference rate to set interest rates on loans, deposits and other financial\u00a0instruments and, in financial practice, bank loans to customers accrue\u00a0interest at the interbank LIBOR plus a margin.\nIt is a rate applicable in Venezuela: economic players in Venezuela frequently use LIBOR, as shown by the fact that clause 9 of Addendum\u00a0No. 5 to Comsigua's Shareholders' Agreement811 uses LIBOR for the\u00a0interest accrued on the sums owed by the shareholders to Comsigua or vice\u00a0versa.\n771. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that the late interest to be paid by\u00a0Venezuela accrue based on the LIBOR rate for dollar -denominated one-year\u00a0deposits, with the rate adjusted to reflect market changes, yearly in anears.\n808 RV, para. 268.\n809 RV, para. 270.\n810 RV, para. 269.\n811 CLEX-19.\n174\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 177 of 201\n772. Still to be defined is the appropriate margin above LIBOR. Expert Hart proposes\u00a02%. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that this figure, which may very well have been\u00a0appropriate under different economic circumstances, is not so in the light of\u00a0cunent circumstances, where interest rates are typically extremely low (even\u00a0negative). Therefore, the Tribunal considers a 4% margin to adequately\u00a0compensate the investor for the unavailability of the funds and the financial risks\u00a0faced.\n773. Lastly, the Tribunal must determine whether interest is to be compounded after a\u00a0given period. The BITs are silent on the matter. It is the Tribunal's view that in a\u00a0LIBOR -based interest calculation, compounding is financially essential to\u00a0compensate the investor. Indeed: the goal of interest is to compensate for the\u00a0outside financial cost the Claimant would hypothetically have incuned to cover\u00a0the deficit caused by the delayed compensation payment. Had the Claimant\u00a0bonowed on normal market conditions at LIBOR for one year, it would have\u00a0had to pay interest annually from the dies a quo; otherwise, such interest would\u00a0have been added to the principal, thereafter accruing interest in turn. Therefore,\u00a0in order to fully compensate the Claimant, the award must allow the annual\u00a0compounding of interest.\n774. Finally, the Tribunal has verified that the Claimants have simultaneously asked\u00a0for compensatory and late interest.812\n775. To conclude, the Arbitral Tribunal's decision is as follows:\n- Interest accruing on a principal of USD 1 12,345,530 ['Tavsa Interest\"I and USD 24,672,357 ['Comsigua Interest\"I;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tavsa Interest and Comsigua Interest will accrue at a rate equal to LIBOR\nfor one-year USD deposits + 4% p.a.;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tavsa Interest and Comsigua Interest will accrue from April 30, 2008 to\nthe date of actual payment, with the interest rate redefined yearly as from such date;\n- Accrued Tavsa Interest and Comsigua Interest will be compounded annually, at the same time as the new interest rate is set for the upcoming\u00a0period;\n- Tavsa Interest will be paid to Tenaris, and Comsigua Interest will be paid to Talta, in line with the Arbitral Tribunal's decision in paragraph 402\u00a0supra.\n812\n  \nCI, para. 231.\n  \n175\n  \nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 178 of 201\nIX. TAXES\n776. The Parties debate whether the Award should include an express declaration that\u00a0the Claimants are to be indemnified in respect of taxes the Venezuelan Republic\u00a0or other States might apply to the awarded payments. The Tribunal will explain\u00a0the Parties' positions (1.) and make a decision (2.) to, then, move on to a specific\u00a0issue: the potential impact of Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT (3.).\n1. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS\n777. The Claimants argue that Abdala/Zadicoff's value assessments were made net of\u00a0Venezuelan taxes. Consequently, any tax Venezuela might claim on the\u00a0compensation would amount to double taxation.813 Therefore, to secure full\u00a0reparation, the Claimants have requested that the Tribunal declare that:\nThe Award is made net of Venezuelan taxes;814 and\nVenezuela may not claim taxes of any kind on the Award.815\n778. They are also seeking to have Venezuela indemnify them in respect of any tax\u00a0liability that might arise in Luxembourg, Portugal or any other jurisdiction. The\u00a0underlying rationale for this claim is that such liabilities would also be a result of\u00a0the wrong committed by Venezuela: had Venezuela not breached the BITs, no\u00a0compensation would have been paid, and there would thus be no taxable income\u00a0on that account.816\n779. Expert Hart, appointed by the Bolivarian Republic, notes that the Claimants have\u00a0failed to specify what the tax risk they claim to be facing is, and, therefore,\u00a0contends this claim is speculation and advocates for its dismissal.817\n780. Venezuela adds that the language of the BITs restricts the Tribunal's role to\u00a0determining whether or not there was a breach of the obligations therein\u00a0established and, as the case may be, setting the amount of compensation due;\u00a0however, the BITs do not vest the Tribunal with the additional power to issue a\u00a0purely declaratory opinion, let alone concerning an issue as important to\u00a0sovereignty as the matter of taxation powers.818\n781. As to the claim for indemnity from tax liabilities arising abroad, Venezuela finds\u00a0this constitutes an unjustified benefit. The Claimants have failed to explain what\u00a0these taxes are, how they would be damaging to them, or the causal link between\u00a0the taxes and the wrongful acts.819\n813\n814\n815\n816\n817\n818\n819\n  \nCV, para. 309.\nCV, para. 309.\nCV, para. 309.\nCV, para. 3 19(g).

The Claimants have asserted two very distinct requests:\nAs to the taxes that might apply in Venezuela (A.), they ask that the Arbitral Tribunal order Venezuela not to claim taxes on the Award or, in\u00a0the alternative, that it declare that the Award is rendered net of Venezuelan\u00a0taxes; and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the taxes that might apply in other jurisdictions (B.), they ask that the\nArbitral Tribunal order Venezuela to indemnify the Claimants with respect to any such taxes.\nA. The Claim for Venezuelan Taxes\n783. The Claimants' first request is that the Arbitral Tribunal order the Venezuelan\u00a0State to refrain from taxing any awarded compensation. This request must fail.\n784. The Claimants have not explained the legal basis upon which this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal would be able to rule as requested. Obviously enough, the BITs and the\u00a0Washington Convention offer no such basis, as these sources of law only authorize\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on whether Venezuela has breached its obligations\u00a0under the BITs and, if so, set the appropriate compensation to provide reparation\u00a0for the damage thus caused; however, they do not allow it to order a sovereign\u00a0State like the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to refrain from applying taxes as\u00a0it sees fit on any tax event.\n785. The issue raised by the Claimants' in their second request is an entirely different\u00a0matter: that the Arbitral Tribunal declare that the amount of the award is set net\u00a0of taxes.\n786. The starting point is as follows: the Claimants are a Luxembourg company and a\u00a0Portuguese company and, therefore, their domicile for tax purposes is outside of\u00a0Venezuela. The Claimants are looking for a guarantee that, whatever the amount\u00a0they are awarded, such amount will not be reduced by potential taxes applied in\u00a0Venezuela, but will remain equal to what is ordered in this Award.\n787. The BITs require this of the State:\n\"[.1 the payment of immediate, adequate and effective compensation\n\"The compensation . .1 shall be paid without undue delay and shall be freely transferrable.\" 821\n788. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the BITs support the Claimants'\u00a0request: in this case, adequate compensation amounts to USD 137,017,887822\u00a0plus interest accrued until effective payment. The USD 137,017,887 plus interest\u00a0are to be paid effectively and be freely transferrable. This means that such\n820 Portuguese BIT, Article IV(c), and Luxembourg BIT, Article 4(c).\n821 Portuguese BIT, Article V.1(c) (in virtually identical terms) and Luxembourg BIT, Article 4.2.\n822 USD 112,345,530 for Tavsa's expropriation, and USD 24,672,357 for Comsigua's expropriation.\n177\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 180 of 201\namounts are the ones that are really to become an asset of the Claimants, who are legal entities with no tax domicile in Venezuela.\n789. If compensation could be subjected to Venezuelan taxes and Venezuela tried to\u00a0apply an offset between the compensation and the tax, the compensation\u00a0effectively paid would be lower than set in this Award, and the Bolivarian\u00a0Republic would thereby be defaulting on its obligations under the BITs. The\u00a0succession of causal links is satisfied: the monetary reduction suffered by the\u00a0Claimants would be attributable to actions of Venezuela exclusively, as\u00a0Venezuela would be the beneficiary of the tax whose application is reducing the\u00a0compensation amount.\n790. Otherwise, reductio ad absurdum, Venezuela could tax any compensation due\u00a0under an international award at 99%, thus reducing effective payment to 1% of\u00a0the amount of the award. The Award would be thus left without any content.\n791. In sum, if Venezuela were to subject the compensation to a tax which, once paid,\u00a0would cause the Claimant's incoming money stream to be decreased, Venezuela\u00a0would then be under an obligation to raise the amount of compensation, such\u00a0that the net sum after tax payment (or an offset) would reach USD 137,017,887\u00a0plus accrued interest and costs.\n792. To conclude, the Arbitral Tribunal will allow the Claimants' claim: the\ncompensation ordered in the Award will be net of Venezuelan taxes.\nB. The Claim for Taxes in the Country of Residence\n793. The Claimants go one step further and ask that Venezuela indemnify them from\u00a0any tax liabilities that might accrue in Portugal and Luxembourg (the Claimants'\u00a0tax domiciles) or in any other jurisdiction as a result of being paid the awarded\u00a0compensation.\n794. On this point, the Arbitral Tribunal concurs with the Respondent: Venezuela\u00a0should not be made liable for taxes applied outside of its tenitory, as the causal\u00a0link is broken when Venezuela satisfies the award and pays compensation to the\u00a0Claimants. From then on, any taxation affecting the Claimants' assets will be\u00a0attributable to the taxing State, not Venezuela. Venezuela cannot take\u00a0responsibility for the sovereign decisions of another jurisdiction, which are\u00a0beyond its control.\n178\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 181 of 201\nAdditional Argument\n795. Lastly, the Claimants have argued that the DCF model that was used as basis to\u00a0calculate the compensation due already made provision for taxes. Consequently,\u00a0the Claimants suggest, the compensation had already been reduced to reflect the\u00a0tax impact and, if the Arbitral Tribunal were not to keep the Claimants\u00a0indemnified from a tax perspective, it would be allowing double taxation.\n796. This argument is a non sequitur:823 the DCF methodology is an approach to\u00a0assess the value of a company consisting in estimating the net cash flows the\u00a0company will be generating in the future. However, the tax on the income of the\u00a0target company is one thing, and the tax that will apply to a company's owner\u00a0upon the company's sale or expropriation is an entirely different matter:\u00a0corporate income tax and tax on the owner's profits upon a sale or expropriation\u00a0are radically different concepts.\n3. \u00a0\u00a0ARTICLE 5 OF THE LUXEMBOURG BIT\n797. Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT, entitled \"Transferencias\" IlTransfersi includes the\u00a0following provision:\n\"1. Each Contracting Party shall grant investors of the other Contracting Party the free transfer, to or from its territory, of all payments related to an\u00a0investment and, in particular: [.1\n(c) compensation paid under Article 4. [..J\n3. Each Contracting Party shall issue the necessary authorizations to ensure that such transfers are completed without undue delay and without charges other\u00a0than the usual taxes and expenses.\"\n798. The French version of Article 5.3 reads:\n\"Chacune des Parties contra ctantes, d\u00e9livrera les authorisations n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer sans d\u00e9lai injustifl\u00e9 1 'execution des transfers, et\u00a0Ce, sans d'autres charges que les taxes etfrais usuels.\"\n799. The Arbitral Tribunal asked the Parties824 to comment on the potential impact of\u00a0Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT on their positions on the subject of tax\u00a0indemnity.\nA. The Claimants' Position\n800. It is the Claimants' view that Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT does not relate to\u00a0taxes applied on the compensation due for expropriation, as it only refers to the\n823 ConocoPhillips, Exhibit CLA 78: in a very unpersuasive manner, this award argued that there was a link between the\u00a0taxes factored into the cash flows model and the debtor's obligation to cover the creditor's tax liabilities. An agreement\u00a0whereby seller and buyer set the price for the purchase of a company via a discounted cash flows calculation including the\u00a0tax effect (both positive and negative) the company will experience in the future does not mean that the buyer has to pay\u00a0the seller, in addition to the purchase price, the corporate tax that will apply to the seller for the profits earned upon the\u00a0sale of the company.\n82 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of August 5, 2016.\n179\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 182 of 201\nusual taxes and expenses that apply on the issue of the authorizations required in order to make transfer of the payment possible.825 The French version of the\u00a0BIT, which includes the words \"et Ce,\" more clearly denotes that the fiscal\u00a0assessment in question relates to the authorizations.826 Moreover, paragraph 1 of\u00a0that Article ensures the free transfer of compensation; if such compensation were\u00a0taxed, it would no longer be a free transfer. 827\n801. Moreover, the relevant legislation on the subject of taxation of the compensation\u00a0due for expropriation is the Nationalization Decree, No. 6058, itself, Article 10 of\u00a0which clearly enshrines the tax-exempt status of such compensation:828\n\"Any acts, transactions and agreements done or executed for the prnpose of the transformation to a State -Owned Company referred to in this Decree, as\u00a0well as any assignments, transfers of assets, and any other transaction that\u00a0entails an enrichment or the disposal, conveyance or sale of assets intended\u00a0to become assets of such companies shall be exempt from the payment of\u00a0any taxes, fees, special contributions or any other fiscal obligation.\"\n802. According to the Claimants, the above conclusion is reinforced by the fact that\u00a0the compensation paid to the Japanese Shareholders was free of taxes, pursuant\u00a0to said Article 10:829\n830\n\"Pursuant to the NationalizationJ Decree [.1 any transactions hereunder are free of any and all taxes and, therefore, any moneys to be paid by\u00a0[Venezuela] shall be so payable without deducting any amount whatsoever\u00a0on account of taxes. [..J In the event that any of the Sellers is required to\u00a0pay taxes to the Republic or to any division and organization of the State of\u00a0Venezuela, [Venezuela] shall indemnify the Seller for such payment and\u00a0any other payment.\"\nB. The Resnondent's Position\n803. The Respondent's reading of Article 5 of the Luxembourg BIT is different. In its\u00a0view, this Article allows the State to levy the usual taxes and fees on the\u00a0compensation due for expropriatory measures.831\n804. It further notes that the Claimants have no standing to rely on the Nationalization\u00a0Decree to seek tax indemnity as the Nationalization Decree only applies to\u00a0lawful expropriations and, in the case at hand, the Claimants contend they\u00a0suffered an unlawful expropriation. The applicable legal instrument is then the\u00a0Luxembourg BIT, which draws no distinction between lawful and unlawful\u00a0expropriations P832\n825 CVI, para. 11.\n826 CVII, para. 6.\n827 CVII, para. 8.\n828 CVI, para. 9.\n829 CVI, para. 10.\n830 Exhibit C-72.\n831 RVI, para. 6.\n832 RVI, para. 17.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 183 of 201\n805. As to whether the French version of the BIT sheds some light on its conect\u00a0interpretation, the Respondent doubts it. According to the Bolivarian Republic,\u00a0the expression \"et Ce\" may refer to both the authorizations and the transfers.833\n806. The Respondent also denies that its obligation under the BIT to allow \"free\u00a0transfer\" entails unrestricted freedom.834\nC. The Arbitral Tribunal's Decision\n807. Article 5.3 of the Luxembourg BIT allows the application of certain \"usual taxes\u00a0and expenses:\"\n\"Each Party to the Contract shall issue the necessary authorizations to ensure that the transfers will be made without undue delay and without\u00a0other charges other than habitual taxes and expenditures.\"\n808. The Parties' positions conflict as regards the correct interpretation of Article 5.3\u00a0of the Luxembourg BIT, and whether this provision might undermine the\u00a0conclusion on tax indemnity reached by the Arbitral Tribunal in the preceding\u00a0section:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the Claimants' view that the expression \"sin otros cargos que no sean\nlos impuestos y gas tos usuales\" refers to the fiscal assessments related to the issue of authorizations;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent contends these are assessments concerning the transfers.\n809. The Arbitral Tribunal finds the Claimants' position to be more persuasive, for the\u00a0following reasons.\n810. The Arbitral Tribunal will first determine what the conect text of Article 5.3 is\u00a0(a.) and will then interpret it in the light of the relevant criteria (b.)\na. \u00a0\u00a0The Correct Version of Article 5.3\n811. Tenaris has brought to the Arbitral Tribunal's attention the semantic\u00a0discrepancies between the French and Spanish versions of the BIT. Conectly\u00a0translated from its French version, Article 5.3 reads as follows:835\n\"Each Contracting Party shall issue the necessaiy aiithonzations to ensure that such transfers are completed without undue delay, and this without any\u00a0charges other than the usual fees and expenses.\"\n812. There are thus significant differences between the conect translation from\n833 RVII, para. 4.\n834 RVII, para. 5.\n835 Free translation of the original by the Arbitral Tribunal: \"Chacune des Parties contractantes, d\u00e9livrera les autorisations n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer sans d\u00e9lai injustifl\u00e9 / 'execution des transfers, et Ce, sans d 'autres charges que les\u00a0taxes etfrais usuels.\" Bold and underlined emphasis is the Arbitral Tribunal's.\n181\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 184 of 201\nFrench into Spanish and the Spanish version of the BIT:\nThe first one is a clear translation enor: the Spanish version leaves out two words (\"et ce\") which do appear in the French version;\nThe second one is terminological in nature: the conect translation of the French word \"taxes\" is the specific concept of \"tasas\" Ilfeesi, not the\u00a0generic \"impuestos\" taxesI, as both \"taxes\" and \"tasas\" refer to charges\u00a0applied by a State for the provision of a public service. 836\n813. Which version should prevail?\n814. The BIT itself provides the answer: pursuant to its final provision, even though\u00a0the Spanish, French and Dutch versions are equally authentic, in the event of\u00a0discrepancies consideration is to be had to the fact that the negotiations took\u00a0place in French. Therefore, since there are indeed discrepancies between the\u00a0Spanish and French versions of Article 5.3, the Arbitral Tribunal will take into\u00a0consideration the fact that the contracting States negotiated these provisions in\u00a0French and it is based on this version that they projected their consent.\n815. Article 5.3 is not an isolated instance of inconsistencies between the French and\u00a0the Spanish versions:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1.1(b) substitutes \"and\" with \"or\";837\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are words left out of Articles 5.1(b) and 1O.3;838\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 9.2 changes tenses from present to future;839\n- Article 10.1 adds words.84\u00b0\n816. Without question, the Contracting Parties were aware of the potential differences\u00a0between the French -negotiated original and the two versions translated into\u00a0Spanish and Dutch, and it is for this reason that they included a closing provision\u00a0giving prevalence to the original language in which the negotiations were carried\n836 'Taxe' is defined in the Larousse dictionaiy as \"a fiscal assessment intended to increase the treasuiy of the State, a local collective or a public administrative entity as consideration for a service provided to private parties.\" Likewise,\u00a0'tasa' is defined in the Diccionario de Ia Real Academia de Ia Len gua dictionary as follows: \"A charge applied on the\u00a0en)oyment of certain services or the performance of certain activities.\n83 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ainsi que toute personne moral effectivement contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par un investisseur compris dans Ic paragraphe 1, a) et\nb)\" \"f..], asI como toda persona jurIdica controlada efectivamente por un inversor comprendido en elparrafo la) o b)\nI I.\"\nS38 \"des sommes destin\u00e9es au reglement d 'obligations contra ctuelles, y compris les sommes n\u00e9cessaires au remboursement d 'emprunts, les redevances et autres paiements d\u00e9coulant de licences, franchises, concessions et autres\u00a0droits similaires, \" \"las sumas destinadas al pago de obligaciones contractuales inclusive las sumas necesarias para\u00a0el pago de pr\u00e9stamos, de re'alIas, de todos los pagos referentes a licencias, franquicias, concesiones y otros derechos\u00a0similares.\"\n\"Si Ic Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de Ia Cour est ressortissant de 1 'une ou 1 'autre Partie contractante ....\"\"Si el Vicepresidente de la\nCorte Internacional de cualquiera de las Partes Contratantes.\"\n839 . .]Ie deff\u00e9rend est soumis 1...]\"; \"A cette fin, chacune des Parties contractantes donne son consentement f..].\"\u00a0\"f..] la controversia se someter\u00e1 1...]\"; \"A este fin cada una de las Partes Contratantes otor'ar\u00e1 su\u00a0consentimientof...].\"\n840 \"Tout dff'rend relatif a 1 'interpretation f..].\" \"Cualquier controversia entre las Partes Contratantes relativa a Ia\u00a0interpretaci\u00f3n f..].\"\n182\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 185 of 201\nout.\nb. Interpretation of Article 5.3\n817. Having established what the relevant language of Article 5.3 is, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal must now interpret whether the levy thereby authorized affects the\u00a0issue of authorizations or the transfer of the compensation payment.\n818. The rules of interpretation of any treaty are enshrined in Article 31 of the VCLT:\u00a0ordinary meaning, (i.), context, and object and purpose (ii.)\n(i) Ordinary Meaning\n819. Article 5.3 allows the application of fees (and other expenses). The goal here is\u00a0to determine whether, from the standpoint of the provision's ordinary meaning,\u00a0the conect reading is that such fees apply to the issue of authorizations (as\u00a0advocated for by the Claimants) or what they actually apply to is capital transfers\u00a0(according to the Respondent).\n820. The Tribunal leans toward the interpretation proposed by the Claimants: each\u00a0Contracting Party is to issue the necessary authorizations to ensure that transfers\u00a0take place without undue delay and without any other charges other than the\u00a0usual taxes and expenses.\n821. In its French version, Article 5.3 reads as follows:\n\"Chacune des Parties contra ctantes, d\u00e9livrera les authorisations n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer sans d\u00e9lai injustifl\u00e9 1 'execution des transfers, et\u00a0Ce, sans d'autres charges que les taxes etfrais usuels.\"\n822. By means of Article 5.3, each Contracting Party assumes an obligation: it will\u00a0issue the authorizations required to ensure that transfers are made without undue\u00a0delay. Then the BIT includes the expression \"y esto, sin otros cargos f..]\" (\"et\u00a0Ce, sans d'autres charges\"). A textual reading of those words supports the\u00a0Claimants' interpretation: \"Esto\" (\"ce\") this] can only refer to the obligation\u00a0undertaken by the State in Article 5.3, i.e. the issue of the authorization, not the\u00a0transfers themselves.\n823. This textual interpretation is reinforced by the use of the notion of \"tasas\"\u00a0(\"taxes\") feesI. There are different kinds of fiscal burdens, and fees are one of\u00a0them.841 A fee is a levy paid by a party as consideration for a service provided by\u00a0the Administration. This is the usual meaning of the term 'tasa. 'There is only one\u00a0taxable event the tasas mentioned in Article 5.3 can apply to: the issue, by the\u00a0Authorities, of the administrative authorizations required to allow the transfer of\u00a0an investment or the returns on an investment abroad. The issue of an\u00a0authorization is indeed a public service, whereas the existence of a transfer\u00a0cannot be the subject of a fee, as a transfer is not in itself a service provided by\u00a0the Administration.\n841 Venezuelan Law distinguishes between fees and other fiscal burdens, such as taxes. Cf Articles 31 and 136 of the 1961\u00a0Venezuelan Constitution and Article 13 of the 1994 Venezuelan Organic Tax Code, as they were in force when the BITs\u00a0were negotiated.\n183\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 186 of 201\n(ii) Context, Object and Purpose\n824. The object and purpose of the BIT is to attract investments by creating favorable economic conditions.842\n825. Such favorable economic conditions include the States' obligations to pay\u00a0adequate and effective compensation in the event of expropriation (Article 4.1(d)\u00a0and to allow the free transfer of such compensation (Articles 4.2 and 5.1(e)) - all\u00a0in accordance with Article 5.3.\n826. Between a scenario where the State is allowed to levy fiscal amounts on the\u00a0transfer of compensation and another where the State is only allowed to levy\u00a0assessments on the issue of the authorization required to make the transfer, the\u00a0Tribunal will choose the latter scenario, as it is the one that best fits the purpose\u00a0of the BIT and its context.\nc. Additional Argument\n827. The Claimants have pointed out that Article 10 of the Nationalization Decree\u00a0provided that the compensation for expropriation would be exempt of the\u00a0payment of taxes, fees, special contributions or any other fiscal obligation.843\u00a0And the compensation to the Japanese Shareholders844 expressly acknowledged\u00a0the fact that, pursuant to the Nationalization Decree, such transaction was free of\u00a0any and all taxes; therefore, were Venezuela to apply an assessment on the\u00a0compensation, the Bolivarian Republic should gross the amount due up to a net\u00a0amount which, after deducting such taxes, would be equal to the agreed upon\u00a0compensation.845 This would reinforce the conclusion that the conect\u00a0interpretation of Article 5.3 of the Luxembourg BIT prevents the application of\u00a0taxes on the compensation.\n828. The Respondent refuses to recognize any relevance to the tax -related provisions\u00a0of the Nationalization Decree, as they only apply to voluntary settlements\u00a0between the State and an investor, as was the case with the compensation paid to\u00a0the Japanese Shareholders.846\n829. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent: the tax indemnity that is\u00a0expressly recognized in the Nationalization Decree and was granted to the\u00a0Japanese Shareholders is relevant, because it evidences State behavior that is\u00a0consistent with the manner in which the Arbitral Tribunal has interpreted Article\u00a05.3 of the BIT in this Award.\n842 First desiring clause.\n843 Article 10: \"Any acts, transactions and agreements done or executed for the purpose of the transformation to a State -Owned Company referred to in this Decree, as well as any assignments, transfers of assets, and any other transaction that\u00a0entails an enrichment or the disposal, conveyance or sale of assets intended to become assets of such companies shall be\u00a0exempt from the payment of any taxes, fees, special contributions or any other fiscal obligation.\"\n844 C-72.\n845 Clause 10.1.\n846 RVII, para. 19.\n184\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 187 of 201\nX. COSTS\n830. Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) provides that\n\"the award shall be in writing and shall contain [.1 any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n831. The Tribunal requested that the Parties submit a breakdown of the sums they are\u00a0seeking as costs.847 The following sections recount the Parties' claims regarding\u00a0the costs of the proceedings in connection with the Centre and the arbitrators'\u00a0fees ['Costs of the Proceeding\"I and the fees and expenses of their attorneys,\u00a0witnesses, experts and other representatives ['Defense Expenses\"I. The\u00a0Tribunal notes that neither Party has challenged the cost items claimed by the\u00a0opposing Party or the accuracy of the amounts sought.\n1. THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION\n832. The Claimants are seeking the following amounts:\nCosts of the Proceeding: USD 1 ,050,000;848\nDefense Expenses: USD 5,721,236,849 EUR 256,892, COP 487,000, ARP 58,882 and MXN 76,852.\n833. The sum of the above figures totals USD 6,771,236, EUR 256,892, COP 487,000,\u00a0ARP 58,882 and MXN 76,852.\n834. The Claimants have requested that the Tribunal order Venezuela to pay all of the\u00a0above sums.\n2. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION\n835. The Respondent, who has not contributed to the Costs of the Proceeding, is only\u00a0seeking Defense Expenses in the sum of USD 7,974,674.850\n836. The Respondent trusts that the Tribunal will find that it lacks jurisdiction and\u00a0argues that, in any event, Venezuela has not failed to fulfill its obligations under\u00a0the BITs.851 It therefore requests that the Claimants be ordered to pay all of the\u00a0costs of this arbitration.852\n3. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL'S DECISION\n837. Article 6 1(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n847 T., p. 1716: 1-21.\n848 CVI, p. 6; Letter from the Claimants, October 7, 2016.\n849 CVI, pp.6-8.\n850 RVI, p. 6.\n851 RIV, para. 458.\n852 RIV, para. 458.\n185\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 188 of 201\n\"the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and\u00a0shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the\u00a0members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the\u00a0Centre shall be paid.\"\nA. Cost Awarding Criteria\n838. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules offer any sort of\u00a0guidance for the allocation of costs and, therefore, the Tribunal has discretion to\u00a0rule on their allocation.\n839. The Claimants have asked that the Arbitral Tribunal apply the costs -follow-the-event standard,853 while the Respondent suggests the procedural recklessness\u00a0standard, which, in its opinion, applies to the Claimants, who therefore should be\u00a0made to bear the costs of this arbitration.854 The Arbitral Tribunal will analyze\u00a0each standard separately, starting with the recklessness standard.\nThe Claimants' Alleged Recklessness\n840. The Respondent maintains that, throughout the arbitration, the Claimants\u00a0engaged in bad faith behavior that caused delays and unnecessary complications,\u00a0and mentions the following as examples:855\nObjecting to the bifurcation of the proceedings.\nFiling 16 exhibits with its counter -memorial, which should have been filed earlier, instead of one month before the Hearing on jurisdiction; the work\u00a0required to analyze this new evidence made it necessary to cancel the\u00a0Hearing.\nMaking incomplete submissions of the evidence requested by the\nRespondent's expert.\nRefusing to examine the Respondent's expert after his presentation, so that they would have all night to better prepare for his examination the next\u00a0day.\nRequesting the incorporation of new documents a few days prior to the Evidentiary Hearing, thus forcing the Republic to use up time that had\u00a0been set aside to prepare for the Hearing to respond to this untimely\u00a0evidence.\n841. According to repeated decisions, in order for a tribunal to be able to rule that a\u00a0party committed procedural recklessness, it is necessary that the opposing party\u00a0establish:\n853\n854\n855\n  \nCV, para. 314.\nRV, para. 276.\nRV, para. 276.\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 189 of 201\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frivolous, inational, or unlawful behavior,856 or\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obstructionist behavior that causes an unnecessary extension of the\nproceedings.857\n842. None of the Claimant's behaviors pointed out by the Bolivarian Republic\u00a0wanants being labeled as reckless.\nThe Costs -Follow -The -Event Criterion\n843. The Claimants have asked the Tribunal to apply the costs -follow -the -event\u00a0criterion, ordering the losing party to pay the expenses incuned by the prevailing\u00a0party. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees on applying this principle, as it is commonly\u00a0used in arbitration practice.858\n844. In this case, the Claimants are the prevailing parties as they have had the\u00a0jurisdictional objections rejected and their main expropriation claim accepted by\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal. However, the Respondent has also prevailed to a certain\u00a0extent, as it has managed to persuade the Arbitral Tribunal that the amount of\u00a0compensation due was lower than sought.\nB. Annlication of the Costs -Follow -The -Event Rule\n845. The Arbitral Tribunal will apply the rule that costs follow the event to the two\u00a0major cost categories: on the one hand, the Costs of the Proceeding and, on the\u00a0other Defense Expenses.\na. Costs of the Proceeding\n846. The first expense category the Claimants seek to be reimbursed for is USD\u00a01,050,000 as Costs of the Proceeding, for the advances paid to ICSID. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal finds that these Costs of the Proceeding are to be borne by the\u00a0Respondent in full, for the following reasons:\nPursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations of the Centre, the Costs of the Proceeding are to be borne by\u00a0the parties by half; however, in this case, the Respondent chose not to pay\u00a0its half, such that the Claimants were forced to cover Venezuela's portion.\n- The Arbitral Tribunal has rejected the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and granted the Claimants' main petitum.\n847. In the absence of an allegation or evidence, it is the Arbitral Tribunal's\u00a0understanding that the Claimants covered the Costs of the Proceeding in equal\u00a0portions and, therefore, Venezuela is to reimburse:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenaris: for USD 525,000; and\n856 Omer Dede, para 6; MCI Power, para. 372; AES, para. 15.3.3; EDF, para. 322.\n857 Liberian Eastern Timber; OlguIn.\n858 EDF, para. 327; Plama, para. 316, Phoenix, para. 151, 01 European, para. 964.\n187\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 190 of 201\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talta: for USD 525,000.\nb. Defense Expenses\n848. The Claimants seek close to USD 6 million859 in Defense Expenses, which cover\u00a0various different costs. It is the Arbitral Tribunal's view that, of such Defense\u00a0Expenses, the Claimants can only seek from the Respondent those which are\u00a0essential to reasonably defend their claim ['Reasonable Defense Expenses\"I.\n849. Considering the complexity of the case at hand, the quantum of the claims and\u00a0the work performed by counsel and experts, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that\u00a0Reasonable Defense Expenses total USD 2.8 million.\n850. Of such USD 2.8 million, Venezuela will bear the portion anived at by applying\u00a0the rule that costs follow the event. In order to assess the sum due, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal will proceed as follows:\n- First, it will determine what the major issues to be ruled upon have been;\nSecond, because the Claimants have failed to break down their legal Defense Expenses, the Arbitral Tribunal will attribute a weight to each\u00a0issue; moreover, it will determine the proportion in which these are to be\u00a0allocated among the two Claimants, who made their costs request jointly,\u00a0without specifying the allocation percentage;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, it will determine a success percentage for the Claimants' claims\nconcerning each matter, and will apply that percentage to the relevant Reasonable Defense Expenses.\n851. In this arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal has had to make three major decisions:\u00a0whether it had jurisdiction, whether Venezuela had engaged in wrongful conduct\u00a0that engaged its responsibility, and the compensation due to the Claimants by\u00a0Venezuela on account of such wrongful conduct.\n852. Weighing the complexity of each such issue and the attention given it by the\u00a0attorneys and itself, the Arbitral Tribunal has concluded that:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdictional issues have a weight of 20%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsibility issues have a weight of 30%; and\n859\n  \nAs well as much lower additional amounts in other currencies.\n188\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 191 of 201\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantum issues have a weight of 50%.\n853. Accordingly, Reasonable Defense Expenses are divided as follows:\nJurisdiction: 20% of USD 2,800,000, i.e. USD 560,000; because the jurisdictional objections were asserted as against both Claimants, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal finds that the cost is to be allocated to Tenaris and Talta\u00a0in equal portions.\nResponsibility: 30% of USD 2,800,000, i.e. USD 840,000; again, because the Respondent denied having unlawfully expropriated the two companies,\u00a0the Tribunal rules that this cost is to be allocated to Tenaris and Talta on a\u00a050% basis.\nDamages quantum: 50% of USD 2,800,000, i.e. USD 1,400,000. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Reasonable Defense Expenses covering the\u00a0assessment of the compensation amount due for the expropriation of Tavsa\u00a0and Comsigua are to be allocated, based on complexity considerations, 75%\u00a0to Tavsa and 25% to Comsigua, i.e. USD 1,050,000 to Tavsa (Tenaris) and\u00a0USD 350,000 to Comsigua (Talta).\n854. The next step is to determine the degree to which the Claimants have succeeded as\u00a0regards each such issue:\n- Jurisdiction: because the Arbitral Tribunal has rejected all jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent, the Claimant's success percentage\u00a0here is 100%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merits: the Claimants' main cause of action was the expropriation by\nVenezuela, and the Arbitral Tribunal has agreed with them and, therefore, their success percentage is, yet again, 100%;\nQuantum: the Claimants were seeking USD 213.2 million for Tavsa's expropriation, and USD 30.5 million for Comsigua's expropriation; here,\u00a0the Tribunal has respectively granted the sums of USD 112.3 million and\u00a0USD 24.67 million. In other words, Tenaris' claim concerning Tavsa has\u00a0been 53% successful, and Talta's claim in connection with Comsigua has\u00a0been 81% successful.\n855. The Arbitral Tribunal will apply the above success percentages to the\u00a0Reasonable Defense Expenses for each legal issue:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction: 100% of USD 560,000, i.e. USD 560,000, due to Tenaris and\nTalta in equal portions (USD 280,000);\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsibility: 100% of USD 840,000, i.e. USD 840,000, due to Tenaris\nand Talta in equal portions (USD 420,000), and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantum: 53% of USD 1.05 million for Tavsa, and 81% of USD 350,000\nfor Comsigua, i.e. USD 556,500 for Tavsa (Tenaris) and USD 283,500 for\n189\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 192 of 201\nComsigua (Talta).\n856. To conclude, the above means that Venezuela will be required to reimburse to:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenaris: USD 1,256.500 on account of Reasonable Defense Expenses,\ndetermined based on the success of its claims for Talta's expropriation;\n- Talta: USD 983,500 on account of Reasonable Defense Expenses, determined based on the success of its claims for Comsigua's\u00a0expropriation.\n190\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 193 of 201\nXI. SUMMARY\n857. In this Award, the Tribunal addresses three major issues:\n- Whether it has jurisdiction (1.)\n- Whether the Bolivarian Republic expropriated Tenaris' and Talta's investment in Venezuela, in violation of Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT\u00a0and Article IV of the Portuguese BIT (2.)\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What the sum due on account of compensation for that expropriation is (3.).\n858. The Arbitral Tribunal also rules on lesser issues (4.), like the interest, Claimants'\u00a0tax indemnity, and costs claims.\n1. JURISDICTION\n859. Venezuela raised three jurisdictional objections, all of which have failed.\nA. Lack of Consent\n860. In investment arbitration proceedings arising from a BIT, consent to arbitration\u00a0is perfected successively: the State's offer is formalized first, and it is then\u00a0accepted by the investor.\n861. Venezuela contends that the Claimants did not timely accept the Republic's\u00a0arbitration offer.\n862. The timing of acceptance is relevant, as the Bolivarian Republic has denounced\u00a0the Convention.860\n863. (i) The Respondent raised two objections to Tenaris' consent to submit disputes\u00a0arising in connection with Tavsa to arbitration, which the Tribunal has\u00a0dismissed:\n- Following the Tavsa Notice and before Venezuela submitted its Denunciation, Tenaris tried for more than six months to settle the Tavsa-related dispute;861\nThe terms of Venezuela's arbitration offer were perfectly consistent with those of Tenaris' acceptance;862 even if the inclusion of a reservation of\u00a0rights by Tenaris were viewed as having entailed an alteration to the terms\u00a0of the offer, it would not be a material change863 and, in any event, it would\u00a0be inelevant, as Tenaris never actually enforced that reservation.864\n860 See para. 62 supra.\n861 See para. 81 supra.\n862 See para. 86 supra.\n863 See para. 90 supra.\nSee para. 89 supra.\n191\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 194 of 201\n864. (ii) The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Talta had validly accepted Venezuela's\u00a0offer to submit any disputes related to Comsigua to arbitration: the six-month\u00a0negotiation period started, as per the Portuguese BIT, with the first negotiation\u00a0consultation - June 28, 2010865 - and thus expired before Talta sent the\u00a0Comsigua Notice on December 2, 2011, accepting Venezuela's arbitration offer;\u00a0this Notice also predates the Denunciation. 866\n865. (iii) The case of Tenaris as an indirect investor in Comsigua is more complicated\u00a0as, pursuant to the Luxembourg BIT, the six-month negotiation period starts as\u00a0from the Comsigua Notice (December 2, 2011), such that, by the time it expired,\u00a0Venezuela had already denounced the Convention.\n866. Venezuela argues as follows:\nTenaris' acceptance of the offer to arbitrate, stated in the Comsigua Notice, does not perfect consent to arbitration as the six months of prior\u00a0negotiations- a jurisdictional requirement, not a procedural one - had not\u00a0yet expired;867\n- The acceptance stated in the Request of Arbitration does not perfect consent either because, even though it was filed after the mandatory\u00a0negotiation period, this took place after the Denunciation.868\n867. Tenaris disagrees: the prior negotiations requirement is said to be procedural in\u00a0nature and would only determine the time at which the request for arbitration can\u00a0actually be filed, but would not affect consent to arbitration, which could be\u00a0stated (and perfected) prior to the expiration of the negotiation period. 869\n868. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Luxembourg BIT allowed Tenaris to choose\u00a0a forum for dispute resolution and thus accept the State's arbitration offer as\u00a0early as the Comsigua Notice.87\u00b0\n865 See para. 95 supra.\n866 See para. 96 supra.\n867 See para. 112 supra.\n868 See para. 114 supra.\n869 See para. 119 supra.\n870 See para. 122 supra.\n192\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 195 of 201\nB. Lack of an Effective Seat\n869. The second jurisdictional objection focuses on the lack of an Effective Seat in\u00a0Luxembourg and Portugal. According to Venezuela, the BITs require that the\u00a0investors have their Effective Seat (not just a Statutory Seat) in Luxembourg and\u00a0Portugal;871 neither Tenaris nor Talta satisfy this requirement,872 as their\u00a0Effective Seat is said to be in Argentina. 873\n870. On the other hand, the Claimants contend that their Effective Seats are the same\u00a0as their Statutory Seats and, in any event, are located in Luxembourg and\u00a0Portugal.874\n871. In theory, the Tribunal agrees with the Bolivarian Republic: the BITs do require\u00a0that the Effective Seat (not just the Statutory Seat) of the companies be located\u00a0in Luxembourg or Portugal.875\n872. Having defined what the relevant factors to determine the Effective Seat are876\u00a0and having assessed the evidence produced by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0finds that it has not been established that Tenaris' and Talta's Effective Seats are\u00a0located in Argentina; instead, the evidence points to their Effective Seats being\u00a0respectively located in Luxembourg and Portugal and, therefore, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal has rejected the Bolivarian Republic's objection to its ratione personae\u00a0jurisdiction.877\nC. Notification Defects\n873. The third and final objection to jurisdiction focuses on certain flaws in the Tavsa\u00a0Notice: allegedly, it did not make reference to a dispute concerning unfair and\u00a0inequitable treatment, and Tenaris is now asserting such a claim.878 Because\u00a0Tenaris' claim for unfair and inequitable treatment is framed as a subsidiary\u00a0petition relative to its main claim, which is an expropriation claim, and the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal will allow its main claim, there is no need to analyze this final\u00a0objection to jurisdiction.879\n2. EXPROPRIATION\n874. The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that, in canying out the orders in its Nationalization Decree and Implementing Decree, Venezuela forcefully acquired\u00a0the assets of Tavsa and Comsigua and took over their business activity. Such\u00a0forced acquisition materialized:\n871 See para. 152 supra.\n872 See para. 153 supra.\n873 See para. 153 supra.\nSee para. 153 supra.\nSee para. 189 supra.\n876 See para. 230 supra.\n877 See para. 230 supra.\n878 See para. 232 supra.\n879 See para. 234 supra.\n193\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 196 of 201\nFor Tavsa, through the transfer record of November 16, 2009;880\nFor Comsigua, on June 17, 2011, through the administrative appointment of the company's new President and the power handover that was\u00a0formalized at the Takeover Meeting.881\n875. Because both Tenaris and Talta still hold title to their shares in Tavsa and\u00a0Comsigua, the Arbitral Tribunal has defined this expropriation as an indirect\u00a0expropriation: both investors keep title to their shares in shell companies whose\u00a0assets and business activity are under the control of the State of Venezuela. 882\n876. The Arbitral Tribunal has verified that Venezuela has not yet paid any\u00a0compensation at all to the investors, in spite of the fact that more than seven\u00a0years have elapsed since the issue of the Nationalization Decree and the\u00a0Implementing Decree. This delay does not constitute \"immediate payment\" as\u00a0required by Article 4 of the Luxembourg BIT and Article IV of the Portuguese\u00a0BIT.883\n877. Venezuela tries to justify the delay, but the Tribunal does not agree on its\u00a0argument: no judgment has been rendered ordering payment of the fair price\u00a0because the State, who is the party required to institute the judicial expropriation\u00a0proceedings in its capacity as the expropriating entity, has not done so;884 the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal also fails to see any obstructing behavior on the part of the\u00a0Claimants that could be the reason for a delay in the payment of compensation.885\n3. COMPENSATION DUE\n878. The BITs require that the amount of compensation for expropriation be equal to\u00a0the fair value of the investments on the date before that on which the measure\u00a0was taken.886\n879. Therefore, prior to determining the value of Tenaris' and Talta's investment in\u00a0Tavsa and Comsigua, the Arbitral Tribunal had to determine what the valuation\u00a0date would be. It is the Arbitral Tribunal's view that the expropriations took\u00a0place by virtue of the Nationalization Decree, as supplemented by the\u00a0Implementing Decree.887 Therefore, the date of the expropriatory measure is\u00a0April 30, 2008, and the day before that is April 29, 2008.888 To allow for easier\u00a0calculations, the experts have used April 30, 2008 as the reference date, and the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal accepts this simplification. 889\n880 See para. 271 supra.\n881 See para. 273 supra.\n882 See para. 337 supra.\n883 See para. 357 supra.\n884 See para. 358 supra.\n885 See paras. 372, 377 supra.\n886 See para. 393 supra.\n887 See paras. 405, 411 supra.\n888 See para. 409 supra.\n889 See para. 410 supra.\n194\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 197 of 201\nA. Tavsa's Value Assessment\n880. The decision on Tavsa's value assessment has been made as follows:\n881. (i) The Arbitral Tribunal first applies a DCF methodology to value Tavsa.89\u00b0 The\u00a0discount rate used in this exercise is the company's WACC, set at 21.7%.891 The\u00a0value thus arrived at for Tenaris' 70% stake in Tavsa is USD 112,345,530.892\n882. (ii) Second, the Tribunal has compared that value by applying other methodologies: the return on investment approach, which results in a rate similar\u00a0to the return on equity used in the WACC calculation;893 the market multiples\u00a0approach, as per which Tavsa's value is within the range set by the reference\u00a0companies;894 and, lastly, the comparable transactions approach, which also\u00a0confirms the assessed value.895\nB. Comsiva's Value Assessment\n883. The Tribunal has assessed Comsigua's value also by applying a DCF methodology. The Tribunal has applied a WACC of 20.47%,896 and estimated\u00a0that Talta's 7.58% share in Comsigua is worth USD 22.3 million.897\n884. Next, the Arbitral Tribunal compares this value by applying other methodologies: the market multiples approach yields a higher value,898 as does\u00a0the comparable transactions approach;899 the Tribunal also considers the offer\u00a0Venezuela had made to Talta;90\u00b0 and finds that the DCF value is low as\u00a0compared to the values from the other approaches; to anive at the conect value,\u00a0it weighs the various assessments901 and sets a value of USD 24,672,357.\n885. Lastly, given that there is no specific request by the Claimants, the Arbitral Tribunal rules that the compensation due for expropriation should be paid to the\u00a0direct investor in each expropriated company: Tenaris is to be paid\u00a0compensation for Tavsa, and Talta is to be paid compensation for Comsigua.902\nSee para. 518 supra.\nSee para. 601 supra.\nSee para. 603 supra.\nSee para. 612 supra.\nSee para. 623 supra.\nSee para. 703 supra.\nSee para. 704 supra.\nSee para. 704 supra.\nSee para. 706 supra.\nSee para. 714 supra.\nSee paras. 725 et seq. supra.\nSee para. 755 supra.\nSee para. 775 supra.\n195\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 198 of 201\n4. OTHER DECISIONS\n886. The Arbitral Tribunal has made three additional decisions.\n887. (i) The first one concerns interest. The Tribunal has been called upon to determine, in accordance with the BITs, the \"normal commercial\" rate\u00a0\"applicable in Venezuela.\"903 The Tribunal's ruling is that the rate that best fits\u00a0this description is LIBOR for one-year USD deposits plus 4% p.a.904 Accrued\u00a0interest is to be compounded every year in anears. The accrual period started on\u00a0April 30, 2008 and will end upon actual payment.\n888. (ii) The second one concerns taxation. The Claimants requested that the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal order Venezuela not to claim taxes on the award and, subsidiarily, that\u00a0the Award be rendered net of Venezuelan taxes; they also asked that Venezuela\u00a0indemnify the Claimants for any tax levied on the sums of the Award outside of\u00a0Venezuela.905\n889. The Arbitral Tribunal rejects all such requests,906 except for the subsidiary one:\u00a0the monetary award will be net of Venezuelan taxes, such that, should Venezuela\u00a0levy taxes on the amount of the Award, it will gross up the compensation paid in\u00a0order that the amount paid to the Claimants, net of Venezuelan taxes, is the\u00a0amount set forth in the Award.907\n890. (iii) Lastly, the Arbitral Tribunal applies the rule that costs follow the event908 to\u00a0the two major expense categories comprising the costs:\nCosts of the Proceeding: the Arbitral Tribunal rules that Venezuela will fully bear these Costs;909 therefore, Venezuela will reimburse each\u00a0Claimant for USD 525,000.910\nReasonable Defense Expenses: the Arbitral Tribunal takes consideration of the complexity of each issue debated here and the Claimants' degree of\u00a0success;911 it finds that Venezuela is to reimburse Tenaris for USD\u00a01,256,500 and Talta for USD 983,500912 on this account.\n903 See para. 757 supra.\nSee para. 771 supra. 905 See para. 777 supra.\u00a0906 See para. 842 supra.\u00a0907 See para. 843 supra.\u00a0908 See para. 845 supra.\u00a0909 See para. 846 supra.\u00a0910 See para. 847 supra.\u00a0911 See para. 849 supra.\u00a0912 See para. 856 supra.\n196\nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 199 of 201\n891. The Claimants have made other subsidiary requests in the event that the Tribunal\u00a0chose not to use April 30, 2008 as the valuation date or that the compensation\u00a0awarded for Comsigua fell short of a certain threshold amount. Because the\u00a0Tribunal has accepted that date and awarded compensation above the threshold\u00a0amount, these subsidiary claims do not apply.913\n913\n  \ncv, paras. 320, 321.\n  \n197\n  \nCase 1:18-cv-01373-PLF Document 1-3 Filed 06/08/18 Page 200 of 201\nXII.
