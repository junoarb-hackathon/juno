Accordingly, having considered the Application, I issue these Directions as President of the Tribunals pursuant to paragraph 5.3 of the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session (\"**Minutes**\").1 In accordance with that provision, I will confer with my colleagues as soon as possible regarding the final determination of the Application, including the need, if any, for reconsideration of these Directions.\n\nParagraph 5.3 of the Minutes provides that: \"[\u2026] where the matter is urgent, the President may take the decision without consulting the other Members, subject to the possibility of reconsideration of the decision by the full Tribunal.\"\n\n*Nature of the Application*\n---------------------------\n\n3.\n\nPart 1 of the Application states as follows:2\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION**\n\n1.1 This is an urgent application by the Claimants requesting the Tribunal to order the Respondent to desist in pursuing a course of action that breaches the disclosure regime that was ordered by the Tribunal at the Joint First Session (see paragraph 14 of the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session **(\"the Minutes\")**). The Claimants request that an order be made before Thursday of this week.\n\n1.2 The application arises out of a letter from the Respondent's Attorney-General (Mr Tomana), dated 11 June 2012 **(\"the Letter\") (tab 1)**, which was delivered today to one of Border Timbers Ltd's parent companies by a government lawyer and - peculiarly -two policemen.\n\n1.3 In the Letter, the Attorney-General insists on the disclosure of documents from the Claimants, for use in these Arbitrations, pursuant to a regime that breaches paragraph 14 of the Minutes and the ICSID Convention. The tone of the Letter is menacing and threatens criminal proceedings if the Claimants do not follow the disclosure regime proposed by the Respondent by Thursday, 14 June 2012, i.e. the day after tomorrow.\n\n1.4 In the circumstances, the Claimants request that the Tribunal (as a matter of urgency) order that the Respondent comply with paragraph 14 of the Minutes and not invoke its domestic law for procedural advantage in these proceedings **(see the full terms of the requested order in para 5 below)**. Given the urgency of the matter, the Tribunal may consider it appropriate to issue an interim order to preserve the status quo, pending further observations of the parties.\n\n1.5 The Claimants are concerned that if such an order is not made, and if the Respondent's agents (including the police) attend the Claimants' offices on Thursday of this week or at any other time, then the Claimants and their staff are likely to be subjected to intimidation and violence. The Claimants are particularly concerned given the Respondent's recent history of intimidating parties to international proceedings in which it is a respondent **(see tab 5, BBC article re the Campbell SADC case)**.\n\nThe Application refers to paragraph 14 of the Minutes which provides *inter alia* that \"[\u2026] 14.1 Either Party may request the Tribunal to call for the production of documents in accordance with Arbitration Rule 34(2). Before applying to the Tribunal for an order calling for the production of documents, however, the Parties shall make reasonable efforts to reach agreement as to the scope and timing of production. 14.2 To avoid the Parties propounding multiple requests for production of documents during the course of the arbitration, each Party will be permitted a primary request during the time allocated for the preparation of each of its two principal written submissions, and such follow up requests as may be reasonably warranted in the circumstances.\"\n\n4.\n\nParagraphs 3.2 and 3.3 provide as follows:\n\n3.2 The Letter is the first communication that the Claimants have had with the Respondent regarding the disclosure of documents by the Claimants in these proceedings. In breach of Arbitration Rule 18 and paragraph 7 of the Minutes, the Letter was sent directly to the Claimants and not to their counsel, Steptoe & Johnson (Matthew Coleman), and Wiley Rein (Charles Verrill).\n\n3.3 In the Letter, the Respondent invokes section 116 of the Zimbabwean Companies Act to request documents in relation to sixty-six entities listed in the Letter. The Letter ignores the fact that the requested documents were provided by the Claimants with their Memorial for twenty-nine of the sixty-six listed entities. The Respondent in the Letter implies that it, not the Tribunal, will be the sole arbiter of what is discloseable. In the Letter the Respondent states:\n\n\"In pursuit of Section 116 of the Companies Act, of Zimbabwe, we hereby give you notice that by 10 am on Thursday 14th of June 2012, all Share Registers of the listed Companies, and of all other companies having any reference to either of the ICSID complaints, are to be made available for inspection by the Civil Division in the Ministry of Justice.\" **(see tab 1, Letter, para 1)**. (Emphasis added.)\n\n5.\n\nPart 5 of the Application sets out the specific orders sought by the Claimants by way of provisional measures.\n\n*Applicable Rules*\n------------------\n\n6.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the Tribunal may recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or on the application of a party. Rule 39(4) provides that \"the Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures [\u2026] after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\" The Tribunals are, therefore, not in a position to recommend provisional measures prior to consulting with the parties further.\n\n7.\n\nHowever, as noted above, in paragraph 1.4 of the Application the Claimants also submit that the Tribunals may consider it appropriate to make an interim order preserving the *status quo* pending the further observations of the parties. In the circumstances, I consider that the Claimants' proposal represents an appropriate course of action, especially given the potential consequences that might result from the Respondent's proposed actions.\n\n*Decision and Directions*\n-------------------------\n\n8.\n\nPending a final determination of the Claimants' Application, I direct that:\n\na. the proposed visit to the Claimants' offices by the Respondent's representatives scheduled for 10:00 am on Thursday, 14 June 2012 shall not proceed; and,\n\nb. The Respondent shall take no further steps in relation to the matters contained in its letter to the Claimants dated 11 June 2012 without the consent of the Claimants or the prior authorisation of the Tribunals.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent is requested to present any observations it may wish to make on the Application by no later than 5 pm on Wednesday, 20 June 2012 (Washington, D.C. time).\n\n10.\n\nThereafter, the Claimants are requested to present any observations in reply no later than 48 hours following receipt of the Respondent's observations.\n\n11.\n\nLeave is reserved for either party to apply at any time for amendment of these Directions.\n\nDated as of 13 June 2012."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2013-03-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Provisional Measures)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 March 2013, the Claimants brought an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"**Application**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application relates to the appearance of a number of persons on one of the Claimants' properties (\"**Smalldeel**\", which is a property located within the Claimants' Makandi Estate). The Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunals \"order the Respondent to instruct its police force to prevent people from coming onto the Makandi Estate, and to the extent that those people have already arrived on the Makandi Estate, to remove them, unless those people are authorised by the Claimants.\" (see Application, para. 1.1).\n\n3.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals have considered the Application and have decided unanimously as follows.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 6 March 2013, the Tribunal Secretary wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunals inviting the Respondent to file any observations it may have on the Application by 8 March 2013.\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the Respondent filed its observations on the Application, requesting that the Tribunals dismiss the Application (\"**Respondent's Observations**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the Tribunal Secretary wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunals inviting the Claimants to file any response it may have to the Respondent's Observations by 11 March 2013.\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent's Observations, reiterating their request that the relief set out in the Application be granted (\"**Claimants' Response**\").\n\n**III. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants submit that on 26 February 2013, a group of approximately ten persons (referred to by the Claimants as \"**the Muzite Party**\") entered the Claimants' Smalldeel property without the Claimants' authorisation. The Claimants assert that the group included, *inter alia*:\n\n(a) Superintendent Chitondwe, who is a member of the Respondent's police force and according to the Claimants purported to be acting in his official capacity as a member of the Zimbabwean police; and\n\n(b) Mr. Muzite, who is known to the Claimants, in particular from a 2010 incident during which Mr. Muzite is alleged to have threatened and assaulted the Claimants' staff and to have stolen a large amount of crops from the Makandi Estate (with one of his supporters carrying a high calibre firearm at the time).\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Application, the Muzite Party informed the Claimants' farm staff that they arrived \"to identify Mr Muzite's 100ha of land on Smalldeel\" (see Application, para. 2.4). The Claimants dispute that the Respondent has in fact allocated land on Smalldeel to Mr. Muzite by way of an Offer Letter Process or otherwise.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that on 1 March 2013, several members of the Muzite Party returned to Smalldeel, threatened the keeper of the farm's store, took possession of the store and placed a sign over the store: \"Muzite Farm\". The Claimants further allege that on the following day, a larger group of approximately 15 persons returned to Smalldeel, and threatened and chased the harvesting staff from the fields.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that on 6 March 2013, the Muzite Party commenced harvesting macadamia nuts on Smalldeel and have since physically removed some of the harvested nuts from Smalldeel.\n\n12.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the actions outlined above indicate that:\n\n(a) the Muzite Party plans to permanently occupy Smalldeel and profit from the macadamia and wheat crops (see Application, para. 2.8);\n\n(b) a risk exists that the Muzite Party will damage existing infrastructure on Smalldeel (see Application, para. 2.8); and\n\n(c) the Muzite Party will likely continue to physically intimidate and threaten the Claimants' staff, particularly in light of the 2010 events referred to at paragraph 8 above (see Application, para. 2.9).\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants state that they have unsuccessfully sought assistance from the local police, who \"appear to be intimidated by the involvement of Superintendent Chitondwe\" (see Application, para. 2.10). The Claimants attach to their Application a communication dated 4 March 2013 addressed to counsel for the Respondent, advising the Respondent of their position that the Superintendent's conduct is attributable to the Government of Zimbabwe.\n\n14.\n\nRelying on Article 40 and 41 of the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the Claimants submit that they seek to have the following rights preserved through the present Application (see Application, paras. 4.8 and 4.9):\n\n(a) \"rights under the BITs and customary international law not to have their property expropriated on grounds of discrimination, in serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law\"; and\n\n(b) the \"right to participate in these proceedings without threats of intimidation from members of the Respondent's police force, or other persons.\"\n\n15.\n\nIn their Application, the Claimants seek specifically that the Tribunals order the Respondent (see Application, para. 7.1):\n\n(a) to instruct its police force that only those persons who have been granted permission by the Claimants to enter the Makandi Estate may do so (**Authorised Persons**);\n\n(b) to instruct its police force to remove all persons from the Makandi Estate who are not Authorised Persons; and\n\n(c) not to take any further action to aggravate the dispute between it and the Claimants.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIn its Observations on the Application, the Respondent submits that Mr. Muzite was legally allocated subdivision 1 (a 100-ha plot) of Smalldeel farm on 10 February 2009 and that the apparent cause of the current disturbances relates to the exact boundaries of this plot (see Respondent's Observations, p. 1).\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' characterisation of the events and avers that there is no collective \"Muzite Party\", stating rather that the \"facts on the ground are that Mr Muzite considered it reasonable to harvest what was on the portion of land allocated to him in 2009\" (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent notes that there was also an incident involving Mr. Muzite in 2010 and that the \"problem\" about which the Claimants complain is not new and therefore not urgent (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n19.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Respondent confirms the following (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2-3):\n\n\"Respondent has emphasised to the police that they should ensure that the status quo at the time of the filing of Claimants' case in 2010 prevails. Respondent confirms that police are under instructions to ensure that Mr Muzite does not interfere with the Claimants' operations.\n\nRespondent invites the Arbitral Tribunal to advise Claimants that they have the option to approach the provincial police in Mutare, in the event that the district police are not acting on their reports. The provincial police have undertaken to act in the event of any such a report.\n\nClaimants' application does not indicate any attempt to engage the provincial police in the issue at hand. In the event that the provincial police were also to fail to act, the Claimants can approach the Police General Headquarters in Harare, which is aware of the ICSID proceedings.\"\n\n20.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in support of the Respondent's Observations, Superintendent Chitondwe also confirmed receipt of the following directions from the Government of Zimbabwe (see Respondent's Observations, Affidavit of Superintendent Chitondwe, para. 29):\n\n\"The Attorney General's Office advised us that the status quo as at the time proceedings were instituted in ICSID should be maintained. We have advised Mr Muzite to stay off the land in question until the ICSID matter is finalized.\"\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in any event, the criteria for ordering provisional measures are not met.\n\n**C. The Claimants' Response**\n------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants note in their Response that \"the Respondent appears to have accepted the substance of the Claimants' application of 6 March 2013\", based on the fact that \"the Police appear to have been instructed to act against the Muzite Party, which they have done\" (see Claimants' Response, para. 1.2). Nevertheless, the Claimants state that they continue to feel intimidated by the fact that threats were made against their staff and because the police were allegedly a party to those threats. As a result, the Claimants maintain their Application and request that they be granted the relief set out at paragraph 15 above.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants record the following events since the filing of their Application, supported by the witness statement of Nicholas Shaxson, a senior manager of the Makandi Estate (see Claimants' Response, paras. 2.2 to 2.8):\n\n\"2.2 One matter that was not mentioned in the background facts to the application of 6 March 2013 is that one of the Makandi Estate's tractor drivers, together with a security officer, confronted the Muzite Party on Smalldeel. As a consequence both were questioned by the Police, and the tractor driver was taken into Police custody. The Police released the tractor driver without charge after this application was made. The security officer was also questioned for allegedly defaming President Mugabe. The defamation matter has not been dropped (Shaxson, para 5, tab 1).\n\n2.3 On 6 March 2013, two local Policemen were placed on the Smalldeel Estate. However, they merely observed matters, and did not intervene in the subsequent removal of crops from Smalldeel (Shaxson, para 6, tab 1).\n\n2.4 On the morning of Thursday, 7 March 2013, members of the Muzite Party removed five pickup loads of macadamia nuts from Smalldeel, which is equivalent to approximately two tonnes. These macadamia nuts were transported to another farm, Rosalie, which is now run by a member of the ZANU-PF political party. This theft was reported to the local Police. In response, the local Police informed the Claimants that they were awaiting instructions from District Police Headquarters as to how they should deal with this matter (Shaxson, para 7, tab 1).\n\n2.5 Later on in the morning of Thursday, 7 March 2013, members of the Muzite Party began to steal the staff's maize stocks. Approximately one tonne of maize was taken from the staff. This caused a great deal of concern because it was thought very unlikely that the Makandi staff would tolerate the theft of their own food. Later on that day the Police attended Smalldeel and ordered the Muzite party to return the maize and to stop harvesting the macadamia nuts. However, the Muzite Party continued to harvest macadamia nuts on Thursday night (Shaxson, para 8, tab 1).\n\n2.6 On Friday 8 March 2013, Mr Shaxson was informed by the local Police that the Attorney-General's office had become involved in this matter, and had made comments to the effect that \"they were not risking 128 million dollars for the sake on one individuals\" (Shaxson, para 9, tab 1).\n\n2.7 By Saturday morning, 9 March 2013, the Muzite Party's harvesting gang left Smalldeel. However, Mr Muzite and members of the Muzite Party remained in the store near the Smalldeel fields. On Saturday morning Mr Shaxson was informed by the local Police that they were on their way to evict Mr Muzite. The local Police asked Mr Shaxson to intercept a truck that the Muzite party had loaded with three tonnes of macadamia nuts that were harvested from Smalldeel on Friday. These are the same nuts that the local Police had previously watched Mr Muzite take from Smalldeel. Mr Shaxson did not intercept the truck, but the Police did (Shaxson, para 10, tab 1).\n\n2.8 In the evening of Saturday 9 March 2013, Mr Shaxson was informed by the local Police that the Muzite Party had been given until Sunday morning to leave the store. During Saturday night the Muzite party departed Smalldeel (Shaxson, para 11, tab 1).\"\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants insist that the police will only act if applications for provisional measures are made to the Arbitral Tribunals, and that it is not good enough for the Respondent to suggest that they simply \"keep climbing the Police ladder to Provincial level until someone will respond to them\" (see Claimants' Response, paras. 4.1 and 5.7). As a result, the Claimants maintain their Application.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals wish to record the fact that the Application has been considered on a without prejudice basis insofar as the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction are concerned. Additionally, while neither Party has addressed the question of *prima facie* jurisdiction in its submissions, the Tribunals are satisfied, based on the reasoning set out below, that the absence of any such submissions is not fatal to their disposing of the Application in the present Procedural Order.\n\n26.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals note the Respondent's statement that it has instructed its police to maintain the status quo as of the date on which the Claimants initiated ICSID proceedings and, in particular, to ensure that Mr. Muzite does not interfere with the Claimants' operations at Smalldeel. The Tribunals also note the Respondent's statement that the provincial police have undertaken to act on any reports they receive in relation to this matter.\n\n27.\n\nIn their Response, the Claimants confirm that the police have progressively taken steps since the date of filing of the Application (i.e., 6 March 2013) to ensure the removal of Mr. Muzite and his party and that certain food stocks and harvested crops, if not all, have been restored to Smalldeel farm with the assistance of the police.\n\n28.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals note that the Claimants continue to \"feel intimidated\" by the threats made against their staff and that this intimidation is \"heightened by the fact that the Police will not act\". However, in light of the Respondent's undertakings to ensure that the status quo is maintained and that the police will act on any reports received in relation to Smalldeel farm, as well as the Claimants' confirmation that since the date of filing their Application the police have in fact ensured the departure of Mr. Muzite and the return of certain food stocks and harvested crops, the Tribunals see no basis at this time to order the relief requested and therefore the Application is dismissed.\n\n29.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals expressly do not take a view on the merits of the Application. The Tribunals' decision is also predicated on the current factual matrix presented by the Parties in their submissions in relation to the Application and is without prejudice to any further application that either Party may seek to bring should that factual matrix change.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants have notified an additional event which took place on 6 March 2013, involving a confrontation between a security officer and tractor driver on the Makandi Estate, on the one hand, and Mr. Muzite and/or his party, on the other hand, following which the tractor driver and the security officer were questioned by the police. According to the Claimants, the security officer was questioned in particular for allegedly defaming President Mugabe and this matter has not been dropped, although no charges appear to have been brought and he has not been detained by the police. Whilst the Tribunals are sensitive to the tension that appears to exist between the Parties to these proceedings as manifested in this Application and the substantive submissions filed by both Parties in these proceedings, it is unclear what, if any, direct relation this latter event has to the specific matters before the Tribunals. As the matter presently appears to stand, the Tribunals are not persuaded that their intervention is warranted.\n\n31.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals, however, strongly encourage both Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid further aggravation of the dispute between them in order to ensure the orderly progress of these proceedings.\n\n**V. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS' DECISIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Members of the Arbitral Tribunals have deliberated and decided unanimously to dismiss the Application.\n\n33.\n\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\n\nDated as of 16 March 2013"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2013-07-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Provisional Measures)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, the Claimants brought an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"Application\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application relates to the arrival of a group of people referred to as the \"Thornton Party\" onto Thornton Farm, a part of the Border Estate allegedly expropriated in 2005, and the Respondent's alleged refusal of the Claimants' requests to remove them. According to the Claimants, some of the members of the Thornton Party appear to have been displaced from a neighboring community as a result of a diamond mining operation in which the Respondent is involved. The Claimants further state that the Thornton Party has shown an intention to permanently occupy Thornton Farm, has caused extensive damage to property and has attacked the workers' village on Thornton Farm.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants seek an order directing the Respondent to instruct its police force to prevent all persons from coming onto the Forrester Estate, the Border Estate and the Makandi Estate (the \"Estates\"), and to the extent that those people have already arrived on the Estates, to remove them, unless they are authorized by the Claimants.\n\n4.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals have considered the Application and have decided unanimously as follows:\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, the Tribunals' Secretary wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunals inviting the Respondent to file any observations it may have on the Application by 9 July 2013.\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, the Respondent filed its observations on the Application, requesting that the Tribunals dismiss the Application (the \"Respondent's Observations\").\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants submit that if the requested order is not made there is a serious risk of catastrophic forest fires on the Border Estate during the forthcoming dry season in Zimbabwe, which \"will destroy one of the very investments that are the subject of these proceedings (the forest plantations on Thornton Farm)\" (see Application, para. 1.4). The Claimants also submit that if the order is not granted, they will be unable to participate in these proceedings without being intimidated and the dispute will be aggravated.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Thornton Party moved onto the Thornton Farm in December 2012 and, since that time, has cleared 75 ha of pine plantation through manual means and by lighting fires. According to the Claimants, members of the Party have built homesteads and planted crops on this cleared land, and continue to clear pine plantation by lighting fires. The Claimants place significance on the lighting of fires by the Thornton Party, noting that the risk of forest fires is particularly high going into the dry season. The risk of a catastrophic forest fire is stated to be heightened because the Thornton Party has blocked access roads, rendering a timely response by fire crews difficult if not impossible. The Claimants explain that between 2002 and 2010, 13,778 ha of plantation on the Border Estate were damaged by fires, including fires lit by settlers (see Application, paras. 3.3 and 3.5).\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 January 2013, one of the Claimants, Border Timbers Limited, successfully obtained a provisional order from the local court for the eviction of the Thornton Party. This order provides as follows (see Exh. C-000860, paras. 1-4):\n\n\"The Respondents jointly, and all those acting through them are interdicted forthwith from carrying out any farming or any other activities and operations and erecting illegal structure in applicant's property namely Thornton Farm situated in Chimanimani District for which applicant has a right of occupation referred to in Applicant's Affidavit hereto.\n\nThe Respondents and all those through then [sic] are interdicted from going to applicant's property on Thornton Farm, without the applicant's express authority and consent thereby interfering with the applicant's operations in anyway in the property.\n\nThe Respondents and all those through then [sic] are ordered to give applicant and its employees undisturbed right of use to its property namely Thornton Farm, Chimanimani.\n\nThe Respondents to remove all illegal structures on Applicant's property forthwith.\"\n\nThe order was made final on 30 January 2013 and appears to remain in place to date (see Application, para. 3.10).\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 and 23 January 2013, pursuant to the provisional order, a court official and the police evicted some members of the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm. However, the Claimants state that other members of the Thornton Party evaded eviction and therefore further evictions were carried out on 9 May 2013 (see Application, para. 3.11). The Claimants further state that the situation in recent weeks has escalated, allegedly due to the political activities of Mr. Robert Sacco and his son, Mr. Joshua Sacco, whereby they have encouraged more people to join the Thornton Party and support Joshua Sacco's bid to win the ZANU-PF primaries in the electorate of Chimanimani East, in which Thornton Farm is located. The Claimants estimate that the ranks of the Thornton Party have now swelled to at least 100 people (see Application, para. 3.15).\n\n11.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, on the evening of 2 July 2013, members of the Thornton Party attacked the workers' village on Thornton Farm, returning the following morning wielding machetes and knobkerries. The Claimants state that later that day, 3 July 2013, the police attended Thornton Farm with Joshua Sacco and asked the Thornton Party to \"co-exist\" with the Border Estate's employees. The Claimants submit that whatever the reason for the swelling in size of the Thornton Party, the Respondent has changed its attitude and now refuses to remove the Thornton Party (see Application, paras. 3.17-3.18).\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants note that they have corresponded with the Respondent's counsel on the matter and requested that the Respondent remove the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm. According to the Claimants, the Respondent stated in the course of the parties' exchanges that it cannot act without an order from the local courts and, moreover, that the order obtained on 14 January 2013 is invalid because it was obtained *ex parte*. The Claimants note that *ex parte* orders may validly be obtained in cases of urgency and that, in any event, the order was confirmed and made final. The Claimants submit that the real issue is the Respondent's refusal to act against the Thornton Party for which the Claimants speculate are political reasons relating to tensions within ZANU-PF (see Application, para. 4.1).\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants submit that although they are not required to exhaust local remedies before seeking relief from the Tribunals, there is in any event nothing further that the Claimants can do locally to evict the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm (see Application, para. 4.2). They further submit that all of the prerequisites for an order granting provisional measures are satisfied as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunals have *prima facie* jurisdiction over the merits of the disputes, as pleaded in their Requests for Arbitration and in their Memorial, and as confirmed by the Tribunal in PO No. 5 (see Application, paras. 5.1-5.2);\n\n(b) The Claimants seek the preservation of three existing rights, being (i) their entitlement to the return of Thornton Farm, including the plantations thereon; (ii) their right to participate in these proceedings without being intimidated directly or indirectly by the Respondent or other persons; and (iii) their right that the dispute between the parties is not aggravated by the Respondent (see Application, paras. 6.3-6.6);\n\n(c) The Claimants submit that the presence of the Thornton Party is highly prejudicial - and therefore meets the criterion of urgency - given the nature of the investment in question (i.e., the plantations), as their presence presents a serious risk of catastrophic forest fire that could destroy the plantations and Thornton Farm's value. The Claimants submit that their right not to be intimated and their right to the non-aggravation of the dispute is also prejudiced by the presence of the Thornton Party, noting the attack on the workers' village (see Application, paras. 8.1-8.4); and\n\n(d) The Claimants submit that irreparable harm or damage will occur \u2013 thereby satisfying the criterion of necessity \u2013 if provisional measures are not ordered because the matters engaged by the rights the preservation of which is sought in this Application cannot be fully remedied by compensation (see Application, paras. 9.1-9.4).\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants justify the scope of the order being requested, that is an order which would apply in respect of any unauthorized person entering onto any one of the three Estates, as opposed to an order applicable solely to the Thornton Party and Thornton Farm, as follows (see Application, paras. 10.2-10.6):\n\n\"The general assumption in Zimbabwe is that between now and 14 August 2013 there will be a national election. The last national election (in 2008) was marked by political violence. Human Rights Watch has warned that the forthcoming elections will also be violent. The Claimants are very concerned that if large numbers of Settlers are allowed onto the Estates it greatly increases the chances of political violence occurring on the Estates, whether between Settlers or between Settlers and the Claimants' 6.500 employees.\n\nThe chance of such violence is increased because it is reasonable to assume that the Settlers have political views that are opposed to those of the Claimants' employees (note the attack on the workers' village on 2 July 2013 \u2013 see para. 3.17 above). This divergence in political opinion arises out of a number of matters, including the fact that the ruling party, ZANU-PF, initiated the expropriation [sic: of] the Claimants' land in 2005, which the Settlers wish to occupy, but which could destroy the livelihood of the Claimants' employees.\n\nFurther, the chance of violence is increased by the fact that the congregation of large numbers of people in one place acts as magnet for political activists seeking to promote political violence.\n\nThere is also an air of despondency among some rural people partly arising out of the fact that food security is on the rise as a result of the expropriation of the large scale farming sector.\n\nFinally, there have been a number of Invasions on the Estates that have been brought to the attention of the tribunals to date. As a result of the correspondence that the Respondent had submitted to the Tribunals in regard to an earlier application for provisional measures (that concerned the Muzite Party) the Claimants had understood that the Respondent intended to instruct its Police force to stop Settlers invading the Estates. However, the Respondent appears to be no longer willing to do so, or at least to be inconsistent as to whether or not it will act in such circumstances. If the Tribunals accept the grounds of this application in regard to Thornton Farm, then those grounds are equally applicable to all properties within the three Estates. In such circumstances it would be far more efficient to have one order in regard to all of the Estates as opposed to the Claimants having to make an application each time there is an Invasion of a particular property.\" [citations omitted]\n\n**B. The Respondent's Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Border Estate is not the only forestry estate in Zimbabwe facing threats of unlawful entry or settlement. The normal route, according to the Respondent, is for owners of plantations to have recourse to civil court proceedings in order to evict any unauthorised persons on their properties. The Respondent submits that this is what the Claimants have done in the past and should do now (see Respondent's Observations, p. 1.).\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Thornton Party is a group of persons totally independent from the Respondent's control and not associated with the Land Reform Programme, and it is therefore incorrect to allege that the Respondent is violating any of the Claimants' rights. The Respondent avers, however, that it will act if this or any other group of people engage in any criminal activity (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent explains the process engaged by the Claimants through the local courts as follows (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2):\n\n\"Under domestic law, execution of the Provisional Order granted to Claimants on 14th January 2013, C-000860, meant that the court official designated to execute such orders, being the messenger of court, became *functus officio* together with the police who were empowered to arrest the Thornton Party after the successful execution of the order.\n\nIn terms of domestic procedure, any defiance of the court order after its successful execution can only be cured by an order of contempt made by the same court that granted the defied order. Such contempt order does not involve the police, as it is a civil matter where the applicant must approach the civil court on application and the concerned party is given an opportunity to respond.\n\nIn such proceedings the domestic court will issue further orders designed to stop/mitigate the contempt. In the event that such an order involves the police or any arm of the State to assist in diminishing the contempt, then the Respondent will be obliged to act.\"\n\n18.\n\nAs an alternative, the Respondent states that the Claimants could institute fresh eviction proceedings and seek an order that would require the Respondent to assist the court official charged with execution of court orders (see Respondent's Observations, p. 2).\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent observes that as primary elections have already come and gone, they are no longer an issue among the Thornton Party. Additionally, the Respondent avers that it cannot be stated with any certainty that there will be any violence in the forthcoming elections. As regards to the threat of fires, the Respondent dismisses the Claimants' reliance on destruction caused to timber plantations over the period from 2002 to 2010 in support of an alleged issue arising in 2012, submitting that this is not a new issue (see Respondent's Observations, p. 3).\n\n20.\n\nFinally, the Respondent states that even if the Arbitral Tribunals were minded to grant provisional measures with regard to Thornton Farm, there would be no justification for extending the relief to the other Estates, as provisional measures are extraordinary and should be limited to exceptional situations and circumstances that require such measures to be issued (see Respondent's Observations, p. 3).\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunals recall that Procedural Order No. 4, dated 16 March 2013 (\"PO No. 4\"), and Procedural Order No. 5, dated 3 April 2013 (\"PO No. 5\"), both dealt with applications for provisional measures brought by the Claimants pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The legal framework for the grant of provisional measures under the ICSID Convention is set out in those provisional orders and shall not, therefore, be repeated here. It is useful, however, to recall briefly the applications which were the subject of PO No. 4 and PO No. 5, including their disposition.\n\n22.\n\nIn PO No. 4, the Arbitral Tribunals considered the Claimants' application for an order instructing the police to prevent persons from entering onto Smalldeel farm, a property located on the Makandi Estate and, as the case may be, to remove any unauthorised persons already on the property (i.e., the \"Muzite Party\"). The Tribunals dismissed the application without prejudice to any further application that either Party might wish to bring on the basis that the Respondent had voluntarily provided undertakings to ensure that the *status quo* was maintained and directed the police to remove the offending persons, and that the provincial police had undertaken to act on any reports they received in relation to the matter (see PO No. 4, paras. 26-28). The Tribunals nevertheless strongly encouraged the Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid the aggravation of the dispute.\n\n23.\n\nIn PO No. 5, the Arbitral Tribunals considered a second application by the Claimants for an order, *inter alia*, that the Respondent instruct its Central Intelligence Organisation, police and all other Security Services in Zimbabwe not to harm Heinrich von Pezold or any of the other Claimants, their families and staff. The Tribunals granted the requested relief in part, ordering the Respondent to \"immediately take all necessary measures to protect the life and safety of the Claimants, and in particular Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, from any harm by any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent\" (the \"Protection Measures\") and to report on the Protection Measures adopted at regular intervals. The Respondent's reporting obligations were also addressed during the 21 May 2013 telephone conference held between the President of the Tribunals and the parties, and later summarized in a letter from the Tribunals' Secretary to the Parties, dated 23 May 2013, as follows:\n\n\"While the proceedings are suspended, the Respondent's reporting obligations pursuant to Procedural order No. 5 remain in place: the Respondent is to continue to provide an update to the Members of the Tribunals on the 15th of each month until the commencement of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits.\"\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunals were satisfied on the evidence presented in support of the application the subject of PO No. 5 that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures were met and therefore the Tribunals issued an order that they considered to be proportionate to the concerns raised in the Claimants' application.\n\n25.\n\nIn the present Application, however, the Tribunals are not satisfied on the evidence that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures, and in particular those of urgency and necessity, are met. The Claimants essentially seek an order directing the Respondent to instruct its police force (i) to prevent any and all unauthorized persons from coming onto any one of the three Estates and, (ii) with respect to any unauthorized persons presently on any one of the Estates (since 8 July 2010), to remove such persons. Such an order is extremely broad in scope and, in the Tribunals' view, disproportionate to the matters raised in the Application.\n\n26.\n\nThe matters raised in the Application primarily relate to the recent unauthorised entry onto Thornton Farm, property located within the Border Estate, of the Thornton Party and activities in which the members of the Thornton Party have engaged which allegedly jeopardize the value of Thornton Farm and intimidate the Claimants' and/or their employees on Thornton Farm. The Claimants acknowledge that the factual background to their Application \"largely concerns the Thornton Farm\", yet submit that an order covering the whole of all three of the Estates would nonetheless be appropriate for the reasons articulated at paragraph 14 above. These reasons appear to be inspired primarily by fears of political violence that may occur in connection with upcoming national elections in Zimbabwe and on the Estates in particular, and concern that the Respondent may no longer be willing to instruct its police force to ensure the *status quo* during the pendency of these proceedings, as it had committed to do in response to the application the subject of PO No. 4. The Claimants reason that the most efficient course in the circumstances would therefore be to secure a single order applicable to all of the Estates rather than make an application each and every time there is an invasion of a particular property.\n\n27.\n\nWhilst the Tribunals are sensitive to the concerns raised by the Claimants in respect of unauthorised persons entering onto the Estates and, in particular, concerns relating to the aggravation of the disputes, efficiency is not a sufficiently compelling reason for granting the breadth of relief requested by the Claimants, nor is a general concern regarding the \"chance\" for increased or future political violence. It is nigh impossible to assess whether the circumstances require the Tribunals to recommend that provisional measures be taken to preserve the Claimants rights, as is the Tribunals' mandate under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules, in the absence of a specific factual matrix against which criteria of necessity and urgency, for example, may be considered. The Tribunals are not persuaded on the basis of the Application with which they are presently seized that the broad relief requested by the Claimants is required.\n\n28.\n\nEven were the Tribunals to consider a narrower scope of relief pertaining exclusively to the unauthorized presence of the Thornton Party on Thornton Farm, the Tribunals are still not persuaded that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures are satisfied. In considering the necessity of provisional relief, the Tribunals note, in particular, that the Claimants successfully obtained an order from a local court in January 2013, which remains in force, ordering the eviction of the Thornton Party from Thornton Farm, the removal of any structures built on the property, and the exclusion of the Thornton Party from re-entering the property without the Claimants' authorization. The Claimants themselves state that evictions have been successfully carried out pursuant to the order twice since its issuance (see Application, paras. 3.11 and 3.12).\n\n29.\n\nAlthough it appears that there may have developed some reluctance more recently by local law enforcement to assist in carrying out the order, there is, as described above, a process in place for the Claimants to challenge any non-compliance with the order through contempt proceedings. Notwithstanding the Claimants' submission that they are not required to exhaust local remedies before seeking provisional relief, there is no evidence before the Tribunals that seeking the assistance of the local court through contempt proceedings is likely to be futile. On the contrary, the local court appears to have responded swiftly in response to the Claimants' previous request for assistance.\n\n30.\n\nSimilarly, with respect to the urgency criterion, the Tribunals note that the primary elections which were alleged to have been the reason for a swelling in the ranks of the Thornton Party following issuance of the eviction order have, according to the Respondent, \"come and gone\" (see Respondent's Observation, p. 3). The stated impetus for an escalation of events at Thornton Farm in disregard of the eviction order therefore appears to have passed.\n\n31.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunals dismiss the Claimants' application without prejudice to any future application that they may wish to bring should circumstances in relation to Thornton Farm or any other property located on the Estates change.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunals also record their concern over the matters raised in the Application. The Respondent's failure to address the Claimants' assertion that the police attended at Thornton Farm following the events of 2 July 2013 and asked the Thornton Party to \"co-exist\" with the Border Estate's employees (see Application, para. 3.17) is troubling in view of the eviction order, issued by the local court, in force at the time. The Respondent acknowledged in its Observations that, under Zimbabwean law, the \"messenger of court, became *functus officio* together with the police who were empowered to arrest the Thornton Party after the successful execution of the order.\" (see Respondent's Observation, p. 2; emphasis added). It is therefore somewhat disingenuous for the Respondent to state that \"it is up to the Claimants to obtain court orders for the eviction of the group using the normal court process\", given that such an order was in place when the police allegedly attended at Thornton Farm on 3 July 2013.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunals reiterate their strong encouragement of the Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid further aggravation of the disputes between them. In this connection, the Tribunals consider that the undertakings provided by the Respondent in response to the application disposed of in PO No. 4 are continuing insofar as they reflect the Respondent's general obligation to ensure that its organs, such as the police, maintain the *status quo* as at the time of the filing of the Claimants' cases in 2010 and carry out their official duties in good faith (see Respondent's letter of 8 March 2013, p. 2).\n\n**IV.

See Mem., Glossary.\n\n**I Introduction**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present Award settles disputes that have arisen between the von Pezold Claimants, defined below, and the Republic of Zimbabwe **(\"Zimbabwe\"** or the **\"Respondent\")** and that have been submitted to arbitration pursuant to the dispute settlement provisions of the bilateral investment treaties entered Into between the Federal Republic of Germany and Zimbabwe on 29 September 1995 (the **\"German BIT\")** and between the Swiss Confederation and Zimbabwe on 15 August 1996 (the **\"Swiss BIT\"),** respectively.\n\n2.\n\nThis case is, at its heart, a land dispute, but one with deep context and history. As will be seen, although the dispute, the subject of this arbitration, relates primarily to the alleged expropriation in the 21st century by Zimbabwe of land and other property held by the von Pezold Claimants further to its Land Reform Programme **(\"LRP\"),** It can only be fully understood If one casts one\u2019s mind back to the colonial era of the 20th century, when Zimbabwe was known as Southern Rhodesia.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing Zimbabwe\u2019s Independence and the election of Robert Mugabe as President in 1980, the land policies of the Rhodesian era which favored the white minority population were reversed and replaced with land policies favouring the black Indigenous population. Those policies, accompanied by the Invasions of private land by settlers, feature prominently in this arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nOftentimes during these proceedings, members of the Tribunal had to remind themselves that their remit was not one of a commission of Inquiry Into what has been described as \"the March of History\", but rather strictly that of an Arbitral Tribunal mandated to adjudicate a dispute or disputes inaccordance with the Convention of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\")** and applicable law. This, the Tribunal has sought to do.\n\n**II The Conjoined Proceedings**\n--------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nAs will be seen later2, two Identically composed Tribunals were constituted to hear disputes intwo separate arbitrations: ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15 and ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25. During the Joint First Session of the two Tribunals on 7 February 2011, the Parties to ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15 and ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25 agreed that these cases would be heard together, although they would not be formally consolidated, and that the two Tribunals would render two separate Awards in relation to each case.\n\nSee below at paras. 15-16.\n\n6.\n\nIn fact, during nearly four years of proceedings, the two cases were heard together and the Parties submitted joint pleadings and evidence, the Respondent in particular rarely specifying which arguments or submissions related to the von Pezold Claimants or to the Border Claimants, as defined below.\n\n7.\n\nAs a result of these unique conjoined and intertwined proceedings, each Tribunal now renders a separate Award which contains not only the decision of each Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which each decision is based, but also the decision of the other Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which those decisions are based.\n\n8.\n\nA detailed procedural history of these cases, setting out the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s approach to the preparation of the present Award, as well as the conduct of the proceedings, follows.\n\n**III Procedure**\n-----------------\n\n**A. The Registration of the Requests for Arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) The von Pezold Arbitration\n------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 11 June 2010, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from Bernhard Friedrich Arnd R\u00fcdiger von Pezold **(\"Rudiger\")** and Elisabeth Regina Maria Gabriele von Pezold **(\"Elisabeth\")** (together, the **\"Parent Claimants\")** and their children, Anna Eleonore Elisabeth Webber (n\u00e9e von Pezold), Heinrich Bernd Alexander Josef von Pezold, Maria Juliane Andrea Christiane Katharina Batth\u00e0ny (n\u00e9e von Pezold), Georg Philipp Marcel Johann Lukas von Pezold, Felix Alard Moritz Hermann Kilian von Pezold, Johann Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Pezold (together the **\"Adult Children Claimants\")** and Adam Friedrich Carl Leopold Franz Severin von Pezold **(\"Adam\")** (collectively, the **\"von Pezold Claimants\").**\n\n10.\n\nSave for R\u00fcdiger, who is German and claims only under the German BIT, all of the von Pezold Claimants are both German and Swiss nationals, and therefore advance their claims under both the German BIT and the Swiss BIT.\n\n11.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the von Pezold Request for Arbitration on 8 July 2010. The case was assigned ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15.\n\n(2) The Border Arbitration\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from Border Timbers Limited **(\"Border\"),** Timber Products International (Private) Limited3**(\"Border International\")** and Hangani Development Co. (Private) Limited **(\"Hangani\")** (collectively, the **\"Border Claimants\"),** invoking the ICSID arbitration provisions of the Swiss BIT. The Border Claimants are all companies Incorporated in Zimbabwe, but claim Swiss nationality through their collective alleged control by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\nFormerly \"Border Timbers International (Private) Limited\". By communication dated 1 December 2014, counsel for the Border Claimants Informed the Tribunal that the second Claimant in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25 had changed its name from \"Border Timbers International (Private) Limited\" to \"Timber Products International (Private) Limited\". The Respondent objected to this name change by letter dated 2 July 2015. Following submissions by the parties, the Tribunal, on 13 July 2015, rejected the Respondent\u2019s request to retain the same names of the Parties as listed in these proceedings until 1 December 2014, having been provided with a certificate Indicating the name change issued by the relevant Zimbabwean authorities.\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 December 2010, the Border Claimants supplemented their Request for Arbitration, in response to an Inquiry by ICSID. The Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Border Request for Arbitration, as supplemented, on 20 December 2010. The case was assigned ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25.\n\n14.\n\nReference to the \"Claimants\", for purposes of the present Award, without further specification, is a reference to both the von Pezold Claimants of Case No. ARB/10/15 and the Border Claimants of Case No. ARB/10/25. Similarly, reference to the \"Parties\", for purposes of the present Award, without further specification, refers to both the von Pezold Claimants of Case No. ARB/10/15, the Border Claimants of Case No. ARB/10/25, and the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\n**B. Constitution of the two Tribunals**\n----------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nAs agreed by the Parties, the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15 was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the President of the Tribunal to be appointed by the two co-arbitrators. The Tribunal was constituted on 9 December 2010 in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID 2006 Arbitration Rules. It was composed of The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, P.C., C.C., Q.C. (a national of Canada), appointed by agreement of the coarbitrators to serve as President, Professor David A.R. Williams, Q.C. (a national of New Zealand), appointed by the von Pezold Claimants, and Professor A. Peter Mutharika (a national of Malawi), appointed by the Respondent. Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Frauke Nitschke replaced Mr. Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor as Secretary of the Tribunal on 25 January 2011.\n\n16.\n\nBy letters of 28 December 2010 and 3 January 2011, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal in the Border Arbitration, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25, was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the Parties. The Parties further agreed that the composition of the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25 was to be Identical to the one constituted in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15. The Tribunal in the Border Arbitration was constituted on 20 January 2011 in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. On the same day, Ms. Frauke Nitschke was appointed as Secretary to the two Tribunals.\n\n**C. The Joint First Session and Hearing the Cases Together**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), a first session was held on 7 February 2011 in London, England. Pursuant to an agreement by the Parties, the first session was held as a joint first session for ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/15 and ARB/10/25 (the **\"Joint First Session\").**\n\n18.\n\nThe Joint First Session considered matters listed on a provisional agenda circulated by the Secretary of the two Tribunals on 25 January 2011. The Claimants submitted their positions regarding the items on the provisional agenda in writing on 4 February 2011. No written response to the provisional agenda was received from the Respondent prior to the Joint First Session.\n\n19.\n\nThe Joint First Session was attended in person by the three Members of the two Tribunals, the Secretary to the Tribunals, and Messrs. Matthew Coleman, Kevin Williams, Anthony Rapa and Ms. Helen Aldridge of Steptoe & Johnson, and Mr. Charles O. Verrill, Jr. of Wiley Rein LLP. As agreed by the Parties, the Respondent\u2019s representatives, Advocate Prince Machaya, and Mmes. Sophia Christina Tsvakwi, Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell, and Elizabeth Sumowah, participated by video-conference from Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\n20.\n\nIn their letter of 4 February 2011, and at the Joint First Session, the Claimants confirmed that the two Tribunals were properly constituted, and that they did not have any objection to the appointment of any member of the two Tribunals. During the Joint First Session, the Respondent also confirmed that the two Tribunals were properly constituted, and that it did not have any objection to the appointment of any member of the two Tribunals.\n\n21.\n\nFollowing a proposal by the Tribunals during the Joint First Session that Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault serve as assistant to the Tribunals in these two proceedings, and the Parties\u2019 subsequent agreement thereto, Ms. Th\u00e9riault was appointed to serve as Assistant to the two Tribunals. In-February 2012, with the agreement of the Parties, Ms. Alison FitzGerald replaced Ms. Th\u00e9riault to serve as Assistant to the two Tribunals.\n\n22.\n\nDuring the Joint First Session, as reflected in the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session of the two Arbitral Tribunals4 the Parties further agreed *inter alia* to follow the procedural approach for the two cases as proposed by the Claimants in their letter of 4 February 2011 :\n\n22.1 Case Bernhard von Pezold & Ors v The Republic of Zimbabwe ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, and case Border Timbers Limited & Ors v The Republic of Zimbabwe ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25 shall be heard together (but not formally consolidated).\n\n22.2 The Claimants will submit joint pleadings, but will separately address those issues within a pleading where circumstances distinct to particular Claimants and/or case necessitate separate treatment.\n\n22.3 Each witness statement and expert report shall state whether it applies to one case or the other case.\n\n22.4 The Tribunal shall issue separate awards in relation to each case but may nevertheless discuss these arbitrations in any award or procedural order as a single set of proceedings, except where circumstances distinct to particular Claimants necessitate separate treatment.\n\nThe Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session of the two Arbitral Tribunals were transmitted to the parties on 30 March 2011, following the parties\u2019 agreement on the appointment of the Tribunals\u2019 assistant.\n\n23.\n\nThis latter agreement of the Parties was confirmed by the Tribunals in their Procedural Order No. 13 issued on 23 December 20145.\n\nReproduced as Annex 13 to the present Award\n\n**D. Reconstitution of the two Tribunals**\n------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 6 June 2011, ICSID notified the Parties that Professor A. Peter Mutharika had submitted his resignation as arbitrator in both ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/15 and ARB/10/25, and that the two proceedings were suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2) until the vacancies resulting from Professor Mutharika\u2019s resignation had been filled. On 1 July 2011, ICSID notified the Parties pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2) that the Tribunals had consented to Professor Mutharika\u2019s resignations in the two proceedings and that, inaccordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1), the vacancy on the Tribunals resulting from Professor Mutharika\u2019s resignation shall be promptly filled by the same method by which Professor Mutharika\u2019s appointments had been made.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 13 July 2011, the Respondent appointed Mr. Rajsoomer Lallah as arbitrator in the two proceedings. By letter of 25 July 2011, ICSID notified the Parties that Mr. Lallah was unavailable to accept the appointments and invited the Respondent to proceed to appoint another arbitrator in these two proceedings. On 12 August 2011, the Respondent appointed Professor An Chen, a national of the People\u2019s Republic of China, as arbitrator in the two proceedings, and Professor Chen subsequently accepted his appointments. The two Tribunals were reconstituted on 15 September 2011, and the proceedings resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 12.\n\n26.\n\nOn 19 May 2013, ICSID notified the Parties pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(1) that Professor An Chen had submitted his resignation as arbitrator in these two proceedings. The proceedings were subsequently suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2). The two Tribunals consented to Professor Chen\u2019s resignation on 20 May 2013 pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), and the Respondent was invited to appoint an arbitrator to each of the two Tribunals.\n\n27.\n\nOn 1 July 2013, the Respondent appointed Mr. Michael Hwang, a national of Singapore, to fill the vacancy on the two Tribunals. Mr. Hwang subsequently accepted his appointments. The two Tribunals were reconstituted on 3 July 2013, and the proceedings resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 12.\n\n**E. Written and Oral Procedure**\n---------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nDuring the Joint First Session held on 7 February 2011, the Respondent had stated that it did not intend to file any objections to jurisdiction, and that it agreed with the timetable proposed by the Claimants in their letter of 4 February 2011, which consisted of a schedule for two rounds of written pleadings on the merits (Involving the filing of a Memorial, a Counter-Memorial, a Reply and a Rejoinder), to be followed by an oral procedure on the merits. As discussed below, the Respondent did, in fact, raise objections to jurisdiction.\n\n29.\n\nAccordingly, following the Joint First Session, the procedural calendar for the written and oral procedure was amended multiple times, either following an agreement by the Parties, or as directed by the Tribunal.\n\n(1) The Written Procedure\n-------------------------\n\na) The Parties\u2019 principal written pleadings\n-------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 principal written pleadings, as contemplated by the Parties\u2019 original agreement to two rounds of written pleadings, are listed at numbers 1-4 in the table below. As discussed in more detail in the context of Procedural Order No. 3, dated 11 January 2013, and contrary to the indication made during the Joint First Session, the Respondent filed objections to jurisdiction in its Rejoinder. In light of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Procedural Order No. 3, which admitted into the record those objections pleaded by the Respondent In its Rejoinder, and subsequent directions from the Tribunal, the Parties filed further written submissions. The Parties\u2019 further written submissions are listed at numbers 5-25, which are also set out below:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No. | Pleading | Party | Date | Abbreviation |\n| 1. | Memorial on the Merits | Claimants | 15 November 2011 | Mem. |\n| 2. | Counter-Memorial on the Merits | Respondent | 11 August 2012 | CM |\n| 3. | Reply on the Merits and Ancillary Claims | Claimants | 12 October 2012 | Reply |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No. | Pleading | Party | Date | Abbreviation |\n| 4. | Rejoinder on the Merits, including Objections to Jurisdiction to the Claimants\u2019 Original Claim & Observations on Ancillary Claims | Respondent | 14 December 2012 | Rejoinder |\n| 5. | Observations on the Rejoinder and a Response to Observations on Ancillary Claims | Claimants | 1 March 2012 | Surrejoinder |\n| 6. | Response to Observations on the Rejoinder | Respondent | 19 April 2013 | Rebutter |\n| 7. | Updated Request for Relief | Claimants | 15 May 2013 |  |\n| 8. | Corrected *Quantum* | Claimants | 15 May 2013 |  |\n| 9. | Re-Rebutter (i.e., addendum to the Respondent\u2019s 19 April 2013 Submission) | Respondent | 15 August 2013 | Re-Rebutter |\n| 10. | Response to Re-Rebutter (i.e. observations on the Respondent\u2019s submission of 15 August 2013) | Claimants | 9 September 2013 | Re-Rebutter Response |\n| 11. | Observations on the Claimants\u2019 Updated Request for Relief | Respondent | 9 September 2013 |  |\n| 12. | Updated *Quantum* Reply | Respondent | 9 September 2013 |  |\n| 13. | Reply to Response to Re-Rebutter (i.e., response to the Claimants\u2019 submission of 9 September 2013) | Respondent | 26 September 2013 | Re-Rebutter Reply |\n| 14. | Response to the Respondent\u2019s submission of 9 September 2013 | Claimants | 26 September 2013 | Claimants\u2019 9 September Response |\n| 15. | Skeleton Argument | Claimants | 14 October 2013 | Cl.

Reply Costs Submission |\n\n31.\n\nThe voluminous nature of the Parties\u2019 pleadings and evidence cannot be overstated. The Parties have filed approximately 3,000 pages of pleadings alone. The motion practice in these two cases has also been extensive, adding hundreds of additional pages to these arbitrations in procedural orders and directions and contributing to the overall lengthening of the procedure.\n\nb) Instruments issued by the Tribunal in the course of the proceedings\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Procedural Order No. 1\n--------------------------\n\n32.\n\nProcedural Order No. 16, dated 31 October 2011, related to document production and disposed of certain outstanding requests for documents made by the Claimants.\n\nReproduced as Annex 1 to the present Award.\n\n(ii) President\u2019s Directions of 13 June 2012\n-------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nOn 12 June 2012, the Claimants brought an urgent application for provisional measures pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 relating to a request for disclosure of documents made outside of the procedure agreed between the Parties and recorded in the Minutes of the Joint First Session.\n\n34.\n\nOn 13 June 2012, the President of the Tribunal issued directions concerning the Claimants\u2019 12 June 2012 application pursuant to para. 5.3 of the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session, including, *inter alia,* a proposed briefing schedule.\n\n35.\n\nOn 20 June 2012, the Respondent Indicated that it did not see a need to file any observations in this matter and undertook that any future requests for disclosure would comply with the disclosure regime ordered by the Tribunal at the Joint First Session. The Claimants filed observations on the Respondent\u2019s 20 June 2012 letter on the same day expressing some residual concern. The Tribunal considered, however, that, in view of the Respondent\u2019s undertaking, the Claimants\u2019 application had become moot.\n\n(iii) Procedural Order No. 2\n----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, dated 26 June 20127, disposed of a petition by the European Centre for Constitution and Human Rights **(\"ECCHR\")** and four Indigenous communities of Zimbabwe for leave to participate as *amicus curiae* **(\"Petitioners\").** Specifically, the ECCHR and the indigenous communities petitioned the Tribunal (i) for permission to file a written submission as joint *amici curiae-,* (ii) for access to the key arbitration documents; and (iii) for permission to attend the oral hearings and to reply to any specific questions of the Tribunal on the written submissions.\n\nReproduced as Annex 2 to the present Award.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants opposed the petition on several substantive grounds and noted that the Parties had agreed during the Joint First Session that no non-disputing party submissions would be made. The Claimants therefore took the position that the Tribunal had no residual discretion under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention to admit any such submissions into the record. The Respondent advised that, while the Parties had agreed that ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) would not apply to these proceedings, it had not anticipated that there could be any person or organisation with an Interest in the matter apart from the Parties. The Respondent further stated that it had no objection to the Petitioners being allowed to file written submissions provided they fell within the scope of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) and did not impinge on or amount to a challenge to the sovereignty and territorial Integrity of Zimbabwe.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal denied the petition in Its entirety. The Tribunal held that it had the discretion, upon consulting with the Parties, to allow a non-disputing party to file a written submission pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), provided that certain minimum criteria were met. In this case, the Tribunal considered that the circumstances of the petition gave rise to legitimate doubts as to the independence or neutrality of the Petitioners, and that none of the criteria set out in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) had been satisfied. The Tribunal further considered that, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions with respect to the application to file a written submission, it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the subsidiary requests for access to documents and to attend the hearings in these proceedings. The Tribunal noted, however, that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(2), where a party objects to the request of a non-disputing party to attend the hearings in a proceeding, a tribunal has no discretion to grant such a request over that party\u2019s objection, and that, accordingly, the Petitioners\u2019 request to attend the hearings in these proceedings must be denied in any event, as the Claimants had objected thereto.\n\n(iv) Procedural Order No. 3\n---------------------------\n\n39.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, dated 11 January 2013 **(\"PO No. 3\")8,** disposed of an urgent application brought by the Claimants on 20 December 2012 in connection with jurisdictional challenges and new defences allegedly pleaded by the Respondent in its Rejoinder, filed with the Tribunal on 14 December 2012. The Claimants sought an order that the alleged jurisdictional challenges and new defences, insofar as they related to the Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded in the Memorial, were inadmissible or, alternatively, an order directing (i) that the jurisdictional challenges be joined to the merits of the cases and an additional round of briefing on these and the new defences be scheduled; (ii) that certain documents in support of the Rejoinder be produced; and (iii) that new, mutually acceptable hearing dates be set.\n\nReproduced as Annex 3 to the present Award.\n\n40.\n\nFollowing two rounds of written submissions by the Parties, the Tribunal admitted the Respondent\u2019s challenges to jurisdiction, certain of which related to ancillary claims raised by the Claimants in their Reply, and others of which related to the Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded in the Memorial, having found \"special circumstances\" to exist within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), and joined all of the challenges to jurisdiction to the merits of the two cases. Among the special circumstances, the Tribunal noted the retention by the Respondent of external counsel, Mr. Philip Kimbrough of Kimbrough &Associ\u00e9s, notified by the Respondent on 14 December 2012.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal further vacated the February 2013 hearing dates and, in consultation with the Parties, confirmed new hearing dates from 10 to 14 June 2013 (also preserving a sixth hearing day as per the Parties\u2019 agreement). Finally, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to provide copies of documents referred to in its Rejoinder and directed a new briefing schedule in connection with the new jurisdictional objections and the Respondent\u2019s comments on the Claimants\u2019 ancillary claims.\n\n(v) Procedural Order No. 4\n--------------------------\n\n42.\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, dated 16 March 2013 **(\"PO No. 4\")9,** disposed of an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, which was brought by the Claimants on 6 March 2013. The application related to the appearance of a number of persons on one of the Claimants\u2019 properties in Zimbabwe, and the Claimants requested that the Tribunal \"order the Respondent to instruct its police force to prevent people from coming onto the Claimants\u2019 Estate, and to the extent that those people have already arrived on the Claimants\u2019 Estate, to remove them, unless those people are authorised by the Claimants\".\n\nReproduced as Annex 4 to the present Award.\n\n43.\n\nFollowing several written submissions by the Parties, the Tribunal issued PO No. 4, noting the Respondent\u2019s statement that it had instructed its police to maintain the *status quo* as of the date on which the Claimants had initiated ICSID proceedings, and to ensure that a certain person not interfere with the Claimants\u2019 operations on the said property. The Tribunal also noted the Respondent\u2019s statement that the provincial police had undertaken to act on any reports they received in relation to this matter and the Claimants\u2019 confirmation that the police had progressively taken steps since the date of the Claimants\u2019 application to ensure the removal of the persons in question from the property and that certain food stocks and harvested crops had been restored with the assistance of the police. Inlight of the Respondent\u2019s undertakings, the Tribunal saw no basis to order the relief requested and dismissed the application. The Tribunal noted, however, that it did not take a view on the merits of the application given the factual matrix presented by the Parties, and that its ruling was without prejudice to any further application that either Party might seek to bring should that factual matrix change. Finally, the Tribunal strongly encouraged both Parties to conduct themselves in such a manner as to avoid further aggravation of the dispute between them in order to ensure the orderly progress of the proceedings.\n\n(vi) Procedural Order No. 5\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, dated 3 April 2013 **(\"PO No. 5\")10,** disposed of an urgent application brought by the Claimants on 8 March 2013 for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, relating to an alleged plan by the Respondent\u2019s Central Intelligence Organisation **(\"CIO\")** to kill one of the Claimants, Mr. Heinrich von Pezold.\n\nReproduced as Annex 5 to the present Award.\n\n45.\n\nOn 8 March 2013, the President of the Tribunal issued, pursuant to para. 5.3 of the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session, preliminary directions directing the Respondent to immediately take all necessary measures to protect the life and safety of the Claimants from any harm by any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent (the **\"Protection Measures\"),** and to allow the Claimants to participate, insofar as it might be possible, in the planning and the implementation of the Protection Measures. The preliminary directions also contained a briefing schedule for the Parties\u2019 written observations.\n\n46.\n\nFollowing two rounds of written submissions, the Tribunal issued PO No. 5, finding that the Claimants had adduced sufficient *prima facie* evidence that instructions to kill Mr. Heinrich von Pezold had been issued to the CIO, and found that the measures which the Claimants sought were urgent and necessary, noting that any action of any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity Instructed by the Respondent which could endanger the life and safety of the Claimants, in particular the life and safety of Mr. Heinrich von Pezold, was capable of causing irreparable prejudice to their right to participate in the present proceedings. The Tribunal further found that any prejudice caused to the Respondent by issuing an order for provisional measures was far less than the risk to the life and safety of Mr. Heinrich von Pezold.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal hence confirmed its interim directions issued on 8 March 2013, and ordered the Respondent to periodically report on the Protection Measures adopted by the Respondent. In summary, the Tribunal directed: (i) that the Respondent immediately take all necessary measures to protect the life and safety of the Claimants and, in particular, Mr. Heinrich von Pezold and his family, from any harm by any member, organ or agent of the Respondent or any person or entity instructed by the Respondent; (ii) that the Respondent allow the Claimants to participate, insofar as it might be possible, in the planning and the implementation of such Protection Measures; and (iii) that the Respondent report in writing to the Trlbunal on the 15th of each subsequent month until the beginning of the hearing scheduled to commence on 10 June 2013, on the status of the Protection Measures adopted.\n\n(vii) Procedural Order No. 6\n----------------------------\n\n48.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6, dated 22 July 2013 **(\"PO No.** 6\")11, relates to an urgent application for an order for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1), by which the Claimants requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to instruct its police force to prevent all persons from coming onto certain of the Claimants\u2019 Estates, and to the extent that certain persons had already arrived onto the Estates, to remove them, unless their presence was authorized by the Claimants.\n\nReproduced as Annex 6 to the present Award\n\n49.\n\nFollowing written submissions by the Parties, the Tribunal ruled that, on the evidence provided, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the criteria for the grant of provisional measures, in particular those of urgency and necessity, were met, and that, in light of the factual situation presented, the broad relief requested by the Claimants was required. The Tribunal dismissed the application without prejudice to any future application that they might wish to bring should the factual circumstances change, and reiterated their strong encouragement of the Parties to conduct themselves in a manner so as to avoid further aggravation of the disputes between them.\n\n(viii) Procedural Order No. 7\n-----------------------------\n\n50.\n\nProcedural Order No. 7, dated 8 August 2013 **(\"PO No. 7\")12,** disposed of an application by the Claimants relating to (i) a new jurisdictional objection allegedly pleaded by the Respondent for the first time in its pleading filed on 19 April 2013 (the \"Rebutter\" listed in the table above); and (ii) \"new\" evidence filed insupport thereof and insupport also of a prior jurisdictional objection raised in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. The Claimants subsequently amended this application by agreeing to the admission of the \"new\" evidence for a limited purpose, and sought a further written procedure to respond to that evidence.\n\nReproduced as Annex 7 to the present Award.\n\n51.\n\nFollowing several written submissions by the Parties, the Tribunal decided to dismiss the Claimants\u2019 objections, and directed an additional pleading schedule forthe Parties with regard to certain of the Respondent\u2019s objections.\n\n(ix) Procedural Order No. 8\n---------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 25 September 2013, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 8 **(\"PO No. 8\")13,** disposing of a \"procedural request\" brought by the Respondent on 22 September 2013 in connection with its submission due on 23 September 2013, further to the supplemental briefing schedule directed by the Tribunal in PO No. 7. Inessence, the Respondent requested an extension of the page limit of its submission, arguing that the Claimants had raised three new arguments in their 9 September 2013 submission.\n\nReproduced as Annex 8 to the present Award.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the Respondent had been afforded ample opportunity to present its case and to defend the Claimants\u2019 claims. The Tribunal recalled PO No. 3, by which all of the Respondent\u2019s challenges to jurisdiction, including those responsive to claims pleaded in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, pleaded for the first time in the Rejoinder, were admitted. The Tribunal further recalled that, in PO No. 7, the Respondent was allowed to raise additional jurisdictional objections at an even later stage of the proceedings, and was given an opportunity to present those objections cogently in a supplemental pleading to its Rebutter, and was also given a right of reply to the Claimants\u2019 9 September 2013 submission. The Tribunal also noted that it was not persuaded that it was necessary or appropriate at this stage to reopen the directions set out in PO No. 7 so as to afford the Respondent additional pages to plead its reply to the Claimants\u2019 9 September 2013 submission. The Tribunal further noted that it was of the view that in so denying the Respondent\u2019s request, the Respondent\u2019s right to be heard was not in any way impinged, noting that the Respondent would, in addition to the opportunities afforded to it to express its views in writing, also have the opportunity to make submissions on both law and evidence in respect of these objections during the oral hearing, and in any post-hearing procedures that might be agreed by the Parties and the Tribunal, or decided by the Tribunal.\n\n(x) Procedural Order No. 9\n--------------------------\n\n54.\n\nInProcedural Order No. 9, dated 15 October 2013 **(\"PO No.** 9\")14, the Tribunal ruled on the admissibility of the various materials that were the subject of two applications brought by the Respondent on 2 October 2013 and 12 October 2013 respectively. The details of these applications and how they were disposed of by the Tribunal in PO No. 9 are set out in Section VI.F(2) of the present Award.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent\u2019s request to re-open PO No. 9 in paras. 347 to 402 of the present Award.\n\n(xi) Procedural Order No. 10\n----------------------------\n\n55.\n\nProcedural Order No. 10, dated 24 February 2014 **(\"PO No. 10\")15,** disposed of the Parties\u2019 proposed corrections to the transcripts made at the oral procedure. In PO No. 10, the Tribunal further decided to admit onto the record the post-hearing materials filed by the Respondent in response to questions posed by the Tribunal during the hearing (see below Section III.E.(2)). Finally, PO No. 10 also established the post-hearing procedure, i.e., that the Parties were to file their post-hearing briefs within 60 days from receipt of the corrected hearing transcript, and that either Party could file a brief statement with the Tribunal within 30 days from receipt of the other Party\u2019s post-hearing submission, identifying any material that that Party considered inadmissible in the other Party\u2019s submission. Finally, the Respondent\u2019s request for an extension of time for the filing of its post-hearing submission was denied.\n\nReproduced as Annex 10 to the present Award.\n\n(xii) Procedural Order No. 11\n-----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, dated 15 July 2014 **(\"PO No. 11 \")16,** disposed of the Respondent\u2019s communicated intention to file a reply to the Claimants\u2019 observations to the Respondent\u2019s procedural statement dated 2 July 2014 (the **\"Respondent\u2019s 2 July Procedural Statement\"),** and submitted in reply to the Claimants\u2019 procedural statement on inadmissibility. Although not presented with an application by the Respondent to file such a reply, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties by way of PO No. 11 that there was no need for another round of submissions and no special circumstances existed within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), to the extent applicable, that would justify allowing the Respondent a further written submission beyond what had been granted to it through the Tribunal\u2019s other procedural orders and directions.\n\nReproduced as Annex 11 to the present Award.\n\n(xiii) Procedural Order No. 12\n------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nProcedural Order No. 12, dated 5 September 2014 **(\"PO No. 12\")17,** disposed in part of certain procedural requests made by the Respondent in its 2 July Procedural Statement. The Tribunal denied procedural requests (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x), which related to the alleged \"emergence of new evidence\" in the form of assertions purportedly made by the Claimants in their 6 June Statement on Inadmissibility, and held in reserve procedural requests (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) to be disposed of in this Award (see below Section VI.F.(4)).\n\nReproduced as Annex 12 to the present Award.\n\n(xiv) Procedural Order No. 13\n-----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs noted earlier, during the Joint First Session of the two Tribunals on 7 February 2011, the Parties agreed that, while the two cases would be heard together, they would not be formally consolidated and each Tribunal would issue a separate award in relation to each case.\n\n59.\n\nIn fact, as the Tribunal wrote at the outset of the present Award, during nearly four years of proceedings, the two cases have been heard together and the Parties have abided, most of the time but not always, by their original agreement as reflected in the Minutes of the Joint First Session by submitting joint pleadings and evidence, the Respondent in particular rarely specifying which arguments or submissions related to the von Pezold Claimants or to the Border Claimants.\n\n60.\n\nAs a result of this unique situation, on 20 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their views on whether a single award or two separate awards should be rendered in these conjoined proceedings.\n\n61.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the Claimants confirmed that, in their view, it was \"imperative\" that separate awards be rendered. They wrote:\n\nIndeed, the issue of separate awards is not only a right in circumstances where there are separate proceedings, but also an imperative in these cases in order to protect the rights of the von Pezold Claimants, i.e. the claimants in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15. The imperative arises because in the event of a single award, during the enforcement phase cooperation between all of the Claimants would be necessary. Such cooperation is likely to be impossible in the event that the Respondent takes control of the Border Company Claimants, which it may do in order to jeopardise the enforcement of a single award or for other reasons.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent, on 18 December 2014, requested that a single award be rendered. The Respondent submitted:\n\nThe discussion has taken place in a unified manner, without any clear distinction in issues, briefing or oral argument. Even the Exhibits were unified and not distinguished as between cases. The matters are so intertwined that it is appropriate to resolve all issues as a single award.\n\n63.\n\nInProcedural Order No. 13 dated 23 December 2014 **(\"PO No. 13\")18,** the Tribunal found that, while the matters in issue in the two proceedings were indeed intertwined, in that they arose from substantially the same events, \"from a practical perspective and as a matter of principle\", the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants, having filed their claims independently of each other, should also be able to pursue enforcement of any award independently of each other.\n\nReproduced as Annex 13 to the present Award.\n\n64.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal confirmed in PO No. 13 that \"a separate award shall be rendered for each proceeding in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15 and ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25\".\n\n65.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal recalls that the matters at issue in these two cases arise from substantially the same events and that the Parties, as mentioned earlier, have submitted joint pleadings and evidence.\n\n66.\n\nIn the circumstances, as will be seen, the Tribunals render two separate awards which, in many respects, are identical but, where required by the terms of the ICSID Convention and/or by the pleadings of either Party, are case specific.\n\n(2) The Oral Procedure\n----------------------\n\n67.\n\nDuring the Joint First Session held on 7 February 2011, it was originally agreed that a hearing on liability and *quantum* was to be held in Washington, D.C. from 28 May to 1 June 2012, with 2 June 2012 in reserve.\n\n68.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Professor Mutharika, the May/June 2012 hearing dates were vacated. On 27 October 2011, following the reconstitution of the Tribunal with Professor Chen filling the vacancy created by Professor Mutharika\u2019s resignation, the hearing on liability and *quantum* was rescheduled to take place in Singapore from 18 to 22 February 2013 (with 23 February 2013 in reserve).\n\n69.\n\nAs indicated above, these second hearing dates were vacated by the Tribunal in PO No. 3. New hearing dates, also fora hearing in Singapore, were scheduled for 10 to 14 June 2013 (with June 15, 2013 in reserve).\n\n70.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Professor Chen, the June 2013 hearing dates were also vacated. During a telephone conference of the President of the Tribunal with the Parties on 21 May 2013, new hearing dates were tentatively agreed, subject to the availability of the Respondent\u2019s new party-appointed arbitrator, for 28 October to 1 November 2013 in Washington, D.C. (with 2 November 2013 in reserve). The tentative hearing dates and new hearing venue were confirmed following the reconstitution of the two Tribunals with the addition of Mr. Hwang.\n\n71.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, liability and *quantum* was held at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C. from 28 October to 2 November 2013 (the **\"Hearing\").**\n\n72.\n\nThe following persons attended the Hearing on behalf of the Claimants:\n\nMr. Heinrich von Pezold\n\nMr. Bernhard (R\u00fcdiger) von Pezold\n\nMrs. Elisabeth von Pezold\n\nMr. Matthew Coleman, Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMr. Kevin Williams, Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMr. Anthony Rapa, Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMs. Helen Aldridge, Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMr. Charles Verrill, Jr., Wiley Rein\n\nMr. Thomas Innes, Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMs. June Booth, Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMr. Kenneth Schofield, Border Timbers Limited\n\nMr. Gideon Theron, Commercial Farmers\u2019 Union\n\nMr. Simon van derLingen, Border Timbers Limited\n\nMr. George Bottger, Border Timbers Limited\n\nMr. Anthony Levitt, RGL Forensics\n\nMr. Richard Jenks, RGL Forensics\n\nMs. Helen Swain, RGL Forensics\n\nProfessor Stephen Chan, SOAS University\n\nMr. Alan Stephenson, Mills Fitchett\n\nMr. Paul Christopher Paul, Wintertons\n\nMs. Amanda von Pezold\n\nMs. Elba Schofield\n\nAttending on behalf of the Respondent were:\n\nThe Honourable Douglas T.

Day 4, pp. 1168-1257] and Minister Didymus Mutasa [Tr. Day 5, pp. 1332-1417],\n\n74.\n\nThe following expert witnesses were called to testify during the Hearing: for the Claimants - Mr. Paul Paul [Tr. Day 3, pp. 830-902]; Professor Stephen Chan [Tr. Day 3, pp. 902-970]; Mr. Alan Stephenson [Tr. Day 4, pp. 986-1057]; Mr. Anthony Levitt [Tr. Day 4, pp. 1057-1163]; for the Respondent - Mr. Onias Masiiwa [Tr.

Day 6, pp. 1687-1871],\n\n75.\n\nMr. Guy Lafferty, Mr. Juerg Kaempfer, Mr. John Gadzikwa, Mr. Alex Masterson, Mrs. Anna Webber, Mrs. Maria Batthy\u00e4ny, Mr. Georg von Pezold, Mr. Felix von Pezold, Mr. Johann von Pezold, Mr. Adam von Pezold, Mr. Henrik Olivier, Mr. Duncan Hamilton, Mr. Adrian de Bourbon, Dr. Albrecht Conze and Mr. Nicholas Shaxson submitted fact written evidence and Mr. Charles Laurie, Mr. Arthur Daugherty, Mr. John Robertson, Mr. Jason Ridley, Professor Dan Sarooshi submitted expert reports in support of the Claimants\u2019 case, but were not called to testify at the Hearing. Similarly, Mr. Nixon Kutsaranga, Mr. Upenyu Mavatu, Mr. Richard Patrick Chitondwe, Mr. Lovemore Makunun\u2019unu, Mr. Maxwell Chasakwa, Mr. Rodwell Muzite and Chief Chadworth Ringisai Chikukwa submitted fact written evidence in support of the Respondent\u2019s case but were not called to testify orally.\n\n76.\n\nOn 30 October 2013, counsel for the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Minister Didymus Mutasa, whose presence at the Hearing had been requested by the Claimants, was unable to attend the Hearing in-person due to delays in the issuance of a travel visa by the United States Government. Accordingly, arrangements were made for Minister Mutasa to be examined by video-conference from the World Bank\u2019s office in Harare, in the presence of Ms. Joy Berry, staff member at ICSID, and a representative of each Party (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 981-983).\n\n(3) The Post-Hearing Procedure\n------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nOn 22 November 2013, the Claimants filed their proposed corrections to the Hearing transcript and identified those portions of the transcript which they submitted contain inadmissible evidence and/or submissions. As the Respondent requested, and was granted, an extension of time to file its proposed corrections to the Hearing transcript, the Claimants\u2019 proposed corrections and excisions relating to inadmissible evidence and/or submissions were transmitted to the Tribunal and the Respondent on 29 November 2013, following the Respondent\u2019s filing of its proposed corrections.\n\n78.\n\nOn 29 November 2013, the Respondent filed its proposed corrections to the transcript, along with responses to questions raised by the Tribunal during the Hearing, supported by those documents that the Respondent had undertaken to provide following the Hearing relating to Zimbabwean land audits and the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the German BIT.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter of 2 December 2013, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and seek to agree corrections to the transcript that were editorial in nature, advising the Tribunal of any such agreement by 16 December 2013. The Tribunal also invited the Claimants to file any observations they had on the Respondent\u2019s answers to the Tribunal\u2019s questions, which had been posed during the Hearing, regarding land audits and the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the German BIT by 23 December 2013. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to file a reply to the Claimants\u2019 observations by 6 January 2014; however, the Respondent elected not to file such reply.\n\n80.\n\nAll of the aforementioned post-hearing matters, among others, were resolved by PO No. 10.\n\n81.\n\nOn 7 May 2014, the Parties filed post-hearing briefs with the Tribunal19. Inaccordance with PO No. 10, the Claimants filed, on 6 June 2014, their statement regarding material contained in the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief which they considered inadmissible.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent\u2019s request, in its Post-Hearing Brief, to re-open PO No. 9 in Section VI.F (2) below.\n\n82.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Tribunal requested detailed costs submissions, which were duly filed by the Parties on 1 December 2014. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to file a simultaneous round of reply submissions on costs, by 18 December 2014, which were also duly filed.\n\n83.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in both the von Pezold and the Border arbitrations.\n\n84.\n\nOn 2 June 2015, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that it would be unable to draw up and sign the Award(s) by 3 June 2015, being 120 days after closure of the proceedings. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 46 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal then extended this period by a further 60 days and so notified the Parties.\n\n**F. The BITS**\n---------------\n\n85.\n\nThe treaties under which the Claimants advance their claims are the German BIT, signed on 29 September 1995, and which entered into force on 14 April 200020, together with the Protocol to the German BIT which was signed on 29 September 1995 (the **\"German Protocol\"),** and the Swiss BIT, signed on 15 August 1996, and which entered into force on 9 February 2001, together with the Protocol to the Swiss BIT which was signed on 15 August 1996.\n\nThis description is without prejudice to the Claimants\u2019 submission that the German BIT provisionally applied by agreement of the BIT Contracting Parties as from 18 September 1996. See above Section VI.E.\n\n86.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 arbitration agreements are contained in the respective BITs. Article 11 of the German BIT provides as follows in connection with the settlement of disputes arising under the treaty between a Contracting State and an investor of a Contracting State:\n\n**Settlement of Investment Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the Other Contracting Party**\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of such national or company in the territory of the former Contracting Party shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If the dispute is not settled within six months of the date when it is raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the national or company concerned, be submitted for arbitration. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit the dispute to arbitration. Unless the parties indispute agree otherwise, the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 18th March, 1965. The arbitral tribunal constituted pursuant to the said Convention shall reach its decisions on the basis of this Agreement, any treaties in force between the Contracting Parties, such rules of general international law as may be applicable, and the domestic law of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the Investment inquestion is situated.\n\n(3) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or remedy other than that provided for in the said Convention. The award shall be enforced in accordance with the domestic law of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment in question is situated.\n\n(4) During arbitration proceedings or proceedings for the enforcement of an award, the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the objection that the national or company concerned has received compensation under an Insurance contract in respect of all or part of his or its damage or losses.\n\n87.\n\nArticle 10 of the Swiss BIT provides as follows in connection with the settlement of disputes arising under the treaty between a Contracting State and an investor of a Contracting State:\n\n**Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party**\n\n(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without prejudice to Article 11 of this Agreement (Disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months and if the investor concerned gives written consent, the dispute shall be submitted to the arbitration of the international Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes instituted by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, for the settlement of disputes regarding Investments between States and nationals of other States.\n\nEach party may start the procedure by addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre as foreseen by Article 28 and 36 of the above-mentioned Convention. Should the parties disagree on whether conciliation or arbitration is the most appropriate procedure, the investor concerned shall have the final decision.\n\n(3) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the present Agreement and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties; the terms of any particular agreement that has been concluded with respect to the Investment; the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, including its rules on the conflict of laws; such rules of International law as may be applicable.\n\n(4) The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not at any time during the procedures assert as a defence its Immunity or the fact that the investor has received compensation under an Insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage or loss.\n\n(5) Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels a dispute submitted to the arbitration of the Centre unless the other Contracting Party does not abide by and comply with the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal.\n\n(6) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the parties involved in the dispute and shall be enforceable inaccordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in which the Investment inquestion is located.\n\n**G. The Parties\u2019 Respective Prayers for Relief**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants seek declaratory relief and restitution plus compensation, or compensation alone, for the alleged violations by the Respondent of the terms of the German and Swiss BITs21.

Background**\n-------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThis Tribunal sets out below a brief summary of the factual basis for its decisions in the present Award. Where disputed by the Parties, the Tribunal has established these facts primarily from the contemporaneous documentation adduced in evidence by the Parties, supplemented by the testimony of their factual and expert witnesses (both oral and written) as provided to the Tribunal in this arbitration. This summary does not purport exclusively to cover all relevant facts relied on by the Tribunal in reaching its decision.\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n92.\n\nThis case is, at its heart, a land dispute, but one with deep context and history. The \"land question\" in Zimbabwe, formerly Southern Rhodesia **(\"Rhodesia\"),** began in the late 1800s with the arrival of Cecil John Rhodes on the area controlled at the time by King Lobengula. During the period of colonial rule, land in Rhodesia was subdivided into white areas, or white commercial farms, and tribal trust lands where those native to the land were forced to live.\n\n93.\n\nThe result of Rhodesian-era land policies and colonial oppression was nothing short of devastating on the indigenous population and gave way to a violent and persistent struggle for \"liberation\", expressed as follows by Minister Didiymus Mutasa, a witness in these proceedings for the Respondent (see Mutasa I, para. 15):\n\n... [O]ur existence in our own country, on our own land in the days before liberation, was a very sad existence indeed. Our land was taken away, our friends, who were talking about farms, are talking about farms which didn't come from heaven for them, but farms which they expropriated from our forefathers, from our ancestors, many not so long ago, where many of us were already living. They did not expect us to sit back and smile and enjoy what they were doing, and indeed, we did not sit back and enjoy. We had to mount a liberation struggle, and I am happy to say that I am one of those who participated in the liberation struggle.\n\n94.\n\nThis \"liberation struggle\" led to the Lancaster House Conference in 1979, and the birth of a new Independent State - the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\n95.\n\nThe Lancaster House Agreement established Zimbabwe\u2019s first Constitution, which provided for, among other things, robust private property rights. The newly formed Government of Zimbabwe, ultimately led by President Robert Mugabe following his election as President in February 1980, committed to suspend the institution of land reform for 10 years following Zimbabwe\u2019s independence.\n\n96.\n\nAs at 1980, 15.5 million hectares **(\"ha\")** of Zimbabwe\u2019s total area (i.e., 39.6 million ha) were dedicated to large scale commercial farming. Title to this land was held by approximately 6,000 white farmers. 6.4 million ha were comprised of Communal Land, largely devoted to subsistence farming by the indigenous population, and the remaining land was divided between small scale commercial operations, national parks, State land and urban settlements.\n\n**B. The Land Reform Programme**\n--------------------------------\n\n(1) The First Phase\n-------------------\n\n97.\n\nDuring Phase I of the LRP, the Government of Zimbabwe aimed to acquire on a \"willing buyer-willing seller\" basis 8.3 million ha of agricultural land from large-scale farms in order to resettle 162,000 families. Little progress was made toward this goal during the first 10 years of independence.\n\n98.\n\nThe Government enacted the *Land Acquisition Act* in 1992, which gave the Government the power to acquire land and other immovable property compulsorily for certain purposes, including the acquisition of agricultural land for resettlement purposes. Accordingly, this ended the period of time during which agricultural land could only be acquired by the State on a willing buyer - willing seller basis.\n\n99.\n\nThe *Land Acquisition Act* provided for notice to be given of the proposed acquisition (a **\"Section 5 Notice\")** and a process whereby the acquisition could be challenged. If a Section 5 Notice was challenged, the Government was required to make an application to the appropriate municipal court, seeking either authorization to issue a Section 8 Order, which would vest title in the land to the State, or confirmation of a Section 8 Order if one had already been issued.\n\n100.\n\nThe *Land Acquisition Act* established that \"fair compensation\" must be paid for any land acquired for resettlement purposes \"within a reasonable time\".\n\n101.\n\nThe Constitution was amended in 1996 to confirm that protection continued for the property rights of foreign nationals under international investment treaties despite the LRP. Specifically, Section 16(9b) provided as follows:\n\n(9b) Nothing in this section shall affect or derogate from\u2014\n\n(a) any obligation assumed by the State; or\n\n(b) any right or Interest conferred upon any person;\n\nin relation to the protection of property and the payment and determination of compensation inrespect of the acquisition of property. Interms of any convention, treaty or agreement acceded to, concluded or executed by or under the authority of the President with one or more foreign states or governments or International organisations.\n\n[Subsection inserted by section 7 of Act No. 14 of 1996 - Amendment No. 14]\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n102.\n\nBy 1997, however, the Government had only acquired 3.5 million ha and had only resettled 71,000 families.\n\n(2) The Second Phase\n--------------------\n\n103.\n\nIn 1998, the Government hosted a land donor conference, during which the issue of compensation for land reform for resettlement was discussed, with a view to securing a stronger commitment from the International community to support Zimbabwe\u2019s land reform efforts. The timing of the conference coincided with Zimbabwe\u2019s shift Into Phase II of the LRP, in which It Intended to accelerate the pace of land acquisition for resettlement.\n\n104.\n\nPhase II was itself composed of several phases, including an \"Inception Phase\" during which the Government stated its Intention to acquire an additional 2.1 million ha of agricultural land beyond the original planned 8.3 million ha. The pace of land acquisition during this phase continued, however, to be slow, inpart due to a lack of funds to compensate land owners for land acquired from them.\n\n105.\n\nThe slow pace of land reform, two decades after Independence, led to mounting frustration among those Zimbabweans who had fought for Independence. The Government responded by adopting measures to further accelerate land reform and resettlement.\n\n106.\n\nIn February 2000, a new draft Constitution was put in a referendum to the people of Zimbabwe, which would have permitted the Government to compulsorily acquire land without compensation. The draft Constitution was rejected. The timing of the referendum on the Constitution coincided with the emergence of a new political party in Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change (\"MDC\"), formed by a broad coalition of civil society groups inopposition to President Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front **(\"ZANU-PF\")** party. Following the rejection of the draft Constitution, the first \"Invasions\" of white-owned farms began in Masvlngo Province, near the capital of Harare, and gradually spread across the country (see below Section IV.C.).\n\n107.\n\nThe Government subsequently launched, on 15 July 2000, the Fast Track Land Reform Programme **(\"FTLRP\").** Another shift in land acquisition principles occurred as part of this phase of land reform. The Constitution was amended through the enactment of Section 16A, which changed the compensation regime for the acquisition of land, permitting the Government to compensate landowners only for \"improvements\" to agricultural land, as opposed to the land itself. Section 16A provided as follows:\n\n16A Agricultural land acquired for resettlement\n\n(1) In regard to the compulsory acquisition of agricultural land for the resettlement of people inaccordance with a programme of land reform, the following factors shall be regarded as of ultimate and overriding Importance -\n\n(a) under colonial domination the people of Zimbabwe were unjustifiably dispossessed of their land and other resources without compensation;\n\n(b) the people consequently took up arms in order to regain their land and political sovereignty, and this ultimately resulted in the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980;\n\n(c) the people of Zimbabwe must be enabled to reassert their rights and regain ownership of their land;\n\nand accordingly\u2014\n\n(i) the former colonial power has an obligation to pay compensation for agricultural land compulsorily acquired for resettlement, through an adequate fund established for the purpose : and\n\n(ii) If the former colonial power falls to pay compensation through such a fund, the Government of Zimbabwe has no obligation to pay compensation for agricultural land compulsorily acquired for resettlement.\n\n(2) In view of the overriding considerations set out insubsection (1), where agricultural land is acquired compulsorily for the resettlement of people in accordance with a programme of land reform, the following factors shall be taken into account in the assessment of any compensation that may be payable \u2014\n\n(a) the history of the ownership, use and occupation of the land;\n\n(b) the price paid for the land when it was last acquired;\n\n(c) the cost or value of improvements on the land :\n\n(d) the current use to which the land and any improvements on it are being put;\n\n(e) any investment which the State or the acquiring authority may have made which Improved or enhanced the value of the land and any improvements on it;\n\n(f) the resources available to the acquiring authority in Implementing the programme of land reform;\n\n(g) any financial constraints that necessitate the payment of compensation in instalments over a period of time; and\n\n(h) any other relevant factor that may be specified in an Act of Parliament.\n\n[Section inserted by section 3 of Act 5 of 2000 - Amendment No. 16] [emphasis added]\n\n108.\n\nThrough Section 16A the burden of compensating land owners for the acquisition of their land was also shifted by the Government onto the \"former colonial power\" (i.e., Great Britain) and Zimbabwe absolved itself under Zimbabwean law of any duty to compensate landowners for the value of agricultural land acquired for resettlement purposes, save for \"improvements\".\n\n109.\n\nThe *Land Acquisition Act* was amended accordingly to remove compensation for agricultural land acquired compulsorily by the State.\n\n**C. The Invasions**\n--------------------\n\n110.\n\nAs noted above, the \"Invasions\" of predominantly white-owned farms also marked the beginning of the FTLRP. The Tribunal has considered the various accounts of these \"Invasions\" presented by the Parties. The Tribunal considers the evidence given by Professor Stephen Chan on the Invasions to be Instructive and helpful, particularly as it was not challenged by the Respondent on cross-examination.\n\n111.\n\nProfessor Chan is a Professor of International Relations and Dean of Law and Social Sciences at the School of Oriental & African Studies at the University of London, and Eminent Scholar in Global Development 2010, of the International Studies Association. Beyond academia, Professor Chan\u2019s career Includes work for government and International organizations, with a special focus on Africa, including the Republic of Zimbabwe. In the 1970s, Professor Chan was a civil servant with the Commonwealth Secretariat and served as an observer of the 1979 negotiations leading to Zimbabwe\u2019s Independence. From January to March 1980, Professor Chan conducted the reconnaissance for, and helped anchor, the Commonwealth Observer Group charged with the validation of the electoral process leading to Zimbabwe\u2019s Independence. Professor Chan resided in Africa from 1980 to 1985, and has, for the past 35 years, visited Zimbabwe nearly every year to talk with politicians, civil servants, military personnel and other Influential persons to obtain firsthand knowledge of the political, social and economic developments in-Zimbabwe. His credentials are Impressive and, in addition to being a well-qualified expert, he is able to speak, to some extent, from first-hand experience on the matters at hand.\n\n112.\n\nFrom Professor Chan\u2019s evidence, as corroborated and supplemented by other accounts on the record, the Tribunal finds the following facts to have been established on the evidence:\n\n(a) the Invasions of predominantly white-owned commercial farms began in the Province of Masvlngo on 16 February 2000, and quickly spread to other parts of Zimbabwe;\n\n(b) the Invasions were a response to political events, such as the failed draft Constitution proposed by the Mugabe Government in February 2000, and the slow pace of land reform;\n\n(c) the Invasions were not anticipated and, at the beginning, were disorganized and \"inchoate\", by which the Tribunal understands that the Invasions at this stage were incipient;\n\n(d) the Invasions were accompanied by a racial rhetoric that was overwhelmingly anti-white;\n\n(e) as the Invasions continued and expanded across Zimbabwe, logistical support and supplies appear to have been provided by organs of the Zimbabwean Government to persons coming onto private land (i.e., the \"Settlers/War Veterans\").\n\n113.\n\nSeveral judgments by the Zimbabwean courts also record that, during 2000, the police took little or no action inrespect of the acts of the Invaders, despite multiple court orders declaring the Invasions to be unlawful and directing the police to ensure that the Invaders vacated the farms. Moreover, ZANU-PF officials, public servants, the CIO and the Army were found to have actively supported, encouraged, transported and financed the Settlers/War Veterans. In *CFU v. Minister of Lands & Ors,* 2000 (2) ZLR 469(5), the Zimbabwean High Court held that, as a result of the Invasions, farmers and their employees had been denied protection of the law under s. 18 of the Constitution22 and discriminated against on the basis of affiliation with or support for an opposition political party *(i.e.,* the MDC). The Court summarized the Invasions in early 2000 as follows (see\u00a0*CFU v. Minister of Lands & Ors,* 2000 (2) ZLR 469(5), p. 477, CLEX-76):\n\nIn February 2000, a referendum was held on a proposed new Constitution for Zimbabwe. The defeat of that proposal was followed \"within a matter of days by the beginning of a series of land Invasions. Although these began as a supposedly peaceful demonstration they quickly gathered such momentum that it became obvious that the exercise was actually being driven by or had been taken over by Government\" (Hasluck).\n\nThe story of these demonstratlons/invasions is set out ingraphic detail in the CFU\u2019s papers, more particularly in Mr Hasluck\u2019s affidavits. Murders (in the early stages), serious assaults, trespass, arson, stock-theft, poaching and malicious Injury to property became rife throughout the commercial farming areas. The reaction of the police was either nil or negligible, with Isolated exceptions. War veterans, landless peasant farmers and unemployed youths moved onto farms, ferried insome cases in Government vehicles, encouraged by party politicians. Some were aggressive, forcing the farmers to flee, burning down workers\u2019 houses, forbidding the reaping or planting of crops. Others cut fences and cut down trees to make temporary shelters. Others again were more passive, simply making temporary shelters for themselves and leaving when the subsidy they were given ran out. The situation throughout the commercial farming areas remained, and remains, tense and volatile. The harassment continues and inmany cases has Intensified.\n\nSection 18 of the 2005 2005 Zimbabwean Constitution provides that \"every person is entitled to protection of the law\", (see CLEX-019).\n\n114.\n\nAs regards the Claimants\u2019 Estates (described below) in particular, Mr. Heinrich von Pezold\u2019s evidence confirms the passive role of the police inaddressing the Settlers\u2019/War Veterans\u2019 activity and the active Involvement of government officials and agents insupporting and providing resources for Invaders on the Estates (see Heinrich I, paras. 575-586).\n\n115.\n\nAll three of the Claimants\u2019 Estates have been Invaded and Settlers/War Veterans who Invaded the Estates remain inoccupation of certain portions of the Estates.\n\n**D. The 2005 Constitutional Amendment**\n----------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Constitution was again amended In 2005 (the **\"2005 Constitutional Amendment\")** by enacting Section 16B, which provided, inrelevant part, as follows:\n\n16B Agricultural land acquired for resettlement and other purposes\n\n(1) in this section -\n\n(a) all agricultural land \u2014\n\n(i) that was Identified on or before the 8th July, 2005, in the Gazette or Gazette Extraordinary under section 5(1) of the Land Acquisition Act [Chapter 20:101, and which is Itemised in Schedule 7, being agricultural land required for resettlement purposes : or\n\n(ii) that is Identified after the 8th July, 2005, but before the appointed day,\n\nin the Gazette or Gazette Extraordinary under section 5(1) of the Land Acquisition Act [Chapter 20:10], being agricultural land required for resettlement purposes; or\n\n(iii) that is Identified interms of this section by the acquiring authority after the appointed day in the Gazette or Gazette Extraordinary for whatever purpose, including, but not limited to \u2014\n\nA. settlement for agricultural or other purposes; or\n\nB. the purposes of land reorganisation, forestry, environmental conservation or the utilisation of wild life or other natural resources; or\n\nC. the relocation of persons dispossessed inconsequence of the utilisation of land for a purpose referred to insubparagraph A or B;\n\nis acquired by and vested in the State with full title therein with effect from the appointed day or, in the case of land referred to insubparagraph (iii), with effect from the date it is Identified in the manner specified in that paragraph; and\n\n(b) no compensation shall be payable for land referred to inparagraph (a) except for any improvements effected on such land before it was acquired.\n\n(3) The provisions of any law referred to insection 16(1) regulating the compulsory acquisition of land that is inforce on the appointed day, and the provisions of section 18(1) and (9), shall not apply in relation to land referred to insubsection (2)(a) except for the purpose of determining any question related to the payment of compensation referred to insubsection (2)(b), that is to say, a person having any right or Interest in the land -\n\n(a) shall not apply to a court to challenge the acquisition of the land by the State, and no court shall entertain any such challenge :\n\n(b) may, inaccordance with the provisions of any law referred to insection 16(1) regulating the compulsory acquisition of land that is inforce on the appointed day, challenge the amount of compensation payable for any improvements effected on the land before it was acquired.\n\n(4) As soon as practicable after the appointed day, or after the date when the land is Identified in the manner specified insubsection (2)(a)(lll), as the case may be, the person responsible under any law providing for the registration of title over land shall, without further notice, effect the necessary endorsements upon any title deed and entries in any register kept interms of that law for the purpose of formally cancelling the title deed and registering in the State title over the land.\n\n(5) Any Inconsistency between anything contained in-\n\n(a) a noticed itemised in Schedule 7; or\n\n(b) a notice relating to land referred to insubsection (2)(a)(ii) or (iii);\n\nand the title deed to which It refers or is Intended to refer, and any error whatsoever contained insuch notice, shall not affect the operation of subsection (2)(a) or Invalidate the vesting of title in the State interms of that provision.\n\n(6) An Act of Parliament may make it a criminal offence for any person, without lawful authority, to possess or occupy land referred to in this section or other State land.\n\n(7) This section applies without prejudice to the obligation of the former colonial power to pay compensation for land referred to in this section that was acquired for resettlement purposes.\n\n[Section inserted by section 2 of Act 5 of 2005 - Amendment No. 17.] [emphasis added]\n\n117.\n\nThe effect of Section 16B was to acquire and vest in the State title to every property in Zimbabwe in relation to which a Section 5 Notice had been issued on or before 8 July 2005, if the Notice was identified in Schedule 7 of the amended Constitution. The right that had previously existed to challenge the acquisition of land was removed. Section 16B(6) also criminalized the continued possession or occupation of land expropriated pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment.\n\n**E. The Claimants\u2019 Interests in Zimbabwe**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe measures allegedly taken by the Respondent against the von Pezold Claimants relate to three large properties located in Zimbabwe, namely the Forrester Estate, the Border Estate and the Makandi Estate (the **\"Estates\").** The measures allegedly taken by the Respondent against the Border Claimants relate exclusively to the Border Estate.\n\n(1) The Forrester Estate\n------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Forrester Estate is essentially a tobacco growing and curing operation set on 22,000 ha of land and spread across ten properties located in the Province of Mashonaland Central in the North of Zimbabwe (the **\"Forrester Properties\")23.** It is the biggest tobacco operation of its kind in Zimbabwe, if not southern Africa, and, according to the Claimants, has a long record of success. in addition to tobacco, the Forrester Estate has 3,325 head of cattle, citrus, row crops (maize, wheat, barley, sorghum and soya beans), and peas.\n\nA list of the ten Forrester Properties is provided in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 1. This table is reproduced as Annex B to the Operative Part of the present Award.\n\n120.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants, through a combination of direct and Indirect holdings, own 100% of the issued share capital of the local companies within the Forrester Estate. These companies are: Forrester Holdings (Private) Limited; Forrester Estate (Private) Limited (which is the operating company); and Forrester Silk (Private) Limited (collectively **\"the Forrester Companies\").** Further, the von Pezold Parent Claimants own 100% of the issued share capital of the local company, Northern Tobacco (Private) Limited, which buys all of the tobacco of the Forrester Estate and some other tobacco growers.\n\n121.\n\nIn 1988, the Parent Claimants acquired 99% of Forrester Estate (Private) Ltd. which, at the time, owned nine of the ten Forrester Properties. The Parent Claimants acquired the remaining 1% in 1998.\n\n122.\n\nIn 1991, the Parent Claimants acquired 100% of Forrester Silk (Private) Ltd. which, in 1996, directly acquired the last of the ten Forrester Properties.\n\n123.\n\nIn 1997, the Parent Claimants acquired 22.22% of the class \"B\" shares of Forrester Estate (Private) Ltd. Also in 1997, the Adult Children Claimants acquired 66% of the class \"B\" shares of Forrester Estate (Private) Ltd. and Adam von Pezold acquired 11.11% of the class \"B\" shares of Forrester Estate (Private) Ltd.\n\n124.\n\nFinally, In 2004, the Parent Claimants acquired 100% of Northern Tobacco (Private) Limited.\n\n125.\n\nThe Parent Claimants\u2019 Interest in the Forrester Estate is, today, held through a trust - the \"Habakuk\" trust - of which the Parent Claimants are the sole beneficiaries. The Tribunal has considered the chain of ownership and sequence of acquisition of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 interest in the Forrester Estate and is satisfied as to their claimed ownership of the Estate.\n\n(2) The Border Estate\n---------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Border Estate is an integrated forestry plantation comprising 28 properties with pine and eucalyptus (gum) plantations (referred to as the **\"Border Properties\")24** and three sawmills set on 47,886 ha of land and located in the Province of Manicaland in the East of Zimbabwe. In addition, the Border Estate includes two non-plantation properties comprising a pole treatment plant and two factories25, located on the outskirts of the town of Mutare, which is also in the Province of Manicaland.\n\nThe 28 Border Properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 6, which was corrected by the Claimants in their Reply, para. 396 and Annex 2. This table is reproduced as Annex A to the Operative Part of the present Award.\n\nThe related properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 6, properties Nos 21 and 22, as corrected in the Claimants\u2019 Reply, para. 396, and Annex 2 (See Annex A to the Operative Part of the present Award).\n\n127.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants (save for Adam) indirectly own 86.49% of the issued share capital of the local companies within the Border Estate26. These companies are the Border Claimants, namely Border, Border International (both of which are operating companies) and Hangani. Border owns all of the issued share capital of Border International and Hangani.\n\nThe Parent Claimants own 76.26% of Border.\n\n128.\n\nIn 1992, the Parent Claimants acquired 25.65% of Border, which directly and indirectly owns all of the Border Properties and factories within the Border Estate.\n\n129.\n\nIn 2000, the Parent Claimants acquired an additional 10.33% of Border. In this same year, the Adult Children Claimants acquired 10% of Border. Between 2001 and 2002, the Parent Claimants acquired a further 2.39% of Border, and in 2003, a further 37.57% of Border.\n\n130.\n\nIn 2004, the Parent Claimants acquired an additional 0,048% of Border, while Heinrich von Pezold acquired 0.23% of Border.\n\n131.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, the Parent Claimants again increased their interest in Border by 0.15% and 0.13% respectively for each year.\n\n132.\n\nThe Parent Claimants acquired their interest in the Border Estate indirectly through eight separate corporate vehicles or \"purchasing structures\". Most of the acquisitions were effected through nominee companies of the Habakuk Trust (Roanne (Nominees) Ltd. and Roanne Securities Ltd.).\n\n133.\n\nThe Adult Children Claimants also acquired their interest in the Border Estate indirectly through Kingdom Nominees (Private) Limited, which ceased to function by 2010 and, (for the purpose of holding intrust approximately half of the shares acquired in Border in 2000) was replaced by Roanne (Nominees) Limited.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the complex chain of ownership and sequence of acquisition of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 (save for Adam) and Border Claimants\u2019 Interest in the Border Estate and is satisfied as to the claimed ownership of both sets of Claimants over the Estate.\n\n(3) The Makandi Estate\n----------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Makandi Estate is a mixed plantation, growing coffee, bananas, maize, macadamla nuts, avocados, and timber for the production of transmission poles, set on 8,389 ha and spread across nine properties (\"the **Makandi Properties**\")**27** located in the Province of Manlcaland in the East of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe nine Makhandi Properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 10. This table is reproduced as Annex C to the Operative Part of the present Award.\n\n136.\n\nThe Parent Claimants, through a joint venture, - subject to one exception28 - Indirectly own 50% of the issued share capital of the local companies within the Makandi Estate, which are: Makandi Tea and Coffee Estates (Private) Limited; Large Scale Investments (Private) Limited; Chipinge Holdings (Private) Limited; Coffee Estates (Private) Limited; and Rusitu Valley Development Company (Private) Limited (of which they own 44.4%) (\"the **Makandi Companies\").**\n\nThe Parent Claimants own 50% of 88.8% of Rusitu Valley Development Company (Private) Limited.\n\n137.\n\nIn July 2005, the Parent Claimants acquired a 40% stake in the Makandi Companies, save for Rusitu Valley Development Company (Private) Ltd., of which they acquired 35.52%.\n\n138.\n\nBetween January and May 2006, the Parent Claimants Increased their shareholding in the Makandi Estate to 50%, save for Rusitu Valley Development Company (Private) Ltd., in which they Increased their Interest to 44.4%. The Parent Claimants acquired their 50% Interest in the Makandi Tea and Coffee Estates (Private) Ltd. through a joint venture that they entered Into with the H0egh Family, a Norwegian family, which held the Parent Claimants\u2019 Interest for them beneficially. As part of the joint venture, certain assets jointly owned were consolidated Into Rift Valley Holdings Ltd., a Mauritius holding company which is Indirectly owned 50/50 by the Parent Claimants and the H0eghs.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the chain of ownership and sequence of acquisition of the Parent Claimants\u2019 Interest in the Makandi Estate and is satisfied as to their claimed ownership of the Estate.\n\n**F. Zimbabwe\u2019s Acquisition of the Claimants\u2019 Estates**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Border Estate\n-----------------\n\n140.\n\nSection 5 Notices were issued pursuanttothe *Land Acquisition Act* in respect of 21 of the 28 Border Properties. Section 8 Orders were also issued in relation to a number of the Border Properties, all of which were either withdrawn by the Respondent or annulled by the local courts.\n\n141.\n\nOn 14 September 2005, 21 of the 28 Border Properties29 were acquired by the Respondent pursuant to the Constitutional Amendment, because they were subject to at least one Section 5 Notice that was identified in Schedule 7 of the Constitution.\n\nThese 21 properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 6, as corrected in the Claimants\u2019 Reply, and are those 21 Border Properties which are not marked with an asterisk, i.e. Farm Tilbury, Welgelegen, Imbeza Estate, Penhalonga Tree Plot, Tunnes Rus, Tyrconnel East of Tyrconnel, Imbeza Valley Lot 8, Remainder of Nyaronga Manor, Remainder of Sheba, Remainder of Walmer, Mahugara of Epsom, Remainder of Epsom, Cambridge Estate, Glacier of Weltevreden, Groenkop Extension, Middelpunt of Jantia, Remaining Extent of Sawerombi, Sawerombi West of Sawerombi, Verlos of Weltevreden, Welgegund Estate, and Weltevreden Estate (see Annex A to the Operative Part of the present Award).\n\n142.\n\nThe remaining seven properties, including the Sheba sawmill30, and the two non-plantation properties with the two factories and the pole treatment plant31, although not compulsorily acquired under the Constitution, are, however, said to be worthless now because they are not viable on their own32.\n\nThese seven properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 6, as corrected in the Claimants\u2019 Reply, and are those seven Border Properties which are marked with an asterisk, namely: Subdivision B Portion of Epsom (Sheba), Pioneer Farm (Sheba), Farm Lambton (Sheba), Harris Ville (Sheba), Stand 45 Penhalonga Township (Imbeza), Greater Zingeni (Imbeza) and Farm Dunstan (Tilbury). See also the Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial, para. 219, footnote 402 (see Annex A to the Operative Part of the present Award).\n\nThese two properties are identified as properties Nos. 21 and 22 in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 6, as corrected in the Claimants\u2019 Reply (See Annex A to the Operative Part of the present Award).\n\nIt should be noted that properties Nos. 21 and 22 in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 6, as corrected in the Claimants\u2019 Reply, are not marked with an asterisk, which seems to suggest that these properties were directly affected by the Constitutional Amendment (see Annex A to the Operative Part of the present Award). However, given the Claimants\u2019 explanations in paras. 481 and 850 of their Memorial, the Tribunal is satisfied that these two properties were indeed not directly affected by the Constitutional Amendment but are said to be worthless as they are not viable on their own. See Claimants\u2019 Memorial, paras. 481 and 850.\n\n143.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants\u2019 (save for Adam) share capital in the Border Claimants is now also said to be worthless because the assets of the Border Companies, namely the Border Properties, have nearly all been acquired and the balance rendered worthless by the 2005 Constitutional Amendment.\n\n144.\n\nFor the same reason, the share capital owned by Border in each of Border International and Hangani is said to be worthless.\n\n145.\n\nIt is clear that no compensation was paid by the Government for these compulsory acquisitions.\n\n(2) Makandi Estate\n------------------\n\n146.\n\nPrior to the Parent Claimants acquiring an Interest in the Makandi Estate, Section 5 Notices were issued to seven of the nine Makandi Properties. All Section 8 Orders Issued against the Makandi Estate properties were either withdrawn by the Respondent or not confirmed by the courts.\n\n147.\n\nOn 14 September 2005, six of the nine Makandi Properties were acquired by the Government pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment, because they were all subject to at least one Section 5 Notice that had been Identified in Schedule 7 of the Constitution33. Also said to have been acquired at this time are the Water Permits attaching to the Makandi Estate (see Table 3 of the Claimants\u2019 Reply).\n\nThese six properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 10 and are those six properties which are not marked with an asterisk, i.e., Smalldeel Estate, Lot 2A Chipinga, Subdivision A of Chipinga, Subdivision C of Chipinga, Lot 4 of Fortuna, and Rusitu (see Annex C to the Operative Part of the present Award).\n\n148.\n\nSimilar to the Border Estate, the remaining three properties34, although not compulsorily acquired under the Constitution, are said to be worthless now because they are not viable on their own.\n\nThese three properties are identified in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Table 10 and are those three properties which are marked with an asterisk, namely Christina Estate, Lot 3 of Clearwater Estate, and the Waterfall Estate (see Annex C to the Operative Part of the present Award). See also the Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial, para. 219, footnote 403.\n\n149.\n\nBy way of the 2005 Constitutional Amendment, the Respondent is also said to have compulsorily acquired the Parent Claimants\u2019 share acquisition rights (i.e., to acquire further shares in the Makandi Estate) (the **\"Makandi Acquisition Rights\")** for the reasons expressed above.\n\n150.\n\nFinally, the Parent Claimants\u2019 share capital in the Makandi Companies is now said to be worthless because the assets of the Makandi Companies, namely the Makandi Properties, have nearly all been compulsorily acquired and the balance rendered worthless by the 2005 Constitutional Amendment.\n\n151.\n\nIt is clear that no compensation was paid by the Government for these compulsory acquisitions.\n\n(3) Forrester Estate\n--------------------\n\n152.\n\nSection 5 Notices were issued pursuant to the *Land Acquisition Act* to all ten of the Forrester Properties. Section 8 Orders were also Issued in relation to a number of the Forrester Properties, all of which were either withdrawn by the Government or annulled by the local courts.\n\n153.\n\nOn 14 September 2005, all ten of the Forrester Properties were acquired by the Government pursuant to the Constitutional Amendment, because they were all subject to at least one Section 5 Notice that had been Identified in Schedule 7 of the Constitution. Also said to have been acquired at this time are the Water Permits attaching to the Forrester Estate (see **Table 1** of the Claimants\u2019 Reply).\n\n154.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants\u2019 share capital in the Forrester Companies is now said to be worthless because the assets of the Forrester Companies, namely the Forester Properties, have been compulsorily acquired.\n\n155.\n\nIt is clear that no compensation was paid by the Government for these compulsory acquisitions.\n\n156.\n\nOther assets from the Forrester Estate are also alleged to have been acquired by the Respondent, such as maize seized by the Grain Marketing Board in January 2002, for which the von Pezold Claimants say they were only partially compensated.\n\n(4) Summary\n-----------\n\n157.\n\nIn summary, as a result of the 2005 Constitutional Amendment, all ten of the Forrester Properties (see Table 1 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial), 21 of the 28 Border Properties, two of which contain a sawmill (see Table 6 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial corrected by the Claimants in their Reply) and six of the nine Makandi Properties (see Table 10 of the Claimants\u2019 Reply) were acquired by the Respondent. These properties are collectively referred to by the Tribunal as the **\"Zimbabwean Properties\".**\n\n158.\n\nIn addition, according to the Claimants, the remaining seven Border Properties, one of which contains the Sheba sawmill, and two further properties with the two pole factories and the pole treatment plant (see above para. 142 and Table 6 in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, as corrected) and the remaining three Makandi Properties (see above para. 148) are said to be worthless since they are not viable on their own. These properties are collectively referred to as the **\"Residual Properties\".**\n\n**G. The Claimants\u2019 Position Today**\n------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, all of the Estates continue to operate today as going concerns and are \"thriving\", although the Forrester and Border Estates continue to recover from the Invasions and the LRP, which the Claimants say has affected productivity. However, as the majority of properties on the three Estates were allegedly expropriated pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment, and the remaining properties and assets are said not to be viable on their own, the Claimants take the position that they have, ineffect, been reduced to \"mere licensees at the will of the Respondent\" (see Heinrich I, paras. 298, 470) and, as a result, are unable to receive any value for the Estates by way of a share or asset sale. These matters are discussed in detail below.\n\n**H. The State of Land Reform in Zimbabwe Today**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 400 white farmers remaining in-Zimbabwe today, farming 117,409 ha of land. This may be compared to the approximately 4,500 white farmers on 4,800 large scale commercial farms, covering 11.9 million ha of land, present in-Zimbabwe in 1999. Save for a few Instances, it is not really disputed by the Parties that the majority of land farmed by white farmers was compulsorily acquired without compensation pursuant to the LRP.\n\n161.\n\nIt is not disputed that farms acquired from white farm owners are now occupied by black farmers, senior members of the Zimbabwean Government and/or members of their families, ZANU-PF, the military and civil services. The Parties do, however, take different positions on the fairness of such land being allocated to Government officials and their families, the extent of such allocations, and the significance of this, if any, for the legality of the LRP.\n\n162.\n\nIn 2012, a new Constitution was put to the Zimbabwean people in a referendum, and subsequently enacted Into law inearly 2013 (the **\"2013 Constitution\")** (see CLEX-331; Tr. Day 4, pp. 1190-1191). On the matter of agricultural land, addressed in Chapter 16 of the 2013 Constitution, the principles relating to compensation for land acquired by the Respondent were again changed, this time to provide expressly for the full compensation of any \"Indigenous Zimbabwean\" whose agricultural land was acquired, incontradistinction to the compensation of non-indigenous Zimbabweans. The 2013 Constitution also reaffirmed that foreign nationals protected by a BIT whose agricultural land had been acquired are entitled to full compensation for that land pursuant to the terms of the BIT. Specifically, Chapter 16.8 of the draft 2013 Constitution35 provided as follows:\n\n**16.8 Compensation for acquisition of previously-acquired agricultural land**\n\n(1) Any indigenous Zimbabwean whose agricultural land was acquired by the State before the effective date is entitled to compensation from the State for the land and any improvements that were on the land when it was acquired.\n\n(2) Any persons whose agricultural land was acquired by the State before the effective date and whose property rights at that time were guaranteed or protected by an agreement concluded by the Government of Zimbabwe with the government of another country, is entitled to compensation from the State for the land and any improvements in accordance with that agreement.\n\n(3) Any person, other than a person referred to in subsection (1) or (2), whose agricultural land was acquired by the State before the effective date is entitled to compensation from the State only for improvements that were on the land when it was acquired.\n\nA copy of the final amended Constitution, enacted in 2013, was not placed on the record. The Tribunal understands, however, that the provision relating to compensation for the acquisition of previously-acquired agricultural land is not materially different from the draft on the record in the arbitration, CLEX-331.\n\n163.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Ms. Tsvakwi, a fact witness for the Respondent, confirmed that an \"indigenous Zimbabwean\" within the meaning of the 2013 Constitution is a black farmer or black Zimbabwean (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1191).\n\n**V Issues to be Determined**\n-----------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe issues before the Tribunal for determination may be grouped into 15 categories and are briefly summarized below.

The Tribunal has, where convenient, reproduced or summarized parts of those submissions in the body of the Award; however, it is not possible to Incorporate the entirety of the Parties\u2019 submissions, both written and oral, made in the course of these proceedings. The Tribunal has nonetheless considered the full submissions of the Parties in identifying the principal issues and in arriving at its decisions on those issues in this Award.\n\n**A. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n167.\n\nBefore turning to the specific issues identified above, the Tribunal wishes to address certain preliminary matters, including: (1) the law applicable to the merits of the present disputes; (2) the allocation of the burden of proof; and (3) the standard of proof.\n\n(1) Applicable Law\n------------------\n\n168.\n\nArticle 42 of the ICSID Convention states, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n169.\n\nThe present dispute, in the context of the von Pezold arbitration (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), has been submitted to arbitration pursuant to the Swiss BIT and the German BIT. The present dispute, in the context of the Border arbitration (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25), has been submitted to arbitration pursuant to the Swiss BIT only.\n\n170.\n\nArticle 10(3) of the Swiss BIT provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the present Agreement and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties; the terms of any particular agreement that has been concluded with respect to the investment; the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, including its rules on the conflict of laws; such rules of international law as may be applicable\".\n\n171.\n\nArticle 11(2) of the German BIT provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal constituted pursuant to the said Convention shall reach its decisions on the basis of this Agreement, any treaties in force between the Contracting Parties, such rules of general international law as may be applicable, and the domestic law of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the Investment inquestion is situated\".\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal will revert to the applicable law and, in particular, the application of Zimbabwean law, where appropriate, in its discussion of the issues below.\n\n(2) Burden of Proof\n-------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Parties have addressed the Tribunal on burden of proof in the particular context of jurisdiction. However, the same principles as discussed below apply *mutatis mutandis* to the Parties\u2019 respective positions advanced on the merits of the case as well.\n\n174.\n\nThe general rule is that the party asserting the claim bears the burden of establishing It by proof. Where claims and counterclaims go to the same factual issue, each party bears the burden of proof as to its own contentions. There is no general notion of shifting of the burden of proof when jurisdictional objections are asserted. The Respondent in this case therefore bears the burden of proving its objections. Conversely, the Claimants must prove any facts asserted inresponse to the Respondent\u2019s objections and bear the overall burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists.\n\n175.\n\nThe main exception to the above rule is where a rebuttable presumption exists. Although It is unclear, the Respondent appears to be arguing that a rebuttable presumption exists such that the production of \"relevant facts\" will establish a *prima facie* case, to be affirmatively disprove by the Claimants.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal is not aware of any rebuttable presumption operating in relation to objections to jurisdiction, and the Respondent has not offered any authority for this proposition. The Tribunal therefore considers that no such presumption applies, and that the general principle applies to require the Respondent to produce sufficient evidence to establish its objections to jurisdiction.\n\n(3) Standard of Proof\n---------------------\n\n177.\n\nIn general, the standard of proof applied in International arbitration is that a claim must be proven on the \"balance of probabilities\". There are no special circumstances that would warrant the application of a lower or higher standard of proof in the present case. It is also unclear what standard the Respondent considers should apply, if not the balance of probabilities.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider there is any reason to depart from standard practice and both Parties must prove their claims on the balance of probabilities.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n179.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\nArticle 25\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n180.\n\nThere are, essentially, four elements that must be satisfied to establish jurisdiction under Article 25:\n\n\u2022 A legal dispute;\n\n\u2022 Arising directly out of an Investment;\n\n\u2022 Between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State; and\n\n\u2022 Consent in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre.\n\n181.\n\nEach element is discussed in detail below.\n\n(2) The Existence of the Legal Dispute\n--------------------------------------\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to question that the disputes between the Parties are properly characterized as legal disputes for the purposes of jurisdiction. The Respondent does, however, present a different characterization of the disputes and, in particular, a different narrative surrounding the nature and purpose of the LRP than that presented by the von Pezold and Border Claimants. For example, the Respondent stated in its Counter-Memorial (see CM, paras., 57-71):\n\nThe Land Reform Programme was and remains a genuine exercise for the redistribution of land and the resettlement of the landless majority. As will be observed from the afore going land to be redistributed was owned by white people and it is from them that it had to be taken for redistribution to the landless blacks.\n\nThe Impatience of the landless masses reached boiling point In 2000 resulting in Invasions which coincided with the rejection of the Draft Constitution. The invasions were never a policy nor were they an integral part of the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme as alleged by the Claimants in paragraphs 550 and 554 of the Memorial, but were a spontaneous reaction by the landless people. The Draft Constitution contained provisions relating to the acquisition of land for resettlement and placed the onus for providing compensation for the acquired farms on the former colonial power. The Government of Zimbabwe would now pay for infrastructural improvements on the land but not for the land itself.\n\nWhen the Constitution was rejected it was yet another blow to the expectations of those who had sacrificed their lives for the return of land to the black people, the Liberation War Veterans (War Vets). It was now 20 years after gaining independence and there was little to show in terms of access to land for the majority of Zimbabweans.\n\nThe reasons for the rejection of the Draft Constitution were more political than anything else. They were not a rejection of the need for redistribution of land. The Fast Track Programme was accordingly launched on the 15th of July 2000. The acquisition of land and the resettlement of people was now to be undertaken in an accelerated manner with reliance on domestic resources.\n\nThe purpose of the Fast Track was to:\n\n\u2022 Speed up the identification of land for compulsory acquisition. The target was not less than 5 million hectares of land for resettlement\n\n\u2022 Accelerate the planning and demarcation of acquired land for resettlement\n\n\u2022 Provide basic infrastructure (boreholes, dip tanks and access roads) and farmer support services (tillage and agricultural inputs)\n\n\u2022 Simultaneously resettle people in all provinces to ensure that the reform programme was comprehensive and evenly implemented\n\n\u2022 Provide secondary infrastructure such as schools, clinics and rural service centres.\n\nDuring this Phase, land was acquired on a compulsory basis in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act [Chapter 20:10] as amended....\n\nInitially, Government laid down a framework under which farms once gazetted for acquisition could be de-listed for valid reasons, for example, if the farms were plantation farms in the large scale production of tea, coffee, timber, citrus, sugar cane etc. Also included were agro- industrial properties involved in integrated production, farms in Export Processing Zones, farms belonging to church or mission organizations, conservancies and farms belonging to foreign nationals who are protected by BIPPAs.\n\nDespite this goodwill on the part of Government some farm owners abused the delisting framework in a bid to frustrate the land reform process. Some farmers deliberately changed land use to avoid compulsory acquisition of their farms. For example some farmers shared their dairy cattle in order to be exempted. Others introduced wildlife onto agricultural land.\n\nFormer farm owners also made the process of land acquisition long and cumbersome. Because the Land Acquisition Act required the serving of notices to the owner and confirmation of acquisition through the Administrative Court, the former owners mounted all sorts of legal challenges including wrong citation of their names or companies to frustrate the acquisition.\n\nThese challenges slowed down the acquisition and resettlement process to a snail\u2019s pace. The court processes were now blocking meaningful progress in the Land Reform Programme. It became necessary to promulgate a law that promoted the goals and purposes of land reform in the Republic, a historical mandate (paragraph 552 Memorial). The Constitutional Amendment No 17 of 2005 was enacted to meet this need. It provided for compulsory acquisition of agricultural land without recourse to the courts save for Issues of compensation for Improvements.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe acquisition of nearly 11 million hectares from the previous 3, 5 million (by 2000) can be attributed to this change in the law. Overall over 14 million hectares have been acquired for resettlement to date and 145 775 A1 and 18 289 A2 beneficiaries resettled thereon. The most Important goal of redressing the thorny reality of historical Inequities inland ownership has been substantially achieved.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent thus frames the disputes with the von Pezold and Border Claimants in the context of a historical narrative arising out of Zimbabwe\u2019s colonial past.\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe von Pezold and Border Claimants, by contrast, have described the background to the Parties\u2019 dispute as follows (see Cl. Skel., paras. 2, 5-8):\n\n2. Zimbabwe\u2019s War of Independence ended in 1980. The Government subsequently encouraged reconciliation and foreign Investment, including Investment from the Claimants. During the period 1980 to 2000, 70% of all farms that existed at Independence had been bought and sold in the open market or purchased by the Respondent at the fair market value.\n\n\u2026\n\n5. After Independence, land reform was a low priority for the Government. The Government\u2019s stated policy under the Land Reform Programme (\"LRP\") was to acquire no more than 8.3 million ha of the 15.5 million ha of commercial farm land (the great majority of which was owned by white Zimbabweans). As at 2000, it had acquired only 3.66 million ha. The post 2000 phases of the LRP are collectively referred to as the \"aggressive phases\".\n\n6. From 2000 onward, the LRP had the aim of removing every white farmer from his or her land. In simple terms it was racist, breaching the prohibition against discrimination on grounds of race or colour - a peremptory norm of general International law. It also had the aim of allocating farms that had been expropriated to senior members of the government, ZANU-PF and the military and civil services. In particular, in-February 2000, after losing a referendum (blamed on the white vote), the Respondent Instigated the Invasion of commercial farms. If It did not Instigate them then shortly after they commenced, it took control of them and encouraged them. The Invasions became an Integral part of the LRP. In July 2000, the Respondent commenced Phase II, Fast Track of the LRP. Pursuant to this phase, the Respondent Issued thousands of s5 Notices Identifying properties for expropriation. However, the courts held that many of the s5 Notices were Invalid. On 14 September 2005, the Respondent enacted s16B of the Constitution (\"the Constitutional Amendment\"). The effect of the Constitutional Amendment was to expropriate the farms of nearly every white farmer in-Zimbabwe (of the 4,500 white farmers farming in 2000, today there are less than 200 whose farms have not been expropriated). Most of the Claimants\u2019 properties have been expropriated pursuant to the Constitutional Amendment.\n\n7. The economic decline caused by the aggressive phases of the LRP led the Respondent to introduce a perverse foreign exchange policy, which has caused the Claimants significant losses. The Respondent\u2019s own courts have stated that the foreign exchange obtained through this policy was used by the Government for illegal purposes.\n\n8. In parallel with the LRP, and indeed during it, the Respondent ratified a number of BITs, including the German BIT on 14 April 2000 (provisional entry into force was 18 September 1996) and the Swiss BIT on 9 February 2001. Property and compensation rights protected by BITs were given a special status under Zimbabwean law when s16(9b) of the Constitution was enacted in 1996. Further, the Government\u2019s LRP policy expressly excluded from expropriation properties covered by BITs, together with tea, coffee, timber and citrus plantations. On numerous occasions the Respondent acknowledged that the Claimants\u2019 investments were covered by the BITs, and stated that they would not be subjected to the LRP. Nevertheless, despite the Respondent stating in 2005, by way of a Note Verbale, that the Constitutional Amendment had not expropriated the Claimants\u2019 investments (and thereby confirming prior assurances), in 2007 the Respondent stated that they had been expropriated by the Constitutional Amendment. The Claimants accept that they have been expropriated.\n\n185.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants (save for R\u00fcdiger) and the Border Claimants present their **\"Main Claims\"** (i.e., those claims raised in the Memorial) as claims arising from the Implementation of the LRP. They allege breaches of the Swiss BIT, customary International law and domestic law that have caused them to suffer damage. The von Pezold Claimants also allege breaches of the German BIT that have caused them to suffer damage, and R\u00fcdiger also alleges breaches of customary International law. The von Pezold Claimants allege the breach of the expropriation standard, the FET standard, the non-impairment standard, the FPS standard and the FTP standard of the Swiss BIT (save for R\u00fcdiger) and the German BIT, and breach of the Impairment or diminishment standard of the Danish BIT through the most-favoured nation (\"MFN\") provisions of the Swiss and German BITs (see above para. 88, the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief). The Border Claimants allege the same breaches of the Swiss BIT, customary International law and domestic law as the von Pezold Claimants.\n\n186.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 dispute in connection with the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 \"Additional Claims\" (i.e., those claims raised after submission of the Memorial and relating to water rights and permits) are raised solely under the German BIT39. The first Additional Claim relates to water rights which attached to the Forrester Estate (the **\"Water Rights\")** (see Reply, paras. 430-433, a list of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Water Rights - Forrester Estate is reproduced in the Claimants\u2019 Reply, Table 1. This table is reproduced as Annex D to the Operative Part of the present Award):\n\nUnder the Water Act 1976, and its predecessors, the right to use \"public water\" for agricultural purposes, attached to the majority of the Forrester Properties and vested in the von Pezold Claimants. These rights to use public water are referred to as \"Water Rights\". No charge was levied by the Respondent on the holders of Water Rights for the consumption of water, and once granted in their final form they were not to expire.\n\nHowever, upon the commencement in January 2000 of the Water Act 1998 and the Zimbabwe National Water Authority Act 1998 (the \"ZNWA Act\"), the regulatory regime for the use of water changed significantly.\n\nPursuant to the Water Act 1998, Water Rights have been converted into \"permits\" (\"Permits\"). Permits to use water only last for a period of twenty years. Moreover, pursuant to the ZNWA Act, the Respondent is empowered to, and does in fact, charge significant amounts for water consumed for agricultural purposes.\n\nIt is recalled that all of the von Pezold Claimants are German nationals.\n\n187.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants allege that the Forrester Water Rights were directly expropriated by the Respondent on 1 January 2000 by the repeal of the *Water Act 1976* and the commencement *of the Water Act 1998* and, in particular, section 124 of the *Water Act 1998* which extinguished all Water Rights (replacing them Instead with Water Permits). In the alternative, the von Pezold Claimants allege that, as a matter of customary International law and Article 4(2) of the German BIT, the Water Rights were Indirectly expropriated by the Respondent on 1 January 2000 by the repeal of the *Water Act 1976* and the commencement of the *Water Act 1998,* in that the rights that exist under a Water Permit are so different and much-diminished from those that existed under a Water Right that the overall effect has been to cause a radical deprivation to the economical use and enjoyment of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 right to use public water on the Forrester Estate (see Reply, paras. 530-533). As well as compensation for the conversion of the Forrester Water Rights into Water Permits in the year 2000, the von Pezold Claimants also seek restitution of the resulting Water Permits (hereinafter referred to as the **\"Forrester Water Permits\")** (see Reply, para. 559). These Forrester Water Permits, as with the Makandi Water Permits discussed below, were allegedly expropriated along with the Forrester Properties pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment. The von Pezold Claimants therefore seek restitution of the Forrester Water Permits along with the Forrester Properties (see von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Corrected Request for Relief, para 8.12.1)40.\n\nAlthough the Forrester Water Permits are labelled \"final Water Rights\" in Table 1 of the Claimants\u2019 Reply (as are the Makandi Water Permits in Table 3 of the Claimants\u2019 Reply), it is clear from the context that what the von Pezold Claimants seek by way of restitution under para. 8.12.1 of the Corrected Request for Relief is restitution of the Forrester Water Permits existing in 2005, at the time the Forrester Properties were expropriated. The losses suffered by the von Pezold Claimants in the years 2000 and 2005 constitute separate heads of loss.\n\n188.\n\nThe second Additional Claim relates to alleged expropriation of the Water Permits (created under the *Water Act 1998)* which attached to the Makandi Estate **(\"Makandi Water Permits\")** (see Reply, paras. 561-562). The von Pezold Claimants allege that the Makandi Water Permits were exporopriated when the Makandi Properties were expropriated pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment. Unlike the Forrester Water Rights, the von Pezold Claimants do not bring a claim for expropriation of the Makandi Water Rights (through conversion into Water Permits In 2000) because they did not own a qualifying Interest in the Makandi Estate at that time:\n\nAt the time that the Parent Claimants acquired their contractual and beneficial rights in the Makandi Estate in May 2005, the Water Rights that previously existed in relation to the Makandi Estate had already (in 2000) been converted into Permits.... Therefore the Claimants do not make any claims in relation to those prior Water Rights.\n\nHowever,..., the Parent Claimants in seeking the restitution of the Makandi Properties also seek the restitution of the final Permits attaching to them. Without access to water through the Permits, the Parent Claimants will incur significant losses.\n\n189.\n\nThe Parent Claimants contend that the Water Permits are part of the Makandi Estate as they attached to the Makandi Properties as at the date the Parent Claimants obtained their Interest in the Makandi Estate (see Reply, para. 563, a list of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Water Permits -Makandi Estate is reproduced in the Claimants\u2019 Reply, Table 3. This table is reproduced as Annex E to the Operative Part of the present Award).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n190.\n\nAs noted above, fulfillment of the first element of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the existence of a legal dispute, is not contested. Simply put, the Parties\u2019 disputes in connection with the Main Claims arise from the Implementation of the LRP and, in particular, from the enactment of provisions of the 2005 Constitutional Amendment. The dispute in connection with the \"Additional Claims\" arises from a change in the legal regime governing water rights, I.e. the *Water Act 1976.*\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this first element of Article 25 is satisfied in respect of both the von Pezold and Border Claimants.\n\n(3) Consent in Writing under the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to the fourth element of the Article 25 test, regarding consent, inview of the prominence of this element among the Respondent\u2019s objections.\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe main thrust of the Respondent\u2019s various jurisdictional objections is that it did not consent to the arbitration of the Claimants\u2019 claims in connection with the above disputes. The Respondent takes this position on the basis of its Interpretation of the relevant BITs, as discussed indetail below.\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 expression of consent, detailed below, is said to be predicated on the advance consent extended by the Respondent in the dispute settlement provisions of the German and Swiss BITs.\n\n195.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants state that they have expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration in at least two ways. First, in a letter dated 9 November 2009, addressed to the Zimbabwean Minister of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion (delivered on 30 November 2009) and the Zimbabwean Minister of Finance (delivered on 11 December 2009), each of the von Pezold Claimants (except Adam) through their counsel consented to submit the present legal dispute to ICSID arbitration. By letter dated 2 March 2010, addressed to the Zimbabwean Minister of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion (delivered on 17 March 2010) and the Zimbabwean Minister of Finance (delivered on 17 March 2010), Adam, through counsel, consented to submit the present legal dispute to ICSID arbitration. Second, in their Request for Arbitration, filed on 10 June 2010, the von Pezold Claimants restated and \"ratified\" their consent to submit the present legal dispute to ICSID arbitration (see Request for Arbitration, 10 June 2010, paras. 105-107; see also Reply, para. 505).\n\n196.\n\nThe Border Claimants similarly state that they have expressed their consent to submit the present legal dispute to ICSID arbitration in their Request for Arbitration, filed on 3 December 2010 (see Request for Arbitration, 3 December 2010, para. 95).\n\n197.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants take the position that:\n\n\u2022 the date on which the parties in Case No. ARB/10/15 consented to submit their dispute to ICSID arbitration is 30 November 2009 (17 March 2010 for Adam) at the earliest, or as of the date of filing of the Request for Arbitration (i.e., 10 June 2010) at the latest (see Request for Arbitration, 10 June 2010, para. 108); and\n\n\u2022 the date on which the parties in Case No. ARB/10/25 consented to submit their dispute to ICSID arbitration is 3 December 2010, the date on which the Border Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration (see Request for Arbitration, 3 December 2010, para. 96).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nIt is clear that the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants have consented to the arbitrations. Both the German and Swiss BITs provide, in their respective dispute settlement provisions, that the Contracting Parties consent to submit disputes meeting certain criteria to arbitration under the ICSID Convention If they are not settled within six months of the date on which they were raised. Specifically, the dispute settlement provisions of the German and Swiss BITs provide as follows:\n\n**Article 11 of the German BIT**\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of such national or company in the territory of the former Contracting Party shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If the dispute is not settled within six months of the date when it is raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the national or company concerned, be submitted for arbitration. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit the dispute to arbitration. Unless the parties in dispute agree otherwise, the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 18th March, 1965. The arbitral tribunal constituted pursuant to the said Convention shall reach its decisions on the basis of this Agreement, any treaties to force between the Contracting parties, such rules of general international law as may be applicable, and the domestic law of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment in question is situated.\n\n(3) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or remedy other than that provided for in the said Convention. The award shall be enforced in accordance with the domestic law of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment in question is situated.\n\n(4) During arbitration proceedings or proceedings for the enforcement of an award, the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the objection that the national or company concerned has received compensation under an insurance contract in respect of all or part of his or its damage or losses.\n\n**Article 10 of the Swiss BIT**\n\n(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without prejudice to Article 11 of this Agreement (Disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months and if the investor concerned gives written consent, the dispute shall be submitted to the arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of investment Disputes, instituted by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, for the settlement of disputes regarding investments between States and nationals of other States.\n\nEach party may start the procedure by addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre as foreseen by Article 28 and 36 of the above-mentioned Convention. Should the parties disagree on whether conciliation or arbitration is the most appropriate procedure, the investor concerned shall have the final decision.\n\n(3) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the present Agreement and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties; the terms of any particular agreement that has been concluded with respect to the investment; the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, including its rules on the conflict of laws; such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n(4) The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not at any time during the procedures assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has received compensation under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage or loss.\n\n(5) Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels a dispute submitted to the arbitration of the Centre unless the other Contracting party does not abide by and comply with the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal.\n\n(6) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the parties involved in the dispute and shall be enforceable in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in which the investment in question is located.\n\n199.\n\nBased on the foregoing provisions, it is equally clear that the Respondent has consented through the BITs, provided the relevant criteria are satisfied. The Tribunal so finds. The relevant criteria are discussed below.\n\n**C. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n(1) The ICSID Convention\n------------------------\n\n(i) Article 25(2)(a)\n--------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, which defines a national of another Contracting State for purposes of establishing jurisdiction, provides as follows:\n\n2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not Include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n201.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants evidence their nationality for the purpose of satisfying Article 25(2)(a) by reference to their German and Swiss passports and national Identity cards, the details of which are provided at para. 87 of the 10 June 2010 Request for Arbitration41. All of the von Pezold Claimants, save for R\u00fcdiger, claim to be nationals of both Germany and Switzerland. R\u00fcdiger claims to be a national of Germany.\n\nSee also C-1 to C-17, which contain copies of the relevant pages of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 passports and identity cards.\n\n202.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent admitted that all of the von Pezold Claimants, save for R\u00fcdiger, are nationals of both Germany and Switzerland and that R\u00fcdiger is a national of Germany. The Respondent also stated, however, that documents filed with Company House in-Zimbabwe Indicated that Heinrich von Pezold **(\"Heinrich\")** and R\u00fcdiger were Zimbabwean citizens (see CM, para. 5).\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent did not pursue this allegation in its subsequent pleadings, although in its Post-Hearing Brief it raised the matter again in the form of a misrepresentation argument.\n\n204.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants denied that Heinrich or R\u00fcdiger has ever been a Zimbabwean citizen and explained that the documents relied upon by the Respondent reflected clerical errors made by the accountants who had filed them (see Reply, paras. 14-15). All of the von Pezold Claimants have also stated that none of them are Zimbabwean nationals (see Request for Arbitration, 10 June 2010, para. 114).\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied on its review of the evidence that each of the von Pezold Claimants fulfils the nationality criteria under Article 25(2)(a) and the Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the von Pezold Claimants under the ICSID Convention.\n\n(ii) Article 25(2)(b)\n---------------------\n\na) Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent has asserted that Elisabeth\u2019s control of the Border Claimants is inadequate for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, because it is indirect, and therefore the Border Claimants do not satisfy the nationality criteria of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the decisions in *AMCO Asia Corporation & Others v. Indonesia*  ***(\"Amco Asia\")***(see ICSID Reports 389, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, CLEX-392) and *Tradex Hellas SA v. Republic of Albania*  ***(Tradex)***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Award, 29 April 1999, RLEX-11) for the proposition that indirect control does not constitute foreign control for the purposes of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction (see Rejoinder, paras. 937-938). The Respondent notes that in *AMCO Asia* there were five degrees of intermediate control as between the putative foreign investor and the local entity, and here the \"Claimants need even more than ten organograms to try to prove their control of the local companies\" (see Rejoinder, para. 938). The Respondent also refers to the following passage in the *Tradex* award, a case which the Respondent contends presented a similar situation to the one in these cases (see Rejoinder, para. 939; Resp. Skel., para. 55, quoting *Tradex,* para. 118, RLEX-11):\n\nIn its summary of the Investments it claims to have made (particularly in T III p. 7 seq.), Tradex mentions a number of Investments not in Albania, but in other countries allegedly in favour of the Joint Venture. In this context, the Tribunal notes that, according to Art. 1(3) of the 1993 Law, only those Investments qualify to be covered by that Law that are made \u2018in the territory of the Republic of Albania\u2019. In principle, therefore, Investments made by Tradex outside Albania do not qualify.\n\n208.\n\nIn its Rebutter (see Rebutter, para. 222), the Respondent referred to the tribunal\u2019s summary of the elements required to establish foreign control for ICSID jurisdiction in *Autopista Concesionada de* *Venezuela CA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*  ***(\"Autopista\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/00/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, CLEX-189):\n\nThe cases decided under Article 25(2)(b) establish that the \"foreign control\" referred to in the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) means foreign control by nationals of a Contracting State party to the Convention. Moreover, such \"foreign control\" must meet an objective standard (Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v. Government of the Republic of Ghana (Case No. ARB/92/1) Award of February 16, 1994, 4 ICSID Reports 165 (1994), Ven. Auth. 9). As a result, an arbitral tribunal must take into account the true control relationship (Banro American Resources, Inc. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aurif\u00e8re du Kivu et du Maniema, SARL v. the Democratic Republic of Congo (Case No. ARB/98/7), Award Declining Jurisdiction of September 1, 2000, Ven. Auth. 2; LETCO, Ven Auth. 6; SOABI, Ven Auth. 8, Christopher Schreuer, Commentary on the ICSID Convention, 12 ICSID Review -FILJ 59 (1997) (Second Installment of Commentaries Discussing Article 25), 560, 562-563, Ven. Auth. 11).\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent also referred to the tribunal\u2019s discussion of control in *Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v. Republic of Ghana*  ***(\"Vacuum Salt\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1, Award, 16 February 1994, CLEX-177) as follows (see Rebutter, para. 225, quoting *Vacuum Salt)-.*\n\nThe Tribunal notes, and itself confirms, that \"foreign control\" within the meaning of the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) does not require, or imply, any particular percentage of share ownership. Each case arising under that clause must be viewed in its own particular context, on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances. There is no \"formula.\" It stands to reason, of course, that 100 percent foreign ownership almost certainly would result inforeign control, by whatever standard, and that a total absence of foreign shareholding would virtually preclude the existence of such control. How much is \"enough,\" however, cannot be determined abstractly. Thus, in the course of the drafting of the Convention, it was said variously that \"Interests sufficiently Important to be able to block major changes in the company\" could amount to a \"controlling Interest\" (Convention History, Vol. 11, 447); that \"control could in fact be acquired by persons holding only 25 percent of' a company's capital (id., 447-48); and even that \"51% of the shares might not be controlling\" while for some purposes \"15% was sufficient\" (Id., 538).\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that control is a \"clearly defined chain, each link of which meets the applicable legal standard\" and that the Claimants \"have not demonstrated that continuous chain as there [sic] holdings and organograms are wilfully untraceable, probably for tax reasons.\" (see Rebutter, para. 223).\n\nb) Claimants\u2019 Position\n----------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimants submit that control requires consideration of all facts and circumstances, relying on *Vacuum Salt42,* and that Indirect control may be control for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (see Cl. Skel., para. 13; Cl. PHB, para. 14). The Claimants rely on *Soc\u00ed\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industri\u00e9is (SOABI) v. Republic of Senegal*  ***(SOABI)***(see 2 ICSID Reports 165, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 August 1984, CLEX-393) and *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V. and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*  ***(\"Mobil\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/7/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, CLEX-410) in support of their latter point that indirect control is sufficient for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The following quote from *SOABI* is emphasized by the Claimants (see*SOABI,* paras. 35-37, CLEX-393):\n\nThe nationality of this company, which held in 1975 all of SOABI\u2019s subscribed capital shares, could only be determinative of the nationality of the foreign Interests if the Convention were concerned only with direct control of the company. However, the Tribunal cannot accept such an Interpretation, which would be contrary to the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) infine. This purpose, it is hardly necessary to observe, is to reconcile, on the one hand, the desire of States hosting foreign Investments to see those Investments managed by companies established under local law and, on the other hand, their desire to give those companies standing in ICSID proceedings.\n\nSOABI is a perfect example of this, being a company established under Senegalese law to which the capacities of a national of another Contracting State have been granted.\n\nIt is obvious that, just as a host State may prefer that Investments be channelled through a company Incorporated under domestic law, Investors may be led for reasons of their own to Invest their funds through Intermediary entitles while retaining the same degree of control over the national company as they would have exercised as direct shareholders of the latter.\n\nThe Claimants refer to *Vacuum Salt,* para. 43, in support of this point. Specifically, the *Vacuum Salt* tribunal held that that the second limb of Article 25(2)(b) does not require or imply any particular percentage or share ownership, but noted that 100% ownership would almost certainly result in control whereas the total absence of any shareholding would virtually preclude the existence of control. The tribunal stated that the smaller the shareholding the \"more one must look to other elements bearing on that issue\", such as management.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants also point to the *Mobil* tribunal\u2019s discussion of Article 25(2)(b) as follows (see Surrejoinder, para. 127, quoting *Mobil,* paras. 153, 154 and 157, CLEX-410):\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) owns 100 % of its US and Bahamian subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries are thus controlled directly or indirectly by a \u2018legal person constituted under the law\u2019 of the Netherlands. Accordingly they must be deemed to be Dutch nationals under article 1 (b) (iii) of the BIT.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Respondent submits however, that this article is Incompatible with Article 25 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention which, according to Venezuela, excludes the use of the control test for the determination of a corporation\u2019s nationality.\n\nHowever Article 25(2)(b)(l) does not Impose any particular criteria of nationality (whether place of Incorporation, siege social or control) in the case of juridical persons not having the nationality of the Host State. Thus the parties to the Dutch-Venezuela BIT were free to consider as nationals both the legal persons constituted under the law of one of the Parties and those constituted under another law, but controlled by such legal persons. The BIT is thus compatible with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants distinguish *Amco Asia* on the basis that there was no agreement in that case concerning control as there is here in the form of Article 1(1)(c) of the Swiss BIT (see Cl. Skel., para. 13). The Claimants also submit that to the extent *Amco Asia* purports to limit the examination of control to the company immediately above the company incorporated in the host State, it was wrongly decided and has not been followed, as evidenced by the cases discussed above. Moreover there is nothing in the second limb of Article 25(2)(b) which indicates that such a restriction is required (see Surrejoinder, para. 120). The Claimants also point to the testimony of Mr. Moyo who admitted that, in Zimbabwe, property is often held through companies (see Cl. PHB, para. 15, referring to Tr. Day 6, p. 1618, lines 18-21).\n\n214.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s reliance on *Autopista* to argue the opposite conclusion is misplaced, averring that the tribunal in that case did not decide that control could, as a general matter, only be by way of direct control (see Cl. Skel., para. 13).\n\nc) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied on its review of the evidence, and in particular that of Elisabeth and Heinrich, that the Border Claimants satisfy the criteria of Article 25(2)(b) on the basis of foreign control. The Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the \"chain of control\" is broken in this case because of the presence of intermediary companies through which the von Pezolds\u2019 interest in the Border Claimants is held. The evidence clearly demonstrates that Elisabeth exercises overall control of the Border Companies and that R\u00fcdiger, the Adult Children Claimants and Adam abide by Elisabeth\u2019s exercise of ultimate control over those companies. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention have been met and that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Border Claimants under the ICSID Convention.\n\n(2) The BITs\n------------\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Border Claimants are \"controlled\" by any of the Swiss von Pezold Claimants, but it does so by reference to the meaning of \"foreign control\" in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, as opposed to \"effective control\" in Article 1 (1)(c) of the Swiss BIT. The Respondent\u2019s submissions on \"foreign control\", for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, are dealt with in Section VI.C(1) above.\n\n217.\n\nWhile not expressly connected with the Claimants\u2019 assertion of jurisdiction on the basis of Article 1(1)(c) of the Swiss BIT, the Respondent also submits that, as a result of an alleged failure to prove factual control as between the individual von Pezold Claimants, one of whom is German, the Claimants\u2019 claims under the Swiss BIT must be rejected. The Respondent does not distinguish, in this argument, as between the claims of the Swiss von Pezold Claimants and the claims of the Border Claimants. However, the Respondent\u2019s arguments appear to be relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of \"effective control\" for the purpose of determining its jurisdiction over the Border Claimants\u2019 claims. The Respondent\u2019s original submissions are set out in its Rejoinder, as follows (see Rejoinder, paras. 986-987):\n\nTo the extent that Claimants have hidden behind their nebulous, complex, obscure, holding structures, and abstained from proving the exact holder and amount of each stakeholder and given the fact that R\u00fcdiger is among the key beneficiaries, trustees and ultimate decision-makers, the entirety of the von Pezold and Border Estate claims should be dismissed as no proof of each Investment has been submitted and one of the Parent Claimants does not have any legal basis for his Claims and consequently there is no certain amount to be considered under the Swiss BIT.\n\nIn light of the above, not only must all Claimants\u2019 claims be dismissed under the German BIT but also under the Swiss BIT as Claimants have failed to prove the Identity and holding that might otherwise benefit from consideration of hypothetical protection under the Swiss BIT.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent further stated the following in its Rebutter (see Rebutter, para. 116; Resp. PHB, para. 219):\n\nAs set out in Paragraph 986 of Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, there is no determinable amount of claims to be considered under the Swiss BIT as Claimant R\u00fcdiger is not Swiss and the intermingled holdings, control, beneficiaries (named and unnamed), trustee and ultimate decision-makers are not determinable, so Claimants\u2019 demands under the Swiss BIT must be rejected.\n\n219.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent argued that while the Claimants had focused on the \"theoretical grounds of \u2018control\u2019\", the Respondent had challenged the factual ground of who controlled what, and the Claimants have failed to prove their alleged ownership and control. The Respondent refers, by way of example, to the following statement in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial in support of its view that the Claimants have still not proven ownership (see Resp. PHB, paras. 171 and 222) :\n\nThe working capital of their investments may be a mix of their own money, finance from other Investors, commercial banks and government owned development finance Institutions that are mandated to Invest indeveloping markets.\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondent appears to allege that: because R\u00fcdiger has a \"stake in the Claimants\u2019 holdings\"; because that \"stake is undefined\"; because R\u00fcdiger has a key role in the control of the \"Claimants\u2019 assets\"; and because German evidence \"occupies a central role in the record\", no damages can be assessed under the Swiss BIT because there is a lack of precision as to who owns and controls what (see Resp. PHB, para. 222).\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Border Claimants, although nationals of Zimbabwe, claim Swiss nationality pursuant to Article 1(1)(c) of the Swiss BIT by reason of having been effectively controlled by Swiss nationals and, in particular, by Elisabeth, a Swiss national (see Cl. PHB, para. 15). The Claimants contend that \"effective control\" of the Border Claimants existed by means of both factual and legal control, as follows (see Cl. PHB, para. 16; see also Cl. PHB, paras. 17-21):\n\n... Factual control arose because Elisabeth is the source of the family\u2019s wealth, and because the family acknowledges that she is inoverall control. Further, Heinrich (Swiss), since 1998, has managed the Border Company Claimants, subject to Elisabeth\u2019s overall control. Legal control arose because the Swiss Family members vote their 48.36% Interest in Border as a block led by Elisabeth. This gives negative control as it permits the blocking of special resolutions, which require 75% of the vote. Further, R\u00fcdiger (German) always voted his 38.13% in Border in the same manner as the Swiss Family Members. This gave the Swiss Family Members positive control with 86.49% of the issued share capital of Border. The legal control has existed since 1992, when Elisabeth and R\u00fcdiger acquired 25.65% of Border. Mr Schofield confirmed that it was further supplemented in 2000 when the von Pezolds were granted joint management of Border by its then majority shareholder, which required their consent for all management decisions. The management agreement fell away in 2003, when the von Pezolds Increased their shareholding to 86%. [citations omitted]\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the term \"effective control\", although not defined in the Swiss BIT, means \"real control, as opposed to the mere appearance of control; it encompasses direct and indirect control, so long as it is effective\" (see Cl. PHB, para. 13).\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimants have interpreted the Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding direct and indirect claims as an independent ground of challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 claims and the Border Claimants\u2019 claims (see below Section VI.D (1)(i)), as opposed to a challenge to the Border Claimants\u2019 standing to claim under Article 1 (1)(c) of the Swiss BIT. It is noted, however, that the Claimants say they have established their beneficial ownership through the provision of title deeds, share certificates and family trust deeds, all of which are supported by organograms (see Cl. PHB, para. 33). The von Pezold Claimants also note that this same evidence states the percentage that each Claimant owns in the Zimbabwean Companies (including the Border Companies). The von Pezold Claimants affirm that, the investments are ultimately controlled by Elisabeth (see Cl. Skel., para. 33; Cl. PHB, para. 33), and that, although Elisabeth stated in her testimony that she did not understand the detail of the organograms she confirmed that she, together with her family, owns the Estates (see Tr. Day 2, p. 463, lines 11-15).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAs discussed above in connection with the ICSID Convention nationality requirements, it is clear that the von Pezold Claimants are not Zimbabwean citizens and that they satisfy the nationality requirements of the relevant BITs in the case of each individual Claimant. The nationality point, in respect of the von Pezold Claimants, has not been argued strongly by the Respondent and therefore the Tribunal does not linger on it here. The Tribunal is satisfied that the documents filed with the Company House in Zimbabwe referring to Heinrich and R\u00fcdiger as Zimbabwean citizens were filed in error. There is no evidence that either Claimant was ever a citizen of Zimbabwe.\n\n225.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the von Pezold Claimants (save for R\u00fcdiger) under the Swiss and German BITs and over R\u00fcdiger under the German BIT.\n\n226.\n\nWith regard to the Border Claimants, which were incorporated in Zimbabwe, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants have shown the Border Companies were \"effectively controlled\" by Swiss nationals and thereby satisfy the requirements of the Swiss BIT. Even if R\u00fcdiger has an interest in the companies, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Companies are effectively controlled by Swiss nationals and, in particular, by Elisabeth. The day-to-day management of the Border Companies by Heinrich is further evidence that they satisfy the requirements of the Swiss BIT. On this basis, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s assertion that only theoretical control has been made out; effective control (both factual and legal) is supported by the evidence. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Border Claimants under the Swiss BIT.\n\n**D. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n(1) The ICSID Convention\n------------------------\n\n(i) Introduction\n----------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Parent Claimants state that their investments include shares owned by them in the Zimbabwean Companies (the **\"Zimbabwean Company Shares\"),** the Zimbabwean Properties, the Residual Properties, other income-generating assets (i.e., moveable and immoveable property, including factories, saw mills, machinery and implements owned by the Zimbabwean Companies), the Water Permits attaching to the Forrester and Makandi Estates, 4,500 tonnes of maize owned by Forrester Estate (Private) Limited (the **\"Seized Maize\"),** foreign exchange and Zimbabwean dollar bank accounts, returns on investments, the exchange rate promise held in the name of Forrester Estate (Private) Limited by the Central Bank to transfer a certain sum of US Dollars to Forrester in exchange for the 2008 transfer by Forrester Estate of 25% of its Zimbabwean dollar holdings to the Central Bank (the **\"Forrester Conversion Amount\"),** the Makandi Acquisition Rghts, the Forrester Water Rights and, with respect to Elisabeth alone, loans extended by her between 1994 and 1998 to the Zimbabwean Companies or otherwise to investments in Zimbabwe (the **\"Forrester Loans\")** (see Request for Arbitration, 10 June 2010, para. 119).\n\n228.\n\nThe Adult Children Claimants\u2019 investments are stated to include: the shares they own in Forrester Estate (Private) Limited, Border, Border International and Hangani; the Zimbabwean Companies owned through Forrester Estate (Private) Limited, Border and Hangani; the other assets associated with Forrester Estate (Private) Limited, Border, Border International and Hangani; the 4,500 tonnes of maize owned by Forrester Estate (Private) Limited; foreign exchange in Zimbabwean dollar deposits; returns on investments; the exchange rate promise of the Central Bank; and all other assets associated with those investments (see Request for Arbitration, 10 June 2010, para. 120). Because the Adult Children Claimants\u2019 investments do not include the Makandi Estate, all references below to the \"Claimants\" or \"von Pezold Claimants\" should be understood to exclude the Adult Children Claimants when the Tribunal addresses claims relating to the Makandi Estate.\n\n229.\n\nAdam von Pezold\u2019s investments are stated to include the following: the shares he owned in Forrester Estate (Private) Limited; the Zimbabwean Properties owned through Forrester Estate (Private) Limited; the other assets associated with Forrester Estate (Private) Limited; the 4,500 tonnes of maize owned by Forrester Estate (Private) Limited; returns on investment; the exchange rate promise of the Central Bank; and all other assets associated with those investments (see Request for Arbitration, 10 June 2010, para. 121). Because Adam\u2019s investments do not include the Makandi or Border Estates, all references below to the \"Claimants\" or \"von Pezold Claimants\" should be understood to exclude Adam when the Tribunal addresses claims relating to the Makandi or Border Estates.\n\n230.\n\nThe Border Claimants\u2019 investments are stated to include: Border\u2019s shares in the other Border Claimants, the Zimbabwean and Residual Properties belonging to the Border Estate, the three Border sawmills, the two Border factories, the pole treatment plant,other income-generating assets belonging to the Border Estate, foreign exchange and Zimbabwean dollar bank deposits, returns on investments and all other assets associated with those investments (see Request for Arbitration, 3 December 2010, para. 103).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\na) The *Salini* Test\n--------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondent submits that ICSID tribunals, such as those in *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela*  ***(\"Fedax\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, CLEX-397), *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and italstrade S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*  ***(\"Salini\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction, November 29, 2004, CLEX-438), *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of*  ***Egypt (\"Joy Mining\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, CLEX-212), *Phoenix Action, Ltd.* v. *Czech Republic*  ***(\"Phoenix Action\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, CLEX-240) and *Standard Chartered Bank v. United Republic of Tanzania*  ***(\"Standard Chartered\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, Award, 2 November 2012, RLEX-19), all agree on certain characteristics of investment and have, through their awards, clarified the definition of investment in the ICSID Convention (see Resp. Skel., para. 58).\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimants\u2019 investments did not involve a risk, were of a commercial nature or a mere \"holding\", and offered no contribution or significance to the economic development of Zimbabwe (see Resp. Skel., paras. 58-68; Rejoinder, para. 949). In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent identified additional criteria for an investment as developed in these cases and alleged that the Claimants have not satisfied any of them: duration, risk, not of a commercial nature or a mere holding, contribution or significance to the economic development of the host State, regularity of profit and return, investment made in good faith, and investment made in accordance with the law (see Resp. PHB, para. 155). Despite articulating these additional criteria, such as duration, regularity of profit and return and investment made in good faith, the Respondent has not made specific allegations in respect of these criteria as applied to the Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants\u2019 investments are purely commercial in nature, involving commercial farming activities in which the host State is not involved. The Respondent encourages the Tribunal to take a course of conduct approach, such as the one adopted by the *LETCO* tribunal (see*Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation v. Republic of Liberia, (\"LETCO\") 2* ICSID Reports 343, Award, 31 March 1986, CLEX-167), to determine whether the Claimants\u2019 acquisitions were merely commercial (see Resp. PHB, para. 160, referring to *LETCO* quoting USC \u00a71603(d))43.\n\nUSC \u00a71603(d) states: \"The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose\".\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent also states that the Claimants took on no economic risk at the time of their investment, relying on the following passage from the Claimants\u2019 Memorial in support of this position (see Rejoinder, para. 954, quoting the Claimants\u2019 Memorial at paras. 72-73 and 173):\n\nA central tenet of their business philosophy is to ensure that preservation of their investments for the next generation - as stated, they have lost investments to regime before and they did not wish it to happen again. Before investing they undertake due diligence. Their due diligence includes understanding the economy and local politics, and meeting with government officials in order to understand the host State\u2019s attitude to investors.\n\nTherefore when the von Pezold Claimants have made investments - including in the Republic - they have always carried out significant due diligence in order to ensure that their wealth is protected;\n\n\u2026\n\nHowever, they wished to ensure the preservation of their wealth.\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the Claimants\u2019 invocation of the FPS provisions of the BITs as evidence of the Claimants\u2019 belief that no \"legal or factual risk existed\" because they were protected by \"Rhodesian-style absolute full security and protection\", (see Rejoinder, para. 956).\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the evidence of Minister Mutasa in support of its position that the Claimants made no contribution to the development of Zimbabwe and, forth is reason, do not qualify for protection under the ICSID Convention or the BITs (see Rejoinder, para. 946, quoting Minister Mutasa\u2019s Witness Statement, paras. 32, 33, 34 and 42, R-12):\n\n32. Claimants never contributed anything to Zimbabwe. They drained our land of its resources to increase their family wealth which was already considerable\n\n\u2026\n\n33. Claimants were here to reap profits for themselves only. They did not create anything useful for Zimbabwe. Their only concern was to maximise their individual family\u2019s financial gain. As they never contributed anything positive to our country, in that sense they did not make an investment which merits benefiting from the protections of a BIT in this arbitration...\n\nWe told them \u2018you are no longer wanted here.\u2019\n\n... They have exploited us, contributing nothing to our country, and drained us of our country\u2019s wealth...\n\nWe do not like the greedy ones in any race or culture, those who are selfish, those who contribute nothing to our country but who only thing of taking. We like good people, be they white or otherwise, all good people are accepted and all bad people are not.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent also points to the Claimants\u2019 own description of their choices during the alleged State of Emergency when food was short to feed the Zimbabwean population, whose staple food is maize (see Rejoinder, para. 961, quoting Mem. at para. 266):\n\nGiven that the Forrester Estate has less arable land available, it has given priority to the cultivation of tobacco over maize because it provides a better financial return.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its Intention when entering Into the BITs was to give Incentives to \"new\" Investments, not to perpetuate the \"Rhodesian Way of Life\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 156). By \"new\", the Respondent appears to mean a new Influx of assets, which It contrasts to the holding of assets (see *ibid.* *,* n. 633). The Respondent also appears to advance an argument that \"new\" legal compliance was required at the time when the BITs entered Into force in the event legal requirements for investments made prior to the entry Into force of either BIT had not been satisfied (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n239.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants have, in fact, drained off the riches of the Zimbabwean economy and, based on the dates of the Claimants\u2019 acquisition following the start of the Third Chimurenga44, \"bought the land of departing Europeans betting on their pan-European passports to benefit from a future BIT to cash in some day on their confidential investments.\" (see *ibid.* *,* para. 158).\n\nA \"Chimurenga\", as used by the Respondent, refers to a struggle for liberation or \"uprising\": see CM, paras. 10, 140. It appears that the \"Third Chimurenga\" refers to period of civil unrest beginning around the turn of the century: see Rejoinder, para. 623.\n\nb) Local Assets, Local Investment\n---------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the ICSID Convention is not applicable when an investment is not made by \"foreigners into a host Country\". In the present cases, the Respondent submits that all of the investments were conducted through local Zimbabwean Companies (some of which were originally Rhodesian companies) (see Rejoinder, para. 936) and that the properties in question were first acquired by a Zimbabwean Company, in some cases even before the Claimants indirectly purchased shares of the company owning the land, and since then new acquisitions were made by local companies using their assets such that no foreign investments are at stake (see *ibid.* *,* para. 942).\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the *Tradex* case in support of this objection, and in particular the distinction made by the tribunal as between Tradex and the Albanian joint venture of which it was a part for the purpose of identifying a protected investment (see *ibid.* *,* para. 965, quoting *Tradex,* para. 103):\n\nAs Tradex is the (only) Claimant in this Case, only an Investment by Tradex itself is relevant. It is undisputed between the Parties that the Joint Venture \"Tradex Torovlce\" formed by the Agreement of 10 January 1992 (T1) is a separate legal entity under Albanian law (see Art. 1 paragraph 2 of the Agreement and Section 2 of the Authorization of 21 January 1992 = T2). Therefore, while a Tradex contribution is an Investment covered by the 1993 Law, any investment by the Joint Venture itself is not a \"foreign investment\".\n\n242.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on the *Amco Asia* case in support of its position that the Claimants\u2019 investments are not foreign; it invokes the *Amco Asia* tribunal\u2019s discussion of indirect control where several companies had been interposed between the foreign investor claimant and the local entity45.\n\nThe issue of foreign control for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction has been addressed above; see paras. 215, 226.\n\nc) Origin of Capital\n--------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, because funding for the alleged investments came from Zimbabwe and remained in Zimbabwe, no foreign investments are at stake (see *ibid.* *,* paras. 939, 941, 942 and 985). The Respondent adds that the Claimants\u2019 investments were \"self sufficient\", in particular after 2005, referring to the following statement in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial (see *ibid.* *,* para. 941, quoting Mem. at para. 83):\n\nHowever, prior to their Zimbabwean businesses being affected by the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme, there was by and large enough cash generated by the businesses for them to be self-financing.\n\n244.\n\nIn its Rebutter, the Respondent asserted that the Claimants had failed to prove and Indeed were \"Incapable of proving that any funds from outside Zimbabwe, from Germany or from Switzerland, ever trickled down to contribute to the Zimbabwean economy\". The Respondent continued as follows:\n\n... As a complex railroad switching station of the world\u2019s largest cities, many incoming tracks can be switched onto myriad outgoing tracks of financial flow. It is possible that any input Claimants were to prove having made at the top of this infernal machine never reached Zimbabwe.\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that it cannot be considered to have consented to this.\n\nd) Claims by Shareholders\n-------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants are Invoking \"Indirect claims\" (i.e., \"claims in which a shareholder requests compensation for damages resulting from a measure that was directed exclusively against the rights of the company in which It holds shares\") (see Resp. Skel., para. 69; Rejoinder, paras. 963-977) because the Impugned measures were directed against the Zimbabwean Companies, not their shareholders, and, as such, the Claimants do not have standing under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (see Rejoinder, paras. 207, 963-965, 967-971 and 977).\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s theory of \"Indirect claims\" appears to be drawn from a discussion published by Professor Gabriel Bottini on treaty claims advanced by shareholders. The issue was defined by Professor Bottini as follows (see G. Bottini, *\"Indirect Claims under the ICSID Convention\",* (2008) 29 U. Pa. J. Int'l L\" p. 565, R-55, RLEX-18):\n\nWhenever the host state adopts measures that directly affect shareholders' rights, such as the right to receive any declared dividend or to participate in shareholders meetings, it is undisputed that under international law either the shareholder, if it has direct access to an international procedure, or its national state through diplomatic protection, will have standing to claim against the measures. The problem arises, however, when the contested measure affects only the rights of the company because, in any event, it will generally also affect the economic interests of its shareholders measures.\n\nFor the purposes of this Article, an indirect claim (or an indirect action) is defined as a claim in which a shareholder requests compensation for damages resulting from a measure that was directed exclusively against the rights of the company in which it holds shares. As will become readily apparent, however, one of the most difficult tasks in this domain is determining whose rights are the ones really affected, notwithstanding the allegation of the shareholder-claimant (who will always argue that it is invoking its own rights and not those of the company). [emphasis added]\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent also argues, under the lens of its indirect claims objection, that owning shares through intermediary companies does not necessarily constitute an investment in Zimbabwe because an intermediary company \"might not use the assets of its parent company to realize its own investment but rather possibly funds generated by itself\u2019 (see Rejoinder, para. 966).\n\ne) Indirect Claims\n------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice **(\"ICJ\"),** and in particular *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co., Ltd. (Belgium/Spain)*  ***(\"Barcelona Traction\")*** (see 5 February 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, CLEX-153) in support of its position on indirect claims. The Respondent refers to the following statement by the ICJ that, under international law, a company has a distinct personality from its shareholders and because of this separation a company cannot be held responsible for the actions of its shareholders and *vice versa*(see Rejoinder, para. 969, quoting *Barcelona Traction,* para. 47, CLEX-153):\n\n[A] wrong done to a company frequently causes prejudice to its shareholders. But the mere fact that damage is sustained by both company and shareholder does not imply that both are entitled to claim compensation.... Thus whenever a shareholder\u2019s interests are harmed by an act done to the company, it is to the latter that he must look to institute appropriate action; for although two separate entities may have suffered from the same wrong, it is only one entity whose rights have been infringed.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the case of *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo)*  ***(\"Diallo\")***(see ICJ, Judgment on the Merits, 30 November 2010, CLEX-365) in which Guinea brought a claim on behalf of one of its nationals who had invested in Congo through two locally incorporated entities. The Respondent states that the ICJ also declined jurisdiction in that case on the basis that a distinction must be made between the companies and the shareholders for purposes of a claim (see Rejoinder, para. 970).\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent invoked Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the proposition that shareholders are entitled to bring a claim before the Centre only in exceptional cases, such as when there is consent that a locally incorporated entity is treated as a national of another State for the purposes of Convention. The Respondent submitted that this is not the case here, as neither the German nor the Swiss BIT expressly allows shareholders to file claims on behalf of companies (see *ibid.* *,* para. 971).\n\nf) Indirect Shareholdings\n-------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that the Claimants are only \"remotely connected\" to the Zimbabwean Companies (see Rebutter, para. 215; Resp. PHB, para. 163).\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, in *Enron,* the tribunal stated that \"there is a need to establish a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected company\" (see Rejoinder, para. 973 and Rebutter, para. 210, quoting *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*  *(**\"Enron\"**)* (see ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (Ancillary Claim), 14 January 2004, para. 52, CLEX-207). The Respondent takes the position that this is precisely the point here, that Zimbabwe\u2019s declarations of Interest in\"new\" Investments to develop the economy did not extend its consent to \"an Ill-defined, non-specific, nebulous maze of holdings ultimately owned or controlled by nobody knows whom or what \u2018dormant\u2019 off-shore company. Even If a \u2018smile\u2019 were proven, or suspected, it is neither an Invitation - having occurred after the acquisition of the holding - or consent and these claims should be considered Inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and the scope of the legal system protecting those holdings\" (see Rejoinder, para. 974; Rebutter, para. 212). Thus, the Respondent frames the real issue here as the fact, in its view, that the Claimants only have the most remote connection to the affected companies (see Rebutter, para. 215; Resp. PHB, para. 163).\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the conclusion reached by the tribunal in *Standard Chartered,* that \"an Indirect chain of ownership linking a British company to debt by a Tanzanian creditor does not in itself confer the status of Investor under the UK-Tanzanla BIT\" (see Rebutter, para. 216, quoting *Standard Chartered,* para. 200, RLEX-19). The Respondent concludes that the Claimants have not proved their Investment.\n\n(iii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-------------------------\n\na) The *Salini* Test\n--------------------\n\n255.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants took the position that, as there is no definition of \"Investment\" in the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is \"primarily required to focus on what has been agreed by the Contracting Parties to the BITs\" (see Mem., para. 1061). The Claimants acknowledged the \"considerable body of case law which considers that in order for an Investment to be an Investment for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it must also fulfill the criteria in the *Salini Test*(see Mem., para. 1063), but cautioned that the *\"Salini* criteria\" are \"mere yardsticks\" to assist indetermining whether there has been an Investment for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and are not jurisdictional criteria (see Cl. Skel., para. 20; Cl. PHB, para. 24). The Claimants have referred to several ICSID cases insupport of this proposition (see\u00a0*Biwater Gauff* *(Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*  ***(\"Biwater\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, paras. 312, 316-318, CLEX-233; *Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, para. 43, CLEX-245; *Ambiente Ufficio S.P.A. and others v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"Ambiente Ufficio\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction & Admissibility, 8 February 2013, paras. 479 and 480, CLEX-415). In *Ambiente Ufficio,* where the tribunal stated (see\u00a0*Ambiente Ufficio,* para. 479, CLEX-415):\n\n... The preceding analysis has also made clear that the present tribunal endorses the view that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention should not be subjected to an unduly restrictive interpretation. Hence, the *Salini* criteria, if useful at all, must not be conceived of as expressing jurisdictional requirements *strictu sensu.*\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants state that their contribution consisted of know-how, capital funding and management (see Cl. Skel., para. 21; Cl. PHB, para. 25), as borne out by the Claimants\u2019 testimony, summarized as follows (see Cl. PHB, para. 25):\n\n... Elisabeth stated that forestry was the family\u2019s main business in Europe before they acquired the Border Estate. R\u00fcdiger confirmed that his and Elisabeth\u2019s respective families had been Involved in forestry and farming for many generations before Investing in Zimbabwe. This know-how came with the Claimants to Zimbabwe and it is self-evident that it was applied to the three Estates. Elisabeth and R\u00fcdiger confirmed that the money to purchase the Forrester Estate came from Elisabeth, and Heinrich\u2019s written evidence is that Elisabeth provided the Loans. The Claimants\u2019 witnesses were not questioned inregard to the capital contributions to Border or Makandi, but Heinrich\u2019s and R\u00fcdiger\u2019s written evidence is that capital contributions were made inregard to Border and Makandi. In addition, R\u00fcdiger and Heinrich confirmed their prior evidence that they were deeply Involved in the management of the three Estates.... [citations omitted]\n\n257.\n\nThey also submit that Zimbabwe has recognized their contribution to the economic development of Zimbabwe, referring to the following statements made by senior government officials (see Cl. Skel., para. 22, quoting C-477, C-496 and C-221; see also Surrejoinder, paras. 155, 156, 157; Cl. PHB, para. 26):\n\n[T]he seizure of commercial land was contributing to the country\u2019s high Inflation rate... If you invade a coffee, tea, cocoa, wheat or a fruit farm what you are doing is to undermine the productive capacity of this economy, therefore causing Inflation. [Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Gideon Gono, October 2005]\n\nIt was remarkable to witness a good example of effective land utilization on your property. We would like to encourage you to continue this splendid task which is the basis of economic development of our country. [Senior Civil Servant of the Ministry of Lands, Mr. T.T.H. Muguti, November 1991]\n\nThe protection and preservation of Indigenous forests, found in most parts of the country and especially in Matabeleland North and the Midlands Provinces, and the properly administered exploitation of the exotic timber plantations of Manicaland [location of Border], are matters of great national importance... It employs some 16,000 people. The industry accounts for 3% of the GDP. [Zimbabwe land audit finding in relation to forestry]\n\n258.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants say that their contribution is self-evident from the number of people that the Claimants employ, the foreign exchange they earn from export sales, and inregard to Border the nature of the products they produce (e.g. sawn timber for construction). They also note that maize is grown for domestic consumption and that the only time they were unable to grow maize for the commercial market was during a period when the sale price was set at below the cost of production (see Cl. Skel., para. 22; Cl. PHB, para. 26; see also Heinrich I, paras. 216-225).\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Minister Mutasa has a predilection to view all foreign Investment in unfavourable terms and harbours a deep prejudice against white people, as evidenced by his testimony, and that these factors rather than any actual knowledge rooted in fact form the basis for his views as to the Claimants\u2019 contribution to the economic development of Zimbabwe (see Cl. PHB, para. 27).\n\n260.\n\nAs regards the commerclallty of the Claimants\u2019 Investment, the Claimants submit that most Investments have a commercial element to them and that under the full *Salini* test, regularity of profit and return is not only consistent with the concept of Investment but is required (see Surrejoinder, para. 161). The Claimants distinguish the case *of Joy Mining* from the present case, noting that *Joy Mining* Involved a standard commercial (supply) contract (a one-off transaction) as opposed to the Claimants multi-year investments, which have Included the building of lasting Infrastructure such as dams, Irrigation network, roads, curing sheds for tobacco, 95 tractors, combine harvesters, trucks and the Charter Estate sawmill (see Cl. Skel., para. 23; Surrejoinder, paras. 162-164; Cl. PHB, para. 28).\n\n261.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that their success was not guaranteed, noting that variation inprice and weather are risks that were faced by their investments inagriculture and timber production. The Claimants also reject the premise asserted by the Respondent that the Claimants faced no risk because they undertook due diligence before they Invested in-Zimbabwe and that they benefited from \"Rhodesian-style\" absolute full security (see Surrejoinder, paras. 168-169; Cl. PHB, para. 29). The Claimants refer to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment as evidence of risk and the success or failure of the Forrester Estate as evidence of risk of non-repayment of the loans extended by Elisabeth (see Cl. Skel., para. 24).\n\nb) Local Assets, Local Investment\n---------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants affirm that they plead their claims on the basis that their investments Include the shares that they directly and Indirectly own in the Zimbabwean Companies, as well as the underlying assets and operations of those companies (see Surrejoinder, para. 71). Border also affirms that it claims on the basis that its Investments Include the shares in the other Border Claimants, as well as the underlying assets of those companies. Hangani pleads its claim on the basis that its investments include the Border Properties that it directly owns. Border International pleads its claim on the basis that its investments Include the stock that it directly owns (see Surrejoinder, para. 72).\n\n263.\n\nIn their Surrejoinder, the Claimants recalled the following background to their respective claims (see Surrejoinder, paras. 74-75):\n\n74. Interms of the background facts to this issue, it will be recalled that the von Pezold Claimants (and ultimately Elisabeth), control the Zimbabwean Companies and the underlying assets through a combination of legal control and factual control. The legal control is through their indirect shareholdings in the Zimbabwean Companies. The factual control exists because through Heinrich they manage the businesses of the Zimbabwean Companies, and Heinrich, Elisabeth, and R\u00fcdiger hold seats on the boards of the Zimbabwean Companies.\n\n75. The von Pezold Claimants acquired their shareholdings in the Zimbabwean Companies for the purpose of acquiring the Zimbabwean Properties that make up the Forrester, Border and Makandi Estates and the business activities with which those companies are associated, in doing so, the von Pezold Claimants made investments into Zimbabwe, [footnotes omitted]\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimants note that the term \"investment\" is neither defined nor limited under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. They further state that there is no restriction in Article 25(1) that would prevent the underlying assets of a company being classed as an investment of the shareholders. Turning to the BITs, the Claimants state that the definition of investment in each BIT is drafted in the widest possible terms, comprising assets of every kind, including moveable and immoveable property, shares, claims to money and any performance having an economic value (or, in the case of the German BIT, any performance under a contract having economic value) (see Surrejoinder, paras. 79-80).\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimants note that there is a distinction between domestic corporate law (and concepts of veil piercing) and international law applicable to investment disputes, referring to *Total SA. v. Argentine Republic*  ***(Total)***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 August 2006, CLEX-406), where an ICSID tribunal found, for the purpose of its jurisdiction, that it was immaterial that the assets and rights which were alleged to have been injured belonged to Argentine companies. Thus, the Claimants submit that the position under public international law is that if, as a matter of fact, a shareholder controls the company that owns the assets in issue, public international law will consider those underlying assets to be the investments of the shareholder46. According to the Claimants, there is nothing in the Swiss or German BIT to contradict this position (see Surrejoinder, paras. 83-85).\n\nThe Claimants discuss three awards in detail in support of their view: *Total,* CLEX-406; *Mr. Franz Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation,* SCC, Award, 7 July 1998, CLEX-398 (where the tribunal found the investments in question to be investments within the meaning of the BIT because they were controlled by the claimant); and *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt*  ***(Siag),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 April 2007, CLEX-407 (where the tribunal found the investment in question to be an investment within the meaning of the BIT based on indicia of control by the claimants).\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the case of *Tradex* relied upon by the Respondent, does not in fact support the Respondent\u2019s position that the assets owned by the Zimbabwean Companies are not the von Pezolds\u2019 assets as the tribunal never addressed the situation where the claimant Investor controls the company and the underlying assets, and uses that company as a vehicle through which to make or acquire assets (see Surrejoinder, para. 106; Cl. Skel., n. 16).\n\nc) Origin of Capital\n--------------------\n\n267.\n\nThe Claimants state that they did use capital that originated from outside Zimbabwe when they purchased the share capital in the Zimbabwean Companies, and that subsequent Investments into the Estates have been a combination of reinvesting profits and provision of some debt, including the loans extended by Elisabeth from her own funds, held outside of Zimbabwe (see Surrejoinder, paras. 131-132).\n\n268.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that nothing in Article 25(1) Imposes an origin of capital requirement and that other ICSID tribunals have so held (see*Tokios Tok\u00e9les v. Ukraine*  ***(\"Tokios Tok\u00e9les\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, para. 73, CLEX-401, para. 73; *Fedax,* paras. 29 and 41, CLEX-397).\n\n269.\n\nAs regards the BITs, the Claimants submit that such a requirement would be Inconsistent with the object and purpose of the BITs, which they say is to encourage foreign Investment in-Zimbabwe, and that there is similarly no requirement in the BITs that, in order for investments to benefit from protection, the Investments must have been acquired through the use of capital that originates from outside Zimbabwe. The Claimants refer again to the case of *Tokios Tok\u00e9les,* where the tribunal rejected Ukraine\u2019s arguments in connection with the origin of capital vis-\u00e0-vis Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and the Lithuania-Ukraine BIT, which contains a similarly broad definition of Investments as the Swiss and German BITs. The Claimants Insist that it is \"the Investment itself that must be in the territory of Zimbabwe, not the capital used to acquire It\" (see Surrejoinder, para. 140).\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimants submit that *Tradex* does not support the Respondent\u2019s argument but rather contradicts It, as the *Tradex* tribunal held that so long as the capital was used for the benefit of the investment in Albania it did not need to flow into Albania (see Surrejoinder, para. 143, citing *Tradex,* paras. 118-119, RLEX-11). The Claimants also note that the *Tradex* tribunal was not required to decide the issue of capital that does not enter the host State but which is used to acquire shares in a company in the host State, but that this issue was considered by the tribunal in *Fedax,* which confirmed that such a transaction would not prevent the shares of the local company from being an investment covered by the BIT (see Surrejoinder, para. 147, citing *Fedax,* para. 41, CLEX-179).\n\nd) Claims by Shareholders\n-------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent in fact raises two separate grounds for objection under its indirect claims objection: (i) indirect claims, being claims asserted by the Claimants on behalf of the Zimbabwean Companies; and (ii) claims asserted by the Claimants on the basis of indirect shareholdings in companies. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 observation in this regard and the Tribunal has therefore split the Respondent\u2019s objection(s) according to the Claimants\u2019 proposed approach.\n\n272.\n\nFinally, although the Respondent appears to raise this objection (or these objections) in respect of both the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants, the Claimants note that the point regarding indirect shareholdings does not appear to relate to the Border Claimants, as only one of those companies (Border) holds shares in other companies (the other two Border Claimants) and those shares are held directly (see Surrejoinder, para. 223; C-56).\n\n(i) Indirect Claims\n-------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the measures in question were directed at both the von Pezold Claimants and the Zimbabwean Companies and had the effect of directly expropriating: (i) the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 investments owned through the Zimbabwean Companies; and (ii) the Zimbabwean Companies\u2019 properties. Thus, the Claimants submit that they are asserting direct rights. The Claimants also contend that the measures had the effect of indirectly expropriating the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 shares in the Zimbabwean Companies, causing them loss (see Cl. Skel., para. 26; Surrejoinder, para. 175). The Claimants state that the foregoing applies *mutatis mutandis* to the Border Claimants (see Rebutter, para. 176; Cl. Skel., para. 26).\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants reason that as the Claimants\u2019 investments included the underlying assets of the Zimbabwean Companies, the measures must have been directed at the Claimants and they therefore have standing. The Claimants also reason that even if the measures were only directed against the Zimbabwean Companies, the effect of those measures on the Claimants is such that they still have standing to pursue their claims (see Cl. Skel., para. 27; Surrejoinder, para. 179). The Claimants take the position, on the basis of *Total*(see*Total,* para. 80, CLEX-406), that the same measures may cause losses to both a company and to its shareholders.\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimants note that, while the Respondent advances its objection regarding Indirect claims under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, its arguments are primarily based on the jurisprudence of the ICJ. To the extent the Respondent advances its argument under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention as well, the Claimants aver that the Respondent has misunderstood this provision and assert that it does not address the issue of shareholders bringing claims and does not restrict shareholders from bringing claims inregard to measures directed against their companies or them (see Surrejoinder, paras. 181-186).\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the ICJ jurisprudence on which the Respondent relies is Inapposite because it concerns the law of diplomatic protection of shareholders, not the protection of shareholders under Investment protection treaties. The Claimants aver that Investment treaty tribunals have consistently held that the law of diplomatic protection is Inapplicable to claims pursuant to Investment treaties, and that shareholders may bring claims for the losses they have suffered that arise from measures directed at their companies (see Cl. Skel., para. 28; Surrejoinder, paras. 187-213).\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimants refer (see Surrejoinder, para. 214) in particular to the following discussion of *Barcelona Traction* in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"CMS\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, paras. 43, 44, 45 and 48, CLEX-203)47:\n\nHowever, Counsel for the Claimant are also right when affirming that this case was concerned only with the exercise of diplomatic protection in that particular triangular setting, and involved what the Court considered to be a relationship attached to municipal law, but it did not rule out the possibility of extending protection to shareholders in a corporation in different contexts. Specifically, the International Court of Justice was well aware of the new trends in respect of the protection of foreign investors under the 1965 Convention and the bilateral investment treaties related thereto.\n\nBarcelona Traction is therefore not directly relevant to the present dispute, although it marks the beginning of a fundamental change of the applicable concepts under international law and State practice. Inpoint of fact, the Elettronica Sicula decision evidences that the International Court of Justice itself accepted, some years later, the protection of shareholders of a corporation by the State of their nationality in spite of the fact that the affected corporation had a corporate personality under the defendant State's legislation.\n\nDiplomatic protection itself has been dwindling in current international law, as the State of nationality is no longer considered to be protecting its own interest in the claim but that of the individual affected. To some extent, diplomatic protection is intervening as a residual mechanism to be resorted to in the absence of other arrangements recognizing the direct right of action by individuals. It is precisely this kind of arrangement that has come to prevail under international law, particularly in respect of foreign Investments, the paramount example being that of the 1965 Convention.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds no bar in current International law to the concept of allowing claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned, not even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders. Although it is true, as argued by the Republic of Argentina, that this is mostly the result of lex specialis and specific treaty arrangements that have so allowed, the fact is that lex specialis in this respect is so prevalent that it can now be considered the general rule, certainly in respect of foreign investments and increasingly inrespect of other matters. To the extent that customary International law or generally the traditional law of international claims might have followed a different approach - a proposition that is open to debate - then that approach can be considered the exception.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to the decisions of the tribunals in *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"Siemens\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, CLEX-402; *Garni Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States*  ***(\"Garni\"),***  UNCITRAL, Final Award, 15 November 2004, CLEX-403; *Total,* CLEX-406; *BG Group Pic. v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"BG Group\"),***  UNCITRAL, Final Award, 24 December 2007, CLEX-231; and *Roslnvest Co UK Ltd v. Russian Federation*  ***(\"Roslnvest\"),*** SCC 079/2005, Final Award, 2010, CLEX-251. See Rebutter, paras. 215-219.\n\n278.\n\nAs a final point, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should bear inmind that the Zimbabwean Companies have no remedy under Zimbabwean law to recover compensation for the land that has been expropriated or to object to the expropriation itself. The Claimants state that this flows from the fact that the 2005 Constitutional Amendment removed the right of the former owners of land that had been expropriated to object to the expropriation in court. Thus, if successful, the Respondent\u2019s arguments would have the effect of denying the shareholders any remedy whatsoever (see Surrejoinder, paras. 220-221).\n\n(ii) Indirect Shareholdings\n---------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimants note that this objection can only apply to the von Pezold Claimants and consider this to be an objection to the von Pezold Claimants bringing claims in relation to their shares in the Zimbabwean Companies in circumstances where there are companies Interposed between them and the Zimbabwean Companies.\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the term \"Investment\" is neither defined nor limited in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, but rather is defined in Article 1 of the BITs in the \"widest possible terms\". The Claimants argue that there is nothing in the BITs to prevent the indirect shareholdings in the Zimbabwean Companies from being classed as Investments (see Surrejoinder, paras. 228-230).\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimants contend that ICSID jurisprudence supports the Claimants\u2019 conclusion, referring in particular to the cases of *Siemens, loannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*  ***(Kardassopoulos)***(see ICSID Case No. ARB05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 July 2007, CLEX-227), and *Mobil* (see Surrejoinder, paras. 231-239). The Claimants quote the following language from the *Siemens* Decision on Jurisdiction (see *Siemens,* para. 137, CLEX-402):\n\nThe Tribunal has conducted a detailed analysis of the references in the Treaty to \u2018investment\u2019 and \u2018investor\u2019. The Tribunal observes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the Treaty. The definition of \u2018investment\u2019 is very broad. An investment is any kind of asset considered to be such under the law of the Contracting Party where the Investment has been made. The specific categories of investment included in the definition are included as examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters were careful to use the words \u2018not exclusively\u2019 before listing the categories of \u2018particularly\u2019 included investments. One of the categories consists of \u2018shares, rights of participation in companies and other types of participation incompanies\u2019. The plain meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German shareholder are protected under the Treaty. The Treaty does not require that there be no interposed companies between the Investment and the ultimate owner of the company. Therefore, a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes Indirect investments.\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimants aver that *Enron* is not good authority for the Respondent\u2019s assertion that indirect shareholdings are not investments under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, noting that the *Enron* tribunal permitted the claim of minority indirect shareholders. The Claimants set out their analysis of the *Enron* tribunal\u2019s conclusions as follows (see Surrejoinder, paras. 244-246):\n\n244. The Enron tribunal disagreed and held that indirect shareholdings were not precluded from coverage under the bilateral investment treaty. Indoing so, the Enron tribunal considered that the issue is whether or not the investor (shareholder) is too remote from the company which is the subject of the measures that have also caused losses to the shareholder. The Enron tribunal considered this to be a function of the extent of the host State\u2019s consent to arbitration, which in turn it considered to be a function of whether or not the State had consented to the investment. In this regard the Enron tribunal said:\n\n\"If consent has been given in respect of an investor and an Investment, it can be reasonably concluded that the claims brought by such investor are admissible under the treaty. If the consent cannot be considered as extending to another Investor or Investment, these other claims should then be considered inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and the scope of the legal system protecting that investment.\"\n\n245. However, if Enron considered that consent to arbitration was the relevant test then it should have considered the dispute resolution provisions of the United States- Argentina bilateral investment treaty - it did not do this.\n\n246. In any event, it is apparent that the Enron tribunal also considered that another matter was also of equal importance. That other matter was whether or not it could be said that as a matter of public international law, Enron and Pondersosa were the owners of the shares in TGS. Incoming to this conclusion it is evident that the Enron tribunal did not consider ownership to be a question of domestic law (under Argentinian law, EPCA, CIESA and EDIDESCA were the owners of TGS, not Enron and Pondersosa - see the diagram in para 241 above). The relevant passage from the decision is as follows:\n\n\"The conclusion that follows is that in the present case the participation of the Claimants was specifically sought and that they are thus Included within the consent to arbitration given by the Argentine Republic. The Claimants cannot be considered to be only remotely connected to the legal arrangements governing the privatization, they are beyond any doubt the owners of the investment made and their rights are protected under the Treaty as clearly established treaty-rights and not merely contractual rights related to some intermediary. The fact that the investment was made through CIESA and related companies does not in anyway alter this conclusion.\"... [citations omitted]\n\n283.\n\nReturning to the case at hand, the Claimants submit that the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Investments in the Zimbabwean Companies are not \"portfolio Investments\", but rather investments which the von Pezold Claimants themselves manage and control, Identifying the following Indicia of management and control (see Surrejoinder, para. 247):\n\n\u2022 legal control of the Zimbabwean Companies through their Indirect shareholdings;\n\n\u2022 factual control of the Zimbabwean Companies exercised through Heinrich von Pezold;\n\n\u2022 Heinrich, Elisabeth and R\u00fcdiger hold seats on the boards of the Zimbabwean Companies;\n\n\u2022 All companies between the von Pezold Claimants and the Zimbabwean Companies are controlled by the same means;\n\n\u2022 Respondent has acknowledged the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 ownership of the shares in the Zimbabwean Companies in its court orders, in its Land Audit Committee Reports and in the papers of its Executive sitting in Cabinet.\n\n(iv) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n----------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThere is considerable jurisprudence to support the proposition that, although the primary task of an ICSID tribunal is to establish whether an investment exists inaccordance with the specific words of the relevant treaty, there may nonetheless be certain inherent characteristics of an Investment which assist a tribunal in this task. This is so whether under the ICSID Convention or otherwise.\n\n285.\n\nWhatever the position may be on *Salini* as regards the elements to be satisfied, the Tribunal finds that it is rather less clear that the *Salini* test is the authoritative statement on those characteristics. Indeed, there seems to be a move away from *Salini to* a simpler test Involving contribution, duration and risk. All of these characteristics are satisfied in the present case. Both the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants have made a clear contribution both financially and interms of expertise and time Invested inmanaging the assets. The Respondent has not intimated that duration is an issue, but in any event this criterion is clearly satisfied. The Respondent\u2019s argument that, as a result of careful due diligence, there was no risk involved in the investments cannot be sustained and finds no support either on the evidence available in this specific case or the general jurisprudence on this topic. It is evident that the present case does not involve a \"commercial transaction\" (such as a sale of goods) of the type that this \"Inherent characteristics\" test is meant to distinguish. The Respondent\u2019s *Salini* argument is therefore dismissed.\n\n286.\n\nThe jurisprudence is uncertain as to whether a contribution to economic development of the State is required as part of the Investment criteria. However, given the employment provided, contribution to the economy and know-how involved in the Investment, it is clear that any such criterion would also be satisfied in the present case.\n\n287.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent\u2019s \"local assets\" argument, the Tribunal is satisfied that the fact that locally incorporated companies were used as part of the Investment structure does not undermine the foreign nature of the investment in this case and there is no basis here for denying jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.\n\n288.\n\nThere is no origin of capital requirement in the BITs or under the ICSID Convention; therefore this objection is also dismissed. In any case, it is clear that funding from outside Zimbabwe was Invested by the Claimants and/or loaned to the Zimbabwean Companies, together with the reinvestment of locally-generated profit. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the von Pezold Claimants have established that qualifying Investments were made in-Zimbabwe. The Tribunal dlcusses below the Parties\u2019 respective positions on claims by shareholders under the ICSID Convention and the BITs.\n\n(2) The BITs\n------------\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the disputes under the BITs on several grounds.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the BITs require an Investment to be \"made\" as opposed to just passively held (i.e., in a portfolio of holdings) (see Resp. Skel., paras. 46ff; Resp. PHB, para. 39), referring in particular to the language of Articles 2 and 9 of the German BIT, which refer to \"Investments made\" in the context of the promotion and protection of \"Investments\" and provide that the German BIT applies to all Investments \"made inaccordance with the laws of\u2019 the host State, and Article 2 of the Swiss BIT, which provides that the Swiss BIT applies to all Investments \"made inaccordance with the laws of\u2019 the host State (see Rebutter, paras. 87-88, 106-107).\n\n291.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon the ICSID case of *Standard Chartered* insupport of its position that, in order to benefit from protection, Investments must be actively made. The *Standard Chartered* tribunal held that the UK-Tanzanla BIT required an Investment to be made by, not simply held by, an Investor, which meant that the investor had to have contributed actively to the Investment (see *Standard Charterd Bank v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/2, Award, 2 November 2012, para. 257, RLEX-19 *(\"Standard Chartered\")).* The *Standard Chartered* tribunal ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, having found that the putative investor had not made the Investment inquestion:\n\n230. Having considered the ordinary meaning of the BIT\u2019S provision for ICSID arbitration when a dispute arises between a Contracting State to the BIT and a national of the other Contracting State concerning an Investment \"of\" the latter set out in Article 8(1) of the UK-Tanzania BIT, the context of that provision and the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal interprets the BIT to require an active relationship between the investor and the Investment. To benefit from Article 8(1)\u2019s arbitration provision, a claimant must demonstrate that the investment was made at the claimant\u2019s direction, that the claimant funded the investment or that the claimant controlled the investment in an active and direct manner. Passive ownership of shares in a company not controlled by the claimant where that company in turn owns the investment is not sufficient.\n\n231. The Tribunal is not persuaded that an \"investment of\" a company or an Individual implies only the abstract possession of shares in a company that holds title to some piece of property.\n\n232. Rather, for an investment to be \"of\" an investor in the present context, some activity of investing is needed, which Implicates the claimant\u2019s control over the investment or an action of transferring something of value (money, know-how, contacts, or expertise) from one treaty-country to the other.\n\n292.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, like the UK-Tanzania BIT, the German and Swiss BITs also require a \"new\" or \"active\" Investment that makes a contribution to the host State\u2019s economy in order to benefit from their protection. The Respondent emphasizes that the German and Swiss BITs are bilateral, not one-way, and refers to the following reasoning of the *Standard Chartered* tribunal (see Rebutter, para. 63):\n\n268. Could one imagine an executive in SCB Hong Kong deciding to purchase the IPTL loan with the expectation that it would get the protection of the BIT between the UK and Tanzania? Perhaps under that scenario, the UK-Tanzania BIT could be said to encourage the investment.\n\n269. However, such encouragement works only inone direction. The UK-Tanzania BIT imposes no liability on Hong Kong or China to protect Investors from Tanzania, by providing mutual benefits to Tanzanians investing in Hong Kong. Moreover, the decision insuch a case would have been made by someone in Hong Kong, not in Britain, the Contracting State under the relevant BIT.\n\n270. In the absence of text in the BIT expressing a contrary intent and on a record indicating no Involvement or control of the UK national overthe investment, it would be unreasonable to read the BIT to permit a UK national with subsidiaries all around the world to claim entitlement to the UK-Tanzania BIT protection for each and every one of the investments around the world held by these daughter or granddaughter entities. The BIT preamble says \"reciprocal protection\" and \"reciprocal\" must have some meaning.\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent concluded in its Post-Hearing Brief, on the basis of Mr. Nyaguse\u2019s testimony, that the Claimants came to hold their investments in Zimbabwe in the *Standard Chartered* sense, constituting mere assets \"held\" and not protected investments \"made\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 149).\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent also alleges that the von Pezold Claimants have not proven their beneficial ownership of the Investments or the portion they each own of the Zimbabwean Companies48(see Resp. Skel., para. 143).\n\nAlthough the Respondent addresses this issue as a merits question relating to damages, as opposed to a question of jurisdiction, if successful, the effect of the Respondent\u2019s objection would be to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims. Accordingly, it is addressed here.\n\n295.\n\nThe particular legal basis for this objection is not entirely clear. The Claimants appear to consider this to be an Independent ground for objection to jurisdiction although, as Indicated above, it has some relevance to the Respondent\u2019s position regarding the Border Claimants\u2019 standing to claim under the Swiss BIT and the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 claims over the assets of the Zlmbawean Companies. As an Independent ground for objection to jurisdiction, the objection is encapsulated in the following paragraphs from the Rejoinder (see Rejoinder, paras. 986-987):\n\nTo the extent that Claimants have hidden behind their nebulous, complex, obscure, holding structures, and abstained from proving the exact holder and amount of each stakeholder and given the fact that R\u00fcdiger is among the key beneficiaries, trustees and ultimate decision-makers, the entirety of the von Pezold and Border Estate claims should be dismissed as no proof of each investment has been submitted and one of the Parent Claimants does not have any legal basis for his Claims and consequently there is no certain amount to be considered under the Swiss BIT.\n\nIn light of the above, not only must all Claimants\u2019 claims be dismissed under the German BIT but also under the Swiss BIT as Claimants have failed to prove the identity and holding that might otherwise benefit from consideration of hypothetical protection under the Swiss BIT.\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent further stated the following in its Rebutter (see Rebutter, para. 116; Resp. PHB, para. 219):\n\nAs set out in Paragraph 986 of Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, there is no determinable amount of claims to be considered under the Swiss BIT as Claimant R\u00fcdiger is not Swiss and the intermingled holdings, control, beneficiaries (named and unnamed), trustee and ultimate decision-makers are not determinable, so Claimants\u2019 demands under the Swiss BIT must be rejected.\n\n297.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent argued that while the Claimants have focused on the \"theoretical grounds of\u2018control\u2019\", the Respondent has challenged the factual ground of who controls what, and the Claimants have failed to prove their alleged ownership and control. The Respondent referred, by way of example, to the following statement in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial insupport of its view that the Claimants have still not proven ownership (see Resp. PHB, para. 171 and 222):\n\nThe working capital of their investments may be a mix of their own money, finance from other Investors, commercial banks and government owned development finance institutions that are mandated to Invest indeveloping markets.\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Forrester Water Rights are not investments because they are neither \"rights *in rem\",* pursuant to Article 1(a) of the German BIT, nor \"business concessions under public law\", pursuant to Article 1(e) of the German BIT (see Rejoinder, para. 232). The Respondent notes that Article 1(a) of the German BIT defines investment as \"movable and immovable property as well as any other rights *in rem* such as mortgages, liens and pledges\". The Respondent submits that the reference to *in rem* rights in this provision should be interpreted as follows (see Rejoinder, para. 232):\n\nTo understand the meaning given by the States to the phrase \"inrem\", one should use the example that follows such phrase in the definition\" mortgages, liens and pledges which are all derivative legal concepts of items affecting or related to a property that are used as a guarantee based on such property with the aim to alter such property until complete fulfillment of the obligation that gave raise [sic] to such right. By comparison, a right to use water on a property is nothing similar to that concept and cannot be qualified as a right in rem per Article 1(a) of the BIT.\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent also states that while, pursuant to Article 1(e) of the German BIT, a business concession may be comprised of rights to natural resources, this does not mean that all rights to natural resources constitute a business concession. Here, the Respondent argues that the Claimants cannot prove the existence of a business concession with respect to the use of water on the properties.\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there is no requirement under the BITs for an Investment to have been \"made\" and that a passive holding is sufficient to satisfy the definition of an Investment under each BIT (see Cl. Skel., para. 10; Cl. PHB, para. 36).\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimants distinguish the facts in *Standard Chartered* by reasoning that the tribunal\u2019s findings turned on its Interpretation of ambiguous wording in the dispute resolution clause in the UK-Tanzania BIT49, the use of the word \"made\" in the BIT, including in its definition of \"investment\", and the fact that the claimant had expressly disavowed that it controlled the subsidiary that held the investment (see Cl. Skel., para. 39; Cl. PHB, paras. 37-38).\n\nArticles 8(1) and 11 of the UK-Tanzania BIT read inrelevant part as follows, the \"ambiguity\" inemphasis:  \n Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as the \"Centre\") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an Investment of the latter in the territory of the former.  \n...  \n If the provision of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under International law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling Investments by Investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreements.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants note that, here, the von Pezold Claimants control the Zimbabwean Companies. The Claimants also note that there is no similar ambiguity in the language of the dispute resolution clause of the Swiss BIT as there was in the UK-Tanzania BIT, and the definition of \"Investment\" in the Swiss BIT does not refer to investments being \"made\". Although the language of the German BIT dispute resolution clause is similar to that of the dispute resolution clause in the UK-Tanzania BIT which posed a problem for the claimants in the *Standard Chartered* case, the Claimants emphasize that the definition of \"Investment\" in the German BIT does not refer to investments being \"made\". The Claimants argue that the use of the term \"owned\", incontradistinction to \"controlled\", in Article 3(1) of the German BIT, further Implies that passive Investment is covered50.\n\nThe Claimants note that the tribunal in *Standard Chartered* recognized that the word \"own\" connotes passive holding of investment. See Cl. Skel., n. 105; Cl. PHB, paras. 38-39; *Standard Chartered,* para. 223, RLEX-19.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, even If the analysis of the *Standard Chartered* tribunal is found to apply here, the Claimants have \"made\" Investments and have satisfied the criteria for the making of an Investment as set out by the tribunal in *Standard Chartered*(see Cl. Skel., p. 10; Cl. PHB, para. 40) in that they:\n\n\u2022 Decided to make the Investments (see Heinrich I, paras. 35 and 37; Heinrich and R\u00fcdiger von Pezold\u2019s Joint Witness Statement, para. 4);\n\n\u2022 Funded the Investments (see Cl. Skel., n. 107; Heinrich\u2019s I, paras. 263-278, 419, and 452-457);\n\n\u2022 Controlled the Investments (see Elisabeth I, paras. 1 and 16; R\u00fcdiger I, paras. 1,2 and 11; Heinrich I, paras. 1,3, 56, 58 and 488; Heinrich V, para. 65);\n\n\u2022 Managed the Investments (see Elisabeth I, paras. 1 and 16; R\u00fcdiger I, paras. 1,2 and 11; Heinrich I, paras. 1,3, 56, 58 and 488; Heinrich V, para. 65); and\n\n\u2022 Transferred something of value to acquire them.\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimants submit that nothing more than bare legal ownership is required by either BIT. They refer to the Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility in *Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. Russian Federation*  ***(\"Hulley Enterprises\")***(see UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (Energy Charter Treaty), *Interim* Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009, CLEX-362), in which the tribunal reviewed the plain text of the Energy Charter Treaty and found that it does not require more than simple legal ownership of shares for an Investment to qualify as a protected Investment. Following the approach to Interpretation set out in Article 31 of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*  ***(\"Vienna Convention\"),*** the tribunal confirmed that there was \"no indication whatsoever that the drafters of the Treaty Intended to limit ownership to \u2018beneficial\u2019 ownership\" (see*Hulley Enterprises,* para. 429). The Claimants apply the same principle to the present case.\n\n305.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that they have established their beneficial ownership through the provision of title deeds, share certificates and family trust deeds, all of which are supported by organograms (see Heinrich I, Appendix 1, C-18; C-63, C-52 and C-64 (organograms); Cl. PHB, para. 33). The Claimants note that this same evidence also states the percentage that each Claimant owned in the Zimbabwean Companies. The Claimants admit that the Investments are ultimately controlled by Elisabeth (see Cl. Skel., para. 33; Cl. PHB, para. 33), and that although Elisabeth stated in her testimony that she did not understand the details of the organograms, she confirmed that she, together with her family, own the Estates (see Tr. Day 2, p. 463, lines 11-15). The Claimants also note that Mr. Machaya admitted in his testimony that the Claimants owned the Investments at the time the pleaded causes of action accrued (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1461, Line 1 to p. 1462, line 1).\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there is nothing to Infer that the Contracting Parties to the German BIT Intended to give the term \"rights *in rem\"* in Article 1(a) a special meaning limited to rights *in rem* that are akin to \"mortgages, liens and pledges\". The Claimants note that the ordinary meaning of rights *in rem* are rights that are exercisable against the whole world in relation to property. The von Pezold Claimants note that the Forrester Water Rights attached to the land to which they related and gave the holder the exclusive use of public water covered by the right. The Claimants reason that the Forrester Water Rights were *in rem* rights, and as such covered by Article 1(a) of the German BIT, as they could be asserted against the whole world in relation to the water that they covered (see Cl. Skel., para. 35).\n\n307.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants also argue that the Forrester Water Rights are business concessions under public law within the meaning of Article 1 (e) because water is a natural resource and a Water Right gave the holder the right to extract and exploit water for business purposes (see Cl. Skel., para. 36). The Claimants note that a public law element of the concession is that it was granted pursuant to legislation, namely the Water Act 1976 (see Surrejoinder, para. 266).\n\n308.\n\nFinally, the von Pezold Claimants submit that the Forrester Water Rights are \"every kind of asset\" within the meaning of Article 1 of the German BIT, as they constitute compensable property under Zimbabwean law. The Claimants refer to s. 16(1)(c) of the Constitution, which required that the owner of \"property\" be compensated if his property was expropriated, and to the Water Act 1976, which required that the holder of a Water Right be compensated if the right was expropriated (see Cl. Skel., para. 37).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n309.\n\nArticle 11 of the German BIT provides that only disputes \"concerning an investment of [a] national or company [of a Contracting Party] in the territory of the [other] Contracting Party\" are protected. Similarly, Article 10 of the Swiss BIT provides that only disputes \"with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contract Party\" are protected. The issue here Is whether the Claimants\u2019 investments satisfy the definition of \"investment\" in each respective BIT.\n\n310.\n\nThe Swiss and German BITs each define \"investment\" as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Swiss BIT | German BIT |\n| Article 1 | Article 1 |\n| Definitions | Interpretation |\n| For the purpose of this Agreement: | For the purpose of this Agreement: |\n| (2) The term \"Investments\" shall include every kind of assets and particularly: (a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens, pledges; (b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies; (c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value; (d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, utility models, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications of origin), know-how and goodwill; | 1 the term \"investments\" comprises every kind of asset, in particular: a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem such as mortgages, liens and pledges; b) shares in companies and other kinds of Interests in companies; c) claims to money or to any performance under contract having an economic value; d) Intellectual property rights such as copyrights, patents, utility models, industrial designs, trade marks, trade names, trade and business secrets, technical processes, know-how, and goodwill; |\n| (e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law. A change in the form In which assets are invested does not affect their character as Investments. | e) business concessions under public law, including rights to search for, extract and exploit natural resources; and any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as Investments; |\n\n311.\n\nAd Article 1 (a) of the German Protocol further states that \"returns from the Investment, and, in the event of their reinvestment, the returns therefrom], shall enjoy the same protection as the Investment\" (CLEX-3).\n\n312.\n\nThe first ground of challenge under this heading is that the investments were not \"made\" by the Claimants, but were passively held. To the extent there is any requirement of an active role in the investment - of which the Tribunal is not convinced, given the definition of \"investment\" underthe Swiss and German BITs-the Tribunal considers that it is satisfied in the present case. It is evident that the Claimants actively control the investments and are not simply passive offshore shareholders, with no role in the business. The acquisition of the relevant shares was also actively pursued and would itself satisfy any requirement that the investment be \"made\".\n\n313.\n\nHaving reviewed *Standard Chartered* in the light of the BITs and factual matrix in Issue in this case, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 assessment that the *Standard Chartered* case is distinguishable both on the facts and the wording of the specific BITs, and therefore does not provide a reliable authority for this Tribunal. The Tribunal refers to the detailed comparative assessment of this case and the *Standard Chartered* case provided by the Claimants, summarized earlier in this Award (see above paras. 301-308).\n\n314.\n\nThe next ground of challenge is that the von Pezold Claimants have not proved beneficial ownership. The Tribunal can find no requirement that beneficial ownership be proven ineither the Swiss or German BITs, and sees no basis on which such a requirement should be read Into the BITs. In the present case, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have provided *prima facie* evidence of legal ownership which has not been rebutted and this is sufficient to establish jurisdiction.\n\n315.\n\nFinally, in relation to the Forrester Water Rights, these rights constitute part of the Investment, as an asset held by the von Pezold Claimants, as both a right *in rem* and a business concession under public law. The Tribunal notes, in this regard, that the very nature of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Investments in Zimbabwe to which their water rights are connected, being large scale agricultural operations, require access to water for Irrigation purposes. Indeed, it is Inconceivable that such operations could exist, let alone succeed, without reliable access to water.\n\n316.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the BITs.\n\n(3) The von Pezold Claims: One last issue\n-----------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nOne final issue remains for discussion: namely, to whom these investments belonged. This question arises because the von Pezold Claimants have brought their claims primarily in relation to loss suffered to investments held not by them personally, but by the locally-incorporated Zimbabwean Companies - an approach challenged by the Respondent. The only investments owned directly by the von Pezold Claimants are, strictly speaking, the shares they hold in the companies directly below them in their corporate organograms51. This issue becomes particularly significant in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s remedial jurisdiction, because the von Pezold Claimants claim not only for the Indirect expropriation of the value of their shares, but seek restitution of (or, in the alternative, compensation for) the Zimbabwean Properties - assets that they themselves have never directly held. Moreover, inseeking for the Tribunal to restore the *status quo ante* through an award of restitution, the von Pezold Claimants ask that these assets be returned not to their possession, but to the possession of the Zimbabwean Companies which directly held them prior to 2005. It is important to bear inmind that neither the Forrester Companies (see above, para. 120) nor the Makandi Companies (see above, para. 136) have brought claims in their own name; only the Border Claimants (see above, para. 12) have brought a claim in their own name.\n\nThe only other exception is the Forrester Loans, which monies were loaned directly by Elisabeth von Pezold to the Forrester Companies. As direct creditor in respect of those loans, Elisabeth von Pezold has a direct personal claim for their return.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondent argues that claims by foreign shareholders cannot encompass measures directed against a locally-incorporated company, nor loss incurred by that company. It submits that \"[N]either the German BIT nor the Swiss BIT expressly allows shareholders to file claims on behalf of companies. [...] [N]othing in the BIT states that such investment allows an investor to claim on behalf of a third party like a company\" (see Rejoinder, para. 971). The Respondent\u2019s submission amounts, ineffect, to a claim that the von Pezold Claimants lack *ius standi* to bring their claims before this Tribunal. The von Pezold Claimants, inresponse, have made clear that they do not seek to bring a claim on behalf of the Zimbabwean Companies (see Cl. Observations, paras. 71, 82, 175). Rather, they submit they are entitled to bring a claim for their own losses inrespect of what are, as a result of their \"control\" of the Zimbabwean Companies, their own Investments: \"[i]f, as a matter of fact, a shareholder controls the company that owns the assets in Issue, public International law will consider those underlying assets to be the Investments of the shareholder\" (see Cl. Observations, para. 85; see also Cl. Observations, para. 179: \"The Claimants claim for their own losses. The parties have already agreed that the same measure by a State may cause a loss to the company and also a separate (but equivalent) loss to the shareholders\").\n\n319.\n\nIt is true that, as the Respondent submits, international law traditionally tended to look unfavourably on shareholders bringing claims for damage to investments which they did not directly own. The well-known decision of the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction,* cited frequently by the Respondent, represents the high-water mark of this perspective (Case *Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Ltd (Belgium v. Spain),* 5 February 1970, CLEX-153). In that case, Belgium sought to bring a diplomatic protection claim on behalf of its nationals, who owned an 88% shareholding in the Canadian company Barcelona Traction, which inturn owned a number of Spanish subsidiaries allegedly mistreated by the Spanish government. The Court found that Belgium had no standing to bring a claim on behalf of the Belgian shareholders; the proper plaintiff was, rather, the Canadian company, whose rights had been more directly affected.\n\n320.\n\nThe *Barcelona Traction* case, however, was decided in the particular context of diplomatic protection: see\u00a0*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 August 2006, para. 78, CLEX-406. Indeed, the ICJ noted in its decision that a different approach might well apply through the \"considerable development\" of bilateral and multilateral treaties providing for the direct protection of foreign Investors (para. 90) (see also\u00a0*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo,* Preliminary Objections Judgment, ICJ, 24 May 2007, para. 91, RLEX-13). As the von Pezold Claimants observe, that proposition was tested before the ICJ in a subsequent case, *Elettronica Sicula Spa (ELSI) -* a case whose facts are somewhat similar to those of the present case *(Case concerning Elettronica Sicula Spa (ELSI); USA v. Italy (Judgment of 20 July 1989),* CLEX-172). *ELSI* concerned a claim by the United States for diplomatic protection of two American corporate shareholders, Raytheon and Machlett, Investors in an Italian company whose property had been requisitioned by the Italian government. Italy argued that the United States\u2019 claim (on behalf of Raytheon and Machlett) should be limited to the loss of its nationals\u2019 shareholding, not the loss of underlying assets owned by the local Italian company. The Court, however, rejected that contention, finding that (para. 132):\n\nThe Chamber however has some sympathy with the contention of the United States, as being more inaccord with the general purpose of the FCN [Friendship, Commerce and Navigation] Treaty. The United States\u2019 argument is further that Raytheon and Machlett, being the owners of all the shares, were inpractice the persons who alone could decide (before the bankruptcy), whether to dispose of the Immovable property of the company; accordingly, if the requisition did, by triggering the bankruptcy, deprive ELSI of the possibility of disposing of its Immovable property, it was really Raytheon and Machlett who were deprived; and allegedly in violation of Article VII.\n\n321.\n\nThe key to the *ELSI* decision is that Raytheon and Machlett were, in the Court\u2019s description, \"in practice the persons who alone could decide\" the disposition of the company\u2019s assets. This principle - that where a company is controlled, legally or factually, by a certain shareholder or group of shareholders, the latter may be entitled to a direct claim inrespect of the assets of the former-has, as the von Pezold Claimants submit, since gained currency in Investment treaty arbitration. An early Instance was the decision of the tribunal in *Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation,* SCC, Award, 7 July 1998, CLEX-398, cited by the von Pezold Claimants. In that case, the tribunal was required to consider \"whether Mr. Sedelmayer might be regarded as an investor under the Treaty with respect to investments which were - at least formally - not made by him but by different companies\". Noting \"growing support\" for what it labelled the \"control theory\" in International law, the tribunal recognised that, provided it was not Inconsistent with the text of the relevant Treaty, \"an Individual who makes his Investments through a company might be regarded as an investor-a de facto Investor\" (p. 57). Relevant to the tribunal\u2019s decision in *Sedelmayer was* a recognition that inpractice \"It is not unusual that an Individual, who wants to make an Investment abroad, uses a company as a tool\" (p. 57). One might pause to Interpolate that the practice is not only \"not unusual\", in the words of the *Sedelmayer* tribunal, but widespread. Indeed, inmany Instances Investment through a local company is actively required by States as a prerequisite to Investment52. Subsequent cases cited by the von Pezold Claimants have applied this same principle to permit claims by a shareholder inrespect of a State\u2019s conduct towards the underlying assets of their Investment: see\u00a0*Lauder v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, CLEX-190; *Waste Management Inc* v. *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, CLEX-208; *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 April 2007, CLEX-407; *Azurix Corp v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, CLEX-219 (Award subsequently upheld on annulment challenge on jurisdictional grounds).\n\nMr. Moyo recognised at the hearing that in Zimbabwe property is often held through companies (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1618, lines 18-21).\n\n322.\n\nUltimately, for every tribunal It must be a matter of interpretation of the relevant BITs - and, in this case, the ICSID Convention - which determines who may bring proceedings for an alleged violation of the BIT in respect of a protected investment. As the von Pezold Claimants submit, there is nothing in the text of the Swiss or German BITs to preclude a finding that the von Pezold Claimants can bring a claim inrespect of the underlying assets of the Zimbabwean Companies. The fact that the BITs do not expressly anticipate such a claim does not suggest that such claims should be excluded (see\u00a0*Sedelmayer,* p. 57: \"the mere fact that the Treaty is silent on the point now discussed should not be Interpreted so that Mr. Sedelmayer cannot be regarded as a de facto investor\"). The definition of \"investment\" contained in Art 1 of the Swiss and German BITs contains no requirement that the investment be directly held or controlled. Indeed, the definition is framed in the broadest terms inboth BITs: \"every kind of asset[s]\" (see Swiss BIT, Art 1(2), CLEX-5, and German BIT, Art 1(1), CLEX-3). Moreover, the definition of \"investment\" in each BIT further includes \"movable and Immovable property as well as any other rights inrem\", as well as \"shares\" or other kinds of Interests or participation incompanies, as well as any \"claims to money or to any performance\" under contract having an economic value (see Swiss BIT, Art 1(2)(a)-(c), CLEX-5, and German BIT, Art 1 (1)(a)-(c), CLEX-3).\n\n323.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention places no restriction on the type of investment which can give rise to an investment dispute. Article 25(2)(b) provides for the possibility that a locally-incorporated company may bring a claim relying on control by a foreign shareholder, but, as the von Pezold Claimants observe, the inclusion of that provision does not derogate from any right that shareholders in the company might otherwise have to bring proceedings in their own name (see Cl. Observations, para. 186; see also Swiss BIT, Art 1 (1)(c), CLEX-5). One must also be conscious of the express purpose of the ICSID regime generally, and that of the Swiss and German BITs particularly: that the \"encouragement and legal protection of [...] investments [is] apt to stimulate private business Initiative and to Increase the prosperity of both nations\" (See German BIT, Preamble, CLEX-3). The need to provide broad legal protection to foreign investors such as the von Pezold Claimants is one of the primary reasons that investment protection treaties, including the Swiss and German BITs, have been adopted. It is clear that the Respondent was well aware of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 foreign nationality at the time they made their investments, and not only consented to but welcomed those investments (see below para. 354).\n\n324.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants have submitted extensive evidence to demonstrate their legal and factual control of the Zimbabwean Companies. The Tribunal has already accepted that the von Pezold Claimants have established ownership of the Zimbabwean Companies through the respective chains of corporate ownership, with Elisabeth controlling those Investments on behalf of the von Pezold family (see above paras. 125, 134, 139). Inrespect of the Forrester Companies, the von Pezold Claimants exercise legal control of 100% of the companies\u2019 shareholding (see above para. 120). In the case of the Border Companies, the von Pezold Claimants exercise legal control of 86.49% of the shares - a clear controlling majority (see above paras. 127, 215, 226). Finally, as regards the Makandi Companies, the von Pezold Claimants possess only a 50% participation in these companies (and only 44.4% in the Rusitu Valley Development Company (Private) Ltd) (see above para. 136). However, the von Pezold Claimants have also adduced evidence showing that Heinrich, on behalf of the von Pezold family, exercised factual control over the Makandi joint venture (comprising the Makandi Companies) pursuant to a management agreement signed between representatives of the von Pezold Interests and the other 50% Interest held by the Hoegh family (see Heinrich First Witness Statement, paras. 56-58, 478-487; Management Agreement, CC-962). The Tribunal accepts the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 submission that this agreement gave Heinrich, acting on behalf of the von Pezold Claimants, *de facto* control over the Makandi Companies. Control of a company may be factual or effective *(\"de facto\")* as well as legal (see\u00a0International *Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, 26 January 2006, para. 106).\n\n325.\n\nIn light of the above facts, the Tribunal finds that in this case it would be artificial and unjust to limit the von Pezold Claimants to a claim for the indirect expropriation of their shareholdings. The Zimbabwean Companies, controlled by the von Pezold Claimants, are simply the subsidiary vehicles through which the von Pezold Claimants have made their investment. Any conduct by the Respondent targeted towards the Zimbabwean Companies thus was also conduct targeted towards the von Pezold Claimants (Indeed, the fact that the measures taken by the Respondent tended to be directed at farms perceived to be held by \"foreigners\" provides further support forthe proposition that the measures were really directed against the von Pezold Claimants53).\n\nThe Tribunal finds below that the evidence supports a conclusion that the Claimants were targeted as a result of their skin colour: see below para. 501.\n\n326.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal upholds the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 submission that they have a right to bring claims in respect of the underlying assets held by the Zimbabwean Companies. The von Pezold Claimants\u2019 ownership and control of the Zimbabwean Properties (and related assets) through an indirect corporate holding structure presents no bar to their claims for restitution and/or compensation for the loss suffered to those investments. The Respondent\u2019s objection that the von Pezold Claimants lack standing to bring claims relating to the protected Investments is therefore dismissed.\n\n327.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the ICSID Convention, and the relevant BIT\u2019s, over both the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Investments and the Border Claimants\u2019 Investments, as defined above.\n\n**E. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Temporis*** **under the German BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent argues that no agreement existed for the provisional application of the German BIT before it entered Into force (see Rejoinder, paras. 237-238) and, as the measures complained of in respect of the Forrester Water Rights occurred prior to the entry Into force of the German BIT (i.e., in January 2000), the Respondent reasons that any claim in connection with such measures is not covered by the German BIT (see *ibid.* *,* para. 237)54.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, whilst the Respondent appears to extend its pleading to the Swiss BIT, the Claimants have only brought their Forrester Water Rights claims under the German BIT, having expressly acknowledged that the Swiss BIT had not yet entered into force during the relevant period and there was no agreement for its provisional application. See Reply, para. 434.\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent explains its position on the provisional application of the German BIT as follows (see *ibid.**,* para. 238; Resp. PHB, para. 37):\n\nThe note to the German Ambassador by the then Respondent\u2019s Minister of Finance, Mr Herbert Murerwa, was a unilateral expression of the intention to which there was no corresponding agreement from the German authorities which constitutes the condition for provisional application of the BIT. Considered on its own, the note cannot found the basis of an agreement such as is contemplated under Article 25 of the Vienna Convention. The note, in the absence of corresponding acceptance of that act by the Federal Republic of Germany, does not meet even the broad standards required of an agreement under that article. It shall be noted that note verbale insists on the fact that \"this declaration is made in the expectation that the Federal Republic of Germany is considering the issue of guarantees for German investments in Zimbabwe already prior to the entry into force of the Agreement.\" A declaration is not an undertaking. Moreover, even if accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany, the entry into force of the BIT on a preliminary basis would only cover the investments guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Germany. This is obviously not the case here. Accordingly the note by the then Zimbabwean Minister of Finance establishes no agreement for the provisional application of the BIT and as such the Claimants cannot establish any claim in relation to water rights prior to the date on which the BIT entered into force.\n\n330.\n\nThe Respondent draws an analogy (see Resp. PHB, para. 37) to the case in *Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Government of the Union of Myanmar*  ***(\"Yaung\")***(see ASEAN I.D. Case No. ARB/01/1, Award, 31 March 2003, RLEX-21), a dispute under the 1987 ASEAN Agreement between a Singaporean company and the Government of the Union of Myanmar relating to a joint venture in Myanmar. The Government of Myanmar disputed the jurisdiction of the tribunal on the ground that the investment had not been specifically approved as required by the terms of the ASEAN Agreement. Article 11(1) of the Agreement provided that the investment must be \"specifically approved in writing and registered by the host country and upon such conditions as it deems fit for the purposes of this Agreement\" to benefit from the investment protections of the Agreement. However, Article ll(3) further provided that an investment made prior to the entry into force of the Agreement for the host State would only be covered if it was \"specifically approved in writing and registered by the host country and upon such conditions as it deems fit for the purpose of this Agreement subsequent in its entry into force.\" The claimant argued that Article II was satisfied since the investment was already approved in writing by the FIC, an organ of Myanmar, and there was no indication in the Agreement that a special procedure for registration was required. The respondent argued that the provision required approval specifically \"for the purpose of this Agreement\" and that the investment had not received such approval. The claimant admitted that, in order to benefit from protection under the 1987 Agreement, its investment had to satisfy the requirements of Article ll(3). It argued that, as no specific procedure had been identified in Article II nor had Myanmar made any specific requirements in regard to that provision, the prior acts of approval should be seen as having satisfied Article 11 (3). The *Yaung* tribunal concluded that the claimant's investment did not qualify for protection having failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 11(3), reasoning as follows:\n\n58. The Tribunal notes that under Article II of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement, there is an express requirement of approval in writing and registration of a foreign Investment If It is to be covered by the Agreement. Such a requirement is not universal in Investment protection agreements: it does not apply, for example, under the 1998 Framework Agreement. In this respect Article II goes beyond the general rule that for a foreign investment to enjoy treaty protection it must be lawful under the law of the host State. The Tribunal noted that a requirement of specific approval and registration already existed under the legislation of certain parties to the 1987 Agreement, especially those with centrally-managed economies. This was, and remains, the situation in Myanmar where no foreign Investment can be made without specific approval of the Government of Myanmar acting through the FIC. Under the Foreign Investment Law this approval is given in writing after a thorough process. In the Tribunal's view, this process is in substance that described in Article 11(1) of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement. In its Procedural Order no. 2, the Tribunal indicated that on the information currently available as to the practice of the various parties to the 1987 ASEAN Agreement, including the Respondent, it was not inclined to interpret the Agreement as requiring a special procedure for registration forthe purposes of Article II. The Tribunal is reinforced in this view by the further information provided. It appears that no party to the Agreement which has a general legal requirement for the approval of foreign investment has felt it necessary to set up, in addition, a special procedure for the purposes of Article II. It is true that there is such a procedure in Singapore. But even there it was not specifically designed exclusively forthe purposes of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement. Moreover the situation in Singapore is different because foreign investments can be made freely there without any requirement of approval or registration.\n\n59. No doubt a Party to the 1987 ASEAN Agreement could establish a separate register of protected investments for the purposes of that Agreement, in addition to or in lieu of approval under its internal law. But if Myanmar had wished to draw a distinction between approval forthe purposes of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement and approval for the purposes of its internal law, it should have made it clear to potential investors that both procedures co-exist and, further, how an application for treaty protection could be made. At the least it would be appropriate to notify the ASEAN Secretariat of any special procedure. None of these things was done. In the Tribunal's view, if a State Party to the 1987 ASEAN Agreement unequivocally and without reservation approves in writing a foreign investment proposal under its internal law, that investment must be taken to be registered and approved also for the purposes of the Agreement. In other words, when a foreign investment, brought into Myanmar by a national or a company of a Party to the 1987 ASEAN Agreement, has been approved and registered in writing as such by the relevant authorities under the laws of Myanmar after the entry into force of the Agreement for Myanmar, this investment should be deemed specifically approved in writing and registered for the purposes of Article ll(3), and it is entitled to treaty protection.\n\n60. It follows from this interpretation of Article II that - had the 1987 ASEAN Agreement been in force for Myanmar in 1993 when the Joint Venture Agreement was signed - the Claimant's investment would have been protected. But, under Article ll(3), a further test has to be met. In the present case the investment was approved and most of it had been effectively made before 23 July 1997, when the 1987 ASEAN Agreement entered into force for Myanmar. It follows from the actual language of Article ll(3) that investments made before that date are not automatically covered, even if they were approved in writing and registered under the law of the host State when they were made. It is not uncommon for investment protection treaties to apply to pre-existing investments, but the extent to which the 1987 ASEAN Agreement does so is expressly stated in Article ll(3). It is true that the procedure for giving approval under Article ll(3) is not spelled out, and there appear to be no indications to be drawn from ASEAN practice on this point. But effect must be given to the actual language of Article ll(3), which requires an express subsequent act amounting at least to a written approval and eventually to registration of the investment. The mere fact that an approval and registration earlier given by the host State continued to be operative after the entry into force of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement for that State is not sufficient.\n\n331.\n\nThe Respondent argues in the alternative that, should the Tribunal find the German BIT to apply provisionally prior to its entry Into force, then Article 9(b) of the BIT applies and, as no specific approval was given by the competent authorities of the Forrester Water Rights Investment, the Investment is not covered by the BIT (see Rejoinder, para. 238).\n\n332.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues as regards the Makandi Water Permits that such permits do not constitute an \"investment\" in terms of the German BIT, as these permits are given to the occupier of agricultural land to use water for agricultural purposes and expire after 20 years. As a result, the Respondent insists that no value can attach to them so as to warrant compensation (see Rejoinder, para. 239).\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------\n\n333.\n\nAs noted above, the German BIT was signed on 29 September 1995 and entered into force on 14 April 2000. However, the Claimants assert that, by agreement of the Governments of Germany and Zimbabwe, the BIT provisionally applied as from 18 September 1996. The timing of the treaty\u2019s application is relevant to the Claimants\u2019 establishment of certain alleged breaches.\n\n334.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants submit, on the basis of Article 25(1)(b) of the *Vienna Convention,* that an agreement for the provisional application of a treaty may be implicit, through acquiescence, by way of separate agreement or by way of conduct. The Claimants insist that the provisional application of the German BIT is evidenced from the following:\n\n\u2022 The Zimbabwean Minister of Finance sent a Note to the German Ambassador, dated 18 September 1996 (the **\"Zimbabwean Note\"),** stating that:\n\nThe Republic of Zimbabwe, after having taken note of the fact that the competent authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany may grant measures for the encouragement of German investments in Zimbabwe already prior to the entry into force of the Agreement, will apply the Agreement on a preliminary basis, as from the date of this Note, pending the Agreement's formal entry into force in accordance with its terms. The Federal Republic of Germany will take the necessary steps to conclude the ratification process currently underway as soon as possible. This declaration is made in the expectation that the Federal Republic of Germany is considering the issue of guarantees for German investments in Zimbabwe already prior to the entry into force of the Agreement\" (see CLEX-3);\n\n\u2022 Germany assisted in the drafting of the Zimbabwean Note (see Letter from Minister Murerwa (the Minister of Finance) to Graf Leutrum regarding BIT Zimbabwe - Germany ratified, 18 September, 1996, C-497);\n\n\u2022 The German Ambassador Immediately responded to the Zimbabwean Note, confirming receipt (see Letter from Ambassador Norwln Graf Leutrum to Minister H Murerwa, 18 September 1996, C-782);\n\n\u2022 On 19 September 1996, the German Ambassador Informed the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the \"Exchange of notes to Provisional Application of the [German BIT] was completed on 18.09.1996\", in time for the Hamburg Investment conference (see Letter from Ambassador Norwin Graf Leutrum to Minister H Murerwa, 18 September 1996, C-783);\n\n\u2022 President Mugabe attended the investment conference in Hamburg at the end of September 1996 (see Cl. Skel., para. 43; see also Reply, paras. 515-527).\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimants rely on *Kardassopoulos* in support of their position that the effect of the foregoing agreement for provisional application is that the German BIT applied from 18 September 1996, as If It was already inforce (see\u00a0*Kardassopoulos,* paras. 219 and 250, CLEX-227). The Claimants aver that Zimbabwe did not limit provisional application of the BIT to investments that had been guaranteed by Germany, but that it had merely stated it was agreeing to provisional application because Germany had stated it was \"considering\" the issue of guarantees of German Investments (see Cl. Skel., para. 44).\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimants further note that Mr. Nyaguse admitted during his testimony that the German BIT applied provisionally from 18 September 1996 (see Cl. PHB, para. 41; Tr. D5, p. 1517, lines 5-16, p. 1518, lines 9-10). Mr. Nyaguse testified as follows:\n\nQ. Do you remember being involved in the process whereby the German Bilateral Investment Treaty was actually to apply from the date you were in the - at the conference onwards, which I was September\u2014if I remember, it\u2019s about 18 September, 1996?\n\nA. Yes. I recall because I was part of the team that negotiated the BIT with Germany.\n\nQ. So was it important for you that when you got to Germany, you could say to the German investors, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got this Treaty which applies and, therefore, your investments are going to have all the benefits of the German Treaty\u2019?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Can you recall when Zimbabwe signed its first Bilateral Investment Treaty? I have an idea, but I\u2019d like to hear your opinion.\n\nA. I think the first agreement was 1995, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\n\nQ. Okay. Do you think it might have been 1994, but around that time?\n\nA. Signing or ratifying? Because those are two different processes.\n\nQ. Yes, it enters into force when its ratified.\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n337.\n\nAs discussed above, the issue of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* relates solely to the alleged breach of the German BIT in relation to the Forrester Water Rights.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that whether the German BIT provisionally came into force from 18 September 1996 turns on the exchange of Notes that occurred between Zimbabwe and Germany. Having reviewed the underlying documentation, the Tribunal finds that there is sufficient evidence on the record of the provisional entry into force of the German BIT.\n\n339.\n\nProvisional application of a treaty is governed by Article 25(1) of the *Vienna Convention,* which provides that a treaty may be applied provisionally (pending its entry into force) if: (a) the treaty itself so provides; or (b) the parties have \"in some other manner\" so agreed. In this case, it is (b) that applies.\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Zimbabwean Note represents a clear expression of Zimbabwe\u2019s intention that the German BIT would apply from 18 September 1996. In particular, the Tribunal notes the following factors:\n\n\u2022 The declaration was made in the context of both parties seeking to \"intensify economic cooperation\" between them by creating \"favourable conditions for investments\" (as stated in the preamble of the German BIT). Giving the treaty provisional effect is consistent with these objectives.\n\n\u2022 The Zimbabwean Note was signed by Zimbabwe\u2019s Minister of Finance, who is a person \"representing the State\" in connection with his portfolio. The Respondent has not argued that the Finance Minister was not authorised to bind the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\n\u2022 The Zimbabwean Note expressly states that the Republic of Zimbabwe would apply the Agreement on a preliminary basis, from the date of the Note. There is no ambiguity in the language used.\n\n341.\n\nUnder Article 25 of the *Vienna Convention,* there is no particular form which the agreement of the German Government should take. A United Nations (\"UN\") Report on the provisional application of treaties makes it clear that the determinative factor here is the intention of the parties. It is clear from Germany\u2019s response, the fact that it assisted in drafting the original note, and from its subsequent conduct, that agreement was provided. An example of such conduct is the letter from the German Ambassador to the German Ministry of Affairs on 19 September 1996 to advise that the \"exchange of notes\" regarding provisional application of the German BIT had been completed. This is strong evidence that Germany considered that the German BIT was to come into effect prior to the date of ratification.\n\n342.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that even if the German BIT applied provisionally from 18 September 1996, it \"would only cover the investments guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Germany\". The language used in the Note does not support the imposition of such a condition, and is, at most, equivocal. The words \"is made in the expectation\" are not strong enough to create a binding condition limiting the provisional application to investments that had been guaranteed by Germany. This conclusion is reflected by the similarly weak language -\"considering the issue\" - used to describe the purported condition.\n\n343.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under the German BIT in respect of the Forrester Water Rights.\n\n**F. Admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 Claims**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n344.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent acknowledged that it has presented its objections regarding the legality of the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments and their approval as admissibility objections as opposed to jurisdictional objections (see Resp. PHB, para. 180), and continued to allege in its Post-Hearing Brief that, based on a similar analysis to that carried out by the tribunal in *Enron,* the Claimants\u2019 claims are inadmissible (see Resp. PHB, paras. 183-184). The Respondent nevertheless submitted that jurisdiction and admissibility are often considered together (see Resp. PHB, para. 182), referring to the following assessment by the tribunal in *loan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania*  ***(\"loan Micula\")***(see Resp. PHB, n. 681, citing ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras. 63-64, CLEX-237)55:\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that when an objection relates to a requirement contained in the text on which consent is based, it remains a jurisdictional objection. If such a requirement is not satisfied, the Tribunal may not examine the case at all for lack of jurisdiction. By contrast, an objection relating to admissibility will not necessarily bar the Tribunal from examining the case if the reasons for the inadmissibility of the claim are capable of being removed and are indeed removed at a subsequent stage. In other words, consent is a prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In this proceeding, as it will be shown in the course of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, the vast majority of Respondent\u2019s objections are actually objections to jurisdiction.\n\nIt is noted that, in *loan Micula,* the respondent raised objections on grounds of nationality, definition of investment (whether it included \"incentives\"), absence of a showing of harm, temporal application of the BIT and nature of remedy sought (restitution).\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimants state, importantly, that the availability of their MFN defence to these objections turns on their characterisation as admissibility objections as opposed to jurisdictional objections (see Cl. PHB, para. 75):\n\nThe MFN clause can be relied upon to avoid the approval requirement under the German BIT (if it exists) because it is an issue of admissibility, not jurisdiction. The distinction between these two concepts can be summarised as follows: at the jurisdictional stage the question is whether an investment qualifies for protection under the BIT, while at the admissibility stage the question is whether such protection is limited or revoked by the terms of the BIT. Where there is a qualifying \"investment\" within the terms of the relevant treaty, the State has consented to granting the investor the substantive protections of the treaty and jurisdiction is established. Where \"investment\" is not explicitly defined in terms of approval (as is the case with the German BIT - see Article 1(1)), approval is irrelevant to assessing the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction - any contrary Interpretation would fail to give effect to the State parties\u2019 decision to separate the two concepts.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined to treat the Respondent\u2019s Approval and Illegality Objections in this Award as admissibility objections, consistent with how they have been presented by the Respondent in the majority of its pleadings. The Tribunal notes, however, that the characterization of these arguments as either jurisdictional or relating to admissibility, in these cases, is immaterial save as to whether the Claimants are entitled to raise their MFN defence. As shall be seen, however, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider this defence and this too, therefore, has no effect on the treatment of these objections as either jurisdictional or relating to admissibility.\n\n(2) The Respondent\u2019s Request to Re-Open PO No. 9\n------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent made a number of allegations of procedural abuse and violation of its right to be heard in connection with, in particular, PO No. 9. Specifically, the Respondent stated, at paragraphs 83-84, the following:\n\n... Respondent considers that Claimants obtained PO No. 9 as the direct result of Claimant\u2019s own tardy submission of C-858, their only written BIT - access -condition \"approval\" from the \"time of admission\" of their acquisitions. The Claimant should have submitted that document key to these arbitrations with their Surrejoinder on 1 March 2013. Had Claimants played by the procedural rules of the game that they demand of others, at the risk of becoming the \"footmen\" of the \"rules and regulations of these Arbitral Tribunals\" [sic], Respondent would have been in a position to respond to c-585 [sic], submitting R-087 and r-082 (Mr. Masiiwa\u2019s comments on C-858) with its Rebutter. Similarly, Claimants are even more tardy in testifying for the first time during oral proceedings that both Forrester and Border required Reserve Bank Exchange Control approvals as described in para 134 of this Post-Hearing Brief, these key elements of Information, wilfully tardily submitted by Claimants, permit Respondent and these Arbitral Tribunals to \"connect the dots\" proving Illegality. It is not possible, under these circumstances for these Arbitral Tribunals to exclude Claimants\u2019 tardy proof of the Illegality of their acquisitions. Once proof of the legal acts is known, it is not possible to \"Ignore It\" for sterile \"procedural\" reasons, particularly when that proof is submitted by the Party It Incriminates. Further, as Claimants are responsible forthat tardy submission and as these proceedings are now at end, no further exhibits should be submitted by either party.\n\nIt is on the basis of these manipulations and misrepresentations that Claimants led the Arbitral Tribunals to issue PO No. 9 preventing Respondent from presenting key legal arguments having a direct Impact on the case without Respondent having had the benefit of le contradictoire. Therefore, Respondent considers that the Arbitral Tribunals cannot maintain PO No. 9 as it regards exchange control regulations (C-858/R-087) and consequently should consider fully Mr. Masllwa\u2019s Third Witness Statement, the full text of Respondent\u2019s 26 September 2013 Reply on Approval/lllegallty and all related Oral Argument and witness testimony redacted from the hearing transcripts. Additionally, the Arbitral Tribunals should consider the fact that Respondent\u2019s right to be heard was silenced during the last phase of these proceedings and consequently has prevented Respondent from presenting the fullness of its arguments on Illegality in its Skeleton Argument, during Oral Proceedings and generally after PO 9.\n\n348.\n\nIn view of the serious nature of the Respondent\u2019s allegations and its request that PO No. 9 be reconsidered, the Tribunal sets out below a detailed review of the procedural history leading up to issuance of PO No. 9, as well as a summary of the admissibility Issues surrounding certain of the Respondent\u2019s defences and allegations raised both before and after the Hearing.\n\n349.\n\nIt is recalled that during the Joint First Session of the Tribunal with the Parties, held on 7 February 2011, the Respondent stated that it did not intend to file any objections to jurisdiction (see Minutes of the Joint First Session, Arts. 13.1 and 16.1). However, the Respondent did raise objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in its Rejoinder, which was to have been the final written pleading served in this arbitration.\n\n350.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder in which It raised the following objections for the first time:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 Investments are not \"foreign\" as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;\n\n\u2022 No \"Investment\" was made by the Claimants within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as this term has been Interpreted through ICSID jurisprudence;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 claims constitute Impermissible \"Indirect claims\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;\n\n\u2022 No specific approval was obtained by the competent authorities at the time of admission of the Investments56 pursuant to Article 9(b) of the German BIT, therefore the German BIT does not apply (the **\"Approval Objection\");**\n\n\u2022 The Claimants have not proved beneficial ownership of the Investments;\n\n\u2022 The Forrester Water Rights do not constitute an Investment under the German BIT; and\n\n\u2022 The German BIT does not apply provisionally to any events occurring prior to its entry Into force, such as the conversion of the Forrester Water Rights to Water Permits.\n\nThe Respondent did not identify at this stage what form of approval was required or by whom. The Respondent also did not argue at this stage whether any subsequent approval might satisfy the requirements of Article 9(b) of the German BIT.\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimants sought an order from the Tribunal that the jurisdictional objections pleaded in the Rejoinder, in so far as they related to the Claimants\u2019 cases as pleaded in the Memorial, are Inadmissible or, alternatively, an order directing that the jurisdictional objections be joined to the merits, that a new round of briefing on those objections be directed, and that new hearing dates be set.\n\n352.\n\nIn PO No. 3, the Tribunal found as follows:\n\n44. The Arbitral Tribunals consider that the jurisdictional challenges contained in the Rejoinder, in so far as they relate to the Claimants\u2019 ancillary claims pleaded with its Reply, are timely raised. However, in so far as the challenges relate to the Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded in the Memorial, those challenges should have been brought at an earlier stage of the proceedings, consistent with Rule 41(1) of the Arbitration Rules. The consequences of these findings shall be dealt with below.\n\n\u2026\n\n49. The Arbitral Tribunals therefore find that the Respondent has raised certain jurisdictional challenges and new defences after the time limits set fordoing so in these cases and under the Arbitration Rules. The question remains whether \"special circumstances\" exist, within the meaning of Rule 26(3), so as to engage the Tribunals\u2019 discretion to admit these challenges and defences after the time when they ought to have been pleaded.\n\n50. The fact of external counsel having been retained at a late date is not, in the Arbitral Tribunals\u2019 consideration, sufficient in itself, in the circumstances of these cases, to justify a finding of \"special circumstances\" within the meaning of Rule 26(3). The Tribunals do not find the analogy to default proceedings to be apposite for the same reasons articulated by the Claimants. That is, the issue is not the Respondent\u2019s right to be heard, but rather the Parties\u2019 equal right to due process and a fair proceeding, which includes respect for the time limits fixed by the Tribunals for each step in the proceedings.\n\n51. The Arbitral Tribunals note the additional factors Identified by the Respondent in its December 28th Letter, namely the submission of new, ancillary claims by the Claimants almost one year after the date on which they submitted their Memorial, the absence of \"new\" facts or documents contained or referred to in the Rejoinder, and the Respondent\u2019s offer to agree a further limited round of pleading to ensure that both Parties have the opportunity to fully plead their case. In relation to the Respondent\u2019s first point, the Tribunals agree that the delay in which the Claimants\u2019 ancillary claims were brought is, practically speaking, partly the cause of the present difficulty of managing the Respondent\u2019s late-raised jurisdictional challenges and defences in such close proximity to the Hearing.\n\n52. On a related point, the Tribunals observe that were they to disregard the jurisdictional objections as they relate to the Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded in the Memorial, simply as being out of time, but admit, as they must, the jurisdictional objections as they relate to the ancillary claims pleaded by the Claimants with their Reply, a paradoxical situation would result. The absence of any new facts underpinning the jurisdictional objections and defences raised in the Rejoinder, such that no undue evidentiary burden would be placed on the Claimants at this stage of the proceedings, strengthens the case that the late-raised jurisdictional challenges and defences ought to be admitted and heard together with those timely raised jurisdictional challenges and defences.\n\n53. Finally, the Tribunals note the Claimants\u2019 own concern regarding the enforceability of any future award rendered in these cases in the event the Respondent is not \"fully heard\" on its jurisdictional objections and defences, and their proposal, echoing that of the Respondent, to establish further written and oral procedures in order to ensure that each Party has an adequate opportunity to respond to the other Party\u2019s case.\n\n54. The Arbitral Tribunals find that the above factors, cumulatively, constitute special circumstances compelling It to exercise its discretion pursuant to Rule 26(3) to admit the late-raised jurisdictional challenges and the new defences and to fix new time limits for the remaining steps in the proceedings.\n\n353.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal ordered a new briefing scheduling, directing the Claimants to file their observations on the Rejoinder by 1 March 2013 (i.e., the **\"Surrejoinder\")** and the Respondent to file its response to the Claimants\u2019 observations by 19 April 2013 (i.e., the **\"Rebutter\").** The February 2013 hearing dates were vacated and new hearing dates were set for 10-14 June 2013 (i.e., the June 2013 Hearing dates).\n\n354.\n\nIn their Surrejoinder, the Claimants raised the following arguments indefence to the Approval Objection:\n\n\u2022 Ad Article 2 of the German Protocol alters the Interpretation of Article 9(b) by contradicting, and Indeed removing, the requirement under Article 9(b) of the German BIT that German Investments must be specifically approved at the time of admission;\n\n\u2022 Subsequent practice, evident through the exchange of *Notes Verbales,* the Witness Statement of the former German Ambassador to Zimbabwe (see Conze I, para. 7) and Zimbabwean Government practice (see Surrejoinder, paras. 291-315), supports the above Interpretation;\n\n\u2022 Alternatively, any approval requirement has been satisfied (see Surrejoinder, para. 316). in connection with this last argument, the Claimants offered the following Interpretation:\n\nGiven that there was no formal approval process articulated in the German BIT, (and in any event) the reasonable conclusion is that the effect of Ad Article 2 of the German Protocol is to grant advance specific approval in relation to all German Investments. This Interpretation chimes with the words in Ad Article 2:\n\n\"Investments made inaccordance with the laws [of Zimbabwe]... shall enjoy the full protection of the Agreement.\"\n\n\u2022 in the further alternative, the Claimants argued that, in the absence of a specific mechanism by which investments were to have been specifically approved, informal approval sufficed to meet requirement. The Claimants pointed to the following examples of approvals in connection with each Estate:\n\no Forrester Estate (see Surrejoinder, paras. 322-328):\n\n\u25a0 encouragement from senior Government officials, informally and in formal correspondence;\n\n\u25a0 approval of the conversion of leasehold title to freehold title on four of the ten properties on the Forrester Estate;\n\n\u25a0 From 1988 onwards, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe granted the von Pezold Claimants permission to purchase \"blocked funds\" in order to build a dam on the Forrester Estate, and they also issued them with Special Dividend Import Licences;\n\n\u25a0 From 1994 to 1998, the Reserve Bank approved all of the Loans made by Elisabeth; and\n\n\u25a0 In 1997, Forrester was granted an Export Promotion Zone Licence by the Zimbabwean Investment Centre for Forrester Estate\u2019s agricultural operations. This Licence granted the holder special incentives.\n\no Border Estate (see Surrejoinder, paras. 329-332):\n\n\u25a0 encouragement from senior Government officials, informally and in formal correspondence;\n\n\u25a0 Around 2004 when Border wanted to export Border\u2019s products to South Africa, it applied to the Central Bank for approval as to the margin that it could agree with its South African agent. Border was granted this approval; and\n\n\u25a0 Border has been granted all of the necessary licences to operate the sawmills and factories and was granted an Export Processing Zone Licence in April 1997. This Licence granted the holder special incentives.\n\no Makandi Estate (see Surrejoinder, para. 333):\n\n\u25a0 In addition to various licences held by Makandi Estate, they also pay various annual fees to the Environmental Management Agency, for pulp waste, coffee effluent and Industrial effluent. The Makandi Estate has also been issued with various fire-arms certificates by the Firearms Controller, for the protection of crops and livestock on Makandi Estate.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, or in the alternative, the Claimants argued that the Respondent was estopped from denying that the German BIT applies to the Claimants\u2019 Investments and/or estopped from denying that they have received any requisite approvals (see Surrejoinder, paras. 335-357).\n\n355.\n\nIn its Rebutter, the Respondent responded to the afore-mentioned submissions on approvals, noting that Zimbabwe had \"Foreign Investment Authorisation Procedures\" inplace before the von Pezold Claimants began acquiring their holdings and that they continue to have such procedures inplace today. The Respondent stated that, during the 1980s and through 1993, such Investment approvals were issued by the Zimbabwe Foreign Investment Committee **(\"FIC\"),** which was subsumed Into the Zimbabwe Investment Authority **(\"ZIA\"** or **\"ZIC\")** (see Rebutter, para. 21). The Respondent further pleaded as follows (see Rebutter, paras. 337-341):\n\n337. Claimants\u2019 failure to submit in this arbitration such approval or written confirmation that the German BIT or the Swiss BIT is applicable for their investments and specifically their principal Investment in 1988 establishes that such Investment is not subject to any protection under the German BIT under its explicit terms.\n\n338. Claimants neither applied for, obtained nor submitted in this arbitration any \"specific approval,\" particularly at the time of purchase of their holdings, yet they have the audacity to post a heading in their 1 March 2013 Observations that \"(iv) If approval is required, it has been given by the Respondent.\"\n\n339. However, upon careful review of materials submitted, the Arbitral Tribunal will note that Claimants do not affirm that they made any \"specific\" request for approval nor do they submit any document giving any such \"specific approval at the time of\u2019 their 1988 project founding purchase.\n\nWhat Claimants do is to assert their will in a princely manner:\n\n(i) \"Informal approval must suffice.\" That will no longer make law.\n\n(ii) \"Anonymous approval must suffice\";\n\n(iii) \"Attending parliament must suffice\";\n\n(iv) \"No name discretion is elegant and must suffice\";\n\n(v) \"these\u2014people\u2014wanted\u2014and\u2014Indeed\u2014encouraged\" sounds like an anachronistic view of rape where the women must have wanted\u2014and\u2014 Indeed\u2014encouraged to lose her sovereignty over her own body - Zimbabwe must have wanted\u2014and\u2014Indeed\u2014 encouraged Claimants to take sovereignty over 78 275 hectares (which converts to 193 421.74 acres) of rich farmland ------ a rich farmland area greater than that available in a number of nations------ with no preliminary \"formalities\" required!\n\n(vi) \"they also pay various annual fees to the Environmental Management Agency, for pulp waste, coffee effluent and industrial effluent. The Makandi Estate has also been issued with various firearms certificates by the Firearms Controller, for the protection of crops and livestock on Makandi Estate\"\n\n340. None of these even remotely resembles the Article 9 b) standard:\n\n\"b) specifically approved by the competent authorities of the latter Contracting Party at the time of their admission.\"\n\n341. Certainly such evidence does not remotely resemble a foreign investment made \"in accordance with the laws of the Host State\", which have at all relevant times required ZFIC *I* ZIA approval, [footnotes omitted]\n\n356.\n\nThe Respondent again raised new objections, alleging that the Claimants\u2019 investments were not \"actively made\", as required under the BITs, and that they were not made in accordance with the laws of the host State as required by Article 9(a) of the German BIT and Article 2 of the Swiss BIT (the **\"Illegality Objection\").**\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent framed its Illegality Objection as follows (see Rebutter, para. 68):\n\nSo it is that Claimants seek to base on the German BIT itself and *I* or the Swiss BIT itself the jurisdiction of the Centre to hear its disputes with Zimbabwe. However, for the reasons indicated in the Inceysa Award quoted above, Claimants cannot benefit from the rights granted in the German or in the Swiss BIT, including access to the jurisdiction of the Centre, because its investment does not meet the conditions set forth in Article 9 of the German BIT and in Article 2 of the Swiss BIT necessary for Claimants\u2019 assets to be included within the scope of that investment protection.\n\n358.\n\nThe Respondent pleaded its Illegality Objection in the following terms (see Rebutter, paras. 90-93, 110-117):\n\n90. The laws of Zimbabwe in 1988, when Claimants allegedly acquired their fundamental holdings included the obligation for foreign investments to receive the approval of the Zimbabwe FIC; and for investments made after 19 November 1993 such approval was issued by the ZIA.\n\n91. As set out in Section 21 above, Mr Nyaguse establishes in his witness statement that the laws of Zimbabwe have since well before Claimants\u2019 confidential acquisition of holdings and to this day, included foreign investment approval------via the FIC through 19 November 1993 and the ZIA thereafter------ pursuant to written applications resulting in written approvals. In this regard, in line with the meaning of \"specific,\" any written approval or consent had to be \"peculiar or proper to somebody or something.\"\n\n92. It is clear from Claimants\u2019 file that they did not comply with Zimbabwe Law as they neither applied for nor received \"at the time of their admission\" or at any time thereafter, the required approval from the Zimbabwe FIC, thus falling to meet the \"made incompliance with laws\" requirement and the \"specific approval\" requirement of the German BIT.\n\n93. As such, their confidentially acquired holdings are inviolation of national law and, via the terms of Article 9 a) of the German BIT International law which Incorporates national law for purposes of ICSID consent. The BITs, public International law and the law of Zimbabwe are thus each relevant.\n\n\u2026\n\n110. It is clear from Claimants\u2019 file that they did not comply with Zimbabwe Law as they neither applied nor received the required approval from the Zimbabwe FIC.\n\n111. As such, such confidentially acquired holdings being inviolation of national law, they fall to be \"made\" [sic] \"accordance with the laws\" \"of the latter Contracting Party.\"\n\n359.\n\nThe Respondent tendered into evidence a Witness Statement from Mr. Grasiano Nyaguse in support of both its Approval Objection and its Illegality Objection.\n\n360.\n\nOn 18 July 2013, the Claimants brought an application relating to the Illegality Objection and to the new evidence filed insupport thereof and insupport of the Approval Objection (e.g., Mr. Nyaguse\u2019s Witness Statement, R-56). The Claimants amended their application on 1 August 2013, withdrawing their objection to the new evidence in support of the Approval Objection and seeking a further written procedure to respond to the evidence.\n\n361.\n\nIn PO No. 7, the Tribunal began its analysis by noting that the hearing had already been postponed in these cases three times and that insuch circumstances, the matters raised in the application could not lead to a further postponement of the hearing. The Tribunal made the following findings, among others:\n\n45. It is clear to the Tribunals that the Respondent, inpleading the Illegality Objection, has not adhered strictly to the above provisions of the Arbitration Rules or Summary Minutes, nor to the directions in PO No. 3 relating to new submissions. The Tribunals are nevertheless loathe to declare inadmissible a jurisdictional objection raised (imprecisely) by a sovereign state unless to do so would jeopardize the Tribunal\u2019s starting premise articulated in paragraph 31 above, that is to result in a postponement of the Hearing of these cases.\n\n46. Article 26(1) of the Arbitration Rules requires that the Tribunals disregard any steps taken after the time for doing so unless \"special circumstances\" exist. As the Tribunals noted in PO No. 3, the fact of external counsel having been retained at a late date is not, in itself, sufficient to justify a finding of special circumstances (see PO No. 3, para. 50), although it is relevant to the exercise of retrospectively reviewing the pleadings for the point at which certain defences have been pleaded and why defences may not have been timely raised.\n\n47. While not stated expressly in PO No. 3, the Tribunals also consider the jurisdictional nature of the defences the subject of the Application to be a factor in determining whether special circumstances exist. The Tribunals recall the concern expressed by the Claimants regarding the enforceability of any future award in the event the Tribunals had exercised their discretion to exclude the Respondent\u2019s late-raised jurisdictional objections in PO No. 3 (see PO No. 3, paras. 20 and 53). The Tribunals consider that, while not raised as a concern by the Claimants in the present Application, failure to admit the jurisdictional defences, could ultimately jeopardize the enforceability of any award these Tribunals may render.\n\n48. Finally, based on the review the Tribunals have conducted for the purpose of deciding the Application, the so-called Illegality Objection appears to be sufficiently limited in scope that a supplemental written procedure may be accommodated within the remaining timetable without jeopardizing the Hearing dates.\n\n49. It is therefore not without some hesitation that the Tribunals have decided to dismiss the Claimants\u2019 request that the Illegality Objection be ordered inadmissible and disregarded, and grant the Respondent\u2019s petition, subject strictly to the directions set out in Section V below.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal further sought to address an issue raised by the Respondent regarding what it considered to be a \"procedural reality\" of these cases:\n\n56. Finally, the Tribunals note with some concern the following paragraph from the Respondent\u2019s Reply (see Respondent\u2019s Reply, para. 191):\n\n\"Claimants seem to want to ignore one key procedural reality: the proceedings are not closed and Respondent has every right during the oral phase of proceedings, during both cross-examination and oral argument, to draw the arbitrators\u2019 or the witnesses\u2019 attention to any document on the record and to draw any conclusion and make any suggested characterisation is [sic] wishes to make with respect to any issue related to the file.\"\n\n57. Whilst it is correct that the proceedings are not closed and that both Parties are entitled to a full and fair hearing of the case, fairness requires that each party know with a reasonable degree of certainty the other party\u2019s case in order to respond to it in writing and during the oral procedure. The time limits fixed by the Tribunals in these proceedings and the procedural rules agreed by the Parties are not merely formalities but also serve the important purpose of ensuring the equality of the Parties and a fair procedure. Accordingly, any \"characterisation\" that a Party wishes to make with respect to \"an issue related to the file\" must nonetheless remain within the bounds of what has been pleaded to be in issue. Similarly, no new argument nor any new evidence may be introduced during the oral procedure without the Tribunal\u2019s prior consent.\n\n58. The Tribunals reiterate the Imperative stated at the beginning of this Procedural Order, that the Hearing scheduled to commence on 28 October 2013 must proceed as planned, and urge the Parties to direct their energies to preparing, as the Members of the Tribunals must also do, for the Hearing.\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal directed a further written procedure, affording the Respondent an opportunity to submit \"a concise statement of its jurisdictional objection on the basis of Article 9(a) of the German BIT and Article 2 of the Swiss BIT, limited to the law and evidence already on the record\" by 16 August 2013 (i.e., the Re-Rebutter). The Claimants were also afforded an opportunity to respond to the Approval Objection, as pleaded in the Rebutter, with any responding evidence (i.e., the Claimants\u2019 9 September Response). Finally, the Respondent was given a right of reply with reply evidence, due by 23 September 2013, which was eventually filed on 26 September 2013 (i.e., the Respondent\u2019s 26 September Reply).\n\n364.\n\nIn its Re-Rebutter, the Respondent pleaded that Article 9(a) of the German BIT, Article 2 of the Swiss BIT and ICSID case law require compliance with local law \"Rules of the Game\", which the Respondent contended Include (see Re-Rebutter, \u00a7 1.1.4, 1.1.5 and 1.1.6):\n\n\u2022 the FIC procedure and subsequently the ZIA procedure described by Mr. Nyaguse, as well as Article 13 of the 2006 Zimbabwe Investment Authority Act (CLEX-59);\n\n\u2022 The ZSE Rules free float rule, requiring that 30% of a listed company\u2019s shares be part of the free float (R-83/CLEX-435); and\n\n\u2022 The Zimbabwe Exchange Control Regulations 1996, and their predecessor Exchange Control Regulations 1977 (R-86/CLEX-428).\n\n365.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Respondent alleged as follows in connection with approvals by the FIC or the ZIA (see Re-Rebutter, para. 19):\n\nClaimants\u2019 self-declared standard is best recorded in Claimants Rudiger\u2019s affirmation that \u2018there appeared to be a realisation that foreign Investment was needed in the Republic, and the government appeared to want it.\u2019 Claimants thus neither applied for nor received the required approval from the ZFIC or ZIA. What is not on the record is as important as what is on the record. Claimants have submitted no relevant approval, neither having obtained \u2018foreign Investment\u2019 status at the time of acquisition of their holdings nor at the entry Into force of the German BIT on 14 April 2000 or at entry Into force of the Swiss BIT on 9 February 2001.\n\n366.\n\nRegarding the ZSE Rules, the Respondent alleged on the basis of Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s evidence57 that the shareholding in Border was not allowed under the ZSE Rules and that the Claimants had themselves admitted that the ZSE Rules applied to their acquisition of Border but they had disregarded the rules. The Respondent referred to the fourth Witness Statement of Heinrich von Pezold (C-682)58 and to the Claimants\u2019 Reply59.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Joseph Kanyekanye, R-04, para. 48 (in regard to the valuation of Border:.. It is important to note that the shareholding shown is not allowed under ZSE rules and in any case it was apparently done as a way of ring fencing the asset ahead of the Indenization and Empowerment Act promulgated on 7 March 2008 plus fighting land reform where the State compensates for land covered by BIPPAS and Fourth Witness Statement of Joseph Kanyekanye, R-13, para. 33 (Mr. Kanyekanye queries whether the 1992 further acquisition of shares in Border was \"corrupt\" as a transaction between a son-in-law and his in-laws).\n\nHeinrich stated as follows at para. 79 of his fourth Witness Statement:  \n Mr Kanyekanye states that the shareholding set out in Mr Levitt\u2019s First Report \"is not allowed under the ZSE rules\". I agree that Border does not comply with the ZSE rule that requires that 30% of a listed company\u2019s shares are part of the free float (the \"free float\"). Given that Border does not have a free float of 30%, in 2004 it attempted to take the company private and de-list it from the ZSE. However, the Reserve Bank denied exchange control approval for the transaction, and it was therefore not possible to complete the transaction and request de-listing from the ZSE.\n\nIn their Reply, at paras. 347 and 354, the Claimants wrote as follows:  \n Mr Kanyekanye\u2019s report grossly undervalues the Border Estate. Based on the market capitalisation of Border on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), Mr Kanyekanye opines that the Border Estate has an \"as is\" value of US$6,763,443 as at 2012.694 Mr Kanyekanye has provided very minimal Information as to how he arrived at his valuation of the Border Estate. Therefore there is very little to analyse, and the Claimants\u2019 response as a consequence can only be general in nature. A more detailed response, if possible, will be in Mr Levitt\u2019s second expert report.  \n...  \n The market capitalisation of Border is a wholly inappropriate tool to establish the fair market value of the Border Estate. The reason for this is that Border was 86.49% owned by one family (namely the von Pezold Claimants - two families since the Second Joint Venture). Therefore the balance of 13.51% (the \"free float\") in the hands of minority shareholders means that it is a very Illiquid (thinly traded) stock, i.e. market trades have very little, if any, influence on the price of Border\u2019s shares. Moreover, Border has not paid any dividends for a number of years. Therefore with no appreciation in share price (because the shares are thinly traded), and no payment of dividends, Border naturally has a market capitalisation which is a fraction of its underlying assets.\n\n367.\n\nRegarding the Exchange Control Regulations, the Respondent referred to its 4 July and 29 July letters where it had alleged that the ZSE Rules are inter-related with the Exchange Control Regulations, and in particular that s. 17 of the Exchange Control Regulations 1996 (CLEX-38), which provides that \"[s]ubject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed, a listed security may be issued or transferred to a foreign resident or his nominee\" (Respondent\u2019s emphasis), refers to the ZSE Rules (see Re-Rebutter, para. 25). The Respondent alleged on the basis of Heinrich\u2019s evidence that Reserve Bank exchange control approval had been denied in connection with the \"acquisition of Border\" and referred to its earlier allegations in the Rebutter that the exchange control approval had similarly not been obtained or had been evaded inrespect of the Loans extended to Forrester Estate (see Re-Rebutter, paras. 25-27).\n\n368.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent argued that:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Border does not qualify as a protected Investment because no approval for the acquisition was obtained from the FIC or ZIC, was \"corrupt\"60, was in violation of the Exchange Control Regulations and the ZSE Rules;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Forrester does not qualify as a protected Investment because no approval for the acquisition was obtained from the FIC or ZIC;\n\n\u2022 Elisabeth\u2019s Loans to the Forrester Estate do not qualify as a protected Investment (no specific law or approval mechanism was Invoked, although It is suggested the Forrester Loans are not protected because they are not \"Investments\" on the *Salini* criteria and in the Rebutter It had been alleged in connection with the Approval Objection that exchange control approval had not been obtained); and\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Makandi does not qualify as a protected Investment because no approval for the acquisition was obtained from the FIC or ZIC.\n\nThis appears to be an allegation that the 1992 further acquisition of Border shares was not arm\u2019s length.\n\n369.\n\nIn their response (the **\"Re-Rebutter\"),** the Claimants argued that the Approval Objection is an admissibility objection, not a jurisdictional objection, and Invoked the MFN provisions of the Swiss BIT and the Danish-Zimbabwe BIT, which do not contain any approval procedure such as the one set out in Article 9(b) of the German BIT61. The Claimants also submitted the following inresponse to the evidence of Mr. Nyaguse (see Claimants 9 September Response, paras. 4-12):\n\nThe Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) : The FIC was an Informal grouping that had no statutory basis to It, and its decisions did not have the force of law. In any event, on Mr Nyaguse\u2019s own evidence, the FIC\u2019s purported remit only extended to \"new projects\". All of the Investments made by the Claimants were into existing projects, albeit Improve them;\n\nThe Zimbabwe Investment Centre Act 1993 : The 1993 Act created the Zimbabwe Investment Centre and the Investment Committee. Under the 1993 Act, local and foreign Investors could submit \"project proposals\" for approval in order to obtain perceived advantages from the Government. This was not compulsory, but merely a condition of receiving such incentives;\n\nThe Exchange Control Review Committee : The Exchange Control Review Committee was created by statutory regulation to hear appeals on exchange control matters. The Exchange Control Review Committee did not have any remit under the laws of Zimbabwe to approve foreign Investment. In any event, the Claimants\u2019 investments have never diluted local control of an enterprise. Therefore on Mr Nyaguse\u2019s own evidence, the Claimants did not require the approval of the Exchange Control Review Committee;\n\nThe Reserve Bank and the Exchange Control Regulations : inregard to the Reserve Bank, it did have a role in regard to approving foreign investment, in so far as the investment engaged what will be referred to hereafter as the \"the Exchange Control Regulations\". The Exchange Control Regulations consist of the Exchange Control Regulations, 1977 (\"the 1977 Regulations\"), and their successor from 5 July 1996, the Exchange Control Regulations 1996 (\"the 1996 Regulations\"). The Exchange Control Regulations are explained by Mr Paul in his witness statement.\n\nUnder the Exchange Control Regulations, issuers and transferors of shares were required, in certain circumstances, to obtain approval from the exchange control authority, which was the Reserve Bank (see para 10 below). In particular, in regard to an \"issue\" of shares in a Zimbabwean company, if the issuee was not Zimbabwean resident, approval from the Reserve Bank was needed (s9, 1977 Regulations; s12, 1996 Regulations). Inregard to a \"transfer\" of shares in a Zimbabwean company, where either the transferor or the transferee (or their \"nominees\", if any) was not Zimbabwean resident, approval from the Reserve Bank was needed (s10, 1977 Regulations; s13, 1996 Regulations).\n\nUnder the 1996 Regulations, exchange control approval was not needed for transfers of shares in listed companies to foreign residents or their nominees so long as certain conditions existed. These are discussed in paras 72 to 79 below in the context of the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimants breached s17 of the 1996 Regulations.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s role as the exchange control authority for the purpose of the Exchange Control Regulations is established under Zimbabwean law. In particular, in regard to the 1977 Regulations, the responsible Minister for the 1977 Regulations (the Minister of Finance) was the exchange control authority. However, pursuant to s32 of the 1977 Regulations, the Minister delegated his powers to the Reserve Bank. In regard to the 1996 Regulations, the \"exchange control authority\" is defined in s2 of the 1996 Regulations as \"the Minister\", and the Reserve Bank to the extent the Minister delegates to the Reserve Bank. In 1997, the Minister delegated his powers under the 1996 Regulations to the Reserve Bank, other than in relation to appeals.\n\nTherefore to the extent that a foreign investment was obtained through the issue or transfer of shares and it came within the ambit of the Exchange Control Regulations, the issue or transfer of shares had to be approved by the Reserve Bank. The Claimants\u2019 evidence is that only one of their transactions was within the ambit of the Exchange Control Regulations and therefore required approval by the Reserve Bank (which was granted). The transaction is discussed in para 16 below;\n\nZimbabwe Investment Authority Act 2006 : in addition to relying on the Nyaguse Procedure, the Respondent also relies in its Re-Rebutter on CLEX-59. CLEX-59 is the Zimbabwe Investment Authority Act 2006 (\"the 2006 Act\"). Its purpose is similar to the 1993 Act. In any event, the 2006 Act did not enter into force until September 2006, after the Claimants\u2019 investments in the Estates had been expropriated, and long after the Investments had been made. Therefore the 2006 Act is not relevant to the Approval Objection or indeed the Illegality Objection, [footnotes omitted]\n\nAlthough not pleaded in the Rebutter or Re-Rebutter, in the first Witness Statement of Mr. Masiiwa (R-5), filed with the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Mr. Masiiwa stated that: as of 1996, the accessing of off-shore loans was subject to the 1996 Exchange Control Regulations which required prior exchange control approval. Mr. Masiiwa also referred to Directive RE-277, dated 3 August 2003, which purportedly directed all Authorised Dealers to declare to Exchange Control all active foreign currency loans that were approved by or registered with the External Loans Coordinating Committee or Exchange Control, failing which any loans not declared would not be recognized by Exchange Control and would be deemed to be non-existent. A copy of Directive RE-277 has never been produced onto the record of these proceedings.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimants also introduced additional evidence in connection with Exchange Control approval for the 1992 investment in Border (see Claimants\u2019 Re-Rebutter Response, paras. 16-17):\n\nOnly one of the transactions that resulted in the Claimants obtaining an interest in the Estates fell within the ambit of the Exchange Control Regulations and therefore required approval by the Reserve Bank. The transaction in question was the 25.65% Indirect interest that the Parent Claimants acquired in the Border Estate in December 1992. Pursuant to that transaction, a Belgian Bank\u2019s subsidiary transferred the issued share capital of the Zimbabwean company, Franconian Zimbabwe Investments (Pvt) Ltd (\"Franconian\") to the Jersey company, Saxonian Estate Ltd (\"Saxonian\"). Franconian was formerly known as \"Tanganyika Investments (Pvt) Limited\", and was a shareholder in Border Timbers Ltd (\"Border\"). Approval for this transfer was granted by the Reserve Bank in November 1992. The approval is evidenced by a letter dated 12 November 1992 from Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited to Tanks Groups Services Limited (which was a member of the Belgian bank\u2019s group). The Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited was an \"authorised dealer\" pursuant to the 1977 Regulations, and was responsible for liaising between the Reserve Bank and the parties to the transfer.\n\nTherefore when the laws of Zimbabwe required formal approval under the Exchange Control Regulations, the Claimants obtained it. However, the Respondent in its Re-Rebutter alleges that two further transactions required approval under the Exchange Control Regulations - it is incorrect. The first is the Loans to the Forrester Estate (see paras 60 to 61 below). The second is the acquisitions that took the von Pezolds\u2019 Interest in Border beyond 70% (see paras 70 to 79 below).\n\n371.\n\nAs regards the Illegality Objection, the Claimants also argued that the issue is one of admissibility, not jurisdiction (see Claimants\u2019 Re-Rebutter Response, para. 31) and extended their estoppel argument pleaded in connection with the Approval Objection in their Surrejoinder to apply also to the Illegality Objection (see Claimants\u2019 Re-Rebutter Response, para. 80).\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimants also responded to the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimants\u2019 investment in Border violated the ZSE Rules free float rule (see Claimants\u2019 Re-Rebutter Response, paras. 45-52).\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimants further responded to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the Claimants\u2019 investments in Border and the Forrester Estate, and the Loans made by Elisabeth in connection with Forrester Estate, failed to comply with the 1996 Exchange Control Regulations and Directive RE-277 (see Claimants\u2019 Re-Rebutter Response, paras. 60-69).\n\n374.\n\nAs regards the Border Estate, the Claimants submitted (see Claimants\u2019 Re-Rebutter Response, paras. 79):\n\n79. In summary, the prescribed terms and conditions referred to ins17 of the 1996 Regulations are contained in the 1996 Order not the ZSE Rules. Therefore the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimants breached the ZSE free float rule cannot be the basis of an allegation of a breach of s17 of the 1996 Regulations. Further, the Respondent does not allege that the 1996 Order was breached, and indeed it was not. In the circumstances, the allegation that the Claimants have breached the Legality Articles in regard to Border by reason of not complying with the ZSE free float rule and in turn s17 of the 1996 Regulations is unsubstantiated and indeed is incorrect. In any event, a breach of s17 is not a breach of a fundamental legal principle of the host State\u2019s laws (see para 33 above). In particular, there is no suggestion that a failure to comply with s17 is tantamount to \"fraudulent misrepresentation or the dissimulation of true ownership\" (see Desert Lines, para 22 above).\n\n375.\n\nOn 26 September 2013, the Respondent filed its reply submission **(\"Re-Rebutter Reply\"),** its application for additional pages to address allegedly new arguments raised by the Claimants in their Re-Rebutter Response having been denied by the Tribunal In PO No. 8.\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Re-Rebutter Reply was accompanied by a second Witness Statement from Mr. Nyaguse (R-85)62 and a third Witness Statement from Mr. Masiiwa (R-82), in which Mr. Masiiwa purported to give evidence in connection with the compliance of the Border investment with the ZSE Rules. That evidence, and the pleadings which rely on It, were eventually ruled inadmissible in PO No. 963. The Respondent argued as follows in connection the FIC/ZIA approval issue:\n\n19. Claimants\u2019 characterisation of the FIC as \u00ab the Nyaguse Procedure \u00bb shows their lack of respect for local Rules. Claimants have no difficulty seeing the waste effluent controller as representative of the State, yet they consider the FIC *I ZIA* to be of no use although the FIC / ZIC, as an interministerial Committee, is a governmental unit of the State of Zimbabwe.\n\nClaimants\u2019s characterisation of FIC is Incorrect. Mr. Nyaguse\u2019s 2nd Witness Statement (R-85) and Zimbabwe\u2019s \"Foreign Investment, Policy, Guidelines and Procedures, Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe, September. 1982, Cmd. R.Z.) 1982.], Printed by the Government Printer, Harare\"(R-91) irrefutably prove Respondent\u2019s position: FIC is not a mere \"informal procedure,\" but published government Policy, Guidelines and Procedures.\n\n20. Claimants (\u00b65 CR 9/9/2013) recognise FIC /ZIC procedures to be \"a condition of receiving... Incentives\" (cf. list of \"incentives \u00b67, R-85: \"incentives which the government extended to officially recognised foreign investors, like remittability of dividends, remittances on disinvestment, tax breaks...\"). Mr Nyaguse\u2019s \u00b612 (R-85) responds to Claimants, explaining the relevance of FIC *I* ZIC and consequences on this case:\n\n\"12. Any acquisitions not approved by FIC or ZIC were not therefore considered to have been approved in the sense of being admitted after presentation and examination of a given project by the State of Zimbabwe. Such acquisitions, while lawful and valid, were not approved in the sense of protected foreign investments notwithstanding that the general public treated such foreigners as owners so long as... pursued lawful activity.\"\n\nThe Parties agreed, in advance of the issuance of PO No. 9, that the entirety of Mr. Nyaguse\u2019s second Witness Statement was admissible and might remain unredacted on the record.\n\nSee PO No. 9, para. 56.\n\n377.\n\nOn 22 September 2013, the Respondent brought an application in connection with its Re-Rebutter Reply, which was originally scheduled to be filed on 23 September 2013, seeking permission to address in pages beyond the page limit set for its reply three \"new\" items, namely:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 invocation of the Swiss and Danish MFN clauses in connection with Article 9(b) of the German BIT;\n\n\u2022 The treatment of the Approval and Illegality Objections as objections to admissibility as opposed to jurisdiction; and\n\n\u2022 The extension of the Claimants\u2019 estoppel argument pleaded in their Surrejoinder to Article 9(a) of the German BIT.\n\n378.\n\nThe Respondent argued that, if its application was not granted, it would consider that its right to be heard had not been respected.\n\n379.\n\nIn PO No. 8, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent\u2019s application, reasoning as follows:\n\n13. The Tribunals do not consider the Claimants\u2019 9 September Response to be inconsistent with or contrary to the directions issued to the Parties in Procedural Order No. 7 such that the Tribunal\u2019s directions must be reconsidered or amended. The arguments inquestion are clearly responsive to the Respondent\u2019s new jurisdictional objections, admitted by the Tribunals in Procedural Order No. 7 and pleaded fully for the first time in the Respondent\u2019s Re-Rebutter. The Claimants are entitled to defend those jurisdictional objections, even if this means raising a defence or defences that have not previously been pleaded. This is a consequence of raising new jurisdictional objections at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n14. The Respondent has been afforded ample opportunity to present its case and to defend the Claimants\u2019 claims. In Procedural Order No. 3, the Respondent\u2019s challenges to jurisdiction, as pleaded for the first time in the Rejoinder, were admitted. In Procedural Order No. 7, the Respondent was permitted to raise additional jurisdictional objections at an even later stage of the proceedings, was given an opportunity to present those objections cogently in a supplemental pleading to its Rebutter, and was given a right of reply to the Claimants\u2019 9 September Response. The Respondent now seeks additional pages for this last submission to expand on how, in its view, certain cases cited in its Reply in response to the arguments raised by the Claimants in their 9 September 2013 Response \"enlighten the debate\" between the Parties in respect of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections.\n\n15. The Tribunals are not persuaded that it is necessary or appropriate at this stage to re-open the directions set out in Procedural Order No. 7 so as to afford the Respondent additional pages to plead its reply to the Claimants\u2019 9 September Response. The Respondent\u2019s Procedural Request is therefore denied.\n\n16. The Tribunals are of the view that in so denying the Procedural Request, the Respondent\u2019s right to be heard is not in any way impinged. In addition to the multiple opportunities afforded to the Respondent to plead its jurisdictional objections in relation to Article 9(a) and 9(b) of the German BIT and Article 2 of the Swiss BIT in writing, the Respondent is also entitled to make submissions on both law and evidence on the record in respect of these objections during the oral hearing, scheduled to commence on 28 October 2013, and in any post-hearing procedures that may be agreed by the Parties and the Tribunals or decided by the Tribunals.\n\n380.\n\nIt is important to note that, in a letter dated 26 September 2013, the Respondent confirmed, by reference to para. 16 of PO No. 8, reproduced above, that it was \"satisfied by these means to be heard\" and confirmed that the Respondent did not Intend to make any application to exclude the Claimants\u2019 arguments.\n\n381.\n\nOn 15 May 2013, the Claimants\u2019 *quantum* expert, Mr. Levitt, filed corrections to his Second Report (CE-7), which led to the Claimants filing, also on 15 May 2013, a Corrected Request for Relief **(\"Cl. Corrected Request for Relief\")** reflecting consequential amendments to Heads of Loss 9, 10 and 13.\n\n382.\n\nIn a letter dated 22 July 2013, the Parties recorded their agreement that the Respondent should have a right to respond to Mr. Levitt\u2019s corrections and the consequential changes made by the Claimants, as well as a right to correct any errors in its own damages calculations, by 9 September 2013. The Parties also agreed that the Claimants should have a right to comment on such written response by 23 September 2013 (eventually agreed to be 26 September 2013, in parallel to the shift in filing deadline for the Respondent\u2019s Re-Rebutter Reply) (the **\"Parties\u2019 July 22 Agreement\").**\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimants reserved their right to challenge the admissibility of the Respondent\u2019s response, should the Respondent\u2019s response go beyond responding to Mr. Levitt\u2019s corrections and the consequential changes made, or go beyond correcting errors on its own damages calculations, or to respond to any material that is not responsive.\n\n384.\n\nIn a letter to the Parties on behalf of the Tribunal, dated 6 September 2013, the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary confirmed the Parties\u2019 July 22 Agreement, including the Parties\u2019 agreed briefing schedule. The Tribunal also directed that the Parties file skeleton arguments, pursuant to PO No. 3 and the Parties\u2019 July 22 Agreement, by 14 October 2013.\n\n385.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the Respondent submitted its response, as foreseen by the Parties\u2019 July 22 Agreement, being comprised primarily of a third Witness Statement from Mr. Moyo and a fourth Witness Statement from Mr. Kanyekanye (the **\"Respondent\u2019s 9 September** ***Quantum*** **Reply\").**\n\n386.\n\nOn 26 September 2013, the Claimants filed their comments on the Respondent\u2019s 9 September Response (the **\"Claimants 26 September** ***Quantum*** **Reply\").** in this submission, the Claimants stated that, apart from those specific parts of the Respondent\u2019s 9 September *Quantum* Reply which they agreed were in conformance with the Parties\u2019 agreement concerning submissions in response to Mr. Levitt\u2019s corrected damages report, the Respondent\u2019s materials should be disregarded for failure to accord with the terms of PO Nos. 3 and 7.\n\n387.\n\nOn 2 October 2013, the Respondent brought an application in connection with its Re-Rebutter Reply as well as its 9 September *Quantum* Reply, seeking confirmation that each of these submissions and their supporting evidence are fully on the record (the \"**2 October Application\").** The Respondent also sought leave to submit a legal opinion relating to its jurisdictional and \"BIT access\" objections and Zimbabwean legislation relating to these objections.\n\n388.\n\nThe Respondent brought a further application on 12 October 2013, seeking an order fixing a date for the Claimants to submit any further \"approval/illegality exhibits they may have \u2018overlooked\u2019 through 10 December 2013 with an unlimited number of pages of accompanying lawyer\u2019s pleadings\", along with a similar right of reply for the Respondent by 20 December 2013 (the **\"12** **October Application\").**\n\n389.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Parties agreed to the admission of certain materials filed with the Respondent\u2019s 9 September Response and 26 September *Quantum* Response, and each provided written submissions in connection with the remainder of the materials and pleadings in question.\n\n390.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal held a telephonic conference with the Parties on 11 October 2013, during which the Parties were invited to, and did, make extensive oral representations in respect of each of the requests contained in the Respondent\u2019s 2 October Application. The Respondent\u2019s second application was submitted a day following the date of the telephonic conference.\n\n391.\n\nPO No. 9 records the Parties\u2019 main submissions in connection with the Respondent\u2019s 2 October and 12 October Applications.\n\n392.\n\nDuring the telephonic conference held on 11 October with the President of the Tribunal, both Parties agreed that there was no reason to postpone the oral hearing of the two cases scheduled to commence on 28 October 2013. The main issue, as the Respondent saw It, was the Impact of the Exchange Control Regulations on the \"approval/illegality debate\". The Respondent alleged that the Claimants were attempting to persuade the Tribunal to \"muzzle the Respondent on Exchange Control Regulations and the legal consequence of the absence of relevant approvals on the outcome of this arbitration\". The Claimants, for their part, dismissed the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the wide-ranging allegations of breach of the Exchange Control Regulations that the Respondent now raised had been raised any earlier by the Respondent, averring that such allegations had been raised only for the first time in the Respondent\u2019s 26 September 2013 Re-Rebutter Reply. The Claimants therefore framed the fundamental issue as that being the fact that the Respondent never pleaded in its pleadings or in its witness statements before 26 September 2013 the \"wide jurisdictional challenge regarding the alleged breach of the Exchange Control Regulations and how it may affect the approval and illegality objections\". The Claimants further stated that, while they had agreed to post-hearing submissions, they did not agree to a further round of pleadings after the oral hearing.\n\n393.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 exchange in respect of their respective positions is reproduced in summary form at paragraphs 21-22 of PO No. 9. They read as follows:\n\n21. The Respondent stated, in the context of ensuring the Claimants\u2019 right to be heard, that there remains a single issue to be decided: the Impact of the Exchange Control Regulations on the approval/illegality debate. In this regard, the Respondent cautioned the Tribunals as follows:\n\n\"9) The Arbitral Tribunals must not forget that the question of approvals has given rise to at least eight (8) written submissions by Claimants: (i) Urgent Application of 20 December2013, (ii) 31 December 2012 letter, (iii) 301 pages of 1 March 2013 Surrejoinder, (iv) Mr Coleman\u2019s remark \"for the record\" at the close of the 21 May 2013 telephonic conference, (v) 18 July 2013 Application... Illegality and Approval Evidence, (vi) 9 September 2013 Response... approval and Illegality, (vii) Mr Paul\u2019s witness statement, C\u2014879 and (viii) C--585 [sic], among the most recent and the most important, on which Claimants\u2019 found their case both as to approval and legality. Claimants have thus written about \"approv\" at least 284 times, since Respondent\u2019s 14 December 2013 Rejoinder, yet they find it inappropriate for Respondent\u2019s expert on this question, Mr Masiiwa, to disagree with their conclusion that \"only one of their transactions was within the ambit of the Exchange Control Regulations.\" Disagreement in a contradictory debate is not unusual; what is extraordinary here is that Claimants are attempting to persuade the Arbitral Tribunals to muzzle the Respondent on Exchange Control Regulations and the legal consequence of the absence of relevant \"approvals\u2019 on the outcome of this arbitration. It must also be recalled that Respondent has \"invited\" or even \"challenged\" Claimants to submit any approvals they may have \"overlooked\", such as in Section 5.4 of Respondent 29 July 2013 letter, R-079.\" [footnotes omitted]\n\n22. The Tribunals Invited the Claimants to respond to the Respondent\u2019s October 12 Application. On 13 October 2013, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunals characterising the Respondent\u2019s October 12 Application as \"abusive\" and seeking its dismissal. As regards the Respondent\u2019s reliance on a 29 July 2013 letter, the Claimants averred that such letter does not raise the wide jurisdictional challenges regarding the alleged breach of the Exchange Control Regulations raised in the Respondent\u2019s September 26 Reply, insisting that such challenges were only made for the first time in the Respondent\u2019s 26 September Reply (the \"Claimants\u2019 October 13 Letter\"). Specifically, the Claimants stated as follows (see Claimants\u2019 October 13 Letter, paras. 4-6):\n\n\"4. In paras 146 and 147 of Section 6.2 of R-79, the Respondent merely makes limited allegations regarding sl7 of the 1996 Regulations and its alleged relationship to the ZSE Rules, i.e. the same limited allegations that it made in its Re-Rebutter. Therefore the Respondent is simply wrong when it states in para 4 of its 12 October letter that it is now only requesting through its 26 September 2013 pleading and evidence that there is \"only one question left for the Arbitral Tribunals to decide [, which is 1 that stated in Section 6.2 of R-079\". It is unacceptable for the Respondent to continue to engage in obfuscation as to what it has done in the past and what it Intends to do in the future.\n\n5. In any event, after R-79 was filed, the Respondent was granted, by way of P.O. No. 7, one further opportunity to file a pleading by 16 August 2013 (the Re-Rebutter) in order to state its final case regarding Illegality. It now admits that it failed to do so. Moreover, its Approval Objection was to remain confined to that as pleaded in the Rebutter, which did not raise the wide ranging objection concerning exchange control.\n\n6. The Respondent in its 12 October letter ignores the fundamental issue, which is that the Respondent never pleaded in its pleadings (or indeed stated in its witness statements) before 26 September 2013, the wide jurisdictional challenge regarding the alleged breach of the Exchange Control Regulations and how it may affect the Approval and Illegality Objections. Once again the Respondent seeks a further opportunity to do so by essentially requesting that Mr Masiiwa's Third Statement (filed on 26 September 2013) is read as a pleading, and that the Claimants plead to it after the oral hearing, with the Respondent putting in a further round of pleading in response. Although the parties agreed to post-hearing submissions in para 7.1 of their letter of 8 October 2013 (which has been provided to the Tribunals), they did not agree to a further round of pleadings after the oral hearing. It simply will not do for the Respondent to continue to flout the agreements it enters into with the Claimants and the Procedural Orders of the Tribunals. It is obvious to the Claimants that the Respondent will not comply with the new procedural timetable it suggests and which the Claimants oppose.\"\n\n394.\n\nIn PO No. 9, the Tribunal ruled on the admissibility of the various documents the subject of the Respondent\u2019s application. As regards to the Respondent\u2019s Approval/lllegallty Objections pleaded in its Re-Rebutter Reply, the Tribunal found that the Respondent had expanded its objections in breach of the Tribunal\u2019s procedural orders and in particular para. 55(i) of PO No. 3 and para. 62 of PO No. 7, as well as in breach of Arbitration Rules 31(3) and 41(1). The Tribunal did not find \"special circumstances\" to exist under Arbitration Rule 26(3) to warrant the admission of such an expanded defence at such a late stage of the proceedings. The Tribunal reached this decision in part on the basis of the Claimants\u2019 detailed chronology of the Respondent\u2019s pleadings, provided orally during the teleconference and reproduced at para. 50 of PO No. 9:\n\n50. The Claimants further explained as follows during the October 11 telephone conference in response to the Respondent\u2019s position that the question of approvals has been \"on the table\" for nine months, since 14 December 2012, when it was raised in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder (see Tr. Uncorrected, pp. 23-26):\n\n\"Mr. Fortier: Okay. Mr. Coleman, would you please reply to what Mr. Kimbrough\u2019s main submission is, that this Information has, in fact, been in your hands since December, 2012.\n\nMatthew Coleman: Yes, certainly. Well December 2012 is the date that the rejoinder is filed. And with the rejoinder comes from the first allegation that approval is needed. No approval procedure is set out.\n\nAnd secondly, there is no allegation regarding illegality. So that point we\u2019re not answering anything in illegality. We then get the rebutter, which says that the approval procedure is that as set out by Mr. [sounds like: Nlgussl], which is appearing before the foreign investment committee and [Ul] the Investment committee formed under the 1993 act. And then he also says that you may need to get permission from the reserve bank If you engage the exchange control regulations and you may also need to appear before the review committee. And then in that pleading in the rebutter, there is an allegation regarding illegality. But the allegation regarding illegality is simply that the failure to appear before the foreign investment committee or its successor, the Investment committee, makes the investment Illegal.\n\nThe next point is a very important point. There is no allegation in the rebutter that the exchange control regulations have been breached. In particular, there is no allegation that each and every purchase into the 3 estates is a breach of either the 1977 and 1996 exchange control regulations. We then get the re-rebutter, which, of course, is the result of procedural order number 7 where the respondent is asked to give a concise statement as to illegality. And it does so, and it does so in the following terms. And I\u2019ll set out what [Ul] in relation to each of the 3 estates, Forester, Border and McCandy.\n\nFirst, in relation to Forester, it says the Investment is illegal because no permission was obtained from the foreign Investment committee. It also says that the loans are illegal because they breach some unidentified provision of the 1996 regulations and a further provision which we\u2019ve never been provided, which is RE277, which we believe may be a directive of the reserve bank. But there is certainly no allegation that the purchases of shares in regard to Forester breach the exchange control regulations.\n\nMoving on to the Border estate, they say that the Illegality arises because we failed to appear before the foreign Investment committee or the investment committee. And then there is a very limited allegation in regard to the 1996 exchange control regulations. And the allegation of breach in regard to those regulations is they say that In 2003 when we made a further Investment, we breached the 1996 exchange control regulations because we did not follow the free float rule as set by the Zimbabwe stock exchange. There\u2019s absolutely no other allegation regarding breaches of the exchange control regulations in relation to Border for any of the purchases that were made from 1992 up to 2007.\n\nMoving on to the last estate, the McCandy estate, the only allegation there is that the Illegality has been caused by a failure to get permission under the 1993 act; in other words, the Investment committee. No allegation saying that the purchase of shares breached the 1996 regulations.\n\nWe then move on the latest pleading, which was filed pursuant to procedural order number 7, which is the 23 September 2013 pleading, in fact, filed on 26, 2013 with the agreement of the parties. And this is where the case is greatly expanded and one that\u2019s never been made before. And the expansion is that they now say that each and every purchase in all 3 of the estates overa period covering 1988through to 2007 now breaches the 1977 and 1996 regulations.\n\nThere is no specific allegation identifying which specific purchases may have breached and for what reason, it is simply a global challenge. And that greatly expands the case. It\u2019s one we\u2019ve never been asked to answer before, and to do so, we would need to go through each and every share purchase over a 25 year period. We would need to consider the regulations, which are somewhat complex, and then form a position on it. We haven\u2019t done so because we haven\u2019t been asked to do so.\n\nSo when Mr. Kimbrough says it\u2019s always been on the table, it simply hasn\u2019t been on the table in terms of the pleadings. Interms of our objection, while the basis of the objection is rule 313, it\u2019s a non-responsive pleading, 263, it\u2019s out of time and because it\u2019s a jurisdiction challenge, it\u2019s also out of time under 411. [Ul simultaneous conversation] my submission on that particular point.\"\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted the Claimants\u2019 view as to the likely effect of allowing the Respondent\u2019s arguments and evidence in connection with the Approval and Illegality Objections pleaded in the Respondent\u2019s Re-Rebutter Reply onto the record. Specifically, as set out in para. 49 of PO No. 9, the Claimants submitted as follows:\n\nThe objections are made on the basis that the Respondent raises new challenges to jurlsdlctlon/admlsslbility... In particular, it alleges that none of the Claimants\u2019 investments in the three Estates comply with the 1977 or the 1996 Exchange Control Regulations (\"the Exchange Control Regulations\"), i.e. It extensively expands the Illegality and Approval Objections. In particular, in the Re-Rebutter the Respondent only alleged that the 2003 investment into Border breached the 1996 Regulations by reason of the ZSE free float rule being breached, and that the Forrester Loans breached an unidentified regulation of the 1996 Regulations, and directive RE277... The Rebutter did not allege any breach of the Exchange Control Regulations in support of the Approval Objection. The expansion of the Respondent's argument is extensive, because in effect it covers each and every share purchase, between the period 1988 and 2005 that the von Pezold\u2019s made in the Zimbabwean Companies that make up the three Estates. In addition, it greatly expands upon those parts of the Exchange Control Regulations which it alleges are breached (previously it limited itself to s17 of the 1996 Regulations, which it mistakenly considers to refer to the ZSE free float rules ). It would take several months to analyse each of those purchases and collate the necessary evidence to respond. If it had been raised in the Re-Rebutter of 15 August 2013, the Claimants would have responded to it, but would have required an extension. [Tribunal\u2019s emphasis in PO No. 9]\n\n396.\n\nIn dismissing this aspect of the Respondent\u2019s application, the Tribunal also recalled para. 14 of PO No. 8, which stated that:\n\nThe Respondent has been afforded ample opportunity to present its case and to defend the Claimants\u2019 claims. InProcedural Order No. 3, the Respondent\u2019s challenges to jurisdiction, as pleaded for the first time in the Rejoinder, were admitted. InProcedural Order No. 7, the Respondent was permitted to raise additional jurisdictional objections at an even later stage of the proceedings, was given an opportunity to present those objections cogently in a supplemental pleading to its Rebutter, and was given a right of reply to the Claimants\u2019 9 September Response\".\n\nThe Tribunals considered the Respondent\u2019s invocation of Arbitration Rule 38 (2), which provides that, exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the Award has been rendered, reopen a proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points. At paragraph 54 of PO No. 9, however, the Tribunals stated that Rule 38 (2) relates to the emergence of \"new evidence\" after the closure of a proceeding on the basis of which the Tribunals would be justified in reopening the proceeding after having declared it closed. The Tribunals stated that this is not the case with respect to the Respondent\u2019s expanded illegality arguments. Specifically, the Tribunals found that \"these arguments do not spring from evidence that has recently come to light such that the Respondent could not, at an earlier stage of the proceedings, have raised and pleaded its objections within the time required according to the arbitration rules and the Tribunals procedural orders.\n\n397.\n\nOn 16 October 2013, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephonic conference with the Parties during which the Parties each made oral submissions inrespect of various hearing organizational matters. Among those matters addressed, the Parties made extensive submissions in connection with the allocation of time during the Hearing to address certain matters admitted into the record by PO No. 9. The Parties\u2019 agreement was recorded in a letter from the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary to the Parties, dated 17 October 2013 (the **\"October 17 Letter\"),** as follows:\n\n**V. Allocation of Additional Time to the Claimants Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9**\n\n18. In its Procedural Order No. 9, the Tribunals decided that the Claimants would be allocated additional time to address with Mr. Levitt on direct examination certain matters arising from (i) Mr. Moyo\u2019s third witness statement and (ii) Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement (see PO No. 9, paras 29 and 33). As envisioned by Procedural Order No. 9, this matter was addressed during the October 16, 2013 telephone conference, and each party was given the opportunity to state its position as to how much additional time was to be allocated to the Claimants, and the manner in which this time was to be used.\n\n19. In this regard, the Claimants requested that the additional time afforded to them pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9 be used not only for the direct examination of Mr. Levitt, but also for the direct examination of Messrs. Bottger and van der Lingen. Specifically, the Claimants requested an additional allocation of 75 minutes, to be allocated as follows (i) 20 additional minutes to address with Mr. Levitt Mr. Moyo\u2019s third witness statement; (ii) 25 additional minutes to address with Mr. Levitt Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement; (iii) 15 additional minutes to address with Mr. Bottger Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement, and (iv) 15 additional minutes to address with Mr. van der Lingen Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement.\n\n20. The Respondent objected to the allocation of 75 additional minutes, submitting that an additional 45 minutes for direct examination would, in its view, be sufficient for the Claimants to address Mr. Moyo\u2019s third witness statement and Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement.\n\n21. The Tribunals, having considered the parties\u2019 respective positions, have decided to allocate 60 additional minutes to the Claimants to address Mr. Moyo\u2019s third witness statement and Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement. These 60 additional minutes shall be apportioned as follows:\n\na. 20 additional minutes to address with Mr. Levitt Mr. Moyo\u2019s third witness statement;\n\nb. 20 additional minutes to address with Mr. Levitt Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement;\n\nc. 10 additional minutes to address with Mr. Bottger Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement, and\n\nd. 10 additional minutes to address with Mr. van der Lingen Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement.\n\n22. For the avoidance of doubt, the Claimants will be allocated 60 minutes in addition to the hearing time allocated to the Claimants pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement. Assuming a 34-hour total hearing time, as envisioned by the parties, the Claimants will therefore have 18 hours and the Respondent 17 hours.\n\n398.\n\nA further procedure was also implemented, and recorded in the October 17 Letter, governing the handling of written and oral pleadings and written and oral evidence on matters ruled to be Inadmissible In PO No. 9. This procedure was set out as follows:\n\n**IX. Compliance of the Parties\u2019 Written and Oral Submissions with Procedural Order No. 9**\n\n30. During the October 16, 2013 telephone conference, an issue was raised pertaining to the compliance of the parties\u2019 written and oral submissions and written and oral witness testimony with the Tribunals\u2019 decisions as reflected in Procedural Order No. 9.\n\n31. Further to Procedural Order No. 9, and for the sake of good order as to the content of the record of these arbitrations, the Respondent is directed to review and to Identify with specificity the paragraphs or portions of paragraphs in(i) Mr. Masiiwa\u2019s second witness statement, (ii) Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth witness statement, (iii) Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fifth witness statement, and (iv) the Respondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument which contain evidence that has been declared inadmissible pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9. The Respondent shall provide the Tribunals and the Claimants, by no later than Monday, October 21,2013 at 12:00p.m. (noon) Washington, D.C. time, with corrected versions of Mr. Masiiwa\u2019s second witness statement, Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s fourth and fifth witness statements and the Respondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument with all material determined to be Inadmissible pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9 blacked out. The Claimants will then have 24h to provide the Tribunals and the Respondent with their observations on the corrected versions. Any remaining dispute, if any, will be resolved by the Tribunals.\n\n32. The parties are further directed to provide on the first day of the hearing updated, consolidated hyperlinked indices containing these corrected versions.\n\n33. The Tribunals will address the procedure which is to be followed in the event a party objects to oral arguments and/or wltness/expert examination or testimony on matters that have been declared to be Inadmissible at the outset of the forthcoming hearing.\n\n399.\n\nOn 28 October 2013, the first day of the Hearing, the President of the Tribunal recorded the following during his opening remarks, also disposing of an application brought by the Respondent on the eve of the Hearing to re-open PO No. 9. This quote, while lengthy, is relevant to the Respondent\u2019s further and more recent request in its Post-Hearing Brief to re-open PO No. 9 (see Tr. Day 1, pp. 10-27):\n\nIt's a matter of public record that there have been a multitude of procedural applications in these cases, particularly since the beginning of this year and, more pointedly, since December of 2012. And, as Chairman, I benefited greatly from the assistance of the Tribunals' Assistant, Alison Fitzgerald, and the Tribunals'\n\nSecretary, Ms. Nitschke, and we, in consultation with my co-Arbitrators, have done our utmost to deal fairly and as expeditiously as possible with all the many Applications which we have received. And I note that as late as yesterday evening, there were Applications which were submitted to the Tribunal by both Parties.\n\nMuch has been said about the due-process rights of the Claimants-of the Respondent in particular; and the fact that we, as a Tribunal, has in effect dealt over backwards in order to accommodate the many requests of the Respondent, demonstrates that we are conscious-very conscious\u2014about due process, fundamental Rules of Procedure, and I refer in particular to Paragraph 50\u2014that's five-zero\u2014of Procedural Order Number 3. I refer to Paragraph 57 of Procedural Order Number 7. I refer also to Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Procedural Order Number 8.\n\nIt may be appropriate at this point to reiterate what we wrote in Paragraphs 14 and 15 of Procedural Order Number 8, and I quote: \"The Respondent has been afforded ample opportunity to present its case and to defend the Claimants' claims.\n\nIn Procedural Order Number 3, all of the Respondent's challenges to jurisdiction, as pleaded for the first time in the Rejoinder, were admitted.\n\nIn Procedural Order Number 7, the Respondent was permitted to raise additional jurisdictional objections at an even later stage of the proceedings, was given an opportunity to present those objections cogently in a supplemental pleading to its Rebutter, and was given a right of Reply to the Claimants' 9 September response.\n\nThe Respondent now seeks additional pages forthis last submission to expand on how, in its view, certain cases cited in its Reply in response to the arguments raised by the Claimants in their 9 September 2013 response enlighten the debate between the Parties in respect of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.\n\nAnd we concluded: \"The Tribunals are not persuaded that it is necessary or appropriate at this stage to reopen the directions set out in Procedural Order Number 7 so as to afford the Respondent additional pages to plead its Reply to the Claimants' 9 September response.\"\n\nAnd we concluded: \"The Respondent's procedural request is, therefore, denied.\"\n\nAnd we added in Paragraph 16: \"The Tribunals are of the view that in so denying the procedural request, the Respondent's right to be heard is not in any way impinged.\"\n\nAnd we said: \"in addition to the multiple opportunities afforded to the Respondent to plead its jurisdictional objections in relation to Article 9(a) and 9(b) of the German BIT and Article 2 of the Swiss BIT in writing, the Respondent is also entitled to make submissions on both law and evidence on the record in respect of these objections during the Oral Hearing scheduled to commence on 28 October 2013 and in any post-hearing procedures that may be agreed by the Parties and the Tribunals, or decided by the Tribunal.\"\n\nSo, I thought it was important to recall those very clear statements which the Tribunals inserted in the many Procedural Orders that have been issued.\n\nOn the 15th of October of 2013, after having been briefed extensively by the Parties, we considered yet another application by the Respondent, and I chaired a hearing, telephonic hearing, with the Parties on the 11th of October 2013 during which the Parties were Invited to and did make extensive oral representations in respect of each of the requests contained in the application.\n\nAs the Parties know, this telephone conference was recorded and transcribed, and the audio recording and the transcript were provided to the Parties and the Tribunals. I recall that this telephonic hearing lasted a little over three hours.\n\nOn the day following the telephonic conference, the Respondent submitted a further application, and the Claimants were Invited to respond to the Respondent's October 12 application, which they did on 13 October-I recall that this was during a weekend-and, eventually, the Tribunal in Procedural Order Number 9, unanimously decided that certain requests of the Respondent should be granted and others should be dismissed. And I reiterate again that Procedural Order Number 9 runs to some 27 pages.\n\nAnd it was Issued on 15 October, a few hours before we held\u2014I chaired the Pre-Hearing Telephonic Conference on the 16th of October 2013, and this Pre-Hearing Telephonic Conference lasted nearly two hours.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn Procedural Order Number 9, the Tribunal had decided that the Claimants would be allocated additional time to address with Mr. Levitt on direct to the compliance of the Parties' Witness Statements, the Parties' Skeletons, with the Tribunals' decisions as reflected in Procedural Order Number 9.\n\nSo for the sake of good order, the Respondent was directed to review and to Identify with specificity the paragraphs or portions of paragraphs in, firstly, Mr. Masiiwa's Second Witness Statement; secondly, Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s Fourth Witness Statement; and Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s Fifth Witness Statement, as well as the Respondent's Skeleton Argument, which contains evidence which has been declared Inadmissible pursuant to Procedural Order Number 9. And the Respondent was Invited to provide the Tribunals and the Claimants by no later than Monday, October 21, 2013, with corrected versions of Mr. Masiiwa's Second Witness Statement, Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s Fourth and Fifth Witness Statements, and the Respondent's Skeleton Argument, with all material determined to be Inadmissible, pursuant to Procedural Order Number 9, blacked out. This was done, and I thank the Respondent for having compiled with the Tribunals' order.\n\nThe Claimants, the Tribunals stated, would have 24 hours to provide the Tribunals and the Respondent with their observations on the corrected versions. Again, this was done, and I thank the Claimants, and we said any remaining dispute will be resolved by the Tribunals, in fact, we have reviewed during the weekend Exhibit R-81\u2014Witness Statement R-81, which is Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s Fourth Witness Statement, and Witness Statement R-82, which is Mr. Masiiwa's\u2014have I got this right?\u2014Mr. Masiiwa's Witness Statement.\n\nHaving reviewed the corrections proposed the by the Respondent and the corrections proposed by the Claimant, the Tribunal has made a few more corrections, and those Witness Statements have now been filed in the record. They were sent to the Parties in the hour earlier this afternoon.\n\nI note for the record that Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s Fifth Witness State me nt-that's Exhibit R-93\u2014the revisions agreed by the Parties were confirmed by the Tribunal.\n\nI now come to the Skeleton. Again, the Skeleton submitted by the Respondent did not\u2014could not-take into account the decisions of the Tribunal recorded in Procedural Order Number 9, and the Respondent made a valiant effort to redact from the Skeleton those sentences, those passages, which, because of Procedural Order Number 9, should be declared as inadmissible.\n\nThe Tribunals' Assistant and the Tribunals' Secretary, aided and abetted by your Chairman, also made a no less valiant effort to perform that exercise during the weekend. We came to the conclusion\u2014and this conclusion has been endorsed by my two co-Arbitrators\u2014that this was going to be an impossible task to be performed thoroughly and in a fulsome way prior to 2:15 this afternoon.\n\nIn the circumstance, we have decided that the Parties' Skeleton Submissions would be admitted into the record; and, in the fullness of time, the Tribunal, informed by the clear terms of Procedural Order Number 9, will determine, during its deliberations, what needs to be redacted, what should be redacted, and what should remain as being admissible. This is a situation where the Parties are invited to trust the Tribunal, to trust the arbitrators to act in accordance with their conscience. We will do our conscious best to rule out any passages in the Respondent's Skeleton, which, because of the terms of Procedural Order Number 9, should be inadmissible and what should be admissible.\n\nSo, both Skeletons are admitted into the record provisionally, subject to what I have explained.\n\nNow, I mentioned in the course of the telephonic conference on the 16th\u2014that's right, on the 16th of October-that we, the Tribunal, were concerned about the procedure which should be followed in the event that a Party objects to oral arguments or Witness or Expert examinations or testimony on matters that have been declared to be inadmissible pursuant to Procedural Order Number 9. What we have decided, gentlemen, ladies, what we have decided is the following:\n\nIn order to disrupt as little as possible the proceedings-for example, the Opening Statement by one counsel or another-we don't want opposing counsel standing up like a Jack-in-the-Box every second minute or every five minutes and objecting to a statement or, indeed, part of a statement in his friend's statement or his friend's question or a witness's answer. What we have decided is the following:\n\nAfter the Hearing is concluded on Saturday, each side will be given an opportunity to review the transcripts and point out, in a submission to the Tribunal, point out simultaneously those passages in the record which it opines it views as being contrary to the clear terms of Procedural Order Number 9.\n\nWe will afford the Parties a second round to comment on its friends' first submission, and aided and abetted by these submissions, again the Tribunal will do its conscious best to proceed to its deliberations on the basis that the record has been redacted of all that, in the final analysis, it considers to be inadmissible statements or inadmissible evidence, and this will lead us to the issuance of an award/decision in due course.\n\nNow, following these two rounds of exchanges with respect to what in the record each Party views as being admissible or inadmissible, we will then issue a timeline for the submission of Post-Hearing Briefs, and this will lead us to a date certain, probably, realistically in early 2014, when we will commence our deliberations on the basis of a record which is not replete with inadmissible statements or inadmissible evidence.\n\nNow, I have to deal, as Chairman, with the Applications which we received yesterday evening. I refer firstly to the Claimants' application which, as a result of the Respondent's reply submitted on time this morning and for which I thank the Respondent, it is obvious to us that the Claimants' application has become moot, and I so declare. Yes, Mr. Coleman.\n\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, I confirm that's correct.\n\nPRESIDENT FORTIER: Thank you very much. Now, with respect to the Respondent's application, again it has been considered by Members of the Tribunal very carefully, both yesterday evening and this morning, we have also considered the Claimants' Reply received earlier today and bearing today's date, and we have deliberated, and we have decided unanimously that Procedural Order Number 9 should stand as it is, that it should not be revisited, that it should not be modified. Simply put: Procedural Order Number 9 is part of the law of these cases.\n\nIt is not irrelevant in that context to recall the terms of what was, in 1976, Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. Parties will recall that it said that\u2014it provided that the Parties should be treated with equality, and each Party shall be given full opportunity of presenting its case. When the UNCITRAL Rules were amended, revised in 2013, the word \"full\" was replaced with the word \"reasonable\": \"The Parties shall be treated with equality and each Party shall be given reasonable opportunity of presenting his case. Now, there is no doubt that a reference to Rule 50(3)(b) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is appropriate in this connection.\n\nAs is well-known to the Parties, that provision reads that annulment, if in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention, if it is not can be granted If there has been a serious departure from a fundamental Rule of Procedure,\" and we are of the view that the Respondent has been granted every reasonable opportunity of presenting its case and that there is no need to revisit Procedural Order Number 9.\n\nThe opportunity which the Respondent\u2014that the Tribunal considers that it has discharged its duty to the full to provide a reasonable opportunity to the Respondent to present its case throughout these proceeding, and that is the reason why we have decided that the Respondent's request of yesterday's date, Respondent's application should be denied and that PO Number 9 should stand. [emphasis added]\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that on the final day of the Hearing, the Respondent confirmed its satisfaction that it had been treated fairly and had had its \"day in court\" (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1875-1878):\n\nPRESIDENT FORTIER: Mr. Kimbrough, I ask you the same question: Are you satisfied with the way the hearing has been conducted and comfortable that your clients have had their day in court before these two Tribunals?\n\nMR. KIMBROUGH: Sir, the conditions here in the ICSID facility have been excellent. All of the parties, Ms. Nitschke, has been very cooperative, and photocopies, and we have absolutely no complaint.\n\nIf I have any reservation, it is simply to reiterate the\u2014I think it-was it psychological or philosophical discomfort of Minister\u2014\n\nMR. MOREAU: Spiritual.\n\nMR. KIMBROUGH: Spiritual\u2014the spiritual discomfort of Minister Mutasa. We sincerely regret that external circumstances that we view with a certain criticism for hypocrisy to-not to say the visa was refused on the part of the American authorities and then to hand it to him as he went into a situation which was both humiliating and hostile. I'm not here to give testimony but I've worked with him several times and in totally reasonable man theory. And I saw him\u2014the French have an expression \"bont de femme\" (phonetic). I've seen him as a \"bont font de femme\" (phonetic). He was under great stress. I had-because I knew all of the past of this Tribunal, I had a very uncomfortable situation of not having spoken with him one minute before and having-with 40 spectators to tell him that I gave him advice to go on. I think that a portion of his tone and excitement were directly linked to those circumstances, and so he has made his reservation on the record. I reiterate that, and I simply ask the Arbitral Tribunal to take into full consideration those extremely unusual circumstances and to consider that in their view of the overall situation.\n\nPRESIDENT FORTIER: Absolutely. And I think you will recognize that we were also, the Tribunals, through me, was also uncomfortable with the way this matter arose and, of course, you recognize this. This is a matter over which the Tribunals had no control whatsoever.\n\nMR. KIMBROUGH: We do understand that. The comment is not toward the Tribunals. It is to underline the external force that we think was extremely unpleasant for the Minister and allowed the Respondent to present its materials to these Tribunals with a relatively severe handicap.\n\nPRESIDENT FORTIER: But at the end of the day as the Minister said himself, he thought he was treated with respect and given a full opportunity to answer all the questions that were put to him.\n\nMR. KIMBROUGH: Ms. Berry did serve him tea as well.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT FORTIER: So insofar as this matter is concerned, that you have explained and, over which, as you acknowledged, the Tribunals had no control, are you satisfied on behalf of your clients that Zimbabwe has had its day in court and it has been treated fairly?\n\nMR. KIMBROUGH: Yes, sir.\n\n401.\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Tribunal Issued PO No. 10, which settled the remaining disputes between the Parties in connection with the transcript correction exercise directed by the Tribunal at the end of the Hearing and admitted onto the record the supplemental documents provided by the Respondent in connection with Land Audits and the German BIT *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires.* The Tribunal also rejected, In PO No. 10, the Respondent\u2019s request that its Skeleton Argument be recirculated with the final redactions approved by the Tribunal in order that it \"know\" what \"Interpretation\" the Tribunal gives to PO No. 9. Inso doing, the Tribunal noted the following in regard to PO No. 9:\n\n38. The Tribunals understand the Respondent to suggest at page 2 of its 19 February Letter that by circulating a redacted version of the Respondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument inadvance of the Post-Hearing Submissions, the Parties will then - and only then - know exactly what Interpretation of Procedural Order No. 9 the Tribunals deem acceptable. The Tribunals disagree. Procedural Order No. 9, which runs 27 pages in length and decides matters that were extensively briefed in written and oral submissions, is both detailed and clear. Counsel for the Respondent confirmed during the Pre-Hearing Telephone Conference held on 16 October 2013 that Procedural Order No. 9 was \"very clear\" (see Pre-Hearing Telephone Conference of 16 October 2013, audio recording, at 1:48:33).\n\n39. Accordingly, the parties are directed to abide by the terms of Procedural Order No. 9 in preparing their Post-Hearing Submissions. No further or additional interpretation of Procedural Order No. 9 shall be given to the parties through redactions to the Respondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument. [emphasis added]\n\n402.\n\nThe foregoing summary is lengthy, but the Tribunal considers that it is vital for its unanimous determination that PO No. 9 should be reconfirmed again, and it so decides. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s request in its Post-Hearing Brief that the Tribunal\u2019s PO No. 9 be reconsidered is denied.\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s admissibility objections will be decided on the basis of those findings and that evidence which has been ruled admissible by the Tribunal in its Procedural Orders and other directions.\n\n(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n(i) The Approval Objection\n--------------------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Approval Objection is based on Article 9(b) of the German BIT64 which states that the BIT shall apply to investments that have been \"specifically approved by the competent authorities of the latter Contracting Party at the time of their admission\". The Claimants argue that Ad Article 2 of the German Protocol amends Article 9(b) or, alternatively, grants the required approval.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Approval Objection, as such, applies only to the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 claims and not to the Border Claimants\u2019 claims, which are advanced solely under the Swiss BIT.\n\n405.\n\nAd Article 2 states:\n\nInvestments made in accordance with the laws [of Zimbabwe]... shall enjoy the full protection of the Agreement. The preamble to the German Protocol notes that Contracting Parties have agreed on the following provisions, which shall be regarded as an integral part of [the BIT],\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this objection is only relevant to the German BIT - not to the Swiss BIT. Only one Claimant - R\u00fcdiger - relies exclusively on the German BIT, with all other Claimants bringing claims under both BITs.\n\n407.\n\nOn its face, there is an apparent conflict between Article 9(b) of the German BIT and Ad Article 2 of the German Protocol. In the light of this ambiguity, it is helpful to refer to Article 31(3)(b) of the *Vienna Convention,* which notes that, together with the context, the decision maker shall take into account \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the Parties regarding its interpretation\".\n\n408.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there are numerous examples of subsequent conduct by Zimbabwe (and Germany) which evidence the Parties\u2019 agreement that the von Pezold investments were protected by the German BIT.\n\n409.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that the Protocol does operate to override the approval requirement in Article 9(b) and therefore no specific approval is required. Although the Parties\u2019 intentions are not clear from the wording of the German BIT and the German Protocol, as neither document expressly overrides the other in the event of conflict, the Protocol was obviously written after the main BIT and was expressly intended to be regarded as an \"integral\" part of the treaty. The Tribunal therefore considers it reasonable to infer that the parties intended the Protocol to modify or add to the provisions of the BIT. Ad Article 2(a) would be rendered redundant if its effect was not to modify Article 9 of the German BIT.\n\n410.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties\u2019 submissions, including the Claimants\u2019 evidence of Zimbabwe\u2019s subsequent conduct, the Tribunal is persuaded that Zimbabwe and Germany intended for Ad Article 2(a) to remove the specific approval requirement that had originally been a pre-condition to protection under the German BIT.\n\n411.\n\nEven if this were not the case, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent is estopped from denying that it approved the Claimants\u2019 investments. Apart from the many informal statements of approval given by the Respondent and its organs (see para. 354 above), it is unclear on the evidence what the process would have been to obtain further approval. The Tribunal is not persuaded by the argument that approval from the FIC (or later the ZIC) was necessary. The FIC was not a statutory body and the Tribunal can find no evidence that suggests that FIC approval was required for BIT protection. The fact that the procedure was published in a document entitled \"Policy, Guidelines and Procedures\" rather than established through any formal act of parliament corroborates the Claimants\u2019 submission that it was a non-mandatory process. The Tribunal also notes Mr. Nyaguse\u2019s evidence that the purpose of this body was to consider \"new projects\", as opposed to investment in existing projects as occurred here. Similarly, ZIC approval appears to be required in order to obtain certain specific advantages (e.g. tax breaks). However, these advantages do not include BIT protection - if this were truly the required procedure under the BIT (as submitted by the Respondent), surely some evidence would exist to corroborate this submission. The Respondent has not produced any such evidence.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not consider that Reserve Bank approval was required to create a qualifying investment. In any case, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 evidence that Reserve Bank approval was only required for one transaction, and that it was obtained for the purposes of that transaction. The Claimants have sufficiently explained why their acquisition of Border shares did not meet the approval threshold. Overall, the Tribunal considers that the Reserve Bank arguments are more pertinent to the Illegality Objection than to the Approval Objection.\n\n413.\n\nWith regard to the Forester Loans, the fact that they were registered with the Reserve Bank would satisfy any requirement for approval. However, once again, the Tribunal cannot see any basis on which to find that Reserve Bank approval was required under Article 9(b).\n\n414.\n\nWith respect to the Border Estate and the allegation that a breach of the free float rule is relevant to the approval requirement, the Tribunal again considers that this is really an illegality issue. However, the Tribunal agrees with the position that the ZSE Rules were not part of the \"laws of Zimbabwe\" at the relevant time and therefore the \"illegality\" argument fails as well. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that neither ZSE nor Reserve Bank approval for any non-compliance with the free float rule affects its admissibility ruling. In any case, the Tribunal is persuaded that the ZSE was fully aware of any non-compliance with the 30% free float threshold and clearly took no action to sanction it. The Tribunal does not consider there is any basis on which to rule the Border claims inadmissible on the basis of the free float rule.\n\n415.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Approval Objection is dismissed.\n\n(ii) The Illegality Objection\n-----------------------------\n\n416.\n\nWith regard to the Illegality Objection, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Claimants breached any of Zimbabwe\u2019s laws, but even if they did, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Respondent is estopped from now denying that BIT protection exists.\n\n417.\n\nAs noted above, it is clear that no illegality argument can be sustained in relation to FIC or ZIC approval, as such approval was not mandatory and cannot be said to form part of the laws of Zimbabwe (let alone any \"fundamental legal principle\").\n\n418.\n\nArticle 13 of the *ZIA Act 2006* (which entered into force in September 2006) cannot be relevant to determining whether investments existed in the current case. The investments took place well before this date (primarily in the 1980s and 1990s) and the alleged expropriation occurred in September 2005. The *ZIA Act 2006* is therefore irrelevant.\n\n419.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded by the Claimants\u2019 arguments as to compliance with Section 17 of the 1996 Regulations (and the 1996 Order). Therefore, any allegation of a breach of the ZSE \"free float\" rule based on a breach of Section 17 cannot be sustained. The Tribunal does not consider the ZSE Rules to have formed part of the laws of Zimbabwe at the relevant time, and therefore any breach thereof would not be a sufficient basis on which to deny treaty protection. The Tribunal also considers that it would be inappropriate to deny treaty protection based on the fact that Border appears not to have had a 30% free float from well before the Claimants made their investment. Further, it is evident that any breach of the free float rule should have been dealt with by the ZSE itself, which had the power to invoke certain sanctions if it considered that the free float rule had not been complied with. Finally, there is clearly no support for any \"corruption\" allegation in relation to the free float rule.\n\n420.\n\nWith respect to the Forrester Loans, the Tribunal can see no basis for concluding that they did not comply with relevant rules and regulations. The Forrester Loans were registered with the Reserve Bank and appear to comply with its requirements. The Tribunal also agrees with the Claimants that, for the purpose of the legality requirement, when determining whether an investment exists it is compliance with the laws at the time the investment is made that is pertinent. Any subsequent alleged breach of law would not affect whether the investment qualifies for protection under the BIT.\n\n421.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal cannot find any basis for denying protection to the investments on the basis of a breach of Directive RE 277. The Tribunal recalls that this Directive has never been formally published and was not produced by the Respondent in these proceedings. The Tribunal is not satisfied that this Directive genuinely existed, but non-compliance cannot be a basis for withholding protection if the Directive was never made public and, in any case, as the Claimants pointed out, it imposed no obligation on the Claimants, and therefore could not have been breached by them.\n\n422.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Illegality Objection is also dismissed.\n\n(4) Respondent\u2019s July 2 Request\n-------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Respondent\u2019s submission of 2 July 2014 and the Claimants\u2019 Response of 9 July 2014. Two of the Respondent\u2019s \"procedural requests\" raised in its 2 July submission remain to be decided. Procedural requests (vi) and (vii), which were held in reserve by the Tribunal until the rendering of the final Award, state as follows:\n\n(vi) Declare that Claimants\u2019 assertions discussed herein constitute \"emergence of new evidence\";\n\n(vii) Declare that, under [ICISD Arbitration Rule] 26(3), \"special circumstances\" exist.\n\n424.\n\nThe new evidence identified by the Respondent relates to the oral testimony during the Hearing of R\u00fcdiger that the investments made by himself and Elisabeth in the Forrester Estate in 1988 and Border in 1992 required approval from the Reserve Bank (and, in the case of Forrester, that they obtained such approval).\n\n425.\n\nResolution of this issue turns on whether there is \"new evidence\", and whether that new evidence is significant enough to warrant exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3).\n\n426.\n\nHaving reviewed the portion of the Hearing transcript where this \"new evidence\" was allegedly advanced, the Tribunal finds the Respondent\u2019s characterization of this evidence to be inconsistent with the surrounding context of the cross-examination (which concerned the family motives for making the Forrester investment) and that R\u00fcdlger was not discussing whether approval was needed to make the investment itself. This line of questioning was separate from questions about whether R\u00fcdlger knew there was a procedure for specific approval (which questions were put to R\u00fcdiger in the cross-examination a few minutes later). Although it is not specifically stated, the Tribunal is nonetheless satisfied that the approval referred to by R\u00fcdiger during his cross-examination was the approval granted for the conversion of leasehold into freehold title.\n\n427.\n\nIn regard to the Border Estate, the issue is whether the transaction R\u00fcdiger referred to was one between the von Pezolds and the Reserve Bank, or, as the Claimants submit, between the previous owners and the Reserve Bank. R\u00fcdiger testified on cross-examination that (see Tr. Day 3, p. 691, lines 9-18):\n\nQ....\n\nI turn you to this exhibit marked C-52. You have the tab open, the organogram of Border. What date did you acquire Saxonian Estate Limited?\n\nA. Saxonian Estate as we acquired from the Soc\u00ed\u00e9t\u00e9 de General-I call them the vendors. They had various company boxes, but the beneficiary owner was Soc\u00ed\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in Brussels, and they had put the Zimbabwean Tank Assets [i.e. Franconian] into Saxonian Limited with approval of Reserve Bank, and afterwards, Saxonian Estate Shares were acquired by us.\n\n428.\n\nThe Claimants have explained that R\u00fcdiger had mistakenly interpreted a letter from the Reserve Bank as referring to his own investment, when in fact the letter was addressed to the previous owners of the estate (and was dated prior to R\u00fcdiger\u2019s Investment). The letter itself is dated 12 November 1992 and clearly does not relate to R\u00fcdiger\u2019s investment (see C-858). The Tribunal finds that R\u00fcdiger simply misconstrued the letter, as stated by the Claimants.\n\n429.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is no new evidence that would warrant allowing the Respondent to enter pleadings out of time. The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent has been granted numerous opportunities to amend its pleadings during the course of this arbitration. As the Claimants note, there is a degree of unfairness to allowing Respondent to submit a new pleading when the Claimants will not be able to address this at a hearing.\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s requests (vi) and (vii) are therefore dismissed.\n\n**G. Attribution**\n------------------\n\n(1) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, pursuant to Article 4 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility **(\"ILC Articles\"),** the conduct of the following State organs is attributable to the Respondent (see Mem., para. 1123): the President, Vice President, Ministers of State, Provincial Governors, Provincial and District Administrators, the Legislature, the Courts, the Central Bank, the Defences Forces (including the Army), the CIO, the Police, the Lands Committee (including Provincial Lands Committees), the District Development Fund, the Grain Marketing Board, and Agritex.\n\n432.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the acts of the Settlers/War Veterans are attributable to the State pursuant to Article 8 or, alternatively, Article 11 of the ILC Articles. The Claimants submit that it is not necessary, for the purpose of showing breaches of any treaty standard, to establish that the acts of the Settlers/War Veterans are attributable to the Respondent. The Claimants take the position that the placement of the Settlers/War Veterans on the Claimants\u2019 properties by the Respondent was a breach of the BITs and the fact that the acts of the Settlers/War Veterans once on the properties are attributable to the Respondent simply makes the treaty breaches \"more egregious\" (see Cl. PHB, para. 110).\n\n433.\n\nAs regards Article 8 of the ILC Articles, the Claimants submit that \"direction\" and \"control\" are synonymous, whereas \"instruction\" is distinct. The Claimants further submit that it is sufficient to establish either one of these. Referring to the ICJ\u2019s reasoning in the *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* case *(Bosnian and Herzegovinia v Serbia and Montenegro)*(see CLEX-224), the Claimants acknowledge that they must show that \"effective control\" was exercised over the persons who performed the acts which are alleged to give rise to wrongful conduct, or that the State\u2019s instructions were given in respect of each operation (i.e., the Invasions) in which the alleged violations occurred (see Cl. PHB, para. 111).\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the following evidence in support of their position that the State exercised effective control overthe Settlers/War Veterans and/or that the Settlers/War Veterans acted on the State\u2019s instructions (see Cl. PHB, paras. 112-115; Cl. Skel., paras. 88-89):\n\n\u2022 Minister Mutasa\u2019s admission that the Government had transported Settlers/War Veterans onto the farms, provided them with food and allocated them with units of land (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1415);\n\n\u2022 Minister Mutasa testified as follows (see Tr. Day 5., pp. 1415-1416):\n\nQ. Mr. Mutasa, it\u2019s Mr. Coleman for the Claimants. I just have some questions.\n\nMr. Kimbrough started off talking about events that happened in Zimbabwe around 2000, and I appreciate you said you very much wanted to help your own people.\n\nWhen people moved onto the farms, can you just please give us a brlef-- brief account of as to how you helped the people move onto the farms?\n\nA. Me, personally?\n\nQ. You and your Government, please.\n\nA. Are you asking about me, personally?\n\nQ. Sorry, your Government.\n\nA. When we\u2014we helped them to settle down, to give them where the limits of their land goes and also give them food during their initial stay, that was what I was referring to. We gave them seed and fertilizer in the initial stages of their work.\n\nEven now, we\u2019re still giving people seed and fertilizer to help them to settle down and make productive work on their farm.\n\nQ. And have you also helped them with transport to get onto the farms, or\u2014or any other assistance?\n\nA. Yes, indeed we would.\n\n\u2022 Professor Chan\u2019s evidence that, once the Invasions began, the Government mobilised quickly to provide material support to the Settlers/War Veterans, thereby expanding the Invasions beyond Masvingo Province (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 938-939, 949 and 969; Chan I, paras. 15, 32, 34 and 36, C-37);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Theron\u2019s evidence that vehicles with Government markings were used to transport Settlers/War Veterans onto farms (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 657-659);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s admission that the Government issued Offer Letters to Settlers/War Veterans instructing them to take up possession of the plots of land identified in the Offer Letter (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1246; CLEX-83);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi testified as follows:\n\nQ.... Do you accept that the Government sent people onto the property through Offer Letters? I\u2019m talking about the Offer Letter Process of Offer Letters being given out to people to go onto the three Estates? Do you accept that happened?\n\nA. Yes, people were given Offer Letters65.\n\nThe Claimants note in connection with Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s testimony that many of the Offer Letters were issued after September and November 2002, when the local courts had ruled that Section 5 Notices identifying land for expropriation were Invalid, and before the properties were expropriated pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment.\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi also testified as follows in response to Tribunal questioning (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1257-1258):\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: So, if these people went onto\u2014the Invaders, if I may call them that\u2014were on property which had not yet been expropriated legally, why would they be holding valid Offer Letters?\n\nTHE WITNESS: No, the Offer Letters they were given later after the property had been acquired.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: But at the time of the Invasion, they didn\u2019t have\u2014they could not have held Offer Letters or did they actually have Offer Letters?\n\nTHE WITNESS: No. At the time of Invasions, properties had not yet been acquired. No letter was valid.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: There were no Offer Letters.\n\nTHE WITNESS: There were no Offer Letters. Offer Letters were only made after the property was acquired.\n\n\u2026\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: So, what I\u2019m getting at is to ask you whether the Government ever had a policy of issuing Offer Letters before the expropriation had been completed. Before the acquisition [sic] been completed, did the Government issue Offer Letters?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Before listing the property, we didn\u2019t issue Offer Letters.\n\n\u2022 Heinrich\u2019s evidence as to the Government\u2019s effective control over the Settlers/War Veterans and instructions to them (see Heinrich I, paras. 575-583, 627; C-18); and\n\n\u2022 The findings of the Zimbabwean High Court in *CFU v. Minister of Lands & Ors* (2000) (see CLEX-76). For example, the Court stated the following at pp. 282-283:\n\n... Save perhaps for those farms whose owners have agreed to the takeover of their properties, the settling of people on farms has been entirely haphazard and unlawful. It has not been done in terms of a programme of land reform or in terms of the Act. A network of organisations, operating with complete disregard for the law, has been allowed to take over from Government. War veterans, villagers and unemployed townspeople have simply moved into farms. They have been supported, encouraged, transported and financed by party officials, public servants, the CIO and the Army. It has undoubtedly been an outpouring of reaction to years of frustration and economic hardship. Who is to blame for that frustration and economic hardship is another matter, and not for the courts to determine.\n\nOffer letters were documents from the Government which assigned parcels of land to War Veterans.\n\n435.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimants contend that conduct may also be attributable to a State pursuant to Article 11 of the ILC Articles if the State acknowledges and adopts it as its own. The Claimants contend that the Respondent admitted, in its Counter-Memorial, that it acknowledged and adopted the Settlers/War Veterans\u2019 conduct during the Invasions, referring to para. 156 of the Counter-Memorial (see Reply, para. 184, quoting CM, para. 156):\n\nTo arrest the situation Respondent reacted by putting in place legal instruments to enable the acquisition of more land for redistribution.\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimants note that \"putting in place legal instruments\" is a reference to \"Phase II\" (FTLRP) which began in July 2000, whereby Section 5 Notices were issued in respect of occupied and as yet unoccupied properties. The Claimants also note that regular statements were made by the President and other senior officials which acknowledged and adopted the Settlers/War Veterans\u2019 conduct (see Cl. PHB, para. 117; Cl. Skel., para. 93; Reply, para. 185; C-460; C-449).\n\n437.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s reliance on *Tradex,* the Claimants aver that the award in *Tradex* contains no analysis as to what constitutes the actions of a State and its officials, nor any analysis as to the liability of a State for the acts of its officials that are *ultra vires.* On the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the award, it stands for the proposition that there will only be a finding of wrongful conduct if the act or omission is attributable to the State (see Surrejoinder, para. 400).\n\n(2) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n438.\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to dispute the Claimants\u2019 assertion that the organs identified at para. 1123 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial are State organs. However, the Respondent takes the position that the Settlers/War Veterans are not organs of the State and there is nothing to show that the Settlers/War Veterans were acting as instruments of the State in complete dependence on the State, or that they were acting on the instructions or under the direction or control of the State (see CM, paras. 118-122).\n\n439.\n\nThe Respondent denies that its witnesses corroborated the Claimants\u2019 theory as to the Government\u2019s role in the Invasions. The Respondent avers that Minister Mutasa\u2019s testimony regarding the transportation of \"African Zimbabweans\" referred to new farmers settling down after land reform had been legislated. Similarly, the Respondent states that Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s testimony regarding Government Offer Letters to Settlers/War Veterans confirmed that Offer Letters were only given to \"African Zimbabweans\" after acquisition of their land from its previous owners (see Resp. PHB, para. 257).\n\n440.\n\nThe Respondent has also asserted that \"what matters is only the official acts by the State\u2019s officials\" (see Rejoinder, para. 1083). The Respondent relies upon the award in *Tradex* in support of its position, and, in particular, the *Tradex* tribunal\u2019s finding that speech encouraging villagers to occupy property was insufficient to hold the occupation attributable to the State (see *ibid.* *,* paras. 1084-1087).\n\n441.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the popular uprisings which took place in February 2000 are not attributable to the State but are the doings of the \"masses\", the Settlers/War Veterans and the ZANU-PF, each in opposition to the Government. The Respondent asserts that everyone agrees the land-hungry masses, squatters and Settlers/War Veterans were motors of the uprising, and many among them were ZANU-PF members (see Resp. PHB, para. 258).\n\n(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n442.\n\nArticle 4 of the ILC Articles states as follows:\n\nConduct of organs of a State\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under International law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ Includes any person or entity which has that status inaccordance with the Internal law of the State.\n\n443.\n\nIt is clear under Article 4 of the ILC Articles and the Commentary thereon that organs of State include, for the purposes of attribution, the President, Ministers, provincial government, legislature, Central Bank, defence forces and the police, *inter alia,* as argued by the Claimants. The Respondent does not seriously dispute this.\n\n444.\n\nResponsibility for the actions of these State organs is unlimited provided the act is performed in an official capacity (i.e., it includes *ultra vires* acts performed in an official capacity). Only acts performed in a purely private capacity would not be attributable. That issue does not arise in this case.\n\n445.\n\nAs the Claimants note, indirect liability for the acts of others can also occur under Article 4 - for example, the failure to stop someone doing something that violated an obligation. It does not matter that a third party actually undertook the action, if a State organ (such as the police) was aware of it and did nothing to prevent it. The Tribunal finds, on the evidence before it, that this is the case here, as regards police inaction in the face of Settlers/War Veterans coming on to the Zimbabwean Properties.\n\n446.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on Articles 8 and 11 in connection with the Settlers/War Veterans. Article 8 of the ILC Articles states:\n\nConduct directed or controlled by a State\n\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the Instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\n447.\n\nArticle 11 of the ILC Articles states:\n\nConduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\n\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\n\n448.\n\nWith respect to attributing acts of non-State organs to the Respondent, the acts of the Settlers/War Veterans do not appear to fall within the scope of Article 8 of the ILC Articles. While there is ample evidence of Government involvement and encouragement, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the acts of the invaders were based on a direct order or under the direct control of the Government when they initially invaded the Claimants\u2019 properties. Rather, the Government appears to have encouraged (and endorsed) the action once it had begun. Encouragement would not meet the test set out in Article 8. However, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the State action of encouragement and facilitation, etc. should be considered separately when it comes to treaty violations (this includes the inaction of the police). The actions of the invaders themselves need not be considered.\n\n449.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal does not consider that Article 11 applies in this case.\n\n450.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s objections relating to attribution, save for its objection relating to the attributability of the acts of Settlers/War Veterans to the State.\n\n**H. Proportionality, Regulation and Margin of Appreciation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n451.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the LRP and its foreign exchange policy were non-discriminatory and non-arbitrary regulations, applied in good faith, and proportionally, and argues that those measures therefore cannot give rise to wrongful conduct, that the Respondent should be given a wide margin of appreciation, and that it either had to \"fire upon the masses\" or bring about the aggressive phases of the LRP.\n\n452.\n\nThese principles appear to be raised by the Respondent both as defences which could preclude a finding of liability for its allegedly wrongful conduct and as a lens through which the Tribunal is invited to consider the alleged wrongful conduct.\n\n453.\n\nThe Respondent relies on two European Court of Human Rights **(\"ECHR\")** cases in support of its position that the Tribunal should give it a wide margin of appreciation as to its determination of what was required by way of land reform in the public interest and how the land reform was carried out. in particular, the Respondent refers to the following passage of the ECHR\u2019s judgment in *Jahn & Ors* v. *Germany*  ***(\"Jahn\")***(see CM, paras. 136, quoting RLEX-2):\n\n91. The Court is of the opinion that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the International judge to appreciate what is \"in the public interest\". Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the Initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities, accordingly, enjoy a certain margin of appreciation.\n\nFurthermore, the notion of \"public interest\" is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is \"in the public interest\" unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see James and Others, cited above, p. 32, \u00a7 46; The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, \u00a7 87; and Zvoisky and Zvoisk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7 67 in fine, ECHR 2002-IX). The same applies necessarily, if not a fortiori, to such radical changes as those occurring at the time of German reunification, when the system changed to a market economy.\n\n454.\n\nThe Respondent invokes the principle of proportionality in connection with a State\u2019s legitimate exercise of its police powers or \"regulatory powers\". The Respondent has observed that neither the Swiss BIT nor the German BIT addresses in any detail any limitation on the powers of Zimbabwean state regulation. The Respondent analogizes the present dispute to the *North American Free Trade Agreement* **(\"NAFTA\")** case of Waste\u00a0*Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*  ***(\"Waste Management)***(see ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, CLEX-208), citing the following paragraphs from the l/l/asfe *Management* award (see Rejoinder, para. 203, citing CLEX-208, paras. 98, 114-115):\n\n98. The Claimant affirms that the Resolution is arbitrary because the reasons Invoked therein to deny the renewal of the permit that had been granted on November 19, 1997 (the \u00abPermit\u00bb), under which the Claimant had operated the Landfill over the last year, are not proportional to the decision not to renew the Permit.\n\n\u2026\n\n115. To establish whether the Resolution is a measure equivalent to an expropriation under the terms of section 5(1) of the Agreement, it must be first determined If the Claimant, due to the Resolution, was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto \u2014such as the income or benefits related to the Landfill orto its exploitation\u2014 had ceased to exist. In other words, if due to the actions of the Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or economic use for their holder and the extent of the loss. This determination is important because it is one of the main elements to distinguish, from the point of view of an international tribunal, between a regulatory measure, which is an ordinary expression of the exercise of the state\u2019s police power that entails a decrease in assets or rights, and a de facto expropriation that deprives those assets and rights of any real substance. Upon determining the degree to which the investor is deprived of its goods or rights, whether such deprivation should be compensated and whether it amounts or not to a de facto expropriation is also determined. Thus, the effects of the actions or behavior under analysis are not irrelevant to determine whether the action or behavior is an expropriation. Section 5(1) of the Agreement confirms the above, as it covers expropriations, nationalizations or\n\n...any other measure with similar characteristics or effects...\n\nThe following has been stated in that respect:\n\nIn determining whether a taking constitutes an \u00abIndirect expropriation\u00bb, it is particularly important to examine the effect that such taking may have had on the Investor\u2019s rights. Where the effect is similar to what might have occurred under an outright expropriation, the investor could in all likelihood be covered under most BIT provisions.\n\n116. In addition to the provisions of the Agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal has to resolve any dispute submitted to it by applying international law provisions (Title VI.1 of the Appendix to the Agreement), for which purpose the Arbitral Tribunal understands that disputes are to be resolved by resorting to the sources described in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice considered, also in the case of customary international law, not as frozen intime, but in their evolution. Therefore, it is understood that the measures adopted by a State, whether regulatory or not, are an Indirect de facto expropriation if they are Irreversible and permanent and if the assets or rights subject to such measure have been affected in such a way that \"...any form of exploitation thereof...\" has disappeared; i.e. the economic value of the use, enjoyment or disposition of the assets or rights affected by the administrative action or decision have been neutralized or destroyed. Under international law, the owner is also deprived of property where the use or enjoyment of benefits related thereto is exacted or interfered with to a similar extent, even where legal ownership overthe assets in question is not affected, and so long as the deprivation is not temporary. The government\u2019s Intention is less important than the effects of the measures on the owner of the assets or on the benefits arising from such assets affected by the measures; and the form of the deprivation measure is less important than its actual effects. To determine whether such an expropriation has taken place, the Arbitral Tribunal should not\n\n.... restrict itself to evaluating whether a formal dispossession or expropriation took place, but should look beyond mere appearances and establish the real situation behind the situation that was denounced.\n\n\u2026\n\n(2) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n455.\n\nThe Claimants note that there has been limited adoption of the principle of proportionality by investment treaty tribunals and that, even where adopted, proportionality does not generally shield a State from claims. Following a review of those authorities relied upon by the Respondent, the Claimants submit the following (see Cl. Skel., para. 97, referring to *Jahn,* RLEX-2; *James & Ors v. United Kingdom,*  ***(\"James\"),*** RLEX-3; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States (*\"***Tecmed\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, CLEX-202):\n\n\u2022 A measure is disproportional If It causes the investor to carry an \"Individual and excessive burden\";\n\n\u2022 Racial discrimination will always be disproportional because it breaches a peremptory norm;\n\n\u2022 Illegal measures can never be proportional because governments do not have a mandate or the discretion to act illegally; and\n\n\u2022 Measures instituted by the State because of social or political pressures will not be proportional unless they are in response to a serious emergency and unless the Investor\u2019s conduct is a cause of that social or political pressure.\n\n456.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that evidence elicited at the Hearing establishes that the LRP lacked proportionality (see Cl. PHB, para. 121):\n\n\u2022 The effect of the LRP was to reduce the number of white farmers from 4,500 to 300 (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1183 - Tsvakwi; Tr. Day 5, p. 1372 - Mutasa);\n\n\u2022 The Claimants also note that 4,500 white farmers are carrying the land reform burden for 12 million people (see Cl. Skel., para. 98; *Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd. & Ors v. Zimbabwe,* CLEX-90);\n\n\u2022 Compensation was not paid for the expropriation of the Zimbabwean Properties (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1207, Tsvakwi; Tr. Day 5, p. 1402 - Mutasa); and\n\n\u2022 The LRP was not implemented as a result of a serious emergency (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1355 - Mutasa).\n\n457.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants say that evidence elicited at the Hearing establishes that the foreign exchange policy lacked proportionality (see Cl. PHB, paras. 122-124):\n\n\u2022 Mr. Machaya accepted the decision of the Zimbabwean High Court in *Zimbabwe Revenue Authority v. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe & Anor,* where the Court directed the return of funds taken by the Reserve Bank pursuant to its monetary policy and rejected the Reserve Bank\u2019s position that it had discretion overthe monies (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1989);\n\n\u2022 Messrs. Machaya and Masiiwa accepted that the decision of the Zimbabwean High Court in *Trojan Nickel Mine Ltd. v. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe* was correct in holding that the Respondent had no authority under Art. 35 of the 1996 Regulations to issue R1303 and that money taken pursuant to that directive had to be repaid (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1317 -Masiiwa; Tr. Day 5, p. 1489 - Machaya);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Machaya accepted the Zimbabwean Supreme Court\u2019s decision of October 2013 in the *China Shougang* case, which came to the same conclusions as the Court in *Trojan Nickel* (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1489);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Masiiwa disagreed with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *China Shougang,* but accepted that all amounts that had been taken by the Respondent pursuant to R 1303 must be repaid (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1316);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Masiiwa did not deny that there was a difference of more than 2% between Zimbabwe\u2019s Official Rate and Unofficial Rate between 2003 and 2009 and the differences breached Article VIIl(3) of the International Monetary Fund **(\"IMF\")** Articles (see Tr. Day 5, pp. 1292, 1301-1302 - Masiiwa); and\n\n\u2022 Mr. Masiiwa acknowledged that the differential would have created difficulty for the Claimants (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1305).\n\n458.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is irrelevant that a measure may be described as regulatory (see Cl. Skel., para. 101). In any event, the Claimants refer to the following evidence in support of their position that the LRP was carried out in bad faith (i.e. because of political and other interference) (see Cl. PHB, para. 125):\n\nMs. Tsvakwi accepted that the Provincial Land Committees included members of the ruling party (ZANU-PF) and representatives of the Army and the Police; she accepted that the Committees \"should have been composed of people who were completely independent\" (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1222).\n\n459.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that measures that are discriminatory on grounds of race are absolutely prohibited and therefore made outside the bounds of a margin of appreciation, and that the margin of appreciation cannot be invoked in regard to illegal conduct (see Cl. PHB, para. 126; Reply, para. 289). In any event, the Claimants submit that the margin of appreciation principle has developed in the context of human rights adjudication under the *European Convention for Human Rights,* and is not apt for use in the context of BIT claims (see Reply, paras. 282-297).\n\n(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Anaylsis\n---------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s argument that the doctrine of proportionality should be employed here to balance the competing interests of the State and the individual in the present case. Although proportionality has featured in some investment treaty cases, the context has generally been in relation to whether a termination (for example of licence or contract) by the State has been a proportionate response to an alleged breach of obligations by the investor. This is a rather different application of the doctrine of proportionality from that advocated by the Respondent in the present case, whereby proportionality is being used as a defence to what would otherwise be a violation of the BIT (i.e., expropriation without compensation). To suggest that the aggressive phase of the LRP was a proportional response to the situation in Zimbabwe at the time and, therefore, that any violation of the BIT should be excused would be a \"necessity\" argument (which is discussed below), not proportionality.\n\n461.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the following quote from *Tecmed,* referred to by the Claimants (see Cl. Skel., para. 97):\n\nIf the State instituted measures because of social or political pressures, such measures will not be proportional unless they are in response to a serious emergency, and unless the Investor\u2019s conduct is a cause of that social or political pressure.\n\n462.\n\nThe situation in this case would not meet the *Tecmed test.*\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses the Respondent\u2019s proportionality argument.\n\n464.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s case on regulatory powers, the Tribunal finds this line of argument -not fully developed by the Respondent in its pleadings - is also more appropriately addressed under \"necessity\". As the tribunal in *Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic*  ***(Saluka)***  observed, it inevitably falls to the adjudicator to determine whether particular conduct by a State \"crosses the line\" that separates valid regulatory activity from expropriation (see\u00a0*Saluka,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, para. 264, CLEX-217). Here, the Respondent has done little more than allege a regulatory powers defence, without clothing that allegation in any substance which would allow this Tribunal to determine whether the line has been crossed. Accordingly, this argument, too, is dismissed.\n\n465.\n\nAs to \"margin of appreciation\" and the Respondent\u2019s argument that it should be given a wide margin when determining what is in the Zimbabwean public interest, the Tribunal is of the opinion that due caution should be exercised in importing concepts from other legal regimes (in this case European human rights law) without a solid basis for doing so. Balancing competing (and non-absolute) human rights and the need to grant States a margin of appreciation when making those balancing decisions is well established in human rights law, but the Tribunal is not aware that the concept has found much support in international investment law. The Respondent has only referred the Tribunal to European human rights cases in its arguments.\n\n466.\n\nThis is a very different situation from that in which margin of appreciation is usually used. Here, the Government has agreed to specific international obligations and there is no \"margin of appreciation\" qualification within the BITs at issue. Moreover, the margin of appreciation doctrine has not achieved customary status. Therefore the Tribunal declines to apply this doctrine.\n\n467.\n\nIn any case, the Claimants have noted that neither the \"margin of appreciation\" nor the proportionality doctrine can be used to justify illegal conduct, such as a breach of an obligation *erga omnes,* by engaging in racial discrimination. As discussed below, there is ample evidence that the Claimants were targeted in the present case on the basis of skin colour.\n\n468.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to margin of appreciation are also dismissed.\n\n**I. The Alleged Treaty Breaches**\n----------------------------------\n\n(1) Expropriation\n-----------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n469.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached Article 4(2) of the German BIT and Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT, which contain the expropriation provisions of the respective BITs.\n\n470.\n\nThe Claimants submit that expropriation is unlawful unless the expropriation is for a public purpose, is non-discriminatory, is against prompt, adequate and effective compensation and follows due process. The Claimants further submit that:\n\n\u2022 A direct expropriation occurs when there has been a transfer of title to property to the State or to a third party, and that measures that take legal title but leave the former owner in control are an expropriation nonetheless (see Cl. Skel., para. 113); and\n\n\u2022 An indirect expropriation occurs when there has been substantial deprivation of the economic substance of the investment, without title being affected, and that a finding of indirect expropriation is not conditional on the investor no longer controlling the investment (see Cl. Skel., para. 114; *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August 2000, CLEX-184; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"Vivendi),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability, 30 July 2010, CLEX-229).\n\n471.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the following have been expropriated :\n\n\u2022 The Zimbabwean Properties were directly expropriated as of 14 September 2005, when the Constitutional Amendment vested in the State title to the 10 Forrester Properties, 21 of the 28 Border Properties, and six of the nine Makandi Properties66. The Claimants note that, without title, they are no longer able to sell or otherwise realise the properties, they face criminal prosecution for continuing to occupy them, and certain parts of the Estates are now controlled by Settlers/War Veterans (see Cl. Skel., para. 116). The Residual Properties were indirectly expropriated as of 14 September 2005 by the Constitutional Amendment, as they are not viable without the directly expropriated properties. The Claimants say that the operations of the Residual Properties would be disjointed and economically unviable when compared to their original unified investment, which used scale to produce returns, and their rights in the assets have been rendered useless (see Cl. Skel., para. 118).\n\n\u2022 The Income-Generating Assets and Zimbabwean Company Shares were indirectly expropriated as they have been rendered unviable and/or worthless on their own. The Claimants submit that Income-Generating Assets on the Residual Properties, including a pole treatment plant, two factories and a sawmill, have been indirectly expropriated because, like the Residual Properties on which they stand, these assets have been rendered unviable without the Zimbabwean Properties67. The Claimants also argue that the shares of the Zimbabwean Companies which held the Zimbabwean and Residual Properties have been rendered worthless, as the value of the companies depends upon enjoying the economic and legal benefit of the Zimbabwean and Residual Properties (see Cl. Skel., para. 119). The Forrester Water Rights were either directly expropriated by the *Water Act 1998,* with effect from 1 January 2000, or indirectly expropriated since the rights granted under the permits in place of the Water Rights under the *Water Act* are different and much diminished such that there has been a substantial deprivation to the economic substance of the von Pezolds\u2019 right to use public water for agricultural purposes (see Cl. Skel., para. 115).\n\n\u2022 The Forrester Loans were indirectly expropriated as of 31 December 2001, when the Respondent refused to release foreign currency to enable the repayment of the Forrester Loans to Elisabeth, or as of 14 September 2005, when the Respondent expropriated the assets of the Forrester Estate, thereby also preventing the Forrester Loans from being repaid (see Cl. Skel., para. 120).\n\n\u2022 Tobacco and its proceeds of sale (Forrester Estate) were either directly expropriated between 2004 and 2008 when the Respondent priced tobacco sales in US Dollars but paid the von Pezold Claimants in Zimbabwean Dollars at the Official Rate, which grossly overvalued the Zimbabwean Dollar, or else indirectly expropriated through the same process (see Cl. Skel., para. 121) (the **\"Forrester Tobacco Shortfall\").**\n\n\u2022 US Dollar bank deposits from tobacco sales (Forrester Estate) were directly expropriated when the Respondent refused to release proceeds from the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 tobacco sales in US Dollars, despite having promised to release 25% of the proceeds in US Dollars. The Claimants submit that these measures were illegal under Zimbabwean law because they were not authorized by a Minister (see Cl. Skel., para. 122) (the **\"Forrester Conversion Amount\").**\n\n\u2022 US Dollar export proceeds (Border Estate) were directly expropriated between 2004 and 2009 through the Respondent forcing the Claimants to sell a percentage of their US Dollar Border Estate export earnings to the Respondent in return for an \"equivalent\" amount of Zimbabwean Dollars based on Official Rates (see Cl. Skel., para. 123) (the **\"Border Liquidation Shortfall\").**\n\n\u2022 US Dollars from Border\u2019s account were directly expropriated as of 5 September 2008 when the Respondent, without authority, debited foreign exchange from Border\u2019s and Border International\u2019s bank accounts. The Claimants submit that these measures were illegal under Zimbabwean law because they were not authorized by a Minister (see Cl. Skel., para. 124) (the **\"Border Forex Losses\").**\n\n\u2022 The **Makandi Acquisition Rights** were indirectly expropriated as of 14 September 2005 when six of the Makandi Properties were directly expropriated, as the Makandi Acquisition Rights subsequently became worthless (see Cl. Skel., para. 125).\n\nThis also Includes the Water Permits in respect of the Forrester and Makandi Estates, which the Claimants submit were expropriated along with the Zimbabwean Properties on those Estates: see **Table 1** and **Table 3** of the Claimants\u2019 Reply. See paras. 186/187 above.\n\nThis also includes the \"Other investments\" described at paragraphs: 315 (Forrester), 478 (Border) and 541 (Makandi) of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, and include such things as investments in Irrigation, road infrastructure, and moveable and immoveable assets such as machinery, trucks and storage and curing sheds.\n\n472.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that on 17 January 2002, 6,000 tonnes of maize was seized by the Zimbabwean Grain Marketing Board from the Forrester Estate. The Marketing Board paid the Estate Z$15,000.00 per tonne for 4,500 tonnes of the maize, but the Claimants submit that the market price of the maize was Z$37,571,004. One thousand five hundred tonnes of the maize remained on the Forrester Estate, despite alleged attempts by the Respondent to remove the maize (see Mem., paras. 860-863) (the **\"Seized Maize\").**\n\n473.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the evidence of Ms. Tsvakwi and Mr. Machaya during the Hearing, during which both witnesses appeared to accept that all of the Claimants\u2019 Properties (both the Zimbabwean Properties and the Residual Properties **\"Claimants\u2019 Properties\")** have been expropriated (see Cl. PHB, para. 129; Tr. Day 4, p. 1183-Tsvakwi; Tr. Day 5, p. 1469 - Machaya). The Claimants suggest that the Respondent now accepts that all of the Claimants\u2019 Properties have been expropriated (see Cl. PHB, para. 129 and note 420; Resp. Skel., para. 10.2.3). The Claimants also note that Ms. Tsvakwi and Minister Mutasa accepted during the Hearing that no compensation was paid for the expropriation of the Zimbabwean Properties and, further, that Ms. Tsvakwi accepted that the Constitutional Amendment prohibited the Claimants from challenging the expropriations in the courts (such that there was a lack of due process) (see Cl. PHB, para. 130; Tr. Day 4, p. 1207 - Tsvakwi; Tr. Day 5, p. 1403 - Mutasa):\n\nCross-Examination of Ms. Tsvakwi (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1206-1207, 1244):\n\nQ. So, is essentially you\u2019re seeking to punish people who happened to acquire land which once upon a time was owned by colonizers.\n\nA. No, it\u2019s not to punish them. It\u2019s to correct the historical imbalance.\n\nQ. But it\u2019s a big punishment. I mean, if you just Imagine you\u2019ve worked hard for a long time, you\u2019ve complied with the laws and you\u2019ve bought an asset and someone comes in, your life\u2019s work and they take it for no compensation, that\u2019s a punishment, isn\u2019t it? it is inour book.\n\nA. Compensation is supposed to be paid.\n\nQ. But it wasn\u2019t paid.\n\nA. That was because of the shortage of resources, but it will be paid for both land and improvements.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ..... Do you accept as a general policy statement\u2014you have stated that you respect due process. And that\u2014my understanding was you\u2019re referring to the right to challenge expropriations in the courts.\n\nA. Yeah. During that time is was too cumbersome because whatever the Government tried to acquire we would find ourselves in the courts because the acquisition process was being challenged at that time.\n\nQ. So the\u2014sorry. So the purpose of the Constitutional Amendment was to take away that due process so It was less cumbersome? That was one of the purposes?\n\nA. The purpose was not to challenge the acquisition itself but only compensation.\n\nQ. Okay. Again, that was because you could\u2014yes, you could no longer go to court?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nCross-Examination of Minister Mutasa (see Tr. Day 5, pp. 1403, 1384):\n\nQ. And do you accept that compensation has not been paid to the von Pezolds with regard to the expropriation of their land?\n\nA. They don\u2019t need it. I would\u2014I would protest very violently that these people are being paid unfairly. They have lost absolutely nothing. They did not bring anything with them from Germany that should be compensated.\n\nQ. And do we agree that up until the Constitutional Amendment of 2005, you agreed to provide due process in regards to expropriation?\n\nA. Well, with the difference that we stated publicly that Land Reform problems should not be referred to courts. They should be settled by the Ministry of Lands, and that understanding still exists.\n\nQ. Okay. And, again, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re familiar with the laws. Okay. So you\u2019re saying that the issue is being taken to the Ministry of Lands as opposed to the courts. So the Courts\u2019 jurisdiction in this regard no longer applies?\n\nA. It doesn\u2019t apply at all.\n\nQ. But only from 14 September 2005 onwards?\n\nA. Uh-huh.\n\n474.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, on either treaty standard, the lack of either compensation or due process means that the expropriations were unlawful.\n\n475.\n\nNonetheless, much of the Parties\u2019 argument and evidence has been focused on the other two criteria set out in the expropriation standards, namely public purpose and non-discrimination. The Claimants note that although public purpose is one of the elements of a lawful expropriation, it does not excuse the expropriating State from its obligation to pay compensation, as an expropriation for a public purpose is nevertheless an expropriation. The Claimants refer to the evidence elicited from both the Claimants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s witnesses during the Hearing in support of their view that the expropriations were not carried out for a public purpose. In particular, the Claimants refer to the following evidence (see Cl. PHB, paras. 132-137):\n\n\u2022 Professor Chan\u2019s evidence that the immediate cause of the Invasions was the Government\u2019s defeat in the February 2000 constitutional referendum. The Government attributed the loss to the white vote. The referendum included proposals for land nationalization and was opposed by the MDC, who were perceived to be supported by whites; in response the Government quickly took control of and propelled the land invasions of predominantly white-owned farms, which commenced three days thereafter, fearing that if it did not it would lose the June 2000 parliamentary elections (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 937-938, 954-956; Chan I, paras. 21-23 and 43, C-37);\n\n\u2022 Professor Chan\u2019s evidence that freedom fighters in the field informed him in 1980 that they primarily fought for political freedom, not land reform (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 943-944);\n\n\u2022 Professor Chan\u2019s evidence as to the damage suffered by Zimbabwe because of the LRP in terms of hyperinflation, loss of agricultural productivity, dislocation of society, destruction of the middle class and loss of agricultural markets to surrounding countries (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 962-964; Chan I, paras. 64-65, C-37; Chan II, para. 52, C-680);\n\n\u2022 John Robertson\u2019s written evidence (see Robertson I, paras. 12 and 16-27, C-36);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s acceptance that the LRP has caused suffering (although she attributes suffering at least in part to the lack of credit lines from the IMF and World Bank due to sanctions) (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1230, 1235, and 1236);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s acceptance that the police, the army and ZANU-PF, through the membership of provincial land identification committees, participated in the allocation of land that had been expropriated, which the Claimants say is a clear indication that the distribution of land was not done by non-partisan means. Ms. Tsvakwi accepted that the provincial land committees \"should have been composed of people who were completely independent\" (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1222);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s admission that the letter from the Chief Lands Officer of Mashona Land Central to the Governor and Resident Minister and the Provincial Lands Committee Chairman, Mashona Land Central, dated 13 September 2012 was evidence that Government officials were using the LRP for political purposes (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1228; C-766);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s testimony in response to an excerpt from the letter, excerpted at the beginning of the quote below (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1228-1229):\n\nQ. Progress on bankable 99-year leases has reached landmark deals with the banking community. Draft document has been forwarded to the Justice and Legal Minister, who shall present it to the Cabinet for approval. A1 permits have also been designed and shall be operationalized soon, intime for preparation for election campaign.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a clear Indication, as your\u2014someone at least, these two Government officials\u2014are using the Land Reform Programme to curry favour with the electorate?\n\nA. Yes, I\u2019ve seen the document.\n\nQ. Do you agree with that statement in6?\n\nA. I do.\n\nQ. You do. Okay.\n\nA. But I wanted to add that the fact that the document was going to be submitted to Cabinet, Cabinet was composed of all the Parties\u2014the MDC and the ZANU-PF\u2014so they were going to consider the document.\n\nQ. Okay. Can you tell me which Party those two gentlemen are from who wrote the letter?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know the parties. It is just an official. I don\u2019t know which Party he belongs to.\n\nQ. What about the resident Minister? He would be\u2014was he ZANU-PF?\n\nA. That man is ZANU-PF.\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s evidence that the Government\u2019s mandate came from the \"spontaneous mobs\" (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1250); and\n\n\u2022 The political beneficiary table prepared by the Claimants identifying expropriated properties allocated to senior government officials (see C-519), the Claimants\u2019 position being that the fact that such people received expropriated property contradicts the stated aims of the LRP (which was in the Respondent\u2019s evidence) to give land \"to landless indigenous people who were crowded in the arid communal areas\" (see Tsvakwi I, para. 36, R-1; see also Cl. PHB, para. 136).\n\n476.\n\nAs regards the criterion of non-discrimination, the Claimants refer to the following evidence given by Ms. Tsvakwi and Minister Mutasa at the Hearing (see Cl. PHB, paras. 139-142):\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s evidence that once a farmer had his land expropriated the determination as to whether or not he could stay on the land was based purely on the fact that he was white and/or the size of the farm (on cross-examination, Ms. Tsvakwi confirmed that the determination was made on the basis of the racial identity of the farmer; on redirect examination, Ms. Tsvakwi stated that the criterion for expropriation was based on size; finally, during re-cross-examination, Ms. Tsvakwi testified that nearly all of the white-owned commercial farms fell within the size criterion and therefore qualified for expropriation by default) (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1204, 1249 and 1251);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi and Minister Mutasa\u2019s evidence that the effect of the Constitutional Amendment was to reduce the number of white farmers from 4,500 to approximately 300 (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1183-1185 - Tsvakwi; Tr. Day 5, pp. 1372-1373 - Mutasa);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi and Minister Mutasa\u2019s evidence that the Claimants\u2019 investments were expropriated because the Claimants are white and in their opinion are \"in the mould of white colonizers\", \"colonialists\" and \"Rhodesians\" (see Tr. Day4, pp. 1204-1205-Tsvakwi; Tr. Day 5, pp. 1350-1352, 1373 and 1374 - Mutasa);\n\n\u2022 Minister Mutasa\u2019s evidence that the von Pezolds should never have held land in Zimbabwe because they are not Zimbabweans (see Tr. Day 5, pp. 1390-1391); and\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s evidence as to the policy toward black farmers (in contrast to that toward white farmers) which was not to expropriate their farms, although a small number of black-owned farms were expropriated in breach of this policy; and Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s confirmation that, under the new Constitution, black Zimbabweans were to be compensated for land and improvements, whereas white Zimbabweans were only to be compensated for improvements (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1190 and 1248; Tr. Day 4, pp. 1190-1192; see also Utete Report, p. 35, s. 1(c), C-221 and Tr. Day 3, p. 657 -Theron; 2013 Constitution, s. 16.8(1) and 16.8(3), CLEX-331).\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to the Respondent\u2019s opening submissions during the Hearing, in which counsel for the Respondent stated that, given that whites took the land prior to independence, it was the whites whose land had to be expropriated and that if it had been the Japanese who had taken the land then it would have been the Japanese whose land was expropriated (see Tr. Day 2, pp. 386-387; see also Resp. Skel., para. 177). The Claimants\u2019 position is that such statements only serve to highlight the arbitrary and discriminatory nature of the Respondent\u2019s conduct (see Cl. PHB, para. 141).\n\n478.\n\nAs regards Section 23(3)(g) of the Constitution, which deals with affirmative action, the Claimants note that this provision was enacted in order that the Zimbabwean courts could not rule that the 2005 Constitutional Amendment was discriminatory. The Claimants aver, however, that a domestic law provision does not prevent this Tribunal from holding that a measure is discriminatory and that, in any event, that provision was not retrospective, as confirmed by Mr. Machaya (see Cl. PHB, para. 142; Tr. Day 5, pp. 1473-75; Constitution Amendment, s. 23(3)(g), CLEX 19).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position regarding the Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim was initially set out as follows (see CM. para. 125-126):\n\nThe Claimants submit that the expropriation of their properties were inviolation of Article 4(2) of the German BIT and Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT. The Respondent concedes that the compulsory acquisition done interms of the Land Acquisition Act and its Constitution is tantamount to expropriation. Respondent contends however that the measures it took were lawful and did not violate any of the BITs and Protocols. As regards the monetary and fiscal regulatory measures taken by the Respondent which are alleged to have expropriated their sales proceeds and profits, Respondent contends that as any other State it is entitled to regulate its monetary affairs, and Investors in the country are obliged to comply with such regulatory measures.\n\nThe exercise of such discretion by the Respondent was not so unreasonable given the economic realities of the Republic at the relevant time. The discretion has to be viewed in the context of the country\u2019s prevailing circumstances and as such International law should not Intervene, [citations omitted]\n\n480.\n\nThe Respondent argued that none of the Residual Properties had been expropriated, reasoning that the Respondent had not done anything to interfere with the use and enjoyment of such property, and that, while the Zimbabwean Properties had been expropriated, the Claimants continued to use and control them, even reaping handsome profits (see CM, paras. 128 and 144). in the Rejoinder, the Respondent argued that, as a matter of public international law, none of the Claimants\u2019 Properties had been expropriated because the Claimants still controlled them (see Rejoinder, paras. 1055-1060). In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent reverted to the more nuanced argument that there has been no wrongful taking, as the Claimants received full compensation beginning promptly upon \"enactment of the Constitutional Amendment in the form of eight years of substantially unemcumbered use of the Forrester Estate, the Border Estate and the Makandi Estate during which time the Claimants continued to export product at their own independently set intercompany transfer prices\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 231). The Respondent submits that the means (i.e., amount) of compensation is proportional \"under broad Public Order circumstances\" (see *ibid.* *,* fn. 827).\n\n481.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the expropriations were carried out for an overriding \"public purpose\", and for this reason were lawful (see CM. paras. 131-132):\n\nPublic purpose is considered by international law to be of such overriding importance that it is allowed to derogate from the principle of respect of private rights. The public need must be genuine and governed by the principle of good faith. The Claimants aver that the land reform in Zimbabwe was not for a public purpose as it benefitted the elite.\n\nRespondent however contends that the expropriation was for a public purpose which overrides the interests of the individuals. As already stated in the historical background, there was a public need for land which had to be addressed. Compulsory acquisition of land by the Respondent was in the interest of the general public and more particularly the indigenous people who were disadvantaged due to the colonial system of government regarding land tenure.\n\n482.\n\nAs regards the FTLRP, the Respondent avers that its goal was simply to maintain public order (see Resp. PHB, para. 255):\n\nOnce the uprisings \u2018happened\u2019, this Government like any Government had to react, to govern, to decide. Faced with the fact that the uprisings \u2018happened\u2019, understanding the pent-up pressure of history, it made the right decision not to turn on its people, not to risk a massacre, but to the best of their understanding of their own people to maintain the public order, and to follow the mandate of the masses marching with sticks and stones: war veterans\u2019 and the land hungry masses\u2019 hostility to the Government\u2019s slow pace of land reform forced the Government to embark on Fast Track Land Reform.\"\n\n483.\n\nThe Respondent also avers that elites having land does not negate public purpose. The Respondent likens President Mugabe to Nelson Mandela, freedom fighter turned politician, in support of its explanation as to why officials have been granted land (see Resp. PHB, paras. 267-269):\n\nGiven the overwhelming Public Interest, elite, having land, which is normal in any society, does not negate Public Purpose. One of the worst legacies of machine gun proclaimed \"white superiority\" was to crush African Zimbabweans\u2019 self confidence. Certain men rose above this handicap, men such as Nelson Mandela about whom it was said at the time of his funeral that Mr. Mandela never seemed to doubt that he was the equal of any man. The same can be said of Mugabe: Protester. Prisoner. Teacher. Peacemaker. President who advanced the education and healthcare of his people and who has strived to reduce inequalities and of Mutasa, each men of character, who do not purport to be submissive.\n\nAt the Nelson Mandela Memorial CNN aired on December 10, 2013, Christiane Amanpour commented that although the West may see them as dictators and that sometimes it is difficult for people in the west to get it, the fact is the huge crowd at Nelson Mandela\u2019s Memorial service gave an extraordinary applause for Robert Mugabe, a great liberation leader: one of the original to cast off the mantle of white oppression. People here don\u2019t forget that.\n\nSenior officials holding land is not \"corruption\". Many of those officials risked their lives to liberate their country from the yoke of the foreign oppressor. \"Zimbabwe Takes back its Land\" concludes \"Many Zimbabweans think fairness requires preference for war veterans and that occupiers should receive priority.\": Minister Mutasa confirmed during his oral testimony: \"Ifthey are part of the Fighters, the people who actually went out to fight the illegal system of Ian Smith, well, they are entitled. That is part of what is their payment.\n\n484.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the LRP is discriminatory (see Resp. PHB, para. 233):\n\nThere is no discrimination in Respondent\u2019s Land Reform Program. Respondent is not responsible for historic allocation of large-scale estates into few hands. Respondent did not pick any race by which to be exploited and it did not pick any race from which to re-distribute land but from the holders of the land. Prof. Chan agrees the historic holders were white. Has they been of a neighbouring black African State or Japanese, land had to be taken from those who had it, a clear non-discriminatory criterion. As Mrs. Tsvakwi testifies, large-scale farms owned by blacks were taken for re-distribution as well, [citations omitted]\n\n485.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent set out concisely the historical context underpinning the LRP, which forms the basis for its position that the taking of the Claimants\u2019 property was non-discriminatory (see CM, paras. 140-143):\n\n... Land was at the heart of the problems in the Republic from Lobengula\u2019s time. It was one of the major reasons for waging war against the colonial powers and those who sought to perpetuate the colonial legacy. Land had to be taken from those who had (predominantly white) and restored to those who were historically disadvantaged (predominantly black). The issue of whether there was discrimination in the treatment of whites over the land question cannot be addressed without reference to the history of land ownership in the Republic. The First Chimurenga (uprising) in 1893 to 1896 was fought to restore land seized from blacks in 1890. The War of Liberation (Second Chimurenga) which ended with the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979 was over land and the Agreement nearly collapsed on account of the land question.\n\nIt is important to point out that the Colonial Government put in place policies that favoured the white commercial farmers. They could get training, direct grants, loan guarantees schemes, funding for agricultural research and funds for building roads. As a result of the government policy many whites bought farm lands. The areas reserved for white tended to be upland areas where rain fall was higher and the soil fertile.\n\nThe Land Policy then resulted in whites who constituted less than 1% of the population owning more than 70% of the arable land including most of the best land. As regards the blacks, very few could afford to buy small plots in Native Purchase Areas reserved for them by the Colonial Government. They had no access to finance and financial institutions.\n\nThe taking therefore was not discriminatory. It followed the realities of land ownership vis-\u00e0-vis the exercise for the redistribution of that same land.\n\n486.\n\nAs regards due process, the Respondent submits that prior to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment, it was open to the Claimants to apply to the municipal courts for review in connection with the taking of their property, referring to *Mike Campbell (Private) Limited and Anors v. Min. of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement and Anor,* which established that anyone affected by an acquisition could approach the court for review. The Respondent also relies on *James,* where the ECHR held that a decision not to grant judicial review where landlords were deprived of their property interest in the public interest was lawful. Thus, even once the 2005 Constitutional Amendment was enacted, which precluded farmers from challenging the expropriation of their farms before the courts, the Respondent contends that due process was not violated (see CM, paras. 146-148):\n\n... The Constitutional Amendment number 17 was a response to the difficulties caused by the acquisition of farms (including those protected by bilateral agreements) on an individual basis through the courts. Litigation delayed the acquisition. The exercise was expensive and the pressure from the landless society agitating for resettlement was immense. The Amendment Number 17 was clearly not a violation of due process. Further the claimants had reasonable advance notice that their properties were going to be expropriated. This was through the Section 5 Notices in terms of the Land Acquisition Act.\n\nFurthermore the Government of Zimbabwe introduced Section 16B in its Constitution to acquire rural land that had been previously identified under Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 16B put an end to litigation over rural land compulsorily acquired for resettlement which land had been identified under Section 5 for acquisition through the Land Acquisition Act. It is important to point out that litigation over the acquisition of land was put to an end only in respect of rural agricultural land that had been acquired by Government.\n\nAs regards compensation for improvements a person whose farm has been acquired and is not satisfied with the amount of compensation can approach the court for the determination of an appropriate amount.\n\n487.\n\nThus, in its Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent stated that \"exceptional circumstances of maintaining Public Order\" justified \"constrained due process\", noting that the acquisition process was expensive and pressure from the landless society agitating for resettlement was immense (see Resp. PHB, para. 232).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached the expropriation provisions of the German and Swiss BITs68.\n\nIt is recalled that R\u00fcdiger claims only under the German BIT, apart from Invoking Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT by virtue of the German BIT MFN clause. It is further recalled that the Border Claimants claim only under the Swiss BIT.\n\n489.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the German BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\nProtection and Safeguards\n\n\u2026\n\n(2) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalised or subjected to any other measure the effect of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalisation in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose and against prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or impending expropriation, nationalisation or other comparable measure becomes publicly known. Such compensation shall be paid without delay, shall carry the usual commercial interest until the date of payment and shall be effectively realisable and freely transferable. Provision shall have been made in an appropriate manner at or prior to the time of expropriation, nationalisation, or other comparable measure of the determination and payment of such compensation. The legality of any such expropriation, nationalisation or other comparable measure and the amount of such compensation shall be subject to review by due process of law.\n\n\u2026\n\n490.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the Swiss BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 6\n\nExpropriation\n\n(1) Investments of Investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the Internal needs of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the real value of the Investment expropriated Immediately before the expropriation or before the Impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall Include Interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realisable and be freely transferable. The investor affected shall have the right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other Independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its Investment inaccordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.\n\n(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is Incorporated or constituted under the law inforce in any part of its territory, and in which Investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall, to the extent necessary and subject to its laws, ensure that compensation according to paragraph (1) of this Article will be made available to such Investors.\n\n491.\n\nThus, the criteria for a lawful expropriation under the BITs are:\n\n\u2022 Public purpose;\n\n\u2022 Prompt, adequate and effective compensation paid without delay;\n\n\u2022 Non-discriminatory basis (Swiss BIT only); and\n\n\u2022 Due process\n\n492.\n\nThere is therefore, in practice, relatively little difference between the criteria under Art 4(2) of the German BIT and Art 6(1) of the Swiss BIT. Accordingly, where the Tribunal finds below an unlawful expropriation under the Swiss BIT, it also finds an unlawful expropriation under the German BIT. Although there could foreseeably arise a case in which an expropriation was lawful under the German BIT yet unlawful under the Swiss BIT (because, although satisfying the criteria under Art 4(2) of the German BIT, it was carried out on a discriminatory basis in breach of Art 6(1) of the Swiss BIT), those very specific circumstances do not arise here. It is therefore not necessary to consider R\u00fcdiger\u2019s claim to be entitled also to rely on Art 6(1) of the Swiss BIT by virtue of the MFN clauses contained in the German BIT.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal considers these criteria in connection with each major asset group in turn below.\n\na) Zimbabwean Properties\n------------------------\n\n494.\n\nWhile the Respondent has vacillated on its position as to whether the Zimbabwean Properties (see above, para. 157) were expropriated, it has not seriously contested as a matter of fact that these properties were expropriated. The fact that the Claimants remain in control or possession of parts of the Zimbabwean Properties does not mean that they have not been expropriated. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 contention that the transfer of legal title is sufficient here to establish expropriation.\n\n495.\n\nTo recall, the properties that allegedly have been directly expropriated as a result of the Constitutional Amendment are all ten of the Forrester Properties, 21 of the 28 Border Properties (two of which contain a sawmill), and six of the nine Makandi Properties, collectively referred to herein as the Zimbabwean Properties (see above, para. 157), along with the Water Permits attaching to the Makandi and Forrester Properties (see above, paras. 147 and 153). As noted above, although legal title has been transferred, the Claimants remain in possession and control of large sections of the properties (according to the Claimants, one third of the Forrester Estate is occupied by Settlers/War Veterans, 16% of Border Estate is occupied by Settlers/War Veterans, and 29% of the Makandi Estate is occupied by Settlers/War Veterans.\n\n496.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the expropriations were lawful or that there was no real expropriation because the Claimants remain on the land. In relation to deciding whether the expropriation was lawful under the BITs, the Tribunal notes that all of the conditions set out in the relevant BITs must be met. As set out above, this would require payment of compensation, that the taking be for a public purpose, and that there be access to due process. In the case of the Swiss BIT, the taking must also be conducted on a non-discriminatory basis.\n\n497.\n\nIt is clear that no compensation has been paid for the properties and therefore that the expropriation did not fulfil the \"lawful\" criteria. The Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that continued use of the properties constitutes compensation for the expropriation. Any income that may have been gathered after 14 September 2005 would not equate to prompt adequate and effective compensation without delay. Any continued income would instead be a factor in assessing damages and loss.\n\n498.\n\nAs no compensation was paid, there is no need to decide whether the acquisition was for a public purpose, whether there was access to due process or, in the case of the Swiss BIT, whether the acquisition was non-discriminatory.\n\n499.\n\nHowever, as the Parties have pleaded extensively on these matters, the Tribunal addresses them briefly here. The 2005 Constitutional Amendment not only transferred legal title to the above-mentioned properties from the Claimants to the Government of Zimbabwe, it expressly denied the Claimants access to due process by removing the ability of landowners to challenge the acquisition of their land, as they had been entitled to do prior to the Amendment under the *Land Acquisition Act.* Ms. Tsvakwi acknowledged this during the Hearing (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1244, lines 2-21).\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the application of ECHR jurisprudence to the present case to justify the extinction of the right of challenge that previously existed for landowners under the Land Acquisition Act. The Tribunal notes that the Amendment also criminalized the continued possession or occupation of agricultural land expropriated pursuant to the Amendment. These steps did not constitute a \"constraint\" on due process, but rather its total elimination.\n\n501.\n\nAs regards to the criterion of non-discrimination in the Swiss BIT's expropriation provision, the evidence supports a conclusion that the Claimants were targeted as a result of their skin colour and, hence, the taking was discriminatory in breach of the Swiss BIT. The Tribunal notes, for example, Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s evidence as to the policy toward black farmers (in contrast to that toward white farmers) which was not to expropriate their farms, although a small number of black-owned farms were expropriated in breach of this policy, as well as Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s confirmation that under the new Constitution, black Zimbabweans were to be compensated for land and improvements, whereas white Zimbabweans were only to be compensated for improvements (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1191, lines 5-20)69. The Tribunal also accepts the evidence of Mr. Machaya that s 23(3)(g) of the new Consitution was not enacted with retrospective effect, to the extent such a provision could have justified or shielded an otherwise discriminatory provision in the Constitution (a matter on which this Tribunal need not opine).\n\nSee the Tribunal\u2019s further discussion of racial discrimination in the context of the Repondent\u2019s necessity defence at Section Vl.l(7), especially paras. 648-657.\n\n502.\n\nFinally, the Respondent has failed to establish that there was a legitimate public purpose behind the expropriation. The Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent\u2019s arguments relating, in effect, to the righting of historical wrongs. The Tribunal cannot, however, accept these arguments as support for the expropriation of the Zimbabwean Properties having been carried out for a \"public purpose\". Once taken, large parts of the properties have not actually been re-distributed to a historically disadvantaged or otherwise landless population, but remain in the *de facto* possession of the Claimants. With regard to the land that has been re-distributed, there appears to be a clear trend towards politically-motivated allocations of land. Therefore, there is no evidence that the expropriation of the Zimbabwean Properties was in the public interest or served a genuine public purpose.\n\n503.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Zimbabwean Properties (including the Makandi and Forrester Water Permits and the Tilbury and Charter Sawmills) were unlawfully expropriated by the Respondent as of 14 September 2005, on which date the 2005 Constitutional Amendment vested title in the Zimbabwean Properties in the State.\n\nb) Residual Properties\n----------------------\n\n504.\n\nThe Claimants have shown that the Residual Properties not directly expropriated (seven Border Properties, two further properties on the Border Estate and three Makandi Properties, see above, para. 158) are essentially rendered worthless without the Zimbabwean Properties, as they are not economically viable as individual operations (i.e., without the use of economies of scale provided by the larger venture). This amounts to an indirect expropriation and therefore the Government has also breached the BITs in relation to the Residual Properties. The Tribunal includes here also the Makandi Acquisition Rights.\n\n505.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Residual Properties were also unlawfully expropriated by the Respondent as of 14 September 2005, on which date the 2005 Constitutional Amendment vested title in the Zimbabwean Properties in the State.\n\nc) Income-Generating Assets on the Claimants\u2019 Properties and the Zimbabwean Company Shares\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nThe Income-Generating Assets on the Claimants\u2019 Properties include Border\u2019s two factories, the pole treatment plant and the Sheba sawmill.\n\n507.\n\nThe Claimants have shown that the Residual Properties cannot sustain these assets and therefore they are effectively valueless or, at least, their value has been reduced to such an extent that they should be considered indirectly expropriated.\n\n508.\n\nTo this end, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission at para. 851 of the Memorial:\n\n...[T]he remaining seven properties, which between them cover an area of 6,430 ha, the two factories, the pole treatment plant, and the remaining sawmill... are not viable on their own and therefore they become worthless to the Claimants. The reasons for this are as follows. First, the remaining seven properties do not have enough plantable area to sustain an integrated forestry operation. Second, there are insufficient numbers of saw logs available from third parties. Third, and in any event, the revenue generated from such an operation would not cover the costs of the operation.\n\n509.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submissions that, upon the expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 Properties, the Claimants\u2019 shares in the Zimbabwean Companies which held title to the Claimants\u2019 Properties were rendered worthless such that they must be considered to have been indirectly expropriated.\n\n510.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal also finds that the Income-Generating Assets on the Claimants\u2019 Properties and the Zimbabwean Company Shares were unlawfully expropriated in breach of the BITs as of 14 September 2005, on which date the 2005 Constitutional Amendment vested title in the Zimbabwean Properties in the State.\n\nd) Forrester Water Rights\n-------------------------\n\n511.\n\nThe original Water Rights for the Forrester Estate were granted under the *Water Act 1976.* In 2000 these were replaced without compensation by Water Permits pursuant to the *Water Act 1998.* The main differences between a Water Right and a Water Permit are: (i) duration (inperpetuity versus 20 years); (ii) the possibility of a levy for consumption under the Water Permits (a levy was charged to the von Pezold Claimants from 2009); and (iii) there is no explicit provision for compensation if rights under a Water Permit are amended. The Claimants have submitted both indirect and direct expropriation claims in respect of the loss of these Forrester Water Rights.\n\n512.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants\u2019 indirect expropriation claim is based on the premise that their rights under the Permits were \"so different, and much-diminished\" when compared with their rights under the previous system that their original Water Rights were effectively lost. While the changes to duration, levying process and compensation rights under the new Water Permits regime were significant, the Tribunal is not persuaded that they are sufficient to amount to an indirect expropriation of the Forrester Water Rights. This is particularly so given that, after 2000, the von Pezold Claimants remained able to use the surface water at the Forrester Estate as they had previously done under the Water Rights regime, and that no substantive levy was charged until well after all of the Forrester Properties themselves were expropriated in 2005. Accordingly, no indirect expropriation of the Forrester Water Rights In 2000 has been established. The loss suffered by the Claimants in this respect is more appropriately dealt with in the context of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 FET claims below.\n\n513.\n\nIn terms of direct expropriation, the Forrester Water Rights (later the Water Permits) attached to the land, and were therefore, as the Tribunal has already found above, expropriated in 2005 along with all of the Forrester Properties. However, the value of the Forrester Water Permits is inextricably tied to, and accounted for as part of, the value of the Forrester land. The Tribunal is therefore not inclined to find any additional direct expropriation for the Forrester Water Permits beyond the general expropriation of the Forrester Properties in 2005, and therefore dismisses this claim.\n\n514.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants also assert a loss of value of the Forrester Shares as a result of the conversion of the Forrester Water Rights to Water Permits (see Reply, para. 545). As with the discussion of direct expropriation above, however, the Tribunal does not consider that this loss is sufficiently distinct from the loss caused by the general expropriation of the Forrester Properties to constitute a separate head of damage, and therefore dismisses this claim.\n\ne) Forrester Loans\n------------------\n\n515.\n\nThe Forrester Loans were made by Elisabeth to the Forrester Estate between 1994 and 1998. Twelve of the Forrester Loans remain outstanding. As with the Forrester Water Rights claim addressed above, the von Pezold Claimants have submitted both direct and indirect expropriation claims in respect of the Forrester Loans.\n\n516.\n\nThe indirect expropriation claim relates to the Government\u2019s refusal to release foreign currency to enable the repayment of the Forrester Loans in December 2001. It is unclear from the pleadings and the evidence, however, whether the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 inability to obtain the foreign currency would have become a permanent state of affairs, or whether foreign currency might have become available at a later date in order to allow repayment. The Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the Respondent\u2019s actions in December 2001 constituted an indirect expropriation -i.e., a permanent deprivation - of the value of the Forrester Loans. As with the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 claim for direct expropriation of the Forrester Water Rights considered above, the Tribunal considers that this issue is more appropriately dealt with in the context of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 FET claims below.\n\n517.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants\u2019 second submission is that the Forrester Loans were directly expropriated on 14 September 2005, when the Respondent expropriated the assets of the Forrester Estate - thereby also preventing the Forrester Loans from ever being repaid. However, the evidence shows that the Forrester Estate continued to produce income for the von Pezold Claimants and their companies (Forrester has been described as a \"thriving business\"). Thus this income (putting to one side the Respondent\u2019s refusal to release foreign currency, to be considered in more detail in the context of FET below) could well have been used to repay the outstanding balance of the loans. As a result, the Tribunal does not consider that the Forrester Loans were directly expropriated, and therefore dismisses this claim.\n\nf) Border Forex Losses and Other Foreign Exchange Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there has been a direct expropriation in relation to monies directly debited from the Claimants\u2019 accounts by the Respondent - namely, when the Respondent took US Dollars directly from the Claimants\u2019 accounts (the **\"Border Forex Losses\").** That direct expropriation occurred on 5 September 2008, when the Respondent began debiting US Dollars from Border and Border International\u2019s bank accounts, and continued until 19 September 2008 (see Cl. Skeleton, para. 124; Heinrich I, para. 845).\n\n519.\n\nWith regard to loss of value resulting from the Respondent\u2019s other foreign exchange measures applicable to the conversion of US Dollars to Zimbabwe Dollars (namely, the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall, the Forrester Conversion Amount and the Border Liquidation Shortfall), however, the Tribunal considers that while an FET breach has been made out (see discussion below), expropriation has not. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses all other aspects of the Claimants\u2019 foreign exchange measures expropriation claim.\n\ng) Seized Maize\n---------------\n\n520.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that 4,500 tonnes of maize was directly expropriated by the Respondent when the state-controlled Grain Marketing Board seized maize from the Forrester Estate on 19 January 2002. The Respondent does not deny that the Grain Marketing Board seized the maize; rather, it disputes the Claimants\u2019 contention that the maize should have been paid for at the market price rather than at the Respondent\u2019s fixed grain prices (see CM, para. 155). The Tribunal is satisfied that the 4,500 tonnes of maize were directly expropriated by the Respondent without due process. Whether the Claimants suffered loss as a result of receiving an inadequate price in return from the Grain Marketing Board is more properly considered in the *quantum* section below.\n\nh) Conclusion\n-------------\n\n521.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have established unlawful expropriation by the Respondent in breach of Article 4(2) of the German BIT and Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT, in connection with: (a) the Zimbabwean Properties; (b) the Residual Properties; (c) the Income-Generating Assets on the Claimants\u2019 Properties and the Zimbabwean Companies Shares; (d) the Border Forex Losses; and (e) the Seized Maize. The quantification of damages for these breaches will be considered below.\n\n(2) Fair and Equitable Treatment\n--------------------------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n522.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached the FET standard contained in Article 2(1) of the German BIT and Article 4(1) of the Swiss BIT. The Claimants submit that the FET standard contained in the BITs is not referrable to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. However, to the extent that it does incorporate the minimum standard, the Claimants submit that the minimum standard has evolved since the *Neer* case and that outrage, bad faith and wilful neglect of duty are no longer required to establish a breach of the customary international law minimum standard (see Cl. Skel., para. 133).\n\n523.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the purpose of the FET standard is to insulate investors from political risk and to protect their \"legitimate expectations\" (i.e., expectations arising from the investor\u2019s reliance on the State\u2019s representations, promises and commitments and all other circumstances where the State is found to have breached the FET standard) (see Cl. Skel., para. 131). The Claimants note that the FET standard in the BITs may be breached whether or not specific representations or assurances have been made by the State. Finally, the Claimants contend that the following are all elements of the FET standard (see *ibid.* *,* para. 135, relying on *Tecmed,* paras. 153-154, CLEX-202; *Waste Management,* para. 98, CLEX-208; and *Saluka,* paras. 302-303 and 307-308, CLEX-217; see also Cl. PHB, para. 146, relying also on *Kardassopoulos,* paras. 71, 419, 434 to 441; CLEX-248):\n\nThe State\u2019s conduct must not affect the basic expectations that the investor formed when making the investment, including those that arise from representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the investor. The State\u2019s conduct must not be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, Idiosyncratic, discriminatory, expose the investor to sectional or racial prejudice, coerce or harass the Investor, or lack due process. States must be consistent, even handed, unambiguous, transparent, candid, act ingood faith and with procedural propriety. Compensation must be paid upon expropriation. The State\u2019s policies must be implemented bona fide through conduct reasonably justifiable by public policies, i.e. the State\u2019s measures must be proportional. Different treatment must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies. States must ensure a stable business environment. Breach is not dependent on bad faith or intention.\n\n524.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the FET standard in the BITs was breached in connection with the following (see Cl. Skel., paras. 137-140):\n\n\u2022 The Forrester Water Rights, for failure to compensate the von Pezold Claimants upon their conversion to Water Permits In 2000;\n\n\u2022 The Zimbabwean Properties, Residual Properties and the Zimbabwean Company Shares, for failure to compensate the Claimants for the expropriation of their investments, as well as for the arbitrary, discriminatory and violent manner in which the aggressive phases of the LRP were applied to the Claimants and their investments. The Claimants also submit that the LRP did not bear a reasonable relationship to rational policies, the LRP lacked transparency and candour, and the 2005 Constitutional Amendment denied the Claimants due process in preventing court challenges of the expropriation. Finally, the Claimants submit that the Respondent breached the undertakings made to the Claimants, and on which they relied, when they made their investments;\n\n\u2022 The Forrester Loans, for the arbitrary refusal to release foreign currency for the repayment of the Loans. The Claimants also note that the expropriation of the Estates, and therefore the expropriation of the Forrester Loans, was without compensation; and\n\n\u2022 The foreign exchange policy, for the grossly unfair, idiosyncratic, arbitrary and bad faith manner in which the Respondent set and used the Official Rates of Exchange. The Claimants add that none of the expropriations that occurred through the foreign exchange policy (the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall, the Forrester Conversion Amount and the Border Liquidation Shortfall) have been compensated.\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimants state that they had basic and legitimate expectations at the time they made their investments that the Respondent would treat them and their investments in a just, consistent, transparent, even-handed, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory manner, \"follow due process and act in good faith proportionately without coercion or harassment and pay compensation upon expropriation\" (see Cl. PHB, para. 146). The Claimants assert that President Mugabe recognized these norms when he made speeches at the time the Republic of Zimbabwe gained its independance, which caused the von Pezolds to invest in Zimbabwe over other African States \"that were less progressive\" (see *ibid* *.,* citing Tr. Day 3, p. 669 - R\u00fcdiger; PM Elect R. Mugabe Address to the Nation, 4 March 1980, C-444; PM Elect R. Mugabe, Address on Independence Eve, 17 April 1980, CLEX-445).\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimants submit that these expectations are rooted in international norms (and in particular the concept of good faith) and are not dependent on a specific representation of the State (see Cl. PHB, para. 146 citing *Saluka,* para. 307, CLEX-217). The Claimants state that the Respondent is wrong when it asserts that they should have expected their investments to be \"indigenized\" (see RHEX-24, para. 3; Tr. Day 2, pp. 396-397). The Claimants note in any event that the issue of \"indigenization\" has not been pleaded and that Zimbabwean indigenization laws did not enter into force until April 2008 (see Cl. PHB, para. 147).\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimants submit that evidence elicited during the Hearing concerning the Respondent\u2019s placement of Settlers/War Veterans on their Properties, concerning disproportionality and arbitrary regulation, and concerning discrimination, the absence of a public purpose and lack of compensation and due process, establishes that the application of the aggressive phases of the LRP to the Zimbabwean Properties, Residual Properties, Income-Generating Assets and Zimbabwean Company Shares, and Forrester Water Rights, and the application of the Foreign Exchange Measures, were all contrary to the Claimants\u2019 basic and legitimate expectations at the time of Investing and therefore the Respondent breached the FET standards (see Cl. PHB, para. 148).\n\n528.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Claimants also submit that the Respondent has breached specific representations and assurances given to the Claimants inregard to their investments (see Cl. PHB, Sched. 1). The Claimants note that, inregard to the Respondents\u2019 assurances concerning the scope of the LRP, the following evidence was elicited during the Hearing (see Cl. PHB, para. 150):\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi accepted that the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme and Implementation Plan Phase 2 of the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement dated April 2001 was a government policy document concerning the LRP (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1170-1171; C-218;\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi also accepted that it was the Respondent\u2019s policy between 1980 and 12 March 2004 not to expropriate more than 8.3 million ha of the 15.5 million ha of large-scale commercial farm land (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1170-1172); that underutilized land was to be the focus of the LRP expropriations (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1173-1174); and that it was the Respondent\u2019s policy not to expropriate properties covered by the BITs or properties forming tea, coffee, timber and citrus plantations (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1174-1176);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Scofield testified that in June 2001 the Minister responsible for forestry assured Border that forestry plantations would be excluded from the LRP (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 723-724, 727 and 728; Tr. Day 3, p. 750; Scofield I, para. 31, C-27);\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi confirmed the Respondent\u2019s policy inregard to properties covered by BITs by way of a *Note Verbale* dated November 2000 to all diplomatic missions (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1176-1177; see also circular from Ministry of Foreign Affairs to all diplomatic missions and International organizations accredited to Zimbabwe dated 21 November 2000, C-227); and\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi did not dispute the Claimants\u2019 submission that the *Note Verbale* of 16 September 2005 was consistent with the Respondent\u2019s prior policy statements that BIT properties would not, and therefore had not, been expropriated by the Constitutional Amendment (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1182; *Note Verbale* dated 16 September 2005, p. 2, C-230).\n\n529.\n\ninregard to the Respondent\u2019s other alleged assurances, the Claimants refer to the following evidence elicited during the Hearing (see Cl. PHB, para. 152):\n\n\u2022 R\u00fcdiger confirmed the appreciation expressed by a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank and the Minister of Lands when the von Pezolds acquired the Forrester Estate in 1982 (see Tr. Day 5, p. 680; Tr. Day 3, pp. 700-701);\n\n\u2022 Minister Mutasa did not deny that a senior civil servant and the Ministry of Lands wrote to the von Pezolds in 1991 encouraging them to develop Forrester (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1364; see also letter from the Secretary of Lands dated 29 November 1991, C-496);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Machaya accepted that the Zimbabwean court orders of 2002 (see para. 547 below) were binding on the Respondent and are an acknowledgement that the German BIT applies to the Forrester and Border Estates (See Tr. Day 5, p. 1453-1460). Mr. Machaya testified as follows:\n\nQ:... you must surely accept that [the Order dated 16 September 2002 in Forrester *Estate (Private) Limited v Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement* (CLEX-378)] is a binding commitment, an acceptance by the Government of the Zimbabwe, that the German BIT applies to the Claimants\u2019 investments?\n\nA: At that stage - yes, I agree.\n\n[...]\n\nQ:... I assume that you consider [the High Court\u2019s Final Order dated 6 November 2002 in *Forrester Estate (Pvt) Ltd v* Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Settlement (CLEX-80)] to be a statement by the State of Zimbabwe acknowledging that the German BIT applies to the Forrester Estate?\n\nA: Yes, certainly. Domestically, we would simply say that our judiciary has made this pronouncement.\n\n[...]\n\nQ:... So, you would accept that what you said in relation to [CLEX-80], the same applies in relation to [the High Court\u2019s Final Order dated 6 November 2002 in *Border Timbers (Pvt) Ltd v Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement* (CLEX-81)] in that it\u2019s binding on the State?\n\nA: Yes. I would accept that it\u2019s a binding statement from our courts, although it is very clear that, in the last two cases, the executive were contesting that outcome [because the Orders were not made by consent],\n\n\u2022 Further, Mr. Machaya accepted that Section 16(9)(b) of the Constitution, enacted in 1996 and relied on by the Claimants, prevented the application of domestic law to foreign investors to the extent it derogated from the property and compensation rights granted to foreign investors under treaties. Mr. Machaya was unable to provide convincing authority for his argument that Section 16(9)(b) of the Constitution had been overridden by Section 16B of the 2005 Constitutional Amendment, which did not prohibit expropriation of land protected under International treaties. The Claimants say that the case cited by Mr. Machaya, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Nyahondo,* cannot be relied upon because reasons for the decision have never been published70. At the Hearing, Mr. Machaya could only speculate as to the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning, as follows (see Tr. Day 5, pp. 1463-1469; see also Tr. Day 5, pp. 1499-1501):\n\nQ... Now the issue arises as to whether, in fact, Section 16B, the Constitutional Amendment, overrides Section 16(9b). And I understand that this was an issue in Zimbabwe and that the general understanding was, up -at one point was that it did not, but then the Supreme Court ruled on that issue.\n\nIs that a fair summary of the matter?\n\nA: Where I have doubts is whether there was such a general understanding. There was certainly active discussion as to whether or not Section 16B overrode the provisions of Section 16(9). It was a very active debate, and it\u2014the debate is more fully spelled out in that case you have just referred to, Route Toute.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ. And since that decision [Nyahondo], the Supreme Court, although it hasn\u2019t given any reasoning, has confirmed, in effect, what everyone believes Nyahondo to have said, which is that properties covered by Bilateral Investment Treaties can be expropriated whether or not the terms and conditions of the Treaty have been followed?\n\nA. No. I don\u2019t think even the Order went that far, to say whether or not the terms have been\u2014have been followed.\n\nQ. So, is it still the law in Zimbabwe that properties which have been taken but the terms of the relevant Treaty have not been complied with, is that still illegal under Zimbabwean law?\n\nA. Well, I can only comment on what I believe\u2014\n\nQ. Yes, sure.\n\nA.\u2014this basis upon which the Supreme Court made its decision because what I argued for was that Section 16B overrode the provisions of Section 16(9).\n\nQ. Yes.\n\nA. And that I believe that the Order was based on an acceptance of that argument because of the way Section 16B is prefaced.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ. And that the people in Nyahondo and other subsequent Supreme Court cases were challenging the expropriation because the Treaty had not been complied with. So, they were saying, \"Look, these expropriations Notices and the Constitutional Amendment must be ineffective because we haven\u2019t been paid.\"\n\nBut the Court said, \"Well, doesn\u2019t matter that you haven\u2019t been paid. The effect of the Constitutional Amendment, Section 16B, is quite clear. Your properties can be taken and have been taken.\"\n\nA. Yes. Here I am merely stating an opinion. I believe that that is what the Court was saying, because in the absence of reason\u2014reasons for the judgment, I can\u2019t speak to it. But I believe that\u2019s what they were saying, in the belief that the\u2014the payment of compensation could only follow a valid acquisition.\n\n\u2022 Heinrich von Pezold\u2019s evidence that Minister Mahachi in 1999 stated that the von Pezolds\u2019 then-intended further investment into Border in 2000 was \"very positive\" and that he \"supported it\" (see Tr. Day 2, p. 583).\n\nThe Supreme Court issued an Order dated 6 November 2008 directing that the applicant\u2019s appeal be \"dismissed in its entirety\". The Order notes that \"detailed reasons for the judgment will be handed down in due course\", but these reasons were never released (see Mem. at paras. 832-836). In the High Court, the Honourable Mr. Justice Musakwa found that title had lawfully vested in the Respondent further to expropriation of the applicant\u2019s land under the Land Acquisition Act and by virtue of Section 16B of the Constitution. The applicant\u2019s title had been \"extinguished by law\" and therefore the former land owner had no standing to seek the eviction of settlers on the land. With respect to foreign investors\u2019 rights under international treaties, the Court held that the Constitution \"does not prohibit the compulsory acquisition of land that is subject to a bilateral investment protection agreement. Rather, the law provides that there be fair and prompt compensation to the affected party.\" *Nyahondo Farm (Private) Limited v. Brigadier General* A. *W. Tapfumaneyi & Ors, Case No. SC 176/08, High Court of Zimbabwe, Harare, 7 July 2008,* aff\u2019d on appeal to the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, Harare, 6 November 2008, CLEX-91 and CLEX-92. The *Nyahondo* judgments have therefore been relied upon as authority for the proposition that Section 16B(2)(b) of the 2005 Constitutional Amendment overrides Section 16(9)(b) of the 1996 Constitution. See e.g. the High Court\u2019s judgment in *Route Toute v Minister of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement:* \"I am bound by the contrary position recently adopted by the Supreme Court in *[Nyahondo]* to the effect that agricultural land covered by investment protection agreements under section 16(9b) is susceptible to acquisition in terms of section 16B\" (CLEX-93, p. 19).\n\n530.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the aforementioned assurances were bolstered by the Respondent in applying the German BIT provisionally from 8 September 1996 and by entry into force of the Swiss BIT on 9 February 2001, matters of which the Claimants were aware (see Heinrich I, para. 695-696, C-18; R\u00fcdiger I, para. 47, C 20; Scofield I, para. 29, C-27; Gadzikwa I, para. 16, C-30; see also Tr. Day 3, pp. 703-704, exchange between R\u00fcdiger and the Tribunal; and Tr. Day 2, p. 460, cross-examination of Elisabeth).\n\n531.\n\nThe Claimants note that the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* dictates that it is no defence for a State to assert that the investor had no legitimate expectation that the State would fulfil its promises even in circumstances of political risk, the very purpose of BITs being to encourage investment by insulating investors from political risk (see Cl. PHB, para. 153).\n\n532.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that Ad Article 3(a) of the German Protocol relied upon by the Respondent does not exclude \"[m]easures necessary for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality\" from the FET standard, but rather excludes such matters from the national treatment and MFN standards in Article 3, which are not relied upon by the Claimants. The Claimants also submit that it is very doubtful that the Calvo Doctrine has any application in public international law, but in any event it is not applicable to the Claimants vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent, as the BITs provide standards over and above the national treatment standard (see Surrejoinder, para. 412, referring to *CMS,* pp. 81 to 82).\n\n533.\n\nThe Claimants reason that, in any event, the Respondent\u2019s measures concerning the aggressive phases of the LRP and its foreign exchange were not taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality, but were taken in order to keep the government in power and to illegally spend foreign exchange (see Cl. PHB, para. 154).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimants\u2019 description of the FET standard, averring that it simply prohibits dealing in a discriminatory manner and, more generally, requires meeting the legitimate expectations of the investor (see Resp. PHB, paras. 242, 246). The Respondent relies on the ICSID cases of *LG&E* and *Kardassopoulos* in respect of content of the FET standard, emphasizing the *Kardassopoulos* tribunal\u2019s caution that \"the investor\u2019s fair expectations cannot fail to consider parameters such as business risk or industry\u2019s regular patterns\" (see Rejoinder, para. 618). The Respondent analogizes the redistribution of land at the heart of the LRP to the development of the Gachiani-Supsa pipeline, at issue in *Kardassopoulos,* in terms of the relative national importance of the LRP to Zimbabwe (see RHEX-014, para. 12).\n\n535.\n\nThe Respondent notes that an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations are to be evaluated as at the time when the investor made its investment, including facts known to the investor prior to making its investment (see Rejoinder, paras. 621-622). The Respondent submits that the Claimants accepted a high business risk at the time they made their respective investments (see Rejoinder, paras. 631-635). The Respondent notes that investments were made in the Border Estate from 1992 to 2007 and in Makandi from May 2005 to May 2006, but, as Ben Freeth wrote in \"Mugabe and the White African\", by 2004 the \"government was clearly in eviction mode\" (see Rejoinder, para. 635). The Respondent expresses incredulity at the Claimants\u2019 characterization of the Lancaster House Accords concluded in 1979 (see Rejoinder, paras. 645-647, 650):\n\nClaimants and the Commercial Farmers Union\u2019s position as to \"expectations\" is based on their posturing in a scenario akin to the following: Oh my, how could the Republic of Zimbabwe \"overhaul the system\" of land ownership? We never would have thought that could possibly be in their minds. After all, Ian Smith did not anticipate that for a thousand years to come! So, why should we?\n\nClaimants do not hesitate to read the African Zimbabwean\u2019s minds and to declare that \"Respondent downplays the significance of the land issue at the Lancaster House Conference.\" Significance to whom a curious mind might ask. There is no reason for this Arbitral Tribunal, faced with history today, to doubt the significance land held and continues to hold for those who risked their lives to gain control of their own country. For Americans, it would not be seen as na\u00efve to say \"The Land of the Free\"; neither should it be for Zimbabweans to hold that ideal.\n\nClaimants say that the urgent issue at the Lancaster House Accords was \"the terms of the cease fire... so as to minimize the risk of attack by Rhodesian forces.\" It was reasonable for the Freedom Fighters to consider safety as urgent given the risk of being attacked by sophisticated armed forces. It was a necessity. The term duress is in order to describe the situation at the time of the Lancaster House Accords.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe fact that \"land redistribution was just one of the key economic demands\" does not make it any less important. Even if it has been \"just one\" does not make it go away. Land redistribution has been and is key to the economic success and social stability of every post-colonial society from the United States of America, to Malaysia, to Singapore, Majority rule and land ownership by that majority go hand in hand, [citations and emphasis omitted]\n\n536.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that \"a party who enters a country covertly, at the time of admission of Investments violates the regulations, rules and policies making up the legal system of the Host State [and] cannot form any real legitimate expectations it can \u2018reasonably rely on\u2019 as to \u2018protected status\u2019\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 240). Relatedly, the Respondent criticizes the structure of the Claimants\u2019 Investments in Zimbabwe, describing their corporate organogram as an \"Impenetrable challenge\", and alleges that their economic model (one of vertical Integration) is designed to enrich the Claimants, whilst the Respondent\u2019s economic model \"is Intended to advance the public purpose cases represented by the Statue of Liberty in New York harbour... Including liberty, peace, human rights, abolition of slavery, democracy and the opportunity for the people of Zimbabwe\" (see Rejoinder, para. 788). InRHEX-1, submitted during the Hearing, the Respondent described the Claimants\u2019 Investments as \"carefully organised, nebulous, secret, off shore maze of untraceable trusts, some \u2018dormant\u2019, holding a portfolio of asserts\" (see also RHEX-007 relating to the Respondent\u2019s comments on the Claimants\u2019 organograms setting out the structure of their investments for each Estate).\n\n537.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimants knew that land reform would flow from majority rule, that Investment in Zimbabwe was risky between 1998 and 2007, and that the Claimants\u2019 expectations were based on Rhodesian business practices of the 1950s.\n\n538.\n\nThe Respondent avers that it could not counter the will of the masses and that it is \"excused for not shooting the masses\" to meet the Claimants\u2019 \"Impossible demands\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 243). The Respondent seeks to draw analogies between the LRP and the growing pains experienced by Zimbabwe since the Implementation of the LRP with other social movements and revolutions, such as French Revolution, the Russian Revolution of 1905/06, the American Revolution and the American Civil War (see Rejoinder, Section 6.5).\n\n539.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that land reform was foreseeable by the Claimants at the time they Invested in Zimbabwe. Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal must engage in a balancing of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, on the one hand, and the common Interest of the Zimbabwean people, as well as \"moral standards and International law\", on the other hand (see Rejoinder, paras. 705,1034-1036). The Respondent Invites the Tribunal to consider the respective backgrounds and Interest of the Parties. In this regard, the Respondent contrasts the noble background of the von Pezold Claimants, alleged to have familial ties to the British Monarchy, to the comparatively poor and activist background of several of the Respondent\u2019s main protagonists, namely President Mugabe, Minister Mutasa, and Ms. Tsvakwi (see Rejoinder, paras. 724 ff).\n\n540.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on Ad Article 3(a) of the German Protocol, which states that \"measures necessary for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed \u2018treatment less favourable\u2019 within the meaning of Article 3\" (emphasis added). The Respondent refers to certain of its defences to the expropriation claim, set out above, indefence to the Claimants\u2019 FET claim, namely that the expropriations were not discriminatory, were for a public purpose and followed due process. The Respondent reiterates that the Claimants remain on their land and are running \"thriving concerns\" (see CM, para. 152). The Respondent also submits that its foreign exchange policy regime was justified in the prevailing circumstances, noting that Zimbabwe has had all lines of credit withdrawn and economic sanctions Imposed on It. The Respondent refers to the IMF Articles of Agreement, which It states recognize the application of exchange control arrangements and have been Implemented Into Zimbabwean law through various legal Instruments (see CM. para. 155).\n\n541.\n\nFinally, the Respondent refers to the Calvo doctrine, by which It asserts that foreigners have the right to national treatment, but not any better treatment (see Rejoinder, paras. 409-411). The Respondent argues that the Claimants benefited from treatment at least as good as national treatment.\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimants contend the Respondent has breached the FET provisions of the German and Swiss BITs71.\n\nIt is recalled that R\u00fcdiger claims only under the German BIT, and the Border Claimants only under ther Swiss BIT.\n\n543.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the German BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 2\n\nPromotion and Protection of Investments\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible Investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and admit such Investments into its territory inaccordance with its laws. It shall in any case accord such Investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n\u2026\n\n544.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Swiss BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\nProtection, treatment\n\n(1) Investments and returns of Investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way Impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of Investments in its territory of Investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n\u2026\n\n545.\n\nThe Tribunal endorses the Claimants\u2019 description of the FET standard and finds the FET standard to be substantively the same under both the Swiss and German BITs.\n\n546.\n\nIn particular, the jurisprudence supports the Claimants\u2019 contention that a breach of FET can be based on State actions that are \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, expose the investor to sectional or racial prejudice, coerce or harass the investor, or lack due process\" and/or a breach of specific representations made to the investor (legitimate expectations). A State is thus expected to behave, as the Claimants submit, in a \"consistent, even handed, unambiguous, transparent, candid\" manner. To the extent FET incorporates the minimum standard of treatment under international law, it is clear that this standard has moved on since the *Neer* case.\n\na) Zimbabwean Properties\n------------------------\n\n547.\n\nThe relevant assurances provided by the Government and various officials to the Claimants that their investments would not be subject to expropriation are sufficient to establish the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectation that their investments would not be included in the LRP and consequently would not be subject to expropriation in breach of the BITs. The Tribunal summarizes some of these assurances below, as well as events that might have eroded these expectations. On balance, the Tribunal considers that the positive assurances are sufficiently numerous and specific to warrant the legitimate expectations claimed by the Claimants:\n\n\u2022 From 1980, Zimbabwe\u2019s policy was to take no more than 8.3 million ha of the 15.5 million ha of large scale commercial farms. Properties covered by BITs (796,000 ha) were excluded from the LRP. In 1988, the von Pezolds acquired their interest in the Forrester Estate. The Central Bank also encouraged the investment (see C-775). In March 2004, 8.3 million ha subject to the LRP was increased to 11 million ha.\n\n\u2022 In 1991, Civil Servants encouraged further investment in Forrester and Government policy was that forestry plantations would not be included in the LRP.\n\n\u2022 The von Pezolds acquired a 25% stake in Border in 1992, and from 1994-1998 Elisabeth made a series of Loans to the Forrester Estate, which remain unpaid. In 1995, there was general encouragement of German investment in Zimbabwe.\n\n\u2022 In 1998, the Zimbabwean Minister of Agriculture assured the Claimants that the Respondent would never forcibly acquire the Claimants\u2019 properties (President Mugabe later repeated this assurance).\n\n\u2022 In 2000, Zimbabwe ratified the German BIT and the Government stated that German property would be excluded from the LRP. A *Note Verbale* confirmed that property covered by BITs would not be included in the LRP (see C-227). The Zimbabwean Supreme Court also condemned the invasion of white farms and the lack of police action. In this same year, the von Pezolds acquired a further 20% interest in Border. The first Section 5 Notices were, however, issued against parts of the Border and Forrester Estates (see C-118) and the aggressive phase of the LRP began with the first \"invasions\" of the Forrester and Border Estates (athough no Settlers/War Veterans stayed on the Estates at this time).\n\n\u2022 In 2001, Zimbabwe ratified the Swiss BIT. The Zimbabwean Minister of Environment told the Claimants that forest plantations were excluded from the LRP, and LRP policy documents excluded tea, coffee, timber and citrus plantations from the LRP. However, the attempted payment of Elisabeth\u2019s loans was unsuccessful due to lack of foreign currency.\n\n\u2022 In 2002, the Zimbabwean High Court declared Section 5 Notices and Section 8 Orders to be invalid as a breach of the German BIT (Cases 8859/02 and 8892/02) and no further Notices/Orders were issued by the Government against the Forrester or Border Estates. The Zimbabwean ambassador to Germany also stated that the Government had removed all German farms from the list of farms to be expropriated. However, during this year, the Invasions started again and continued every year after settlement began.\n\n\u2022 In 2003, the von Pezolds acquired a further 37.5% interest in the Border Estate.\n\n\u2022 In 2005, several important events occurred. InMay and July, the Parent Claimants acquired an interest in the Makandi Estate. In September, the 2005 Constitutional Amendment was enacted, but in the same month the Government of Zimbabwe issued a *Note Verbale* assuring the Claimants that the Constitutional Amendment did not apply to their investments (see C-230).\n\n\u2022 In 2006, the Parent Claimants acquired an interest in the Makandi Estate.\n\n\u2022 Finally, in 2007, the Government of Zimbabwe acknowledged that the Parent Claimants\u2019 investments had been expropriated by the 2005 Constitutional Amendment.\n\n548.\n\nAs noted above, the *Note Verbale* from the Zimbabwean Government, dated 15 September 2005, assured the Claimants that the 2005 Constitutional Amendment did not apply to their investments, notwithstanding the terms of Section 16B. Specifically, the *Note Verbale* recorded the following (see C-230):\n\nBy way of a concluding observation on Section 16B, owners of agricultural land who are protected by bilateral or international investment protection agreements are not affected by Section 16B. Although the State may exercise its sovereign right to expropriate them, they will continue to be able to challenge the expropriation in our courts and to receive full compensation for agricultural land, as well as for any improvements thereon.\n\n549.\n\nIt was not until 2007 that the Government changed its mind and declared that the Constitutional Amendment had expropriated their investments.\n\n550.\n\nThe Claimants state that all Section 5 Notices and Section 8 Orders in relation to Border, Forrester and Makandi were withdrawn by the Republic or nullified by the Courts. Hence, even after these Orders/Notlces were issued, the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectation that their investments would not be expropriated remained in place.\n\n551.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds a breach of the Respondent\u2019s FET obligations in respect of the Zimbabwean Properties as of 14 September 2005, on which date the 2005 Constitutional Amendment vested title in the Zimbabwean Properties in the State.\n\nb) The Residual Properties, Zimbabwean Company Shares, and Income-Generating Assets\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe reasoning expressed above also applies *mutatis mutandis* to the the Zimbabwean Company Shares, the Residual Properties, and the Income-Generating Assets, the value of which was severely diminished by the expropriation of the Zimbabwean Properties. The fact that the Claimants were able to continue to operate on some parts of the Estates and therefore generate income is relevant primarily to the damages calculation, rather than liability. Accordingly the Tribunal finds a breach of the Respondent\u2019s FET obligations in respect of the Residual Properties, Zlmbawean Company Shares and Income-Generating Assets as of 14 September 2005, on which date the 2005 Constitutional Amendment vested title in the Zimbabwean Properties in the State.\n\nc) Forrester Water Rights\n-------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s conversion of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 Forrester Water Rights into Water Permits on 1 January 2000 through Implementation of the *Water Act 1998* constituted a breach of its FET obligations.\n\n554.\n\nThe *Water Act 1976,* which created the Forrester Water Rights, provided that compensation would be paid if the Water Rights were ever amended. When the Forrester Water Rights were converted into Water Permits from 1 January 2000, however, no such compensation was paid by the Respondent. This reversal of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations that the Forrester Water Rights would be protected, coupled with the significant change in the nature of the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 rights that accompanied the transition to the Water Permit regime (i.e., implementation of a finite duration for the Water Permits and the imposition of levies), constitutes in the Tribunal\u2019s view a clear breach of the Respondent\u2019s FET obligations from 1 January 2000.\n\nd) Forrester Loans\n------------------\n\n555.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s failure to release currency to allow the Forrester Loans to be repaid to Elisabeth constitutes a clear breach of the Respondent\u2019s FET obligations. This is particularly so given that the economic difficulties that may have facilitated the currency shortage were the direct result of the Government\u2019s own policies.\n\n556.\n\nFrom 31 December 2001, the date on which the Respondent refused to release foreign currency to enable due repayment of the principal and interest of the Forrester Loans (see Cl. Skeleton, para. 120), the Respondent was accordingly in breach of its obligation to treat Elisabeth\u2019s investment fairly and equitably.\n\ne) Foreign Exchange Measures\n----------------------------\n\n557.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 assertion that the Respondent breached its FET obligations through its Foreign Exchange Measures, as a result of the \"grossly unfair, idiosyncratic, arbitrary and bad faith manner in which the Respondent set and used the Official Rates of Exchange\". Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s imposition of the relevant Foreign Exchange Measures against the Claimants constitutes a breach of its FET obligations.\n\n558.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard in this respect caused the Claimants to suffer three distinct losses: (i) the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall; (ii) the Forrester Conversion Amount; and (iii) the Border Liquidation Shortfall. The Tribunal accordingly finds a breach in respect of each of these Heads of Damage.\n\n559.\n\nIn respect of the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall and the Border Liquidation Shortfall, the FET breach occurred on 1 January 2004, the date on which the Respondent\u2019s foreign currency requirements came into force (see SI 9 - Exchange Control (Currency Exchange) Order 2004, Section 7(1), CLEX-47). In respect of the Forrester Conversion Amount, the relevant breach occurred on 31 December 2008, at which time the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe refused to release 25% of the Claimants\u2019 tobacco sales in US Dollars as required (see Cl. Skeleton, para. 122).\n\nf) Respondent\u2019s Ad Article 3(a) defence\n---------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nIn defence of the FET allegations ingeneral, the Respondent relies on Ad Article 3(a) of the German Protocol, which states that \"measures necessary for public security and order... or morality shall not be deemed \u2018treatment less favourable\u2019 within the meaning of Article 3\". However, the FET standard is contained in Article 2 of the BIT and is therefore not subject to Ad Article 3(a). The Tribunal therefore dismisses this defence.\n\ng) Conclusion\n-------------\n\n561.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have established a breach of the FET standard contained in Article 2(1) of the German BIT and Article 4(1) of the Swiss BIT by falling to accord the Claimants FET in connection with (a) the Zimbabwean Properties; (b) the Residual Properties, Zimbabwean Company Shares and Income-Generating Assets; (c) the Forrester Water Rights; (d) the Forrester Loans; (e) the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall; (f) the Forester Conversion Amount; and (g) the Border Liquidation Shortfall. The quantification of damages for these breaches will be considered below.\n\n(3) Impairment or Diminishment\n------------------------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n562.\n\nThe Claimants Invoke Article 5(5) of the Danish BIT through the MFN clauses of the German and Swiss BITs, respectively, to assert a comparably more favourable provision than in the German and Swiss BITs in connection with the compensation of shareholders in the Zimbabwean Companies for losses arising from measures directed at the Zimbabwean Companies as imparing or diminishing their value.\n\n563.\n\nThe Claimants state that the effect of these provisions in this case is as follows (see Mem., para. 1337):\n\nTherefore in summary, under Article 6(2) of the Swiss BIT and Article 5(5) of the Danish BIT, the first precondition for compensation is that the host state has expropriated the assets of a Zimbabwean company. However, under Ad Article 4 of the German Protocol, a precondition for compensation is that the host state has expropriated the assets of a Zimbabwean company or breached the full security and protection standard in regard to it (the Claimants do not rely on the full security and protection standard for the purpose of its impairment cause of action).\n\n564.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent has expropriated the underlying assets of the Forrester Companies, the Border Companies and the Makandi Companies through the 2005 Constitutional Amendment and therefore the first condition of Article 6(2) of the Swiss BIT and Article 5(5) of the Danish BIT has been satisfied. The above provisions provide for compensation to be paid to shareholders. However, the Claimants take the position that the threshold of damage that must occur to those shares before compensation is paid to the shareholders is lower in the Danish BIT than in the German and Swiss BITs; therefore the Claimants rely on the standard of \"any\" Impairment suffered as set out in the Danish BIT. The Claimants refer to the *Saluka* tribunal\u2019s discussion of the meaning of \"Impairment\", which found this term to mean any negative effect or Impact (see Mem., paras. 1350-1351 referring to *Saluka,* CLEX-217).\n\n565.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent appears to have accepted Mr. Levitt\u2019s evidence that a reduction in the value of the underlying assets causes an equal reduction in the value of the Shares (see Cl. PHB, para. 144, referring to CM, para. 151; Levitt II, para. 1.02.1) (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, Corrected CE-7). The Claimants reason that, as the Claimants\u2019 Properties were the only valuable assets held by the Zimbabwean Companies, and none of the other investments have any value without the Zimbabwean Properties, it must therefore follow that the expropriation of the Zimbabwean Properties has rendered the Forrester, Border and Makandi Shares worthless inbreach of the above standard. The Claimants note that compensation has not been paid for the Shares.\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n566.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s only apparent defence to this cause of action is that the Claimants have in fact been compensated by continuing to enjoy substantially unencumbered use of the Estates (see Resp. PHB, para. 239; CM, para. 151).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n567.\n\nThe Claimants Invoke Article 5(5) of the Danish BIT, which contains an Impairment and Diminishment standard, through the MFN clauses of the German and Swiss BITs72, respectively, to assert a comparably more favourable provision than in the German and Swiss BITs, and assert that the Respondent has breached this standard73. The Claimants rely on this clause specifically in relation to the Zimbabwean Company Shares.\n\nSpecificially, Article 3(1) and 3(2) of the German BIT and Article 4(2) of the Swiss BIT.\n\nIt is recalled that R\u00fcdiger claims only under the German BIT, and the Border Claimants only under the Swiss BIT.\n\n568.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s above findings on expropriation, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide this issue, as it would have no substantive effect on the compensation due to the Claimants.\n\n569.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds this issue to be moot.\n\n(4) Non-Impairment\n------------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached Article 2(2) of the German BIT and Article 4(1) of the Swiss BIT.\n\n571.\n\nThe Claimants note that the operative terms of the non-impairment standard in the BITs have been interpreted by other investor-State tribunals in the context of similar provisions. Thus, for example, the Claimants refer to the meaning given to the term \"reasonable\" by the tribunal in *Siag* (CLEX-243) and to the terms \"reasonable\" and \"non-discrimination\" by the tribunal in *Saluka* (CLEX-217). The *Saluka* tribunal found that reasonableness requires a showing that the State\u2019s conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy and that non-discrimination requires a rational justification of any differential treatment of a foreign investor (see CLEX-217, para. 60). Similarly, the Claimants refer to the discussion of the term \"arbitrary\" by the tribunals in *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (CLEX-210) and *Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine*  ***(\"Lemire\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010, CLEX-318), where both tribunals defined the terms by reference to the substitution of reason or rule of law for prejudice, preference or bias (see CLEX-210, para. 162 and CLEX-318, para. 263). The Claimants refer to *Saluka* for an interpretation of the term \"impair\", as also discussed above in connection with the non-diminishment and impairment standard (see Mem., paras. 1470-1479).\n\n572.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the same conduct that breaches the FET standard also breaches the standards in Article 2(2) of the German BIT and Article 4(1) of the Swiss BIT (see Mem., para. 1481).\n\n573.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the LRP measures damaged and devalued their investments because the Claimants have lost title to the majority of the Claimants\u2019 Properties, leaving the remainder uneconomical; the use and enjoyment of these Properties has been impaired because Settlers/War Veterans have destroyed infrastructure, occupied land, disrupted the cropping rotation, and harassed staff; and without title the Claimants cannot dispose of the Zimbabwean Properties. Inregard to the foreign exchange measures, the Claimants contend that the measures impaired their use of the proceeds of sale on farm and timber products because the Respondent denied them the amounts they should have received. Finally, in regard to the Forrester Loans, the Claimants submit that the Respondent prevented them from being repaid (see Cl. Skel., para. 143).\n\n574.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the evidence elicited during the Hearing as to the disproportionality, lack of due process and compensation, and absence of public purpose in connection with the LRP to establish breach of the non-impairment standard. The Claimants also referto the evidence elicited during the Hearing that the Respondent\u2019s foreign exchange policy was inbreach of local law and IMF rules to support its position that the policy was unreasonable and arbitrary inbreach of the non-impairment standard (see Cl. Skel., para. 143; Cl. PHB, para. 156).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n575.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has demonstrated that the LRP was \"ineluctable\", for a reasonable public purpose, non-discriminatory and not arbitrary, and therefore the Claimants\u2019 non-impairment claim falls (see Resp. PHB, para. 247).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached Article 2(2) of the German BIT74 and Article 4(1) of the Swiss BIT. Article 2(2) of the German BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 2\n\nPromotion and Protection of Investments\n\n\u2026\n\n(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investment in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\n\nIt is recalled that R\u00fcdiger claims only under the German BIT, and the Border Claimants only under the Swiss BIT..\n\n577.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Swiss BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\nProtection, treatment\n\n(1) Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Partyshall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party.... [emphasis added]\n\n578.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s actions have resulted in a breach of this provision of the Swiss and German BITs by impairing, *inter alia,* the Claimants\u2019 use, management, enjoyment and disposal of their investments.\n\n579.\n\nIn relation to the occupations (including, without limitation, failure to prevent them and/or remove Settlers/War Veterans, providing assistance to Settlers/War Veterans, issuing offer letters etc.), the Respondent impaired the Claimants\u2019 ability to farm the Estates effectively. However, given that the Claimants retained use of large sections of the properties, the economic impact may not have been so great had the Government not also expropriated the properties through the 2005 Constitutional Amendment. Clearly, the expropriation has impaired use, enjoyment and - in particular - disposal such that the non-impairment clause has been breached.\n\n580.\n\nThis provision is also particularly apt in relation to the foreign currency issues. The Tribunal is persuaded that the Government\u2019s refusal to release foreign currency to allow the Forrester Loans to be repaid to Elisabeth and the Government\u2019s forcing of the Claimants to exchange currency at artificial rates impaired the use and enjoyment of funds generated by the Estates.\n\n581.\n\nUnder the German BIT, the impairment must be caused by \"unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory measures\", and similarly for the Swiss BIT by \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\". For the reasons that have already been set out above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s behaviour was unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory. Accordingly, the Claimants have, in respect of all these investments additionally established a breach of the nonimpairment provisions of the BITs.\n\n(5) Full Protection and Security\n--------------------------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached Article 4(1) of the German and Swiss BITs, which provide that the investments of German and Swiss investors shall be granted FPS. They also invoke, in tandem, Article 18 of the Zimbabwean Constitution, which provides that \"every person is entitled to protection of the law\".\n\n583.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Parties agree that the above standards require the State to act vigilantly and take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of protection and security of the investor\u2019s investment (see PHB, para. 157; Respondent RHEX-22, para. 2 citing *Saluka,* paras. 483-484, which in turn cites *American Manufacturing and Trading Inc. v. Zaire,* para. 6.05, CLEX-178).\n\n584.\n\nThe Claimants note the Respondent\u2019s opening statement during the Hearing that the standard requires the State to show that it has met these requirements. Specifically, counsel for the Respondent stated the following, by reference to the *Saluka* award (see Tr. Day 2, pp. 381-382):\n\nAnd so if we come to a more legal aspect infull protection and security, I refer to the partial award in Saluka Investments v. The Czech Republic, which says in Paragraph 484, \"The standard does not imply strict liability of the host State however.\" The Tecmed Tribunal held that \"the guarantee of full protection in [sic] security is not absolute and does not impose strict liability upon the State that grants it.\" And it refers specifically to, \"Accordingly, the standard obliges the host State to adopt all reasonable measures to protect assets and property from threats or attacks which may target particularly foreigners\" or certain groups of foreigners. But, you know, it\u2019s a situation where we\u2019re talking about a reasonable standard.\n\n\u2026\n\n585.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the following constitute breaches of the FPS standard (see Cl. Skel., para. 147):\n\n\u2022 Failure to stop the Invasions and to remove the Settlers/War Veterans (see Heinrich I, paras. 584-586; *Commissioner of Police v. CFU,* p. 477E, CLEX-76);\n\n\u2022 Instructing the police not to act and the police accepting those Instructions (see Mugabe statements, C-460; Police Commissioner\u2019s statement, C-448; *Commissioner of Police v. CFU,* pp. 515 and 516, CLEX-75);\n\n\u2022 Issuing \"Offer Letters\" Instructing people to come onto the Claimants\u2019 properties;\n\n\u2022 Assisting people incoming onto the Claimants\u2019 Properties (see*CFU v. Minister of Lands & Ors,* p. 477E-G and 482, CLEX-76; Chan I, para. 32, C-37; Heinrich I, paras. 575-586, C-18; and local press reports, C-449 and C-460); and\n\n\u2022 Making public statements that may reasonably be expected to Initiate or prompt harassment and violence against the Claimants (which in fact occurred) (see press reports, C-449 and C-460).\n\n586.\n\nThe Claimants referto the following additional evidence elicited at the Hearing of the Respondent\u2019s breach of the FPS provisions (see Cl. PHB, para. 157):\n\n\u2022 Minister Mutasa\u2019s admission that the government transported Settlers/War Veterans on to the farms, provided them with food and allocated them with units of lands (see Tr. Day 5, pp. 1415-1416); and\n\n\u2022 The Involvement of the State in the Invasions as confirmed by Professor Chan, Mr. Theron and Ms. Tsvakwi (see Cl. PHB, paras. 113-115 and references therein).\n\n587.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the evidence of Heinrich as to the force that would be necessary to remove Settlers/War Veterans from the farms. Heinrich\u2019s evidence was that, in the few Instances where Settlers/War Veterans have been removed, they have been removed inlarge numbers without the use of firearms, and that the Settlers/War Veterans on the Estates today do not carry firearms (see Heinrich V, paras. 40-41, C-776). Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the removal of Settlers/War Veterans, if they resisted, would only require reasonable and proportionate force (see Cl. PHB, para. 158).\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimants note the Respondent\u2019s pleading that, pursuant to Article 4(3) of the German BIT and Article 7(1) of the Swiss BIT, full protection and security need not be provided in instances of \"war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency or revolt and insurrection or riot\". The Claimants disagree that this is an appropriate interpretation of these provisions and aver that the purpose of such provisions is to provide a floor of treatment, as opposed to a ceiling, in the event the circumstances stated therein occur (see Cl. PHB, para. 159).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n589.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Invasions were not planned or directed by the Respondent and that they happened spontaneously and across the country such that the police were overwhelmed. Thus, the Respondent explains that constraints on the Zimbabwean police led to the Claimants facing the treatment complained of. The Respondent notes that, to arrest the situation, the Respondent reacted by putting into place legal instruments to enable the acquisition of more land for redistribution. The Respondent has also noted that the Claimants wished to have all Settlers/War Veterans removed from their property, thus failing to make a distinction between \"invaders\" and \"land beneficiaries\" who were lawfully settled in terms of the LRP (see CM, paras. 156-158).\n\n590.\n\nThe Respondent avers that \"Rhodesian style security\" is not the standard under these treaty provisions. The Respondent also submits that it exercised due diligence \"as reasonable under the circumstances and that more brutal intervention could have led to many deaths, particularly under the volatile circumstances of the spontaneous uprisings of the land hungry masses\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 249). The Respondent notes that Elisabeth acknowledged during the Hearing that one can never have a complete guarantee of personal safety (see *ibid.* *,* para. 250).\n\n591.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the choice not to have the Zimbabwean police fire upon the Zimbabwean people was the right choice (see Rejoinder, para. 359). The Respondent asserts that, in their demands for full protection and security, the Claimants \"fail to distinguish between an isolated event where police protection would be possible and even normal from a national-wide uprisings [sic] in the control of a pent up explosive national consciousness in mobs where police intervention would risk being deadly\" (see Rejoinder, para. 356). The Respondent relies on accounts in Ben Freeth\u2019s book \"Mugabe and the White African\" in support of its position that the State risked great bloodshed If It had attempted to assert greater control through its police (see Rejoinder, para. 374-375).\n\n592.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Article 4(3) of the German BIT and Article 7(1) of the Swiss BIT recognize that the concept of \"full security\" is not applicable incertain circumstances, such as, under the German BIT, incases of \"war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency or revolt\", and under the Swiss BIT, incases of \"war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, Insurrection or riot in the territory\" (see RHEX-022, para. 4).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n593.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached Article 4(1) of the German75 and Swiss BITs, which provide that the Investments of German and Swiss Investors shall be granted FPS. They also invoke, in tandem, Article 18 of the Zlmbawean Constitution, which provides that \"every person is entitled to protection of the law\".\n\nIt is recalled that R\u00fcdiger claims only under the German BIT, and that the Border Claimants only under the Swiss BIT.\n\n594.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the German BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\nProtection and safeguards\n\n(1) Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n595.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Swiss BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\nProtection, treatment\n\n(1) Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Partyshall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party.....[emphasis added]\n\n596.\n\nThe Parties agree that the FPS standard is not a strict liability test, but is an \"all reasonable measures\" (i.e., a due diligence) standard. The Tribunal also considers that this standard relates to physical security and threats of violence and is materially the same under both BITs.\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent has breached this FPS standard in relation to the failure of police to protect the Claimants\u2019 properties from occupation or to remove Settlers/War Veterans. The Tribunal also finds that the Respondent breached this standard in relation to the nonresponsiveness of police to various violent incidents that occurred, as detailed in the Witness Statements of, for example, Heinrich von Pezold and John Gadzikwa.\n\n598.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that the exception in the BITs for situations of war, revolution, etc. does not apply in the present case. The Respondent\u2019s further defences that the police were overwhelmed, or that intervention would have required disproportional force, were also unconvincing.\n\n599.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent breached its obligations under the BITs to provide full protection and security to the Claimants in respect of the Claimants\u2019 Properties. In light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding in respect of the FPS standard in the BITs, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the Claimants\u2019 arguments regarding Section 18 of the Constitution.\n\n(6) Free Transfer of Payments\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n600.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent breached Article 5 of the German BIT and of the Swiss BIT, which provide that the Respondent must guarantee to German and Swiss investors FTP in connection with an investment, including the transfer of \"returns\" on investment and the \"repayment of loans\".\n\n601.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the above standards, set out in the BITs, establish a *lex specialis* for the regulation of foreign currency and the free transfer of payments, and that these standards are incorporated into the 1996 Exchange Control Regulations at ss. 28 and 29 (see CLEX-38). Sections 28 and 29 of the 1996 Regulations provide as follows:\n\nRemittability of funds\n\n28. (1) Subject to subsection (2), a person who receives or is entitled to receive any of the following amounts shall have the right to remit the whole or any part of the amount concerned out of Zimbabwe\u2014\n\n(a) In the case of an Individual, money held by him in a foreign currency account;\n\n(b) any dividend or Interest, up to such maximum amount as may be prescribed, on a security acquired by that person from money held in a foreign currency account;\n\n(c) without derogation from section 29, any amount which the recipient has the right to remit out of Zimbabwe interms of any enactment or any convention, treaty or agreement to which the Government is a party;\n\n(2) The remittance of any amount referred to in subsection (1) shall be effected through an authorised dealer.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to preclude the remittance out of Zimbabwe of any amount with the permission of an exchange control authority.\n\nGrant of permission, authority, etc\n\n29. (1) Where\u2014\n\n(a) any person has acquired a right to do anything or an entitlement to anything in terms of any enactment or any convention, treaty or agreement to which the Government is a party; and\n\n(b) that right or entitlement is by these regulations subject to permission or authority granted by an exchange control authority;\n\nthe exchange control authority shall without delay grant the permission or authority necessary to enable the person to exercise his right or obtain the benefit of his entitlement, as the case may be.\n\n(2) Subsection (1) shall apply where the enactment, convention, treaty or agreement which confers the right or entitlement concerned provides, expressly or by implication, that the right or entitlement is to be exercised subject to permission or authority granted under these regulations.\n\n602.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the effect of the standards is that the State must permit an investor to transfer funds out of the country if the investor has the necessary funds to do so, and that it amounts to a promise that, in all circumstances, it will have sufficient foreign currency reserves available to German and Swiss Investors so that it can honour its obligations under the standard (see Cl. Skel., para. 150; referring to *Biwater,* para. 735, CLEX-233).\n\n603.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent breached this standard on 31 December 2001 when it refused to release the necessary foreign currency in order to enable the Forrester Estate to repay the foreign currency Forrester Loans to Elisabeth. The Claimants also allege that, between 2004 and 2008, the Respondent forced the von Pezold Claimants to be paid for their tobacco in Zimbabwean Dollars; that between 2003 and 2009, the Respondent forced the Claimants to exchange some of their US Dollar proceeds from the Border Estate\u2019s exports inreturn for Zimbabwean Dollars; and finally that the Respondent has refused to release US Dollars that were earned through the sale of tobacco (that is, the Forrester Tobacco Shortfall, the Border Liquidation Shortfall and the Forrester Conversion Amount). The result is that the Claimants have been unable to transfer their returns on Investment out of Zimbabwe (see Cl. Skel., para. 151).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n604.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s only direct response to this claim is that land reform constitutes a legitimate public purpose and that this suffices to qualify the measure of land reform and the ensuing police power decisions as being \"a normal exercise of non-compensable police powers irrespective of the magnitude of its effects on the investment\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 252).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n605.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent breached Article 5 of the German BIT76 and of the Swiss BIT, which provide that the Respondent must guarantee to German and Swiss investors FTP in connection with an investment, including the transfer of \"returns\" on investment and the \"repayment of loans\".\n\nIt is recalled that R\u00fcdiger claims only under the German BIT, and the Border Claimants only under the Swiss BIT.\n\n606.\n\nArticle 5 of the German BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 5\n\nTransfer of Funds\n\nEach Contracting Party shall guarantee to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party the free transfer of payments in connection with an Investment, in particular:\n\na) of the principal and additional amounts to establish, maintain or Increase the Investment;\n\nb) of the return;\n\nc) Inrepayment of loans;\n\nd) of royalties and fees for the rights referred to in Article 1.1.d);\n\ne) of the proceeds from the liquidation or sale of the whole or any part of the Investment;\n\nf) of the compensation provided for in Article 4.\n\n607.\n\nArticle 5 of the Swiss BIT provides as follows:\n\nArticle 5\n\nFree transfer\n\nEach Contracting Party inwhose territory investments have been made by Investors of the other Contracting Party shall grant those Investors the free transfer of the payments relating to these Investments, particularly of:\n\n(a) returns;\n\n(b) repayments of loans;\n\n(c) amounts assigned to cover expenses relating to the management of the Investment;\n\n(d) royalties and other payments deriving from right enumerated in Article 1, paragraph (2), letters (c), (d) and (e) of this Agreement;\n\n(e) additional contributions of capital necessary for the maintenance or development of the Investment;\n\n(f) the proceeds of the sale or of the partial or total liquidation of the Investment, including possible Increment values.\n\n608.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent breached this provision of the Swiss BIT in refusing to release foreign currency to allow the Forrester Estate to repay the Loans to Elisabeth in 2001.\n\n609.\n\nThe FTP provisions were further breached between 2004 and 2008 when the Respondent forced the Claimants to be paid for tobacco in Zimbabwean Dollars and between 2003 and 2009 when it forced the Claimants to exchange US currency for Zimbabwean Dollars (the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall and the Border Liquidation Shortfall). The Respondent\u2019s failure to release US Dollars earned through the sale of tobacco also breached this standard (the Forrester Conversion Amount).\n\n(7) Necessity\n-------------\n\n(i) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n610.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there was a state of emergency in effect in Zimbabwe from 16 February 2000 until 16 March 2013 which posed a real threat to the \"ongoingness\" of the State, and that the only way to safeguard the \"ongoingness\" of the State was to implement the FTLRP.\n\n611.\n\nThe March of History, the Respondent submits, commenced on 16 February 2000 and was an \"ineluctable\" event (see Resp. Skel., para. 128.). This event is submitted to have commenced with an attempt by the \"masses to negotiate with the commercial farmers\" over the resettlement of said masses onto land legally possessed by these commercial farmers (see *ibid* *.,* para. 82). This culminated in the occupation of over 1,000 plots of land by Settlers/War Veterans (see *ibid.)* *.* The Respondent asserts that the Settlers/War Veterans were motivated by anger, fuelled by \"land-hungriness, and fed not by government but by families, husbands, friends and relatives of the occupiers\" (see *ibid)* *.* It is argued that this motivation was further spurred by the prior success of the Settlers/War Veterans and accordingly history had forged the popular view that physical occupation of land was the most effective means of bringing about land reform (see *ibid.* *,* para. 108). Insupport, the Respondent cites witness statements from occupiers that indicate that, in early 2000, the \"objective was to frustrate the white farmer until he could no longer operate effectively and left\" (see *ibid.* *,* para. 167).\n\n612.\n\nPrior to 2000, the Respondent highlights that it had no Issues with servicing its foreign debts and was well regarded in the financial markets with its capital account traditionally insurplus (see *ibid.)* *.* However, by 2006, the opposite held true. From 2007 to 2009 the economy had entered a crisis of catastrophic proportions (see *ibid.* *,* paras. 913-918). This crisis had been the result of a number of factors, namely: (i) a decline inexport performance and reduced capital Inflows; (ii) a corresponding decline inforeign exchange reserves, and a significant build-up of external payments arrears, which had reached US$2.5 billion by the end of 2006; (iii) the suspension of all forms of payments support from multilateral financial Institutions; (iv) the Implementation of sanctions; (v) the suspension of technical assistance, grants, and Infrastructure development Inflows to both the Government and private sector; and (vi) the cessation of lending to the State. This also had the effect of degrading the International community\u2019s perceptions of the State and affected the ability of Zimbabwean companies to access affordable credit, forcing them to pay above-market Interest rates. Accordingly, unemployment Increased and standards of living decreased, leading to large outflows of skilled labour (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n613.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the legal test for establishing a state of necessity is found in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The Respondent frames its case for necessity under Article 25 as follows (see Rejoinder, para. 863):\n\n... Necessity is invoked by the State of Zimbabwe as a ground for precluding any wrongfulness of acts not in conformity with an international obligation of that State because the act of land reform: a) is the only way for the State of Zimbabwe to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and b) land reform in Zimbabwe does not seriously impair an essential interest of Germany and/or Switzerland, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n614.\n\nThe Respondent notes that an \"essential Interest\" is to be determined based on the particular conditions in which the State finds itself in a given situation, and submits that the mass movements of the landless Zimbabweans presented a serious and Imminent danger to an essential Interest (see *ibid.**,* paras. 869-870). The Respondent does not define the \"essential Interest\" in this case, but argues that \"a grave danger to the existence of the State itself, to its political and economic survival\" constitutes conditions of necessity under International law and suggests that the \"ongoingness\" of the State was threatened through the uprisings In 2000 (see Resp. PHB, para. 208; see also RHEX-014, para. 13, where the Respondent analogizes the LRP to the Gachlanl-Supsa pipeline *(Kardassopoulos)* to Illustrate its national Importance; see also RHEX-020, paras. 9-13; *LG&E* *Energy Corp et al v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"LG&E\")*** (see ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, paras. 246, 251, CLEX-221) and *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*  ***(\"Continental Casualty\")*** (see ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, para. 175, CLEX-236). The Respondent states that the absence of a local decree of emergency does not concern the International law analysis that the relevant events were an emergency posing a real threat to the ongoingness of the State of Zimbabwe (see Resp. PHB, paras. 210, 306).\n\n615.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon *LG&E* for the proposition that the damages suffered during the state of necessity should be borne by the Claimants (see Rejoinder, para. 877; Resp. PHB, para. 308). The Respondent reasons that the facts in *LG&E* are analogous to those here, although the Respondent contends that the facts here are even more dramatic than those at play in *LG&E.* The Respondent notes that all of the major economic indicators of the Zimbabwean economy reached catastrophic proportions in 2007, 2008 and 2009; multilateral financial institutions suspended all forms of balance of payments support, technical assistance, grants, and infrastructural development flows to government and the private sector in Zimbabwe, and stopped all lending operations to the country. The Respondent notes the following additional indicators of crisis (see Rejoinder, paras. 913-918):\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s balance of payments position has deteriorated significantly since 2000 from the combined effects of Inadequate export performance and reduced capital Inflows. Foreign exchange reserves declined as a result, from US 830m representing three months Import cover in 1996 to less than one month\u2019s cover by 2006. The foreign exchange shortages severely constrained the country\u2019s capacity to meet foreign payment obligations and finance critical Imports such as drugs, grain, raw materials, fuel and electricity.\n\nThere has been a significant build up inexternal payments arrears. Total foreign payments arrears Increased from US$109m at the end of 1999 to US$2.5bn by the end of 2006. The worsening of the country\u2019s creditworthiness and its risk profile has led to the drying up of sources of external finance. The withdrawal of the multilateral financial Institutions from providing balance of payments support to Zimbabwe has also had an effect on some bilateral creditors and donors who have followed suit by either scaling down or suspending disbursements on existing loans to the government and parastatal companies.\n\nPrior to these developments, Zimbabwe had an Impeccable record of prompt debt servicing and was highly rated in the International financial markets. The capital account, traditionally a surplus account, has been indeficit since 2000. As such, International Investors preferred other countries for Investment, thus depriving Zimbabwe of much-needed foreign direct Investment. Sanctions have also affected the Image of the country through negative perceptions by the International community. Zimbabwean companies are thus finding It extremely difficult to access lines of credit. As a result, our companies have to pay cash for Imports.\n\nAlso as a result of the risk premium, the country\u2019s private companies have been securing offshore funds at prohibitive Interest rates. This has had a ripple effect on employment levels and low capacity utilisation as reflected by shortages of basic goods and services. Declining export performance has also adversely affected the standards of living for the general population, and because of the deteriorating economic conditions, the country has experienced large scale emigration, especially of skilled labour, thus further straining the economy.\n\nThe sanctions have adversely Impacted on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Zimbabwe. Investors are shying away and FDI Inflows have collapsed from US$444.3m in 1998 to US$50m In 2006. In addition, Anglo-American companies have been strongly discouraged from Investing in Zimbabwe by their home governments. This has adversely affected Investment levels into the country, thus accentuating the foreign exchange shortages leading to further shortages of fuel and imported raw materials. The shortage of fuel has had a debilitating impact on all sectors of the economy, leading to continuous decline in economic activity. This has generated additional inflationary pressures and speculative behaviour in the economy....\n\nIn response to the Zimbabwe land reform programme, sanctions have been imposed on the Republic of Zimbabwe by multilateral financial institutions. Such sanctions and the suspension of international support have devastated economic and social a like in Zimbabwe. The heaviest blows have fallen on the poor, the young and i11....\n\n616.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the decisions of the respective tribunals in *LG&E* and *Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v. Slovakia)*  ***(Gabcikovo-Nagymaros)*** (see 1997 Judgment, I.C.J. (25 September) CLEX-396), support its essential Interest (and broader necessity) submission (see *ibid.* *,* paras. 127-131 generally). However, the Respondent does not cite any specific parts of the respective decisions as authority for its claim. Instead, the submissions point only to general statements made by the respective tribunals on the effect of a successful necessity plea (i.e., as precluding wrongfulness) (see e.g., *ibid.* *,* para. 130, which cites para. 261 of the *LG&E* decision, which states that a State that successfully Invokes necessity is excluded from any wrongfulness caused by the act of the State and, therefore, the State is exempt from liability).\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 Position\n------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe Claimants agree that the legal test for establishing the defence of necessity under International law is set out in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n618.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, throughout the entirety of the time that the Respondent claims the state of necessity took place, not once did the Government declare a state of emergency or pass a similar resolution. Accordingly, there was never any threat to an essential Interest of the State (see Cl. Skel., para. 152). Insupport of this, the Claimants also adduce evidence of a *Note Verbale* Issued by the Zimbabwean Government on 16 September 2005 explaining that the 2005 Constitutional Amendment had not affected the Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n619.\n\nCiting *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros,* the Claimants note that the elements of necessity are cumulative and are not self-judging (see *ibid.* *, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros,* p. 51, CLEX-396) and, citing the *Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory*  ***(\u2018Construction of a Waif\u2019)***(see 2004 I.C.J. 136, Advisory Opinion, p. 140, CLEX-211), the conditions upon which necessity may be Invoked must be \"exceptional\". The Claimants contend that none of the elements have been met on the evidence in these cases (see Cl. Skel., paras. 153-159). The Claimants note, for example, that the police were capable of dealing with the so-called \"mass movements\", as found by Zimbabwe\u2019s courts, that the aggressive phases of the LRP targeted the Claimants because they are white and therefore breached the prohibition against discrimination (i.e., they breached an essential interest of the international community as a whole), and that the BITs implicitly exclude the defence of necessity (see Cl. Skel., paras. 154-157: see also*BG Group,* para. 409, CLEX-231). The Claimants further note that, during the Hearing, the Respondent\u2019s witnesses conceded that not all of the required elements had been satisfied (see Cl. PHB, paras. 162-164):\n\n\u2022 Minister Mutasa stated that the Government had transported Settlers/War Veterans onto the farms, provided them with food and allocated them with units of land, thereby acknowledging that the State \"contributed to the situation of necessity\" (see Tr. Day 5, p. 1415);\n\n\u2022 Professor Chan\u2019s evidence that once the Invasions began in 2000, the Government quickly mobilised to provide material support to the Settlers/War Veterans, thereby expanding the Invasions from being a local event in Masvingo Province to expanding throughout the country, and that the President\u2019s Office and the CIO were very much involved in the direction of the Invasions (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 935-936, 938, 948, 949, 969);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Theron\u2019s evidence that vehicles with government markings were used to transport Settlers/War Veterans onto farms (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 657-658); and\n\n\u2022 Ms. Tsvakwi\u2019s evidence that the Respondent issued Offer Letters to Settlers/War Veterans instructing them to take up possession of the plots of land identified in the Offer Letter (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1246).\n\n620.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to the Expert Report of Mr. de Bourbon, SC, in which he stated that, pursuant to Section 31(1) of the Zimbabwean Constitution, the President had the powerto declare a state of emergency and that, pursuant to Section 31(6), Parliament had the powerto resolve that such a situation existed. Mr. de Bourbon opined that the President and Parliament could only exercise such powers if there were grave threats to society and the State, and that the threats in question were imminent. The Claimants reason that the test under Zimbabwe\u2019s Constitution is therefore the same as the test set out in Article 25 of the ILC Articles. The Claimants further note that Minister Mutasa testified during the Hearing that, between 1 January 2000 and 2013, neither the President nor the Parliament exercised their powers to declare/resolve that a state of emergency existed, and that, if there had been a state of emergency, this would have been declared (see Cl. PHB, para. 163; see also Tr. Day 5, pp. 1357-1358).\n\n621.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that, even if the elements of the necessity defence were established, Article 26 of the ILC Articles prevents the existence of a state of necessity from precluding the wrongfulness of an act that breaches an obligation arising under a peremptory norm.\n\n622.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 case that the LRP breached the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of race, which they say is a peremptory norm, and the Respondent\u2019s conduct is therefore wrongful in any event (see Cl. PHB, para. 165).\n\n623.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s reliance on Ad Article 3(a) of the German Protocol, the Claimants observe that the provision of the US-Argentlna BIT (to which the Respondent seeks to draw a parellel), is much broader than Ad Article 3(a), such that the awards in *LG&E* and *Continental Casualty* are Inapposite. Moreover, the Claimants aver that they do not allege a breach of the national treatment and MFN standards of the BITs inregard to the Respondent\u2019s conduct, and therefore Ad Article 3(a) is not relevant (see Cl. PHB, para. 167).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n624.\n\nWhile the Claimants have reasoned that the test under the Zimbabwean Constitution is the same as the test set out in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, the international law analysis is not affected by the domestic test which gives rise to a state of emergency. Accordingly, a domestic declaration of a state of emergency can only serve as evidence of a state of emergency that may give rise to a necessity defence under International law. Under customary International law, the Parties agree (see Rejoinder, para. 860; Cl. Skel., para. 152) that the test for establishing the defence of necessity is set out in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, which provides as follows:\n\nArticle 25. Necessity\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril;\n\nand\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\n625.\n\nThe Tribunal shall consider each element in turn.\n\na) Essential Interest\n---------------------\n\n626.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent\u2019s submission on the State\u2019s \"essential interest\" is threefold: (a) the existence of the State itself; (b) its political survival; and (c) its economic survival (see Resp. Skel, para. 128). The Respondent submits that the threat to its essential interest was the result of a spontaneous occupation of land by Settlers/War Veterans in what it calls the \"March of History\" (see *ibid.* *,* paras. 81 and 132). The Tribunal notes that the Settlers/War Veterans, although termed \"non-Governmental\", were instrumental in the struggle for \"liberation\" that preceded the Lancaster House Conference and the birth of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\n627.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the existence of a State, as well as the maintenance of the public order of a State, is an essential interest (see Cl. Skel., para. 153). However, the Claimants assert that the plight of landless Zimbabweans is not an essential interest, nor is placing them in possession of land at the expense of the legitimate landowner while revoking the landowners\u2019 legal rights of recourse (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n628.\n\nThe Parties are correct in their affirmation that the existence of a State, as well as the maintenance of public order of a State, is an essential interest, and therefore applicable to ILC Article 25(1)(a).\n\n629.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the \"March of History\" was indeed a challenging time for the Zimbabwean Government. This was particularly so because the Settlers/War Veterans were largely the same people who were directly responsible for overthrowing the former Government and installing the current revolutionary President, Robert Mugabe. Understandably, the Government supporting President Mugabe found itself in a predicament as to how to deal with these individuals, as they formed a long-standing part of its political support base. These Settlers/War Veterans were, however, a minority of the overall citizenry - a point that becomes potently clear when one takes into account that the proposal for the implementation of the FTLRP was rejected by the Zimbabwean people at a referendum (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 954-955).\n\n630.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 assertion, that no state of emergency or similar legislation was enacted because no such state existed at the time that the March of History commenced, is, in the Tribunal\u2019s consideration, valid evidence indicating that the March of History was not tied to a State-wide interest. The initial actions of the Settlers/War Veterans were of a scale that was not uncontrollable by the Government and the police forces. However, the Tribunal finds that the Zimbabwean Government chose to inflame the situation rather than dissolve it through legal means.\n\n631.\n\nThe Respondent has clearly demonstrated that the essential interest was to ensure the survival of the incumbent Government and its President at a political level. Such a conclusion is reasonably satisfied by the fact that the uprising was wholly instigated and performed by those who were traditionally faithful to the incumbent party. Indeed, it is not uncommon for an incumbent government to fall out of favour with the voting majority, or even their most staunch supporters, only to be replaced by a new government in an election. Accordingly, it cannot automatically follow that a threat to the existence of a political party is a threat to the existence of a State and therefore an essential Interest that is necessary to protect at all costs. The Respondent has failed to demonstrate how this threat to the survival of the Incumbent party at a political level was a threat to the State itself.\n\n632.\n\nAccordingly, it must follow that there was no threat demonstrated by the Settlers/War Veterans to an essential Interest of the State that would satisfy the essential Interest requirement in ILC Article 25(1)(a).\n\nb) A Grave and Imminent Peril\n-----------------------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the mass uprising of millions of people was an \"irresistible force... beyond the control of the State\" (see Resp. Skel., para. 116), openly challenging the Zimbabwean Government and its President (see *ibid* *.,* para. 109). The Respondent highlights that the International response to its decision to pursue a policy of \"moderation and reconciliation\" in Implementing the FTLRP was wholly negative (see Rejoinder, para. 97). This additional factor resulted in greater distress and crisis in Zimbabwe\u2019s economic, political and social sectors (see *ibid.,* para. 910), analogous to that suffered by the Argentine Republic in *LG&E.* The Tribunal is aware that the necessity judgments in *LG&E, Enron* and *Sempra Energy International v. The Argentine Republic*(see ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, CLEX-230 ***(\"Sempra\")***\u00a0were subsequently annulled, as well as parts of the necessity award in *CMS,* and so the discussions on necessity in relation to these cases are meant solely to address the Parties\u2019 discussions of these cases.\n\n634.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Zimbabwe has failed to submit evidence proving that the Settlers/War Veterans posed a threat sufficient to trigger such a peril or threat to the existence of the State and maintenance of public order (see Cl. Skel., para. 154). The Claimants Identify statements made by the Zimbabwean police force to the effect that they were capable of \"dealing with the so-called \u2018mass-movements\u2019 and that the State was not facing a \u2018bloody conflagration\u2019\" (see *ibid.)* *.* Likewise, and drawing from the case of *Commissioner of Police v. Commercial Farmers\u2019 Union*(see 2000 (1) ZLR 503 (H) - High Court, Harare, p. 515, CLEX-75), the Claimants note that there was no evidence supplied by Zimbabwe to support the claimed millions of occupiers, with the police putting the figure at closer to 58,000 persons (see Cl. Skel., para. 154).\n\n635.\n\nConsequently, the Claimants argue that Zimbabwe had failed to prove the claimed crisis in the political and social sectors and that, prior to the FTLRP, there had been no threat of an economic crisis. Accordingly, there could not have been an economic threat prior to the FTLRP, let alone one that could threaten the existence of the State or maintenance of public order. The Claimants aver that the FTLRP and affiliated policy decisions taken by the Government of Zimbabwe contributed to Zimbabwe\u2019s economic crisis (see *ibid* *.).*\n\n636.\n\nThe evidence presented demonstrates that the initial land occupations by the Settlers/War Veterans did not constitute a threat to the survival of the State, but rather a threat solely to the incumbent political party which could have been brought under control by the police. As to the economic threat, the Tribunal agrees there is little doubt that the Zimbabwean economy was in a more robust state prior to the March of History and that the economy entered an increasingly sharp decline in stability as the decade drew on. However, any alleged imminent peril to the State only materialized after the implementation of the FTLRP and its associated policies, which was the State\u2019s own response to the initial land occupations by the Settlers/War Veterans. The Respondent admits that this response was poorly received internationally, and had a detrimental impact on the State\u2019s ability to obtain foreign direct investment. In view of the Respondent\u2019s initial response, a necessity plea would ultimately fail because of Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles.\n\n637.\n\nThe Respondent has also failed to adduce evidence that the FTLRP was a policy initiative implemented for the long-term economic interests of the State. The Respondent\u2019s evidence, that the policy was implemented in response to the demands of the occupying Settlers/War Veterans who were \"attacking\" the President (see Resp. Skel., para. 87), only serves to emphasize the point that the FTLRP was implemented to appease disgruntled political supporters. This becomes even clearer when one takes into account that the FTLRP had the exact opposite effect on the economy to that which was necessary to avoid its collapse. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not satisfied the \"grave and imminent peril\" requirement.\n\nc) The Only Way\n---------------\n\n638.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Respondent argues that humanitarian considerations must be accounted for in the determination of whether an alternative course of action was available (see Resp. Skel., para. 118, citing the *Rainbow Warrior case (New Zealand v. France)* (Arbitral Tribunal) (1990) 82 Int\u2019l L. Rep. 499). Insofar as its options to respond to the March of History are concerned, the Respondent argues that there was no other way than the FTLRP (and its associated policy measures) to save lives and safeguard the \"ongoingness\" of the State (see *ibid* *.,* paras. 118, 122-132). The Respondent appears to reach this conclusion by relying on its previous attempts to reason with the \"squatters\" to no avail, as well as its analysis of the situation as extremely volatile, akin to a fire which was \"symbolic of the invasions\", which would have resulted in the loss of many other lives if the Respondent had pursued \"Rhodesian style security\", as it asserts is being argued by the Claimants (see Rebutter, para. 324; *ibid* *.,* para. 113). Accordingly, the Respondent argues that, by not ordering its police to fire on the land occupiers, it made a \"correct\" decision (see Resp. Skel., para. 94). The Respondent contends that it attempted to reason with the \"squatters\" to no avail (see *ibid.* *,* para. 113).\n\n639.\n\nAs evidence that other means had been attempted, the Respondent states that, in March and April 2000, it sent police to evict occupiers, while in August the Lands Minister, John Nkomo, declared to the occupiers that their occupation had to cease, and passed legislation that rendered the occupations Illegal (see *ibid* *.,* para. 87). However, the Respondent notes that the \"mob\" was \"unpredictable and dangerous\" (see Rejoinder, paras. 374-375), the occupiers would \"brandish their machetes and axes whenever they saw any white people\" and negotiations were \"almost always Impossible as the Invaders were usually too high on mbanje, or else too drunk to listen to reason\" (see *ibid* *.).* Owing to the absence of Government resistance the occupations continued, with 42% of all occupations occurring between 2001 and 2002 (see Resp. Skel., para. 87). Prince Machaya also notes at para. 3 of his first Witness Statement that when the police:\n\n[W]ent on the ground to try and stop the Invasions and as events continued unfolding, it became obvious that the situation had become volatile and the problem monumental as more and more landless Zimbabweans took up land. [The land Invaders] were no longer Impressed by the law which they perceived to be the continuation of colonial times and which was stopping them from getting land.\n\n640.\n\nThe Respondent has also posited its analysis as a riotous mob, using the metaphor of an uncontrollable fire to Indicate that the police were unable to tame such a force (see Rebutter, paras. 320-326). Along with emphasizing the overwhelming scale of the land occupier movement, the Respondent contends that there were political and racial overtones, adding another element of unpredictability, which It describes as being akin to a \"powder keg\" (see *ibid.* *,* para. 454). Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the FTLRP was the only option available because it was demanded by the occupying Settlers/War Veterans, and therefore the only non-violent means available to quell unrest (see Resp. Skel., para. 121).\n\n641.\n\nThe Claimants, as the Tribunal summarized above, draw evidence from the case of *Commissioner of Police v. CFU* in which the Zimbabwean High Court determined that the police force was capable of stopping the land Invasions but seemed to have been stymied by the Executive (see Cl. Skel., para. 155). The Claimants have noted that \"the Police are an effective force... and among their number are units that specialize incivil dlstrlbuances, including riots\" (see Mem., para. 675; Gadzikwa I, para. 15; Heinrich I, paras. 106, 584). The Claimants also assert that the occupation movement was political and racial innature and so no action was taken due to the police force\u2019s bias; the police force was essentially directly and Indirectly a supporter of ZANU-PF (see Laurie I, para. 20). While there were different accounts between witnesses on both sides, owing to the political nature of the conflict, ultimately the Claimants\u2019 contention was that the Respondent \"instructed, directed and controlled the invasions\" (see Mem., para. 693). The Claimants further submit that the FTLRP was not a policy initiative supported by the masses, but rather was the direct result of instigation by the Government (see Cl. Skel., para. 155). Additionally, the Claimants submit that the reason for the international community\u2019s failure to endorse the FTLRP and accompanying policies was because it had wanted to work with Zimbabwe to ensure orderly land reform (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n642.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties are in agreement that the occupation movement was political and racial in nature; the Parties then diverge in their approach towards such a movement. The Respondent\u2019s contention that political and racial movements should not be addressed because of their volatile nature cannot be accepted. The purpose of any State, and particularly its police force, is to maintain order in spite of such instabilities rather than stepping back and allowing the citizenry to devolve into anarchy. The Tribunal further notes that there seemed to be a promotion of such racial and political overtones, instead of an attempt to subdue them, with Minister Mutasa analogising the current police force\u2019s refusal to aid its white farmers to the British police force's refusal to aid the Zimbabweans in 1968 (see Mutasa I, paras. 11-14). Such retributive justice indicates unjustified discrimination, but this element will be discussed in greater depth below. As the Tribunal cannot accept a State's refusal to diffuse a situation by virtue of its characterisation as political and/or racial in nature, whether the FTLRP was the only way to address the occupation movement will turn on the facts.\n\n643.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it had sent the police force to try and stop the Invasions, but the Tribunal finds that these assertions are largely unsubstantiated. Prince Machaya's statement is not attested by any facts, and subsequently he seems to contradict the same assertion by acknowledging that the Zimbabwean courts were not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s position that the police force was incapable of restoring order (see Machaya I, para. 5). The Respondent also relies on a publication, *Zimbabwe Takes Back its Land,* to indicate that efforts to stabilise the situation were attempted in 2000, but fails to mention that the same page referenced also stated that \"the state did not have a clear or consistent policy... and the nature of the issue was determined more significantly by individual politicians in particular areas\" (see R-72, p. 72). The Claimants' witness, Professor Chan, has also indicated that the response to the occupation movement was not unified because of political divisions, with Mr. Dumiso Dabengwa being \"reluctant to endorse the land invasions in the first instance and, in fact, want[ing] them stopped\" (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 951 -952). During this period of political uncertainty and argument between the factions, there were clearly alternatives mooted, which were subsequently ignored when the incumbent party, ZANU-PF, reestalished itself politically.\n\n644.\n\nIn addition to these political alternatives, the Tribunal finds that there were alternative means provided by the Zimbabwean courts, as well as the international community, that the Respondent clearly Ignored. The High Court, with the advantage of specific Information regarding the police force's capabilities and the numbers of farm Invaders, rejected the police force's contentions that there were Insufficient resources to combat such Invasions. Sympathetic to the police force\u2019s dependence on resources provided by the Executive, the High Court had Issued a consent order, comprising multiple options, with \"the underlying perception... that the police force would, to the best of its ability and with the resources available to It, act to terminate the farm Invasions... [but] what is, however, glaringly apparent is that the [police force] has not acted at al\"\" (see *Commissioner of Police v. CFU,* 2000 (i) ZLR 503, April 2000, CLEX-75, p. 514). The High Court further noted that \"farm Invasions are not a new phenomenon in Zimbabwe. They have occurred in the past and when the police, with the support of the Executive have acted, the Invasions have been brought to an end\" (see *ibid* *.,* p. 518). Finally, the Tribunal also notes that alternatives were provided by the International community. The British, In 2000, were willing to release 36 million pounds sterling to Zimbabwe on the condition that \"farm occupations and violence were to end first\", but the Respondent \"Insisted on financial assistance without any conditionality\" (see Zimbabwe 2003 - Report of the Presidential Land Review Committee on the Implementation of the Fast Track Land Reform Programme 2000-2002, p. 16, C-221).\n\n645.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there has been a total failure on the part of the Respondent to divorce the politics of the situation from the underlying necessary duty of the State to protect its citizenry. It is the Respondent\u2019s burden to prove that it took the \"right\" or \"correct\" decision by doing nothing. The Respondent has submitted that there were no alternative means, except that of appeasement, on the one hand, or \"Rhodesian style security\" on the other (which would have resulted inbloodshed and loss of life). However, such arguments are pitched insuch broad terms as strongly to suggest that the Respondent took an Intuitive *a priori* decision of avoiding any kind of measure that would involve physical confrontation of the Invaders and did not give detailed consideration to the alternative approaches. The Respondent did not offer any evidence of the specific measures that could have been explored as possible methods of addressing the Invasions and the reasons why those specific measures were dismissed (Including, *inter alia,* any possible solutions that would have been offered by the police and armed forces, and alternatives provided by both the Zimbabwean courts77 and the International community78). The Respondent has not demonstrated that it carried out a rigorous process of assessing all possible alternatives, and it failed to take control of the situation by maintaining law and order. Instead, it Instructed the police and other officials not to act. The Tribunal finds on the evidence that the Government was assisting and encouraging the Settlers/War Veterans after the Invasions. Indeed, in the short period of \"ten days to two weeks of the beginnings of the land invasions, [President Mugabe] declared himself in favor of these land invasions\" (see Tr. Day 3, p. 968).\n\nThese would include the orders given by the Zimbabwean High Court in *Commissioner of Police v. CFU.* See Re-direct examination of Stephen Chan: Tr. Day 3, pp. 969-970).\n\nThese would include the British offer to release 36 million pounds sterling on the condition that \"farm occupations and violence were to end first\" (see Zimbabwe 2003 - Report of the Presidential Land Review Committee on the Implementation of the Fast Track Land Reform Programme 2000-2002, p. 16, C-221).\n\n646.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not satisfied the requirement that the implementation of the FTLRP was the only means available to stop the advances of the Settlers/War Veterans.\n\nd) Impairment of Other States or International Community as a Whole\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n647.\n\nIn so far as ICSID jurisprudence is concerned, the process of assessment of this condition by the tribunals in *CMS, Sempra, Enron and LG&E* was notably lacking, a criticism echoed by the subsequent annulment committees. Accordingly, a lacuna exists that needs to be filled.\n\n648.\n\nIn order to determine whether the Respondent\u2019s acts seriously impair an essential interest of other States or the international community as a whole, the Tribunal must determine whether the Respondent\u2019s acts constitute acts of racial discrimination, which are undisputedly obligations *erga omnes*(see\u00a0*Barcelona Traction,* CLEX-153).\n\n649.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 argument is fairly straightforward, claiming that the Zimbabwean Government racially discriminated against them as \"white\" farmers, singling out landowners of a similar skin colour as part of the FTLRP (see Cl. Skel., para. 156). Such activities, it is argued, were a breach of obligations *erga omnes,* as well as a peremptory norm. Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the FTLRP and its associated policies were a serious impairment of an essential interest of the international community as a whole. Furthermore, the violation of a peremptory norm is contrary to ILC Article 26 and therefore precludes Zimbabwe from invoking necessity (see *ibid* *.).*\n\n650.\n\nThe Respondent submits a number of arguments to contend that it has not engaged in racially discriminatory acts. Generally, the Respondent submits that the Lancaster House Agreement granted Zimbabwe the right to expropriate land that was not being properly used, so long as market compensation was paid to the owners (see Rejoinder, para. 253). The Tribunal agrees that this was a component of the Lancaster House Agreement and a valid exercise. As the redistribution of land was supported by the international community, the Respondent further argues that it was mutually agreed that the LRP was not about race. The Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent that land redistribution ceases to be about race by virtue of the support of the international community. Rather, the redistribution of land was considered to be a justified exercise of discrimination in favour of indigenous Zimbabweans to repair Rhodesian wrongs.\n\n651.\n\nTo this effect, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the FTLRP did not discriminate against persons based on their race (see Resp. Skel., para. 177) also fails. The Respondent submits that any racial discrimination arising from the redistribution of land is a \"given\" because of the history of the State and the way the land had been distributed during the Rhodesian era (see Rejoinder, para. 253). The Respondent argues that, if the foreign Invaders who stole the land from the African Zimbabwean people had Included a neighbouring black African State or the Japanese, the ones from whom land could have been taken today would have Included estate owners of the neighbouring black African State or Japanese estate owners and no discrimination would be Intended (see Resp. Skel., para. 177). The Tribunal rejects any such speculation attempting to minimize the racial aspect of Zimbabwe\u2019s history, as the fact remains that the estate owners were not of a neighbouring black African State or Japanese. In fact, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s attempts to downplay the significance of the historical distribution of land while also utilising It to justify the aggression displayed by the Settlers/War Veterans. The policies of land reform, both the LRP and the FTLRP, undoubtedly distinguished between persons based on race and were *prima facie* racially discriminatory.\n\n652.\n\nIt is at this juncture that the Tribunal must discuss the obligation *erga omnes* not to engage in racially discriminatory acts. As argued by the Respondent in its Rejoinder, it is accepted by the international community that situations will arise where racial discrimination is justified and will remain so for as long as is necessary. Policies that discriminate in favour of the aboriginal Inhabitants of a particular State (affirmative action) may, generally speaking, fall within this category as justifiable. These policies aid in promoting, *inter alia,* the health and well-being, general knowledge, social integration, skills, and commercial know-how of, and added employment and business opportunities for, Indigenous persons and their broader communities. Such policies may be reasonably expected to exist until the social and economic indicators of the aboriginal population are brought in line with the corresponding averages of the general population for developed States, or global averages for developing States. The Respondent has referred broadly to this general principle, citing examples such as the policies Implemented in States such as the United States of America, Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand79. In comparison, the Respondent claims that the FTLRP was also \"meant to change the system and to open the road that African Zimbabweans overtime enjoy \u2018their full rights and obligations as citizens\u2019\" (see Rejoinder para. 284). The Tribunal is not unsympathetic to national aspirations to correct colonial wrongs. Yet, while the Tribunal can agree to these principles to a broad extent, it finds the Respondent\u2019s position too extreme. Some of the examples of policies that the Respondent has cited, which provide incentives and preferential treatment to Indigenous persons, are good examples of policies that actually Intend to, and lawfully do address such inequalities. However, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s attempt to align the FTLRP with other legitimate policies that justifiably discriminate by race in order to address historical injustices.\n\nSee Rejoinder paras. 342, 498, 666 and Section 6.3.2.\n\n653.\n\nThe Tribunal does not question the legitimacy of the Lancaster House Agreement and its corresponding policy from 1979-2000 that expropriated land, with compensation, for redistribution. The discrimination in favour of indigenous Zimbabweans was necessary in order to remedy the unconscionable anti-aboriginal policies implemented throughout the Rhodesian era. For Zimbabwe\u2019s FTLRP to be considered legitimate, however, it must be established that the racial discrimination associated with this land redistribution programme was justified and necessary as well. The Respondent has submitted that the FTLRP was a means of quelling civil unrest and its inherently discriminatory policy was necessary to satisfy the demands of the Settlers/War Veterans who threatened the State during and after the March of History.\n\n654.\n\nThe Respondent blames the aggression displayed by the Settlers/War Veterans solely on the former Rhodesian Government, claiming that the land sought by the Settlers/War Veterans was originally \"stolen\" from the Zimbabwean people by the Rhodesians (see Resp. Skel., para. 83). The Respondent submits that the Claimants, as \"European farmers\", contributed to the March of History by using force to resist the change to the FTLRP and therefore prolonging Zimbabwe\u2019s situation of necessity (see *ibid.* *,* para. 110). Mr. Mutasa\u2019s testimony noted, \"in Somoh (phonetic), we have a saying that, if you go to warm yourself by the fire of a thief, you become a thief. And so the von Pezolds [the Claimants], in coming to Rhodesia, them being white became identified with the Rhodesians, and they became Rhodesians by that stroke of the pen\" (see Tr. Day 5, p 1373). The Hearing further confirmed that the objective criteria in determining which farmers would stay on their land was purely based on whether they were white (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1200-1203). Of pertinence, it should be noted that the Claimants invested in Zimbabwe in 1988, after its establishment as an independent State when it ceased being Rhodesia (see Heinrich V, para. 5).\n\n655.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined earlier in the Award that the March of History was not a threat to the State, but rather the incumbent political party (see above paras. 636-637). Furthermore, the Tribunal has found above that the FTLRP was not the only means of addressing this alleged threat (see above para. 646). The Tribunal now also finds that the aggressive nature of the Settlers/War Veterans\u2019 demands was not justified and necessary so as to give rise to a corresponding justified and necessary response by the Government. Rather, the aggression displayed by the Settlers/War Veterans was a product of prejudice and racial discrimination.\n\n656.\n\nFrom the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, a clear line can be drawn between Zimbabwe\u2019s original expropriation policy from 1979-2000, which was adequately founded and justifiable, and the FTLRP (2000 onwards), which Zimbabwe enacted in response to political pressures, rather than an underlying need to remedy the anti-indigenous land policies of the former Rhodesian Government. Zimbabwe has therefore failed to provide sufficient evidence or jurisprudence to support the proposition that the FTLRP is a justifiable form of discrimination against all foreign land owners, infavour of the Indigenous population.\n\n657.\n\nAccordingly it cannot be said that Zimbabwe has provided a legitimate reason for implementing an unjustified policy that discriminated against the landowners on the basis of their skin-color and foreign ancestral heritage, thereby contravening its obligation *erga omnes* not to engage in racial discrimination. This breach of an obligation *erga omnes* by Zimbabwe, through the implementation of the FTLRP and associated policies, was an impairment to the international community as a whole and ILC Article 25(1)(b) precludes a defence of necessity. Similarly, and on the same evidence, Zimbabwe\u2019s violation of its obligation *erga omnes* means that it has breached ILC Article 26 and is therefore precluded from raising the necessity defence in relation to any events upon which the FTLRP policy touches. As the Respondent has failed on these two points by breaching its obligations *erga omnes,* the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to determine whether the Respondent\u2019s racial discrimination was also a breach of a peremptory norm, as the Claimants submit.\n\ne) Exclusion of Necessity due to International Legal Obligations\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nUnfortunately there is limited jurisprudence available on ILC Article 25(2)(a), as the tribunals in *CMS, Sempra, Enron and LG&E* skimmed over the matter on a case-by-case factual basis and the corresponding annulment committees noted the Inadequacy of the respective tribunals\u2019 decisions. Additionally, neither Party has provided any substantive evidence insupport of their respective BIT arguments in relation to necessity. The BITs inquestion do not specifically mention or seek to withdraw from the doctrine of necessity and there is no similar provision within the BITs that is to be regarded as *lex specialis.* Accordingly, it cannot be said that the BITs preclude Zimbabwe from invoking necessity.\n\n659.\n\nHowever that may be, the Tribunal has found that the Respondent has contravened its international legal obligations *erga omnes* by engaging in racial discrimination through the Implementation of the FTLRP. Accordingly, the Respondent has failed to satisfy this requirement.\n\nf) Exclusion of Necessity due to a Contribution by the Invoking State\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n660.\n\nCiting a number of cases as authority (see\u00a0*Vivendi,* *AWG Group v. Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability, para. 263, CLEX-411; and *Impregilio S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award, 21 June 2011, para. 356, CLEX-412), the Claimants argue that the contribution must be sufficiently substantial; however, it need not be Intended or planned and may be the result of Ill-conceived policies (see Cl Skel., para. 158). Accordingly, the Claimants submit that Zimbabwe had not only contributed to a state of necessity, but had directly caused it (see *ibid* *.).* The Claimants submitted numerous pieces of evidence which indicate that, *inter alia:*\n\n(a) Settlers/War Veterans had received transport and financial aid from the Government while occupying land;\n\n(b) The police and army had contributed in the invasion process through the provision of transport assistance;\n\n(c) The police had refused to stop occupiers when requested by landowners;\n\n(d) The decision to put agricultural land in the hands of inexperienced persons, when the economy was heavily dependent upon revenue from agricultural exports, contributed to the economic decline of the State;\n\n(e) The Zimbabwean President had instructed the police and army not to attempt to evict the occupiers from the land; and\n\n(f) The Government had directly settled 59 families on the Claimants\u2019 Estates, complete with \"Offer Letters\" issued by the Government of Zimbabwe, instructing the Settlers/War Veterans to occupy the identified plots of land (see endnotes 513 to 518 of Cl. Skel generally, and para. 158, see also Tr. Day 5, p. 1415).\n\n661.\n\nThe Respondent concedes that the March of History was owing in part to a failure of the Government to support the Settlers/War Veterans\u2019 \"land-hungriness\" by not implementing the FTLRP earlier (see Resp. Skel., para. 82), contending that the Government was not sympathetic to the occupations (see *ibid* *.,* para. 87). In response to the Claimants\u2019 submissions regarding the inactivity of the police, the Respondent submits that the actions of the police in standing down did not contribute to the state of necessity, but rather avoided an imminent peril (presumably a civil conflict) appearing in the long term (see *ibid* *.,* paras. 367-371).\n\n662.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimants have presented detailed evidence that demonstrates that the Government was directly assisting and supporting the Settlers/War Veterans in their pursuit of land ownership. This evidence directly contradicts the assertion by Zimbabwe that it did not sympathise with the plight of the occupying Settlers/War Veterans and had initially refrained from implementing a policy similar to the FTLRP for this reason.\n\n663.\n\nThe Respondent also blames other causes of the alleged state of emergency, such as the former landowners for failing to teach the incoming Settlers/War Veterans how to utilize the land and the \"international community\" for failing to meet their Lancaster House undertaking to fund compensation for the redistribution of land (see *ibid* *.,* para. 105). In addition, the Respondent highlights that it was shouldering a debt of over $700 million, apparently Inherited from the previous Rhodesian Government, which It argues was the result of a war Initiated by the Rhodesian Government to maintain \"white rule\" (see *ibid* *.).* Accordingly, the Respondent claims that it could not afford to purchase the land outright when the International payments ceased (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n664.\n\nAs noted above, the state of the Zimbabwean economy, as well as the level of civil order within Zimbabwe, was not a cause for immediate concern prior to the Implementation of the FTLRP. Zimbabwe\u2019s assertion that the international community is equally to blame for the State\u2019s economic downfall is unsubstantiated.\n\n665.\n\nThe international community was permitted to respond in a manner that was proportional to the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe, as stated in Chapter II of the ILC Articles (see ILC Articles 49-54). The international community (in particular those States which had been providing financial assistance in the past) was under no obligation to assist Zimbabwe, to offer financial aid or provide preferential treatment to Zimbabwean exporters when the Government had engaged in a policy that racially discriminated against persons based on their race and seized their foreign currency to bolster the State\u2019s dwindling reserves.\n\n666.\n\nThe Government could not have been completely unaware that the compulsory expropriation and redistribution of land from the seasoned and skilled farm owners to the unskilled Settlers/War Veterans would have a detrimental Impact on the State\u2019s agricultural exports. Likewise, Zimbabwe\u2019s additional argument that these landowners whose land had been expropriated contributed to the State\u2019s economic decline by falling to voluntarily provide technical assistance and training to the new Settlers/War Veterans landowners is Irrational. A landowner whose land had been expropriated by hostile Settlers/War Veterans could not have been expected to render any form of technical assistance or capacity-building education to these persons when the Government had instructed the police not to provide protection to foreign landowners.\n\n667.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Zimbabwe not only contributed to its economic decline, but was also one of the primary instigators of the situation that gave rise to the Imminent peril. Consequently, Zimbabwe has not satisfied ILC Article 25(2)(b).\n\n668.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to necessity as a defence to the above alleged treaty breaches. The argument that Zimbabwe was in a state of emergency from 16 February 2000 to 16 March 2013, so that the Government had no other reasonable choice but to expedite the LRP and expropriate land without compensation, is unconvincing. The Respondent cannot invoke ILC Article 25.\n\n**J. Remedies**\n---------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n669.\n\nThe Tribunal has found liability on the merits in favour of the Claimants, as discussed above. In particular, the Tribunal has found that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the Claimants\u2019 Zimbabwean and Residual Properties, among other property, and breached its FET, FPS and other obligations under the German and Swiss BITs. The Tribunal has also rejected the Respondent\u2019s necessity defence. Accordingly, it remains for the Tribunal to consider and determine an appropriate remedy based on the Parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n(2) Restitution\n---------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n670.\n\nThe Claimants seek declaratory relief, restitution in kind (i.e., the reinstatement of title to the Zimbabwean Properties) and compensation for losses not covered by restitution in kind. In the alternative, they seek declaratory relief and compensation.\n\n671.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Professor Williams put the following question to the Parties on the availability of restitution as a remedy, to be addressed in their Post-Hearing Briefs (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1902):\n\n... I would like some assistance on the Claimants\u2019 request for restitution in a situation where the BITs, as I understand it, do not prohibit expropriation but say-accept that the only relief there is the full compensation standard. In other words, is it permissible with these BITs to be asking for restitution when expropriation, putting It colloquially, with compensation is not, as I understand it, a breach of the Treaty? How can you in that situation be asking for restitution?\n\n672.\n\nAlthough the Claimants have not addressed this question directly, they take the position that, under customary international law, restitution is required where a peremptory norm has been breached and, because they say the evidence bears out that the aggressive phases of the LRP were a serious breach of the prohibition against racial discrimination, the Tribunal must order restitution in kind (see Cl. PHB, para. 172).\n\n673.\n\nMore broadly, the Claimants submit that restitution has primacy among the forms of reparation available at international law and that restitution is the usual form of reparation for a breach of an international obligation (see Cl. Skel., para. 186, citing *Chorzow Factory*(see\u00a0*Germany v. Poland)* (Merits) (1928) PCIJ (Series A) No. 13, CLEX-148); *Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company and California Asiatic Oil Company v. Government of the Libyan Arab Republic*  ***(\"Texaco\")***(see Award on the Merits, 1979, 53 ICR 389, CLEX-157).\n\n674.\n\nThe Claimants note that, pursuant to Article 35 of the ILC Articles, restitution is not required if it is \"materially impossible\" or if any burden it creates is disproportional to the benefit derived. Article 35 of the ILC Articles provides as follows:\n\nA state responsible for an Internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:\n\na. Is not materially Impossible; and\n\nb. does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution Instead of compensation.\n\n675.\n\nThe Claimants note the following circumstances relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination as to whether restitution in kind should be granted in these cases (see Cl. Skel., para. 187; Cl. PHB, para. 171):\n\n\u2022 The Claimants occupy the majority of the Estates and operate them;\n\n\u2022 Third parties do not hold legal title over the Zimbabwean Properties (see CI. Skel., para. 187);\n\n\u2022 The Respondent has acknowledged that it previously granted restitution to foreign investors whose farms were expropriated pursuant to the 2005 Constitutional Amendment (see\u00a0*Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe*  ***(\"Funnekotter\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/05/06, Award, 22 April 2009, CLEX-242).\n\n676.\n\nThe Claimants further note that, pursuant to Article 41 of the ILC Articles, if the aggressive phases of the LRP were a serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law, which in this case concerns the prohibition against racial discrimination, restitution must be ordered. Article 41 of the ILC Articles provides as follows:\n\n1. States shall cooperate to bring to an end through lawful means any serious breach within the meaning of Article 40.\n\n2. No state shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach within the meaning of Article 40, nor render aid or assistance inmaintaining that situation.\n\n3. This Article is without prejudice to the other consequences referred to in this part and to such further consequences that a breach to which this chapter applies may entail under International law.\n\n677.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the ICJ case between Israel and Palestine relating to Israel\u2019s construction of a wall in occupied Palestinian territory. In that case, the ICJ held that \"all States are under an obligation not to recognize the Illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" and an obligation \"not to render aid or assistance inmaintaining the situation created by such construction of the wall\". The ICJ found that Israel was obligated to cease work on the wall and to dismantle the structure erected, as well as to make reparation for all damage caused by the construction of the wall (see\u00a0*Construction of a Wall,* CLEX-211).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n678.\n\nAs noted above, during the Hearing, Professor Williams put the following question to the Parties on the availability of restitution as a remedy, to be addressed in their Post-Hearing Briefs (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1902):\n\n... I would like some assistance on the Claimants\u2019 request for restitution in a situation where the BITs, as I understand it, do not prohibit expropriation but say-accept that the only relief there is the full compensation standard. In other words, is it permissible with these BITs to be asking for restitution when expropriation, putting it colloquially, with compensation is not, as I understand it, a breach of the Treaty? How can you in that situation be asking for restitution?\n\n679.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent answered Professor Williams\u2019 question regarding the availability of restitution under the German and Swiss BITs by asserting that the International standard is full compensation, and therefore Increasing compensation to higher levels by the \"artifice of restitution\" is Inappropriate.\n\n680.\n\nMore broadly, the Respondent states that restitution is not possible in these circumstances and that the end of the alleged state of emergency on 16 March 2013 cannot give rise to measures that would recreate the state of emergency. The Respondent also submits that the taking was not wrongful because there was a strong public purpose Involved. The Respondent also points to a statement by the World Bank that land reform cannot be reversed, and to reports in Zimbabwe *Takes Back its Land* that Settlers/War Veterans will not allow restitution and that people on the properties will not leave. The Respondent notes somewhat rhetorically that the Claimants\u2019 demand for restitution in a legal sense is also a demand for \"restoration\" in a historical and political sense, drawing analogies to a period of restoration following the French Revolution, restoration Involving the Ku Klux Klan following the U.S. Civil War and restoration of the Tsarist regime following the Russian Revolution (see Resp. PHB, paras. 369 to 375).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\na) Overview of Restitution\n--------------------------\n\n681.\n\nDr. Borzu Sabahi\u2019s text *Compensation and Restitution in Investor-State Arbitration: Principles and Practice* (Oxford University Press, New York, 2011, CLEX-306 **(\"Sabahi\")**) offers an overview on the law regarding restitution. Dr. Sabahi states that (see *ibid.* *,* p. 61):\n\nRestitution has been recognized as the primary legal remedy in international law, because it has the potential to eliminate, legally and materially, the consequences of an unlawful act, rather than providing compensation, which is mainly a monetary substitute for restitution.\n\n682.\n\nThe principle that restitution is the primary legal remedy for international wrongs is attributed to *Factory at Chorzow.* The Permanent Court of International Justice **(\"PCIJ\")** stated: \"it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation\" (see *ibid.* *,* p. 27). Then, more fully, the PCIJ stated (see *ibid.* *,* p. 47):\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an Illegal act\u2014a principle which seems to be established by International practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals\u2014is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the Illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed If that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or. If this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which restitution inkind would bear ; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution inkind or payment inplace of It\u2014such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to International law. [emphasis added]\n\n683.\n\nWhile restitution was impossible in that case, the PCIJ\u2019s statement of law has had considerable influence. Dr. Sabahi credits *Chorzow Factory* as \"the authoritative principle governing determination of reparation due for committing wrongful acts in international law\" (see Sabahi at p. 47, CLEX-306).\n\n684.\n\nThe ILC Articles confirm restitution as the principal form of reparation in international law (see James Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2002) ***(\"Articles on State Responsibility),*** CLEX-266 to 275). ILC Article 31(1) provides that a \"responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" ILC Article 34 expands on this:\n\nFull reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination.\n\n685.\n\nILC Article 35, which is set out in full below, deals specifically with restitution:\n\nA State responsible for an Internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:\n\n(a) is not materially Impossible;\n\n(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution Instead of compensation, [emphasis added]\n\n686.\n\nRestitution restores \"the situation that existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 213, CLEX-273), also known as restitution of the *status quo ante.* However, restitution is only one form of reparation. If restitution alone falls to adequately restore a claimant to the situation it was in prior to the wrong, then other forms of reparation may also be awarded. As the commentary to the ILC Articles confirms, the reparation awarded must achieve \"re-establlshment of the situation which existed before the breach\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 211, CLEX-272). Accordingly, \"[w]lplng out all the consequences of the wrongful act may thus require some or all forms of reparation to be provided, depending on the type and extent of the Injury that has been caused\" (see *ibid* *.).*\n\n687.\n\nRestitution may take, in practice, a wide range of forms: \"this involves such conduct as the release of persons wrongly detained or the return of property wrongly seized. In other cases, restitution may be a more complex act\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 213, CLEX-273).\n\n688.\n\nGenerally, restitution is demarcated between material restitution and juridical restitution. The former usually involves the returning of property, whereas the latter involves modifying the legal situation. They are not exclusive; both may be awarded If the situation requires It.\n\n689.\n\nIn respect of the limitations provided for in ILC Article 35(a) and (b), the commentary to the ILC Articles notes that \"the phrase \u2018provided and to the extent that\u2019 makes it clear that restitution may only be partially excluded, in which case the responsible State will be obliged to make restitution to the extent that this is neither impossible nor disproportionate\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 216, CLEX-273).\n\n690.\n\nMaterial impossibility \"would apply where property to be restored has been permanently lost or destroyed, or has deteriorated to such an extent as to be valueless. On the other hand, restitution is not Impossible merely on grounds of legal or practical difficulties, even though the responsible State may have to make special efforts to overcome these\" (see *ibid* *.).* Internal laws, per ILC Article 32, do not justify the failure to provide reparation; obstacles in administration or politics are also insufficient. Proportionality is such that restitution is only barred If \"there is a grave dlsproportionality\" between the remedy awarded and the relevant breach (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 217, CLEX-273).\n\n691.\n\nAlthough this dispute arises between an investor and a State, it is apparent that the ILC Articles will be of considerable guidance to this Tribunal.\n\n692.\n\nWith this broad background, the Tribunal turns now to restitution in respect of investment treaties.\n\nb) Restitution and Investment Treaties\n--------------------------------------\n\n693.\n\nDr. Sabahi\u2019s comments provide a suitable introduction. He notes that \"[m]odern investment treaties, apart from codifying how the compensation due for a lawful expropriation should be computed, do not codify rules relating to how restitution should be awarded\" (see\u00a0*Sabahi* at p. 62, CLEX-306). He then states that (see *ibid* *.,* p. 63):\n\nThe power of an arbitral tribunal to award restitution is derived from its jurisdiction to decide a case. The fact that some jurisdictional Instruments specifically grant the power to award restitution does not detract from the customary nature of this power. The scope of such powers, however, may be circumscribed in the same Instruments that grant the jurisdiction or in other instruments, as the parties may agree.\n\n694.\n\nThe text of the ICSID Convention does not state with specificity whether ICSID tribunals may only award pecuniary remedies, or whether material restitution is also envisioned. However, a view into the Convention\u2019s drafting history confirms that \"an award could well order the performance or non performance of certain acts\" (see\u00a0*History of the ICSID Convention,* Vol. II, p. 991), which may include \"restitution of seized property\" (see Christoph Schreuer, \"Non-Pecuniary Remedies in ICSID Arbitration\" (2004) 20 Arb. Int\u2019l 325 at pp. 325, 332, CLEX-280).\n\n695.\n\nIndeed, ICSID tribunals are amongst the ranks of investment tribunals that have affirmed their jurisdiction to award non-pecuniary remedies. In *Enron,* it was stated that (see\u00a0*Enron,* para. 79, CLEX-207):\n\nAn examination of the powers of international courts and tribunals to order measures concerning performance or injunction and of the ample practice that is available in this respect, leaves this Tribunal in no doubt about the fact that these powers are indeed available.\n\n696.\n\nThe *Enron* tribunal soon after also said (see *ibid* *.,* para. 81):\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that, in addition to declaratory powers, it has the power to order measures involving performance of injunction of certain acts.\n\n697.\n\nAgain, in *loan Micula,* the tribunal stated (see\u00a0*loan Micula,* para. 166, CLEX-237):\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, a tribunal has the power to order pecuniary or non-pecuniary remedies, including restitution, i.e., re-establishing the situation which existed before a wrongful act was committed. As Respondent itself admits, restitution is, in theory, a remedy that is available under the ICSID Convention. That admission essentially disposes of the objection as an objection to jurisdiction and admissibility. The fact that restitution is a rarely ordered remedy is not relevant at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n698.\n\nNevertheless, Dr. Sabahi indicates that \"restitution in international investment law, particularly in modern practice, is not awarded often\" (see Sabahi, p. 61, CLEX-306).\n\n699.\n\nWhile not awarded often, this seems to be driven mostly by pragmatic concerns. It is rare that the property indispute can be returned because of damage. Further, parties often prefer the simplicity of a monetary award, also for enforcement purposes.\n\n700.\n\nThe main conclusion to be drawn from the above analysis is that it is beyond doubt that non-pecunlary remedies, including restitution, can be awarded in ICSID Convention arbitrations under investment treaties.\n\nc) Examples of Material Restitution\n-----------------------------------\n\n701.\n\nA number of examples can be cited in which International courts or tribunals have recognised or awarded restitution (see Sabahi. pp. 65-71, CLEX-306).\n\n702.\n\nIn *Texaco,* Professor Dupuy sat as sole arbitrator. Professor Dupuy extensively analysed the International law on restitution before concluding (see\u00a0*Texaco,* para. 100, CLEX-157):\n\n... [T]his Tribunal must hold that restitutio in integrum is, both under the principles of Libyan law and under the principles of international law, the normal sanction for non-performance of contractual obligations and that it is inapplicable only to the extent that restoration of the status quo ante is impossible.\n\n703.\n\nProfessor Dupuy allowed the Libyan Government five months to fully perform its obligations under the Deeds of Concession, breached when the Government unlawfully nationalised the Claimants\u2019 properties, rights and assets. This amounted to an award of restitution.\n\n704.\n\nIn *Construction of a Wall,* the ICJ concluded that (see\u00a0*Construction of a Wall,* para. 153, CLEX-211):\n\nIsrael is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage suffered.\n\n705.\n\nTwo other examples discussed by Professor Dupuy in *Texaco* may be briefly stated. In *Republic of El Salvador v. Republic of Nicaragua*(see discussion in *Texaco,* para. 99, CLEX-157), it was ordered that \"the Government of Nicaragua is *under the obligation -* availing itself of all possible means provided by international law - to reestablish and maintain the legal status that existed prior\" [emphasis inoriginal] to the relevant acts of the Government (see *ibid.)* *.* in the case concerning *Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand)*(see 1962 ICJ 6, Judgment, CLEX-152) the order made was that (see *ibid* *,* p. 35):\n\nThailand is under an obligation to restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia\u2019s fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities.\n\n706.\n\nGiven that little evidence was presented particularising the property taken, the Court noted that it could \"only give a finding of principle in favour of Cambodia, without relating it to any particular objects\" (see *ibid* *.,* p. 34).\n\n707.\n\nFinally of note is *Funnekotter,* a case particularly relevant to this Tribunal\u2019s analysis. In *Funnekotter,* the claimant did not pursue restitution but, in the early stages of the proceedings, the respondent -Zimbabwe - submitted that it was \"in position to restore the claimants to their properties and has already restored other owners of bilaterally protected investments to their properties\", noting that \"restitution is practicable and possible\" (see\u00a0*Funnekotter,* para. 68, CLEX-242). Four examples of restitution were mentioned by Zimbabwe. However, the respondent later withdrew its willingness to offer restitution. Accordingly, the Tribunal did not have to concern itself with the granting of restitution in that case.\n\nd) Application to the Claimants\n-------------------------------\n\n708.\n\nThis section considers whether the Tribunal should award restitution in the present case in the light of the relevant BITs and the evidence adduced by the Parties.\n\ni) The Relevant Legal Framework\n-------------------------------\n\n709.\n\nAs mentioned, ICSID tribunals have jurisdiction to award restitution, unless otherwise agreed (for example, where the BIT prohibits it). In this dispute, neither BIT prohibits the Tribunal from ordering restitution.\n\n710.\n\nFirst, the German BIT does not prohibit restitution. If anything, it contemplates it in at least one limited respect. Article 4(2) provides for expropriation \"for a public purpose and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\" Article 4(3), however, entitles those protected by this Treaty:\n\n... [W]hose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting party owing to war or armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency or revolt... treatment no less favourable by such other Contracting Party than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third state, whichever is the more favourable, as regards restitution. Indemnification, compensation or other valuable consideration. [emphasis added]\n\n711.\n\nFurther, Article 11 (2), concerning investment disputes between a State and an investor, entitles the arbitral tribunal to reach its decision by considering, amongst other things, \"such rules of general international law as may be applicable\". This wording supports the award of restitution as recognised by customary International law.\n\n712.\n\nAccordingly, nothing in this BIT prevents an award of restitution.\n\n713.\n\nSecondly, the substance of the Swiss BIT mirrors that of the German BIT. The above comments therefore apply here. Article 6(1) recognises compensation for expropriation, while Article 7(1), like Article 4(3) of the German BIT, goes further inrecognising the possibility for restitution.\n\n714.\n\nArticle 7(1) concerns compensation for losses \"owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, Insurrection or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party\". That article goes on to say that an investor who suffers losses from \"requisitioning of their property\" by the other State\u2019s \"forces or authorities\" \"shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation.\" This Article Indicates that the BIT anticipates restitution as a ground for relief in the event of a dispute.\n\n715.\n\nFinally, Article 10(3) of the Swiss BIT also allows a tribunal to determine the dispute, amongst other things, based on \"such rules of International law as may be applicable\".\n\n716.\n\nAs a result, restitution is not prohibited under the Swiss BIT either.\n\n717.\n\nIn light of the language of the two BITs, this Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to award restitution, if appropriate.\n\nii) Basis for Restitution\n-------------------------\n\n718.\n\nThere appear to be two grounds under which the Claimants seek restitution. In the Claimants\u2019 Memorial they state:\n\n1618. The matters stated in paras 1583 to 1617 above constitute sufficient grounds for the tribunal to order restitution in relation to the Zimbabwean Properties.\n\n1619. However, Professor Sarooshi in his expert witness statement opines that there is a further ground for restitution. This further ground is the fact that the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme as applied to the Claimants is a \"serious breach\" by the Respondent of a peremptory norm of general international law, namely the prohibition against racial discrimination...\n\n719.\n\nThe \"sufficient grounds\" referred to in paragraphs 1583 to 1617 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial involve unlawful expropriation without compensation of the Zimbabwean Properties. This is the first stated ground for restitution. The second ground is breach of a peremptory norm.\n\n720.\n\nThis is consistent with the Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief. The Claimants affirm that the \"Respondent must make full reparation which will wipe out all of the consequences of its breaches of the BITs, customary international law and Zimbabwean law\" (see Cl. PHB, para. 169).\n\n721.\n\nHowever, an important point of distinction between these grounds is the Claimants\u2019 argument that the breach of peremptory norm, if it succeeds, requires that restitution be ordered as a mandatory requirement (see Cl. PHB, para. 172).\n\n722.\n\nNevertheless, it would seem sensible that either breach could be a ground for restitution. Breach of the BIT would be an internationally wrongful act within Article 2 of the ILC Articles as a \"breach of an international obligation\", which can include treaty obligations (see Crawford, *Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 83, CLEX-266). Breach of a peremptory norm could also justify restitution.\n\niii) Whether Restitution Should Be Awarded\n------------------------------------------\n\n723.\n\nIf the Tribunal finds that there has been a breach of a BIT or a peremptory norm, then *prima facie* it seems that the Claimants are entitled to restitution unless one of the \"defences\" in Article 35 of the ILC Articles applies.\n\n724.\n\nIn the following section, therefore, the Tribunal first considers the two defences to restitution, namely, material impossibility and disproportionality. Secondly, the Tribunal considers whether a breach of a peremptory norm requires restitution irrespective of those defences.\n\niv) Material Impossibility\n--------------------------\n\n725.\n\nAs noted, material impossibility usually arises in a situation where property is permanently destroyed or lost. The standard is high: the commentary to Article 35 of the ILC Articles provides that \"restitution is not impossible merely on grounds of legal or practical difficulties, even though the responsible State may have to make special efforts to overcome these\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* CLEX-385, p. 98). Further, Article 32 of the ILC Articles prohibits a state from relying on its internal laws to justify non-compliance with its international obligations.\n\n726.\n\nExamples where the material impossibility defence has been applied successfully are rare, given that most parties are likely to pursue monetary compensation if it appears that restitution is impossible (see *ibid* *,* p. 97). The decision in *Occidental Petroleum Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador* recognised that material impossibility may arise in circumstances where performance is plainly legally impossible, though it did so in a somewhat different context. There, the Tribunal stated that (see\u00a0*Occidental Petroleum Corporation v Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Provisional Measures (ICSID Case No ARB/06/11), para. 79, CLEX-228):\n\nIt is well established that where a State has, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, put an end to a contract or a license, or any other foreign investor\u2019s entitlement, specific performance must be deemed legally impossible.\n\n727.\n\nViewed through this lens, the Tribunal finds that restitution is not materially impossible in the present case.\n\n728.\n\nFirst, restitution here essentially requires reinstatement - or reissuing - of title to the Zimbabwean Properties acquired by the Government In 2005 (see Cl. Corrected Request for Relief, para. 8.12.1). This is clearly not legally impossible - it simply requires an administrative act on the part of the Government. Especially relevant here is the fact that the Claimants remain insubstantial occupation of most of their properties (see Heinrich I, paras. 596, 683 and Appendix I - Heinrich estimates that, across the three Estates, Settlers/War Veterans occupy between 16 to 41% of the land area). Thus if the Claimants had legal title restored, it would in fact serve to legitimise the *de facto* position in which the Claimants remain (at least in respect of the land they occupy; not all land is occupied). Given that there is no legal impossibility in reissuing legal title to the Properties (and the Respondent cannot rely on its own internal laws to prevent restitution in any case), the *Occidental Petroleum* decision mentioned above is clearly distinguishable.\n\n729.\n\nSecond, although the Claimants\u2019 Estates have suffered property damage, there is no indication that this is irreparable or that the Claimants are unwilling to restore the land to its original position. Indeed, if restitution were granted, then the Claimants could pursue their legal rights against other occupiers of the land via the domestic courts in trespass or other causes of action. It is notable that, as discussed above, the Respondent has acknowledged in the context of the *Funnekotter* case that it has previously restored the owners of other bilaterally protected investments to their properties.\n\n730.\n\nFinally, the rights of the third parties currently resident on the land - that is, the Settlers/War Veterans - are fragile at best. Not all of those who are on the land appear to have been given Offer Letters (see e.g. Tr. Day 4, p. 1258 - Tsvakwi: \"... the properties were acquired In 2005, and there are some people with Offer Letters, but there were some people who went and occupied the properties\"). Even those occupiers who have received Offer Letters from the Government have not gained legal title. There is uncertainty even now as to who is entitled to what portions of the expropriated land (see e.g., Tr. Day 3, p. 965 - Chan: \"So, we are in a position of some inchoate nature whereby we do not know exactly who owns what...\"). It appears from the evidence that the Settlers/War Veterans may in any event be less concerned about legal ownership and more worried to protect the usage they have acquired through occupation (see e.g., Tr. Day 5, p. 1372 - Mutasa: \"And, indeed, it is that usage which is important to us and not the usage that people like yourself and Mr. von Pezold are thinking of lining individual pockets and depriving all other people of their livelihood and their means of livelihood\").\n\n731.\n\nThis leads the Tribunal to the following conclusion: there is no material impossibility in returning the land. Legal title simply needs to be issued. Indeed, Zimbabwe has admitted to four occasions in the past where it has provided restitution to foreign investors. However, of most concern is the partial occupation of the Claimants\u2019 lands and the consequences of restoring title. The Respondent principally seems to argue material impossibility because the LRP cannot be reversed and the Settlers/War Veterans will not allow \"their\" land to betaken (see Resp. Skel., paras. 235-238). The Respondent says restitution \"would trigger instability, insecurity and possible breach of peace by those who are settled and believe land reform is moving the country forward\" (see CM, para. 166).\n\n732.\n\nWhile the Tribunal does not consider this to support material impossibility, the possibility of some disturbance should not be overlooked. Also, occupation on the Claimants\u2019 Properties has involved the planting of some subsistence crops and the construction of some buildings. If the Claimants sought to exercise their rights by having these removed, this may involve conflict, which is, realistically, a matter for the police and local authorities. The Tribunal considers that it must operate on the assumption that there is sufficient rule of law to enable the Respondent to carry out whatever award the Tribunal decides upon, including an award of restitution. Indeed, the Tribunal has found no compelling evidence otherwise. In this respect, the Tribunal has had occasion to call upon the Respondent for assistance and the Respondent has always complied. The Tribunal bases itself on several Procedural Orders discussed above in Section III.E of this Award and attached as Annexes to the present Award, where the Respondent and its organs, including the police, have complied with the Tribunal\u2019s directions80.\n\nSee above paras. 42-47.\n\n733.\n\nIn any event, the possibility of conflict would not prevent restitution in this case as it does not constitute material impossibility. Moreover, chaos does not appear to have ensued on the four occasions where Zimbabwe has provided for restitution in the past (see Mem., para. 1615; *Funnekotter,* para. 82, CLEX-242).\n\nv) Disproportionality\n---------------------\n\n734.\n\nThis head ensures that restitution is not awarded when it involves \"a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* Article 35, CLEX-385).\n\n735.\n\nThe answer, to this Tribunal, is plain. It is not disproportionate to award title to lands unlawfully expropriated. This decision is limited to the Claimants and so will not have systemic Influence across Zimbabwe. This does not involve any wide scale juridical restitution or attack on Zimbabwe\u2019s sovereignty. In the light of compensation and restitution anticipated by the relevant BITs, the Tribunal does not consider that restitution would be disproportional.\n\nvi) Peremptory Norm\n-------------------\n\n736.\n\nThe Claimants submit that restitution has a different flavour when applied in respect of a peremptory norm. The Claimants have relied on an opinion by Professor Sarooshi of Oxford University in support of this claim (C-38). Practically, this submission seeks to avoid any defences to restitution.\n\n737.\n\nProfessor Sarooshi relies upon Articles 34, 35, 40 and 41 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and its corresponding commentary. ILC Articles 34 and 35 referto the forms of reparation available, noting the primacy of restitution, as well as the ability to use these various forms of reparation, singly or incombination, in orderto ensure full reparation. ILC Articles 40 and 41 refer, respectively, to international responsibility and the corresponding obligations attached to a breach of a peremptory norm.\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the prohibition of racial discrimination is an obligation *erga omnes* as confirmed by the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction* (Second Phase, Judgment, CLEX-153). Yet it is still arguable as to whether this obligation has evolved to the level of *jus cogens* due to the many exceptions to and permissible derogations from It. Forms of differentiation are allowed if they are objectively justifiable. This is evident from the *International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* and from the commentary to the US Restatement in Section 712, which states that \"classifications, even If based on nationality, that are rationally related to the state\u2019s security or economic policies might not be unreasonable\". As discussed above at paras. 648-657, the Tribunal has found that the Respondent had engaged in racially discriminatory acts through the implementation of the FTLRP and its associated policies. The Tribunal reiterates its earlier finding that it is unnecessary in this case to determine whether racial discrimination is also a peremptory norm. Indeed, based on well accepted international law principles of reparation alone, as discussed below, the Tribunal finds that the primary relief claimed by the Claimants (I.e. restitution) is the most appropriate relief to award.\n\n(e) Restitution and the effect on third parties\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n739.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants, inseeking restitution of the *status quo ante* with respect to the expropriated Zimbabwean Properties, ask for legal title to be restored in the name of the Zimbabwean Companies. The Zimbabwean Companies, as already noted, are not parties to this arbitration. However, the Tribunal has already found that because the von Pezold Claimants exercise legal and factual control over the Zimbabwean Companies, their rights and interests are aligned insofar as their claims for the underlying assets are concerned. The Tribunal thus finds that it would be appropriate for restitution of legal title to the Zimbabwean Properties, if ordered, to be rendered to the respective Zimbabwean Companies which formerly held that title.\n\n740.\n\nRestitution to the Zimbabwean Companies will ensure that the von Pezold Claimants (in respect of both the indirect expropriation of their shareholding in the Zimbabwean Companies and their right to claim for the direct expropriation of the underlying assets: see above paras. 317-326) are made whole (see\u00a0*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* CLEX-149). Although it is not necessary to determine the point in light of the circumstances of control exercised by the von Pezold Claimants over the Zimbabwean Companies in the present case, the Tribunal considers that the von Pezold Claimants would be entitled in any event to appoint a third-party nominee to receive property on their behalf- especially if doing so had the effect of restoring the previously-prevailing situation. There is nothing in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility which would preclude such an approach (indeed, see\u00a0*James Crawford, Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 213, CLEX-273: \"[t]he term \u2018restitution\u2019 in article 35 thus has a broad meaning, encompassing any action that needs to be taken by the responsible State to restore the situation resulting from its internationally wrongful act.\")\n\n741.\n\nAlthough the issue has never been raised directly by the Parties, the Tribunal believes it is a further relevant consideration that, in ordering restitution in favour of the Zimbabwean Companies, the Tribunal will affect to some extent the interests of those third parties who also hold shares, directly or indirectly, in the Makandi and Border Companies. Indeed, third-party shareholders stand to derive benefit from the Tribunal\u2019s grant of restitution, because the value of their shareholdings in the Makandi and Border Companies will likely be increased by restoration of the Zimbabwean Properties belonging to those companies.\n\n742.\n\nTo the extent, however, that third-party shareholders will benefit from a grant of restitution, that is merely reflective of the fact that their respective minority shareholdings have endured the same erosion of value as the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 controlling participation in the Zimbabwean Companies, and that the Tribunal\u2019s order of restitution will restore the situation prevailing but for the Respondent\u2019s breaches of international law. The effect on shareholder value (including the von Pezolds\u2019 shareholding) will be the same, for instance, whether restitution of the Border Properties to the Border Companies is enforced through the Tribunal\u2019s remedial jurisdiction over the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 claims or the Border Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n743.\n\nIt is trite to say that the Tribunal has a broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate and fair remedy to do justice in the circumstances. In all the present circumstances, the Tribunal considers that a compelling case for restitution has been made out, bearing in mind the severity of the breaches of international law which have taken place and the paramount principle of providing full reparation to wipe out all consequences of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful acts81.\n\nAs discussed below, the von Pezold Claimants (and the Border Claimants) have also sought compensation for their losses in respect of the Forrester, Makandi and Border Estates - either to provide reparation in the event that the Respondent does not provide restitution, or else to make up the \"Restitution Shortfalls\" between the value of the Estates on a \"but for\" and \"as is\" value. The above discussion about the effect of restitution on third parties does not arise in respect of these claimed compensatory sums, because those sums will be awarded directly to the von Pezold Claimants and have been calculated taking into account the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 proportionate shareholdings in the Makandi and Border Estates (see e.g. Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, Schedule 2.2 (Makandi) and para. 2.04.9 (Border), Corrected CE-7).\n\n(f) Conclusion\n--------------\n\n744.\n\nInsummary, the Tribunal finds that restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties expropriated In 2005, including attached Water Permits, should be ordered in favor of the Claimants. While this Section of the Award has focused on restitution in kind, the Tribunal considers that it is further necessary to award compensation for the losses incurred by the Claimants due to, *inter alia,* land damage and losses to productivity. This is necessary to achieve full reparation and is addressed below.\n\n(3) Compensation\n----------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n745.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in addition to restitution, compensation must also be ordered to cover losses sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind and that, to ensure an effective remedy, in the alternative, compensation must be ordered to be payable in the event restitution in kind is not effected by the Respondent within sixty days (see Cl. PHB, para. 172).\n\n746.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 4(2) of the German BIT and Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT require that compensation for a lawful expropriation be \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\". The German BIT in particular provides that such compensation \"shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment\". The Swiss BIT states that such compensation \"shall amount to the real value of the investment expropriated\". According to the Claimants, the effect of these provisions is that compensation must indemnify the Claimants to a level corresponding to the fair market value of the investments expropriated (see Cl. Skel., para. 190, citing *Vivendi,* CLEX-315; *Funnekotter,* CLEX-242; *The World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment 1992,* CLEX-118; and the Danish BIT, CLEX-7).\n\n747.\n\nThe Claimants note that the appropriate date for valuation under this standard is the earlier of: (i) the date immediately before it became publicly known that the Investment had been expropriated; and (ii) the date immediately before it became publicly known that the investment would be expropriated. For most of the expropriations, including those relating to the Zimbabwean Properties and the Zimbabwean Company Shares, the Claimants identify this date as 13 September 2005. The Claimants note that the Zimbabwean Constitution and the *Land Acquisition Act* derogate from the applicable international standard for compensation as they do not provide for full reparation under Zimbabwean law. The Claimants note in particular that the *Land Acquisition Act,* in regard to investors not protected by treaties, merely requires that compensation for agricultural land acquired for resettlement be limited to improvements to the land and does not provide for compensation for the value of the lost land itself. The Claimants take the position that Section 16(9)(b) of the Zimbabwean Constitution enacted in 1996 prevents the application of Zimbabwean law to foreign investors to the extent it derogates from the property and compensation rights granted to foreign investors under treaties. The Claimants note that the Parties disagree as to the effect of Section 16(9)(b) of the Zimbabewean Constitution; however, with or without its application, the Claimants submit that the international standard is the applicable one under the treaties (see Cl. PHB, paras. 173 to 174).\n\n748.\n\nThe Claimants note that the standard of compensation for an unlawful expropriation is governed by customary international law. The Claimants say the customary international law standard requires compensation to \"wipe out all the consequences\" of the State\u2019s wrongful act (see Cl. Skel., para. 191, citing *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* CLEX-148; ILC Articles 31 and 36(1)). The Claimants take the position that this is done by assessing compensation on the basis of the fair market value of the investment rights lost as at a date elected by the Claimants between, on the one hand, the earlier of the date immediately prior to the breach or the date immediately before the impending breach became public knowledge and, on the other hand, the current date. The Claimants elect 30 September 2012, the date which gives them the highest reparation when compensation and interest are combined (see Cl. Skel., para. 191).\n\n749.\n\nThe Claimants note that the State cannot benefit from its own breaches and, therefore, in assessing fair market value no account must be taken of the measures that breached the BITs and the Respondent\u2019s other obligations toward the Claimants, or the fact that other properties of third parties were expropriated. The Claimants state that their valuations are therefore on a \"but for\" basis. The \"but for\" factors taken into account in the Claimants\u2019 valuation are: (i) the effect that Settlers/War Veterans had on the Claimants\u2019 investments; and (ii) the effect that the aggressive phases of the LRP had on Zimbabwe\u2019s economy. The Claimants note the specific adjustments made by its valuation experts at para. 178 of its Post-Hearing Brief. The Claimants note that, whatever use they have had of the Zimbabwean Properties, this does not negate the Respondent\u2019s obligation to pay compensation as they have pleaded. The Claimants state that they have reinvested all profits back into the Estates since they were expropriated, and that these amounts will remain in the Estates and will inure to the Respondent unless restitution is ordered. If restitution is ordered or compensation is awarded at a current date, there can be no objection to these amounts inuring to the Claimants because, under customary international law and circumstances of unlawful expropriation, if a claimant elects damages to be assessed at the current date, the Increase invalue since expropriation Inures to the claimant (see Cl. PHB, para. 182).\n\n750.\n\nFinally, the Claimants note that the level of damages due should not be reduced or delayed according to the Respondent State\u2019s ability to pay or according to the fact that the expropriation is part of a large-scale nationalization (see Cl. Skel., para. 197, citing *CME Czech Republic BV v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 September 2001, CLEX-191; *Funnekotter,* CLEX-242).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n751.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position, on the basis of Article 34 of the ILC Articles, that once wrongfulness of a measure is excluded, compensation as a form of reparation cannot be required (see Resp. PHB, para. 310). Article 34 of the ILC Articles provides as follows:\n\nArticle 34\n\nForms of reparation\n\nFull reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n752.\n\nThe Respondent submits, on the basis of its position that the takings were consistent with public order principles or public policy, that no compensation is due. In the event any compensation is due, and as regards the date of any valuation of the Claimants\u2019 claims, the Respondent notes that Article 4 of the German BIT stipulates that \"effective compensation... shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or Impending expropriation, nationalization or other comparable measure becomes publicly known\". The Respondent states that its valuation expert, Mr. Moyo, has valued the claims and the Estates as of 10 August 2012 (see Moyo III, para. 1). The Respondent notes, however, that If the Claimants are to receive any compensation for the expropriation of land, the appropriate date of valuation should be 13 September 2005, and the burden is on the Claimants to prove the market value of assets that they allege as the basis of their claims as at that date. The Respondent also submits that while the theoretical valuation should be as at the day before the date of the expropriation complained of, the circumstances in this case are extraordinary in that while the Claimants were \"on paper\" expropriated, they remain on the properties and are still on the properties carrying on business as usual, disposing of moveable assets at will, all without paying rentals to the State. The Respondent therefore argues that whatever amounts may be due for compensation, indemnity or interest, any appreciation that has taken place between the date of the taking and now must be attributed to the Claimants, and this constitutes full payment (see Resp. PHB, paras. 367 to 368).\n\n753.\n\nThe Respondent has also argued that the Tribunal should take into consideration Zimbabwe\u2019s ability to pay any compensation ordered. The Respondent refers to a number of sources in support of its proposition that compensation should be \"just\" (see Rejoinder, paras. 1061-1077).\n\n754.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that delayed payment of any compensation awarded is contemplated by the German and Swiss BIT Protocols, which each contain derogation provisions regarding payment of compensation in certain situations by enabling payments over a period up to six years or that payment could be frozen in a local bank (see Rejoinder, para. 1080).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\na) Standard of Compensation for Expropriation\n---------------------------------------------\n\n755.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that compensation is appropriate in two circumstances. The first situation is where the Respondent refuses to comply with an award of restitution. If that occurs, then the value of the assets subject to restitution will be awarded in the alternative. Secondly, even if restitution is complied with, in respect of the Forrester and Border Estates there is a shortfall between the current \"as is\" value of the assets and the \"but for\" value of the assets had there been no breach by the Respondent. This is properly reflected in the award of a further pecuniary sum to the Claimants, which will hereafter be referred to as the \"Restitution Shortfalls\". The Tribunal discusses the *quantum* of this compensation below.\n\nb) Applicable Standard of Compensation\n--------------------------------------\n\n756.\n\nThe starting point for compensation must be the German and Swiss BITs. Relevantly, Article 4(2) of the German BIT reads:\n\nInvestments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalised or subjected to any other measure the effect of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalisation in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment immediately before the date on which the actual or Impending expropriation, nationalisation or other comparable measure becomes publicly known.\n\n757.\n\nSimilarly, the relevant portion of Article 6 of the Swiss BIT provides:\n\nInvestments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the real value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realisable and be freely transferable.\n\n758.\n\nAs will be apparent, both BITs provide the appropriate level of compensation for lawful expropriation; \"lawful\" meaning expropriation according to the terms of the BITs. However, the Tribunal is not confronted by lawful expropriation in this situation. As the Tribunal has determined, the acquisitions of the Claimants\u2019 Estates were unlawful. Neither BIT purports to provide for the appropriate level of compensation for unlawful expropriation.\n\n759.\n\nInsuch circumstances, the Tribunal must Instead approach relief under customary international law. This principle was recognised in *ADC Affiliate Limited v. Republic of Hungary*  ***(\"ADC\"\u2019)***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, para. 483, CLEX-220):\n\nSince the BIT does not contain any lex specialis rules that govern the issue of the standard for assessing damages in the case of an unlawful expropriation, the Tribunal is required to apply the default standard contained in customary international law in the present case.\n\n760.\n\nICSID tribunals have treated this approach as authoritative and followed it elsewhere (see e.g., *Siemens,* CLEX-223; *Siag,* CLEX-243; *Kardassopoulos,* CLEX-248; *ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company* v. *Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/2,18 May 2010, CLEX-250). As Dr. Sabahi remarks, \"in the post-ADC world, there is a recognition among most arbitral tribunals that there should be a distinction between the international law applicable to lawful vis a vis unlawful expropriations\" (see Sabahi, p. 102, CLEX-306). The Tribunal accepts that the *ADC* approach is the approach It should adopt. Therefore, the Respondent is liable for compensation under customary international law for unlawful breaches of the two BITs.\n\n761.\n\nThe approach of customary international law to reparation is founded in *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* which is reflected in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Customary international law requires the Tribunal to \"compensate for the damage caused\", which includes \"any financially assessable damage Including loss of profits Insofar as it is established\" (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 218, CLEX-273). Usually a Tribunal will assess compensation based on the value of the assets at the time of expropriation (or just before). Most BITs provide for this standard. However, this is not always appropriate. As the Tribunal in *ADC* stated (see\u00a0*ADC,* para. 496, CLEX-220):\n\nThe present case is almost unique among decided cases concerning the expropriation by States of foreign owned property, since the value of the investment after the date of expropriation (1 January 2002) has risen very considerably while other arbitrations that apply the Chorz\u00f3w Factory standard all invariably involve scenarios where there has been a decline in the value of the investment after regulatory interference. It is for this reason that application of the restitution standard by various arbitration tribunals has led to use of the date of the expropriation as the date for the valuation of damages.\n\n762.\n\nThen, after analysing decisions departing from the \"date of expropriation\" approach, the *ADC* tribunal continued (see *ibid* *.,* para. 498, CLEX-220):\n\nBased on the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it must assess the compensation to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimants in accordance with the Chorz\u00f3w Factory standard, i.e., the Claimants should be compensated the market value of the expropriated Investments as at the date of this Award, which the Tribunal takes as of September 30, 2006.\n\n763.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that this is the correct approach to use in this case. The Tribunal is faced with one of those rare cases where the value of the unlawfully expropriated assets has increased from the time of the unlawful expropriation. As compensation is an alternative remedy to restitution (applying if the Respondent does not perform restitution), the sum of compensation should be the financial equivalent to that which would have been returned to the Claimants. This principle was stated by former ICJ President Jimenez de Arechaga and cited by Professor Dupuy in *Texaco*(see *Texaco,* para. 102, CLEX-157): \"Since monetary compensation must, as far as possible, resemble restitution, the value at the date when the indemnity is paid must be the criterion\".\n\n764.\n\nInconclusion, the Tribunal considers that compensation should be calculated at the time of the Award, rather than at the time of the unlawful acts. The Tribunal has no difficulty in reaching this conclusion because, as Heinrich\u2019s evidence shows (see Heinrich I, paras. 43-538), the Claimants have continually reinvested the returns from their investments. Whoever has ownership of the land (and other assets) has the benefit of that reinvestment.\n\nc) Restitution Shortfalls\n-------------------------\n\n765.\n\nIn the event that restitution is awarded and performed, the Claimants contend that they still require compensation to put them in the position they would have been in \"but for\" the Respondent\u2019s breaches (see Cl. PHB, para. 223). The Claimants express this as the difference between the \"as is\" value and the \"but for\" value of the Forrester and Border Estates. The Claimants do not claim a Restitution Shortfall in respect of the Makandi Estate (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 7.03.13, Corrected CE-7).\n\n766.\n\nIt is important to clarify the conceptual difference between the \"as is\" and \"but for\" valuations. The \"as is\" value reflects the current value of the respective Estates in light of all the circumstances, including the breaches committed by the Respondent and the reinvestment carried out by the Claimants. The \"but for\" value, in contrast, is a hypothetical value; it is the value of the Estates which would have existed had the Respondent not acted unlawfully. This approach is conceptually consistent with providing full compensation under the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle. The Restitution Shortfalls provide the Claimants with compensation for the value that the Estates would have held \"but for\" the Respondent\u2019s breaches. Even if the Claimants receive restitution of the Estates, that will only return to them the current \"as is\" value of those properties. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that the Restitution Shortfalls are necessary to provide full reparation to the Claimants.\n\n767.\n\nAs the Claimants make clear, Mr. Levitt\u2019s methodology for calculating the \"as is\" value of the Estates to arrive at the Restitution Shortfalls is essentially the same as the methodology he has used for calculating the \"but for\" value, although without a \"but for\" adjustment. As such, the Restitution Shortfalls will be appropriately calculated along the same lines as the \" but for\" values so long as there is scrutiny of the Inputs used to quantify the \"as is\" value of the Estates. Once the Tribunal considers the \"as is\" valuations and is satisfied with them, calculating the Restitution Shortfalls is then straightforward (the difference between the \"but for\" value and the \"as is\" value). This approach appears fair to the Tribunal, and it is noted that while the Respondent has attacked the valuations generally, it has not specifically challenged the calculation of the Restitution Shortfalls.\n\n(4) Valuation\n-------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\na) Forrester and Makandi Estates\n--------------------------------\n\n768.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants submit that, while their valuation expert, Mr. Levitt, considered various possible approaches to valuing the Forrester and Makandi Estates, settling on the Fair Market Value (\"FMV\") and market-based approaches respectively, the Respondent\u2019s expert, Mr. Moyo, considered only one approach, the Depreciated Replacement Cost **(\"DRC\")** method. The von Pezold Claimants also note that, while Mr. Moyo challenged the comparator transactions proposed by Mr. Stephenson for valuation of the Makandi Estate, he has not substantiated his assertion that farms inneighbouring countries are bad comparables because they are indifferent prevailing economic conditions (see Cl. PHB, paras. 187-188; Moyo II, para. 7, R-15). Mr. Moyo did, however, expand on this assertion inresponse to a question from Professor Williams (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1670-1671):\n\nARBITRATOR WILLIAMS: I just have a couple of questions. If you would look at your Second Witness Statement, which is in Tab 2 of this binder. Paragraph 7, \"Farms in the neighboring countries are not good comparables as they are in \u2018different prevailing economic conditions.\u2019\"\n\nCould you just tell me what that means, \"different prevailing economic conditions\"?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Different prevailing economic conditions.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, at that time what\u2014we had the Land Reform Programme was ongoing, the\u2014was no market, or there were no farms which were being sold through\u2014through the market because if your are selling a farm\u2014if you want to sell a farm, you have to offer the farm to the Government.\n\nNot only that, the labor in Zimbabwe, the labor is freely available, farm laborers. If you go to South Africa, you see that they use laborers from neighboring countries. There are things like\u2014other factors, like even the salary structures, they are different.\n\nSo, those are some the factors which were different from\u2014which we indicated that they were different.\n\n769.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants reason, on the basis of Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s evidence, that the DRC method is inappropriate to value the Makandi and Forrester Estates as these entities are going concerns. The von Pezold Claimants refer to the following testimony of Mr. Kanyekanye given in relation to valuation of the Border Estate (see Cl. PHB, para. 189, quoting Tr. Day 6, p. 1726):\n\nTHE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nThis is my explanation. The explanation is that Border is a going concern, and as a going concern, you then ask yourself what is the appropriate method to use for valuation.\n\nSo I said, okay, let\u2019s look at all the valuations method that could be used. So, we looked there to say, let\u2019s start off by saying, a Net Asset Value, does it work. And I think If you read through my Submissions, I said for a going concern, you cannot use a Net Asset Value.\n\n770.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants also note that Mr. Moyo acknowledged on cross-examination during the Hearing that the valuation of a going concern must consider future profits and business assets, which are not accounted for when applying the DRC method (see Cl. PHB, para. 189; Tr. Day 6, pp. 1668-1670):\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: And I can\u2019t find the exact paragraph, but I know It\u2019s there somewhere, you\u2019ve Indicated some other possible methods, for example, Residual Value, Profits, Capitalization of Earnings, and so on.\n\nYou have not discussed inyour-any of your reports why those methods would not have been an appropriate method of valuation for the land, including the Improvements-I mean, in other words, valuing the business as a business based on earnings?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Like the valuation of a going concern: That one, when you are valuing as a going concern, you have to look at the future profits and the assets. But it was not possible for us to do that given the circumstances and what was available before us.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: So, are you saying that you could not do It because you didn\u2019t have the materials to do It? That you didn\u2019t have the accounts of the companies and so on?\n\nTHE WITNESS: It was not\u2014It was not applicable.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: You had predetermined that it was not appllcable-those methods were not applicable?\n\nTHE WITNESS: They were not applicable.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: They were not applicable because of the statutory provisions under the Land Acquisition Act, or It was not applicable for professional valuation reasons?\n\nTHE WITNESS: They were not applicable because of the prevailing circumstances, not because of the statutory situations.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: Yes, but what do you consider to be the prevailing circumstances that made it inapplicable to measure the value of the land by its capacity to earn money for the owner?\n\nTHE WITNESS: There are several variables which will affect the value of land. And the market also-market conditions also affect the value of land. As I indicated at the time, there was no longer any market for-for farms.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG: Yeah, but that gets you into comparable sales.\n\nBut if you had traced the track record of what the company had been earning from the farming activities, then you have a basis for creating a model for one of the alternative methods of valuation, wouldn\u2019t that be so?\n\nTHE WITNESS: What we did is we looked at the various methods, and it was, in our\u2014our opinion that the methods were not applicable.\n\nARBITRATOR HWANG; Okay. Thank you.\n\n771.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants observe that, save for an unsupported comment in the Respondent\u2019s Skeleton Argument, no criticism has been levelled at Mr. Levitt\u2019s application of the Discounted Cash Flow **(\"DCF\")** method to value the Forrester Estate or the application of the market-based method to value the Makandi Estate. The comment inquestion relates to Mr. Ridley\u2019s cattle valuation based on South African cattle, which the Respondent alleged are not comparable to Zimbabwean cattle values (see Cl. PHB, para. 191; Resp. Skel., para. 243).\n\n772.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants submit that Mr. Moyo\u2019s valuations should be rejected, and Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuations preferred for several fundamental reasons (see Cl. PHB, paras. 192-195):\n\n\u2022 Mr. Moyo made errors in his calculations that he has failed to correct (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1097, Levitt Direct examination);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Moyo\u2019s purported land values for Forrester and Makandi respectively cannot be tied back to the three comparables that he allegedly used to carry out his valuation (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1096-1107, Levitt Direct examination);\n\n\u2022 Mr. Moyo\u2019s three comparators are not based on arm\u2019s-length transactions or other appropriate comparators and Inappropriate dates for each transaction were used (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 989-995, Stephenson Direct examination); and\n\n\u2022 Mr. Moyo is not a credible witness because he is not Independent of the Respondent (see Moyo I, para. 1, R-3; Tr. Day 6, pp. 1594 and 1688, exchange between Respondent and the Tribunal).\n\nb) Border Estate\n----------------\n\n773.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mr. Levitt also considered a variety of alternative approaches to valuing the land and forestry assets of Border Estate.\n\n774.\n\nWith respect to land, Mr. Levitt used the market-based method, relying on comparator transactions provided by Mr. Stephenson, and, with respect to standing timber, Mr. Levitt used three different methods according to the age of the tree: (1) the Accumulated Current Actual Cost **(\"ACAC\")** method for the least mature trees; (2) the actual current felling values for overmature trees; and (3) the Faustmann Formula (a form of DCF) for the remaining immature trees in rotation (see Cl. PHB, paras. 199-200).\n\n775.\n\nThe use of the Faustmann Formula, in particular, is contested. Mr. Daugherty, a South African forestry expert, provided expert evidence supportive of the use of the Faustmann Formula in cases such as these. Mr. Kanyekanye criticized reliance on this formula. The Claimants contend that Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s criticisms of the Faustmann Formula are misplaced (see Cl. PHB, paras. 201-203).\n\n776.\n\nThe Claimants also reject the Respondent\u2019s suggestion, by reference to International Accounting Standard 41, that Mr. Levitt has not performed an FMV valuation of Border\u2019s standing timber, reasoning as follows (see Cl. PHB, para. 205):\n\n... [T]he Respondent\u2019s position is ill-founded as IAS 41 is relevant to financial reporting, and not to a valuation of the whole business for sale or expropriation compensation purposes. IAS 41 is not consistent with the Fair Market Value compensation standard required by the BITs and CIL(see para 175 above). This is because IAS 41 only permits the valuation of the actual realisable value of a property\u2019s timber at any point intime, and does not allow for unreallsable profit to be reflected in the balance sheet: ineffect, IAS 41 requires a valuation of the standing timber as If the entire forest were to be felled and sold in its then-current state. As such, it Ignores the fact that the trees are not Intended to be harvested when Immature, thereby Ignoring the potential future value that Immature trees would generate. Inorder to receive Fair Market Value, an owner upon sale or for expropriation compensation purposes is entitled to recognise and be compensated for that value over the full rotation period and not just Immediately prior to harvesting. Valuations using the Faustmann Formula are consistent with this standard. Mr Daugherty\u2019s evidence demonstrates the difference between a Faustmann Formula valuation and a valuation inaccordance with IAS 41.\n\n777.\n\nThe Claimants note that Mr. Kanyekanye proposes to value the Border Estate using a market capitalisation method. The Claimants reject the use of such a method for the following reasons (see Cl. PHB, para. 206):\n\nFirst, it does not produce an accurate indicator of Border\u2019s value due to the illiquid nature of Border\u2019s shares owing to the vast majority being owned by the von Pezold Claimants. Second, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange can only be used to derive an \"as is\" value of the minority interest in Border and is therefore not an Indicator of the \"but for\" Fair Market Value of the Border Estate. Finally, Mr Kanyekanye\u2019s Updated Thesis has Identified numerous Issues with the reliability of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and presents no counter-position to that negative account. Although Mr Kanyekanye has asserted that those criticisms are simply his reporting of the literature and that this opinions are in the conclusion section, the conclusions section contains no discussion as to the reliability of the ZSE. Thus, the only mention of the reliability of the ZSE in Mr Kanyekanye\u2019s evidence casts doubt on its accuracy, and he has presented nothing to contradict his position.\n\n778.\n\nThe Claimants observe that the Respondent has criticized Mr. Levitt\u2019s application of the above methodologies to value the Border Estate, and in particular as the application of the Faustmann Formula relates to two Inputs: (i) Net Standing Value **(\"NSV\")** of mature pine sawlogs and (ii) the Border Estate\u2019s plantation area and age class profile (see Cl. PHB, para. 207).\n\n779.\n\nAs regards the NSV of mature pine sawlogs, the Claimants submit that there are two contractual scenarios that can be used to establish NSV, the sale of standing timber (whereby the buyer Incurs the cost of harvesting and extracting logs) or the sale of logs at the plantation roadside (whereby the seller Incurs the cost of harvesting and extracting logs). Mr. Levitt used the second method to calculate the NSV for mature pine sawlogs based on second and third thinnings quality to produce what the Claimants describe as a conservative estimate of value for the Border timber. The Claimants submit that Mr. Levitt\u2019s application of the Faustmann Formula should be preferred to Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s proposed alternative, which is based on eucalyptus sawlogs rather than pine, Includes a deduction for transport costs to South Africa, and would amount to \"economic suicide\" inview of the low NSV attributed to mature pine sawlogs (see Cl. PHB, para. 211).\n\n780.\n\nAs regards the plantation area and age class distribution, the Claimants reject Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s assertion that the plantation area and age class distribution used by Mr. Levitt are speculative. The Claimants assert that the basis for establishing the Border Estate\u2019s plantation area and age class distribution was the actual, \"as is\" state of Border\u2019s forest as recorded in\"Microforest\". The Claimants rely on Mr. van der Lingen\u2019s evidence concerning the use and reliability of data in Microforest, as well as Mr. Levitt\u2019s evidence that he relied only upon the Inventory function of Microforest and not its simulation function (see Cl. PHB, para. 213; see also Tr. Day 3, pp. 768-769, 779-783, 799, 802 - van der Lingen Direct, Cross and Re-dlrect examination; Tr. Day 4, pp. 1152-1153 - Levitt Re-dlrect examination).\n\n781.\n\nThe Claimants note inregard to Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s market capitalisation valuation of Border that he has failed to provide any documentary support or explanation as to how his figure was ascertained. The Claimants refer the Tribunal to Mr. Levitt\u2019s detailed critique on Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s valuation and calculations (see Cl. PHB, para. 215; Levitt II (Corrected), paras. 2.04.1 -2.04.24). The Claimants also submit that Mr. Kanyekanye lacks credibility as a witness, reasoning principally that he is not Independent, being employed by a company owned by the Respondent and which is a competitor of Border, and that he \"deliberately misled the Tribunals as to his qualifications\", referring to his assertion that he has been awarded a doctoral degree from Calvary University (see Cl. PHB, para. 216-220).\n\n782.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that Mr. Moyo\u2019s purported alternative valuation of Border to that of Dr. Kanyakanye should also be rejected, relying on the same criticism of Mr. Moyo\u2019s approach and application of his DRC approach to value Border as discussed above in respect of Makandi and Forrester. Moreover, the Claimants note that Mr. Moyo has failed to include any value for Border\u2019s standing timber, Border\u2019s most significant asset (see Cl. PHB, para. 221).\n\nc) Forrester and Border Restitution Shortfalls\n----------------------------------------------\n\n783.\n\nThe Claimants note that Mr. Levitt has valued this loss by calculating the properties\u2019 restitution value using the same methodology as for his valuation of each Estate, but using the non-adjusted \"as is\" inputs, then subtracting the \"as is\" value from the \"but for\" value (i.e. Heads of Loss 1,2,9 and 10). The Claimants note that the Respondent has neither challenged this valuation nor proposed an alternative valuation, aside from challenging the valuation methodologies as related to the Estates, discussed above (see Cl. PHB, para. 223).\n\nd) Zimbabwean Company Shares\n----------------------------\n\n784.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the diminution in share value of the Zimbabwean Companies is equivalent to their lost interest in the expropriated assets. The Claimants assert, on the basis of the following passage from the Counter-Memorial, that the Respondent has accepted this position (see Cl. PHB, para. 224; CM, para. 151):\n\nThe acquisition of the income producing assets of the Forrester companies, the Border companies and the Makandi companies through the Constitutional Amendment inevitably means that the shares are affected but that has been factored Into the valuation for compensation.\n\n785.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Claimants note that the Respondent\u2019s objections to the valuation of the three Estates apply.\n\ne) Other Heads of Damage\n------------------------\n\n786.\n\nFinally, the Claimants note that only Mr. Levitt has undertaken valuations of the following Heads of Damage and that these valuations have not been challenged by the Respondent: the Seized Maize, the Forrester Loans, the Forrester Water Rights, Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall, Forrester Conversion Amount, Border Liquidation Shortfall, and Border Forex Losses (see Cl. PHB, para. 225). These valuations are described in detail at paras. 166-170 and 179-180 of the Claimants\u2019 Skeleton Argument and are set out among the heads of loss in Schedule 2 to the Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n787.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the LRP was not wrongful and therefore compensation as a form of reparation cannot be required. In the event the Tribunal does find a breach, however, the Respondent advances several *quantum-related* arguments.\n\n788.\n\nFirst, the Respondent complains that any Inadequacy in its *quantum* calculations resulting from lack of Information is due to the access provided to the Respondent, and Mr. Moyo in particular, to the Claimants\u2019 records. The Respondent notes that the Tribunal cannot simply assume that the Claimants are correct in their damages calculations. The Respondent refers in particular to Mr. Moyo\u2019s third Witness Statement, in which he comments as follows (see Moyo III, para. 7):\n\nA list of assets was provided by Claimants' management. Where the asset is shown as not seen I maintain that is the correct position as Claimants' officers failed to point out the assets. Similarly for assets shown as scrap, Claimants' officers pointed out that it was scrap material. Since all the inspections were carried out in the presence of representatives of the Estates the Claimants cannot turn around and say our inventory is incorrect. If there were items which had gone for repair we were supposed to be told where they were and values would have been put to those assets.\n\n789.\n\nThe Respondent has used three separate methods to value the Claimants\u2019 alleged losses: (1) the share value method (Border); (2) comparable sales method (Forrester and Makandi); and (3) DRC (Border, Forrester and Makandi). The Respondent states the following as regards share value of Border (see Resp. PHB, paras. 316 and 320):\n\n316. Share valuation is a recognized and regularly used method of determining fair market value of a going concern. It is often preferred to other methods. International law recognises share value as an appropriate method of valuation.\n\n\u2026\n\n320. Respondent\u2019s position agreed to by Messrs Moyo and Kanyekanye is that known Border Estate Share value constitutes full value for purposes of these arbitrations. Dr Kanyekanye determined the value of the Border Estate by determination of the value of its shares. The shareholding valuation of Border is the only quoted price value. Dr Kanyekanye established the Border share valuation at $6 763 044, the quoted price value. Mr Moyo\u2019s final Witness Statement concurs with the Kanyekanye opinion that the share valuation figure, $6 763 044, the quoted price value should prevail.\n\n790.\n\nAs regards the comparable sales method applied to the Forrester and Makandi Estates, the Respondent asserts as follows (see Resp. PHB, paras. 317-318):\n\n317. The value of the Estates determined by recourse to the comparable sales method by definition includes the value of land and of improvements.\n\n318. As Mr Moyo writes in R-80, Respondent\u2019s land values for Forrester and Makandi were arrived at by means of specified comparable sales. Inresponse to the questions posed during Oral Hearings in Washington, D.C., and Mr Stephenson\u2019s responses, it appears that Claimants\u2019 comparables do not take into account local circumstances outside expropriation and are not \"comparable.\" Mr Moyo used three Zimbabwean farms as comparables for the land values while Respondent maintains that using South African or Zimbabwe\u2019s neighbouring countries\u2019 values for land would be Inappropriate as Zimbabwe and its neighbouring countries have different economic conditions which have an Impact on property values. Contrary to Claimants\u2019 allegation, the comparable sales used by Respondent are arms\u2019 length transactions. The sales for the three comparators were arms\u2019 length transactions and records at the Deeds Registry office Indicate that the properties were sold. Had the properties been donated the records would have Indicated that, thus in the absence of any proof to the contrary, Respondent maintains that these were arms\u2019 length transactions and the Arbitral Tribunals should accept them as such, placing a maximum amount on the properties\u2019 total value for land and Improvements.\n\n791.\n\nThe Respondent defends its choice of local Zimbabwean comparables and asserts that as the Claimants chose Zimbabwe to host their investment, the Claimants \"get Zimbabwe comparables \u2018as is\u2019\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 323).\n\n792.\n\nFinally, as regards the DRC method, the Respondent submits as follows (see Resp. PHB, para. 319):\n\n319. Mr Moyo\u2019s Valuation R-03 and R-15 and their Schedules cover land, immovable improvements and plant and machinery. Claimants provided Inventories. No need to value trees per se, as the Moyo value is for the business as a whole is all-inclusive as Claimants choose to value the business as a whole based only on trees. Moyo\u2019s method is an alternate value to Claimants\u2019 method.\n\n793.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the comparable sales method may also be used as an alternate method to value the Border Estate, or in the further alternative, the DRC method. The Respondent submits that Mr. Moyo\u2019s alternative valuation of Border is reasonable and analogous to the Claimants\u2019 \"choice to make the assumption that the value of Border is just plantations\". According to the Respondent, the converse assumption is made by Mr. Moyo, \"that value is being confined to assets other than trees\" (see Resp. PHB, para. 327). The Respondent reasons that the Net Asset Value **(\"NAV\")** approaches taken by Mr. Levitt exaggerate values and in reality are not net asset values for a whole estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Respondent acknowledges that the valuation prepared by Mr. Moyo for Border does not cover timber and appears to take the position that this is covered by Mr. Kanyekanye, therefore it would appear that the Respondent\u2019s proposed alternative valuation of Border would or could require a cumulating of values proposed by Messrs. Moyo and Kanyekanye (see Resp. PHB, para. 328).\n\n794.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the Claimants\u2019 reliance on a \"but for\" approach to valuation, arguing as follows (see Resp. PHB, paras. 330-332):\n\n330. The questions from the Arbitral Tribunals and Mr Stephenson\u2019s response show \"but for\" is ill defined by Claimants\u2019 experts who did not use their Individual and Independent professional judgment to determine (i) the most appropriate methods of evaluation, but merely followed directions from Claimants\u2019 counsel, without passing those directions through their own critical lenses to form a view as to whether the Instructed method was well suited to the exercise, (ii) whether or not the Instructed method was the only method or whether methods also existed viewed and finally, (iii) whether the method used was the best method for that kind of evaluation. Claimants\u2019 experts worked with blinders, for example even (a) evaluating sawmills that have been decommissioned and (b) not taking Into account power outages. None of Claimants\u2019 experts have been able to clearly define the meaning of \"but for\" and take the easy but erroneous route of comparing with Natal South Africa, not only falling to take into account the specificities of Zimbabwe since 2000, but more Importantly, using as comparables two very different economies, even before Zimbabwe Land Reform as Zimbabwe was not at all at the same economic level as South Africa before beginning its Land Reform. Even comparing sales before Land Reform would have been wrong and biased. Even before throwing in the \"but for\" there was no legitimate comparison possible.\n\n331. No single forestry professional on Claimants\u2019 valuation team formed an overall opinion on the fair market value but each provided morsels of parcelled Information for Londonlan spread sheet specialists guided by a team of six lawyers none of whom are forestry specialists.\n\n332. Further the numbers used mix various types of data, such as Micro Forest databases, land sales inforeign countries, from varying years. They do not have exact data for compartments at the same single date nor at the expropriation date and have admitted that the data they have have a substantial margin of error.\n\n795.\n\nAs regards the age class of trees, mix of species, difficulty of access to the trees and quality of the trees on the Border Estate, the Respondent submits that such factors do not support Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation and, in the absence of Land Reform, the only willing buyer of Border\u2019s forestry business would need \"asymmetric ignorance\", referring to Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s testimony in response to Tribunal questioning (see Resp. PHB, para. 333; Tr. Day 6, p. 1850).\n\n796.\n\nThe Respondent raises the following two criticisms of the Claimants\u2019 price estimate for Border\u2019s standing timber (see Resp. PHB, para. 334-335):\n\n334. It is documented fact that the parties agreed to an arm\u2019s length value of standing timber at the relevant time. Claimants wrongly assume a Roadside log price of $41.37/m3 on site in Zimbabwe when that figure is for Rustenburg, South Africa. Claimants\u2019 costs-lead-to-prlce calculations are fundamentally flawed as they wrongly (i) confuse the meaning of Standing Timber and (ii) consider price to be an abstract concept, not taking Into account the real market price, which is ultimately in South Africa at the port of embarkation or the point of sale. Claimants erroneously would have these Arbitral Tribunals fix the market price on Claimants\u2019 sort-of-cost-plus-basis.\n\n335. Price depends on the size of the logs, but Claimants erroneously give one price for all cuts, including DDDs, first thinnings and pulpwood. Claimants also mistakenly assume that market applications in Zimbabwe are the same as in South Africa, England or Canada. Zimbabwe does not have a market for Christmas trees, forestry recreational activities or small diameters cuts.\n\n797.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the valuation figures provided by Mr. Daugherty, Mr. Ridley and Mr. van der Lingen and Mr. Bottger are all incorrect for the reasons set out in Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s third Witness Statement (without further specification as to why) (see Resp. PHB, para. 338). The following paragraphs, among others, from Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s third Witness Statement appear to be relevant to this general criticism of the valuation figures proposed by these witnesses (see Kanyekanye III, R-71):\n\n11. As discussed in my second witness statement, hedonistic pricing or use of proxies are generally used when there are no quoted prices. Inparagraph 52, George Bottger concedes a log market in Zimbabwe contrary to the infamous Levitt statement that there is no log market in Zimbabwe. Why did Mr. Levitt use these prices that BTL used when buying standing timber? Surely, these would address problems we have now.\n\n12. Paragraphs 53 to 60 are an attempt at explaining a false declaration where the quoted price of felled high quality peeler logs was used to falsify log values. Surely if the best and largest log in Zimbabwe is sold at the log deck (not at roadside) at $40/m (inclusive of harvesting and skidding cost plus overhead) how one can possibly justify the figures for standing timber used in Mr. Levitt's first statement?\n\nTo suggest tongue-in-cheek that the price was fair \"considering Allied Timbers had previously offered BTL sawlogs from Maswera Section on one of their Northern Estates at $40/m3 standing\" shows my fears on George's submissions. We offered and the contract was not accepted! The price was the issue. The claimants go no to use the same price that they rejected. This is unethical. Paragraph 60 does not add value; it is irrelevant.\n\n13. Inparagraph 64, Bottger gives an interesting insight which suggests that the claimants bought logs at $40/m3 from Mutare Board. A simple calculation using normal extraction costs suggests a quoted standing price of $19/m3. Even in this worst case scenario, George at least puts the standing price at $27/m3. We at least have a retreat from theory to quoted price from a technician. The impact of this is that George is simply saying standing price for pine must be $27/m3. This is still too high but it's an acknowledgement that Mr. Levitt's original statement was incorrect, subjective and prepared for advocacy purposes.\n\n\u2026\n\n17. Mr. van Der Lingen is quoted as saying BTL logs are 'C' class quality in paragraph 9 but this is neither here nor there. The use of South African log prices as comparator is irrelevant while the claim that mostly juvenile logs cut at BTL are 'C' class is incorrect.\n\n798.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation of Border is or must be \"discredited\" because it wrongly uses the Faustmann Formula and because the Claimants rely on non-comparable comparators from Natal for timber values, which are only valid for Natal and not even the whole of South Africa. The Respondent also submits that Mr. Levitt ignored quoted sales of standing timber between Border and the Forestry Commission in 2001 and arm\u2019s length transactions between Border and Allied Timbers in 2005 shortly before the Constitutional Amendment in 2005 (see Resp. PHB, para. 339).\n\n799.\n\nThe Respondent expands on this point as follows (see Resp. PHB, para. 349):\n\n349. Claimant Heinrich, a director of Border, wrote in his Fourth Witness Statement that the prices in the February 2005 Agreement between the Forestry Company of Zimbabwe and Border Timbers Limited were \"a reasonable price.\" Heinrich further conceded on this reference that Border purchased and harvested sawlogs from Allied Timbers in 2005. Thinnings in this contract are priced at Z$250,000/m3 while mature trees where at Z$450,000/m3 proving that the Levitt approach use of $40/m3 is defective. Thinnings are in fact 56% of the value of clearfellings whereas Levitt used the same price throughout, including using unutilisable gum firebreaks to artificially and unscrupulously increase utilizable timber volumes. The agreed nearest quoted price for standing trees is given as February 10, 2005. The exchange rate used here came from Claimants and in June 2005 it was about Z$10,000 to 1 US$. This is the closest, real and largest fair market transaction done in Zimbabwe for standing trees in 2005 that serves as a signature transaction and a reality check to any theoretical extrapolations or valuations!\n\n800.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that Border\u2019s own audited financial statements for 2005, prior to the Constitutional Amendment, value Border on the basis of the DRC method at approximately US$8,328 million assuming 100% of the value of Border or US$7,203 million assuming 86.49% of the value of Border (i.e., the Claimants\u2019 share) (see Resp. PHB, para. 351). This is offered as the third best alternative value for Border (the first being the estimated value on the share value approach and the second being estimated value on the market capitalisation approach). The further values estimated by the Respondent\u2019s experts of Border are set out inparas. 352 to 365 of the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\na) Introduction\n---------------\n\n801.\n\nThe Parties have made submissions on *quantum* for: (i) Forrester Estate; (ii) Makandi Estate; (iii) Border Estate; (iv) Forrester and Border Estates Restitution Shortfalls if restitution is awarded; (v) the Zimbabwean Company Shares; and (vi) the various other Heads of Damage. The Tribunal discusses each of these below.\n\n802.\n\nThe Claimants have valued the Estates on both \"as is\" and \"but for\" bases (apart from the Makandi Estate; see below para. 837). Both are important whether the Respondent complies with restitution or not. If the Respondent falls to provide resitution, then the \"but for\" valuations are used as the compensation sum. However, even if restitution is provided, the Tribunal must still, for the reasons outlined above at paras. 766-767, calculate the Restitution Shortfalls based on the difference between the \"as is\" valuation of the Estates, which the Claimants will have returned to them, and the \"but for\" valuation of the Estates had there been no breaches committed by the Respondent.\n\nb) Respondent\u2019s Expert Witnesses\n--------------------------------\n\n803.\n\nBefore considering *quantum,* the Tribunal will first express some views on the witnesses whom the Respondent identified as its expert witnesses. For matters of *quantum,* the Respondent primarily relied upon the evidence of Messrs Kanyekanye and Moyo.\n\n804.\n\nThe Claimants challenged Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s evidence by asserting that, first of all, he was not an independent expert (see Cl. PHB, paras. 216-220). Secondly, the Claimants asserted that Mr. Kanyekanye deliberately misled the Tribunal about his qualifications because his doctorate was awarded by Calvary University, which the Claimants contend is unaccredited to award degrees.\n\n805.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 criticisms of Mr. Kanyekanye. First, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Kanyekanye is not independent of the Respondent, since Mr. Kanyekanye is the Group CEO of Allied Timbers, which is owned by the Respondent through the Zimbabwean Ministry of Finance (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1709, lines 1-9). This apparent lack of independence became an actual lack of independence during the Hearing when Mr. Kanyekanye, situated between the Zimbabwean team and the Zimbabwean counsel at the Hearing, was seen from that position to direct counsel as to the questions they should ask on re-examination of a fact witness (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1714-1715). Additionally, as to apparent lack of independence, Mr. Kanyekanye was Chairman of the Respondent\u2019s Forest Land Reform Committee (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1870, lines 12-17). Secondly, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s doctorate comes from Calvary University, which the Respondent argued was both a registered and accredited university (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1716\u2014 1718). However, the Tribunal cannot accept those submissions. As the Claimants have conclusively shown, Calvary is not officially recognised as a degree-awarding body in the United Kingdom and appears to not be accredited by any recognised university accreditation body.\n\n806.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission that Mr. Moyo, who was presented as an expert witness for the Respondent (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1594, line 4), was not an independent expert. Mr. Moyo was the Deputy Director of Valuation and Estate Management in the Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement in the Republic of Zimbabwe (see Moyo I, para. 1, R-3). Then, in his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Moyo noted his current employer was the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities (see Moyo II, para. 1, R-15). Further, Mr. Moyo\u2019s conduct during the proceedings was concerning. For example, he refused to answer legitimate questions put to him about aspects of his evidence (see e.g., Tr. Day 6, pp. 1642-1648). Inanother example, Mr. Moyo mentioned errors made in his calculations that were never corrected (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1609 to 1610).\n\n807.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal has serious concerns about the evidence provided by Messrs Kanyekanye and Moyo as neither are independent of the Respondent. The Tribunal also has concerns about the reliability of their evidence. For example, it is troubling that Mr. Moyo was uncooperative in cross-examination, refusing to discuss certain relevant parts of his evidence concerning Border Timbers. Although the Tribunal will take some account of the evidence that Messrs Kanyekanye and Moyo have provided, that evidence will be given little weight.\n\nc) Margin of Appreciation\n-------------------------\n\n808.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s concerns about the Respondent\u2019s expert evidence means that it has focussed, by necessity, on the Claimants\u2019 expert evidence, especially since in some respects, the Respondent\u2019s experts have not addressed the Claimants\u2019 expert evidence either at all or in any helpful way.\n\n809.\n\nIt remains the position that the burden is on the Claimants to prove their damages claims to the required standard. But in a case such as the present one, where there are complex valuations and extensive evidence, absolute certainty is an aspiration unlikely to be achieved.\n\n810.\n\nThe aforementioned concerns about the Respondent\u2019s \"expert\" evidence, and the lack of assistance from the Respondent, have meant that in several areas the Respondent did not directly address the Claimants\u2019 calculations or valuations. Therefore, as will be noted, the Tribunal has, where appropriate, made deductions from the Claimants\u2019 valuations. This does not mean that the Claimants have not discharged their burden of proof.\n\nd) Forrester Estate\n-------------------\n\n811.\n\nThe Forrester Estate has been operated since 1988 (see Mem., para. 189 ff). Covering 22,000 ha, the Forrester Estate is predominantly a tobacco growing and curing operation, although it also has cattle, citrus, row crops (maize and the like), and peas. The von Pezold Claimants note that the \"overall objective of Forrester Estate is to sustainably grow and sell the maximum value of high-quality tobacco, citrus, row crops and vegetables, along-side the breeding, rearing and sale of cattle\". The von Pezold Claimants submit that, notwithstanding the seizure of legal title to all ten of the Forrester Estate properties in 2005, the \"Forrester Estate continues to operate as a going concern\" and is a \"thriving business\", although the LRP and Invasions have decreased \"productivity, standards and work ethic\" (see Mem., para. 328). The Tribunal has found, it will be recalled, that in 2005 the Respondent directly expropriated all ten of the properties comprising the Forrester Estate, as well as the Water Permits then attaching to the Forrester Estate, listed in **Table 1** of the Claimants\u2019 Reply.\n\n812.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants pose two questions in relation to the Forrester Estate: (i) what is the appropriate valuation method; and (ii) has that method been applied in a reasonable way? This general two-stage approach has been adopted by the von Pezold Claimants for the other Estates as well. The Tribunal endorses this approach.\n\n(i) Valuation Method for Forrester Estate\n-----------------------------------------\n\n813.\n\nThe sum of compensation that the Tribunal arrives at should reflect the value of the Estate that would have been received if restitution had been successful; that is, the value at the date of the Award (see Irmgard Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International* *Investment Law,* Oxford University Press, New York, 2009, paras. 2,103 and 3,273-3.277, CLEX-297). Indeed, under the principle in *Chorzow Factory,* the von Pezold Claimants should bear no loss attributable to the Respondent\u2019s breaches. Valuation is therefore on a \"but for\" basis, which is the Estate\u2019s valuation unaffected by the Respondent\u2019s breaches.\n\n814.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 valuation method, namely a DCF analysis of the Forrester Estate. The Respondent\u2019s submission that a DRC analysis is appropriate is legally and commercially unsound. The Tribunal agrees with the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 submission that the Respondent has provided no credible justification for a valuation method that does not properly reflect the value of the Forrester Estate as a going concern. The Respondent\u2019s purported expert witness, Mr. Moyo, appeared not to have seriously considered valuation methods other than the DRC methodology82.\n\nSee the questions posed by Arbitrators Hwang and Williams at the Hearing and Mr. Moyo\u2019s answers (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1668 to 1671).\n\n815.\n\nIn summary, an income-based valuation should be adopted for a going concern. The Forrester Estate\u2019s value derives not only from its real property and assets, but also from its financial performance (see *ibid.* *. Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* para. 5.68, CLEX-297). Therefore, the Tribunal accepts that a DCF analysis is appropriate to value the Forrester Estate. This is a commercially sensible approach that is adaptable to the \"but for\" valuation which needs to be undertaken.\n\n816.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 submission that a DCF analysis is inappropriate for valuing the Forrester Estate\u2019s cattle. It would be inappropriate to allow the losses of cattle to reduce the overall valuation of the Forrester Estate based on a DCF valuation. Therefore, a \"but for\" market-based approach is suitable to value the cattle.\n\n*(ii) Quantum* of Forrester Estate on \"But For\" Basis\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nThe Tribunal must accordingly evaluate the application of the DCF approach undertaken by the Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Levitt. This, Mr. Levitt contends, leads to a \"but for\" valuation for the Forrester Estate (when the cattle value is added) of US$49,636,837 as at 30 September 2012. Mr. Levitt approached valuation on the basis of the fair market value garnered between a hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller (see Mem., para. 1543), and assessed on a \"but for\" basis to exclude the consequences of the Respondent\u2019s breaches (see Mem., para. 1545). Mr. Levitt focused on production values to establish the \"but for\" production of the Forrester Estate and the actual selling prices for the \"but for\" annual revenue (see Cl Skel., para. 163). He then deducted Cost of Goods Sold and Administrative Expenses from the total sales to calculate the Estate\u2019s Annual Net Profit. Mr. Levitt then established the present value of the future cash flow by using a Discount Rate calculated from a Capital Asset Pricing Model, which was divided by the Annual Net Profit.\n\n818.\n\nFirst, as to the \"but for\" basis, Mr. Levitt\u2019s approach \"assumes that the title deeds were not expropriated and that the damage caused by the Settlers/War Veterans and invasions did not take place, or is re-instated, and that the von Pezold Claimants have full unencumbered use of the entire properties at the valuation date\" (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 2.02.8, CE-7; the Tribunal notes that this \"but for\" scenario is used for the other Estates as well). Mr. Levitt, responding to challenges about the speculative nature of the \"but for\" approach, countered that he had \"only adjusted for the direct effects of the measures that breach the BITs (the aggressive phases of the Land Reform Programme after 2000, including the invasions and the Constitutional Amendment) insofar as these events affected the business\" (see *ibid.* *,* para. 2.02.10, references omitted). The Tribunal sees nothing objectionable in this approach. To be clear, the damage caused by the Settlers/War Veterans is not directly attributed to the Respondent. However, as found earlier in the present Award, the Respondent failed to prevent the invasions and the subsequent damage to the Claimants\u2019 Estates, including the Forrester Estate. Therefore, the Respondent is liable for the consequences of those invasions, which is appropriately reflected in Mr. Levitt\u2019s model for valuing the \"but for\" losses.\n\n819.\n\nMr. Levitt has approached the available statistics reasonably. He has not, for example, relied on the most favourable assumptions available to him. Generally, Mr. Levitt relies on pre-invasion production achieved in 2000-2001 (which tends to be consistent with production from around 2010-2013 when the effect of the breaches lessened) and prices from 2011-2012. Especially in respect of tobacco production, Mr. Levitt could have increased the assumption of productivity based on the land used to produce those crops (maximum of 1,000 ha) but has instead assumed 770 ha (the use of productive land had been lower in the past but had generated high yields). Mr. Levitt noted that, although the von Pezold Claimants have data on production and price prior to 2000 (which would expand the dataset), the von Pezold Claimants employed a different business strategy then (see Tr. Day 4, p. 1152, lines 5-13). Some concern could be expressed over the narrow data field used to calculate price and also yield (see *ibid.* *. Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* para. 5,122, CLEX-297). Unfortunately, the Respondent\u2019s witnesses failed to provide any detailed critique of Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculations. Nevertheless, Mr. Levitt appears to the Tribunal to have been professional in his approach and it would be inappropriate to rely on previous data collected under a discontinued business strategy. Tribunals have given weight to business plans when considering estimated future returns (see e.g., *ADC,* para. 507, CLEX-220). It would be inappropriate to rely on data collected under a different strategy, which would not reflect the practices of the von Pezold Claimants from the turn of the century.\n\n820.\n\nMr. Levitt has taken a prudent approach to calculating the Discount Rate to be used. Mr. Levitt used a Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers risk free rate, market risk premium and beta. Mr. Levitt did not limit himself to a single source of data for market risk premium and beta, and has relied on reputable sources for his data. He has also decreased the level of risk where appropriate in updating his calculations, attesting to his integrity. Ultimately, the Discount Rate for 2012 was 11.10% (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 4.09.4, CE-7). This discount rate, in the view of the Tribunal, is a reasonable one (see e.g., *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* paras. 5,214-5.215, CLEX-297).\n\n821.\n\nMr. Levitt has, however, conducted his DCF analysis on the understanding that the Forrester Estate continues in perpetuity. This is a problem, as it is often prudent to forecast revenue using several date ranges, for example, one-to-three years, three-to-ten years, or other date range (see e.g., *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* paras. 5,115, CLEX-297). Breaking down the forecasts into specific periods allows greater weight to be attached to the more accurately predicted short term. How can prices and productivity be projected for perpetuity with any certainty? Although this is of concern, the Tribunal notes that the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 two other valuations of the Forrester Estate were US$42,660,462 on a market approach, and US$51,080,087 on an asset approach (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, p. 92, CE-7). As such, it is clear that Mr. Levitt\u2019s DCF analysis has not produced an over-valuation, since Mr. Levitt\u2019s \"but for\" valuation of Forrester Estate was, as noted earlier, US$49,636,837.\n\n822.\n\nFinally, in respect of the cattle valuation, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Ridley (see Ridley II, CE-10). The evidence of Mr. Ridley has been entered into the overall valuation of the Forrester Estate (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, paras. 4.06.2-4.06.3, CE-7). Mr. Ridley used benchmark markets to determine the \"but for\" price of the cattle, which essentially involves a comparative market valuation of the cattle considered as a class of assets (or, more accurately, two classes of assets: the beef herd and the pedigree herd). Although criticised by the Respondent for using a comparison with South African markets, the Tribunal is of the view that Mr. Ridley has fairly approached the benchmark comparisons using data from Zimbabwe and South Africa. Even when using a comparison with South Africa (to determine the \"but for\" price) (see Ridley II, para. 10.2, CE-10), Mr. Ridley has taken a modest approach to valuing the Zimbabwean cattle (see *ibid* *..* Table 4, CE-10). However, due to no sales data being present for some of the cattle classes, Mr. Ridley has had to rely on his \"experience and discretion\". For this reason, it may be appropriate to reduce the overall valuation by a modest percentage to recognise this modest level of uncertainty.\n\n823.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation of Forrester Estate as at 30 September 2012 is reasonable and that the von Pezold Claimants have discharged their burden of proof. However, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation should be reduced by 20%. This reduction accounts for the concerns expressed above about some elements of uncertainty in certain parts of the evidence of Messrs Levitt and Ridley, as well as the Respondent\u2019s inability to assist the Tribunal by providing any detailed critiques of Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculations.\n\n824.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the \"but for\" value of the Forrester Estate, including the Forrester Water Permits, is US$39,709,470 (which is 80% of Mr Levitt\u2019s valuation of US$49,636,837).\n\n(iii) Forrester Estate Resitution Shortfall\n-------------------------------------------\n\n825.\n\nThe Tribunal must then consider the Forrester Restitution Shortfall. As the Claimants indicate in their Skeleton Argument (see Cl. Skel., para. 165):\n\nTo calculate the Forrester Restitution Shortfall, Mr Levitt repeated the same DCF plus cattle approach used for his \"but for\" valuation but using the non-adjusted, \"as is\" Inputs. This \"as is\" valuation was then deducted from the \"but for\" valuation to establish the Forrester Restitution Shortfall at 30 September 2012: US$25,453,748.\n\n826.\n\nThus, Mr. Levitt has fixed the Restitution Shortfall of the Forrester Estate at US$25,453,748 by calculating the difference between the \"but for\" value of the Forrester Estate he proposed (US$49,636,837) and his calculation of the Forrester Estate\u2019s \"as is\" value (US$24,183,089).\n\n827.\n\nHaving already accepted Mr. Levitt\u2019s methodology, the Tribunal need only evaluate the inputs used by Mr Levitt to calculate the Forrester Estate\u2019s \"as is\" value.\n\n828.\n\nMr. Levitt notes that in calculating the Restitution Shortfall for the Forrester Estate, \"it is sufficient to simply take the difference between my 2012 valuation... and the equivalent DCF approach based on current revenues and costs\" (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 7.02.3, Corrected CE-7). Further, Mr. Levitt notes (see *ibid* *.,* para. 7.03.2):\n\nI use the current production and cost figures for Forrester Estate. Furthermore, I have calculated the cash flows that would arise from the sale of tobacco and other crops, such as maize, wheat, barley, soya, citrus and peas, based on Forrester Estate\u2019s current operations on the unsettled land amounting to US$22,346,598.\n\n829.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculations. There is a far lesser degree of uncertainty in respect of an \"as is\" valuation, given that the figures relied upon are based on quantifiable, current rates. Therefore, the Tribunal is of the view that Mr. Levitt\u2019s \"as is\" valuation of Forrester Estate of US$22,346,598 (which does not include the value of the cattle) is appropriate. The Discount Rate of 11.10% is, as mentioned above, reasonable.\n\n830.\n\nAs to the valuation of the Forrester cattle, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Ridley\u2019s evidence that the cattle is worth US$1,836,491 (see Ridley II, pp. 8-10, CE-10). As noted, despite the comparisons which have been criticised, the Tribunal is content to accept that Mr. Ridley has done his best with, at times, limited comparative data.\n\n831.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation of the \"as is\" value of Forrester Estate (again including the Forrester Water Permits), along with Mr. Ridley\u2019s cattle valuation83, at US$24,183,089. As Mr. Levitt notes, the von Pezold Claimants will not be completely compensated for their losses in Forrester Estate without receiving compensation for other Heads of Damage, namely the conversion of the Forrester Water Rights to Water Permits, the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall, and the Forrester Conversion Amount (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 7.03.6, Corrected CE-7). Those, however, are distinct from the value of the Restitution Shortfall and are considered separately.\n\nThe \"as is\" value of Forrester Estate of US$24,183,089 is not just Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation, but also Includes Mr Ridley\u2019s cattle valuation.\n\n832.\n\nThe Restitution Shortfall for the Forrester Estate must be calculated with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s adjusted \"but for\" valuation. Having adjusted Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculation at paras. 823-824 above to reach a \"but for\" figure of US$39,709,470, the Tribunal finds that the Restitution Shortfall for Forrester Estate is US$15,526,381 (the difference between the adjusted \"but for\" value of US$39,709,470 and the \"as is\" value of US$24,183,089).\n\ne) Makandi Estate\n-----------------\n\n833.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Parent Claimants indirectly own 50% of four of the local companies within the Makandi Estate, and 44% of a fifth company (see Mem., para. 485). A Norwegian family owns the remaining portion of the companies. The von Pezold Claimants are thus in a joint venture with the Norwegian family in respect of Makandi Estate (see *ibid* *.,* para. 493).\n\n834.\n\nThe Makandi Estate is divided into three sections totalling 8,389 ha, of which 3,625 ha is arable. Those three sections consist of nine properties covered by nine title deeds. The Makandi Estate is a \"mixed plantation, growing coffee, bananas, maize, macadamia nuts, avocados - all under irrigation, except for maize - and timber for the production of transmission poles and firewood\" (see *ibid.* *,* para. 518). The von Pezold Claimants submit that the Makandi Estate remains a thriving going concern. However, six of the nine deeds were expropriated and the remaining properties are unable to operate viably on their own as a mixed plantation (see *ibid* *.,* para. 543). The von Pezold Claimants submit that the remaining assets are worthless without the entire productive assets under their ownership. The Tribunal has also found that the Water Permits attaching to the Makandi Estate, listed in Table 3 of the Claimants\u2019 Reply, were directly expropriated along with the properties.\n\n(iv) Valuation Method for Makandi Estate\n----------------------------------------\n\n835.\n\nAgain, it is necessary to determine first the valuation method to be adopted and, then, to consider the application of that method to the facts in the record. The von Pezold Claimants advocate a comparative market valuation. Mr. Levitt has relied on the evidence of Mr. Stephenson about prices in South Africa, Zambia and Swaziland. Mr. Levitt is of the view there are no suitable comparators in Zimbabwe; the Respondent, and particularly Mr. Moyo, challenges this conclusion of Mr. Levitt (see Resp. PHB, para. 318). Despite the fact that the Makandi Estate is a going concern, the von Pezold Claimants are pursuing a comparative market valuation rather than a DCF analysis.\n\n836.\n\nThe difficulty of using local price comparisons is accepted (that is, comparisons within Zimbabwe). The von Pezold Claimants have made compelling submissions impugning the comparator transactions relied on by Mr. Moyo, as well as his analysis of those transactions (see Cl. PHB, para. 194-195). In addition, it is difficult to achieve a \"but for\" valuation simply by looking at comparative Zimbabwean prices, as those prices are likely to be affected by Zimbabwe\u2019s breaches of the BITs and their long-term consequences. Comparative pricing of land is always a difficult exercise (see *ibid* *.,*see also\u00a0*Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* para. 5.58, CLEX-297), particularly when dealing with a \"but for\" comparison of land.\n\n(v) *Quantum* of Makandi Estate on \"As is\" Basis\n------------------------------------------------\n\n837.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants value the Makandi Estate at US$13,930,012 as at 30 September 2012 (see Cl. Skel., para. 183). Although the von Pezold Claimants have sometimes referred to this as a \"but for\" valuation, it is perhaps more properly considered an \"as is\" valuation (in essence, the \"but for\" value of the Makandi Estate is the \"as is\" value). The von Pezold Claimants have not claimed that the current value of the Makandi Estate should be supplemented on a \"but for\" basis, and accordingly if restitution of the Makandi Estate is made by the Respondent there is no Restitution Shortfall for the Makandi Estate. However, if restitution of the Makandi Estate is not made, then the von Pezold Claimants will be entitled to compensation for the present value of the Makandi Estate.\n\n838.\n\nThe Tribunal has some concerns with Mr. Levitt\u2019s approach in calculating the present value of the Makandi Estate. Inshort, these are:\n\n(a) First, Mr. Stephenson noted in a response to a question by President Fortier that he had not investigated prices of land in Zimbabwe prior to the LRP (see Tr. Day 4, pp. 1055 to 1058). Mr. Stephenson indicated that this was difficult, with detailed information unavailable.\n\n(b) Secondly, it is sensible to question the degree of similarity between Zimbabwe and Mr. Stephenson\u2019s comparator countries, as well as the degree of assistance that can be derived from them. The data pool is reasonably small. For example, there is only one comparator used to value avocado production (see Expert Report of Alan Stephenson, para. 16.3.1.1, CE-4). It is inherently uncertain to take, say, ten properties from a range of neighbouring countries and then simply equate their values with the value of the Makandi Estate. This situation is compounded because in some cases there is no suitable comparator. For example, sugarcane was used by Mr. Stephenson as a comparison to value banana production on the Makandi Estate (see *ibid* *.,* tables 9-10).\n\n(c) Thirdly, Mr. Stephenson appears to have made some arbitrary assumptions. For example, the Tribunal notes the following section of Mr. Stephenson\u2019s Expert Report (see *ibid* *.,* paras. 16.2.2.1-16.2.2.3):\n\nThe comparable sales transactions above show values for bananas, under mlcrojet Irrigation, between R50,000 per hectare and R60,000 per hectare. Bananas under overhead Irrigation were valued at R44,000 per hectare and bananas grown on dry land were valued at R45,000 per hectare. These sales are slightly dated and cognisance of this should be taken into account indetermining the current value of the plantations.\n\nThe banana plantations on the Subject Property are currently grown under mlcrojet and overhead Irrigation and are produced for both the export and the local markets. I would Increase the rate quite significantly in relation to the Subject Property given the dates of sale.\n\nI conclude at the following values for the Irrigated bananas on the Subject Property, as at 30 June 2011:\n\n\u2022 R80,000 per hectare for the mlcrojet Irrigated land under bananas\n\n\u2022 R60,000 per hectare for the overhead Irrigated land under bananas\n\nMr. Stephenson\u2019s significant increase appears rather arbitrary. Referencing \"slightly dated\" sales and different irrigation techniques, Mr. Stephenson makes what can only be an informed guess as to an appropriate price. This is concerning and casts doubt upon Mr. Stephenson\u2019s overall conclusions.\n\n(d) Finally, Mr. Levitt - using Mr. Stephenson\u2019s data - divides the overall valuation of Makandi by half to arrive at the value of the Parent Claimants\u2019 ownership interest. Yet Mr. Levitt acknowledges that this is overly simplistic because only four of the five Makandi companies are half-owned by the Parent Claimants. The Parent Claimants own 44% of the fifth company. No attempt seems to have been made accurately to arrive at the portion of the Makandi Estate\u2019s value actually attributable to the Parent Claimants.\n\n839.\n\nIn light of all these concerns, the Tribunal has difficulty in accepting the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 valuation of the Makandi Estate. But at the same time, the Respondent has not offered a credible alternative. In view of these difficulties, it is appropriate to make an adjustment to the overall sum, although doing so inevitably involves a rough estimate. The Tribunal considers the fairest approach is simply to make a reduction of 20% to mitigate the errors that have inflated the actual value of the Makandi Estate.\n\n840.\n\nIn summary, the ruling of the Tribunal is that Mr. Levitt\u2019s valuation of the Makandi Estate, including the Makandi Water Permits, (US$13,930,012) will still stand, but be reduced by 20% to US$11,144,010. As already noted, there is no Restitution Shortfall to be calculated in respect of the Makandi Estate. If restitution of the Makandi Estate is not provided by the Respondent, however, then the Claimants will be entitled to the value of the Makandi Estate as fixed by the Tribunal at US$11,144,010.\n\nf) Border Estate\n----------------\n\ni) Background\n-------------\n\n841.\n\nThe Tribunal has found it necessary to set out the business background for the Border Estate in more detail than for the other Estates, as the valuation methods submitted by the Claimants here are more complex than for the Forrester or the Makandi Estate. The Claimants value the Border Estate at US$136,228,532 as at 30 September 2012 on a \"but for\" basis (see Cl. Skel., para. 175).\n\n842.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants own 86.49% of the Border Estate (see above para. 127). The Border Estate comprises five sub-estates covering 47,886 ha, of which 31,845 ha is plantable (see Mem., para. 342). The five sub-estates are further divided into 28 Border Properties covered by 11 title deeds. Forestry operations take place on the 28 Border Properties (see Mem., para. 345). Saw milling takes place on three of the properties (see Mem., para. 348). Connected to the Border Estate are a pole treatment plant and two factories, though they are not actually on the sub-estates\u2019 land (see Mem., para. 349). Like the Forrester and Makandi Estates, the Border Estate is said to remain a thriving business and a going concern, although operating at a diminished level due to the Invasions.\n\n843.\n\nThe Claimants describe the Border Estate\u2019s business as vertically integrated. The Border Estate grows pine and eucalyptus, and owns three sawmills, two factories and a pole plant, all of which allow the Border Estate to process its trees without external infrastructure or service providers. For this reason, the Claimants suggest that there is a market in Zimbabwe only for products derived from saw logs, and not for saw logs themselves (see Mem., para. 354).\n\n844.\n\nThe business is said to be sustainable as the planting operation is cyclic: trees are planted, felled, and then re-planted (see Mem., para. 357). The Border Estate\u2019s business practice is to \"sustainably grow as much high-quality timber as possible, and then to realise the value in this timber through process i.e. adding value in its sawmills and factories\" (see Mem., para. 359). Since 1992, the main products of the Border Estate have been: (i) sawn timber (lumber or planks); (ii) creosote treated poles; and (iii) \"value added products\" (such as doors, plywood and the like) (see Mem., para. 360).\n\n845.\n\nBorder Estate\u2019s practice is to ensure there are trees of different ages (different \"age classes\") growing on the plantation at any one time (see Mem., para. 375). Having a diversified age profile of the trees ensures a steady, sustainable revenue flow so long as the age classes are appropriately balanced. This is important as a tree takes between 18 and 25 years to mature \"depending on the species\" (see Mem., para. 376). However, an investment in a single tree tends not to be realised until it is finally cut down and processed many years later. Such a growing time makes the investment vulnerable to intervening factors, such as fire, which prevent a tree\u2019s value from being realised. Again, as the Claimants submit, this means that the value of the Border Estate cannot be determined by the felled value of every tree at a single time (see Mem., para. 377).\n\n846.\n\nAs to its market, the Claimants contend that the Border Estate products are in \"high demand\" and sell both domestically and globally \"as demand dictates\" (see Mem., para. 361). Claiming that fires caused by Settlers/War Veterans have decreased Border Estate\u2019s ability to supply markets in the U.K., U.S. and Korea, the Claimants aver that most of their exports are now within Africa (see Mem., paras. 364-370)84.\n\nThe Border Estate apparently exported 80% of its products In 2008/2009 but has decreased that proportion to 50% today.\n\n847.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, due to fires and settler activity, the Border Estate has a disproportionately high number of young trees and a disproportionately low number of older trees. This, the Claimants say, has meant fewer saw logs are being processed. In turn, this has kept the processing infrastructure below capacity.\n\n848.\n\nOverall, Mr. Levitt has calculated the Total Potential Plantable Area of the Border Estate at 32,294 ha (discussed below). Of this, 24,367 ha is planted; 3,954 ha is temporarily unplanted; and 3,973 ha is settler-occupied. Mr. Levitt contends that while normally the Border Estate aims to keep 5% of the Total Planted Area as Temporary Unplanted Area, this proportion is currently exceeded as there are 7,927 ha of unplanted area vis-\u00e0-vis 24,637 ha of planted area. This unplanted area is said to be made up of land occupied by Settlers/War Veterans and damaged by fire (caused by Settlers/War Veterans). These numbers are based on 2005 data.\n\n849.\n\nThe structure of the Estate vis-\u00e0-vis its tree growing is also relevant. First, the Border Estate\u2019s five sub-estates are arranged into Compartments. A Compartment is a group of trees of a similar age class. Next, there is a Stand, which is a sub-Compartment, with trees uniform in species, age, and condition. Finally, there is a working circle, where trees are normally grown for the same purpose (such as pine saw logs). This data is then stored in Microforest. Microforest has a module called Plantation Manager, which stores this data to Compartment level and records metrics such as age, class, species, annual increase in volume, and others. There is also a module called Harvesting Scheduling System, which uses data from Plantation Manager to advise on techniques, such as thinning, for increasing or maximising timber output down to Working Circle level.\n\n850.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that 21 of the 28 Border Estate properties have been expropriated, as well as the sawmills. It is the Claimants\u2019 view that, without all the assets under ownership, the Border Estate is effectively worthless if sold.\n\nii) Valuation Method for Border Estate\n--------------------------------------\n\n851.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Border Estate should be valued in two ways: (i) a comparative market approach for the land; and (ii) a fair market approach for the timber, based on three valuation methods. In respect of the timber, the valuation method depends on the age of the trees being valued: (i) for the least mature trees, an Accumulated Current Actual Cost (ACAC) basis; (ii) for the overmature trees, an actual felling price; and (iii) for the trees between those two ages, a valuation based on the Faustmann Formula.\n\n852.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees. Mr. Moyo has again used DRC and comparative market approaches. Mr. Moyo appears to have valued the Border Estate by valuing the land separately from the assets (subsuming timber within the land valuation). Mr. Kanyekanye has instead advocated a market capitalisation valuation based on the listed price of the Border Estate on the Zimbabwean Stock Exchange.\n\n853.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to derive any assistance from Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s proposed valuation and accepts the Claimants\u2019 criticisms on this aspect (see Cl. PHB, para. 206). The vast majority of the Border Estate shares are owned by the Claimants, leaving a very small, illiquid portion traded on the Zimbabwean Stock Exchange. More fundamentally, the Stock Exchange only offers an \"as is\", rather than a \"but for\" valuation. Accordingly, the listed price is inappropriate unless it were subsequently adjusted on a \"but for\" basis. Finally, market capitalisation poorly captures an investment\u2019s future return. Those future returns are important given that the Border Estate relies on trees to mature before realising its investments. Since the Estate currently has a disproportional number of young trees, this expected future return is unlikely to be reflected in a capitalisation valuation.\n\n854.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unpersuaded by Mr. Moyo\u2019s approach. His comparative market approach seems to be lacking in data (three properties are used) and does not seem to have been adjusted to reflect \"but for\" value. Further, the Claimant has challenged the reliability of those three transactions, claiming they were not arms-length transactions. Inrespect of the DRC approach, as found earlier by the Tribunal, it is unsuitable fora going concern. The unsuitability of these methods is compounded by Mr. Moyo\u2019s decision to value the Border Estate\u2019s land and assets separately, without actually considering the trees as a separate class of asset worthy of an industry-specific valuation. Since most of the Border Estate\u2019s value derives from the forestry operation, Mr. Moyo\u2019s approach is therefore deficient and unhelpful85.\n\nA more detailed criticism of the above approaches is outlined in Mr. Levitt\u2019s First Expert Report at Sections 14.03.9 - 14.03.12.\n\n855.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is left with the Claimants\u2019 approach, with which it agrees in principle. The Claimants have adopted a realistic approach to valuing the Border Estate, particularly regarding the value of the trees.\n\n*iii) Quantum* of Border Estate on a \"But For\" Basis\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n856.\n\nThe Claimants value the Border Estate at US$136,228,532 as at 30 September 2012 on a \"but for\" basis (see Cl. Skel., para. 175). This sum is derived from two separate valuations: forestry (US$97,771,263), and land and roads (US$38,457,269) (see Second Export Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 5.05.27, Corrected CE-7).\n\n857.\n\nThe Tribunal must accordingly evaluate the appropriateness of the Claimants\u2019 valuation methods as applied to the Border Estate. Mr. Levitt undertook his valuation as follows (see First Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 14.04.2, Corrected CE-1):\n\nThe value of the trees by reference to a combined Faustmann/ACAC calculation as explained in paragraph 6.08.15 et seq, which is a DCF based approach and not by reference to cost or a valuation prepared for year-end accounting or some other purpose;\n\nthe value of the land and roads making up the Border Estate, by reference to a professional valuation specifically for the purposes of this dispute. This value is both:\n\na. an Input to the Faustmann calculation; and also\n\nb. added to the value of the plantations.\n\n858.\n\nFor completeness, the Tribunal sets out a comprehensive explanation of Mr. Levitt\u2019s approach, as summarized in the Claimant\u2019s Skeleton Argument (see Cl. Skel., paras. 173-175):\n\n173. ***Border issue 2:*** By way of summary, the Faustmann Formula employed by Mr Levitt allows a valuer to derive the Internal rate of return (\"IRR\") for a particular working circle (I.e. the Pine Sawlog, Eucalyptus Sawlog and Eucalyptus Pole working circles) using the Information that is readily known: specifically, the thinnings Income and net standing value at clearfelling, the costs associated with the ownership or operation of the plantation (whether owned or rented), the costs associated with each silvicultural process, the annual overhead costs, and the clearfelllng rotation age. The IRR in the case of a specific working circle is the discount rate at which the net present value of the running costs (I.e. the silviculture, annual overhead and \"land rental\" costs) equals the net present value of the Income generated from the full rotation (I.e. from thinnings and clearfelllng). Mr Levitt has used the Faustmann Formula to derive the IRR for each working circle and then used these IRRs to calculate the standing value per ha for all the age classes within each of Border\u2019s three working circles. These values were then applied to the Estate\u2019s \"but for\" age class distribution to establish the value of the majority of the on-rotation trees.\n\n174. Since the values produced by the Faustmann Formula for the least mature trees are lower than the actual costs that have been Incurred growing them, these stands were valued based on their actual growing costs as stated incurrent cost terms (I.e. an ACAC approach). Since the value in the overmature trees could be realised Immediately, Mr Levitt has valued them separately based on their actual current felling values.\n\n175. Mr Levitt\u2019s total standing timber value is the sum of the Faustmann Formula-derived values for the majority of the on rotation trees, added to the valuation of the overmature stands and the ACAC valuation of the least Immature stands. This figure was added to the comparable transaction-based value of Border\u2019s land and roads to arrive at Mr Levitt\u2019s \"but for\" Fair Market Value valuation of the Border Estate: US$136,228,532 at 30 September 2012, and US$104,937,069 at 13 September 2005. [references omitted]\n\n859.\n\nMr. Levitt\u2019s forestry calculations go to the forestry valuation, which accounts for US$97,771,263 of Border Estate\u2019s value (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, schedule 10.2, Corrected CE-7).\n\n860.\n\nThe Respondent challenged two main inputs used by Mr. Levitt: (i) the NSV of fully mature pine; and (ii) the Border Estate\u2019s plantation area and age class profile (see Resp. PHB, para. 20.1.1 ff). Generally, the Respondent opines that the Claimants have inflated the price at sale, ignored lower timber prices, ignored more comparable timber prices, and oversimplified the pricing by not including unproductive timber used for wind breaks and not varying price to reflect the type of wood (or maturity or size).\n\n861.\n\nMr. Levitt responded to these critiques in his Second Report (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 2.04.87, Corrected CE-7). Mr. Levitt uses a roadside price of $40/m3 (where the seller takes the cost of harvest and extraction). The costs of harvest and extraction are then subtracted from the roadside price to arrive at the NSV, which Mr. Levitt puts at $26.3/m3 (in other words, the cost estimate was $13.7/m3).\n\n862.\n\nIt is not difficult to see some merit in the Respondent\u2019s criticism that the roadside price is based on limited evidence. Mr. Levitt, for example, derived the $40/m3 figure from two sources (see *ibid* *.,* para. 2.04.88, Corrected CE-7). The first was a quote from another Zimbabwean company from 2010. The second was a single contract between the Border Estate and Mutare Board and Paper Mill from 2012. To then take $40/m3 as a definitive market price seems questionable to the Tribunal. Inevitably though, as with the land, comparisons are always going to be flawed. The Tribunal notes, however, that Mr. Levitt has decreased the valuation of the timber by approximately $20 million for his second valuation to reflect contemporary conditions on the Estate. On the whole, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Levitt acted fairly and that his valuation is reasonable.\n\n863.\n\nFinally, in the view of the Tribunal, Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s proposed NSV, of $6.67/m3 is indeed tantamount to \"economic suicide\", as the Claimants suggest. Further, the Claimants contend that if Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s calculation excludes the cost of transport to South Africa, the NSV is actually around $35/m3, which is not very different from the figure proposed by Mr. Levitt.\n\n864.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not seriously challenged the Claimants\u2019 NSV, although it acknowledges that there is some doubt as to whether it may be too generous. Accordingly, the Tribunal will factor in an overall deduction of the valuation to counteract any such \"generosity\".\n\n865.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent attacks Mr. Levitt\u2019s plantation area and age class profiles. Mr. Kanyekanye alleges that Mr. Levitt\u2019s data is speculative. It seems that these criticisms are based not on the application of the Faustmann Formula but rather on the data entered into the Formula. The experts for the Claimants have confirmed that they have not used Microforest\u2019s forecasting or speculation modules. Rather, the data relied on is the data entered into the programme that has been collected from surveying the Border Estate. The only adjustment the Claimants\u2019 experts have made was to account for \"the effect of the Settlers\". Therefore, the Tribunal accepts that the data entered into Microforest, which Mr. Levitt relied upon, is reliable.\n\n866.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that overall Mr. Levitt has undertaken a rigorous and reasonable analysis using the Faustmann Formula. The reliability of Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculation is supported by the following summation given in the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, which the Tribunal finds to be persuasive (see Cl. PHB, para. 214):\n\nMr. Levitt begins with the actual Estate as recorded in the Microforest database and then adds the area that would have been planted at Sawerombi but for the activities of Settlers, which is the only adjustment to the overall area of the Estate. Mr. Levitt also makes two \"but for\" age class adjustments (i.e. Increasing the number of older trees and making corresponding decreases in the number of younger trees): (1) the first reflects the trees that were burnt by Settler-caused fires and therefore would have been on the Estate \"but for\" the effects of Settlers; and (2) the second reflects the fact that management would have planted the Temporarily Un-Planted compartments \"but for\" the effects of Settlers such that there is only 5% of the plantable area unplanted rather than the actual, higher figure. Finally, since baboon damage is not reflected in the Microforest data, Mr. Levitt makes an \"as is\" age class adjustment to reflect such damage which affects the yield of timber from the Estate. Mr. Kanyekanye\u2019s evidence and the Respondent\u2019s cross-examination of Mr. Bottger suggests that it did not appreciate that Mr. Levitt has specifically taken baboon damage into account in his valuation; for the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Levitt has taken baboon damage into account and the effect of this adjustment is to reduce his valuation.\n\n867.\n\nOne concern of the Tribunal relates to Mr. Levitt\u2019s adjustment to consider the \"but for\" planting area. inarriving at this figure, Mr. Levitt has relied on the Claimants\u2019 business plan. For example, Sawerombi was to have 5,500 ha planted by 2003 but this was inhibited by settler activity. So Mr. Levitt relied on 5,500 ha as the area that would have been planted \"but for\" the Respondent\u2019s breaches. Further, Mr. Levitt assumes that Settlers/War Veterans caused all the fires between 2002 to 2012, with the exception of an estimated 50 ha of unrelated fires per year and 1,000 ha lost in 2010 from non-settler causes. Inarriving at the above figures, Mr. Levitt is obviously making estimates, which involve some degree of speculation. However, as the Tribunal noted earlier, this is the ongoing difficulty that must be faced with the \"but for\" evaluation. The Tribunal concludes that it is reasonable to accept the estimated 5,500 ha. In the past, the Claimants have operated these Estates efficiently and the Tribunal does not find that their business plans are unduly optimistic or speculative.\n\n868.\n\nMr. Levitt inserted the value of the underlying lands and roads, which accounts for US$38,457,269 of Border Estate\u2019s value, into his valuation model. The actual valuation of the land and roads was conducted by Mr. Stephenson, who also valued the Makandi Estate\u2019s land (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 5.05.28, Corrected CE-7). The Tribunal finds the general concerns expressed about the valuation of the Makandi Estate\u2019s land at para. 839 above also apply here. Namely, Mr. Stephenson\u2019s valuation of Border Estate\u2019s land suffers from a relatively small number of comparative land transactions, and those transactions mostly involve land in South Africa (see, e.g. Fourth Expert Report of Alan Stephenson, CE-08, paras. 21-25). Nevertheless, any uncertainty is resolved by applying a margin of appreciation to the overall valuation of Border Estate.\n\n869.\n\nThe Tribunal finds therefore that the integrity of Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculations for the value of the Border Estate has been established. However, as a response to any concerns as to the reliability of some estimated data, the Tribunal will reduce the overall valuation by 20%. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the \"but for\" value of the Border Estate is US$108,982,826 (which is 80% of US$136,228,532).\n\niv) Restitution Shortfall for Border Estate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n870.\n\nMr. Levitt determined that there would be no difference between the land and roads of the Border Estate as calculated on a \"but for\" basis and an \"as is\" basis. That is because, Mr. Levitt says, \"the value of the land and roads is the same as it would have been in the event that the Border Properties had not been expropriated\" (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 7.02.6, Corrected CE-7). Accordingly, the only relevant calculation to determine the Restitution Shortfall for the Border Estate is to calculate the difference between the \"but for\" value of the Border forestry assets and the \"as is\" value of those same forestry assets. Mr. Levitt\u2019s \"but for\" value of the Border forestry assets without the land and roads is, as noted above, US$97,771,263 (now discounted by the Tribunal by 20% to US$78,217,010). Mr. Levitt calculated the \"as is\" value of the forestry assets of the Border Estate at US$64,011,909. Mr. Levitt employed the same valuation methodology to determine the \"as is\" value of the Border forestry assets as he used to calculate their \"but for\" value - only the inputs have changed (see Cl. Skel., para. 178).\n\n871.\n\nMr. Levitt\u2019s valuation is based on the current state of the Border Estate\u2019s trees as quantified in Microforest. The Tribunal accepts that Mr. Levitt has undertaken a reasonable valuation of the Border Estate\u2019s forestry assets. As the \"but for\" value is reduced to account for a margin of appreciation, the overall Restitution Shortfall will also be reduced in any event.\n\n872.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the Restitution Shortfall for the Border Estate, deducting the \"as is\" value of the forestry assets (US$64,011,909) from the adjusted \"but for\" value of the forestry assets (US$78,217,010), to be US$14,205,101.\n\ng) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion on *Quantum* for the Estates\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n873.\n\nIt is useful to summarise the above findings on the value of the Estates.\n\n874.\n\nIf the Respondent does perform restitution, then the Claimants are entitled to return of legal title to the Zimbabwean Properties, as well as the following Restitution Shortfalls based on the difference between the adjusted \"but for\" valuations and the \"as is\" valuations:\n\n(a) Forrester Estate: US$15,526,38186;\n\n(b) Makandi Estate: no Restitution Shortfall sought87; and\n\n(c) Border Estate: US$14,205,101.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\n875.\n\nIf the Respondent does not perform restitution, then the Claimants are entitled to compensation based on the following \"but for\" valuations of the Estates:\n\n(a) Forrester Estate: US$39,709,47088;\n\n(b) Makandi Estate: US$11,144,01089; and\n\n(c) Border Estate: US$108,982,826.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\n876.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants have requested that restitution be effected by the Respondent within 45 days of the dispatch of the Tribunal\u2019s award (the **\"Restitution Window\").** The Tribunal considers that this Restitution Window is too short. Consequently, the Tribunal will grant the Respondent 90 days to effect restitution in full.\n\n877.\n\nIn addition, if the Respondent does not effect restitution within the Restitution Window, the Claimants request that, in the alternative, compensation be paid by the Respondent within 60 days of the dispatch of the Tribunal\u2019s award. In the opinion of the Tribunal, this time line is also too short. In that eventuality, the Tribunal will grant the Respondent 120 days from the date of the dispatch of the Tribunal\u2019s award to pay to the Claimants the compensation ordered by the Tribunal.\n\nh) Zimbabwean Company Shares\n----------------------------\n\n878.\n\nThe Claimants contend that (see Cl. PHB, para. 224):\n\n[T]he diminution in value of the share capital of the Zimbabwean Companies is equivalent to their lost interest in the expropriated assets; it appears that the Respondent has accepted this position.\n\n879.\n\nIndeed, and as noted earlier90, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial, wrote (see CM. para. 151):\n\nThe acquisition of the income producing assets of the Forrester companies, the Border companies and the Makandi companies through the Constitutional Amendment inevitably means that the shares are affected but that has been factored Into the valuation for compensation.\n\nSee above at para. 784.\n\n880.\n\nAccordingly, the Zimbabwean Companies\u2019 share capital is directly related to the value of the Estates, which are the Companies\u2019 only assets (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 1.02, Corrected CE-7). This also means that restitution of the Estates and/or compensation will compensate the Claimants for the loss in value of their shares. If restitution of the Estates is made, the Zimbabwean Companies\u2019 shares will increase in value. On the other hand, if compensation is paid, the Claimants will benefit as the owners of the Estates. There is therefore no need for the Tribunal to award damages separately under this head of damage. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that any challenge by the Respondent in respect of the *quantum* of damages pertaining to the shares will relate to the valuations of the Estates, which has been dealt with above.\n\ni) Other Heads of Damage\n------------------------\n\n881.\n\nThe Claimants seek remedies for what they characterize as \"remaining heads of loss\". The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not addressed the calculation of these remedies in any comprehensive way.\n\ni) Seized Maize\n---------------\n\n882.\n\nThe Respondent expropriated 4,500 tonnes of the von Pezold Claimant\u2019s maize although, at the time, some money was paid for the maize (see Cl. Skel., para. 111). However, the von Pezold Claimants contend that there was a shortfall of US$317,405 between the compensation received and the market price at the time (see *ibid* *.,* para. 166). Mr. Levitt attempts to justify this claim as follows (see First Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 5.04.6, CE-1):\n\nin January 2002, the Grain Marketing Board seized 6,000 tonnes of maize from Forrester. Forrester negotiated with the GMB whereby the GMB would buy 4,500 tonnes of the seized maize from Forrester for ZIM$15,000 per tonne. At the time the average market price was ZIM$37,571. The remaining 1,500 tonnes remained on Forrester Estate and was used to feed the workforce.\n\n883.\n\nMr. Levitt refers to the evidence of Heinrich, who submitted in his Witness Statement that \"the market price per tonne was Z$37,571,004\" (see Heinrich I, para. 565, C-18). The Tribunal is not satisfied that the von Pezold Claimants have discharged their burden of proof with this mere statement. This claimed head of damage is therefore dismissed.\n\nii) Forrester Loans\n-------------------\n\n884.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the failure by the Respondent to allow the Forrester Loans to be repaid to Elisabeth breached the Respondent\u2019s FET, non-imapairment and FTP obligations. As to *quantum,* Mr. Levitt quantified the damages at US$7,186,302 for the principal with interest, as at the date of the breach on 31 December 2001 (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 4.08.6, Corrected CE-7). The Tribunal upholds this claim in favor of Elisabeth. Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculated sum shall be awarded as damages.\n\niii) Forrester Water Rights\n---------------------------\n\n885.\n\nAs noted above, the conversion of the Forrester Water Rights into Water Permits in 2000 represents a distinct head of damage. In this respect, based on the actual water levies charged to the von Pezold Claimants by the Respondent (the former Forrester Water Rights, it will be recalled, did not require payment of levies), the von Pezold Claimants calculate a loss of US$106,273 between 2009 and 2011 (despite the conversion in 2000, levies were not regularly charged until 2009: see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 4.11.3, Corrected CE-7). To calculate the full and final damages suffered by the von Pezold Claimants in respect of the conversion of the Forrester Water Rights, Mr. Levitt calculated an average annual levy (based on the 2009-2011 data), and then calculated the cost of those levies in perpetuity. The total loss under this head is, according to the von Pezold Claimants, US$425,412.\n\n886.\n\nAlthough there is minimal data to average the annual levy (only three years) and the sums fluctuate considerably (low of US$18,904; high of US$57,834), the Tribunal finds that the von Pezold Claimants have met their burden of proof on the balance of probabilities.\n\n887.\n\nThe Tribunal has found an FET breach by the Respondent in respect of the Forrester Water Rights, but not an expropriation. Although Mr. Levitt\u2019s *quantum* calcuations for the Forrester Water Rights are based on expropriation rather than FET breach, the Tribunal has nevertheless determined that it is appropriate to accept Mr. Levitt\u2019s calculation of damages. The damage to the von Pezold Claimants is the same in either case: the Respondent failed to compensate the von Pezold Claimants for their loss when the Water Rights were converted into Water Permits in 2001, affecting both their duration and the Respondent\u2019s ability to charge levies. Accordingly, damages of US$425,412 shall be awarded to the von Pezold Claimants in respect of the Forrester Water Rights.\n\niv) Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall\n-------------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nThe background of this head of damage was explained by the Claimants as follows (see Cl. Skel., paras. 121 and 169):\n\nBetween 2004 and 2008, the Respondent priced tobacco sales in US Dollars, but paid the von Pezold Claimants in Zimbabwean Dollars at the Official Rate, which grossly overvalued the Zimbabwean Dollar (see para 100 above). Accordingly the Respondent directly expropriated the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 proceeds from the tobacco sales and paid them Inadequate compensation based on Official Rates. The loss is the difference between the US Dollar sale price at the Official Rate and the US Dollar sale price at the Unofficial Rate (\"the Tobacco Value Shortfall\"). Alternatively, through the same process, the Respondent directly expropriated the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 tobacco (\"the Forrester Tobacco\").\n\n\u2026\n\nTo calculate the loss, Mr Levitt began by extracting from the tobacco sales sheets the Gross Sale value in Zimbabwean dollars, the Zimbabwean dollar to US dollar conversion rate that was applied to the sale, and the value of any subsidy payment that was made. He used this data to calculate the US dollar price that was paid by the purchaser, which enabled him to calculate the difference between the Zimbabwean dollars that would have been received had the sale been converted at a proper exchange rate (I.e. the Black Market Rate), and the Zimbabwean dollars that were actually received. He then deducted any subsidy paid to Border from this loss and converted the post-subsidy loss back to US dollars using the Black Market Rate applicable on the date of sale. The total loss at 2005 was US$2,815,253, and at 2009 was US$10,085,598.\n\n889.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the Respondent\u2019s manipulation of its foreign exchange rates amounted to a breach of the FET, non-impairment and FTP standards. The Tribunal recognizes that quantifying these damages is not easy, as there are some quite complex data sets in use including, for example, official and parallel (black market) exchange rates. Nevertheless, having examined the evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Levitt has taken into account the available data on exchange rates and used it in a reasonable way (see First Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 10.05.9, CE-1). The claim is accordingly allowed in favour of the von Pezold Claimants. Therefore, the von Pezold Claimants are entitled to US$10,085,598 in respect of the Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall.\n\nv) Forrester Conversion Amount\n------------------------------\n\n890.\n\nDuring the 2008 tobacco selling season, the von Pezold Claimants contend that they were required by the Respondent to retain 25% of the sale proceeds of tobacco in a foreign currency account (see First Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 10.02.1, CE-1). As noted earlier in this Award, the Respondent refused to allow those funds to be withdrawn.\n\n891.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the funds were subject to a breach of the FET, non-impairment and FTP standards by the Respondent and the von Pezold Claimants are entitled to recover them. As to the amount, the von Pezold Claimants claim US$1,409,148 (see *ibid.* *,* para. 10.02.4), whereas the Respondent has submitted that the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 loss amounts to US$1,331,176.90 (see the evidence at C-154). Mr. Levitt asked the Respondent to explain this deficiency but never received a reply (see First Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 10.02.5, CE-1). Mr. Levitt has provided persuasive evidence to support the amount of US$1,409,148 and the Tribunal accepts it.\n\nvi) Border Liquidation Shortfall\n--------------------------------\n\n892.\n\nThe Border Liquidation Shortfall relates to the Respondent\u2019s requirement that between 2004 and 2009 the Claimants sell a percentage of their US Dollar Border Estate export earnings for a purportedly equivalent amount of Zimbabwean Dollars based on Official Rates (see Cl. Skel., para. 123). The Tribunal has found that the Respondent\u2019s treatment of exchange rates was a breach of FET, non-impairment and FTP.\n\n893.\n\nThe von Pezold Claimants contend that the damages for the forced Border Estate export earnings is the \"difference between the US Dollar sale price at Official Rates, and the US Dollar sale price at Unofficial Rates\" (see Cl. Skel., para. 123). Mr. Levitt notes that from 2003 to 2009, there was an increasing disparity between the official exchange rate and the parallel (black market) exchange rate (see First Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 10.06.1, CE-1). Mr. Levitt has calculated the loss to the von Pezold Claimants at US$14,957,864 (see Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 7.03.11(i), Corrected CE-7). Again, assessing the reasonableness *of quantum* is markedly more complicated for losses tied to exchange rates. However, the Tribunal accepts the reasonable approach taken by Mr. Levitt and awards US$14,957,864 in respect of the Border Liquidation Shortfall.\n\nvii) Border Forex Losses\n------------------------\n\n894.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that any direct withdrawals by the Respondent from the Border accounts amounted to direct expropriations. The withdrawals totalled US$100,533 (see Heinrich I, para. 845, C-18; and Second Expert Report of Anthony Levitt, para. 9.06.5, Corrected CE-7).\n\n895.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the evidence of Heinrich von Pezold on this point and awards to the Claimants the sum of US$100,533.\n\nviii) Conclusion on Heads of Damages\n------------------------------------\n\n896.\n\nIt is again useful to summarise the Tribunal\u2019s findings on the above Heads of Damage:\n\n(a) Forrester Loans: US$7,186,302;91\n\n(b) Forrester Water Rights: US$425,412;92\n\n(c) Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall: US$10,085,598;93\n\n(d) Forrester Conversion Amount: US$1,409,148;94\n\n(e) Border Liquidation Shortfall: US$14,957,864; and\n\n(f) Border Forex Losses: US$100,533.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\nThis relief relates only to the claims brought by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\n(5) Moral Damages\n-----------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n897.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that moral damages should only be paid in exceptional circumstances for non-material injury to the victim and his or her family where the cause and effect is grave or substantial. The Claimants refer to Heinrich\u2019s evidence in particular in regard to the threats and violence that has been \"meted out to them and their staff by Settlers\", which the Claimants say establish the necessary elements for the award of moral damages. The Claimants also contend that they have established that the acts of the Settlers/War Veterans are attributable to the Respondent. The Claimants submit that, alternatively, even if the acts of the Settlers/War Veterans are not attributable to the Respondent, this does not prevent the acts of Settlers/War Veterans giving rise to a breach of the FET and FPS standards by the Respondent for which moral damages should be awarded (see Cl. PHB, para. 183).\n\n898.\n\nHeinrich\u2019s Witness Statements provide much of the evidence supporting moral damages. At a general level, Heinrich notes that (see Heinrich I, paras. 591-594):\n\n591. During the Invasions, I along with my staff, were humiliated, threatened with death and assaulted, had firearms put to our heads, and were kidnapped.... These experiences were terrifying, as we did not know in the heat of the moment whether the War Veterans merely want to harass us, assault us, or kill us. Furthermore, even If the Intention was the former, despite being humiliating, things could have gone unintentionally wrong, more so because firearms were often involved, as they were on a number of occasions....\n\n592. The sense of terror was heightened by the fact that the Police in most instances were not willing to protect us - we were left to fend for ourselves against the mobs of Settlers and War Veterans.\n\n593. It was not only the members of staff who were directly assaulted that were left traumatised; those of our staff who witnessed their family members and colleagues being beaten and humiliated by War Veterans during the Invasions also suffered trauma.\n\n594. Beyond the actual terror of experiencing an Invasion first-hand, during the Invasions there was a general sense of terror within the farming community; we knew that farmers and farm workers had been killed during Invasions by War Veterans, and that there were a number of Instances of rape and threats of rape on the farms by War Veterans. Mr Charles Laurie provides a chilling account of the extent of the rapes....\n\n899.\n\nHeinrich further provides a number of more specific, detailed instances of violence and threatening behaviour. Two particular examples are provided below in orderto highlight the treatment suffered by Heinrich personally (see *ibid* *.Y*\n\n616. E Section (Forrester Estate \"B\" of Umvukwe Estate) - in the afternoon of 13 April 2000, while I toured the farm with a journalist from the German magazine Der Stern, the Settlers stole the journalist\u2019s camera, tied me up, and threatened to kill me. Mr Hamilton and my cousin freed me by driving a truck at the Settlers, and the workers chased the Settlers away. On the same day, Settlers kidnapped the seventy-year-old uncle of the E Section assistant manager, tortured him, and then released him the same day. On 29 April 2000, War Veterans, Messrs Maguti and Makaya (who worked for the government body, Agritex), arrived on E Section and started beating the workers. They forced all of the workers to sit in a circle and sing slogans, then asked the Settlers which of the workers were MDC supporters. The Settlers identified a Mr Samson (a Forrester Estate employee at the time) and beat him until he pointed out other supposed MDC supporters. They next forced Mr de Villiers (the E section manager at the time), an Afrikaner (a white African of Dutch descent), to sing derogatory songs about Afrikaners, then beat him, threatened to kill him, and told him they would \"share [his] wife\" with them. Messrs Maguti and Makaya then stole a car and used it for the invasion of other farms.\n\n\u2026\n\n622. J Section (Frogmore Extension) - Late in October 2002, thirty people arrived on J Section and abducted me, spiriting me away to the local ZANU-PF headquarters in Nzvimbo where I was held for four hours. While I was being transported to the local ZANU-PF headquarters, the abductors tried to hit me, but Mr Chihota (a Forrester Estate employee) bravely interposed himself between me and the assailants, shielding me from their blows. During my detention at ZANU-PF headquarters, the abductors told me to stop relying on the courts and to go back to Britain. When I advised them that I was German, they told me to go back to Germany. I was eventually released on the orders of higher authority.\n\n900.\n\nThe evidence of the remaining von Pezold Claimants can be found in their respective Witness Statements. For the most part, each witness statement provides similar evidence about the circumstances on which they base their claim for moral damages. For example, George von Pezold\u2019s Witness Statement contains the following (at paras. 14-15):\n\n14. During the aggressive phases of the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme, I was aware of the constant dangers faced by Heinrich. I was informed by Heinrich and my parents that he, along with our staff, had been attacked and humiliated on numerous occasions. The dangers faced by Heinrich and our staff made me feel anxious and distressed.\n\n15. My distress was heightened by the fact that the Police - as I understood from Heinrich - were unwilling to protect him and our staff against the Invasions and harassment by the Settlers.\n\n901.\n\nThe evidence of the remaining von Pezold Claimants is largely consistent because, while Heinrich was in Zimbabwe, the other von Pezolds were not. Accordingly, the stress and trauma they experienced was very much based on their concern for Heinrich and their staff. They were not personally exposed to any threats or violence.\n\n902.\n\nHeinrich also describes some of the incidents that occurred at the Border Estate. For example, two of the more violent situations are reproduced below (see Heinrich I, paras. 665, 675):\n\n665. Sawerombi Estate - in November 2000, nine Border Estate employees were confronted by approximately thirty-three Settlers. The Settlers proclaimed the area belonged to the Chikukwa tribe and that the Border Estate should not be working in the area. The Settlers proceeded to assault two of the Border Estate\u2019s employees, one of whom was Cannais Semwayo. Mr Semwayo was beaten with rocks and sticks, and as a result of his injuries was unable to work for three weeks.\n\n\u2026\n\n675. On 11 November 2005, a Border security guard, Fungai Nhondera, was assigned to guard a Border Estate truck that had broken down whilst carrying timber from the Charter sawmill. The District Administrator, Smart Chindawande, and five other men, including a uniformed Police officer, arrived at the broken down truck, and questioned Mr Nhondera as to why he was guarding the truck. The District Administrator ordered the men accompanying him to puncture all of the tyres on the Border Estate\u2019s truck, and then burn the truck. The men initially protested, but eventually they slashed the truck\u2019s tyres. The District Administrator thereafter pulled out a gun and pointed it at Mr Nhonderan and ordered him to remain where he was. The men who accompanied the District Administrator told him not to shoot Mr Nhondera but suggested that they beat him to death. The District Administrator took Mr Nhondera\u2019s baton and hit him over the head with it. Mr Nhondera passed out, and was unconscious for approximately twenty to thirty minutes. Once Mr Nhondera regained consciousness, he crawled into the nearest bush that he could find for his own safety.\n\n903.\n\nThe examples provided above simply demonstrate the kind of conduct that the Claimants rely on to justify the award of moral damages.\n\n904.\n\nAlso relevant to the Border Claimants is the evidence of John Gadzikwa, the former Managing Director of Border Timbers Limited between 2000 and 2009. Mr. Gadzlkwa\u2019s evidence is not as detailed as that of Heinrich\u2019s but provides a general description of the events at Border that are said to justify moral damages (see Gadzikwa I, paras. 11-12):\n\n11. The Settlers also directly interfered with the Border Estate's staff. Roadblocks, manned by Settlers were set up and were used to prevent our staff from entering particular areas of the Border Estate. Settlers confronted and threatened employees who were carrying out operations on the Border Estate.\n\n12. The effect of Settler activity on our staff was that they became reluctant to enter the areas which were illegally occupied by Settlers. This directly affected the planting, pruning and felling of trees in those areas, and indirectly affected the quantity of timber that was readily available for processing in the Border Estate's sawmills.\n\n905.\n\nThe sums sought for moral damages by the Claimants differ according to the particular claimant: Heinrich seeks US$5,000,000; the remaining von Pezold Claimants seek US$1,000,000 each; and the Border Claimants seek US$5,000,000. Collectively, the Claimants seek US$17,000,000 in moral damages (of which US$12,000,000 is attributed to the von Pezold Claimants, and US$5,000,000 to the Border Claimants).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n906.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimants are entitled to moral damages, and notes that the amount claimed by Heinrich (i.e., US$5,000,000) is comparable to the loans used to Invest in the properties more than a decade ago. Should any moral damages be awarded, the Respondent asks that they be greatly reduced to be symbolic in nature (see Rejoinder, para. 20.1.7).\n\n907.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the \"the Claimants have presented insufficient proof to justify the claim for moral damages\" as the Claimants\u2019 rely on \"Heinrich\u2019s say so\" (see CM, para. 165). Further, the Respondent instead seeks to distance its responsibility for the actions of the Settlers/War Veterans said to give rise to moral damages. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent (see CM, para. 161):\n\n[D]enies that the actions of the settlers, invaders and war veterans be attributed to it. If the violations complained of did occur at all, Respondent avers that these were not sanctioned by the State but were actions of opportunist criminals who took advantage of the situation.\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\na) Legal background\n-------------------\n\n908.\n\nA State\u2019s obligation to provide reparation for an \"injury\" may include moral damage, as well as material damage (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 202, CLEX-272). The commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility recognises that moral damages include \"such things as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one\u2019s home or private life\" (see *ibid.)* *.* Nevertheless, moral damages will be awarded only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n909.\n\nMoral damages are relatively new to investment treaty arbitration although they have been awarded, especially in respect of \"pain and suffering and other affronts to personality\" (see Sabahi, p. 191, CLEX-306). The ICSID tribunal in *Lemire* outlined the circumstances necessary to award moral damages in an investment treaty dispute. After reviewing authorities on moral damages, the Tribunal concluded that \"moral damages can be awarded in exceptional cases, provided that\" (see\u00a0*Lemire,* para. 333, CLEX-318):\n\n(a) The State\u2019s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;\n\n(b) The State\u2019s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and\n\n(c) Both cause and effect are grave or substantial.\n\n910.\n\nThe ICSID Tribunal in *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen*  ***(\u2018Desert Line\")***(see ICSID Case No. ARB/5/17, Award, 6 February 2008, CLEX-232) also outlined principles applicable to the awarding of moral damages. That Tribunal pointed out that although It is difficult to substantiate an appropriate sum for moral damages, the Tribunal Indicated that this should not be a deterrent (see\u00a0*Desert Line,* para. 289, CLEX-232)95.\n\nin this respect, the Tribunal takes some heed from *Castillo-Paez v. Peru* (IACHR) (Reparation and Costs), 27, November 1998, CLEX-180, a decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The Court recognised that moral damages are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. As a result, the Court suggested a \"prudent assessment\" of moral damages, with no absolute rule possible. The ICJ also supports this approach, stating: \"in the view of the Court, non-material injury can be established even without specific evidence\" (see\u00a0*Diallo,* p. 334, CLEX-366). The Court awarded US$85,000 for non-material injury.\n\nb) Whether Corporate Claimants may be Awarded Moral Damages\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n911.\n\nThis issue arises in relation to the Border Claimants. The Tribunal in *Desert Line* recognised that moral damages were available to natural and legal persons as a result of harm suffered from breaches of an Investment treaty (see\u00a0*Desert Line,* para. 289, CLEX-232). The Tribunal noted that \"[i]t is also generally recognized that a legal person (as opposed to a natural one) may be awarded moral damages, including loss of reputation, inspecific circumstances only\" (see *ibid.)* *.*\n\n912.\n\nThe Claimant in *Desert Line* sought moral damages on the following basis (see *ibid* *.,* para. 286, CLEX-232):\n\n... [A]s a result of the Respondent's breaches of its obligations under the BIT: the Claimant's executives suffered the stress and anxiety of being harassed, threatened and detained by the Respondent as well as by armed tribes ; the Claimant has suffered a significant injury to its credit and reputation and lost its prestige; the Claimant's executives have been intimidated by the Respondent in relation to the Contracts, [emphasis added],\n\n913.\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately awarded the Claimant US$1,000,000 given that the Claimant\u2019s \"prejudice was substantial since it affected the physical health of the Claimant\u2019s executives and the Claimant\u2019s credit and reputation\" (see\u00a0*Desert Line,* para. 290, CLEX-232). When considering the paragraph from *Desert Line* cited above, it may be noted that the Tribunal does not only describe loss to the company (credit, reputation and prestige). The Tribunal mentions the harm to the company\u2019s executives as central to its finding infavour of moral damages. The Tribunal, therefore, affirmed the principle that a corporation can receive damages based on actions that affected members of its staff.\n\n914.\n\nDr. Sabahi, in his work *Compensation and Restitution in Investor-State Arbitration: Princples and Practice,* touches on this matter when he asks \"can corporations seek compensation for moral damage to the personality rights of their employees?\" (see Sabahi, p. 139, CLEX-306). He follows by noting that the \"Desert Line case seems to answer this question in the affirmative\" (see *ibid.* *,* pp. 139-140). Then, Dr. Sabahi states:\n\nA strict application on the rules of standing should prevent awarding compensation for damage to the executives\u2019 personality rights in the latter scenario [referring to Desert Line], Yet, such an approach could cause practical problems, such as leaving these harms unrepaired, as the most relevant forum for bringing such a suit would be Yemeni courts, which, among other things, may not be able to handle the case with the desired level of independence.\n\nTo remedy this legal shortcoming, then, it is submitted that, by analogy to the doctrine of state espousal, which revolves around the Vattellan fiction that Injury to an Individual is equal to the Injury to the home state of individual, one could think of a doctrine of \u2018corporate espousal\u2019, whereby damage to an employee of a corporation would be considered as damage to the corporation itself. This is the assumption underlying the Desert Line case and would solve the problem of standing.\n\n915.\n\nThe conceptual difficulty of awarding a company moral damages based on the consequences to its employees was also discussed in an article by Dr. Dumberry, who considered that *Desert Line* was \"sensible\" and \"likely to be followed by other tribunals in the future\" (see Patrick Dumberry *\"Compensation for Moral Damages in Investor-State Arbitration Disputes\"* (2010) 27 J Int\u2019l Arb 247, CLEX-302). Nevertheless, Dr. Dumberry points out that the company\u2019s executives, not the company, suffered the harm justifying moral damages. On a strict legal approach, a tribunal would not have jurisdiction to make an award to the physical persons as their claim would not concern an \"investment\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Dr. Dumberry\u2019s analysis is accurate: the harm suffered by the executives is not the harm to the company. Nevertheless, on that approach, the physical staff of the company would only ever be able to get relief through domestic courts, which as Dr. Sabahi notes, may be unable to provide justice. Inlight of these shortcomings, both Drs. Sabahi and Dumberry concluded that the decision in *Desert Line* offers a pragmatic solution to an unappealing situation.\n\n916.\n\nIn view of the above discussion, this Tribunal finds that it is appropriate that staff members of a company have recourse to competent, fair tribunals that can reflect the consequences of their poor treatment in an award of moral damages in favour of their employer. In some sense, this serves not only the function of repairing intangible harm, but also of condemning the actions of the offending State.\n\n917.\n\nAccepting that all claims for moral damages are soundly based, the Tribunal now turns to whether the Claimants are entitled to moral damages and, if so, in what amounts. The Tribunal considers it appropriate to consider Heinrich, the other von Pezold Claimants, and the Border Claimants separately.\n\nc) Heinrich von Pezold\n----------------------\n\n918.\n\nHeinrich\u2019s evidence offers a disturbing account of his treatment, and the treatment of his staff, during the LRP. The Tribunal finds that Heinrich\u2019s summary of his plight is genuine and honest when he says: \"During the invasions, I along with my staff, were humiliated, threatened with death and assaulted, had firearms put to our heads, and were kidnapped\".\n\n919.\n\nThe Respondent made a brief challenge to the evidence provided by Heinrich, suggesting that the Tribunal only had Heinrich\u2019s word to justify moral damages. However, Heinrich\u2019s evidence about events was never seriously challenged. Particularly in respect of Heinrich\u2019s own moral damages claim, it seems difficult to think of evidence more appropriate than his own account of his experiences. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts Heinrich\u2019s detailed and comprehensive account of his treatment and the treatment of his staff.\n\n920.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Heinrich\u2019s treatment warrants moral damages based on the principles outlined by the tribunal in *Lemire*(see para. 909 above). First, the threats of, and actual, physical violence and detainment that Heinrich reported clearly contravene the conduct expected of states. Even if the Respondent did not directly perpetrate these actions, the failure of the police to protect Heinrich von Pezold from the Settlers/War Veterans over so many years falls short of the conduct expected of states. Heinrich was entitled to expect the full protection of the law. He did not receive it. Secondly, the events caused Heinrich considerable stress and anxiety. Heinrich not only worried about his own safety but the safety of his staff. It must be remembered that the events contributing to this stress stretched over a number of years. The Tribunal does not doubt the personal toll this took on Heinrich. Finally, the actions perpetrated against Heinrich and his suffering are grave and substantial. Awarding Heinrich moral damages would reflect the harm he specifically suffered. Simply awarding compensation for unlawful expropriation would not be sufficient.\n\n921.\n\nAs to *quantum,* the Tribunal finds that US$5,000,000 is excessive in light of the decision in *Desert Line.* The Claimant there was exposed to conduct analogous with that evidenced here. As in *Desert Line,* Heinrich is seeking moral damages within the context of recovering substantial sums of damages for unlawful expropriation. Acknowledging that quantification is difficult for non-material harm, the Tribunal considers it should aim for some consistency with other ICSID decisions. Because of the similarities with *Desert Line,* a sum of $1,000,000 would be appropriate. Although Tribunal in *Desert Line* was awarding moral damages for the corporation\u2019s loss of reputation and the harm to a number of executives, the sum of US$1,000,000 remains appropriate especially given the number of years that Heinrich was exposed to these stresses.\n\nd) Other von Pezold Claimants\n-----------------------------\n\n922.\n\nAs to the remaining von Pezold Claimants, they do not reside in Zimbabwe. Their claim for moral damages is based upon their fears for Heinrich and their staff. Undoubtedly these events must have caused them great worry, but the Tribunal is not convinced that this entitles them to moral damages. For example, in another ICSID decision, the Tribunal refused to award moral damages when there was an absence of physical duress (see*Europe Cement Investment & Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2, Award, 13 August 2009, CLEX-246). Additionally, the *Lemire* decision requires that the State\u2019s actions \"imply physical threats, illegal detention or other analogous situations\". The von Pezolds, other than Heinrich, were outside Zimbabwe and so, for that reason, the Tribunal finds that they cannot recover moral damages.\n\ne) Border Claimants\n-------------------\n\n923.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, and following the precedent set in *Desert Line,* the Tribunal is of the view that the Border Claimants are able to claim and recover moral damages. Following *Desert Line,* the Tribunal is of the view that moral damages should be awarded. However, the sum should only be modest. As such, US$1,000,000 - the same sum awarded to Heinrich - is appropriate. In the context of the overall claim, it is not a significant amount but it appropriately reflects the wrongfulness of the actions that occurred in respect of the Border Claimants\u2019 staff.\n\n(6) Conclusion on Compensation in relation to the von Pezold Claimants\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Summary\n-----------\n\n924.\n\nThe full compensation to be awarded to the von Pezold Claimants under the various Heads of Damage is summarised in the following chart:\n\n925.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s task does not end there, however, for the Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief requires the Tribunal to award compensation as between the various von Pezold Claimants in proportion to their entitlement as regards each of the Estates. The Tribunal must also distinguish between the total compensation to be awarded in the event that restitution is performed by the Respondent, and in the event that it is not. It is therefore useful first to summarise the total compensation awarded by the Tribunal in respect of each of the Estates (under both the \"restitution performed\" and \"restitution not performed\" scenarios):\n\nForrester Estate\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Forrester Estate is performed: Forrester Estate Restitution Shortfall (US$15,526,381); Forrester Water Rights (US$425,412); Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall (US$10,085,598); and Forrester Conversion Amount (US$1,409,148). This comes to a total sum of **US$27,446,539.**\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Forrester Estate is not performed: Forrester Estate \"but for\" value (including Forrester Water Permits) (US$39,709,470); Forrester Water Rights (US$425,412); Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall (US$10,085,598); and Forrester Conversion Amount (US$1,409,148). This comes to a total sum of **US$51,629,628.**\n\nMakandi Estate\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Makandi Estate is performed: no Restitution Shortfall has been sought in respect of the Makandi Estate.\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Makandi Estate is not performed: Makandi Estate present value (including Makandi Water Permits) **US$11,144,010.**\n\nBorder Estate\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Border Estate is performed: Border Estate Restitution Shortfall (US$14,205,101); Border Liquidation Shortfall (US$14,957,864); and Border Forex Losses (US$100,533). This comes to a total of **US$29,263,498.**\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Border Estate is not performed: Border Estate \"but for\" value (US$108,982,826); Border Liquidation Shortfall (US$14,957,864); and Border Forex Losses (US$100,533). This comes to a total of **US$124,041,223.**\n\nOther Compensation\n\n(a) Forrester Loans **US$7,186,302.**\n\n(b) Moral damages **US$1,000,000.**\n\n(ii) Apportionment among the von Pezold Claimants\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n926.\n\nIt remains for the Tribunal to determine how the above sums should be apportioned among the von Pezold Claimants.\n\n927.\n\nFor each Estate, the von Pezold Claimants have submitted in what proportion the compensation awarded by the Tribunal should be apportioned among them. The Tribunal sees no reason not to accept the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 submission.\n\nForrester Estate\n----------------\n\n928.\n\nIn respect of the Forrester Estate, the von Pezold Claimants have submitted that the total sum of compensation should be divided equally between the Parent Claimants. Accordingly the Tribunal will order:\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Forrester Estate is performed, the sum of US$27,446,539 will be divided equally between the two Parent Claimants, or in such other manner of allocation that they may prefer; and\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Forrester Estate is not performed, the sum of US$51,629,628 will be divided equally between the two Parent Claimants, or in such other manner of allocation that they may prefer.\n\nMakandi Estate\n--------------\n\n929.\n\nIn respect of the Makandi Estate, the von Pezold Claimants have submitted that the total sum of compensation should be divided equally between the Parent Claimants. Accordingly the Tribunal will order:\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Makandi Estate is performed, there is no additional compensation required in respect of the Makandi Estate; and\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Makandi Estate is not performed, the sum of US$11,144,010 will be divided equally between the two Parent Claimants, or in such other manner of allocation that they may prefer.\n\nBorder Estate\n-------------\n\n930.\n\nIn respect of the Border Estate, the von Pezold Claimants have submitted that the total sum of compensation should be divided 44% to each of the Parent Claimants and the remaining 12% divided equally between the six Adult Children Claimants (that is, Anna Eleonore Elisabeth Webber (n\u00e9e von Pezold), Heinrich Bernd Alexander Josef von Pezold, Maria Juliane Andrea Christiane Katharina Batth\u00e0ny (n\u00e9e von Pezold), Georg Philipp Marcel Johann Lukas von Pezold, Felix Alard Mortiz Hermann Kilian von Pezold and Johann Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Pezold). Accordingly the Tribunal will order:\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Border Estate is performed, the sum of **US$29,263,498** will be divided 44% to each of the Parent Claimants and the remaining 12% divided equally between the six Adult Children Claimants.\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Border Estate is not performed, the sum of **US$124,041,223** will be divided 44% to each of the Parent Claimants and the remaining 12% divided equally between the six Adult Children Claimants.\n\nOther Compensation\n------------------\n\n931.\n\nThe Forrester Loans were made to the Forrester Estate by Elisabeth. Therefore the sum of **US$7,186,302** will be awarded directly to Elisabeth.\n\n932.\n\nMoral damages have been awarded specifically in respect of the Respondent\u2019s treatment of Heinrich. Therefore the sum of **US$1,000,000** will be awarded directly to Heinrich.\n\n(7) Conclusion on Compensation in relation to the Border Claimants\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n933.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal has found that the Border Claimants are entitled to recover under three Heads of Damage in respect of the Border Estate. The exact figure of compensation to be awarded, however, will depend on whether or not restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties comprising the Border Estate is provided by the Respondent:\n\n(a) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Border Estate is performed: Border Estate Restitution Shortfall (US$14,205,101); Border Liquidation Shortfall (US$14,957,864); and Border Forex Losses (US$100,533). This comes to a total of **US$29,263,498.**\n\n(b) If restitution of the Zimbabwean Properties of the Border Estate is not performed: Border Estate \"but for\" value (US$108,982,826); Border Liquidation Shortfall (US$14,957,864); and Border Forex Losses (US$100,533). This comes to a total of **US$124,041,223.**\n\n934.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Border Claimants are also entitled to moral damages in the amount of **US$1,000,000.** The Border Claimants have requested that moral damages be paid to Border in that amount. The Tribunal sees no reason not to accept the Border Claimants\u2019 request and will accordingly so order.\n\n935.\n\nIn terms of apportionment of the remaining compensation between the respective Border Claimants, the Border Claimants have requested that the Tribunal allocate damages to Border, or in other such manner of allocation as the Border Claimants may prefer. The Tribunal will accordingly so order.\n\n(8) Material impossibility and double recovery\n----------------------------------------------\n\n936.\n\nOne final word needs to be said about the Tribunal\u2019s *quantum* findings. As noted at the outset of this Award, the present proceeding in fact comprises one part of a pair of arbitrations, heard together but with separate outcomes (see para. 5 above). There is significant overlap between these Awards, however, because both the von Pezold Claimants in this proceeding and the Border Claimants in the other proceeding have made claims in respect of the same loss as concerns the Border Estate. Both the von Pezold Claimants and Border Claimants have sought - and shall be awarded - the same rights to restitution and compensation, or compensation in the alternative, in respect of the losses relating to the Border Estate.\n\n937.\n\nThis situation might be considered somewhat unorthodox. Nevertheless, the Tribunal does not consider that the existence of two separate but related arbitrations can act as a bar to recovery. For the Tribunal to refuse to grant relief in either arbitration simply because two sets of Claimants share overlapping rights under international law would render an injustice to both sets of Claimants. This fact has been recognised by past tribunals. In *Lauder v. Czech Republic,* para. 174, CLEX-190, it was said in respect of multiple claims brought by both company and shareholder that:\n\nFinally, there is no abuse of process in the multiplicity of proceedings initiated by Mr Lauder and the entities he controls. Even assuming the doctrine of abuse of process could find application here, the Arbitral Tribunal is the only forum with jurisdiction to hear Mr Lauder\u2019s claims based on the Treaty. The existence of numerous parallel proceedings does in no way affect the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s authority and effectiveness, and does not undermine the Parties\u2019 rights. On the contrary, the present proceedings are the only place where the Parties\u2019 rights under the Treaty can be protected.\n\n938.\n\nAlthough, formally, each tribunal has been constituted separately, and has adjudicated the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 and Border Claimants\u2019 respective claims separately, it would be artificial to pretend that this Tribunal is unaware of its counterpart Award, or the consequences of it. The Tribunal therefore wishes to make clear that, although the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants have each been granted the same relief in respect of the Border Estate, these rights cannot both be jointly enforceable. To the extent that one set of Claimants (von Pezold or Border) enforces its right to restitution of the expropriated Border Properties, restitution will, become legally and materially impossible for the other set of Claimants. Similarly, to the extent that the Border Claimants enforce their right to compensation in respect of the Border Properties (or, for that matter, the Border Liquidation Shortfall and Border Forex Losses), the right to compensation of that amount in the name of the von Pezold Claimants will become unenforceable as an impermissible double recovery (given that, ultimately, it is the von Pezold Claimants who control the Border Claimants: see paras. 320-326 above) (see also*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi AS v Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, paras. 270-272)98. Such an outcome would, undoubtedly, be the case if the two sets of Claimants had brought proceedings consecutively rather than concurrently.\n\nThis excludes moral damages in the name of the von Pezold Claimants, which are, of course, recoverable only by the von Pezold Claimants.\n\n(9) Interest\n------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n939.\n\nThe Claimants note that Article 4(2) of the German BIT and Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT expressly provide for the payment of commercial rates of interest on compensation for lawful expropriation. inregard to all other breaches, the Claimants submit that it is a principle of customary international law that interest must be paid on the damages awarded in order to ensure full reparation (see Cl. Skel., para. 200, citing ILC Article 38; *Vivendf, Continental Casualty).* The Claimants submit that compound interest should be awarded, and they claim interest at the rate of 21.5%, or alternatively at the rate of 9.2%, both compounded every six months. These figures represent, respectively, the rates of return the von Pezold Claimants have earned on their African investments and their London investment fund. The Claimants aver that the rate of LIBOR plus 2%, as proposed by the Respondent, has no relationship to the Claimants\u2019 lost returns on compensation and therefore must be rejected.\n\n940.\n\nThe Claimants submit that interest is due from the date of breach until the date of payment, save on a current date valuation, and for moral damages, interest is due from the date of the award until the date of payment. The Claimants note that, as all profits from the Estates have been reinvested back into the Estates, there is no concern of double compensation in awarding interest from an earlier date (see Cl. Skel., para. 201).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n941.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimants have any right to compound interest, especially because they have continued to enjoy \"annual benefits\" on their investments in the Zimbabwean Companies. The Respondent submits that any interest which may be granted by the Tribunal should not exceed LIBOR plus 2% (see Rejoinder, para. 20.1.8).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n942.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Pre-Award interest should be awarded in the present case only in respect of the Heads of Damage not pertaining directly to the Zimbabwean or Residual Properties as outlined at para. 896 above. Pre-Award interest will not apply either to the moral damages awarded by the Tribunal. Post-Award interest, however, will apply in respect of all damages awarded.\n\n943.\n\nIt is well known that Pre- and Post-Award interest serve separate functions. Pre-Award interest is granted in order to ensure full reparation (see\u00a0*Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 235, CLEX-274). It acts as a proxy to compensate the successful party for being kept out of his or her money from the time of breach up until the date of the Award (see\u00a0*Siemens,* Award, 6 February 2007, para. 396, CLEX-223; see also\u00a0*Compania Del Desarrollo De Santa Elena, S.A. v Republic of Costa Rica*  ***(\"Santa Elena\"),*** ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award, 17 February 2000, para. 104, CLEX-183). Pre-Award interest thus serves as \"a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances\" (see\u00a0*Santa Elena,* para. 104, CLEX-183). Post-Award interest serves a different purpose, namely \"to serve as an effective incentive to comply with the terms of the judgment or award as expediently as possible\" (see\u00a0*Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* para. 6,246).\n\nPre-Award Interest\n------------------\n\n944.\n\nUnderstood in this light, it is not necessary or appropriate to apply Pre-Award interest to the compensatory sums awarded to the Claimants in respect of the expropriated Zimbabwean and Residual Properties (those sums being either (a) the Residual Shortfalls in the event that restitution is provided by the Respondent;99 or (b) the full value of the properties calculated above in the event that restitution is not provided by the Respondent100). The Claimants, having remained in occupation of the Estates, have retained the benefit of creating value from their investments, which value they have subsequently reinvested. Thus, the \"lost opportunity\" of investing their money, for which Pre-Award interest is intended to compensate, has not truly occurred. The benefit of the Claimants\u2019 investments will be enjoyed by whoever retains the properties. If legal title to the Zimbabwean Properties is restored to the Claimants by way of restitution, the Claimants will take the benefit of their past investment. If the Respondent does not provide restitution, then the Claimants will receive the value of those properties as at the time of the Award through compensation, with the value of their prior investment accounted for in the value of the properties. This was the position taken by the Tribunal in *ADC v. Hungary,* which noted that \"[s]ince the calculation is based on the value of the expropriated investments as of the date of the award, no pre-award interest has accrued\" (see *ibid.* *,* *ADC Affiliate Ltd v. Hungary,* para. 520, CLEX-220). The Tribunal finds the same approach should apply here.\n\nSee above paras. 832, 840 and 872.\n\nSee above paras. 824, 840 and 869.\n\n945.\n\nHowever, the Claimants have also sought Pre-Award interest for the compensation awarded to them under those Heads of Damage not pertaining directly to the Zimbabwean or Residual Properties (see Corrected Request for Relief, Annex 1 and paras. 881-896 above). Those Heads of Damage comprise:\n\na) The Forrester Loans - US$7,186,302;\n\nb) The Forrester Water Rights - US$425,412;\n\nc) The Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall - US$10,085,598;\n\nd) The Forrester Conversion Amount - US$1,409,148;\n\ne) The Border Liquidation Shortfall - US$14,957,864; and\n\nf) The Border Forex Losses - US$100,533.\n\n946.\n\nPre-Award interest is appropriate in respect of these other Heads of Damage to achieve full reparation for the Claimants, reflecting the Claimants\u2019 lost opportunity to enjoy access to this money between the time of breach and the date of this Award. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Pre-Award interest should be awarded from the relevant date of breach in respect of each of the above-listed Heads of Damage. It will be noted that this list excludes the Tribunal\u2019s award of moral damages - the Tribunal considers that the \"lost opportunity\" function of Pre-Award interest is similarly inapposite in respect of moral damages.\n\n947.\n\nThe Claimants have proposed a number of interest rates for Pre-Award interest, the higher two (21.5% and 9.8%) based on returns from two of their investments: the von Pezold\u2019s African investments and their London investment fund, respectively (see Cl. Skeleton, para. 200). It is relevant to take into account the returns the Claimants might have earned on these investments because, had they been immediately compensated for the wrongs they suffered, this is where the Claimants contend they would have invested their wealth (see ILC Articles, Article 38. For a fuller discussion on interest, see *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* paras. 304-316, CLEX-236). Even taking these circumstances into account, however, the Tribunal does not find 21.5% or even 9.8% to be an appropriate rate of interest. Those rates would be anomalously high compared with the rates of interest granted by other ICSID Tribunal Awards (see, e.g., *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* para. 314, CLEX-236; and *loannis Kardassopulos and* *Ron Fuchs v. Republic of Georgia,* para. 661, CLEX-248; *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador,* para. 841, CLEX-414). For this reason, the Tribunal finds the six-month USD LIBOR rate plus 2% to be appropriate.\n\n948.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore order Pre-Award interest at the six-month USD LIBOR rate plus 2% in respect of the Heads of Damage listed above at para. 896, as calculated from the dates listed below unil the date of this Award.\n\n949.\n\nPre-Award interest should generally run from the date on which the breach occurred. Those dates are, respectively (see paras. 511-521 and 552-561 above):\n\n(a) The Forrester Loans - 31 December 2011;\n\n(b) The Forrester Water Rights - 1 January 2000;\n\n(c) The Forrester Tobacco Value Shortfall - 1 January 2004;\n\n(d) The Forrester Conversion Amount - 31 December 2008;\n\n(e) The Border Liquidation Shortfall - 1 January 2004; and\n\n(f) The Border Forex Losses - 5 September 2008.\n\nPost-Award Interest\n-------------------\n\n950.\n\nUnfortunately, there is little guidance on the appropriate Post-Award rate of interest (see e.g., *Articles on State Responsibility,* p. 269), which is largely left to the discretion of the Tribunal. In the present case, and with a view to incentivizing Zimbabwe to comply with the Award, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to fix a rate of Post-Award interest at the six-month USD LIBOR rate plus 2% and it is so ordered.\n\n951.\n\nAs the Tribunal has decided to grant to the Respondent a delay of 90 days from the date of the dispatch of the Tribunal's Award to pay the Restitution Shortfalls if restitution in full is effected within that timeline and, alternatively, to pay compensation in the event restitution in full is not effected within a delay of 120 days from that date, and with the view of incentivizing Zimbabwe to comply with the Award, the Tribunal will order that Pre-Award compound interest only become due and Post-Award compound interest only start to run on any outstanding amount 90 or 120 days from the date of dispatch of the Award, as the case may be. In respect of damages to be paid forthwith (the Forrester Loans and moral damages), pre-Award interest will be due immediately (for the Forrester Loans) and post-Award interest will run from the date of this Award.\n\nCompounding of Interest\n-----------------------\n\n952.\n\nFinally, while public international law traditionally awards simple interest, investment treaty arbitration has developed a practice of awarding compound interest if the circumstances so warrant. The decision of the tribunal in *Santa Elena* distinguished cases relating to the valuation of property or property rights from simple breaches of contract, finding that the former cases warranted compound interest in order to award the full present value of the compensation that the investor should have received at the time of the taking (see*Santa Elena,* CLEX-183). The tribunals in *CMS*(see Award. 12 May 2005, CLEX-316) and *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*(see ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, CLEX-219) also granted compound interest.\n\n953.\n\nAs this is a clear expropriation case, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants should be awarded compound interest. In order to reflect business and economic reality, the Tribunal finds that it is appropriate for both Pre- and Post-Award interest to be compounded at six-month intervals.\n\n(10) Declaratory Relief\n-----------------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n954.\n\nIn addition to restitution and/or damages, the Claimants also seek declaratory relief. The declarations sought by the Claimants are set out at Section II (i) to (viii) and Section III (i) to (viii) of the Claimants\u2019 Corrected Request for Relief, dated 10 May 2013.\n\n955.\n\nThe Claimants, in their Memorial, submitted that \"Declarations in respect of wrongful conduct as a form of relief are common practice in institutional arbitral tribunals including those constituted pursuant to the ICSID Convention101.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1582. Claimants refer to *Europe Cement Investment and Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/07/02, Award, 13 August 2009, para. 148 (CLEX-246).\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n956.\n\nAs stated above, the Respondent opposes all of the relief sought by the Claimants, including the declarations set out in the Claimants\u2019 Corrected Request for Relief,102 although it does not dispute the Tribunal\u2019s powerto order declaratory relief. The Respondent has also sought what it has framed as declaratory relief: see Respondent\u2019s Corrected Request for Relief.\n\nSee the Respondent\u2019s Corrected Request for Relief of 9 September 2013, which is reproduced above at para. 90 of the present Award.\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n957.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. As Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention requires the tribunal to \"deal with every question submitted to\" it, the Tribunal has the power to issue declaratory relief and so finds. The award of declaratory relief in relation to the declarations sought by the Claimants in the Claimants\u2019 Corrected Request for Relief turns on the Tribunal\u2019s determinations with respect to the merits. In respect of the Respondent\u2019s requests for declaratory relief, which, in effect, amount to no more than a refutation of the Claimants\u2019 claims, it is appropriate that these be denied in their entirety.\n\n**VII Costs**\n-------------\n\n(i) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n958.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 primary submission is that \"if they broadly succeed overall then costs should follow the event, i.e. the Respondent is ordered to pay all of the Claimants\u2019 legal costs, all of the arbitration costs (whether advanced by the Claimants or the Respondent to date) and bear its own legal costs\" (see Cl. Submission on Costs, para. 2).\n\n959.\n\nThe Claimants aver that \"[t]his is the usual course in international arbitration, and there is no reason under this scenario to depart from it in these proceedings, especially given the Respondent\u2019s conduct\" (see *ibid* *.).*\n\n960.\n\nReferring to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2) and the decisions of some ICSID tribunals, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should assess the legal costs and apportion the legal and arbitration costs between the parties \"in a manner it deems appropriate\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 4).\n\n961.\n\nWith respect to the legal costs incurred, the Claimants write that they \"must have been necessary for the purpose of the arbitration (i.e. reasonably incurred or borne) and be reasonable in amount\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 6)\n\n962.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention confers ICSID tribunals with \"broad discretion\" as to how they award and apportion costs.\n\n963.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal should take account of the costs implications of procedural motions raised by one or the other party in order to ensure the need for full reparation (see *ibid* *..* paras. 7-9, 11).\n\n964.\n\nThe Claimants spend more than nine pages detailing what they refer to as \"the Respondent\u2019s poor conduct before and during the arbitration\" which, they plead, in addition to the need to ensure full reparation, is a reason for an order for costs to follow the event (see *ibid* *.,* para. 12). The instances of the Respondent\u2019s \"poor conduct\" include, according to the Claimants, the following:\n\n(a) The egregious nature of the Respondent\u2019s breaches;\n\n(b) The failure of the Respondent to produce land audit documents;\n\n(c) The poor presentation of the Respondent\u2019s pleadings which were \"convoluted, incoherent, repetitive and prolix\";\n\n(d) The vast amount of irrelevant material set out in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings;\n\n(e) The Respondent\u2019s attacks on the character of the Claimants without supporting evidence;\n\n(f) The late filing by the Respondent of objections to jurisdiction, admissibility and defences;\n\n(g) The Inclusion by the Respondent of inadmissible material in the Hearing transcripts and Post-Hearing Briefs; and\n\n(h) The choice and conduct of the Respondent\u2019s valuation witnesses, Messrs.

and\n\n(e) The time spent and the complexity of the cases, including having to respond to ten objections to jurisdiction and two objections to admissibility and the fact that there were four rounds of pleadings and multiple procedural applications.\n\n967.\n\nRecalling that these two arbitrations were prepared and argued as if they were a single case and that, in their view, \"the von Pezold Claimants have benefitted more from the legal work undertaken by the Claimants\u2019 lawyers and experts than have the Border Claimants,\" the Claimants propose that any award of costs to the Claimants be split \"92% to the von Pezold Claimants and 8% to the Border Claimants\".\n\n968.\n\nFinally, the Claimants request that interest be ordered on costs from the date of the awards until the date of payment (see *ibid* *.,* para. 68).\n\n969.\n\nInreply to the Respondent\u2019s costs submissions, the Claimants submit that the Respondent \"in a number of instances goes beyond merely making submission on costs\" and that \"it seeks (once again) to reiterate and re-plead its case (in many instances beyond the parameters as established by the Procedural Orders)\" (see Cl. Reply Costs Submission, para. 4).\n\n970.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s submissions, say the Claimants, \"are based on misrepresentations of the facts, assumptions that have been proven to be untrue, and assertions that conflict with the Procedural Orders\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 3).\n\n971.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s extensive allegations concerning the Claimants\u2019 \"poor conduct\", the Claimants assert \"that their conduct was reasonable at all relevant times [and that] there is no basis for a costs sanction in regard to their conduct\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 10). The Claimants deny, in some detail, the Respondent\u2019s many allegations asserting, in turn, that they were \"untrue\" (para. 12) \"unsubstantiated\" (paras. 13-15), \"wholly incorrect\" (paras. 18; 29), \"unjustified\" (paras. 22-46), \"completely false and unjustifiable\" (para. 26) and \"unfounded\" (para. 43).\n\n972.\n\nInconcluding their Comments and in reply to some of the Respondent\u2019s critique, the Claimants assert (see *ibid* *.,* para. 63):\n\n[...] the manner in which the Respondent\u2019s counsel have conducted this case has caused an enormous amount of disruption to these proceedings, done very little to define the issues, and required the Claimants\u2019 counsel to undertake a significant amount of work at very unsociable hours. Disruptive conduct is relevant to an award of costs. The Claimants\u2019 counsel have responded to the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the best way they can; they have not sought to obtain a procedural advantage, but have simply Insisted that the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Procedural Orders are followed.\n\n973.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s legal costs, the Claimants say (see *ibid* *.,* para. 64):\n\nThe amounts claimed are not large in the context of a very significant International arbitration. However, it is not possible to determine If they are reasonable as there is no indication of the hourly rates charged or hours Incurred. Furthermore, it is noted that the Respondent\u2019s valuation expert (Mr Kanyekanye) did not charge any fees, nor did the members of the Respondent\u2019s civil service who were witnesses, counsel and experts for the Respondent. Therefore a comparison with the Claimants\u2019 costs is not possible.\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n974.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s primary submission is that, irrespective of the outcome of these arbitrations, the Claimants should bear all of their own legal costs, pay the Respondent\u2019s legal costs and pay all of the arbitration costs (see Resp. Costs Submission, paras. 4, 28, 29, 43 and 64).\n\n975.\n\nInsupport of this primary submission, the Respondent pleads the \"insidious conduct\" of the Claimants \"from the inception of their covert acquisitions in the Host State through their conduct in these arbitrations\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 2).\n\n976.\n\nThe allegations of the Respondent concerning \"the procedural conduct\" of the Claimants which, it says, justifies that they should bear all the costs of the present proceedings include (see *ibid* *.,* pp. 1-6):\n\n1.1.1 Claimants are responsible for needlessly Initiating two Arbitrations (subsequently merged), enlarging costs, risks and difficulty and unfairly burdening Respondent.\n\n1.1.2 Claimants\u2019 teeming November 2012 damages submissions were received by Respondent only three weeks before submission of the Rejoinder, unfairly complicating Respondent\u2019s work at a critical time.\n\n1.1.3 Claimants\u2019 \"Muzite Party\" Urgent Application for Provisional Measures was received two and a half business days after Respondent\u2019s receipt of the Surrejoinder, consuming time allotted for its analysis and for preparation of the Rebutter, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\n1.1.4 Claimants\u2019 \"Don't Kill Heinrich\" Urgent Application for Provisional Measures was received one week after Respondent\u2019s receipt of the Surrejoinder, consuming time allotted for its analysis and for preparation of the Rebutter, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\n1.1.5 Claimants\u2019 voluminous May 2013 updated damages submissions were unsolicited and received by Respondent only three weeks before the scheduled June 2014 Oral Hearings in Singapore, unfairly complicating Respondent\u2019s work at a critical time.\n\n1.1.6 Claimants\u2019 Urgent Application re Thornton Farm that demanded respect of the status quo that Claimants have not themselves respected spanned two months, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\n1.1.7 Claimants Insidious weakening of Respondent\u2019s Small Arbitration Team by reducing physical rest and capacity.\n\n1.1.7.1 Claimants Insisted on and obtained unusual \"London\" time deadline for exchanging Respondent\u2019s Hearing Exhibits.\n\n1.1.7.2 Claimants\u2019 Insisted that documents used during oral proceedings be limited to and use TB reference numbers yet the cross-examination witness packs Claimants distributed during Oral Examination of Respondent\u2019s witnesses bore no Trial Bundle references, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\nIn contrast to Claimants\u2019 damages experts who had the luxury of open access and unlimited time, Respondent\u2019s damages experts had limited access to and time on the Properties and equipment, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\n977.\n\nThe allegations of the Respondent concerning the Claimants\u2019 choice of insidious tactics throughout these arbitrations which, it submits, justifies that they should bear all the costs of these arbitrations include (see *ibid* *.,* pp. 6-8):\n\n1.2.1 Claimants are responsible, from the onset, for obstructing and delaying Respondent\u2019s audit of the claim and parties holding assets by means of unduly long, obscure and nebulous submissions, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\n1.2.2 Claimants are responsible for obstructing Respondent\u2019s understanding of entity-specific foreign ownership of their confidential acquisitions, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent.\n\n1.2.2.1 Claimants concealed specifics of Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Forrester\n\n1.2.2.2 Claimants concealed specifics of Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Border\n\n1.2.3 Claimants concealed specifics of Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Makandi.\n\n978.\n\nThe Respondent also avers that the Claimants\u2019 \"ill-founded procedural attempts to conceal lack of approval\" added significant costs to the proceedings. In this connection, the Respondent refers to (see *ibid* *.,* pp. 8-11):\n\n1.3.1 Claimants\u2019 Urgent Application to remove Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, unduly complicated and delayed proceedings.\n\n1.3.2 Claimants\u2019 Application at the end of the 21 May 2013 telephone conference to remove Respondent\u2019s Rebutter, also unduly delayed Claimants\u2019 disclosure in these proceedings and complicated Respondent\u2019s work and defence.\n\n1.3.3 Claimants are responsible for avoiding and deferring their ultimately simple response to Respondent\u2019s question as to what BIT-access-condltlon-approvals any specific foreign Claimant entity might have, unfairly hindering and burdening Respondent\u2019s work and defence.\n\n979.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s \"decision to bring these arbitrations without meeting Article 9b) German BIT specific approval requirement and Article 2 Swiss BIT/Article 9a German BIT is reason for Claimants to bear costs\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 1.4).\n\n980.\n\nAlso, in support of its central argument that the Claimants should be responsible for all the costs of these proceeding, the Respondent invokes Zimbabwe\u2019s \"limited resources\" as well as its counsel\u2019s \"lack of competence or fatigue after sleepless nights\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 1.4).\n\n981.\n\nThe Respondent then refers to ICSID precedents which, it avers, are precedents \"for having Claimants bear all of their costs and expenses in these arbitrations\" as \"costs beyond their own costs and expenses\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 84).\n\n982.\n\nPrior to detailing their costs, the Respondent acknowledges that its request for relief in regard to costs today is different to that it requested in its pleadings because of \"the evolution of Its understanding today of facts previously dissimulated or concealed\" (see *ibid* *.,* pp. 19 and 20).\n\n983.\n\nIn closing, the Respondent presents a summary of the costs it has Incurred in connection with these arbitrations as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table of Costs and Expenses incurred by Government of Zimbabwe -

Reply Costs Submission, para. 1.1).\n\n985.\n\nThe Respondent, essentially, submits that the Claimants\u2019 conduct constitutes \"over litigation\", including \"excessive and needless procedural motions\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 22) and reiterates that they should bear the entire costs of these arbitrations\" (see *ibid* *.,* para. 41).\n\n(iii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------\n\n986.\n\nThe Trlbunal notes that the Claimants and the Respondent have each requested that the opposing party be ordered to pay the full costs of the arbitration.\n\n987.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that neither the German BIT nor the Swiss BIT contain provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration in the case of a dispute between an investor and a Contracting Party.\n\n988.\n\nHowever, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do provide the Tribunal with some limited guidance with respect to the allocation of costs in an ICSID arbitration.\n\n989.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses Incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n990.\n\nArbitration Rule 28(2) provides:\n\nPromptly after the closure of the proceedings, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably Incurred or borne by It in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs Incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional Information concerning the cost of the proceeding.\n\n991.\n\nArbitration Rule 47 provides:\n\nThe award shall be in writing and shall contain:\n\n[...]\n\n(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\n\n992.\n\nThe Parties deposited with ICSID a total of US$1,389,625 to cover the costs of these two arbitrations: US$695,000 by the Claimants and US$694,625 by the Respondent. In addition, the Claimants had paid twice a US$25,000 lodging fee when filing their Requests for Arbitration.\n\n993.\n\nThe fees of Mr. David A.R. Williams, the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, amount to US$213,726.75. Mr. Williams\u2019 expenses amount to US$23,653.25.\n\n994.\n\nThe fees of Prof. Mutharika, the arbitrator initially appointed by the Respondent amount to US$15,000. Prof. Mutharika\u2019s expenses amount to US$11,009.22. The fees of Prof. Chen, the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent after the resignation of Prof. Mutharika, amount to US$92,060. Prof. Chen\u2019s expenses amount to US$NIL. The fees of Mr. Michael Hwang, the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent following the resignation of Prof. Chen, amount to US$113,309.29. Mr. Hwang\u2019s expenses amount to US$17,542.88.\n\n995.\n\nThe fees of The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, the President, amount to US$244,575 and his expenses amount to US$11,903.91.\n\n996.\n\nThe fees of Ms. Alison FitzGerald, the Tribunals\u2019 Assistant, amount to US$160,550 and her expenses amount to US$8,353.09. The fees of Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, the Tribunal\u2019s Assistant before Ms. FitzGerald, amount to US$3,250.\n\n997.\n\nThe administrative fees of ICSID amount to US$284,000.\n\n998.\n\nOther costs, including court reporters, hearing rooms, meetings facilities and all other ICSID expenses relating to these two arbitration proceedings amount to US$112,519.31103.\n\nThis amount consists of the arbitration costs at the time of the Award, and estimated charges of app. US$993.13 for the costs to be incurred in connection with the dispatch of the Award (e.g., costs related to courier services, binding, and photocopying). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement as soon all invoices are received and the account is final. The balance remaining in the case account will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n999.\n\nAccordingly, the costs of the arbitrations, including all items set out above in paras. 993--998, amount to US$1,311,452.70.\n\n1000.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide minimal guidance to tribunals with respect to the allocation of the costs of an arbitration and the legal costs of the parties. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention is quoted again for reference:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses Incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n1001.\n\nWhile the guidance may be minimal, it is crystal clear from the wording of the Article that it confers on ICSID tribunals broad and unfettered discretion in assessing and allocating the costs of an arbitration proceeding. This has been recognized by numerous ICSID tribunals104.\n\nSee, e.g. *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award 31 March 2011, para 362; *Libananco Holdings Co Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, para 560; *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, August 27, 2008, para 316.\n\n1002.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that in a number of ICSID precedents, the tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, has ruled that the starting point in an award of costs is that it should reflect the relative success of parties in the proceeding and that, if a party has clearly prevailed, there is no reason in principle why that party should not be paid his costs by the unsuccessful party105.\n\nSee e.g., *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB03/26, Award, August 2, 2006, para 338; *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, April 15, 2009, para. 152; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, October 2, 2006, para. 542; *loannis Kardassopulos v. Republic of Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Award, March 3, 2010, para. 692.\n\n1003.\n\nIn the present proceedings, it is clear to the Tribunal that the Claimants have prevailed and have been successful in respect of both jurisdiction and merits. The Tribunal can see no reason why the Respondent, the unsuccessful party, should not bear the costs of the arbitrations, i.e., US$1,311,452.70 and it is so ordered.\n\n1004.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent will bear its own costs and will reimburse to the Claimants the lodging fees and pay the Claimants\u2019 share of the arbitration costs, i.e., one half of the total arbitration costs, amounting to US$655,726.35.\n\n1005.\n\nAs regards the costs of legal representation and other costs, as mentioned above, the Tribunal has the unfettered discretion to fix and decide in what proportions these costs shall be borne by the parties.\n\n1006.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has formed the view that, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, the Respondent should bear its own costs of legal representation and assistance and the Claimants should be awarded their full costs of legal representation and assistance.\n\n1007.\n\nAmong the circumstances that the Tribunal finds relevant are the egregious nature of the Respondent\u2019s breaches and the fact that the Claimants have been successful in having the Respondent\u2019s many objections to jurisdiction and admissibility dismissed and have prevailed on the merits of many important claims.\n\n1008.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds as relevant to its decision the fact that some of the Respondent\u2019s conduct in these arbitrations resulted in an unnecessary escalation of the costs of the proceedings. In this connection, the Tribunal notes, in particular, the convoluted and repetitive presentation of the Respondent\u2019s pleadings, the inclusion of irrelevant material set out in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings, the late elaboration by the Respondent of certain objections to jurisdiction, admissibility and defences as well as the inclusion by the Respondent of inadmissible material in the Hearing transcripts and Post-Hearing Briefs106.\n\nSee\u00a0*Zhinvali Development Ltd, v. Republic of Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1), Award, 24 January 2003, para. 420 *et seq.* *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,* Award, 16 September 2003, paras. 24.4-24.8.\n\n1009.\n\nHaving scrutinized the costs for legal representation and assistance of the Claimants, the Tribunal finds that they were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount.\n\n1010.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent will reimburse to the Claimants the following costs, \u00a37,771,072.63, US$1,792,229.39 (consisting of (a) US$705,726.35, which comprises the Claimants\u2019 share of the arbitration costs (US$655,726.35) and lodging fees paid (US$50,000) and (b) US$1,086,503.04 in legal fees) and ZAR662,393.62 to be apportioned as the Claimants have proposed107, as follows: 92% to the von Pezold Claimants in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, i.e., \u00a37,149,386.82, US$1,648,851.04 and ZAR609,402.13, and 8% to the Border Claimants in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25, i.e., \u00a3621,685.81, US$143,378.35 and ZAR52,991.49, and it is so ordered.\n\nSee above para. 967.\n\n1011.\n\nThese sums will bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2% from the date of the Award until the date of payment.\n\n**VIII Operative Part**\n-----------------------\n\n**For all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all claims and submissions to the contrary, the Tribunal HEREBY FINDS, DECLARES AND AWARDS as follows:**\n\n**(i) Declaratory Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n1012.\n\nThe Tribunal finds and declares, in relation to the von Pezold Claimants:\n\n**Jurisdiction**\n----------------\n\n1013.\n\nThe BIT entered into between the Federal Republic of Germany and Zimbabwe on 29 September 1995 provisionally applied from 18 September 1996.\n\n1014.\n\nThe Respondent is estopped from (a) denying that the von Pezold Claimants\u2019 investments were specifically approved by the Respondent\u2019s competent authorities at the time of their admission;

Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the **\"von Pezold Award\"** and the **\"Border Timbers Award,\"** respectively, and together the **\"Awards\")** pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committees (the **\"Committees\")** in these matters were constituted on 21 December 2015. The Committees conducted a joint first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceedings.\n\n3.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting the order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the **\"Application\").** Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties\u2019 filing of further observations on the matter.\n\n4.\n\nBy a letter dated 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committees, informing the Parties of the Committees\u2019 decision to deny the Applicant\u2019s request for an interim order and inviting Bernhard von Pezold and others and Border Timbers Limited and others (the **\"Respondents\"** or **\"VPB\")** to submit their response to the Application by 2 March 2016.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, the Respondents filed their response to the Applicant\u2019s Application (the **\"Response\").**\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 4 March 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties advising them that the Committees would rule on the Application on the basis of the record before them.\n\n**II.** **Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicant\u2019s Application**\n----------------------------------\n\n**1.The Factual Basis of the Application**\n------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Application arises from the publication of the von Pezold Award on the website of *ITA Law,* an investment arbitration information service, and the subsequent media coverage, including a series of articles on the von Pezold Award published by the *Investment Arbitration Reporter* **(\"IA Reporter\")** on 11 February 2016.1 The Applicant contends that it was the Respondents who were responsible for \"leaking\" the von Pezold Award to the media.2 The Applicant also claims that the Respondents had previously made the von Pezold Award publicly known by attaching it, on 20 August 2015, to an affidavit filed by Mr Peter Lewis Bailey, the judicial manager of Border Timbers Limited, in public High Court of Zimbabwe proceedings (the **\"Bailey Affidavit\").3**\n\nApplication, pp. 2-3, paras. 4, 9-12.\n\nApplication, pp. 4 *et seq.,* paras. 13 *et seq.*\n\nApplication, pp. 4-5, paras. 15-17; p. 7, para. 27.\n\n8.\n\nThe Applicant contends that counsel for the Respondents \"continued to heat the fire\" by further commenting on the von Pezold Award in an article published by the *Global Arbitration Review* on 16 February 2016. The Applicant notes that the article was inaccurate insofar as it reported that the arbitral tribunals in the original proceedings had held a five-day hearing, while in fact there were six days of hearings.\n\n9.\n\nThe Applicant argues that, contrary to what is suggested by the Respondents, the publication of the von Pezold Award on *ITA Law* cannot be attributable to the Applicant as only those Zimbabwe representatives who are on the ICSID mailing list and the Minister of Lands had access to the Awards; all other government officials were only provided with a summary.4 The Applicant also suggests that it cannot be a coincidence that *ITA Law* published precisely the same material that had been exhibited by the Respondents in the Zimbabwean High Court proceedings.5 According to the Applicant, the Respondents \"could have simply certified to the High Court of Zimbabwe in VPB\u2019s court papers that they had won in the ICSID award, summarizing or quoting a particular relevant passage, ... instead of having their manager disclose the whole award.\"6\n\nApplication, p. 4, paras. 13-14.\n\nApplication, p. 8, para. 30.\n\nApplication, p. 5, para. 17.\n\n10.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that \"non-disclosure was the agreed rule and practice\" in the original proceedings, and that such practice \"also constitute[d] an agreement that should not be lifted without both parties\u2019 consent.\"7 According to the Applicant, this was reflected in the Parties\u2019 agreement not to consent to the publication of the arbitral awards, as recorded in procedural order No. 1 issued by the arbitral tribunal in the original proceedings.8\n\nApplication, pp. 5-6, paras. 19-23.\n\nApplication, pp. 5-6, paras. 19-23.\n\n11.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Respondents, by commenting on the Awards in the public domain, have exacerbated the dispute. The Respondents have also thereby diverted the Applicant\u2019s attention from its pleadings on the stay, and converted the legal debate into a political public debate.9 Indeed, a disruption of the Applicant\u2019s work on its pleadings appears to be the \"strategic goal\" of the Respondents.10 Even assuming the Respondents had not \"leaked\" the von Pezold Award, the Applicant submits that they have \"legitimized\" it by way of their legal counsel taking the initiative of commenting on the von Pezold Award in the media and subsequently issuing a press release, while the annulment proceedings are still underway.11 According to the Applicant, the Respondents\u2019 conduct is likely to continue if not stopped by the Committees.12\n\nApplication, p. 7, para. 25.\n\nApplication, p. 9, para. 39.\n\nApplication, pp. 7-8, paras. 26 and 34.\n\nApplication, p. 9, para. 38.\n\n**2.The Legal Basis of the Application**\n----------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn support of its Application, the Applicant relies on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.13 Quoting the decision on provisional measures in *Occidental Petroleum et al* v. *Ecuador,* the Applicant argues that, \"in order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm.\"14\n\nApplication, p. 2, para. 2.\n\nApplication, p. 16, para. 59 (quoting *Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Occidental Exploration and Production Company v*. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 61.)\n\n13.\n\nAs to the rights to be preserved, the Applicant argues that it seeks to preserve its right that the dispute between the Parties not be aggravated by the Respondents; that the dispute between the Parties not be transformed from a legal to a public, political forum; and that the Applicant\u2019s representatives not be harassed or their attention not be diverted from preparation of their pleadings in these annulment proceedings.15\n\nApplication, p. 16, para. 60.\n\n14.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the requirements of urgency and necessity are also met. According to the Applicant, the matter is \"urgent\" as it is \"likely\" that the Respondents will take further action prejudicial to the rights of Zimbabwe before a final decision is issued in these annulment proceedings.\"16 Moreover, as the Applicant\u2019s right not to be intimidated during the course of these proceedings \"can never be fully remedied by compensation,\" there is also a risk of irreparable harm if the Applicant\u2019s request is not granted.17\n\nApplication, p. 18, para. 71.\n\nApplication, pp. 18-19, paras. 72-75.\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant also stresses the importance of \"keeping the debates and documents among the parties and ICSID,\" citing various provisions of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules and ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, which address *inter alia* the confidentiality obligation of the members of ICSID tribunals and *ad hoc* committees, secrecy of deliberations, and the publication of ICSID awards.18 The Applicant also cites to a series of decisions in other ICSID cases, including *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* in which the arbitral tribunal recommended provisional measures to protect confidentiality and integrity of the proceedings, and in order to avoid aggravation of the dispute.19 However, while the Applicant refers to, and \"reiterates,\" its requests to the Committees in its annulment application of 21 October 2015, its formal request for relief in the Application does not contain requests relating specifically to confidentiality.20\n\nApplication, pp. 10-14, paras. 41-53.\n\nApplication, pp. 12-13, para. 49. *See Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3, 29 Sept. 2006.\n\nApplication, pp. 19-20, para. 79.\n\n16.\n\nIn conclusion, the Applicant requests that the *ad hoc* Committees \"order and declare\" that the Respondents and their counsel:\n\na. \"have not respected the *status quo;*\n\nb. cease and desist arguing issues subject to these Annulment Proceedings in the press;\n\nc. not further aggravate the dispute or the Applicant;\n\nd. not frustrate the eventual annulment decision; and\n\ne. maintain the *status quo.*\"21\n\nApplication, p. 1 and p. 20.\n\n**B. The Respondents\u2019 Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1.Response to the Applicant\u2019s Factual Allegations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondents suggest that the only dispute between the Parties as to facts is whether the publication of the von Pezold Award on 10 February 2016 was made possible by the disclosure of this award by the Applicant or the Respondents. However, according to the Respondents, this issue is irrelevant because ICSID awards are not confidential.22\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 4.\n\n18.\n\nIn any event, the Respondents deny that they \"leaked\" the von Pezold Award.23 The Respondents accept that the von Pezold Award was exhibited to the Bailey Affidavit on 20 August 2015, but claim that this was consistent with the \"best evidence rule\" that applies in Zimbabwe. Moreover, there was no wider publication of the von Pezold Award at the time, and the Applicant did not complain about this particular disclosure until six months later, on 23 February 2016.24\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 4.\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 5.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondents explain that their lead counsel, Mr Matthew Coleman, was contacted by two different journalists in September and October 2015, but refused to disclose the Awards.25 In February 2016, he was again approached by a journalist who informed him that the von Pezold Award had been published on *ITA Law,* and that a series of articles on the Award were to be published on the *IA Reporter.* Mr. Coleman informed the Applicant\u2019s lead counsel, Mr Philip Kimbrough, of these developments, adding that \"it was someone in the Zimbabwean Government that provided the von Pezold Award to third parties.\"26 According to the Respondents, this was consistent with the fact that material from the original arbitration proceedings had been previously published by settlers opposing the Respondents in local court proceedings, which suggested that someone in the Zimbabwean Government was providing materials to third parties.27 In the circumstances, once the von Pezold Award had been published, there was no bar for the Respondents to comment on it as it was already in the public domain.\n\nResponse, p. 2, para. 6.\n\nResponse, p. 3, para. 9.\n\nResponse, p. 3, para. 9.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the quotes their counsel supplied were measured and fully accurate, and the one rhetorically charged phrase attributed to them (the reference to an \"outright land-grab\" in the article appearing in *The Times of London)* was not a quote actually made by the Respondents\u2019 counsel.28 Similarly, while there were minor inaccuracies in the articles published in the *Global Arbitration Review* and *Law360,* these were \"not the fault of the VPBs.\"29\n\nResponse, p. 5, para. 14.\n\nResponse, p. 6, para. 17.\n\n**2.Response to the Applicant\u2019s Legal Argument**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondents note that *ad hoc* committees do not have power under Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention to order provisional measures, as Article 47 is not one of the provisions of the ICSID Convention that apply to annulment proceedings. However, they nevertheless accept that annulment committees have the power to issue provisional measures pursuant to Article 44 of ICSID Convention (which is referred to in Article 52(4) of the Convention) and, alternatively, based on their inherent power to ensure the integrity of the proceedings.30 According to the Respondents, the supporting rule in both circumstances is Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.31\n\nResponse, p.7, para. 19. Under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, \"[a]ny arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\nRule 39 deals with provisional measures.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondents state that they accept that, in order for the Committees to order interim relief, the Applicant must:\n\na. \"identify the substantive and procedural right that requires protection;\n\nb. establish that the measures proposed are urgent; and\n\nc. show that there is necessity, i.e., if the provisional measures are not ordered, there will be irreparable damage to the rights that Zimbabwe seeks to protect.\"32\n\nResponse, p. 7, para. 20.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondents also argue that, in order to be in a position to recommend provisional measures, the Committees must have jurisdiction over the Applicant\u2019s annulment applications; however, the Respondents accept that this is the case here.33\n\nResponse, p. 7, para. 21.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the interim relief sought by the Applicant is neither urgent nor necessary. There is no urgency because the Applicant did not seek interim relief as soon as it filed the annulment applications, even if the von Pezold Award (exhibited to the Bailey Affidavit) had been submitted already on 20 August 2015.34\n\nResponse, pp. 18-19, para. 49.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondents agree that \"[i]t is well-established that there is a right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute,\" however this right, which is \"a single right,\" is limited in scope.35 It is established in ICSID jurisprudence that this right \"only applies in respect of actions that would render the resolution of the dispute by the tribunal more difficult.\"36 Provisional measures may therefore only be ordered \"in regard to those aspects of a party\u2019s behavior that aggravate the dispute to such an extent that it would make resolution of the dispute by the tribunal more difficult: in other words, mere aggravation of the dispute between the parties ... or a mere change in the *status quo* is not enough.\"37 According to the Respondents, no such circumstances exist in this case. The Respondents also confirm that they \"have no intention of aggravating the dispute between the parties to such an extent that it would make resolution of the dispute more difficult.\"38\n\nResponse, pp. 20-21, paras. 52, 55.\n\nResponse, p. 21, para. 58.\n\nResponse, p. 21, para. 58.\n\nResponse, p. 28, para. 76.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondents accept that the Parties have the right for the dispute to be resolved before the Committees and not in some other manner. However, they deny that the comments made by the Respondents\u2019 counsel in the press bear any connection to the issues before the Committees. Nor have they transformed, or risk transforming, the dispute before the Committees from a legal to a public, political forum.39\n\nResponse, p. 28, paras. 78-79.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondents also accept that, in order to ensure the integrity of the proceedings, the Parties have the right not to be harassed by each other.40 However, they deny that the mere publication of articles in the press on an award that has been published online can constitute harassment.41 Moreover, while speaking to the press, the Respondents \"merely exercised their right to free speech in a reasonable, calm and respectful manner.\"42 The Respondents also claim that, if the publication of the articles diverted the Applicant\u2019s attention from preparing its pleadings on the stay, this was not as a result of the Respondents\u2019 actions or even the media coverage of the von Pezold Award, but rather a consequence of the Applicant\u2019s decision to make its Application when, in the Respondents\u2019 view, it had no basis for doing so.43\n\nResponse, p. 29, para. 80.\n\nResponse, p. 29, para. 81.\n\nResponse, p. 29, para. 81.\n\nResponse, p. 30, para. 84.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondents also deny that the provisional measures sought by the Applicant are necessary. According to the Respondents, \"[t]o the extent that Zimbabwe has the rights which it has pleaded (which the VPBs deny), the VPBs accept that the breach of those rights could not be remedied by the payment of damages.\"44\n\nResponse, p. 31, para. 86.\n\n29.\n\nFinally, although the Applicant does not specifically request in its prayer of relief that the annulment proceedings be kept confidential, the Respondents have assumed so for purposes of their submission, given the many references to confidentiality in the Application. In this connection, the Respondents clarify that \"it is not the VBPs\u2019 intention to disclose during the course of the Annulment Proceedings the pleadings or other documents filed by the parties during the course of the Arbitrations or the Annulment Proceedings.\"45 The Respondents also deny that there has been any agreement between the Parties as to confidentiality, and that the various provisions of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules and Administrative and Financial Regulations cited by the Applicant do not establish a general obligation of confidentiality binding on parties to ICSID arbitration or ICSID annulment proceedings, nor is there support for any such obligation in ICSID jurisprudence.46 According to the Respondents, \"[t]ailored confidentiality requirements have only been imposed to maintain the integrity of the proceedings and/or to prevent the aggravation of the dispute in extreme circumstances.\"47\n\nResponse, p. 8, para. 24.\n\nResponse, pp. 9-18, paras. 25-48.\n\nResponse, p. 17, para. 45.\n\n**III.** **The** ***ad hoc*** **Committees\u2019 Analysis**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s Application raises an issue that has also arisen before other *ad hoc* committees, but which has not yet been decided, as to whether an ICSID *ad hoc* committee is competent to recommend provisional measures in the first place.48 The issue arises because Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which deals with ICSID tribunals\u2019 power to recommend provisional measures, is not among the provisions listed in Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention which \"shall apply *mutatis mutandis*\" to proceedings before ICSID annulment committees. The omission of Article 47 from the list of the relevant provisions in Article 52(4) suggests that the power of ICSID annulment committees to recommend provisional measures has been intentionally excluded, possibly because under Article 52(5) of the Convention they may stay enforcement of an award pending their decision on annulment, which is effectively a special form of interim relief.49\n\n*See generally* Mallory Silberman, \"Annulment: What Are the Rules on the Rules,\" 10 June 2013, Kluwer Arbitration Blog, http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com.\n\n*See* Christoph Schreuer with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair: \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" 2nd edition, p. 1055.\n\n31.\n\nHowever, the matter is complicated by Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides that \"[t]he provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\" One of such rules applicable *mutatis mutandis* is Rule 39, which deals with provisional measures in great detail. The Respondents further suggest that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention is also relevant in this context as it establishes that \"[a]ny arbitration proceedings [and presumably therefore also any annulment proceedings] shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section.\" The Section in question (Section 3 of the ICSID Convention) contains Article 47, which as noted above deals with provisional measures.\n\n32.\n\nThe Committees note in this connection that the Parties agree that the Committees would have, at the very least, an inherent power to recommend provisional measures necessary to protect the integrity of the present proceedings. However, in view of the conclusions reached below, the Committees do not consider it necessary to rule on this issue.\n\n33.\n\nWhen reaching their decision, the Committees have carefully considered the Applicant\u2019s Application, the supporting evidence and the legal argument submitted by the Applicant in support of its Application. The Committees are not persuaded that any provisional measures are required in the circumstances, and in any event the Applicant has not demonstrated that such circumstances exist.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, the Applicant has not demonstrated that the Respondents or their legal counsel are responsible for the alleged \"leak\" of the von Pezold Award to the public domain. The disclosure of the von Pezold Award in the proceedings before the Zimbabwe High Court cannot justifiably be considered an illegitimate \"leak\" as such disclosure was made for purposes of pursuing or protecting a legal right. In any event, ICSID awards are not confidential as such. Even if the ICSID Secretariat may publish an ICSID award only with the consent of the parties, it may publish excerpts of the legal reasoning of the tribunal without their express consent; see Rule 48(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Moreover, unless the parties have specifically agreed otherwise, either party may make the award publicly available, and indeed, this appears to be the way in which ICSID awards often become public in practice.\n\n35.\n\nSecond, the Committees are not persuaded that the statements made by the Respondents\u2019 legal counsel in the media were of such a nature as to aggravate the present dispute, or otherwise threaten the integrity of the present annulment proceedings. Indeed, parties to ICSID annulment proceedings must be considered to be entitled to comment on the ICSID award in question to the media, so long as this is done in a manner that does not amount to an attempt to litigate the pending annulment proceedings in the public domain, or in a manner that may otherwise aggravate the dispute. There is no evidence that this has occurred in the present case. Nor is there any evidence that the publication of the von Pezold Award or the statements made by the Respondents\u2019 counsel to the press would tend to frustrate the *ad hoc* Committees\u2019 eventual decision in these annulment proceedings. The Applicant\u2019s Application therefore stands to be dismissed.\n\n36.\n\nNonetheless, mindful of the importance and sensitivity of the matter before it, the Committees consider it appropriate to remind the Parties of their general obligation not to take any action during the pendency of these annulment proceedings that may aggravate the dispute. In this connection, the Committees note the Respondents\u2019 assurance that \"it is not the VPBs\u2019 intention to disclose during the course of the Annulment Proceedings the pleadings or other documents filed by the parties during the course of the Arbitrations or the Annulment Proceedings.\"50 The Committees take note of the Respondents\u2019 undertaking and expect that both Parties share and respect the spirit of this undertaking in the course of these annulment proceedings.\n\nResponse, p. 8, para. 24.\n\n**IV.** **Decision**\n--------------------\n\n37.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committees decide as follows:\n\na. The Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures is dismissed; and\n\nb. The Parties are reminded of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2016-10-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.** **Procedure**\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Republic of Zimbabwe (the **\"Applicant\")** filed applications for annulment (the **\"Annulment Applications\")** and requests for stay of enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the **\"von Pezold Award\"** and the **\"Border Timbers Award,\"** respectively, and together the **\"Awards\")** pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committees (the **\"Committees\")** in these matters were constituted on 21 December 2015. The Committees conducted a joint first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceedings. In particular, Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n\"The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part ('Part I\u2019) shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings. The second part ('Part II\u2019) shall deal with the Applicant\u2019s applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.\"\n\n3.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting an order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties\u2019 filing of further observations on the matter.\n\n4.\n\nBy a letter dated 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committees, informing the Parties of the Committees\u2019 decision to deny the Applicant\u2019s request for an interim order and inviting Bernhard von Pezold and others and Border Timbers Limited and others (the **\"Respondents\"** or **\"VPBs\")** to submit their response to the application by 2 March 2016.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, the Respondents filed their response to the Applicant\u2019s application.\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the Committees issued a Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures. The Committees dismissed the application, while reminding the Parties of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, on 4 April 2016, the Applicant filed its Memorial in Support of Continuing the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the **\"Memorial on Stay\"),** together with Exhibits ZA-072 to ZA-113 and Legal Authorities ZALEX-061 to ZALEX-072.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, the Respondents filed a Counter-Memorial on Stay (the **\"Counter-Memorial on Stay\"),** together with Exhibits VPB-10 to VPB-26 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-18 to VPBLEX-57.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, the Applicant filed a Reply to VPB\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Stay of Enforcement (the **\"Reply on Stay\").** On 7 July 2016, the Applicant submitted a revised version of its Reply, together with Exhibits ZA-114 to ZA-151, including witness statements by Dr J.P. Mangudya, Attorney General Prince Machaya and Mr Zvinechimwe Churu (ZA-121, ZA-137 and ZA-144, respectively) and Legal Authorities ZALEX-073 to ZALEX-077.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 July 2016, the Respondents filed a Rejoinder on Stay (the **\"Rejoinder on Stay\"),** together with Exhibits VPB-027 to VPB-043, including a witness statement by Mr Heinrich Bernd Alexander Josef von Pezold (VPB-32), and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-058 to VPBLEX-068.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I (the **\"Application\").**\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with an invitation from the Committees, on 23 September 2016, the Respondents filed a Response to Zimbabwe\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures (References to the Merits) (the **\"Response\").**\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 26 September 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties advising them that the Committees would rule on the Application on the basis of the record before them.\n\n**II.** **Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicant\u2019s Application**\n----------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Application arises out of references made in the Respondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Stay and Rejoinder on Stay to the merits of the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications, in the context of whether or not the applications should be considered dilatory or otherwise *prima facie* without any merit. The Applicant requests that the Committees \"order and declare that the consideration of the merits of the Annulment Applications is excluded from Part I of these Annulment proceedings and thus fully reserved for Part II of these Proceedings,\" in accordance with Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1.1\n\nApplication, para. 1.\n\n15.\n\nIn support of its Application, the Applicant relies on Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.2 The Applicant also refers to the Parties\u2019 earlier submissions in which they addressed the issue that gives rise to the Applicant\u2019s Application and requested that the Committees resolve the matter.3\n\nApplication, para. 2.\n\nApplication, para. 3 (referring to the Reply on Stay, para. 321, and to the Rejoinder on Stay, para. 49).\n\n16.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Application is urgent as there is an \"urgent need to protect the serenity of the proceedings,\" the Respondents having confirmed in their Rejoinder on Stay their \"intent... to debate the merits of the Annulment Applications\" in Part I of these proceedings, contrary to Procedural Order No. 1.4 The Applicant argues that, unless the Committees grant the requested relief, the remaining steps in this Part I of the proceedings \"promise to be unnecessarily chaotic and disorderly and to prejudice Applicant\u2019s right to due process.\"5\n\nApplication, paras. 5 and 6.\n\nApplication, para. 9.\n\n17.\n\nThe Applicant adds that the Application is timely, as Procedural Order No. 1 \"suspended the calendar during the month of August.\"6\n\nApplication, para. 10.\n\n18.\n\nAs to the rights to be preserved, the Applicant argues that it seeks to protect its \"full right to present the merits concerning the Annulment Applications ... in the manner stipulated in [Procedural Order No. 1].\"7 In the alternative, \"were the Committees to instruct the Parties to discuss any part of the merits in Part I of these proceedings,\" the Applicant\u2019s rights to be preserved also include \"to know the scope of any such discussion of the merits in Part I.\"8 This is necessary in order for the Applicant to be able to prepare its written and oral submissions for the remaining steps of Part I of these annulment proceedings.9\n\nApplication, paras. 11 and 12.\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicant argues that its Application also meets the requirement of necessity, \"as irreparable harm would result\" if the scope of the remaining steps in Part I are not clarified.10 According to the Applicant, \"[i]n view of VPB\u2019s decision to argue the merits\" in Part I, if the requested provisional measures are not granted, the Applicant\u2019s right to due process would be harmed as it would not be in a position to respond before a final decision is given.11 This harm would be irreparable as the \"Applicant\u2019s right to know the scope of Skeleton Arguments and Oral Arguments on Stay in due time during the course of these proceedings, can never be fully remedied by compensation.\"12\n\nApplication, para. 15.\n\nApplication, para. 16.\n\nApplication, paras. 17 and 18.\n\n20.\n\nThe Applicant also addresses in detail the Respondents\u2019 submissions that give rise to the Application. It contends that the Respondents should have raised their argument that the Annulment Applications are manifestly unfounded under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), which requires such arguments to be raised within 30 days of the constitution of the Committees. As they did not do so, the Respondents are \"now foreclosed from doing so.\"13 In any event, the Respondents\u2019 own lengthy submissions demonstrate that the Annulment Applications are not manifestly unfounded or dilatory.14 In the circumstances, the Respondents\u2019 decision to argue the merits of the case in this Part I of the proceedings \"severely prejudges the merits to an extent that deprives Applicant of its due process right to serenely present its case on the merits in Part II of these proceedings as stipulated by [Procedural Order No. 1].\"15\n\nApplication, para. 21.\n\nApplication, paras. 24 and25.\n\nApplication, para. 22.\n\n21.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the issues raised by its Annulment Applications are \"heavy and substantive\" and therefore not suitable for \"summary disposition on a *prima facie* basis.\"16 Citing the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Libananco v. Turkey,* the Applicant submits that the Respondents\u2019 \"dilatory test\" is not sound; it applies only if a stay application has been brought without any basis under the Convention.17 According to the Applicant, \"given the universal nature of VPB\u2019s arguments on the merits any *prima facie* decision on a less than complete presentation of Applicant\u2019s full case ..., gravely impinges upon its right to present the merits and would unduly and severely prejudge the case and its rights, as the issues involved are too heavy a topic to be addressed in a summary fashion.\"18 Citing *Amoco Iran International Finance Corporation v. Iran* and *AAP v. Sri Lanka,* the Applicant argues that it is not possible to rely on a *prima facie* test \"when a legal matter should be proven in a conclusive manner.\"19\n\nApplication, paras. 29-43.\n\nApplication, para. 32 (citing *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v*. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 May 2012), VBLEX-61.

The Respondents\u2019 Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondents state that they agree with the Applicant that the Committees have the power to order provisional measures under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which is applicable pursuant to Article 52(4) of the Convention, and under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.25\n\nResponse, para. 6.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondents further accept that, in order for the Committees to order interim relief, the Applicant must:\n\n(a) \"identify the substantive and procedural right that requires protection;\n\n(b) establish that the measures proposed are urgent; and\n\n(c) show that there is necessity, i.e., that if the provisional measures are not ordered there will be irreparable damage to the rights that Zimbabwe seeks to protect.\"26\n\nResponse, para. 7.\n\n28.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Respondents, the Committees must have *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications. For the purpose of the present Application, the Respondents accept that this is the case here, while reserving their right to argue at a later stage of the proceedings that the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications \"are not within the confines of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"27\n\nResponse, para. 8.\n\n29.\n\nAs to the rights to be preserved, the Respondents also agree that the Parties\u2019 procedural rights arising under Procedural Order No. 1, specifically the rights arising under Section 15 which provides that the proceedings shall consist of two phases, \"are rights that may be protected by an order for provisional measures.\"28 However, the Respondents deny that they have breached Procedural Order No. 1 and therefore request that the Application be denied.29\n\nResponse, para. 10.\n\nResponse, paras. 9-12.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondents recall that the Applicant in its Memorial on Stay and Reply on Stay argued that the Annulment Applications are not dilatory in nature and that this is relevant in deciding whether or not the stays should be lifted. The Respondents conclude from this that the Parties in fact agree that the requests for stay should not be granted if the Committees find that the Annulment Applications are dilatory. According to the Respondents, under Section 15 of Procedural Order No. 1 neither Party was prevented from arguing and applying the legal test which determines whether or not an annulment application is dilatory (the **\"Dilatory Test\"),** as \"such a test does not prejudge the merits.\"30 The Respondents add that, \"[t]o the extent that the VPBs refer to the merits of [the Annulment Applications],\" they do so \"only for the purpose of and in accordance with the Dilatory Test; they do not seek a final determination of the merits as the Dilatory Test neither requires nor permits such a determination.\"31 The Respondents argue that they have therefore not breached the Applicant\u2019s procedural rights, as they \"have merely responded to the legal argument raised by Zimbabwe as to the application of the Dilatory Test.\"32\n\nResponse, para. 13.\n\nResponse, para. 14.\n\nResponse, para. 14.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Applicant appears to have misunderstood the Dilatory Test. The Respondents are not seeking a disposal of the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), as a successful application of Rule 41(5) would bring the proceedings to an end, whereas \"a finding by the Committees that the Annulment Applications are dilatory does not.\"33\n\nResponse, para. 17.\n\n32.\n\nAs to the urgency requirement, the Respondents agree that the Application is urgent as it seeks protection of a procedural right. However, the Respondents argue that the Applicant has waived its right to seek protection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. The Respondents note that they had first addressed the Dilatory Test in their Counter-Memorial on Stay, which was filed on 11 June 2016. However, the Applicant waited over three months before filing the Application and thus \"has waived its right to object to the manner in which the VPBs have referred to the merits in their pleadings.\"34 In this connection, the Respondents refer to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, which provides that \"[a] party which knows or should have known\" that any applicable procedural rule has not been complied with, but \"which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed ... to have waived its right to object.\"35\n\nResponse, paras. 18-20.\n\nResponse, para. 18.\n\n33.\n\nAs to the requirement of necessity, the Respondents accept that \"to the extent that Zimbabwe has the right which it has pleaded (which is denied), ... the breach of that right could not be remedied by the payment of damages.\"36\n\nResponse, para. 21.\n\n34.\n\nFinally, in response to the further relief requested by the Applicant, the Respondents argue that:\n\n(a) The Applicant\u2019s request for \"clarification and confirmation of the scope\" of Procedural Order No. 1 is not a procedural or substantive right and therefore \"not amenable to an order on provisional measures;\"37\n\n(b) The Applicant\u2019s alternative request to join Part I to Part II is also not a procedural or substantive right of the Applicant. The Parties must comply with the procedural calendar set by the Committees, \"unless there are reasonable grounds for not being able to do so.\" According to the Respondents, no such grounds have been argued by the Applicant;38 and\n\n(c) Finally, should the Committees decide that the Respondents have not breached Procedural Order No. 1 by addressing the Dilatory Test, there is no need for further submissions on the merits of the Annulment Applications or guidance from the Committees as the matters would have been dealt with appropriately in the pleadings to date. Further pleadings in Part I would also jeopardize the procedural timetable set by the Committees in Procedural Order No. 1.39\n\nResponse, para. 23.\n\nResponse, para. 24.\n\nResponse, para. 25.\n\n35.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondents request that \"the Committees deny the Application.\"40\n\nResponse, para. 26.\n\n**III.** **The** ***ad hoc*** **Committees\u2019 Analysis**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn their Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated 17 March 2016, the Committees noted that the Applicant\u2019s application \"raised an issue that has also arisen before other *ad hoc* committees, but which has not yet been decided, as to whether an ICSID *ad hoc* committee is competent to recommend provisional measures in the first place.\"41 Having further considered the issue, the Committees noted that, while the Parties agreed that the Committees \"would have, at the very least, an inherent power to recommend provisional measures necessary to protect the integrity of the present proceedings,\" in view of the conclusions reached in the Decision, the Committees did not consider it necessary to rule on the issue.42\n\nDecision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2016, para. 30.\n\nDecision on the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2016, para. 32.\n\n37.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties continue to agree in the context of the Applicant\u2019s present Application that the Committees have the power to order provisional measures under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which is applicable pursuant to Article 52(4) of the Convention, and under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39. For the reasons set out below, the Committees do not consider it necessary to take a view on this issue at this time.\n\n38.\n\nThe Committees have carefully considered the Parties\u2019 submissions and the supporting evidence and legal authorities and, for the reasons set out below, have reached the conclusion that there is no basis to recommend provisional measures, even assuming the Committees had the power to recommend such measures.\n\n39.\n\nThe Applicant in its Application argues that the Respondents in their Counter-Memorial on Stay and Rejoinder on Stay have improperly attempted to argue the merits of the Applicant\u2019s Annulment Applications, in breach of the Committees\u2019 decision in Procedural Order No. 1 to bifurcate the present annulment proceedings and to deal with the Applicant\u2019s requests for continuation of the stay in Part I of the proceedings.43 The Applicant in particular objects to the way in which, or the extent to which, the Respondents have argued the issue as to whether or not the Annulment Applications should be considered \"dilatory, trivial, frivolous and/or abusive.\"\n\nThe Applicant refers, specifically, to Counter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 28-69 and Reply on Stay, paras. 28-44.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondents argue, in response, that they have merely replied to the Applicant\u2019s own argument in its Counter-Memorial on Stay and Reply on Stay, to the effect that its Annulment Applications are not dilatory, trivial or frivolous, and do not constitute an abuse of process.44\n\nResponse, para. 13 (referring to the Applicant\u2019s Memorial on Stay, paras. 2-12 and Reply on Stay, paras. 279, 295, 298-299, 301 and 359).\n\n41.\n\nThe Committees note that the Applicant raised in its Memorial on Stay the issue of whether its Annulment Applications meet what it referred to as \"threshold criteria\" of not being dilatory, trivial or frivolous, or an abuse of process.45 The Applicant argued that these criteria were met in this case. The Respondents then responded to these arguments in the Counter-Memorial on Stay, agreeing that these were the \"threshold criteria\" for the continuation of a stay.46 The Respondents then went on to argue that the Annulment Applications indeed were, in their view, \"dilatory, trivial, frivolous and/or abusive.\"47 The Applicant presented further argument on the issue in its Reply on Stay,48 and the Respondents replied in the Rejoinder on Stay.49\n\nMemorial on Stay, paras. 2-12.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, para. 28.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 33-69.\n\nReply on Stay, in particular paras. 292-301.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, paras. 6-44.\n\n42.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondents argued in their Rejoinder on Stay that the Applicant \"appear[ed] to acknowledge that an application will be dilatory if it is 'manifestly abusive,\u2019 'baseless\u2019 (i.e. no *prima facie* case) or 'an abuse of process.\u2019\"50 The Respondents indicated that, \"to the extent that the additional two criteria ('trivial\u2019 and 'frivolous\u2019) are not covered by the Non-Dilatory Requirement,\" they \"take no position on whether or not the jurisprudence on stays of enforcement supports them or as to whether or not they have been met in the present circumstances.\"51 Consequently, in the Respondents\u2019 view, the sole \"threshold criterion\" issue that remains before the Committees \"is whether or not the Non-Dilatory Requirement has been met.\"52\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 6 (footnotes omitted).\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 7.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 8.\n\n43.\n\nThe Committees note that both Parties have taken in their submissions the view that, in order for the Committees to be able to grant the Applicant\u2019s requests for continuation of the stay, the Annulment Applications must meet certain \"threshold criteria.\" While the Parties do not agree on whether these criteria have been met, they appear to agree that the application of these criteria will require the Committees to make a preliminary or *prima facie* determination as to whether or not the Annulment Applications meet these \"threshold criteria.\" Thus, the Applicant in its Memorial on Stay argues:\n\n\"Applicant has established in its Annulment Applications that there is *prima facie* a reasonable case for seeking annulment, as the grounds and facts on which Applicant relies in the Annulment Application, if proved, lead to annulment. Although Applicant does not request and the *ad hoc* Committees are not in a position during this preliminary phase of proceedings to decide on the merits of the Applicants Annulment Applications, on their face, *prima facie,* were the facts and law Applicant presented to be proven, one can reasonably envisage the possibility that the Awards be overturned.\"53\n\nMemorial on Stay, para. 3. See also paras. 5, 12.\n\n44.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondents state in their Counter-Memorial on Stay:\n\n\"In its Memorial on Stay, Zimbabwe argues that the Annulment Application are not dilatory in nature, trivial, frivolous or an abuse of process. It groups these matters under the notion of 'threshold criteria\u2019 for the continuation of a stay on enforcement, as indeed they are.\n\n...\n\n[W]here an annulment application is dilatory, trivial, frivolous and/or abusive, a stay of enforcement will not be ordered; but meeting these low hurdles is not a factor in favour of ordering such a stay.\"54\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 28, 30 (footnotes omitted).\n\n45.\n\nTherefore, the issue on which the Parties disagree is not whether an annulment application must meet certain \"threshold criteria\" for a request for continuation of a stay to be granted, but whether the Respondents, when responding to the Applicant\u2019s argument on this issue, have strayed beyond addressing the \"threshold criteria\" and have argued the merits of the Annulment Applications. That this is the subject matter of the dispute between the Parties is evident from the Applicant\u2019s Reply on Stay, where the Applicant contends that \"[the Respondents\u2019] arguments [in the Counter-Memorial on Stay] focus on issues totally outside the 'threshold\u2019 tests regarding the stay\" and are \"directly pertinent to the merits of its case to be addressed in these proceedings during Phase II.\"55 According to the Applicant, \"VPB simply could not resist its urge to counter Applicant\u2019s reasoning in its Annulment Applications until the time it agreed to do so, as reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 .\"56\n\nReply on Stay, para. 296.\n\nReply on Stay, para. 296.\n\n46.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties therefore concerns the legal criteria to be applied by the Committees in determining whether or not to grant the Applicant\u2019s requests that the stay of enforcement of the Awards be continued. While the Committees cannot make any determination on this issue at this stage of the proceedings, they note that, even assuming the Committees were to conclude that, for the Applicant to be able to prevail on its requests for the continuation of the stay, its Annulment Applications must meet certain substantive threshold criteria (and the Committees take no view at this stage on the content or indeed the existence of any such threshold criteria), the Committees\u2019 decision on any such threshold criteria would merely be relevant in determining whether the Applicant\u2019s requests for continuation of the stay may or may not be granted; as a determination on this preliminary issue it would not, and indeed could not, prejudge the Committees\u2019 decision on the merits of the Annulment Applications, which will be briefed by the Parties and resolved by the Committees in Part II of these annulment proceedings. In these circumstances, there cannot be any risk that the Committees\u2019 decision could cause irreparable harm on the Applicant\u2019s right to present its case on the merits, which is the right that the Applicant seeks to protect by its Application.\n\n47.\n\nConsequently, the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of Merits in Part I stands to be dismissed.\n\n**IV.** **Decision**\n--------------------\n\n48.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committees decide that the Applicant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I is dismissed.\n\nDate: 13 October 2016"}, {"Title": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2017-04-24T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Applicant filed applications for annulment (the \"**Annulment Applications**\") and requests for stay of enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the \"**von Pezold Award**,\" and together with the \"**Border Timbers Award**,\" the \"**Awards**\") pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nOn 2 November 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Applications and at the same time notified the parties that enforcement of the Awards was provisionally stayed, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n3.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"**Committee**\") was constituted in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(3). The members of the Committee are Dr Veijo Heiskanen, President, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Finland, Ms Jean Kalicki, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Hungary, and Professor Azzedine Kettani, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council. All members were appointed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council. On the same date, Bernhard von Pezold and others and Border Timbers Limited and others (the \"**Respondents**\" or \"**VPBs**\") and Zimbabwe (the \"**Applicant**\") (together, the \"**Parties**\") were duly informed of the commencement of the annulment proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nThe Committee conducted a joint first session with the Parties and the Secretary of the Committee by telephone conference on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceeding. In particular, Section 15.l of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n\"The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part ('Part I') shall deal with the Applicant's request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings. The second part ('Part II') shall deal with the Applicant's applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.\"\n\n5.\n\nMoreover, Section l of Procedural Order No. 1 provides that the Annulment Applications would be conjoined and heard together. More specifically, Section 1.7 of Procedural Order No.1 foresees that:\n\n\"The Committees shall issue separate decisions in relation to each Award but may nevertheless discuss these proceedings in decisions or procedural orders as a single set of proceedings, except where circumstances necessitate separate treatment.\"\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting an order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"**First Application**\"). Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties' filing of further observations on the matter. By letter of 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee's decision to deny the Applicant's request for an interim order. On 2 March 2016, the Respondents filed a response to the First Application, requesting that the application be denied. The proceedings relating to the First Application are set out in detail in the Committee's Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures, which was transmitted to the Parties on 17 March 2016. In their Decision, the Committee dismissed the First Application, stating that \"[t]he Committees are not persuaded that any provisional measures are required in the circumstances, and in any event the Applicant has not demonstrated that such circumstances exist.\"1 The Committee also reminded the Parties of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings.\n\nDecision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures dated 17 March 2016, para. 33\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, on 4 April 2016, the Applicant filed its Memorial in Support of Continuing the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Memorial on Stay**\"), together with Exhibits ZA-072 to ZA-113 and Legal Authorities ZALEX-061 to ZALEX-072.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, the Respondents filed their Counter-Memorial on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Counter-Memorial on Stay**\"), together with Exhibits VPB-010 to VPB-026 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-018 to VPBLEX-057.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, the Applicant filed its Reply on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Reply on Stay**\"). On 7 July 2016, the Applicant submitted a revised version of its Reply, together with Exhibits ZA-114 to ZA-151, including witness statements by Dr J.P. Mangudya, Attorney General Prince Machaya and Mr Zvinechimwe Chum (Exhibits ZA-121, ZA-137 and ZA-144, respectively), and Legal Authorities ZALEX-073 to ZALEX-077.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 July 2016, the Respondents filed their Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Rejoinder on Stay**\"), together with Exhibits VPB-027 to VPB-043, including a witness statement by Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-032), and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-058 to VPBLEX-068.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I (the \"**Second Application**\"). On 23 September 2016, the Respondents filed a response to the Second Application, requesting that the application be denied. The proceedings in respect of the Second Application are described in detail in the Committee's Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I, which was transmitted to the Parties on 13 October 2016. In its Decision, the Committee dismissed the Second Application, stating that any decision\n\n\"[...] on this preliminary issue [...] would not, and indeed could not, prejudge the Committees' decision on the merits of the Annulment Applications, which will be briefed by the Parties and resolved by the Committees in Part II of these annulment proceedings.

On 18 November 2016, the Committee granted the Applicant's request for leave to file Exhibit ZA-152 and instructed the Respondents to file any observations they might have on that document within five business days of its production. Later that day, the Respondents filed their Skeleton Arguments on Stay (the \"**Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay**\") and the Applicant filed its Skeleton Arguments on Stay (the \"**Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay**\") and also Exhibit ZA-152.\n\n13.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, the Respondents filed their observations on Exhibit ZA-152 in the form of Exhibits VPB-044 to VPB-047 and a witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048).\n\n14.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 30 November 2016, the Committee granted the Applicant leave to file an additional witness statement in response to the Respondents' observations of 25 November 2016.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 December 2016, the Applicant filed an additional witness statement of Dr J.P. Mangudya (Exhibit ZA-153). Together with the witness statement, the Applicant requested a procedural ruling from the Committee in advance of the scheduled hearing regarding alleged hearsay evidence contained in the additional witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048). On 4 December 2016, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's request.\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the Respondents filed their comments on the Applicant's 2 December 2016 request for a procedural ruling from the Committee with respect to the alleged hearsay evidence. The Respondents requested that Exhibit VPB-048 be kept on the record in its entirety or, should the Committee decide to exclude it, then Exhibit ZA-152 be struck from the record as well.\n\n17.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Secretary of the Committee and the Parties by telephone conference. During the call, in addition to discussing logistical arrangements for the upcoming hearing, the Parties agreed that there was no need for the Committee to strike portions of Exhibit VPB-048 from the record.\n\n18.\n\nA joint hearing on the stay of enforcement of the Awards was held in Paris, France, on 14 and 15 December 2016 (the \"**Hearing**\"). In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, the following individuals were present at the Hearing:\n\n*For the Applicant* :\n\nMr Philip Kimbrough Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nMr Tristan Moreau Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nMr Prince Machaya Attorney General, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Fortune Chimbaru Ac ting Direc tor Civil Division, Attorney General's Office, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Elizabeth Sumowah Legal Advis or, Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Varaidzo Zifudzi Principal Dir ector, Le gal Services, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Chrispen Mavodza Director, Legal Affairs Department Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Zvinechimwe Ruvinga Churu Principal Director - Budgets and Acting Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\n*For the Respondents* :\n\nMr Matthew Coleman Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMs Helen Aldridge Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMr Thomas Innes Steptoe & Johnson\n\nMr Charles Verrill\n\nMr Heinrich von Pezold\n\n*Court Reporter* :\n\nMr Trevor McGowan The Court Reporter Ltd.\n\n19.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the following persons were examined:\n\n*On behalf of the Applicant* :\n\nMr Prince Machaya Attorney General, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Willard L.

Following exchanges between the Parties, on 19 January 2017, the Respondents sent directly to the Applicant a request that it produce certain documents, and attached to their request Legal Authority VPBLEX-069. On 2 February 2017, the Respondents sent a further communication directly to the Applicant requesting additional updated information (this letter was subsequently introduced into the record as Exhibit VPB-050).\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, the Applicant produced Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 in response to the Respondents' document production request of 19 January 2017. The Applicant stated that Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 should \"properly inform the Parties without breaching the Applicant's confidentiality obligations.\"\n\n22.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee stating that they did not consider the documents produced by the Applicant to satisfy their request for document production and asked the Committee to determine whether their request had been met. The Respondents also requested leave from the Committee to make observations and file new evidence in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155. On 14 February 2017, the Committee granted the Respondents' request to make observations and file new evidence.\n\n23.\n\nOn 20 February 2017, the Respondents filed an additional witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-049) in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 26 February 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee's decision to deny the Respondents' request for document production, taking note of the Applicant's refusal to produce the documents on grounds of confidentiality. The Committee noted that its decision was without prejudice to the determination, which it would make in due course, as to whether the Applicant had established the facts that the requested documents allegedly support.\n\n25.\n\nThe Applicant filed its Post-Hearing Brief on 9 March 2017 (the \"**Applicant's PostHearing Brief**\"), and the Respondents filed their Post-Hearing Brief on 10 March 2017 (the \"**Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee requesting that certain allegations made in the Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief be disregarded. The Applicant commented on this request by letter dated 6 April 2017. By letter of 10 April 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties that the Committee had decided not to formally disregard the Applicant's allegations, and that it would assess the Applicant's allegations in terms of their relevance to the Applicant's request for stay and the evidentiary record of these annulment proceedings.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Test for determining whether the stay should be maintained**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Applicant submits that under the relevant ICSID jurisprudence a stay of enforcement should only be lifted in exceptional circumstances.3 No such exceptional circumstances exist in this case and the stay should therefore be maintained.4\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 2, 12-13; Memorial on Stay, paras. 38-41, 158; Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 68-73\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 2-4; Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 148 ff.\n\n28.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the language of the ICSID Convention as elaborated upon by ICSID annulment committees contradicts the Respondents' position that the Applicant bears the burden of proving that the stay should be continued.5 The Applicant considers, in particular, that once an applicant for annulment has made a *prima facie* case for having an award annulled, the respondent must show that the annulment application is totally without merit in order to have a stay of enforcement lifted.6\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41; *see also* Memorial on Stay, para. 6.\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 74-84; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41.\n\n29.\n\nThe Applicant considers that it has nonetheless met the burden of establishing the existence of circumstances that require the continuation of the stay of enforcement.7\n\n*See* Reply on Stay, paras. 292-325; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 42-43.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondents submit that a stay is presumptively lifted unless there are special circumstances requiring that it be continued.8 The Respondents argue that, accordingly, \"there must be some circumstances present that speak in favour of granting a stay.\"9\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 107; Counter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 19-27.\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondents contend that it is for the Applicant to establish that there are circumstances that require the stay to remain in place.10 The Respondents draw on the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 54, contending that, because it is the Applicant that requested the continuation of the stay, it is for the Applicant to establish that it should remain in place.11\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22.\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23; Arbitration Rule 54.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondents contest the *MTD* decision,12 to the extent that it found that an applicant does not bear the burden of establishing the necessity of a stay for enforcement where it has given reasonable assurances that it will comply with the award if it is not annulled.13 In any event, the Respondents consider that they would satisfy any burden incumbent upon them to establish that the stay should be lifted, arguing in particular that the Annulment Applications are dilatory, that Zimbabwe would not suffer any hardship through the lifting of the stay and that the VPBs would be prejudiced by the maintenance of the stay.14\n\nZALEX-065, *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v.

The allegedly dilatory nature of the Applicant's annulment applications**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nWhile the Applicant appears to agree with the Respondents that the issue of whether the Annulment Applications have *prima facie* any merit is relevant to the question of whether or not the stay should be maintained, it denies that the standard applies in this case.15\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 97.\n\n34.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that, on the contrary, it has a *prima facie* case for having the Awards annulled because its applications set forth grounds which, if proven, would lead to annulment of the Awards.16 The Applicant submits that this in turn demonstrates that its Annulment Applications are not dilatory.17\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 43(i); Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 74-84, 113-120.\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 119-120; Tr. Day 1, Applicant's Opening Statement, 105:3-107:8.\n\n35.\n\nThe Applicant submits that a demonstration that the Annulment Applications pass the *prima facie* threshold of not being dilatory shifts the burden of proof to the Respondents who would then have to establish that there are nonetheless reasons why the stay should be lifted.18\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41.\n\n36.\n\nThe Applicant also disagrees with the Respondents on a number of other points which, according to the Respondents, show that the Annulment Applications are dilatory and/or abusive. The Applicant argues that its claim for annulment based on non-disclosure cannot be abusive when Mr Fortier, the presiding arbitrator in the underlying arbitration, did not disclose his role as chair of the World Bank Sanctions Board until 548 days after his appointment;19 that there was no waiver because the relevant disclosure came too late in the proceedings;20 that any failure to object does not constitute a bar in annulment proceedings;21 and that the Applicant was indeed denied its right to be heard in relation to its illegality exception because it only had the opportunity to furnish a rushed pleading on this issue.22\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 122-123.\n\nReply on Stay, para. 304.\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 125-127\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 138-145.\n\n37.\n\nThe Applicant further submits that the Respondents' claims that the Annulment Applications are dilatory unduly strays into a consideration of the merits that should not be entertained by the Committee in these stay proceedings.23 According to the Applicant, it is not possible for the Committee to decide that certain grounds listed in the Annulment Applications are dilatory without resolving matters that should only be considered as part of Part II of the proceedings on the merits.24\n\nTr.

Day 1, Respondents' Opening Statement, 146:7-168:9.\n\n39.\n\nAs to the Applicant's first ground for annulment (the allegation that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as Mr Fortier failed to disclose his role as chair of the World Bank Sanctions Board) and as to the second ground (the allegation that the tribunal was improperly constituted tribunal due to Mr Fortier's failure to disclose), the Respondents submit that:\n\na. the parts of the Annulment Applications made on these grounds are dilatory principally as an abuse of process because they bring claims in relation to alleged defects that were waived, that are manifestly unfounded and/or based on a manifestly false assertion;27\n\nb. a *prima facie* analysis reveals that these claims constitute an abuse of process and the Applicant has not proven that they do not;28\n\nc. the Applicant waived its right to raise objections based on Mr Fortier's role by not seeking his disqualification between 31 October 2013 (when he openly stated his role at the hearing) and the closure of proceedings (3 February 2015) or before the dispatch of the award (28 July 2015);29 and\n\nd. the Applicant's bias allegations against Mr Fortier do not meet the \"reasonable third person\" test that should be applied to assess such allegations.30\n\nRespondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 11-26.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, paras. 30, 33; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 14.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 36-39; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 12-15; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 40-41.\n\nRespondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 17-25; Rejoinder on Stay, para. 30.\n\n40.\n\nAs to the Applicant's third ground of annulment, the Respondents argue that the Applicant's allegation that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by determining that Zimbabwe could not rely on the defense of necessity is manifestly false, made in bad faith, an \"abuse of process\" and \"manifestly unfounded.\"31\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 37; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 57.\n\n41.\n\nAs to the Applicant's fourth ground of annulment (the allegation that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to hear Zimbabwe's submissions as to the VPBs' breach of host State law), the Respondents argue that this allegation is also based on a manifestly false assertion, is made in bad faith and, determined on a *prima facie* basis, is an \"abuse of process\" and/or manifestly unfounded.32\n\nRejoinder on Stay, para. 41; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 39; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 58-63.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the Committee can conclude that the Annulment Applications are dilatory without prejudging their merits.33 In any event, even if the Committees found that the Annulment Applications were not dilatory, the Applicant would still have to demonstrate that there are circumstances justifying the maintenance of the stay.34\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 27, 37; Tr.

Risk of non-compliance with the Awards**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that it intends to comply with the Awards if they are not annulled and has provided letters of assurances and testimony to this effect.35 The Applicant argues that these are serious statements of its intention to comply, and that in themselves they disprove the existence of any serious risk of non-compliance.36\n\n*See* Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101.\n\nMemorial on Stay, paras. 101-109; Reply on Stay, paras. 221-222; Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 172; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, Section 2.2.9, para. 112.\n\n44.\n\nThe Applicant states that it would be more likely to be able to comply with the Awards (if they are not annulled) if the stay is maintained as this would allow time for it to complete the debt restructuring which would help it pay all creditors including, in that event, the Respondents.37 In response to the Respondents' allegation that it has failed to comply with previous arbitral awards, the Applicant considers that its past conduct is irrelevant in the context of these stay proceedings, and in any event that its more recent conduct (including settlement of an outstanding ICSID award) demonstrates the likelihood of its compliance in this case.38\n\nReply on Stay, para. 231; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 61.\n\nMemorial on Stay, para. 59; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 47, 58.\n\n45.\n\nThe Applicant further considers that its reengagement with the European Union (\"**EU**\"), along with its clearance of arrears to the International Monetary Fund (\"**IMF**\") and ongoing efforts with other international financial institutions (\"**IFIs**\") demonstrate its commitment to honoring the Awards if they are not annulled.39\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 34-35; *see also* Memorial on Stay, paras. 61-95; Reply on Stay, paras. 200210, 365; and Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 182, 189-191.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondents submit that a \"consideration of the prospects of Zimbabwe complying with the Awards if they are not annulled is 'essential' to whether or not to continue the Stay.\"40 According to the Respondents, the Applicant's assurances do not negate the risk of non-compliance because they \"merely restate what a State is obligated to do under the ICSID Convention.\"41\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 65; *see also* Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 65, 75.\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 80-81; *see also* Rejoinder on Stay, paras. 115-122.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondents argue that Zimbabwe's record of non-compliance with ICSID awards and other international judgments demonstrates a serious risk of non-compliance with the Awards.42 According to the Respondents, this is good evidence of the risk of noncompliance and the past informs the present because there has not been a change of government in Zimbabwe.43\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 90-91; Rejoinder on Stay, paras. 79-92; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 46-50; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 67-73.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, para. 90; Rejoinder on Stay, para. 64; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 45; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondents also point to Zimbabwe's strained relationship with the EU44 and nonpayment of its arrears to IFIs45 as further evidence of the risk of non-compliance.\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 75.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Stay, paras. 113-136; Rejoinder on Stay, paras. 102-114; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 53; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 76.\n\n**D. Hardship to the Applicant if the stay is lifted**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Applicant alleges that it would \"suffer immediate irreparable and/or catastrophic consequences should the stay be lifted.\"46 More specifically, the lifting of the stay would cause \"catastrophic immediate and irreversible consequences for Zimbabwe's ability to conduct its affairs during the course of these proceedings,\" including an inability to pay its costs of bringing them.47\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 48(1) and 48(3); *see also* Applicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 153.\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 153-156.\n\n50.\n\nThe Applicant argues that it would suffer the requisite hardship if the stay were lifted or if a financial guarantee equivalent to the amount owed under the Awards had to be paid, including several types of economic hardship:\n\na. Zimbabwe has strained financial (foreign exchange) resources and the Awards debt, USD 210 million, is substantial;48\n\nb. The award debt constitutes over 5% of Zimbabwe's overall budget, over 25% of its education budget and over 60% of its healthcare budget;49 and\n\nc. Having to pay or freeze the amounts due under the Awards would adversely impact on its ability to finalize its debt restructuring with the EU, the IMF and the World Bank.50\n\nApplicant's Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 153; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief; para. 56.\n\nReply on Stay, para. 333; Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 53-55, 80.\n\nReply on Stay, paras. 240-241, 358.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the impact of the Awards is particularly significant for Zimbabwe, a country with a small economy that has been subjected to sanctions over the last fifteen years. It is therefore not a consequence that would arise in each and every annulment proceeding.51\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 62-63.\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicant contends that if the stay were lifted, it would be required to make restitution of the properties and, if the properties ended up being held in the hands of a complex VPB structure or third party that would likely be difficult to localize, Zimbabwe would be unable to recover them if the Awards were annulled.52\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 81; *see also* Memorial on Stay, paras. 26-37.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Applicant's alleged hardship is in fact an \"enforcement hardship\" and premised on the assumption that the VPBs will have to take enforcement action. According to the Respondents, the Applicant is effectively asking for the Committee to protect it from a consequence of its own failure to make payment as required under the ICSID Convention.53\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 97-98.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondents contest the percentages provided by the Applicant as to the relationship between the amount awarded and Zimbabwe's overall budget54 and contend that the Applicant would not have to pay its Award debts from its education and healthcare budgets,55 but could instead use funds designated for other expenses, such as the President's and Vice-President's salaries.56\n\nRejoinder on Stay, paras. 146-148; Respondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 63.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, paras. 123-153.\n\nRejoinder on Stay, paras. 154-155.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondents further state the amount of the Awards is too small a portion of Zimbabwe's debt for the payment of the amounts due under the Awards to affect its debt restructuring negotiations with the IFIs.57 According to the Respondents, the IFIs to the contrary want Zimbabwe to meet its obligations under the Awards so it should not be trying to avoid them by seeking the continuation of the stay.58\n\nRespondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 72.\n\nTr. Day 1, pp. 236:21-237:20.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondents contend that, in any event, poverty alone does not suffice as hardship,59 and that any economic hardship suffered as a result of lifting the stay is irrelevant where there is a serious risk of non-compliance with the award, which is the case here.60\n\nRespondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 64; Respondents' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 103.\n\nRespondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, paras. 65, 75.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondents argue that there is in fact no prospect of the Applicant having to make restitution of the properties if the stay were lifted, because the 90-day period in which Zimbabwe had the opportunity to make restitution of this property - instead of paying compensation - has expired.61 The Respondents also argue, citing the *Mitchell* decision on the stay of enforcement, that the risk of non-recoupment cannot justify a continuation of a stay on its own.62 The Respondents contend that a restitution hardship, even if established, would only justify the partial continuation of the stay (in particular, the part of the stay preventing the VPBs from seeking title to the properties), not the whole of the stay and that the Committee has discretion under ICSID Convention to only partially lift the stay.63\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 68-69, 88-90.\n\nRespondents' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 87, 91 (citing ZALEX-064, *Patrick Mitchell v.

THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe relevant provision of the ICSID Convention governing an *ad hoc* committee's decision on stay of enforcement is Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. According to this provision, \"[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision.\"\n\n76.\n\nThe procedure for dealing with requests for continuation of stay is set out in Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Rule 54 provides:\n\n\"(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall be automatically terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or\n\n(3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"\n\n77.\n\nThe Parties agree that ICSID *ad hoc* committees have discretion in determining whether or not to continue a stay of enforcement of an ICSID award; this is reflected in the term \"may\" in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention: \"The Committee **may,** if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision\" (emphasis added). In other words, an ICSID *ad hoc* committee may or may not stay enforcement of an award, depending on the circumstances.\n\n78.\n\nThe Committee notes, at the outset, that the language of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention is open-ended in the sense that it does not specify the \"circumstances\" to be taken into account in determining whether or not a stay is required. However, it is apparent from the context that such circumstances must be relevant to the case, and that they must \"require\" a stay. In other words, not just any circumstances, even if relevant to the case, may justify a stay; the circumstances must be sufficiently compelling so as to \"require\" a stay. This is how ICSID *ad hoc* committees have understood the terms of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"Based on the plain language of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules on annulment, it is clear to the Committee that a continued stay of enforcement of the award is not, in any event, automatic. Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, a continued stay is dependent on the specific circumstances of the case. Indeed, to order the continuation of the provisional stay, the Committee must be convinced that within the context of the case at hand such continuation is required.... The Committee also notes that Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the stay shall only be continued if the Committee considers that 'the circumstances so **require**.' The Convention does not use other less categorical verbs, such as 'recommend,' 'deserve,' 'justify' or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb 'require.'\"90\n\nVPBLEX-039, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Said article does not use other less categorical verbs, such as 'recommend,' 'deserve,' 'justify' or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb 'require.'\")\n\n79.\n\nThe Applicant's case is that there is a principle that flows from ICSID case law that there must be \"exceptional circumstances\" to lift a stay of enforcement. According to the Applicant, the relevant question therefore is not whether there are circumstances that require continuation of the stay, but rather whether there are circumstances that require the lifting of the stay.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee is unable to agree with the Applicant's position, which is incompatible with the language of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, as set out above. It is for the party requesting continuation of the stay to establish that there are circumstances that require such continuation; it is not for the counterparty to show that there are \"exceptional circumstances\" that require the lifting of the stay.91 The fact that under Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, if an application for annulment contains a request for stay of enforcement of the award, enforcement is provisionally stayed pending the decision of an *ad hoc* committee on whether or not the stay should be continued, does not create a presumption in favor of continuation. Nor does the fact that according to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \"either party\" (*i.e.,* either the applicant or the respondent) may request an *ad hoc* committee to rule on whether or not a provisional stay should be continued, create any presumption in favor of continuation of the stay; it merely means that it is for the requesting party - whether the applicant or the respondent - to establish that the stay should be continued, or that it should be terminated, as the case may be.\n\n*See, e.g.,* VPBLEX-037, *Ioannis Kardassapoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB0/07/15, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated 12 November 2010 (\"*Kardassapoulos*\"), para. 26 (\"Stay of enforcement during the annulment proceeding is by no way automatic, quite to the contrary, a stay is contingent upon the existence of relevant circumstances which must be proven by the Applicant.\")\n\n81.\n\nMoreover, while there are decisions of ICSID *ad hoc* committees that contain language that appears to support the Applicant's argument of a presumptive stay, on a careful reading those decisions have also turned on the issue of whether the requesting party has established that there are circumstances that require continuation of the stay. Thus, in *Azurix* (the case primarily relied upon by the Applicant), the *ad hoc* committee \"confirm[ed] its determination that, for the reasons submitted by Argentina, the circumstances require a stay of enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the annulment application.\"92 The Committee notes that the Applicant's counsel accepted at the Hearing that it is indeed for the Applicant to establish the relevant circumstances, and that the Applicant has also submitted argument to this effect in its written and oral submissions.93\n\n*Azurix*, para. 21.\n\nTr. Day 1, Applicant's Opening Statement, 73:1-24 (\"[MR. KIMBROUGH:] So it's clear there's nothing automatic. And I think I have used the words later that it's not automatic for us; I don't think it's automatic for them. But the phrase technically is worded in such a way that you may, if the circumstances require, stay. So that means that clearly we have to establish circumstances that require. We believe we've done that...So the reasons there are the direct elements that we bring forward as the reasons that this Committee should continue the stay. So we accept that if these reasons were made up or not serious, that you would not grant the stay.\")\n\n82.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the continuation of the stay is required for a number of reasons, including *inter alia* because the Annulment Application presents a *prima facie* case for annulment; because the right to institute annulment proceedings \"constitutes a fundamental right under the ICSID Convention;\" because the seizing of its assets by the Respondents would cause \"irreparable injury\" to the Applicant, even if they were eventually returned; and because termination of the stay would lead to \"catastrophic immediate and irreversible consequences for Zimbabwe's ability to conduct its affairs during the course of the proceedings,\" due to its \"strained foreign exchange resources,\" and would also deprive it of its ability to pay the costs related to these proceedings.94\n\nApplicant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 42-43.\n\n83.\n\nHaving carefully considered the record before it, the Committee is not satisfied that the Applicant has proven that the circumstances require the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. While the Applicant argues that the lifting of the stay would cause irreparable injury to it, it has not explained how this concern is specific to the lifting of the stay, as opposed to compliance with the Award in the event the Award is not annulled. Indeed, the Applicant has confirmed its intention to pay the Award if the Annulment Application is rejected, which implies that the payment of the Award would not have consequences that would have \"catastrophic immediate and irreversible consequences for [Zimbabwe's] ability to conduct its affairs.\"95\n\nVPBLEX-020, *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Guinea*, ICSID Case No, ARB/84/4, Interim Order No. 1 on Guinea's Application for Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated 12 August 1988 (\"*MINE*\"), para. 27.\n\n84.\n\nNor is there any evidence before the Committee that the lifting of the stay, in itself, would cause irreparable damage to the Applicant. More specifically, there is no evidence that would show that \"the termination of the stay would necessarily result in the deductions from the specific budgetary items involving the 'people's needs' that the Applicant cites as the basis for its claimed irreparable harm, as opposed to deductions, if any, from other budgetary items.\"96 While the Committee accepts that, on a general level, Zimbabwe's strained public finances are a matter of public knowledge, this in itself is not a sufficient reason to support, let alone establish, a request for continuation of a stay. As noted by the *ad hoc* committee in *MINE*, and confirmed by other *ad hoc* committees,\n\n\"[p]overty as such is not a circumstance justifying a stay any more than it would justify non-payment of an award. The criterion is, rather, whether termination of the stay would have what Guinea calls 'catastrophic' immediate and irreversible consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs.\"97\n\n*OI European Group B.V*., para. 119.\n\n*MINE*, para. 27. *See also Kardassapoulos*, para. 44; VPBLEX-024, *CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Whether or Not to Continue Stay and Order dated 14 July 2004, para. 21.\n\n85.\n\nAt the hearing, the Applicant's counsel specified that the irreparable consequences that the Applicant was referring to are primarily \"those that frustrate the fundamental right to pursue annulment,\" *i*. *e*., the effect that parallel enforcement proceedings would have on \"the serenity of the judicial process we are in now, the annulment proceedings, by these extraneous factors.\"98 While the Applicant provided some examples of how ongoing enforcement proceedings could affect its participation in the present annulment proceedings, the Applicant has failed to explain how this would amount to irreparable damage; nor has it provided any evidence to demonstrate that it would be unable to finance the present annulment proceedings or its participation therein.\n\nTr. Day 1, Applicant's Opening Argument, 27:22-28:11. The Applicant also confirmed, in response to a question from the Committee, that there would be \"economic harm.\" Tr. Day 1, Mr Kimbrough, 77:8-78:12.\n\n86.\n\nNor is there any concrete evidence before the Committee that the lifting of the stay would jeopardize Zimbabwe's debt restructuring process, and in any event, in the Committee's view this would not be a sufficient reason to maintain the stay of enforcement of the Award. It also seems unlikely that the debt restructuring process, which appears to be at a relatively early stage of re-engagement with the IFIs, could be completed during the pendency of these annulment proceedings, so as to have any effect on Zimbabwe's ability to pay the Award.\n\n87.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Applicant having failed to establish that the circumstances of the case require the stay of enforcement of the Award, there is no need for the Committee to consider whether a security should be ordered as a condition for continuation of the stay. Nor is there any need in the circumstances to consider the Respondents' argument that the Annulment Application is dilatory and that, therefore, the Applicant's request for continuation of the stay should be dismissed on this basis alone.\n\n88.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion that the circumstances of the case do not require the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Committee will turn to the question of the implications of its decision. In this connection, the Committee recalls that the Award provides for the restitution of the properties specified in paragraph 1020.1 of the Award and in the Tables referred to therein (the \"**Claimed Properties**\") within 90 days of the dispatch of the Award (the \"**Restitution Window**\") and, in addition, for payment of compensation in the amount specified in paragraph 1020.2 of the Award or, in the alternative, if restitution is not made in full within the Restitution Window of 90 days, for compensation in the higher amount specified in paragraph 1020.3 of the Award.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the 90-day period has already expired and that therefore upon termination of the stay, restitution is no longer available. According to the Respondents, the date on which the stay of enforcement took effect is the date of registration of the Annulment Application, *i.e*. 2 November 2015, which is more than 90 days after the dispatch of the Award, 28 July 2015.99 The Respondents rely in support of their position on the *Kardassopoulos* decision, which in the Respondents' submission confirmed that the relevant date in this connection is the date of registration.100 The Applicant argues, by contrast, that the date on which the stay of enforcement took effect is not the date of registration, but the date on which the complete Annulment Application was received by the ICSID Secretariat; and as this date was 23 October 2015,101 it was before 26 October 2015, *i.e.* the date on which the 90-day period expired.102\n\nTr. Day 1, Respondents' Opening Statement, 131:11, 132:16.\n\nTr. Day 1, Respondents' Opening Statement, 220:23, 221:18.\n\nThe Applicant submitted its Annulment Application on 21 October 2015, followed by the transmission of the supporting documents on 22 and 23 October 2015. ICSID acknowledged receipt of the complete copy of the Annulment Application on 23 October 2015.\n\nTr. Day 1, Applicant's Opening Statement, 18:20, 19:16.\n\n90.\n\nThus the question arises whether the termination of the provisional stay of enforcement results in the resumption of the Applicant's obligation to restitute the Claimed Properties, together with the obligation to pay the related (lower) amount of compensation, or whether the Restitution Window has already closed and, accordingly, whether the obligation to compensate in the higher amount specified in paragraph 1020.3 of the Award would become applicable.\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee notes, at the outset, that it is unable to agree with the Respondents' argument that the *Kardassopoulos* decision provides authority to determine that the date on which the stay of enforcement took effect is the date of registration of an annulment application. The passage of the decision on which the Respondents rely, and which appears to imply that, in that case, the provisional stay took effect on the date of registration of the annulment application, is contained in the part of the decision dealing with the procedural history of the annulment proceedings, and it is apparent from the context that it does not contain any findings of the *ad hoc* committee.103\n\n*See Kardassapoulos*, para. 3.\n\n92.\n\nIn examining this issue, the Committee notes that, while Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 50 define the requirements for registration of an annulment application, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules specifically address the issue as to when the provisional stay of enforcement takes effect. As noted above, Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention merely provides that, \"[i]f the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\" Similarly, ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) merely provides that the Secretary-General shall inform both parties of the provisional stay of enforcement together with the notice of registration of the annulment application, but again does not address the issue of the date of effect. The Explanatory Notes that were published with the ICSID Regulations and Rules of 1968 confirm that, in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, \"the Secretary-General [\u2026] has no discretion as to the granting or the refusal of the stay of enforcement of an award.\"104 The Explanatory Notes further clarify that if the Secretary-General \"refuses to register an application for lack of timeliness [\u2026] then no stay of enforcement can be based on that application.\"105\n\nSee Note C to Arbitration Rule 54 of the annotated notes to the ICSID Regulations and Rules, 1968, Doc. ICSID/4/Rev. 1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n93.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Committee considers that, if the Secretary-General refuses to register an annulment application because it does not meet the relevant requirements of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, enforcement of the award is not provisionally stayed, even if the annulment application contains a request for a provisional stay of enforcement. In other words, a provisional stay of enforcement is always subject to the registration of the annulment application which contains it. However, it does not necessarily follow that, if an annulment application meets the relevant requirements and is registered, a provisional stay of enforcement must be considered to have taken effect from the date of registration; this would imply that the lapse of time between the date of filing and the date of registration of an annulment application would fall exclusively on the applicant's account, even if the applicant has no control over the registration process.\n\n94.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Committee concludes that a provisional stay of enforcement must be considered to take effect from the date of filing with the ICSID Secretariat of an annulment application, subject to its subsequent registration by the ICSID Secretariat. If the ICSID Secretariat finds that an annulment application complies with the relevant requirements under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and registers it, any request for a provisional stay of enforcement of an award contained with it must be considered to have taken effect from the date of receipt by the ICSID Secretariat of the annulment application or, if the initial filing was not complete, from the date of receipt by the ICSID Secretariat of the complete annulment application. In the present case, this date is 23 October 2015, which is the date when the ICSID Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the remaining documents supporting the Applicant's Annulment Application, which the Secretariat had received two days earlier, on 21 October 2015.\n\n95.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that the Restitution Window cannot be considered as having closed, and that the provisional stay of enforcement took effect within the 90-day period envisioned in the Award.\n\n96.\n\nHaving concluded that the lifting of the stay will also apply to the Applicant's obligation to restore the Claimed Properties in accordance with paragraph 1020.1 of the Award, the Committee must determine the date on which the Restitution Window will close. The Committee has carefully considered the issue, including in view of its findings regarding the non-recoupment risk as set out below, and finds that the entire 90-day Restitution Window must be considered as being reinstated as a result of the lifting of the stay of enforcement and that, accordingly, the 90-day period within which the Applicant is to comply with its restitution obligation should start running from the date of dispatch of this Decision to the Parties. The Committee notes that a contrary conclusion would effectively penalize the Applicant for the exercise of its right to seek annulment of the Award, which would not be in accordance with the letter and spirit of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.106 In reaching this conclusion, the Committee is mindful of the unusual circumstances of this case, which involves not only an obligation to reinstate the Claimed Properties, but also an alternative obligation relating to the amount of compensation awarded.\n\nIt would be unreasonable to count the time spent by an applicant preparing its annulment application against the applicant when that time was well within the window provided under Article 52(2), as this would effectively result in imposing an obligation on an applicant to enforce an award while preparing a challenge of the award and a request for provisional stay.\n\n97.\n\nAs to the risk of non-recoupment of the collected amounts in the event the Award is annulled, while the Parties do not agree that there is such a risk, the Respondents suggest that any risk of non-recoupment can be eliminated by way of an appropriate escrow arrangement. Accordingly, the Respondents have indicated in their written submissions and again confirmed at the Hearing that they would be willing to place any funds paid under the Award in an escrow account pending the outcome of these annulment proceedings. The Respondents note that \"[p]revious *ad hoc* committees have regarded such arrangements as sufficient to 'effectively eliminate[]' any risk of possible non-recoupment.\"107\n\nRespondents' Skeleton Arguments on Stay, para. 61 (citing VPBLEX-031, *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated 5 March 2009, para. 83).\n\n98.\n\nThe Committee agrees that, in the circumstances of this case, an escrow arrangement would appropriately balance the Parties' legitimate interests pending the completion of these annulment proceedings. Accordingly, the Committee directs the Parties to engage in discussions with a view to agreeing on an appropriate escrow arrangement. The Committee will provide the necessary procedural directions in due course by separate procedural order.\n\n**IV.

B****ackground**\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Republic of Zimbabwe (the \"**Applicant**\") filed applications for annulment (the \"**Annulment Applications**\") and requests for stay of enforcement in respect of the awards in the conjoined cases *Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15) and *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25) (the \"**von Pezold Award**\" and the \"**Border Timbers Award**,\" respectively, and together the \"**Awards**\") pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committees (the \"**Committees**\") in these matters were constituted on 21 December 2015. The Committees conducted a joint first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 11 February 2016, setting out the procedural framework and the timetable for the present annulment proceedings. Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n\"The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part ('Part I') shall deal with the Applicant's request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings. The second part ('Part II') shall deal with the Applicant's applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.\"\n\n3.\n\nFollowing the Parties' submissions in Part I of the proceedings, the hearing on stay held on 14 and 15 December 2016 and the filing by the Parties of their post-hearing memorials, on 24 April 2017, the Committees issued their Decisions on Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Decisions on Stay**\"). In their Decisions on Stay the Committees decided that:\n\n\"(1) The Applicant's request for the continued stay of the enforcement of the Award rendered on 28 July 2015 is rejected;\n\n(2) The provisional stay is lifted as of the date of this Decision;\n\n(3) The Applicant has 90 days as of the date of dispatch of this Decision to comply with paragraph 1020.1 of the Award;\n\n(4) Any funds paid by the Applicant or collected by the Respondents in consequence of the Award, and any documents establishing title to the Claimed Properties, be placed in escrow until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings;\n\n(5) The Parties are directed to engage in discussions with a view to agreeing on an appropriate escrow arrangement; and\n\n(6) The decision on the allocation of costs is reserved until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings.\"1\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 24 April 2017, para. 99. In *Border Timbers Limited and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/25), the Committees similarly decided, in paragraph 99 of the Decision on Stay:  \n(1) The Applicant's request for the continued stay of the enforcement of the Award rendered on 28 July 2015 is rejected;  \n(2) The provisional stay is lifted as of the date of this Decision;  \n(3) The Applicant has 90 days as of the date of dispatch of this Decision to comply with paragraph 1012.1 of the Award;  \n(4) Any funds paid by the Applicant or collected by the Respondents in consequence of the Award, and any documents establishing title to the Claimed Properties, be placed in escrow until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings;  \n(5) The Parties are directed to engage in discussions with a view to agreeing on an appropriate escrow arrangement; and  \n(6) The decision on the allocation of costs is reserved until the conclusion of these annulment proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 May 2017, the Committees issued Procedural Order No. 2, providing the Parties with procedural directions regarding the escrow arrangement and requesting the Parties to revert by 15 June 2017 \"advising the Committees of the agreement reached and, to the extent there are any issues on which the Parties have been unable to agree, of their respective positions on any such issues.\"\n\n5.\n\nFollowing a joint request from the Parties on 14 June 2017, the Committees granted an extension until 23 June 2017 for the Parties to report on their agreement and/or positions on the escrow arrangement. On 23 June 2017, after a further joint request from the Parties, the deadline was again extended until 29 June 2017.\n\n6.\n\nOn 29 June 2017, the Respondents filed a report on the progress and outstanding issues concerning the escrow arrangement together with exhibits VPB-51 through VPB-58. On the same date, the Applicant sent its own report together with a draft v11 of the escrow agreement. On 30 June 2017, the Respondents sent a letter following up on the previous day's correspondence together with exhibits VPB-59 through VPB-62, which the Applicant responded to in its correspondence dated 3 July 2017.\n\n7.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions, on 7 July 2017, the Committees provided the Parties with directions as to who the escrow agent under the escrow agreement should be, as well as directions for the release of funds and/or documents held in escrow, and invited the Parties to revert again by 14 July 2017.\n\n8.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, the Respondents wrote to update the Committees on the status of the discussion between the Parties and requested an extension until 19 July 2017 for the Parties to revert to the Committees. The Committees granted the extension on the same day.\n\n9.\n\nOn 19 July 2017, both Parties informed the Committees separately that they had not been able to reach an agreement regarding the escrow arrangement, each Party attaching a draft escrow arrangement. The Applicant submitted additional exhibits ZA-228 through ZA-234 in support of its position. The Applicant also requested that the Committees extend the deadlines (the \"**Restitution Window**\") to comply with paragraph 1012.1 of the Border Timbers Award and paragraph 1020.1 of the von Pezold Award. Upon invitation from the Committees, the Respondents submitted additional comments on the Applicant's letter on 20 and 21 July 2017. The Applicant responded to the Respondents' additional comments on 21 July 2017.\n\n10.\n\nOn 23 July 2017, the Committees wrote to the Parties noting \"that they do not have jurisdiction to grant the Applicant's request as this would require the Committees to vary the Awards. While the Committees do have jurisdiction to stay the enforcement of the Awards, this matter was already decided in the Committees' Decisions on Stay of Enforcement dated 24 April 2017.\" The Committees extended the deadline fixed by the Committees in ICSID's letter of 7 July 2017 for the Parties to engage in further discussions with a view to reaching an agreement on the terms of the escrow arrangement, until 7 July 2017. The Committees noted that if the Parties were unable to reach an agreement by that date, they would make a final decision on the escrow arrangement.\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 July 2017, the Applicant filed an Urgent Application for Provisional Measures including Temporary Stay of Execution pursuant to pursuant to Articles 50(2) and 52(5), of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules 39 and 54 (the \"**Application**\"). The Applicant enclosed with its Application a confirmation of its election of restitution in accordance with paragraph 1012.1 of the Border Timbers Award and paragraph 1020.1 of the von Pezold Award, in the form of a \"General Notice\" signed by Hon. P.A. Chinamasa, the Acting Minister of Lands and Rural Settlement, which was to be published and take effect 120 days after the issuance of the Committees of their decision on annulment (the \"**General Notice**\"). In its Application, the Applicant requested the Committees to confirm that:\n\n\"i) Zimbabwe elected to restitute the Properties before 23 July 2017;\n\nii) the Escrow Agreement per Directions of the Committees of 7 July 2017 is to be opened with the B\u00e2tonnier of the Paris Bar serving as Escrow Agent;\n\niii) no Agreement has been signed to date as issues raised by the Paris Bar remain unanswered;\n\niv) the B\u00e2tonnier has not informed the Parties of the bank account references into which to deposit Escrow Funds;\n\nv) Zimbabwe is legally and practically prevented from implementing Restitution with the B\u00e2tonnier Escrow Agent for those reasons (i.e., no Agreement has been signed to date \u2013 no account number).\"2\n\nApplication, para. 12.\n\n12.\n\nThe Applicant further requested the Committees \"to grant a stay of Execution of the Awards from 23 July 2017 through the date five Paris Business Days following opening of B\u00e2tonnier Escrow Account and to order VPB to maintain confidentiality of Zimbabwe's elect[ion] to restitute the Properties until the release of these Title documents from Escrow upon Final Decision on the Merits of the Annulment Applications.\"3\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n13.\n\nThe Applicant argued that the measures requested were reasonable and proportionate and required under the circumstances, in particular because the Respondents had not acted sufficiently promptly to finalize the discussions on the escrow agreement before the 90-day deadline provided for in the Awards.4\n\nApplication, paras. 15 and 16.\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 July 2017, the Committees invited the Respondents to provide their comments on the Application by 28 July 2017.\n\n15.\n\nOn 28 July 2017, the Applicant submitted comments on the Respondents' draft v15 of the escrow agreement, together with a new draft v16.\n\n16.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondents submitted their response to the Application (the \"**Response**\") together with exhibit VPB-63. The Respondents opposed the Application and requested that the Committees dismiss the Application on the following grounds:\n\n\"9.1.1 Zimbabwe has not sought to establish that it has met the tests it has set itself \u2013 there is simply no legal analysis whatsoever to support the Application;\n\n9.1.2 Further or alternatively, Zimbabwe seeks to reopen the 23 July Decision (which the Committees cannot do);\n\n9.1.3 Further or alternatively, Zimbabwe has not met the test for the grant of provisional measures; and\n\n9.1.4 Further or alternatively, Zimbabwe has not established sufficiently compelling (or any) circumstances to justify a stay.\"5\n\nResponse, paras. 9.1.1 \u2013 9.1.4.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondents further contended that the \"General Notice does not purport to restitute the Zimbabwean Properties as required by the terms of the Awards.\"6\n\nResponse, para. 1.2.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondents separately commented on the Applicant's comments of the same date on the escrow arrangement and reserved their right \"to advise the Committees by 7 August 2017 on their positions as to those issues on which the parties cannot agree, as per the Committees' direction of 23 July 2017.\"\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 August 2017, the Respondents submitted their update on the status of the Parties' discussions and the outstanding issues concerning the escrow arrangement together with draft v15 of the escrow agreement and exhibits VPB-64 through VPB-66. On the same day, the Applicant submitted its update on the status of the discussions on the escrow arrangement. The Applicant also commented on the Respondents' further argument on the Application.\n\n20.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, the Respondents informed the Committees of certain changes that in their view had to be introduced to drafts v15 and v16 of the escrow agreement, in order for the drafts to comply with French legal requirements.\n\n**II.

The Application**\n----------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn their Decisions on the Applicant's Applications for Provisional Measures dated 17 March and 13 October 2016, the Committees observed that the Applicant's applications \"raised an issue that has also arisen before other *ad hoc* committees, but which has not yet been decided, as to whether an ICSID *ad hoc* committee is competent to recommend provisional measures in the first place.\"7 The Committees further noted that, while the Parties agreed that the Committees \"would have, at the very least, an inherent power to recommend provisional measures necessary to protect the integrity of the present proceedings,\" in view of the conclusions reached in their Decisions, the Committees did not consider it necessary to rule on the issue.\n\nDecision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2016, para. 30; Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures, 13 October 2016, para. 36.\n\n22.\n\nThe Committees have considered the Parties' submissions on the Application and, for the reasons set out below, have concluded that it is not necessary to rule on this issue in this Decision either.\n\n23.\n\nThe Applicant has termed its submission as an application for provisional measures, but what it seeks is, in substance, a temporary stay of enforcement of the Awards, together with a confirmation by the Committees of a number of statements set out in paragraph 12 of the Application. The Committees note at the outset that the legal requirements for the two types of relief \u2013 provisional measures and temporary stay \u2013 are not the same. While Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that an *ad hoc* committee *may* stay enforcement of an ICSID award provisionally, pending its decision on the annulment application, \"if it considers that the circumstances so require,\" ICSID tribunals typically require, and the Parties in their previous submissions in these cases have argued, that an application for provisional measures must meet the requirements of urgency, necessity and risk of irreparable harm.8\n\n*See* Response, para. 6.1; Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2016, paras. 12 to 14 and 22 (summarizing the Parties' arguments on the requirements for provisional measures); Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures, 13 October 2016, paras. 16 to 19 and 27 (summarizing the Parties' arguments on the requirements for provisional measures).\n\n24.\n\nThe Committees note that the Applicant has not argued in its Application what the applicable requirements, in its view, are and has not sought to demonstrate that the Application meets those requirements. However, the Applicant does argue that \"[t]he circumstances require\" the measures it requests, particularly because, in the Applicant's submission, the Respondents have not acted sufficiently promptly to finalize the discussions on the escrow arrangement*.*9 However, the Applicant does not appear to suggest that the alleged delay alone is a sufficient basis to grant its application, and in any event, there is no evidence before the Committees to show that either Party has sought to delay the discussions on the escrow arrangement.\n\nApplication, para. 16.\n\n25.\n\nIn the circumstances, as the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that its Application meets either the requirements for provisional measures or the requirements for a temporary stay of enforcement of the Awards, in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 39 and 54, the Committees dismiss the Applicant's Application.\n\n26.\n\nTo the extent that the Applicant seeks to reinstate its request of 21 July 2017 for an extension of time of the 90-day period to comply with paragraph 1012.1 of the Border Timbers Award and paragraph 1020.1 of the von Pezold Award (see paragraphs 10, 11, 14 and 18 of the Application), the Committees note that the Applicant's request for such an extension was denied by the Committees' ruling of 23 July 2017, on the basis that granting such a request would amount to varying the Awards, which is beyond the Committees' jurisdiction. The Applicant argues in its Application that the Committees, in their Decisions on Stay, \"did modify the Awards a first time as it added time to the Restitution Window fixed in the Awards,\" and that \"the Committees have the same jurisdiction to do so again.\"10 However, when determining in the Decisions on Stay that the 90-day Restitution Window within which the Applicant was to comply with its restitution obligation should start running from the date of dispatch of the Decisions on Stay, the Committees did not \"add time\" to, or extend, the Restitution Window, as fixed in the Awards; the Committees merely reinstated it, in order not to \"penalize the Applicant for the exercise of its right to seek annulment of the Award[s].\"11 Now that the Restitution Window, as reinstated by the Committees, has closed, the Committees have no power to extend it.\n\nApplication, para. 18.\n\nDecisions on Stay, para. 96.\n\n27.\n\nThe Committees note that the Applicant remains free to deposit the relevant property documents in escrow, even if the Restitution Window has closed, in furtherance of an amicable settlement of the dispute between the Parties.\n\n**B. Escrow Arrangement**\n-------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Committees note that, as set out in the Parties' correspondence of 7 August 2017, despite further directions provided by the Committees on 7 July 2017 and several extensions of time, the Parties have been unable to agree on the escrow arrangement, and that there are still numerous points, which do not appear to be minor, on which the Parties continue to disagree.\n\n29.\n\nIn the circumstances, and considering that, even if the Committees were now to provide further directions to the Parties on the outstanding points, there is no guarantee that no further issues will arise in the course of the further discussions that prevent the Parties from reaching an agreement, the Committees direct each of the Parties to individually establish escrow accounts of their own devise. The Parties are directed to submit their proposed escrow account arrangements for the Committees' prior review and approval by 15 September 2017. This arrangement will allow the Applicant to deposit the funds payable under the Awards (and the relevant property documents should it so wish), and the Respondents to deposit any funds they may be able to collect on the Awards, in escrow**.** The escrow accounts must be established with an internationally reputable bank.\n\n**III. D****ecision**\n---------------------\n\n30.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committees decide as follows:\n\n(a) The Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures including Temporary Stay of Execution is dismissed;\n\n(b) The Parties are directed to individually establish escrow accounts of their own devise, with an internationally reputable bank, in accordance with paragraph 99(4) of the Decisions on Stay; and\n\n(c) The Parties are directed to submit their proposed escrow account arrangements for the Committees' prior review and approval **by 15 September 2017**."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2018-11-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF SELECTED ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINED TERMS** |\n| Applications | Applications for Annulment of the Republic of Zimbabwe |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings in force as of 10 April 2006 |\n| Award or the von Pezold Award | Award of the Tribunal rendered on 28 July 2015 in the arbitration proceeding *Bernhard von Pezold and others v Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No ARB/10/15) |\n| Awards | Awards of the Tribunals rendered on 28 July 2015 in the arbitration proceedings between Bernhard von Pezold and others and the Republic of Zimbabwe and Border Timbers Limited, Timber Products International (Private) Limited and Hangani Development Co.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns the application for annulment (the \"**Application**\") of the award rendered on 28 July 2015 in the arbitration proceeding between Bernhard von Pezold and others and the Republic of Zimbabwe (ICSID Case No ARB/10/15) (the \"**von Pezold Award**\" or the \"**Award**\") rendered by an arbitral tribunal composed of the Honourable L. Yves Fortier, Mr Michael Hwang, and Prof David A.R. Williams (the \"**Tribunal**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe applicant on annulment is the Republic of Zimbabwe (\"**Zimbabwe**\" or the \"**Applicant**\"). The respondents on annulment are Bernhard Friedrich Arnd R\u00fcdiger von Pezold, Elisabeth Regina Maria Gabriele von Pezold, Anna Eleonore Elisabeth Webber (n\u00e9e von Pezold), Heinrich Bernd Alexander Josef von Pezold, Maria Juliane Andrea Christiane Katharina Batthy\u00e1ny (n\u00e9e von Pezold), Georg Philipp Marcel Johann Lukas von Pezold, Felix Alard Moritz Hermann Kilian von Pezold, Johann Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Pezold, Adam Friedrich Carl Leopold Franz Severin von Pezold (the \"**VPBs**\" or the \"**Respondents**,\"1 and together with the Applicant, the \"**Parties**\").\n\nThe terms \"VPBs\" and \"Respondents\" also include the Border Claimants.\n\n3.\n\nThe Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n4.\n\nZimbabwe filed simultaneously an application for annulment of the award rendered on 28 July 2015 in the arbitration proceeding between Border Timbers Limited, Timber Products International (Private) Limited, and Hangani Development Co. (Private) Limited (the \"**Border Claimants**\") and the Republic of Zimbabwe (ICSID Case No ARB/10/25) by the same Tribunal (the \"**Border Timbers Award**,\" and together with the von Pezold Award, the \"**Awards**\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 29 September 1995 (the \"**Germany-Zimbabwe BIT**\"), the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Zimbabwe on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 15 August 1996 (the \"**Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n6.\n\nThe dispute in the original proceeding related to the alleged expropriation by Zimbabwe of land and other property held by the VPBs.\n\n7.\n\nIn the Awards, the Tribunals unanimously found Zimbabwe in breach of the applicable BITs and ordered it to make restitution to the VPBs as well as pay compensation. The Awards further stipulated that if restitution was not perfected within 90 days, Zimbabwe would be obligated to pay additional compensation.\n\n8.\n\nZimbabwe applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) the Tribunals were not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)); and (iii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)).\n\n9.\n\nIn its Amended and Restated Application for Annulment, which was filed on 7 June 2017, together with the Applicant's Memorial on Annulment, the Applicant added a further ground for annulment, namely that the Award had failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n10.\n\nIn the original proceeding, the Parties agreed that the two cases would be heard together, although they would not be formally consolidated, and that the two Tribunals would render two separate awards. In Procedural Order No 1 of the annulment proceeding, the Committees decided that the two cases would continue to be heard together, and that the Committees shall issue separate decisions in relation to each Award. The present decision deals with the von Pezold Award.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. THE REQUEST FOR STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, Zimbabwe filed the Application with the Secretary-General of ICSID. Zimbabwe's Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\") for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Zimbabwe's Application was decided (the \"**Request for Stay**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 2 November 2015, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 21 December 2015, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Dr Veijo Heiskanen, a national of Finland and designated as President of the Committee, Ms Jean Kalicki, a national of the United States of America, and Professor Azzedine Kettani, a national of Morocco, had been constituted (the \"**Committee**\"). On the same date, the Parties were notified that Ms Jara M\u00ednguez Almeida, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 by teleconference. In addition to the Committee and the Secretary, participating in the teleconference were:\n\n*For the Applicant* :\n\nMr Philip Kimbrough Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nMr Tristan Moreau Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nThe Honourable Prince Machaya Attorney General of the Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Fortune Chimbaru Acting Director Civil Division, Attorney General's\n\nOffice, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Elizabeth Sumowah Legal Advisor, Ministry of Lands and Rural\n\nResettlement, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\n*For the Respondents* :\n\nMr Matthew Coleman Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMs Helen Aldridge Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMr Thomas Innes Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMr Charles O. Verrill, Jr Attorney at Law\n\n15.\n\nOn 11 February 2016, the Committee issued Procedural Order No 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the Committee's decisions on those procedural matters where the Parties did not agree. Procedural Order No 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France.\n\n16.\n\nProcedural Order No 1 also sets forth the procedural calendar. In particular, Section 15.l of Procedural Order No 1 provides:\n\n*The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part (\"Part I\") shall deal with the Applicant's request that the enforcement of the Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings.*\n\n*The second part (\"Part II\") shall deal with the Applicant's applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Committees.*\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting the order of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"**Application for Provisional Measures**\"). Apart from a request for provisional measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the *status quo* pending the Parties' filing of further observations on the matter.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee's decision to deny the Applicant's request for an interim order and inviting the Respondents to submit their response to the Application on Provisional Measures by 2 March 2016. The Respondents submitted their response on that date.\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the Committee issued a Decision on the Applicant's Application for Provisional Measures (the \"**Decision on Provisional Measures**\"). The Committee dismissed the Application for Provisional Measures, while reminding the Parties of their general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the pendency of the annulment proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No 1, on 4 April 2016, the Applicant filed its Memorial in Support of Continuing the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Memorial on Stay**\"), together with Exhibits ZA-072 to ZA-113 and Legal Authorities ZALEX-061 to ZALEX-072.\n\n21.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, the Respondents filed their Counter-Memorial on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Counter-Memorial on Stay**\"), together with Exhibits VPB-010 to VPB-026 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-018 to VPBLEX-057.\n\n22.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, the Applicant filed its Reply on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Reply on Stay**\"). On 7 July 2016, the Applicant submitted an amended version of its Reply on Stay, together with Exhibits ZA-114 to ZA-151, including a witness statement of Dr J.P. Mangudya (Exhibit ZA-121), a witness statement of the Honourable Prince Machaya (Exhibit ZA-137) and a witness statement of Mr Zvinechimwe Churu (Exhibit ZA-144), and Legal Authorities ZALEX-073 to ZALEX-077.\n\n23.\n\nOn 31 July 2016, the Respondents filed their Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the \"**Rejoinder on Stay**\"), together with Exhibits VPB-027 to VPB-043, including a witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-032), and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-058 to VPBLEX-068.\n\n24.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I (the \"**Second Application for Provisional Measures**\").\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with an invitation from the Committee, on 23 September 2016, the Respondents filed a response to the Second Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n26.\n\nOn 13 October 2016, the Committee issued a Decision on the Second Application for Provisional Measures (the \"**Second Decision on Provisional Measures**\"), denying the Second Application.\n\n27.\n\nOn 16 November 2016, the Applicant requested leave from the Committee to file Exhibit ZA-152 with its Skeleton Arguments on Stay of Enforcement. On 18 November 2016, the Committee granted the Applicant's request and instructed the Respondents to file any observations they might have on that document within five business days of its production. Later that day, the Respondents filed their Skeleton Arguments on Stay and the Applicant filed its Skeleton Arguments on Stay, together with Exhibit ZA-152.\n\n28.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, the Respondents filed their observations on Exhibit ZA-152 in the form of Exhibits VPB-044 to VPB-047 and a further witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048).\n\n29.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 30 November 2016, the Committee granted the Applicant leave to file an additional witness statement in response to the Respondents' observations of 25 November 2016.\n\n30.\n\nOn 2 December 2016, the Applicant filed an additional witness statement of Dr J.P. Mangudya (Exhibit ZA-153). Together with the witness statement, the Applicant requested a procedural ruling from the Committee in advance of the scheduled hearing regarding alleged hearsay evidence contained in the additional witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048). On 4 December 2016, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's request.\n\n31.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the Respondents filed their comments on the Applicant's 2 December 2016 request for a procedural ruling from the Committee regarding the alleged hearsay evidence. The Respondents requested that Exhibit VPB-048 be kept on the record in its entirety or, should the Committee decide to exclude it, Exhibit ZA-152 be struck from the record as well.\n\n32.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Secretary of the Committee and the Parties by telephone conference. During the call, in addition to discussing logistical arrangements for the upcoming hearing on the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Parties agreed that there was no need for the Committee to strike portions of Exhibit VPB-048 from the record.\n\n33.\n\nA hearing on the stay of enforcement of the Awards was held in Paris, France, on 14 and 15 December 2016 (the \"**Hearing on Stay**\"). In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, the following individuals were present at the Hearing on Stay:\n\n*For the Applicant* :\n\nMr Philip Kimbrough Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nMr Tristan Moreau Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nThe Honourable Prince Machaya Attorney General of the Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Fortune Chimbaru Acting Director Civil Division, Attorney General's Office, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Elizabeth Sumowah Legal Advisor, Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Varaidzo Zifudzi Principal Director, Legal Services, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Chrispen Mavodza Director, Legal Affairs Department Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Zvinechimwe Ruvinga Churu Principal Director, Budgets and Acting Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\n*For the Respondents* :\n\nMr Matthew Coleman Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMs Helen Aldridge Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMr Thomas Innes Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMr Charles O. Verrill, Jr Attorney at Law\n\nMr Heinrich von Pezold\n\n*Court Reporter* :\n\nMr Trevor McGowan The Court Reporter Ltd\n\n34.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Stay, the following persons were examined:\n\n*On behalf of the Applicant* :\n\nThe Honourable Prince Machaya Attorney General, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Willard L. Manungo Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Econom\n\nDevelopment, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr John Panonetsa Mangudya Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe\n\n*On behalf of the Respondents* :\n\nMr Heinrich von Pezold\n\n35.\n\nAt the close of the Hearing on Stay, the Parties were instructed to agree on a further, limited document production procedure. Following exchanges between the Parties, on 19 January 2017, the Respondents sent directly to the Applicant a request that it produce certain documents and attached to their request Legal Authority VPBLEX-069. On 2 February 2017, the Respondents sent a further communication directly to the Applicant requesting additional updated information (this letter was subsequently introduced into the record as Exhibit VPB-050).\n\n36.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, the Applicant produced Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 in response to the Respondents' document production request of 19 January 2017. The Applicant stated that Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 should \"properly inform the Parties without breaching the Applicant's confidentiality obligations.\"\n\n37.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee stating that they did not consider the documents produced by the Applicant to satisfy their request for document production and asked the Committee to determine whether their request had been met. The Respondents also requested leave from the Committee to make observations and file new evidence in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155. On 14 February 2017, the Committee granted the Respondents' request to make observations and file new evidence.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 February 2017, the Respondents filed a witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-049) in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter of 26 February 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee's decision to deny the Respondents' request for document production, taking note of the Applicant's refusal to produce the documents on grounds of confidentiality. The Committee noted that its decision was without prejudice to the determination, which it would make in due course, as to whether the Applicant had established the facts that the requested documents allegedly support.\n\n40.\n\nThe Applicant filed its Post-Hearing Brief on Stay on 9 March 2017, and the Respondents filed their Post-Hearing Brief on Stay on 10 March 2017.\n\n41.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee requesting that certain allegations made in the Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief on Stay be disregarded. The Applicant commented on this request by letter dated 6 April 2017. By letter of 10 April 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the Parties that the Committee had decided not to formally disregard the Applicant's allegations, and that it would assess the Applicant's allegations in terms of their relevance to the Applicant's request for stay and the evidentiary record of this annulment proceeding.\n\n42.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, by letter of 3 April 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee confirming the procedural calendar for Phase II of the proceedings, pursuant to the timetable set forth in Procedural Order No 1.\n\n**B. THE ESCROW ARRANGEMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn 24 April 2017, the Committee issued its Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award (the \"**Decision on Stay**\").2 In its Decision, the Committee: (i) rejected the Applicant's request for the continued stay of the enforcement of the Awards; (ii) lifted the provisional stay of enforcement; (iii) noted that the Applicant had 90 days as of the dispatch of the Decision on Stay to comply with paragraph 1020.1 of the Award; and (iv) ordered that any funds paid by the Applicant or collected by the Respondents in consequence of the Award, and any documents establishing title to the properties specified in paragraph 1020.1 of the Award and in the Tables referred to therein (the \"**Claimed Properties**\"), be placed in escrow until the conclusion of the annulment proceedings (the \"**Escrow Arrangement**\").\n\nAnnex A to this Decision.\n\n44.\n\nOn 3 May 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No 2, inviting the Parties to advise the Committee, by 15 June 2017, of the agreement reached and, to the extent there were any issues on which the Parties were unable to agree, of their respective positions on the Escrow Arrangement provided for in the Decision on Stay.\n\n45.\n\nAs discussed further below, pursuant to the procedural calendar established in Procedural Order No 1 and as confirmed by the ICSID Secretariat's letter of 3 April 2017, on 7 June 2017, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment (the \"**Memorial**\"), together with Exhibits ZA-156 to ZA-227, including witness statements of Mr Chrispen Mavodza (Exhibit ZA-156), Ms Sophia Christina Tsvakwi (Exhibit ZA-157), Ms Virginia Sithole (Exhibit ZA-158), Mr Onias Claver Masiwa (Exhibit ZA-159), the Honourable Prince Machaya (Exhibit ZA-160) and Ms Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell (Exhibit ZA-161), and Legal Authorities ZALEX-085 to ZALEX-123.\n\n46.\n\nBy email of 14 June 2017, the Respondents, on behalf of the Parties, requested that the 15 June 2017 deadline for the Parties' comments on the Escrow Arrangement be extended until 23 June 2017. The Committee subsequently granted this extension.\n\n47.\n\nBy email of 23 June 2017, the Respondents, on behalf of the Parties, provided an update to the Committee on the progress made with respect to the Escrow Arrangement and requested until 29 June 2017 to provide a further update. The Committee subsequently granted the Parties' request.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter of 29 June 2017, the Respondents submitted a report on the progress and outstanding issues concerning the Escrow Arrangement, together with Exhibits VPB-051 to VPB-058. By email of the same date, the Applicant transmitted to the Committee a draft version of the Escrow Arrangement, together with a letter from Mr Philip Kimbrough, counsel for the Applicant, to Mr Matthew Coleman, counsel for the Respondents. In the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Parties requested that the Committee decide (i) who should be the escrow agent; and (ii) the mechanism for the release of the sums and/or documents held in escrow.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter of 30 June 2017, the Respondents submitted further comments on the Escrow Arrangement, together with Exhibits VPB-059 to VPB-062. The Applicant responded to these further comments by letter of 3 July 2017.\n\n50.\n\nBy letter of 7 July 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee with regard to the Escrow Arrangement and in response to the Parties' request of 29 June 2017. The Committee directed that (i) the Parties appoint the Escrow Service of the Office of the *B\u00e1tonnier* of the Paris Bar as the escrow agent; and that (ii) the Parties agree on comprehensive directions for release of funds and/or documents held in escrow that would cover various scenarios. The Committee requested that the Parties report back on their progress on these issues by 14 July 2017.\n\n51.\n\nBy email of 14 July 2017, the Respondents provided an update on the Escrow Arrangement further to the Committee's directions of 7 July 2017 and requested until 19 July 2017 to provide a further update. The Committee subsequently granted the request.\n\n52.\n\nBy email of 19 July 2017, the Respondents transmitted to the Committee a revised Escrow Arrangement including a redline of the edits made to the draft version previously sent by the Applicant on 29 June 2017.\n\n53.\n\nAlso by email of 19 July 2017, the Applicant transmitted to the Committee its observations on the Escrow Arrangement, together with Exhibits ZA-228 to ZA-234. The Applicant's observations also contained a request that the Committee suspend the 90-day restitution deadline as ordered in the Decision on Stay.\n\n54.\n\nOn 20 July 2017, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's request to suspend the restitution deadline. The Respondents provided their comments by a letter of the same date.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter of 23 July 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee with regard to the Applicant's 19 July 2017 request to suspend the restitution deadline. The Committee rejected the Applicant's request, citing a lack of jurisdiction over the request as this would require the Committee to vary the Awards. The Committee therefore directed the Parties to provide an update by 7 August 2017 of the agreement reached or, to the extent that there were any issues on which the Parties had been unable to agree, of their respective positions on the Escrow Arrangement. Finally, the Committee stated that, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties by the stated deadline, it did not envisage granting any further extensions and would make a final decision on the Escrow Arrangement.\n\n56.\n\nOn 25 July 2017, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures requesting that the Committees order a temporary stay from 23 July 2017 to five business days following the opening of the *B\u00e1tonnier* Escrow Account (the \"**Third Application for Provisional Measures**\"). The Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's request by 28 July 2018.\n\n57.\n\nOn 28 July 2017, the Respondents submitted their comments on the Third Application for Provisional Measures, together with Exhibit VPB-063.\n\n58.\n\nBy letters of 7 August 2017, pursuant to the Committee's direction of 23 July 2017, each Party submitted a status report of the discussions on the Escrow Arrangement. With their letter, the Respondents included Exhibits VPB-064 to VPB-066.\n\n59.\n\nOn 22 August 2017, the Committee issued a Decision on the Third Application for Provisional Measures (the \"**Third Decision on Provisional Measures**\"). In the Decision, the Committee (i) dismissed the Third Application; (ii) directed the Parties to individually establish escrow accounts of their own devise, with an internationally reputable bank; and (iii) directed the Parties to submit their proposed Escrow Arrangements for the Committee's prior review and approval by 15 September 2017.\n\n60.\n\nOn 15 September 2017, pursuant to the Third Decision on Provisional Measures, each Party submitted to the Committee its proposed Escrow Arrangement; with their proposal, the Respondents included Exhibit VPB-067. By email of later that date, the Respondents objected to the wording of the Applicant's proposal and suggested alternative language. The Committee subsequently invited the Applicant to comment on the Respondents' objection and suggestion by 19 September 2017.\n\n61.\n\nOn 19 September 2017, the Applicant confirmed its agreement with the Respondents' suggested language proposed on 15 September 2017; the Applicant also proposed additional language in light of Exhibit VPB-067. The Committee subsequently invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's proposal by 21 September 2017.\n\n62.\n\nOn 21 September 2017, the Respondents confirmed their agreement with the Applicant's proposed additional language of 19 September 2017.\n\n63.\n\nOn 25 September 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No 3, ordering the Parties to conclude individual Escrow Arrangements with the *B\u00e1tonnier* of the Paris Bar as the escrow agent, directing that each Party deposit with the *B\u00e1tonnier* of the Paris Bar the sums payable under the Award, until the conclusion of this annulment proceeding, and inviting the Parties to inform the Committee promptly of any sums deposited to the individual escrow accounts.\n\n64.\n\nThe Committee notes that neither Party has informed the Committee of any sums deposited on either escrow account during this annulment proceeding. Consequently, and in accordance with the terms of Procedural Order No 3, the Committee's directions in Procedural Order No 3 will lapse upon the issuance of the present Decision, as directed by the Committee in the operative part of this Decision.\n\n**C. THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT**\n------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 45, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment on 7 June 2017.\n\n66.\n\nBy email of 5 October 2017, the day before the deadline envisioned in the procedural calendar for the Respondents' Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the \"**CounterMemorial**\"), the Respondents transmitted a letter addressed directly to the Applicant regarding an alleged breach by the Applicant of the *status quo*. The letter did not request any action from the Committee.\n\n67.\n\nOn 8 October 2017, two days later than the deadline envisioned in the procedural calendar, the Respondents filed their Counter-Memorial, together with Exhibits VPB-068 to VPB-282 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-070 to VPBLEX-100. The Committee subsequently invited the Applicant to comment on the Respondents' late submission by 10 October 2017.\n\n68.\n\nOn 10 October 2017, the Applicant submitted its comments on the Respondents' late submission of their Counter-Memorial. The Applicant did not object to the admission of the Counter-Memorial into the record, however it requested that the Committee extend the deadlines for the remaining pleadings on annulment. The Committee subsequently invited the Respondents to submit their response to the Applicant's request by 13 October 2017.\n\n69.\n\nOn 13 October 2017, the Respondents provided their response to the Applicant's request of 10 October 2017.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter of 16 October 2017, the Secretary of the Committee wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee regarding the Applicant's request of 10 October 2017, informing the Parties of the Committee's decision to admit the Counter-Memorial into the record and to modify the procedural calendar.\n\n71.\n\nBy letter of 17 October 2017, the Applicant responded to the Respondents' letter of 5 October 2017 regarding the alleged breach of the *status quo*.\n\n72.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2017, the Applicant requested that the deadline to submit its Reply on Annulment be extended \"in light of the recent political developments in Zimbabwe.\" The Committee subsequently invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's request by 24 November 2017.\n\n73.\n\nBy letter of 23 November 2017, the Respondents, on behalf of the Parties, submitted an agreed amended procedural calendar. The Committee confirmed the amended procedural calendar on 24 November 2017.\n\n74.\n\nBy letter of 29 November 2017, the Respondents informed the Committee that the First Claimant in ICSID Case No ARB/10/15, Mr R\u00fcdiger von Pezold, had passed away. The Respondents subsequently filed a Power of Attorney in respect of Mr R\u00fcdiger von Pezold's estate on 7 April 2018.\n\n75.\n\nPursuant to the amended procedural calendar, on 16 January 2018, the Applicant filed its Reply on Annulment (the \"**Reply**\"). On 22 January 2018, the Applicant submitted an amended version of its Reply, together with Exhibits ZA-235 to ZA-312, including witness statements of Ms Virginia Sithole (Exhibit ZA-306), Mr Onias Claver Masiwa (Exhibit ZA-307), the Honourable Prince Machaya (Exhibit ZA-308) and Ms Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell (Exhibit ZA-309), as well as an additional witness statement of Ms Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell (Exhibit ZA-237), and Legal Authorities ZALEX-124 to ZALEX-217.\n\n76.\n\nBy letter of 6 February 2018, the Applicant requested directions from the Committee in advance of the hearing and informed the Committee of its intention to reach an agreement on certain matters with the Respondents. By email of that same date, the Respondents stated that the matters referred to by the Applicant should be addressed after the last pleading had been filed.\n\n77.\n\nBy email of 8 February 2018 transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat, the Committee acknowledged the Parties' communications of 6 February 2017 and proposed a date and time for the pre-hearing teleconference. Included with the email was a draft agenda on which the Committee invited the Parties' comments by 14 February 2018; this deadline was subsequently extended to 7 March 2018.\n\n78.\n\nAlso by email of 8 February 2018, the Applicant requested that \"the Committees [...] direct 'that [new evidence which was not filed in the original arbitrations] will not be considered by the Committees and should not be filed in the first instance.'\" The Committee subsequently invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's request by 9 February 2018.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter of 9 February 2018, the Respondents commented on the Applicant's request of 8 February 2018.\n\n80.\n\nBy letter of 12 February 2018, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee regarding the Applicant's request of 8 February 2018. The Committee denied the Applicant's request, noting that while Section 16.2 of Procedural Order No 1 provides that the Committee expects that \"the parties will primarily refer to the evidentiary record of the arbitration proceedings,\" evidence not submitted in the arbitration proceedings is not as such inadmissible in these annulment proceedings.\n\n81.\n\nPursuant to the amended procedural calendar, on 5 March 2018, the Respondents filed their Rejoinder on Annulment (the \"**Rejoinder**\"), together with Exhibits VPB-283 to VPB-317 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-101 to VPBLEX-119.\n\n82.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the Respondents submitted their comments on the proposed draft agenda for the pre-hearing teleconference; the Applicant submitted its comments on 8 March 2018.\n\n83.\n\nOn 9 March 2018, the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Secretary of the Committee and the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n84.\n\nBy letter of 10 March 2018, the Applicant submitted to the Committee a response to an alleged new argument made by the Respondents during the pre-hearing organizational meeting. By email of 11 March 2018, the Respondents sought leave from the Committee to respond to the Applicant's letter.\n\n85.\n\nLater on 11 March 2018, by email transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat, the Committee informed the Parties that it had been sufficiently briefed on the matter, and that the Parties should refrain from submitting further comments unless invited to do so by the Committee. Accordingly, the Committee denied the Respondents' request for leave to respond to the Applicant's 10 March 2018 letter.\n\n86.\n\nBy letter of 12 March 2018, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee regarding the organization of the upcoming hearing on annulment, including a deadline for the Parties to exchange Skeleton Arguments on Annulment.\n\n87.\n\nOn 20 March 2018, pursuant to the Committee's letter of 12 March 2018, the Parties filed their Skeleton Arguments on Annulment.\n\n88.\n\nA hearing on annulment was held in Paris, France, on 3-5 April 2018 (the \"**Hearing**\"). In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, the following individuals were present at the Hearing:\n\n*For the Applicant* :\n\nMr Philip Kimbrough Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nMr Tristan Moreau Kimbrough & Associ\u00e9s\n\nThe Honourable Prince Machaya Attorney General of the Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Fortune Chimbaru Acting Director Civil Division, Attorney General's Office, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Elizabeth Sumowah Legal Advisor, Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Varaidzo Zifudzi Principal Director, Legal Services, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Chrispen Mavodza Director, Legal Affairs Department Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell Judge, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMs Virginia Sithole Resident legal advisor, Exchange Control, Reserve Bank, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\nMr Onias Claver Masiwa Chief Inspector Exchange Control, Head of Exchange Control Inspectorate of the Reserve Bank, Republic of Zimbabwe\n\n*For the Respondents* :\n\nMr Matthew Coleman Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMs Helen Aldridge Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMr Thomas Innes Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMs Vivian Fischer Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP\n\nMr Charles O. Verrill, Jr Attorney at Law\n\nMr Heinrich von Pezold\n\n*Court Reporters* :\n\nMs Diana Burden Diana Burden Ltd\n\nMs Laurie Carlisle Diana Burden Ltd\n\n89.\n\nOn 29 June 2018, each Party filed its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n90.\n\nBy letter of 6 July 2018, the Respondents wrote to the Committee alleging that the Applicant had raised new issues in its Post-Hearing Brief and requesting that the Committee not consider these new issues. The Applicant responded by letter of 9 July 2018.\n\n91.\n\nBy letter of 17 July 2018 transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat, the Committee informed the Parties that it will consider the Parties' submissions in the course of its deliberations. If the Committee finds that the Applicant has raised new arguments not previously made in the course of the proceedings, it will determine the consideration to be given to them.\n\n92.\n\nOn 20 July 2018, each Party filed its Submission on Costs. With its submission, the Applicant filed Legal Authorities ZALEX-218 to ZALEX-225; with their submission, the Respondents filed Legal Authorities VPBLEX-120 to VPBLEX-136.\n\n93.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, each Party filed its Reply Submissions on Costs.\n\n94.\n\nOn 24 September 2018, the Committee closed the proceeding.\n\n**III. THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMS**\n-----------------\n\n95.\n\nThe dispute that was the subject matter of the original arbitration arose out of the Land Reform Program (\"**LRP**\") implemented by the Government of Zimbabwe through a series of measures that were first introduced after the independence of Zimbabwe in 1979. The aim of the LRP was to acquire (initially on a willing buyer-willing seller basis but subsequently allowing compulsory transfers) agricultural land from large-scale farms for purposes of resettlement.3 However, the implementation of the LRP was hampered, *inter alia*, by lack of funds to compensate land owners and progress was slow in the first ten years of independence.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 97.\n\n96.\n\nOn 15 July 2000, the Government introduced a Fast Track Land Reform Program (\"**FTLRP**\"), which, *inter alia*, removed compensation provisions for agricultural land acquired compulsorily by the State. The introduction of the FTLRP also marked the beginning of the \"invasions\" by settlers of predominantly white-owned farms, including those owned by the VPBs.4 In 2005, the Constitution of Zimbabwe was amended to acquire and vest in the State title to land which had been previously identified as being subject to the LRP. No compensation was payable for such land and persons having any right or interest in the land were prohibited from applying to the court or challenging the acquisition of the land by the State.5\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 107-110.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 116.\n\n97.\n\nThe VPBs, through the Border Claimants, owned three estates in Zimbabwe (the \"**Estates**\"): (i) the Forrester Estate, \"essentially a tobacco growing and curing operation set on 22,000 ha of land [...] in the North of Zimbabwe;\"6 (ii) the Border Estate, \"an integrated forestry plantation comprising 28 properties with pine and eucalyptus (gum) plantations [\u2026] and three sawmills set on 47,886 ha of land and located in [\u2026] the East of Zimbabwe;\"7 and (iii) the Makandi Estate, \"a mixed plantation, growing coffee, bananas, maize, macadamia nuts, avocados, and timber for the production of transmission poles, set on 8,389 ha and spread across nine properties [\u2026] in the East of Zimbabwe.\"8\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 119.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 126.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 135.\n\n98.\n\nThe VPBs stated that, as a result of the 2005 constitutional amendment, Zimbabwe had compulsorily acquired all but ten properties they owned, without any compensation. They also submitted that the remaining ten properties were not viable on their own and had thus been rendered worthless. They further alleged that before being formally acquired by Zimbabwe, invasions took place on the Estates, causing much damage while the police and armed forces failed to properly intervene and protect white farmers.\n\n99.\n\nThe VPBs alleged that, as a result of the events summarized above, Zimbabwe had breached Articles 4(2) (expropriation), 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment), 2(2) (nonimpairment), 4(1) (full protection and security) and 5 (free transfer of payments) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, as well as Articles 6(1) (expropriation), 4(1) (fair and equitable treatment, non-impairment and full protection and security) and 5 (free transfer of payments) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.\n\n**B. THE PROCEDURE BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nOn 11 June 2010, ICSID registered a Request for Arbitration filed by the VBPs.\n\n101.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, ICSID registered another Request for Arbitration filed by the Border Claimants.\n\n102.\n\nPursuant to the agreement between the Parties, two identically composed Tribunals were constituted to rule on both claims in two conjoined arbitration proceedings. The Tribunals were subsequently reconstituted three times, following resignations of members appointed by Zimbabwe.\n\n103.\n\nAt the first procedural joint session held on 7 February 2011, Zimbabwe indicated that it did not intend to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Parties agreed that they would exchange two rounds of submissions on the merits of the VPBs' claims.\n\n104.\n\nOn 31 October 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1, ruling on document production requests.\n\n105.\n\nOn 15 November 2011, the VPBs submitted their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n106.\n\nOn 26 June 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2, which dismissed applications to participate as non-disputing parties submitted by the European Centre for Constitution and Human Rights and four indigenous communities of Zimbabwe.\n\n107.\n\nOn 11 August 2012, Zimbabwe filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n108.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, the VPBs filed their Reply on the Merits and Ancillary Claims.\n\n109.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, Zimbabwe, now represented by new counsel, submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits, including Objections to Jurisdiction to the Claimants' Original Claim and Observations on Ancillary Claims.\n\n110.\n\nOn 11 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 3, which disposed of an application by the VPBs, *inter alia*, to strike out jurisdictional challenges and other defenses allegedly raised for the first time by Zimbabwe in its Rejoinder on the Merits, despite its submissions to the contrary during the first procedural joint session. In Procedural Order No 3, the Tribunal admitted Zimbabwe's jurisdictional objections into the record, acknowledging \"special circumstances\" within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3). The Tribunal further joined Zimbabwe's jurisdictional challenges to the merits and vacated the previously set hearing dates to accommodate further briefing on the new issues.\n\n111.\n\nOn 1 March 2013, the VPBs filed their Observations on the Rejoinder and a Response to Observations on Ancillary Claims.\n\n112.\n\nOn 16 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 4, which addressed the VPBs' application for an order for provisional measures, alleging that intruders had entered their properties in Zimbabwe. The VPBs requested that the Tribunal order Zimbabwe to instruct its police forces either (i) to prevent intruders from entering the Estates; or (ii) if intruders had already entered the Estates, to remove them. In Procedural Order No 4, the Tribunal dismissed the VPBs' application. First, the Tribunal acknowledged Zimbabwe's statement that it had instructed its police to maintain the *status quo* on the Estates as at the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration. Second, the Tribunal acknowledged Zimbabwe's undertaking to instruct its police forces to act upon any report on intrusion into the VPBs' properties. The Tribunal noted that the VPBs themselves had stated that Zimbabwe's forces had already removed most of the intruders and helped the VPBs to restore damaged or stolen property. However, the Tribunal instructed the Parties not to aggravate the dispute further and to maintain the *status quo* until the resolution of the dispute.\n\n113.\n\nOn 3 April 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 5, addressing an application by the VPBs for urgent interim relief. The VPBs alleged that Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Office was planning to assassinate one of the Claimants, Mr Heinrich von Pezold. By Procedural Ordered No 5, the Tribunal ordered Zimbabwe to implement immediately, in cooperation with VPBs, measures of protection to ensure Mr Heinrich von Pezold's safety. The Tribunal also ordered Zimbabwe to report periodically on the implementation and effectiveness of such protection measures.\n\n114.\n\nOn 19 April 2013, Zimbabwe filed its Response to Observations on the Rejoinder (\"**Rebutter**\").\n\n115.\n\nOn 15 May 2013, the VPBs submitted an updated request for relief and introduced a correction to the quantum of their claims.\n\n116.\n\nOn 22 July 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 6, addressing a further request for provisional measures advanced by the VPBs, which was prompted by the entry of new intruders into the properties. In Procedural Order No 6, the Tribunal dismissed the application on the basis, *inter alia*, that the VPBs had failed to adduce evidence warranting the wide-ranging measures requested and to show emergency and necessity, as required under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1).\n\n117.\n\nOn 8 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7, addressing the VPBs' objections to (i) Zimbabwe's new jurisdictional objection, allegedly raised for the first time on 19 April 2013; and (ii) the new evidence submitted in support of the objection. After an exchange of submissions on this issue, the Tribunal dismissed the VPBs' objections and amended the briefing schedule to allow for the objection to be pleaded by both Parties.\n\n118.\n\nOn 15 August 2013, Zimbabwe filed its Re-Rebutter (*i.e.*, an addendum to its 19 April 2013 Response to Observations on the Rejoinder).\n\n119.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the VPBs filed a Response to the Re-Rebutter. Together with this pleading, the VPBs submitted Exhibit C-858, which is a letter dated 12 November 1992 from the Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited to Tanks Group Services Limited. The letter describes an approval given by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for Tanks Consolidated Investment Limited (a Bahamian subsidiary of the Belgian bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique) to transfer a Zimbabwean company (then-named \"Tanks Investments (Zimbabwe) Ltd,\" and from 24 August 1999 named \"Franconian Zimbabwe Investments (Pvt) Ltd\") (\"**Franconian**\")) from Tanks Consolidated Investments Ltd to another subsidiary of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique, Saxonian Estates Ltd of Jersey (\"**Saxonian**\"). In their 9 September 2013 Response to the Re-Rebutter, the VPBs stated that Exhibit C-858 constituted evidence of approval of one of their investments by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.\n\n120.\n\nOn the same day, 9 September 2013, Zimbabwe filed observations on the Claimants' 15 May 2013 updated request for relief and corrected quantum.\n\n121.\n\nOn 25 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8, following Zimbabwe's request to extend the page limit of its 26 September 2013 submission, in order to allow it to properly reply to the VPBs' three new arguments raised in their 9 September 2013 Response to the Re-Rebutter. In Procedural Order No 8, the Tribunal reminded Zimbabwe that it had been afforded ample opportunity to plead its case at all stages of the proceedings. The Tribunal also recalled its decisions in (i) Procedural Order No 3, whereby Zimbabwe's jurisdictional objections were all admitted on the record despite its previous undertakings not to file jurisdictional objections; and (ii) Procedural Order No 7, whereby the Tribunal allowed additional jurisdictional arguments to be raised belatedly. In the circumstances, the Tribunal was not prepared to reopen Procedural Order No 7 and dismissed the Respondent's request for a page limit extension.\n\n122.\n\nOn 26 September 2013, Zimbabwe filed its Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter (*i.e.*, a response to the VPBs' 9 September 2013 submission). Zimbabwe's submission was accompanied by a second witness statement from Mr Grasiano Nyaguse and a third witness statement from Mr Onias Masiiwa. Zimbabwe argued that Exhibit C-858 showed that (i) the VPBs were aware that approval from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe was required for the acquisition of their investments; and that (ii) the VPBs could not show that all of their investments had been approved. Zimbabwe also indicated that Exhibit C-858 related to a transaction between two subsidiaries of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique and did not concern the VPBs.\n\n123.\n\nOn the same date, the VPBs filed their response to Zimbabwe's 9 September 2013 submission.\n\n124.\n\nOn 2 October 2013, Zimbabwe applied to the Tribunal, *inter alia*, to seek confirmation that its Re-Rebutter Reply and its 9 September 2013 Quantum Reply, and accompanying evidence, were fully on the record.\n\n125.\n\nOn 11 October 2013, the President of the Tribunal and the Parties convened a telephone conference during which it was agreed that there was no reason to postpone the hearing scheduled to start on 28 October 2013. Both Parties also made oral submissions on Zimbabwe's 2 October 2013 application.\n\n126.\n\nOn 12 October 2013, Zimbabwe further requested the Tribunal to order the VPBs to submit any further \"approval/illegality exhibits they may have 'overlooked' through 10 December 2013.\" Zimbabwe also sought leave to reply to any further submission of documents.\n\n127.\n\nFollowing these two applications, the Parties agreed to the admission of certain material filed by Zimbabwe with its 9 and 26 September 2013 pleadings, while leaving other material subject to the determination of the Tribunal.\n\n128.\n\nOn 14 October 2013, both Parties filed their Skeleton Arguments.\n\n129.\n\nOn 15 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 9. The Tribunal found that the approval/illegality objections raised by Zimbabwe in its 26 September 2013 Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter (which raised the alleged illegality of all of the VPBs' investments for failure to comply with Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations) had been expanded in breach of the Tribunal's directions contained notably in Procedural Order Nos 3 and 7. The Tribunal determined that there were no \"special circumstances\" warranting the admission into the record at such a late stage of this expanded version of Zimbabwe's objections. The Tribunal also ruled that certain passages in the two witness statements filed by Zimbabwe with its Re-Rebutter Reply, which addressed the wider version of its illegality objection, should be redacted, while several other documents also filed with the submission would not be admitted into the record.\n\n130.\n\nFrom 28 October to 2 November 2013, a hearing on jurisdiction, liability and quantum was held in Washington, D.C. As discussed further below, on Day 4 of the hearing, Mr Yves Fortier, the President of the Tribunal, mentioned that he was currently acting as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board, and inquired whether either Party would have any issue if the secretary of the Sanctions Board sat in on that day's proceedings. Separately from this issue, Zimbabwe contends in this annulment proceeding that during the examination of witnesses at the hearing, the President of the Tribunal made allegedly inappropriate or biased comments to Zimbabwe's witnesses.\n\n131.\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 10, which dealt with the Parties' proposed corrections to the hearing transcript. The Tribunal also admitted into the record material submitted by Zimbabwe in response to questions formulated during the hearing. Procedural Order No 10 also set out the procedure for post-hearing submissions and denied a further request by Zimbabwe for an extension of time.\n\n132.\n\nOn 7 May 2014, both Parties submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n133.\n\nOn 6 June 2014, the VPBs filed a Statement on Inadmissible Material Contained in Zimbabwe's Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n134.\n\nOn 2 July 2014, Zimbabwe submitted its Response to the Statement on Inadmissible Material. In its submission, Zimbabwe also made a number of procedural requests relating to (i) the admissibility of several of the VPBs' submissions which allegedly raised new arguments and contained new evidence; and (ii) Zimbabwe's right to file an additional submission on these new issues.\n\n135.\n\nOn 9 July 2014, the VPBs filed their Reply to Zimbabwe's Response to the Statement on Inadmissible Material.\n\n136.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 11. The Tribunal indicated that it required no further briefing on Zimbabwe's 2 July 2014 submission.\n\n137.\n\nOn 5 September 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 12, in which it denied the last five procedural requests made by Zimbabwe in its 2 July 2014 pleading, including its request to be allowed to file a further brief on the alleged new arguments raised by the Claimants. The Tribunal also reserved its decision on the first five procedural requests for the Award.\n\n138.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on whether it should issue a single award or two separate awards. Zimbabwe supported the former approach, while the Claimants preferred the latter option.\n\n139.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the Parties submitted their Submission on Costs and Fees.\n\n140.\n\nOn 18 December 2014, the Parties submitted their Reply Submissions on Costs and Fees.\n\n141.\n\nOn 23 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 13, ruling that two awards should be rendered. Although the Tribunal found that the claims were fundamentally intertwined, it held that since the von Pezold and Border Claimants had elected to file two separate claims, they were entitled to pursue enforcement of any award independently.\n\n142.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, the Tribunal declared the proceedings in both cases closed, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**C. THE AWARD**\n----------------\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal rendered its Award on 28 July 2015.\n\n144.\n\nThe Award deals with fifteen separate issues, with numerous sub-issues, relating to: (i) the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the VPBs' investments under both the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT; (ii) Zimbabwe's approval and illegality objections to the admissibility of the claims; (iii) attribution to Zimbabwe of conduct of settlers and of political statements of the President of Zimbabwe and of certain Government officials; (iv) proportionality, regulation and margin of appreciation; (v) the alleged expropriation of the VPBs' investments; (vi) the alleged breach by Zimbabwe of the fair and equitable treatment standard; (vii) the alleged impairment by Zimbabwe of the VPBs' investments; (viii) the alleged breach by Zimbabwe of the full protection and security standard; (ix) the alleged breach by Zimbabwe of the free transfer of payments standard; (x) Zimbabwe's necessity defense; (xi) the alleged lack of causation between Zimbabwe's conduct and the VPBs' loss; (xii) remedies available to the VPBs under the BITs; (xiii) interest applicable in case compensation was awarded; (xiv) the VPBs' requests for declaratory relief; and (xv) costs of arbitration.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, noting that (i) it was not contested that the case involved a legal dispute within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;9 and that (ii) Zimbabwe had consented to the submission of the dispute to the Centre.10 The Tribunal also upheld its jurisdiction *ratione personae* as well as its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under both the ICSID Convention11 and the BITs.12 The Tribunal also found jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT (which Zimbabwe only challenged under that Treaty, but not under the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT).13\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 190.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 199.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 205 and 225 (with the exception of claims by Mr R\u00fcdiger von Pezold, over which it retained jurisdiction solely under the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT).\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 225 and 285-286.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 337-343.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal then turned to Zimbabwe's objections to admissibility based on the alleged lack of approval and illegality of the VPBs' investments (the \"**Approval Objection**\" and the \"**Illegality Objection**,\" respectively), noting that Zimbabwe had presented its objections regarding the legality of the VPBs' investments and their approval as objections to admissibility rather than to jurisdiction.14 The Tribunal determined to treat Zimbabwe's objections as admissibility objections, consistent with Zimbabwe's pleadings, but noted that the characterization of the objections was immaterial to its decision.15\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 344-346.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 346 (save for the MFN argument, which the Tribunal did not find necessary to consider).\n\n147.\n\nIn view of the seriousness of the arguments made by Zimbabwe in its Post-Hearing Brief regarding alleged procedural abuse and violation of its right to be heard, the Tribunal reviewed in detail the procedural history of the case. The Tribunal considered it \"vital for its unanimous determination that PO No 9 should be reconfirmed again,\" and it so decided.16\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 347-402.\n\n148.\n\nAs to Zimbabwe's Approval Objection, which was based on Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal noted that the provision appeared to conflict with Ad Article 2(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT. Article 9(b) appeared to require formal approval of investments, while Ad Article 2(a) did not contain any such requirement. Relying on the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Tribunal concluded that there was no specific requirement of approval.17 The Tribunal further found that Zimbabwe was in any event estopped from denying that it had given approval to the VPBs' investments, if approval was required.18 Accordingly, the Tribunal dismissed Zimbabwe's Approval Objection.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 409.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 411.\n\n149.\n\nAs to the Illegality Objection, the Tribunal found that it was not convinced that the VPBs had breached any of Zimbabwe's laws, but even if they had, the Respondent was estopped from denying that BIT protection existed.19\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 416.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal then dealt with two of Zimbabwe's remaining 2 July 2014 requests relating to the alleged new evidence given by Mr R\u00fcdiger von Pezold during his examination at the hearing, to the effect that Exhibit C-858 related to the VPBs' investments. Zimbabwe had applied for an opportunity to file further submissions on that alleged new evidence, but the Tribunal had reserved its decision for the Award. The Tribunal agreed with the VPBs that Mr R\u00fcdiger von Pezold had simply misconstrued the letter and found that his statement did not constitute new evidence warranting further pleadings from Zimbabwe.20\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 423-430.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to dismiss most of Zimbabwe's arguments on attribution, concluding that the conduct of State organs was attributable to the State, except if performed in purely private capacity, which issue did not arise in this case.21 The Tribunal dismissed the VPBs' argument that the actions of the settlers were attributable to the State.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 450 (the Tribunal did accept Zimbabwe's arguments that the acts of Settlers/War Veterans did not meet the test of ILC Article 8 and thus were not attributable to the State).\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal also dismissed Zimbabwe's arguments on the applicability of the doctrine of proportionality and margin of appreciation,22 noting that neither doctrine could be used to justify illegal conduct based on racial discrimination.23\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 460-463.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 467.\n\n153.\n\nOn the merits, the Tribunal upheld the great majority of the VPBs' claims, finding that Zimbabwe had (i) unlawfully expropriated the VPBs' investments, including those which had not been formally seized but had been rendered worthless as a result of the expropriation of other properties.24 The Tribunal also held that Zimbabwe had breached (ii) the fair and equitable treatment standards in Article 2(1) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 4(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT;25 (iii) the non-impairment standard in Article 2(2) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 4(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT;26 (iv) the full protection and security standard in Article 4(1) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 4(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT;27 and (v) the free transfer of payments standard in Article 5 of Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 5 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.28\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 488-521.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 542-561.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 576-581.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 593-599.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 605-609.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Zimbabwe's necessity defense, finding that it did not meet the requirements of Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"**ILC Articles**\"), which the Parties agreed governed the issue. More specifically, the Tribunal noted that Zimbabwe had not declared a state of emergency at the relevant time, and that the settlers constituted a minority of the overall citizenry; accordingly their actions \"were of a scale that was not uncontrollable by the Government and the police forces.\"29 On the contrary, \"the Zimbabwean Government chose to inflame the situation rather than dissolve it through legal means.\"30 Zimbabwe had thus failed to demonstrate a threat to the essential interests of the State.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 630.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 630.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal also found, in connection with Zimbabwe's necessity defense, that the land occupations by the settlers did not constitute a threat to the survival of the State and accordingly the measures taken by Zimbabwe had not been taken to save Zimbabwe of a \"grave and imminent peril.\"31 The Tribunal further ruled that the measures taken by Zimbabwe were not the \"only way\" to deal with the unrest at hand,32 and that its conduct was racially motivated and breached \"its obligation *erga omnes* not to engage in racial discrimination.\"33 As a result, Zimbabwe's conduct constituted \"an impairment to the international community as a whole and ILC Article 25(1)(b) precludes a defense of necessity [in such a case].\"34\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 637.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 642-646.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 657.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 657.\n\n156.\n\nFinally, further in connection with Zimbabwe's necessity defense, the Tribunal held that Zimbabwe \"not only contributed to its economic decline and but was also one of the primary instigators of the situation.\"35 Accordingly, Zimbabwe could not invoke the necessity defense in Article 25 of the ILC Articles.36\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 667.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 668.\n\n157.\n\nHaving found Zimbabwe liable for breaches of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal ordered Zimbabwe to restitute the VPBs' assets that had been unlawfully expropriated and awarded compensation to the VPBs for \"land damage and losses of productivity,\" to achieve full reparation.37 The Tribunal further awarded the von Pezold Claimants, should restitution occur, compensation in the amount of US$ 56,710,037. Should restitution not occur within the restitution window fixed by the Tribunal, the von Pezold Claimants were amounted compensation for their loss in the amount of US$ 186,814,861. The Tribunal further awarded the von Pezold Claimants the amount of US$ 7,186,302 in reimbursement of loans contracted by the von Pezold Claimants and the repayment of which had been impeded by Zimbabwe. The Tribunal also awarded US$ 1,000,000 in moral damages to Mr Heinrich von Pezold.38\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 744.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 1020.\n\n158.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal awarded pre-award and post-award compound interest, while ordering Zimbabwe to pay to the von Pezold Claimants 92% of the costs and expenses of the arbitration.39\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 1023-1024.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT: SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Applicant seeks the annulment of the Award, in its entirety, on eight separate grounds. These eight grounds are formulated on the basis of four of the five grounds of annulment in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (iii) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iv) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n160.\n\nThis Section sets out a summary of the Parties' positions on the eight annulment grounds relied upon by the Applicant (and as formulated by the Applicant). The Parties' positions are addressed in more detail in Section V, which deals with the Committee's decisions.\n\n**A. GROUND 1: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\u2014DENIAL OF RIGHT TO BE HEARD ON THE ILLEGALITY OBJECTION (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Applicant submits that it has been denied the right to be heard on its jurisdictional objections, including the supporting evidence.\n\n162.\n\nMore specifically, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal, by way of Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9, wrongly excluded the evidence relating to its jurisdictional objections, which challenged the legality of the Respondents' investments.40\n\nMemorial, paras 15, 18 and 182; Tr Day 1, 43:21-44:8.\n\n163.\n\nFirst, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal, in Procedural Order No 7, afforded it insufficient time to argue properly its jurisdictional objections.41 In Procedural Order No 8, the Tribunal refused the Applicant's request to extend by three to four pages the page limit applicable to its reply submissions on the issue.42 Finally, in Procedural Order No 9, the Tribunal allegedly unduly restricted the Applicant's right to address and respond to the issues raised by the relevant evidence, specifically Exhibit C-858.43 The Applicant in particular complains of the Tribunal's decisions in Procedural Order No 9 (i) to refuse its submission of evidence responsive to Exhibit C-858 and (ii) to order the redaction of several paragraphs included in three of its witness statements and expert reports which dealt with issues raised by Exhibit C-858.44\n\nProcedural Order No 7 (**VPB-137**); Tr Day 1, 101:5-102:7.\n\nProcedural Order No 8 (**VPB-139**).\n\nProcedural Order No 9 (**VPB-148**). Exhibit C-858 in the original arbitration has been refiled by the Applicant as Exhibit ZA-045 in this annulment proceeding.\n\nMemorial, paras 19-46; Procedural Order No 9 (**VPB-148**).\n\n164.\n\nThe Applicant contends that Procedural Order No 9 was also influenced by the bias of Mr Yves Fortier, the President of the Tribunal, towards the Applicant and to his belatedly disclosed role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board.45 The Applicant argues that, due to his bias, Mr Fortier attributed the majority of the delays in the proceedings solely to the Applicant and ensured, through Procedural Order No 9, that the schedule would not be derailed by the Applicant's jurisdictional objections.46 According to the Applicant, another telling example of the President's bias was the limited consideration given to the Applicant's submissions at the hearing to reconsider Procedural Order No 9.47\n\nMemorial, paras 37-54 and 121-165; Tr Day 1, 36:2-21.\n\nMemorial, paras 43-46.\n\nMemorial, paras 47-50.\n\n165.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the President's bias is further evidenced by his Kaplan lecture on corruption issues in international arbitration, delivered when the arbitration proceedings were still pending. The Applicant submits that the lecture confirms that Mr Fortier prejudged the issues in the arbitration by attributing responsibility for corruption mainly to government officials, which made him more receptive to the Respondents' arguments that the Applicant's officials were corrupt when implementing the LRP.48\n\nMemorial, paras 51-54.\n\n166.\n\nIn the Applicant's view, as a result of these events, it was deprived of its fundamental right to be heard and accordingly the Award stands to be annulled under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondents deny that the Award breached Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. In particular, they argue that the Applicant has not shown that it was effectively deprived of its right to be heard. Indeed, according to the Respondents, the scope of the right to be heard is not without limits; it only requires that the parties be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to present their case, within the procedural limits determined by the arbitral tribunal. Consequently, when the Tribunal ruled that the Applicant's evidence and arguments relating to its Illegality Objection were raised out of time and were inadmissible, the Applicant was not deprived of the right to be heard as it had been given sufficient opportunity to plead its case but failed to take advantage of it.49\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 251-262.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondents argue that, in any event, the Applicant has failed to show that even if a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure occurred, it was so serious as to warrant annulment of the Award.50 According to the Respondent, it is only if, but for the alleged departure, the outcome of the Award would have been substantially different, that such departure could be considered serious.51 According to the Respondents, the Applicant has failed to meet the required threshold for annulment.\n\nTr Day 2, 432:19-436:15.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 273.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondents further contend that decisions such as Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9 cannot be reviewed on annulment since an ICSID tribunal is the sole judge of admissibility and probative value of evidence.52\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 22 and 274; Tr Day 2, 300:2-301:10.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondents deny what they describe as the unsupported allegations of bias or prejudgement on the part of Mr Fortier when dealing with the Applicant's requests to adduce untimely and inadmissible evidence.\n\n171.\n\nIn particular, the Respondents highlight that in Procedural Order No 7, the Tribunal granted the exact time the Applicant requested, while permitting it to plead its Illegality Objection out of time.53\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 114.\n\n172.\n\nLikewise, according to the Respondents, the Tribunal's decision in Procedural Order No 8 to refuse the Applicant's request for an extension of the page limit was justified. Indeed, in its decision, the Tribunal rejected the Applicant's contention that the request was warranted to allow it to respond to new arguments raised by the Respondents as the admittedly new arguments were raised, in accordance with Procedural Order No 7, in response to the Applicant's own unauthorized submissions on approval and illegality. As a result, the Tribunal did not agree to the Applicant pleading these issues any further.54\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 155-157.\n\n173.\n\nFinally, as to Procedural Order No 9, the unredacted sections of the witness statements and expert reports targeted by the redaction order still stood as rebuttal evidence to Exhibit C-858 [ZA-45].55 The Respondents further note that although the Tribunal, in Procedural Order No 9, excluded the Applicant's latest pleading on the Illegality Objection as having been filed out of time, it accepted into the record nineteen out of the 21 documents that were submitted in support.56\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 274.16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 182.\n\n174.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the Respondents, the President of the Tribunal dealt with the Applicant's many vexatious motions fairly and enforced the applicable procedural rules in an even-handed fashion.57 As a result, the Applicant was not deprived of its right to be heard and there is no basis to annul the Award.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 22 and 274; Tr Day 2, 398:9-399:6.\n\n**B. GROUND 2: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\u2014 DEPRIVING ZIMBABWE OF THE RIGHT TO CONSIDER, BE HEARD AND IMPLEMENT DISQUALIFICATION IN A MEANINGFUL TIME AND MANNER BEFORE CLOSURE OF RECORD (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Applicant's submissions on the second ground of annulment focus on the timing and the manner in which the President of the Tribunal disclosed his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board.\n\n176.\n\nNotably, the Applicant contends that the late disclosure by the President of his role, made in passing on Day 4 of the final hearing in the original arbitration, deprived it of sufficient time to consider and apply for his disqualification.58\n\nReply, paras 807 *et seq.* ; Tr Day 1, 13:23-14:19.\n\n177.\n\nThe late disclosure also meant that a disqualification application would have been meaningless. Even if the Applicant had succeeded in disqualifying the President on the basis of his late disclosure, this would have had only a prospective effect. It would not have allowed for the correction of the decisions that the Tribunal had already taken, which had been tainted by the President's bias, and in any event, the evidentiary record was effectively closed at the end of the hearing, soon after the disclosure.59\n\nReply, paras 830-831; Tr Day 1, 98:4-99:4.\n\n178.\n\nAs a result, even if the Applicant had been allowed enough time to consider and apply for disqualification of the President before the record was closed, this would not have provided an effective remedy. In the circumstances, the Applicant argues that the only efficient remedy is the annulment of the Award.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the President of the Tribunal was under no duty to disclose his involvement with the World Bank Sanctions Board, for three main reasons.60\n\nRejoinder, paras 258 *et seq*.\n\n180.\n\nFirst, the President's position as chairperson of the Sanctions Board does not have any bearing on his impartiality and independence in the arbitration. The World Bank Sanctions Board is an autonomous entity within the World Bank, and the chairperson of the Sanctions Board is not a World Bank employee.61\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 274.40-274.41; Tr Day 2, 424:18-425:10.\n\n181.\n\nSecond, according to the Respondents, the Sanctions Board can only apply sanctions on private entities. It has no authority to impose sanctions on States, State entities or public officials.62\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 274.41; Tr Day 2, 425:11-25.\n\n182.\n\nThird, the Respondents note that the subject matter of the arbitration had nothing to do with the international sanctions that had been imposed on Zimbabwe. The Tribunal referred to \"sanctions\" only in three contexts: (i) to determine the public purpose of the expropriation of the Respondents' investments as the measures were taken in the context of international sanctions applied mainly by the United States of America and the European Union; (ii) to deal with an argument relating to the foreign exchange rate proposed by the Respondents; and (iii) to address the Applicant's state of necessity defense.63\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 274.44; Tr Day 2, 426:6-428:16.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Applicant waived its right to rely on the President's alleged non-disclosure in these annulment proceedings as it failed to challenge him during the arbitration, or indeed in a timely manner under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).64\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 242-244 and 256-257; Tr Day 2, 504:6-17.\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondents point out that, had the Applicant succeeded in disqualifying the President during the arbitration, it could have applied to the re-constituted tribunal to reopen any procedural decisions issued by the earlier tribunal that it believed might have been tainted.65 Indeed, the Applicant did frequently seek to reopen unfavorable procedural decisions during the arbitration, which shows that in its own view reopening of such decisions was in principle possible.66\n\nTr Day 2, 501:22-502:23.\n\nRejoinder, paras 260-264.\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondents insist that in any event the record of the arbitration was not in any way tainted or biased.67 The Tribunal's decisions were based on the facts and they were soundly reasoned.68\n\nTr Day 2, 521:17-522:1.\n\nRejoinder, paras 265-266.\n\n186.\n\nIn conclusion, in the Respondents' view, the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure and accordingly there is no basis to annul the Award.\n\n**C. GROUND 3: TRIBUNAL NOT PROPERLY CONSTITUTED\u2014ARBITRATOR LACK OF IMPARTIALITY, BOTH PERCEIVED AND REAL, RAISING DOUBTS ON MR FORTIER'S INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY IN HIS ROLE AS PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL (ARTICLE 52(1)(A))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Applicant's third ground of annulment is also based on Mr Fortier's alleged late disclosure of his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board. According to the Applicant, Mr Fortier was under a continuing obligation to disclose any circumstance \"likely to give rise to justifiable doubts\" as to his reliability to exercise independent judgment.69 His failure to disclose his role in a timely fashion (that is, as soon as he had been appointed as chairperson of the Sanctions Board in May 2012)70 created justifiable doubts as to his impartiality.71\n\nAmended and Restated Application for Annulment, para 176.\n\nAmended and Restated Application for Annulment, para 178.\n\nAmended and Restated Application for Annulment, para 206; Memorial, paras 396-404; Tr Day 1, 14:17-19 and 58:25-59:5.\n\n188.\n\nThe Applicant points out that Mr Fortier's role as chairperson of the Sanctions Board was incompatible with his function as the President of the Tribunal. Since Zimbabwe was subject to a variety of international sanctions and these were referred to frequently during the proceedings, Mr Fortier could not sit, at the same time, as a chairperson of a sanctioning body and as President of the Tribunal.72 His role on the Sanctions Board made him also a contractor of an entity (the World Bank) which itself had repeatedly imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe.73\n\nReply, paras 835-847; Tr Day 1, 53:20-54:12.\n\nMemorial, paras 390-395; Tr Day 1, 54:13-24.\n\n189.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that Mr Fortier's partiality transpired on numerous occasions during the arbitration, *e.g.*, when he issued Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9,74 and when he made allegedly inappropriate comments to the Applicant's witnesses during the hearing.75\n\nMemorial, paras 317-318; Tr Day 1, 28:8-25, 36:2-21, 40:2-18, 43:21-44:8.\n\nMemorial, paras 322, 367, 557; Witness Statement of the Honourable Prince Machaya dated 7 June 2017 (**ZA-160**), paras 49-52, Tr Day 1, 114:5-25.\n\n190.\n\nAccordingly, Mr Fortier's function on the Sanctions Board, coupled with the specific factual and procedural background of the arbitration, created reasonable doubt as to his independence and impartiality towards the Applicant. As a result, the Applicant concludes that the Tribunal was not properly constituted, and the Award should be annulled.\n\n(**2)The Respondents' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Applicant has failed to discharge its burden of proof that the President's role as chairperson of the Sanctions Board created a manifest lack of impartiality or independence which had a material effect on the outcome of the arbitration. Notably, according to the Respondents, a reasonable third party would not have considered it \"obvious and highly probable\" that the President lacked independence or impartiality because of his parallel function.76\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 315; Rejoinder, para 245; Tr Day 2, 509:6-19.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondents argue that, in any event, Mr Fortier's alleged lack of impartiality or independence did not have any material effect on the outcome of the arbitration as the Award was unanimous, and neither of the other two members of the Tribunal was ever challenged by Zimbabwe.77\n\nRejoinder, para 246, Tr Day 2, 509:20-25.\n\n193.\n\nFor the reasons summarized in paragraphs 177 to 180 above, the Respondents insist that the President of the Tribunal was under no duty to disclose his position as chairperson of the Sanctions Board. Indeed, his role would not have created in the eyes of a reasonable person any justifiable doubts as to his reliability to exercise independent judgment, as the Sanctions Board's competence does not extend to States and public officials.78\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 368.\n\n194.\n\nLikewise, for the reasons summarized in paragraphs 181 to 184 above, the Respondents reiterate that the Applicant waived its right to rely on Mr Fortier's dual role to seek annulment of the Award as it failed to lodge a challenge against him during the arbitration.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, the Respondents contend that the Applicant's allegations as to Mr Fortier's alleged procedural bias and impropriety are misplaced. The numerous procedural decisions taken by the Tribunal which are now challenged by the Applicant on annulment were fair and fully justified in the circumstances.79 There was no improper conduct justifying the annulment of the Award.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 71, 114, 120-123, 126, 155-157, 166-167, 176, 182, 215-222, 290.\n\n**D. GROUND 4: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\u2014 MR FORTIER'S AND THE TRIBUNAL'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY DISCLOSE HIS ROLE AS CHAIRPERSON OF THE WORLD BANK SANCTIONS BOARD (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, both the third and the fourth ground of annulment refer to the same facts but are based on different legal grounds\u2014whereas the third ground refers to Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention (the Tribunal was not properly constituted), the fourth ground is based on Article 52(1)(d) (serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure). In particular, the Applicant contends that the President's duty to disclose any issue which could give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence is a \"fundamental rule of procedure.\"80\n\nMemorial, paras 382-389, 417; Tr Day 1, 48:10-49:17 and 50:22-51:17.\n\n197.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the President failed to abide by this fundamental rule of procedure when failing to disclose \"in a meaningful time and manner\" to the Parties his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board.81 As a result, the Award should be annulled.\n\nReply, para 848.\n\n**(2)The Respondents' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondents deny that the duty to disclose qualifies as a fundamental rule of procedure. In the Respondents' view, only the arbitrator's duty to remain impartial and independent, which forms part of the \"principles of natural justice,\" qualifies as such.82 Accordingly, even assuming Mr Fortier did fail to abide by his duty to disclose, he remained independent and impartial throughout the proceedings and therefore did not breach any fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.83\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 361.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 364; Rejoinder, paras 251-252.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondents also insist, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 177 to 180 above, that Mr Fortier was under no duty to disclose his position as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board. Similarly, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 181 to 184 above, the Applicant waived its right to rely on Mr Fortier's dual role and therefore cannot seek annulment of the Award.\n\n**E. GROUND 5: TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS\u2014FAILURE TO APPLY THE LAW TO THE APPLICANT'S EMERGENCY / NECESSITY DEFENSE WHILE RELYING ON ZIMBABWEAN LAW REGARDING DECLARATION OF STATE OF EMERGENCY (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to apply, or applied erroneously, the applicable law on three separate occasions.\n\n201.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal should not have applied Zimbabwean law to determine whether a state of emergency existed in Zimbabwe at the relevant time. Instead, it should have applied customary international law, as reflected in particular in the ILC Articles.84\n\nAmended and Restated Application for Annulment, paras 390-392; Memorial, paras 450-453; Tr Day 1, 132:5-22.\n\n202.\n\nSecond, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to apply Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT.85 According to the Applicant, this provision should have been considered by the Tribunal as a non-precluded measures clause. As such, it exonerated the Applicant from any liability for measures taken to safeguard public security and order. As a result, and by the operation of this provision, the Applicant should not have been held liable for the LRP, which was implemented to protect public security and order.86\n\nAd Article 3(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT Protocol provides, in part, that \"Measures necessary for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed 'treatment less favourable' within the meaning of Article 3\" (**VPBLEX-021**).\n\nMemorial, paras 442-444.\n\n203.\n\nThird, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to apply (or applied erroneously) Articles 7(1) and 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.87 In particular, the Tribunal should have applied these provisions to the effect that the Applicant's obligations to provide full security and to indemnify investors would have been \"nullified or at least suspended.\"88\n\nArticle 7(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT reads:  \n*Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or investors of any other State whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.*  \nArticle 7(2) of the same BIT reads:  \n*Without prejudice to paragraph (1) of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph suffer losses in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:*  \n*(a) requisitioning of their property by its forces or authorities, or*  \n*(b) destruction of their property by its forces or authorities, which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,   \nshall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable* (**VPBLEX-023**).\n\nMemorial, paras 477-484.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondents note, first, that the Tribunal applied Article 25 of the ILC Articles, which reflects customary international law, and not Zimbabwean law in determining whether the Applicant could invoke the necessity defense to excuse itself from liability.89\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 397-398 *referring to* Award (**VPB-174**), para 624; *see also* Tr Day 2, 478:16-479:4.\n\n205.\n\nSecond, the Respondents argue that Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT does not exclude measures taken for reasons of public security and order from compliance with the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT.90 Instead, it relates to the State's obligation to provide national treatment and most-favored nation (\"**MFN**\") treatment to foreign investors.\n\nTr Day 2, 479:23-480:16.\n\n206.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal did not fail to consider and apply Ad Article 3(a). Indeed, the Tribunal referred to the provision several times in the Award, when addressing the VPBs' claim for breach of the BIT's fair and equitable treatment standard.91 The Respondents note, in this connection, that the Applicant's characterization of Ad Article 3(a) as a treatybased necessity defense (or non-precluded measures clause) was expressly rejected by the Tribunal.92\n\nTr Day 2, 479:23-480:16; Counter-Memorial, para 402.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 404.\n\n207.\n\nThird, as to Article 7(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Respondents argue that the Tribunal did apply the provision and rejected Zimbabwe's position.93 In any event, Zimbabwe did not refer to Article 7(1) in the context of its necessity argument but rather argued that the provision should excuse it from its obligation to provide full protection and security in the event of national emergency.94\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 408; Tr Day 2, 481:12-482:1.\n\n*See* Award (**VPB-174**), paras 592-599; Tr Day 2, 478:4-10.\n\n208.\n\nAs to Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Respondents argue that Zimbabwe never explicitly relied on it in the arbitration as a defense, but merely referred to it in passing to argue that it should be excused from any obligation to compensate foreign investors due to the necessity of the situation.95\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 409.\n\n209.\n\nAlternatively, the Respondents maintain that should the Committee find that Zimbabwe did rely on Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, it should find that the Tribunal dismissed the argument either pursuant to Procedural Order No 3, as it was pleaded out of time, or because two of its triggering elements were missing (namely, that no state of emergency existed and that the destruction of the Respondents' assets was not warranted by the necessity of the situation).96\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 412.\n\n**F. GROUND 6: TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS\u2014FAILURE TO APPLY APPLICABLE LAW TO THE VPBS' CONCEALED FOREIGN INVESTMENT VIOLATIONS AND PREVIOUSLY WITHHELD INFORMATION AS PROVING THE ILLEGALITY OF THE VPBS' INVESTMENTS (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nUnder Ground 6, the Applicant argues that, under Article 9(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT97 and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT,98 the Tribunal had to apply Zimbabwean law to determine the legality of the VPBs' investments.99 However it failed to do so, most notably in relation to the requirement to seek the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's approval for each and every investment, as required by the Zimbabwean exchange control regulations.100\n\nGermany-Zimbabwe BIT Article 9(a) provides that \"This Agreement shall apply to all investments made before or after its entry into force by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party which have been or are: a) made in accordance with the laws of the latter Contracting Party\" (**VPBLEX-021**).\n\nSwitzerland-Germany BIT Article 2 provides that \"This Agreement shall apply to all investments made before or after its entry into force by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party which have been or are made in accordance with the laws of the latter Contracting Party\" (**VPBLEX-023**).\n\nMemorial, para 488; Tr Day 1, 232:4-240:6.\n\nReply, para 864.\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal also failed to take into account the Respondents' admission that their acquisition of one of the companies they controlled was made in breach of an undertaking made by the former owner of the company to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe that no change of beneficial ownership in that company would occur in the future.101 In view of this undertaking, the subsequent acquisition of the entity by the Respondents was a breach of the applicable exchange control regulations and thus illegal.102\n\n*See* Letter from the Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited to Tanks Group Services Limited dated 12 November 1992 (**ZA-045** / C-858 in the original arbitration).\n\nMemorial, paras 489-494; Tr Day 1, 86:3-16, 172:3-178:12.\n\n212.\n\nIn the Applicant's view, as a result, the Tribunal exceeded its powers when finding, in disregard of the applicable exchange control regulations, that the Respondents' investments were legal and thus qualified as investments protected under Article 9(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondents agree that the Tribunal indeed did not apply Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations to the Respondents' investments; however, this was entirely appropriate as Zimbabwe's argument regarding the alleged illegality of the Respondents' investments under the regulations had been dismissed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 9 as inadmissible. The remaining illegality arguments that were properly on record were dealt with by the Tribunal in the Award and were dismissed.103\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 421-422.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondents further contend that, in any event, the Tribunal also rejected the Applicant's argument on illegality on the basis that the Applicant was estopped from arguing that it had not approved the Respondents' investments.104 Consequently, even assuming the Tribunal had, in Procedural Order No 9, unjustifiably refused to consider the wider illegality objection advanced by the Applicant, it would still have dismissed the objection by way of estoppel.\n\nRejoinder, para 89.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondents contend that, as a result, the Tribunal's treatment of Zimbabwe's objection in the Award, and the alleged lack of application by the Tribunal of Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations, did not have had a material effect on the outcome of the arbitration.105\n\nTr Day 2, 467:12-23\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondents also argue the Applicant failed to raise its Illegality Objection in a timely and diligent manner. In particular, once it had received, on 15 November 2011, the Respondents' Memorial, which detailed the acquisition of their investments, the Applicant could have used the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's system to check whether the Respondents' investments had been granted the required approvals under Zimbabwean law.106 However, the Applicant failed to do so and therefore also failed to challenge the legality of the Respondents' investments at an appropriate time.\n\nRejoinder, paras 31-40; Tr Day 2, 310:6-317:8.\n\n217.\n\nFurthermore, as to Exhibit C-858 [ZA-045], the Respondents submit that the document relates to a transaction that did not involve the VPBs but the subsidiaries of their previous owner, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique.107 The letter also does not contain any undertaking that no change of beneficial ownership would occur in the future; it merely confirms that the specific transaction will not involve any change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the company.108\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 135; Tr Day 2, 367:11-22.\n\nRejoinder, paras 44-45.\n\n218.\n\nFinally, and in any event, the Respondents argue that the letter does not emanate from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and therefore does not imply any binding legal opinion that would engage the exchange control regulations.109 Consequently, even if the Tribunal had failed to consider the letter, which is not the case, it would not have manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the applicable law.110\n\nTr Day 2, 383:14-384:8.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 431-433.\n\n**G. GROUND 7: TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS\u2014ISSUING AN AWARD WITHOUT HAVING JURISDICTION (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal wrongly found jurisdiction over the Respondents' illegal investments. According to the Applicant, under Article 9(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal could only assert jurisdiction over investments that had been made \"in accordance with the laws\" of Zimbabwe.111\n\nTr Day 1, 172:3-10\n\n220.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Respondents' investments were illegal, as they had not been approved by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, as required under Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations.112 The Applicant maintains that it established the illegality of the investments in the arbitration, but the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 9 erroneously dismissed the Applicant's arguments for procedural reasons.\n\n*See above* paragraphs 209-210.\n\n221.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal also mistakenly relied on estoppel to assert jurisdiction over the Respondents' illegal investments.113 The Applicant submits that estoppel and waiver cannot serve as a basis of jurisdiction, as these notions are only relevant to issues of admissibility. The Applicant contends that since jurisdiction trumps admissibility, the Tribunal was wrong in relying on notions of admissibility to uphold jurisdiction.114\n\nTr Day 1, 197:9-198:21.\n\nReply, paras 879-887; Tr Day 1, 265:20-23.\n\n222.\n\nThe Applicant submits that it could not have lodged its jurisdictional challenge based on the illegality of the Respondents' investments earlier in the proceedings.115 It could not have been aware of the illegality of the Respondents' investments before they adduced Exhibit C-858 [ZA-45] into the record.116 The Applicant accordingly could not have waived its right to raise its jurisdictional challenge, and the Tribunal should not have asserted jurisdiction over the Respondents' investments on that basis.117\n\nReply, para 885.\n\nTr Day 1, 197:17-198:21.\n\nReply, paras 913-914.\n\n(2) **The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires that any excess of power, whether as to failure to apply the proper law or excess of jurisdiction,118 must be \"manifest.\" The Respondents contend that, according to the jurisprudence of ICSID annulment committees, an excess of power can only be manifest if it is evident, that is, with only one interpretation being possible on the issue in question.119 In particular, the Respondents assert that if the relevant reasoning of the tribunal is tenable or arguable, there cannot be any \"manifest excess of power.\"120 According to the Respondents, the reasons given by the Tribunal on the Applicant's illegality arguments were evidently tenable and thus cannot result in the annulment of the Award.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 437.\n\nThe Respondents, *inter alia*, refer to the annulment decisions issued in *Alapli Elektrik B.V v Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No ARB/08/13, Decision on Annulment, 10 July 2014 (\"*Alapli v Turkey*\") (**VPBLEX-079**), paras 231-232; *Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment, 28 January 2002 (\"*Wena v Egypt*\") (**ZALEX-044**), para 25; and *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Leon Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/23, Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016 (\"*EDF v Argentina*\") (**VPBLEX-080**), para 192. *See also* Tr Day 2, 469:3-8 (*citing* *CDC Group plc v Repiblic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/14, Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005 (\"*CDC v Seychelles*\") (**VPBLEX-073**), para 41; *Azurix Corp. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Decision on Annulment, 1 September 2009 (**ZALEX-046**), para 68; *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/3, Decision on Annulment, 7 October 2008 (**ZALEX-061**), para 69; *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/25, Decision on Annulment, 23 December 2010 (\"*Fraport v Philippines*\") (**ZALEX-045**), para 112).\n\n*EDF v Argentina* (**VPBLEX-080**), para 193; Tr Day 2, 459:18-460:4.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondents argue that several ICSID annulment committees have drastically limited the scope of review of ICSID tribunals' jurisdictional decisions on annulment.121 The Respondents submit that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires that an excess of jurisdiction be \"obvious, without deeper analysis\" for the annulment committee to annul an ICSID award on this basis.122 However, since the Applicant is effectively requesting the Committee to review the Tribunal's jurisdictional decision *de novo*, its annulment application must fail.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 441-444.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 441; Tr Day 2, 468:23-469:2.\n\n225.\n\nAs to the Applicant's estoppel arguments, the Respondents note that the Applicant relies on the alleged misapplication by the Tribunal of the estoppel principle (*i.e.*, it applied estoppel in relation to jurisdiction rather than admissibility). However, an erroneous application of the law cannot lead to an award's annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.123\n\nRejoinder, para 92.\n\n226.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondents, the Applicant relies on ICSID annulment decisions which do not establish that estoppel cannot vest jurisdiction in an ICSID tribunal.124 Finally, and in any event, the Respondents point out that the Applicant did not put forward the argument regarding the relationship between jurisdiction and admissibility during the arbitration.125 Thus, according to the Respondents, the Applicant is precluded from raising its estoppel arguments in the annulment phase.126\n\nRejoinder, paras 95-105.\n\nTr Day 2, 470:20-471:1.\n\nRejoinder, para 91.\n\n**H. GROUND 8: FAILURE OF THE AWARD TO STATE THE REASONS ON WHICH IT IS BASED (ARTICLE 52(1)(E))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) **The Applicant's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Applicant's eighth ground of annulment is based on the Tribunal's procedural decisions dealing with the Applicant's Illegality Objection. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to consider \"outcome-determinative questions\" relating to the illegality of the VPBs' investments.\n\n228.\n\nFirst, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal, by way of Procedural Order No 9, wrongly excluded the Applicant's submissions and evidence relating to the wider illegality defense\u2014that is, that the VPBs' investments were all illegal for failure to comply with Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations.127 As a result, the Award failed to consider Exhibit C-858 and the related jurisdictional objections.\n\nMemorial, para 608.\n\n229.\n\nSecond, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal contradicted itself by quoting in the Award in full Zimbabwe's corrected statement of relief, even if it had previously excluded it from the record. The Tribunal cannot rely on a document that it has itself decided is not part of the record.128\n\nMemorial, paras 608-609.\n\n230.\n\nAs to the Respondents' argument that the Applicant's eighth ground of annulment is time-barred, the Applicant argues that the elements of its eighth ground \"could reasonably be considered as covered by the statements in the application for annulment\" and therefore are not really new grounds.129\n\nReply, para 917.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondents argue that, as a preliminary matter, the Applicant's eighth ground of annulment is inadmissible as it was not mentioned in the Applicant's Annulment Application. It is therefore time-barred under ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(iii), which requires that an application for annulment must \"state in detail... the grounds on which it is based.\" Therefore, at a minimum, the application must identify the bases under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention which the applicant is invoking.\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention only requires that the reasoning of the challenged award can be followed; it does not require that the reasons be \"appropriate\" or \"convincing.\"130 Nor can an ICSID tribunal be criticized on annulment for not having considered arguments that the parties did not make in the underlying arbitration proceeding.131\n\nTr Day 2, 472:19-474:3.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 489-496; Tr Day 2, 473:17-22.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Applicant's contentions are based on a new, wider iteration of the Illegality Objection which it has only developed during the annulment proceeding. Hence, the Tribunal could not be criticized for having failed to consider an argument which was never made before it.132\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 469.\n\n234.\n\nAs to the Applicant's second argument, the Respondents state that, in quoting the full request for relief in the Award, the Tribunal was not entertaining the Applicant's Illegality Objection that it had already dismissed repeatedly, most notably in Procedural Order No 9.133 Hence, since the relevant requests for relief had already been dismissed previously, there was no need for the Tribunal to address them again in the Award. There is therefore no contradiction in the Tribunal's quoting the full request for relief in the Award.134 In any event, even assuming the Tribunal's reference to the Applicant's full request for relief were to be considered a mistake, it could not lead to the annulment of the Award. According to the Respondents, only reasons which are so contradictory as to cancel each other out can lead to an annulment of an award under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.135\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 478; Rejoinder, paras 280-281.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 483-485; Tr Day 2, 474:4-475:16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 501.\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondents insist that the Tribunal did not fail to consider \"outcome determinative\" questions relating to the Applicant's Illegality Objection. Indeed, these questions were either not pleaded by the Applicant as such in the arbitration, or the objection, as pleaded on annulment by the Applicant, had been dismissed as inadmissible by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 9.136\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 486; Tr Day 2, 476:7-13.\n\n236.\n\nFinally, the Respondents note that since the Tribunal rejected the Illegality Objection in all its forms on the basis of estoppel, the treatment of this objection throughout the arbitration had no material effect on the outcome of the arbitration. In other words, the Respondents contend that, since the Tribunal ruled that the Applicant was estopped from claiming that it did not grant the necessary approval to the Respondents' investments, it would have dismissed any illegality objection based on lack of approval, regardless of the timing of its submission by the Applicant.137\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 510; Rejoinder, paras 284-286.\n\n**V. THE COMMITTEE'S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe legal framework and the legal principles governing ICSID annulment proceedings are well established in the ICSID Convention and in the jurisprudence of ICSID annulment committees. The key provision governing annulment is Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n238.\n\nWhile Article 52 sets out the annulment grounds in abstract terms, their real test therefore being in their application, there is a well-established understanding of the legal basis and the scope of annulment under the ICSID Convention. Thus, the practice of ICSID annulment committees has confirmed that the grounds of annulment listed in Article 52 are exclusive, and that it is the applicant that carries the burden of proof in establishing that any of the annulment grounds it invokes exist.138\n\n*See, e.g.*, *CDC v Seychelles* (**VPBLEX-073**), para 34; *Alapli v Turkey* (**VPBLEX-079**), paras 31-32, 134, 202, 256; *EDF v Argentina* (**VPBLEX-080**), para 132.\n\n239.\n\nIt is also clear from the language of Article 52, and it is well established in ICSID annulment practice, that annulment is an extraordinary remedy and not an appeal from the legal or factual findings of the arbitral tribunal.139 The object and purpose of annulment proceedings is not to test the substantive correctness of the award; indeed, Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention specifically provides that \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\" Annulment can be successful only if there is a fundamental flaw in the award, or in the proceeding that led to it, that falls under one or more of the annulment grounds in Article 52. The function of an ICSID *ad hoc* committee is not to review the factual findings of an ICSID tribunal or its decision on the merits, but to determine whether any of the annulment grounds in Article 52 has been established. Nor is an ICSID annulment proceeding a retrial and accordingly it is based on the record before the tribunal.140 Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), it is the tribunal, and not an ICSID annulment committee, that is the judge of the admissibility of evidence and its probative value.141\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v Government of Guinea*, ICSID Case No ARB/84/4, Decision on Annulment, 14 December 1989 (\"*MINE v Guinea*\") (**ZALEX-043**), para 4.04; *CDC v Seychelles* (**VPBLEX-073**), para 34; *Alapli v Turkey* (**VPBLEX-079**), paras 33 and 234; *EDF v Argentina* (**VPBLEX-080**), paras 64-67, 69 (*quoting* *MTD Equity and MTD Chile v Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/07, Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007 (\"*MTD v Chile*\"), para 31).\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *MTD v Chile*, para 31 (*as quoted in EDF v Argentina* (**VPBLEX-080**), para 64); *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/07, Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, paras 20, 23 (*as quoted in EDF v Argentina* (**VPBLEX-080**), paras 65-66); *Alapli v Turkey* (**VPBLEX-079**), paras 31-33.\n\n*See* *Alapli v. Turkey* (**VPBLEX-079**), para 234.\n\n240.\n\nIt follows from these principles that a party seeking annulment cannot make new arguments on the merits that were not made in the original proceedings, or more generally, try to reargue the case on the merits. Thus, for instance, in *Klockner I,* the *ad hoc* committee noted that an application for annulment cannot be used by a party \"to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments.\"142 Other ICSID annulment committees have made similar observations.143\n\n*Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais SA*, ICSID Case No ARB/81/2, Decision on Annulment (Translation), 3 May 1985 (\"*Klockner I*\") (**ZALEX-078**), para 83.\n\n*See, e.g., Postov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and Istrokapital SE v Hellenic Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/13/8, Decision on Annulment, 29 September 2016 *(\"Postov\u00e1 banka v Greece\")* (**VPBLEX-082**), para 130; *MINE v Guinea* (**ZALEX-043**), para 6.42, *Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira v Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No ARB/04/7, Decision on Annulment (Translation), 10 December 2010 (\"*Vieira v Chile*\") (**VPBLEX-083**), para 237; *Togo Electricit\u00e9 and GDF-Suez Energie Services v Republic of Togo*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/7, Decision on Annulment (Translation), 6 September 2011 (\"*Togo Electricit\u00e9 v Togo*\") (**VPBLEX-084**), para 50.\n\n241.\n\nIn the present case, there appears to be no disagreement between the Parties as to the applicable legal principles, as outlined above. These principles will govern and inform the Committee's determinations, as relevant, as set out in this Section V.\n\n**B. GROUND 1: SERIOUS BREACH OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\u2014DENIAL OF RIGHT TO BE HEARD ON THE ILLEGALITY OBJECTION (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Applicant contends that it was denied the right to be heard on the Illegality Objection as a result of the Tribunal's procedural decisions excluding certain evidence from the record. The Applicant challenges, in particular, the Tribunal's Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9, which excluded substantial parts of its Illegality Objection, refused the Applicant's request for extension of the page limit for its response and ordered the redaction of three witness statements submitted by Zimbabwe. According to the Applicant, these decisions constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and thus justify the annulment of the Award in its entirety.144\n\nThe Applicant also contends, under this annulment ground, that Mr Fortier was biased against Zimbabwe. The Committee considers it more appropriate to address this argument when dealing with the third ground of annulment.\n\n243.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that the right to be heard is a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee agrees, as have agreed other ICSID *ad hoc* committees.145 However, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal committed a serious breach of this rule.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Fraport v Philippines* (**ZALEX-045**), para 197; *Wena v Egypt* (**ZALEX-044**), para 57; *MINE v Guinea* (**ZALEX-043**), para 5.06.\n\n244.\n\nThe Committee has carefully reviewed the procedural history of the arbitration proceeding in order to determine whether the Applicant was denied an opportunity to plead its illegality defense and to present evidence in its support, including, and in particular, as a result of Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9.\n\n245.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal took its decisions in Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9 in the context of protracted proceedings, which resulted in additional pleading rounds beyond the initially envisaged two rounds and in several postponements of the evidentiary hearing. As summarized above, the additional pleading rounds were ordered by the Tribunal, in particular, in order to allow Zimbabwe to raise its Illegality Objection, even though Zimbabwe had initially indicated that it did not intend to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Zimbabwe did not raise any jurisdictional objections in its Counter Memorial, and while it did raise certain jurisdictional and admissibility objections in its Rejoinder, including on the basis that the VPBs' investments allegedly had not been approved as required under Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, it did not challenge the legality of the VPBs' investments. Although filed late under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), the Tribunal admitted all of these objections in Procedural Order No 3, finding that \"special circumstances\" existed, within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), which justified the admission of the objections even if pleaded out of time.\n\n246.\n\nIn its Rebutter dated 19 April 2013, Zimbabwe expanded its Approval Objection under Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and also raised, for the first time, an objection to the legality of the investments under both Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, on the basis that the VPBs had failed to obtain approval from competent Zimbabwean authorities for their investments.146 Although the Tribunal had not scheduled further pleadings beyond Zimbabwe's 19 April 2013 Rebutter, on 4 July 2013, Zimbabwe wrote a letter to the Tribunal raising a wider illegality objection (the \"**Wider Illegality Objection**\"), arguing now that all of the VPBs' investments were in breach of Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations and therefore illegal. On 8 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7, dismissing the VPBs' application not to admit the Illegality Objection raised in the Rebutter, deciding not to admit Zimbabwe's 4 July 2013 letter as an additional pleading, and ordering Zimbabwe instead to file by 16 August 2013 a Re-Rebutter setting out its Illegality Objection under Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe argued in the original arbitration that its illegality objection was an objection to admissibility rather than jurisdiction, it argues now in the annulment proceeding that it was in fact an objection to jurisdiction (*see*, *e.g.*, Memorial, paras 599-606). As explained below, the Committee does not consider that this characterization issue is of any relevance in the present proceeding; the issue is rather whether Zimbabwe was improperly precluded from raising this objection or producing evidence in its support.\n\n247.\n\nZimbabwe filed its Re-Rebutter on 15 August 2013, expanding the scope of its Illegality Objection, but not arguing, at this time, that all of the VPBs' investments were illegal for failure to comply with Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations. In other words, although given the opportunity to clearly set out its Illegality Objection in this pleading, Zimbabwe did not embrace in its Re-Rebutter the Wider Illegality Objection it had raised in its 4 July 2013 letter.\n\n248.\n\nIt was not until 26 September 2013, in its Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter, that Zimbabwe for the first time raised its Wider Illegality Objection in an admissible pleading, alleging that all of the VPBs' investments were in breach of Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations and therefore illegal. Zimbabwe also contended that Exhibit C-858 (which the VPBs had filed with their Response to the Re-Rebutter on 9 September 2013) was not relevant since at the time the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe granted its approval for the transaction reflected in Exhibit C-858, neither party to the transaction was owned or controlled by the VPBs; accordingly the document could not evidence exchange control approval of the VPB's investments.147 This point was subsequently conceded by the VPBs, in a telephone conference hearing held on 11 October 2013 (see below) and in their skeleton argument for the hearing.\n\nLetter from the Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited to Tanks Group Services Limited dated 12 November 1992 (**ZA-045** / C-858 in the original arbitration). *See also* Zimbabwe's Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter dated 26 September 2013 (**VPB-079**), para 26 and Third Witness Statement of Mr Onias Claver Masiwa dated 23 September 2013 (**ZA-047**), paras 4-5.\n\n249.\n\nAfter hearing the Parties by way of a telephone conference on 11 October 2013, the Tribunal on 15 October 2013 issued Procedural Order No 9, excluding, *inter alia*, Zimbabwe's 26 September 2013 pleading insofar as it raised the new Wider Illegality Objection that Zimbabwe had not raised in its 15 August 2013 Re-Rebutter. The Tribunal found that \"[t]his expansion of [Zimbabwe's] jurisdictional objections was done in breach of the Tribunal's Procedural Orders, in particular paragraph 55(i) of PO No 3 and paragraph 62 of PO No 7, as well as Arbitration Rules 31(3) and 41(1).\"148 The Tribunal also found that no special circumstances existed within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3) to warrant the admission of the Wider Illegality Objection at that stage of proceedings.149 The Tribunal also declared inadmissible certain passages in Zimbabwe's witness statements, insofar as they related to the Wider Illegality Objection.\n\nProcedural Order No 9 (**VPB-148**), para 51.\n\nProcedural Order No 9 (**VPB-148**), para 51.\n\n250.\n\nThe Committee notes that the alleged illegality of the VPBs' investments is a preliminary objection on which Zimbabwe had the burden of proof from the very beginning of the arbitration. However, as noted above, Zimbabwe did not raise the Illegality Objection until its Rebutter in April 2013, when it argued that the VPBs' investments were illegal for lack of approval, and in its letter of 4 July 2013, when it for the first time raised the Wider Illegality Objection, to the effect that all of the VPBs' investments were illegal for failure to comply with the exchange control regulations (however, as noted above, the 4 July 2013 letter was not an admissible pleading). It is therefore not correct to state, as the Applicant does, that it was not in a position to raise the Wider Illegality Objection until the VPBs filed Exhibit C-858 on 9 September 2013. Moreover, as summarized above, the Applicant itself did not consider at the time that Exhibit C-858 constituted relevant evidence because when the transaction referred to in C-858 (which showed the approval of the acquisition of Franconian through Saxonian) occurred, the VPBs did not own Saxonian; both companies were owned by their previous owner (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique).150 Consequently, the Applicant's contention that it was not in a position to raise the Wider Illegality Objection (*i.e.*, that all of the VPBs' investments were illegal for failure to comply with Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations) until the VPBs submitted Exhibit C-858, together with its 9 September 2013 Response, has no basis in fact.151\n\nZimbabwe's Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter dated 26 September 2013 (**VPB-079**), p. 9 and Third Witness Statement of Mr Onias Claver Masiwa dated 23 September 2013 (**ZA-047**), paras 4-5.\n\nThe Applicant also cannot argue that it could not determine whether Tanks Limited had the necessary exchange control approvals because it was not aware that Franconian was previously called Tanks Limited, and because it only became aware of this fact when the VPBs filed C-858 (which showed the previous name of Franconian). As pointed out by the Respondents, one of the VPBs' witness statements, filed in support of its Memorial, contained an organogram showing the previous name of Franconian. The Committee does not follow the Applicant's argument that the fact that the name of Tanks Limited was handwritten somehow precluded Zimbabwe from performing the necessary verifications.\n\n251.\n\nIt is well-established that an ICSID annulment proceeding is indeed an annulment proceeding and not an appeal, and it is therefore not a place for a party to raise an argument that it did not make in the underlying arbitration proceeding152\u2014and even less a place to raise an argument that contradicts the argument raised by a party in the arbitration proceeding. Consequently, insofar as the Applicant seeks to argue now, in this annulment proceeding, that Exhibit C-858 constitutes evidence of illegality, it raises a new argument that cannot be considered at this stage of the proceedings, even assuming it were valid (which in any event is not the case, as conceded by Zimbabwe in the arbitration).\n\n*See Klockner I* (**ZALEX-078**), para 83 (\"[A]s a rule an application for annulment cannot serve as a substitute for an appeal against an award and permit criticism of the merits of the judgments rightly or wrongly formulated by the award. Nor can it be used by one party to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments.\"). *See also Postov\u00e1 banka v Greece* (**VPBLEX-082**), para 130; *MINE v Guinea* (**ZALEX-043**), para 6.42; *Vieira v Chile* (**VPBLEX-083**), para 237; *Togo Electricit\u00e9 v Togo* (**VPBLEX-084**), para 50.\n\n252.\n\nThe Applicant now also argues that Exhibit R-087 (a letter from the Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe dated 8 September 1992), in which the Merchant Bank states, on behalf of Tanks Consolidated Investment Limited (the previous name of Franconian), that when Franconian is transferred to Saxonian, \"there will be no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of [Franconian],\"153 records a condition imposed by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe that applied to any future transactions involving Franconian. The Applicant suggests that the subsequent transfer of Franconian to the VPBs breached this condition. This is a new argument not made by Zimbabwe in the arbitration and therefore not relevant in this annulment proceeding; as noted above, a party cannot raise new arguments in ICSID annulment proceedings that it could have raised, but did not raise, in the arbitration proceeding. In any event, the Applicant misreads the letter; the Committee agrees with the Respondents that it is evident from the language and context of the letter that it refers to the 9 December 1992 transaction itself and does not apply to any future transactions. Indeed, the statement is contained in a letter from Tanks Consolidated Investment Limited to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, and not from the latter to the former, so in any event it cannot be read to contain a condition imposed by the Bank.\n\nLetter from MBCA to the Deputy General Manager, Exchange Control Department, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe dated 8 September 1992 (**ZA-049** / R-087 in the original arbitration).\n\n253.\n\nThe Committee is unable to find in the sequence of procedural events summarized above any denial of opportunity for the Applicant to be able to argue its case on illegality, nor any breach of its right to be heard. It is undisputed that Zimbabwe raised its illegality defense, in its narrow form, only in its Rebutter on 19 April 2013. At that point in time, Zimbabwe had already had an opportunity to raise its illegality defense twice, both in its Counter-Memorial and in its Rejoinder. It was only in its 26 September 2013 Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter that Zimbabwe sought to extend its illegality defense, which it had finally raised in its Rebutter in April 2013, to govern all of the VPBs' investments. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the Applicant was denied the opportunity to be heard on its illegality defense. Nor does the Committee agree that the Tribunal acted improperly when issuing Procedural Order No 9, in which it found Zimbabwe's Wider Illegality Objection and the supporting witness evidence to be inadmissible. The Tribunal's decisions were legitimate procedural decisions to protect the due process rights of both Parties in circumstances where one of the Parties continued to raise new preliminary objections out of time, and where the Party in question had already been given an opportunity to raise its new objections even if they were out of time.\n\n254.\n\nThe Committee further notes that, while the Applicant now argues that its Illegality Objection was an objection to jurisdiction, in the arbitration it characterized its objection as an objection to admissibility rather than jurisdiction.154 However, the issue of characterization of the Applicant's objection has no bearing on the Committee's determination as to whether or not there has been a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. While under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) an ICSID tribunal \"may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence,\" the burden of proof remains with the party raising a preliminary objection, whether based on jurisdiction or admissibility. Indeed, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 (\"Preliminary Objections\"), which requires that preliminary objections \"be made as early as possible\" and be filed \"no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the countermemorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder,\" covers all preliminary objections, including those to \"competence,\" and not only objections to jurisdiction. While the provision makes an exception for situations in which \"the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time,\" the Tribunal did allow Zimbabwe to raise its Illegality Objection late, after the completion of the first two rounds of pleadings. Moreover, and in any event, Exhibit C-858 (which the Applicant argues constituted new evidence relevant to illegality) cannot be considered to evidence a new fact which was unknown to Zimbabwe at the time; as noted above, both Parties agreed in the arbitration that it was not relevant evidence as it did not relate to a transaction entered into by the VPBs.155\n\n*See* Award (**VPB-174**), paras 344, 346.\n\nIt is also evident from the record that, based on the information in Appendix 1 filed with VPBs' Memorial, Zimbabwe would have been able to verify whether the required exchange control regulations, if any, had been provided to all of the VPBs' investments.\n\n255.\n\nAn ICSID tribunal's task is to provide a party with a reasonable opportunity to be heard; there is no right to an unlimited opportunity to be heard. It is for the party concerned to take advantage of that opportunity, when provided. In the present case, the Tribunal did provide the Applicant with a reasonable opportunity, and indeed several opportunities, to be heard on its Illegality Objection, and accordingly there was no denial of the right to be heard and therefore no breach of a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n256.\n\nFinally, as to Zimbabwe's argument that the Tribunal denied Zimbabwe's right to be heard, thus committing a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure, when dismissing in Procedural Order No 8 Zimbabwe's request for a page extension of its 26 September 2013 pleading by three to four pages, the Committee is unable to see in such a routine procedural decision any denial of the right to be heard, in particular as the new matters raised by the VPBs in their 9 September 2013 submission were responsive to Zimbabwe's Re-Rebutter and accordingly the page extension was not justified in the first place.\n\n257.\n\nThe Applicant's first ground of annulment is therefore dismissed.\n\n**C. GROUND 2: SERIOUS BREACH OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\u2014DENIAL OF RIGHT TO BE HEARD AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE PRESIDENT'S DISCLOSURE (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Applicant argues that Mr Yves Fortier, the President of the Tribunal, failed to timely disclose his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board, which he had held since May 2012. Mr Fortier mentioned his position during the hearing, on 31 October 2013, when inquiring whether either Party would have any issue if the Secretary of the Sanctions Board were to attend the hearing on that day. According to the Applicant, it was too late at that point in time, when the proceedings had already reached the hearing stage, to seek disqualification. As result, the late disclosure deprived the Applicant of the right to be heard in the matter, which allegedly constitutes a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondents note that the World Bank Sanctions Board has no power to pronounce sanctions against States and accordingly its sanctioning powers are irrelevant in this proceeding. According to the Respondents, Mr Fortier is not an official of the World Bank and when chairing the Sanctions Board\u2014he acts independently, just as he acted independently when chairing the Tribunal. Consequently, Mr Fortier's function as a chairperson of the Sanctions Board was not a disclosable matter, and even if it had been, Zimbabwe had ample time to challenge him\u2014until 3 February 2015, when the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, the Applicant has therefore waived its right to challenge Mr Fortier's alleged lack of impartiality.\n\n260.\n\nThe Committee need not, in this annulment proceeding, take a view on whether Mr Fortier's position as a chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board constitutes a valid basis for disqualification, or whether any disqualification application by Zimbabwe would have been successful. The Committee merely notes, as the issue has been debated by the Parties in this annulment proceeding, that the Sanctions Board is tasked with sanctioning companies and individuals suspected of having engaged in misconduct and recommending sanctions to the World Bank President, to protect the integrity of World Bank's operations and to ensure that development financing is used only for its intended purpose. The Sanctions Board has no jurisdiction to impose sanctions on States, and it is undisputed that the Sanctions Board has not imposed sanctions in connection with any World Bank operations involving Zimbabwe. The Applicant's case appears rather to be that any position involving sanctioning powers or authority to impose sanctions of any kind is incompatible with the function of the president of an ICSID tribunal in the present case, given that Zimbabwe has been a target of international sanctions since the early 2000s.156 This is a broad proposition, and certainly not one that Zimbabwe has demonstrated would create a *prima facie* basis for disqualification. Be that as it may, Zimbabwe never made any application to disqualify Mr Fortier, so the proposition that Zimbabwe now advances was never assessed as part of the arbitration proceeding.\n\n*See* Tr Day 1, 64:24-69:24.\n\n261.\n\nAs to the Applicant's argument that Mr Fortier's late disclosure deprived it of the opportunity to challenge him, the Committee notes that under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) \"[a] party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.\"157 In the present case, as the Applicant became aware of the alleged basis for disqualification during the hearing, it could have brought an application for disqualification at any time between the end of the hearing, which occurred on 2 November 2013, and 3 February 2015, the date when the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed. The Committee is unable to agree that a proposal for disqualification at that stage of the proceedings would have been futile as the Tribunal had not yet rendered its award.\n\nAccording to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, a party may propose disqualification of a member of an ICSID tribunal \"on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" According to Article 14(1), one of the qualities required is that the person in question \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n262.\n\nConsequently, in view of its failure to propose disqualification promptly, as soon as it became aware of the alleged basis of disqualification, the Applicant must be considered to have waived its right to challenge Mr Fortier, in accordance with Rule 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. According to Rule 27, a party which knows that a provision of the Rules has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections, \"shall be deemed... to have waived its right to object.\"158 Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Applicant was deprived of the opportunity to challenge the President of the Tribunal and that, as a result, it was denied the right to be heard.\n\nThe provision is subject to Article 45 of the ICSID Convention (\"Failure to Appear\"), which however does not apply in the present case.\n\n263.\n\nThe Applicant's second ground of annulment therefore stands to be dismissed.\n\n**D. GROUND 3: TRIBUNAL NOT PROPERLY CONSTITUTED\u2014LACK OF IMPARTIALITY OF PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL (ARTICLE 52(1)(A))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThe Applicant's third ground of annulment is based on the same alleged facts as the second ground\u2014Mr Fortier's involvement with the World Bank Sanctions Board, which according to the Applicant was incompatible with his function as President of the Tribunal. According to the Applicant, Mr Fortier not only was perceived as being partial as a result of his function; he also acted *de facto* in a partial manner, in particular during the hearing. According to the Applicant, this calls for annulment of the Award on the basis that the Tribunal was not properly constituted under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondents argue that Zimbabwe could have invoked Article 57 of the Convention and accordingly could have proposed the disqualification of Mr Fortier at any time after the date when it became aware of the alleged manifest lack of impartiality, until the closure of the proceedings on 3 February 2015; however, it failed to do so. Having thus failed to comply with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1), which requires a party to raise its proposal for disqualification \"promptly,\" the Applicant must be deemed to have waived its right to challenge, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.\n\n266.\n\nThe Committee agrees that ICSID Arbitration Rules 9(1) and 27 are indeed the relevant provisions in this context. Consequently, insofar as the Applicant relies in support of its application on the mere fact of Mr Fortier's function as chairperson of the Sanctions Board (said to be incompatible with his function as President of the Tribunal), the annulment application stands to be dismissed on the same basis as the Applicant's second ground of annulment\u2014the Applicant must be considered to have waived its right to seek disqualification under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.\n\n267.\n\nThe Committee also fails to see in Mr Fortier's conduct during the arbitration proceedings, including the hearing, any evidence of lack of impartiality. First, to the extent that the Applicant relies on the decisions taken by the Tribunal which dismissed Zimbabwe's position in the arbitration or were otherwise incompatible with its pleaded position, as evidence of alleged lack of impartiality, such decisions, without more, are insufficient to establish the Applicant's case. Indeed, it is the very function of an ICSID tribunal to resolve disputes, that is, to decide which party is right and which party is wrong on any disputed issue, and such decisions, which are a necessary element of the dispute resolution function, cannot, without more, constitute evidence of partiality. Second, all the decisions taken by the Tribunal, including those referred to by the Applicant, were unanimous; in the one instance where Mr Fortier acted alone, this was because the matter was urgent, and the Parties had previously agreed that in such a situation the President was indeed authorized to act without consulting his co-Arbitrators.159 Moreover, that decision was not disputed by Zimbabwe at the time.\n\n*See* Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session of the two Arbitral Tribunals dated 7 February 2011 (**ZA-071**).\n\n268.\n\nNor is the Committee able to find evidence of partiality in the President's conduct during the hearing; indeed, the Applicant confirmed at the end of the hearing that it had had its day in court and had been treated fairly.160\n\nOriginal Arbitration Final Hearing Transcript of Day 6 dated 2 November 2013 (**VPB-173a**), 1880:8-14.\n\n269.\n\nIn view of the above, the Applicant's third ground of annulment is to be dismissed.\n\n**E. GROUND 4: SERIOUS BREACH OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\u2014DENIAL OF RIGHT TO BE HEARD AS A RESULT OF FAILURE TO DISCLOSE (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Applicant's fourth ground of annulment is based essentially on the same issue as its second and third grounds of annulment\u2014Mr Fortier's role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board. While both the second and the fourth ground rely on the same legal argument\u2014alleged serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure\u2014they differ as to their factual basis: the second ground focuses on the (informal and late) manner in which the disclosure was made, whereas the fourth ground relies on the alleged failure to disclose. On the other hand, the third and the fourth ground of annulment are based on the same facts, but their legal basis is different\u2014the third ground relies on the alleged improper constitution of the Tribunal, whereas the fourth ground is founded on an alleged serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n271.\n\nUnder its fourth ground of annulment, the Applicant argues that Mr Fortier withheld information about his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board for 548 days after his appointment and did not disclose it until two days before the end of the hearing. According to the Applicant, this constitutes a failure to disclose, which amounts to a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. The Award therefore must be annulled.\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondents argue that there was nothing significant to be disclosed, and that in any event, a duty to disclose is not a fundamental rule of procedure. Moreover, Zimbabwe waived its right to challenge the Award on this basis as it failed to challenge Mr Fortier during the arbitration. According to the Respondents, even assuming the duty to disclose constituted a fundamental rule of procedure, which the Respondents deny, there was no serious breach of the rule since in the absence of any evidence of lack of impartiality, the failure to disclose had no impact on the outcome of the proceedings.\n\n273.\n\nThe Committee notes that, even assuming Mr Fortier had an obligation to disclose (an issue on which the Committee need not take a view, in view of its finding below), Mr Fortier did in fact disclose his function as chairperson of the Sanctions Board during the arbitration. As determined in Section C) above, in connection with the Applicant's second ground of annulment, the Applicant was in fact not deprived of an opportunity to be heard, as it still had ample time to propose disqualification during the period from Mr Fortier's statement at the hearing until the closure of the proceedings, which occurred more than a year later. The Applicant had an opportunity to be heard, but it did not use that opportunity.\n\n274.\n\nAccordingly, the Applicant was not denied the right to be heard and its fourth ground of annulment must be dismissed.\n\n**F. GROUND 5: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS\u2014FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW TO THE NECESSITY DEFENSE (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal applied customary international law and Zimbabwean law when deciding on the Applicant's necessity defense and thus failed to apply the relevant provisions of the BITs\u2014Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 7(1) and 7(2)(b) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT. The Tribunal thus failed to apply the applicable law and thus exceeded its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n276.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, its application is timely as it only learned about the Tribunal's failure to apply the proper law when reviewing the Award.\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Tribunal did apply the applicable international law when determining Zimbabwe's necessity defense and made clear that they did not apply Zimbabwean law. The Respondents further note that Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT does not deal with necessity, and Zimbabwe never invoked Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT before the annulment proceedings.\n\n278.\n\nThe Committee notes that Zimbabwe raised its necessity defense in the arbitration proceedings primarily in terms of Article 25 of the ILC Articles, and that the Tribunal devoted a significant part of the Award to this issue.161 Having analyzed the issue extensively, the Tribunal eventually dismissed the defense, concluding that Zimbabwe had not satisfied the requirements of Article 25. Consequently, the Tribunal did apply international law rather than Zimbabwean law when determining Zimbabwe's necessity defense. As noted above, the Tribunal also specifically addressed Zimbabwe's defense based on Ad Article 3(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, dismissing it.162 While the Tribunal did not specifically address Article 7(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, this provision only provides for national treatment and MFN treatment in relation to restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement of claims in the context of \"war, other armed conflict, revolution, a state of emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot,\" and accordingly does not contain any general necessity defense. Moreover, as noted by the Respondents, Zimbabwe never specifically invoked Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT in the arbitration,163 and in any event, Article 7(2) also does not provide for a necessity defense; it merely refers to necessity as an exception to the obligation to restitute or compensate for destruction of property in the circumstances referred to in Article 7(1).\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), paras 610-668.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 560.\n\n*See* Zimbabwe's Rebutter dated 19 April 2013 (**VPB-074**), para 718.\n\n279.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable law and the Applicant's fifth ground of annulment fails.\n\n**G. GROUND 6: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS\u2014FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW TO THE ILLEGALITY DEFENSE (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Applicant's sixth ground of annulment is based on the argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable Zimbabwean law, specifically Zimbabwe's exchange control regulations, when determining the legality of the VPBs' investments. The Applicant's argument relies on the premise that the Tribunal improperly excluded the Applicant's Wider Illegality Argument and the supporting evidence.\n\n281.\n\nThe Committee has rejected the Applicant's Wider Illegality Argument (above in Section B), when addressing the Applicant's first ground annulment, and it follows that the Applicant's sixth ground of annulment also fails. The Applicant never raised the Wider Illegality Argument in an admissible pleading and therefore cannot rely on it as a basis for an annulment application to argue that the Tribunal failed to apply the law applicable to its illegality argument.\n\n282.\n\nThe Applicant's sixth ground of annulment is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**H. GROUND 7: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS\u2014NO JURISDICTION AS THE RESPONDENTS' INVESTMENTS WERE ILLEGAL (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal wrongly characterized its illegality defense as an objection to admissibility rather than jurisdiction and therefore manifestly exceeded its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. According to the Applicant, jurisdiction is dominant over admissibility as it relates to the State's consent to arbitrate and also cannot be created by way of estoppel.\n\n284.\n\nThe Committee notes that, in the arbitration, Zimbabwe raised its objections regarding the legality of the VPBs' investments and their approval as objections to admissibility rather than jurisdiction (while noting that jurisdiction and admissibility are often considered together). The Tribunal determined to treat Zimbabwe's illegality objections as objections to admissibility, \"consistent with how they have been presented by [Zimbabwe] in the majority of its pleadings,\"164 adding that \"the characterization of these arguments as either jurisdictional or relating to admissibility, in these cases, is immaterial.\"165\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 346.\n\nAward (**VPB-174**), para 346 (The sentence continues \".save as to whether the [VPBs] are entitled to raise their MFN defence,\" which the Tribunal however did not find necessary to consider).\n\n285.\n\nAs the Committee noted above, a party seeking annulment of an ICSID award cannot raise new arguments in an annulment proceeding that it did not raise in the underlying arbitration proceedings. As stressed by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Klockner I,* an application for annulment cannot be used \"to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments.\"166\n\n*Klockner I* (**ZALEX-078**), para 83. *See also Postov\u00e1 banka v Greece* (**VPBLEX-082**), para 130; *MINE v Guinea* (**ZALEX-043**), para 6.42, *Vieira v Chile* (**VPBLEX-083**), para 237; *Togo Electricit\u00e9 v Togo* (**VPBLEX-084**), para 50.\n\n286.\n\nIn any event, even assuming that the Tribunal should have characterized Zimbabwe's objection (contrary to its pleading) as an objection to jurisdiction rather than admissibility, the Applicant has failed to show or indeed even argue that this would have resulted in a different outcome, or that the alleged excess of jurisdiction was manifest, as required by Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n287.\n\nThe Applicant's seventh annulment ground is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**I. GROUND 8: FAILURE TO STATE REASONS\u2014THE APPLICANT'S ILLEGALITY ARGUMENT WAS NOT CONSIDERED (ARTICLE 52(1)(E))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Applicant's eighth ground of annulment is based on Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, which provides for annulment if \"the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"\n\n289.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondents argue that, insofar as the Applicant relies on Article 52(1)(e), its Annulment Application is time-barred and as such inadmissible as it did not mention Article 52(1)(e) at all in its Annulment Application dated 21 October 2015. This particular ground for annulment was introduced by the Applicant only on 7 June 2017, when it filed its Amended and Restated Annulment Application, together with its Memorial on Annulment. According to the Respondents, this conclusion is not affected by the fact that the original Annulment Application did mention the matters that the Applicant now raises in support of its eighth annulment ground, as these matters were raised only in support of other annulment grounds.\n\n290.\n\nThe Applicant argues, in response, that the Respondents' position is \"formalistic\" and refers, in support, to the *Amco I* decision, in which the *ad hoc* committee considered whether the application for annulment should contain more than just a reference to the grounds in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and went on to examine whether the annulment grounds in question could be reasonably be considered as being covered by the statements in the annulment application. According to the Applicant, \"the elements of Ground 8 could reasonably be considered as covered by the statements in the [A]pplication for [A]nnulment\" as they \"were in fact referred to in the Application or reasonably implicit in the Application.\"167 The Applicant also refers to the *Wena v Egypt* and *Klockner II* annulment decisions, which, according to the Applicant, adopted a similar approach. The Applicant suggests that \"there is no harm to VPB as it had the issues if not yet [in] the final form and as it has not needed not [ *sic* ] respond to [the Annulment Application] before its [Counter-Memorial].\"168\n\nReply, para 917.\n\nReply, para 921.\n\n291.\n\nThe Committee recalls that under Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention, annulment may be requested on one or more of the grounds set out in Article 52(1), and that the application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered (with the exception of the ground of corruption, which is not relevant in this case). Furthermore, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(iii), an application for annulment must \"state in detail. the grounds on which it is based.\" The issue in the present case is whether the applicant can omit mentioning the specific annulment ground that it invokes, and whether it is sufficient to simply mention the specific reasons, or substantive grounds, for annulment, albeit under a different legal annulment ground, without invoking the annulment ground itself.\n\n292.\n\nThe Committee notes that in all of the three other cases cited by the Applicant in support of its position\u2014 *Amco I*, *Klockner II* and *Wena v Egypt* \u2014the issue was whether it is sufficient to merely refer to the legal annulment ground in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, or whether the applicant should also \"detail\" the reasons, or the substantive grounds on which its application is based and, if so, on what level of \"detail.\" The issue in the three cases was therefore the opposite to the one in the present case, where the Applicant suggests that it only needs to set out the reasons but need not mention the legal annulment ground itself.\n\n293.\n\nThus, in *Amco I*, the *ad hoc* committee characterized the issue before it in the following terms:\n\n*It appears to the ad hoc Committee that Arbitration Rule 50(i)(c) is not adequately complied with by an Application for annulment which merely recites verbatim the specific subparagraph(s) of Article 52(1) of the Convention being invoked by the applicant. The thrust of Arbitration Rule 50 is not successfully avoided by coupling a recital of the subparagraphs invoked with a general reservation of a \"right to supplement (a) presentation [of Indonesia's claims] with further written submissions.\"*169\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development, Ltd and PT Amco Indonesia v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment, 16 May 1986 (\"*Amco I*\"), available in: 1 ICSID Reports 509 (1993) (**ZALEX-214**), para 46. The *ad hoc* committee went on to find that the grounds invoked by Amco \"are not really new grounds raised for the first time by Indonesia in its Memorial but were either in fact referred to in the Application or reasonably implicit in the Application\" (*Amco I* (**ZALEX-214**), para 53).\n\n294.\n\nSimilarly, in *Klockner II,* the *ad hoc* committee addressed Klockner's argument that Cameroon's annulment application was inadmissible because it did \"not state any reason which could justify the annulment on the basis of any of these three grounds [invoked by Cameroon in its application].\"170 The *ad hoc* committee noted that \"[t]he Washington Convention, in Article 52 and other provisions, does not require an application for annulment to be reasoned 'in detail,'\"171 and concluded that \"it is incumbent upon the Committee, seized with an annulment application, to determine whether the claims submitted by the applicant can be considered as included within or covered by the grounds on which the application is founded.\"172\n\n*Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais*, ICSID Case No ARB/81/2 (Resubmission), Decision on Annulment, 17 May 1990 (\"*Klockner II*\") available in 14 ICSID Reports 101 (2009), para 4.02.\n\n*Klockner II*, para 4.23.\n\n*Klockner II*, para 4.43.\n\n295.\n\nIn *Wena v Egypt*, the respondent (Wena) argued that \"several grounds for annulment were time-barred, by the fact that they had not been argued in the initial Request, but only later in the Applicant's Memorial requesting annulment.\"173 Noting that Wena had \"admitted [\u2026] that these arguments do not exceed the scope of the grounds for annulment initially invoked,\" the *ad hoc* committee concluded that \"[t]he ICSID Convention [\u2026] does not preclude raising new arguments which are related to a ground of annulment invoked within the time limit fixed in the Convention.\"174\n\n*Wena v Egypt* (**ZALEX-044**), para 19.\n\n*Wena v Egypt* (**ZALEX-044**), para 19.\n\n296.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the Committee need not take a view on how detailed the reasons, or the substantive grounds, for the application should be as this is not the issue before it. The Applicant has failed on the threshold issue of having failed to refer to Article 52(1)(e) in support of its Application in the first place.\n\n297.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Applicant's eighth ground for annulment is time-barred and as such inadmissible.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. THE APPLICANT'S COST SUBMISSION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nThe Applicant submits that ICSID administrative costs should be borne equally by the Parties, regardless of the outcome of the two annulment phases. As to the Parties' legal fees and costs, the Applicant argues that each Party should bear its own costs.175\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, paras 9-10.\n\n299.\n\nThe Applicant states that its position is consistent with Article 10(6) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT176 and Article 11(6) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT177 which should be considered by the Committees as representing the Parties' agreement on these issues within the meaning of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.178\n\nArticle 10(6) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT reads, in part: \"Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member and of its representatives at the arbitration proceedings. The cost of the chair[person] and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may make a different decision concerning costs. In all other respect, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure\" (**VPBLEX-021**).\n\nArticle 11(6) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT reads: \"Each Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chair[person] and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Parties\" (**VPBLEX-023**).\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para 15.\n\n300.\n\nThe Applicant states that it has made advance payments to ICSID in the total amount of US$ 900,000 (US$ 450,000 for each case), and that it has incurred \u20ac 986,687.50 in legal fees and \u20ac 36,191.17 in disbursements to its legal counsel, as well as expenses in the amount of US$ 208,100 in connection with the travel of Zimbabwe's delegation to Paris, France, for work sessions with counsel and to attend the two hearings.179\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, paras 2-3, 5-6.\n\n301.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, an analysis of the Parties' procedural conduct during both the arbitration and the annulment proceedings supports its submission that each Party be held liable for half of the ICSID administrative fees and for the full amount of its own legal fees and costs. In particular, the Applicant insists that both Parties contributed to delays in the arbitration,180 and the VPBs withheld evidence, in particular Exhibit C-858, which increased the inefficiency of the proceedings.181 The Applicant has also \"acted in an efficient, professional and courteous manner throughout the pendency of the annulment proceeding.\"182\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, paras 17-30.\n\nApplicant's Reply Submission on Costs, paras 17, 23-30.\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para 32.\n\n302.\n\nFinally, and in any event, the Applicant argues that ICSID tribunals most often decide in favor of each party bearing its own costs.183 In addition, the Applicant highlights that the Respondents' legal fees total more than twice those claimed by the Applicant and are unreasonable. They should be borne solely by the Respondents.184\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, paras 31-48; Applicant's Reply Submission on Costs, para 18.\n\nApplicant's Reply Submission on Costs, para 17.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENTS' COST SUBMISSION**\n---------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Respondents disagree with the Applicant's position that both applicable BITs contain provisions dealing with the apportionment of arbitration costs and legal fees. Indeed, the provisions referred to by the Applicant (Article 10(6) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 11(6) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT) only apply in State-to-State arbitration, and thus should be ignored by the Committee.185 According to the Respondents, the provisions which do address investor-State arbitration in the BITs are silent on the apportionment of arbitration costs and legal fees.186\n\nRespondents' Reply Submission on Costs, para 2.\n\nRespondents' Reply Submission on Costs, para 2.\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Committees should apply the \"costs follow the event\" principle. The Respondents contend that, should the Committees fully reject the Applicant's annulment application, in accordance with the practice of ICSID annulment committees, the Applicant should also be ordered to bear all of the ICSID administrative costs (according to the current trend in annulment decisions).187\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 10.\n\n305.\n\nAs to legal costs (*i.e.*, the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with annulment proceedings, including legal fees), the Respondents note that two apportionment approaches have been generally followed by ICSID annulment committees: (i) the \"costs follow the event\" approach;188 and (ii) each party bears its own costs, unless the annulment application fundamentally lacks merit or a different allocation is warranted in light of the parties' conduct.189 The Respondents submit that, while in their view the former approach is preferable, in this case both approaches should lead the Committee to shift (if not fully at least in part)190 the burden of the Respondents' costs on to the Applicant, notably because the Applicant's application was fundamentally lacking in merit, and because of its conduct in the course of the annulment proceeding, in particular its failure to establish an escrow account for payment of the Award and the manner and tone of presentation in its pleadings.191\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, paras 12-16 and 22.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, paras 18-19 and 24-37.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 38. The Respondents argue that if they do not succeed in the annulment phase, the Applicant's conduct should lead the Committee to order the Applicant to bear all of the arbitration costs, \"to pay at least 50% of the [Respondents'] legal costs, and to bear its own legal costs.\"\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, paras 19, 26-28, 30-33.\n\n306.\n\nWhile the Respondents dispute that they were responsible for any of the delay in the arbitration proceedings, they point out that the conduct of the Parties in the arbitration proceeding is irrelevant to the determination of costs in this annulment proceeding.192 The Respondents also deny that they were responsible for any inefficiency of the arbitration proceedings and reiterate that they did not withhold Exhibit C-858, which in any event was irrelevant to the arbitration proceeding, as agreed by both Parties at the time.\n\nRespondents' Reply Submission on Costs, paras 4-7.\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondents request that the Committee order the Applicant to reimburse all of their legal costs which amount to \u00a3 2.55 million (consisting of a fixed fee of \u00a3 450,000 plus a success fee of \u00a3 2.1 million in respect of Steptoe's fees) plus US$ 240,000 (consisting of a fixed fee of US$ 60,000 plus a success fee of US$ 180,000) in respect of Mr Verrill's fees.193 Likewise, the Respondents request that the Committee order the Applicant to pay their disbursements, which they assess as amounting to \u00a3 22,756.81, US$ 25,945.58 and \u20ac 2,150.194 The Respondents' total legal fees (including success fees) and disbursements amount to \u00a3 2,572,765.81, US$ 265,945.58 and \u20ac 2,150.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, paras 42-45.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, paras 46-48.\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondents state that the von Pezold Claimants have borne the legal costs associated with these annulment proceedings and accordingly the Respondents have apportioned their costs and fees between the two annulment proceedings such that the von Pezold Claimants seek an order in ICSID Case No ARB/10/15 for the entirety of their costs and fees and the Border Claimants do not seek a cost order in ICSID Case No ARB/10/25. The Respondents also request that the Applicant be ordered to pay interest on costs at the interest rate adopted in the Award, *i.e.*, the six-month US$ LIBOR rate plus 2%, compounded every six months from the date of the Committee's decision on the Annulment Application to the date of full payment.195\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 61.\n\n309.\n\nFinally, the Respondents assert that their legal costs are reasonable given, *inter alia*, (i) the importance of the matter to the Parties and the value of the assets involved;196 (ii) the amount and extent of factual and expert evidence;197 (iii) the conduct of the Parties during the proceedings;198 (iv) the time spent and the complexity of the case;199 and (v) the fact that the legal costs have already been paid or, as to the success fee component, are contractually required to be paid (which, to the Respondents, is a strong indication that they are reasonable).200\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 51.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 52.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 53; Respondents' Reply Submission on Costs, paras 4-7.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 55.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, para 56.\n\n**C. THE COMMITTEE'S DECISION ON COSTS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nAccording to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the Convention, titled the \"Cost of the Proceeding,\" \"shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\" In this connection, the relevant provision of Chapter VI is Article 61(2), which provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n311.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 53 further provides that the provisions of the Rules \"shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to [\u2026] annulment of an award and to the decision of the [...] Committee.\" Rule 47 further specifies that \"the [decision of a Committee] shall be in writing and shall contain [...] any decision of the [Committee] regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n312.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), the Applicant made the advance payments requested by the ICSID Secretariat to cover the costs of the annulment proceedings, which include the costs and expenses of the Centre and the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee. These costs (the \"**Costs of the Proceeding**\") amount to US$ 359,711.12 and are broken down as follows:\n\nCommittee's fees and expenses:\n\nDr Veijo Heiskanen US$ 84,831.95\n\nMs Jean Kalicki US$ 53,671.89\n\nProf Azzedine Kettani US$ 70,037.83\n\nICSID's administrative fees US$ 106,000.00\n\nOther disbursements201 US$ 45,169.45\n\nTotal US$ 359,711.12\n\nThis amount includes actual charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision (courier, printing and copying).\n\n313.\n\nThe Costs of the Proceeding have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicant pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).202\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.\n\n314.\n\nThe Applicant's Annulment Application has been dismissed in its entirety. In the circumstances, the Committee considers that it is appropriate that the costs follow the event as to the Costs of the Proceeding as well as the Respondents' legal costs, although not in their entirety as to the latter, in view of the relatively large discrepancy between the costs incurred by the Parties. In the absence of any risk of double compensation for the costs claims of the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants, the Committee accepts the apportionment of costs as agreed between the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants. Accordingly, the Committee decides, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, that the Applicant shall bear the Costs of the Proceeding as well as its own costs and that it shall, within sixty days of the date of this decision, reimburse 50% of the Respondents' legal costs in the amount of \u00a3 1,286,382.90, US$ 132,972.79 and \u20ac 1,075.\n\n315.\n\nThe Committee also finds it appropriate that, if no payment is made within the stipulated sixty-day period, the Applicant be ordered to pay interest on the outstanding amount at the rate provided in paragraph 1024 of the Award, *i.e.*, US$ LIBOR rate plus 2% compounded every six months, from the sixtieth day of the date of this Decision until the date of full payment.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n316.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Application for Annulment of the Award of 28 July 2015 is dismissed in its entirety;\n\n(2) The Committee's directions in Procedural Order No 3 regarding the appointment of the escrow agent and the operation of the escrow accounts lapse upon the issuance of this Decision;\n\n(3) The Applicant shall bear in full the costs incurred by ICSID in these annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* Committee, in the amount of US$ 359,711.12;\n\n(4) The Applicant shall reimburse the Respondents for 50% of their legal costs and expenses, in the amount of \u00a3 1,286,382.90, US$ 132,972.79 and \u20ac 1,075, within sixty days of the date of dispatch of this Decision; and\n\n(5) If no full payment is made in accordance with sub-paragraph (4) above within the sixty-day period, the amount payable is to be increased by interest on the outstanding amount until full payment at the rate provided in paragraph 1024 of the Award."}]}
