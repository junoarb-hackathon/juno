PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 11, 2006, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received from Joseph Charles Lemire (\"Mr. Lemire\" or \"Claimant\"), a citizen of the United States, a request for arbitration (the \"Request\") dated September 6, 2006, against Ukraine (\"Respondent\").\n\n2.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\") acknowledged receipt of the Request and on the same day transmitted a copy thereof to Ukraine with a copy to its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nThe Request, as supplemented by Claimant\u2019s letter of November 14, 2006, was registered by the Centre on December 8, 2006, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. By letter of the same day, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rules 6 and 7 of the Institution Rules, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n4.\n\nThe parties not having reached agreement on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment more than 60 days after the registration of the Request, Claimant invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention by letter of February 8, 2007. Article 37(2)(b) prescribes a Tribunal consisting of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 22, 2007, Claimant appointed Mr. Jan Paulsson of France as arbitrator and on March 7, 2007, Respondent appointed Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss of Germany as arbitrator, each of whom the parties had also appointed in the earlier concluded ICSID Additional Facility case *Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/l).\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal not having been constituted 90 days after the registration of the request, Claimant requested by letters of March 9, 2007, and March 20, 2007, that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(1).\n\n7.\n\nOn June 6, 2007, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, in consultation with the parties, designated Professor Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a national of Spain, as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Secretary-General of ICSID, by letter of June 14, 2007, informed the parties that a Tribunal consisting of Professor Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, Mr. Jan Paulsson and Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss, had been constituted and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1).\n\n9.\n\nAt the time of the filing of the Request, Claimant was represented by the law firm of Salans. From December 2008 to December 2009, Claimant was represented by the law firm of Derains Gharavi & Lazareff in Paris, France, and, subsequently, by the law firm of Derains & Gharavi.\n\n10.\n\nBy letters of June 25, 2007 and July 9, 2007, Respondent notified the Centre of the appointment of the law firm of White & Case LLP in Paris, France, and of the law firm of Magisters in Kyiv, Ukraine, as its legal representatives in this matter.\n\n11.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held on July 23, 2007, at the World Bank\u2019s offices in Paris, and various aspects of procedure were determined at the session. Present at the session were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\nProf. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, *President*Mr. Jan Paulsson, *Arbitrator*Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss, *Arbitrator*\n\nSecretary of the Tribunal\n\nMr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu *(by video conference)*\n\nAttending for Claimant\n\nMr. Joseph C.

The proposal for disqualification of Mr. Paulsson was dismissed and the suspension of the proceeding was lifted as of the date of the notification. The reasoned Decision on Respondent\u2019s proposal for the disqualification was communicated to the parties on September 29, 2008.\n\n24.\n\nOn October 22, 2008, Claimant withdrew the request for provisional measures of August 15, 2008.\n\n25.\n\nOn November 6, 2008, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n26.\n\nOn November 13 and November 18, 2008, Claimant filed requests for production of witnesses, and on November 14, 2008, the parties filed witness statements.\n\n27.\n\nOn November 19, 2009, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference by telephone with the parties.\n\n28.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, Respondent filed observations on Claimant\u2019s requests of November 13 and 18, 2008, for production of witnesses.\n\n29.\n\nOn December 1, 2008, the parties filed rebuttal witness statements and on December 3, 2008, the President of the Tribunal held a further pre-hearing conference by telephone with the parties.\n\n30.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held from December 8, 2008 to December 12, 2008, at the at the World Bank\u2019s offices in Paris.

BASIC FACTS**\n-------------------\n\n33.\n\nThis dispute was submitted to ICSID by Claimant against Respondent under (1) the Treaty between the United States of America and Ukraine Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, done in Kyiv on October 17, 1996 (the \"BIT\") and (2) an agreement between Claimant and Respondent on the settlement of a dispute, dated March 20, 2000 (the \"Settlement Agreement\"), which was recorded as an award on agreed terms on September 18, 2000 (ICSID No. ARB (AF) 98/1 (the \"2000 Award\").\n\n34.\n\nArticle VI of the BIT entitles any national of a State party to the BIT to submit to ICSID any dispute with the other State party to the BIT relating to either *\"an investment agreement between that Party and such national\"* or *\"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\".*\n\n35.\n\nOn November 14, 1997, Claimant filed with ICSID a first arbitration request (the \"First Arbitration\") against Respondent, with regard to the same investments that underlie the present arbitration. This First Arbitration eventually led to the Settlement Agreement, which was then recorded in the 2000 Award. Paragraph 31 of the Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of all disputes arising from or in connection with the Agreement by ICSID Arbitration in accordance with the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES**\n--------------------\n\n36.\n\nClaimant, Mr. Joseph Charles Lemire, is a national of the United States of America residing at 91 Saksagansko St., Office 8.01032 Kiev, Ukraine. Claimant is a majority shareholder, through CJSC \"Mirakom Ukraina\" (\"Mirakom\") of CJSC \"Radiocompany Gala\" (\"Gala\"), a closed joint stock company constituted in 1995 under the laws of Ukraine with its principal office located at the same address as Mr. Lemire\u2019s residence. Gala is a music radio station in Ukraine currently licenced to broadcast on various frequencies in Ukraine.\n\n37.\n\nRespondent is the State of Ukraine. With respect to the events giving rise to the present arbitration, Respondent has acted through its President, Prime Minister, Parliament, Ministry of Defence, the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting (the \"National Council\"), the Ukrainian State Centre of Radio Frequencies (the \"State Centre\"), the State Committee on Communications and Information Technology (the \"State Committee\"), all of which are organs for which Ukraine is responsible under international law.\n\n**IV. RELIEF SOUGHT**\n---------------------\n\n38.\n\nClaimant seeks relief for alleged breaches of the Settlement Agreement/2000 Award and for alleged breaches of the BIT following the 2000 Award. More specifically, Claimant seeks1:\n\na) a decision declaring that Respondent has breached the 2000 Award and the BIT;\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 151.\n\n39.\n\nb) a decision ordering Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of 55,173 million USD on account of its breaches of the 2000 Award and the BIT which had the effect of preventing Claimant from developing Gala into a full national network as of January 1, 2001 and from establishing two other national networks (an FM radio network as of January 1, 2002 and an AM network as of July 1, 2004); or\n\n- alternatively ordering Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of 51,277 million USD on account of its breaches of the 2000 Award and the BIT which blocked Claimant from developing Gala into a full national network as of January 1, 2004 and developing a second FM national network as of January 1, 2002; or\n\n- alternatively ordering Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of 34,732 million USD on account of its breaches of the 2000 Award and the BIT which blocked Claimant from developing Gala into a full national network as of January 1, 2001;\n\nc) a decision ordering Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of one million USD for Respondent\u2019s failure to take reasonable measures to correct interference with Gala\u2019s 100 FM frequency, in breach of the Award and the BIT from the year 2000 to August 2008;\n\nd) a decision ordering Respondent to pay Claimant damages in the amount of 958,000 USD representing loss of profits for Respondent\u2019s enactment of the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting (the \"LTR\") and/or application thereof in breach of the BIT;\n\ne) a decision ordering Respondent to pay Claimant moral damages in the amount of three million USD for Respondent\u2019s harassment of Claimant, in breach of the BIT;\n\nf) the costs of this arbitration, including all expenses that Claimant has incurred, legal counsel, experts and consultants, as well as Claimant\u2019s internal costs in pursuing this arbitration, all of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, fees for use of the facilities of the Centre;\n\ng) compound interest at a rate of LIBOR + 3, compounded semi-annually, to be established on the above amounts as of the date these amounts are determined to have been due to Claimant; and\n\nh) any such other and further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal shall deem appropriate.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent seeks2:\n\na) a decision dismissing all Claimant\u2019s claims, or a substantial part thereof, for lack of jurisdiction;\n\nb) a decision dismissing Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety; and\n\nc) a decision awarding to Respondent its fees, costs and expenses in connection with this proceeding.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 252; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 653.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided to join Respondent\u2019s objections on jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute, in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**V. 1. Positions of Claimant and Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nClaimant\u2019s basic allegations in this arbitration are twofold:\n\n- first, that Respondent\u2019s actions constitute a breach of the Settlement Agreement; and\n\n- second, that Respondent has breached the BIT by subjecting Claimant to unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, harassment and creeping expropriation and by enacting a new law in violation of Article II.6 of the BIT.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent raises a number of jurisdictional objections3:\n\n- that the Centre lacks jurisdiction for claims arising out of the Settlement Agreement;\n\n- that there is no investment underlying the claims related to the tenders for additional frequencies;\n\n- that Claimant\u2019s capital invested did not emanate from abroad as required;\n\n- that Claimant has not made out a *prima facie* case of expropriation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial in Support of its Objections to Jurisdiction; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 146-256.\n\n44.\n\nClaimant denies these jurisdictional objections and affirms the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence to decide all claims raised.\n\n**V.2. Decision of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn order for the Centre to have jurisdiction and for the Tribunal to have competence with regard to these claims, four well known conditions must be met, three deriving from Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and a fourth resulting from the general principle of law of non-retroactivity:\n\n- first, a condition *ratione personae',* the dispute must oppose a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State;\n\n- second, a condition *ratione materiae'.* the dispute must be a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment;\n\n- third, a condition *ratione voluntatis',* the Contracting State and the investor must consent in writing that the dispute be settled through ICSID arbitration;\n\n- fourth, a condition *ratione temporis',* the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time.\n\n46.\n\nThe jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must be read in conjunction with those of the BIT. The relevant provisions are Article VI. 1 and VI.4 of the BIT, which read as follows:\n\n*\"VI. 1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party\u2019s foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*VI.4**. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:*\n\n*(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and*\n\n*(b) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958.\"*\n\n47.\n\nIn addition, Article I.1(a) of the BIT defines the term \"investment\":\n\n*1. For the purposes of this Treaty,*\n\n*(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly of indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts;...\"*\n\n48.\n\nJurisdiction *ratione temporis* has not been challenged and the Tribunal will not analyze it. It will focus on jurisdiction *ratione personae* (V.3), *materiae* (V.4) and *voluntatis* (V.5).\n\n**V.3. Jurisdiction** *Ratione Personae*\n----------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nClaimant is, and at all relevant times has been, a national of the United States and thus a *\"national of another Contracting State \"* under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as well as a *\"national of a Party\"* under the BIT. Ukraine, since July 7, 2000, is a State Party to both the ICSID Convention and to the BIT.\n\n50.\n\nThe requirements for ICSID jurisdiction *ratione personae* are hence satisfied.\n\n**V.4. Jurisdiction** *Ratione Materiae*\n----------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention further requires a *\"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".* Claimant submits that he has made investments in Gala Radio and that he is Gala\u2019s major shareholder. It is undisputed that the present dispute is a legal dispute and that it arose directly out of these investments.\n\nClaimant\u2019s investment\n---------------------\n\n52.\n\nGala was not founded by Mr. Lemire - in fact, Ukrainian legislation requires that radio broadcasters be founded by Ukrainian nationals4. The law however authorizes foreign investments in the broadcasting sector (Article 12.3 of LTR). Mr. Lemire bought participations in Gala, an existing company, which already had a radio licence, and which had been promoted by a Ukrainian citizen, Mr. Glieb Maliutin5, and founded by a Ukrainian company called Provisen. On June 8, 1995, two Investment Agreements were signed by Mr. Lemire providing (somewhat diffusely) for contributions in cash and in kind amounting to 290,000 USD plus 3,000,000 USD6.\n\nArticle 13 of the 1993 Law on Television and Broadcasting\n\nRespondent has presented a Witness Statement from Mr. Maliutin.\n\nAnnex F of EBS Expert Report.\n\n53.\n\nThe actual amount contributed by Mr. Lemire is disputed. Respondent\u2019s expert acknowledges that at least 141,000 USD were invested by Mr. Lemire7 and Respondent has accepted an investment of 236,000 USD8. Claimant himself states that his investment amounts to well over 5,000,000 USD9. This number seems to include real estate held in Mr. Lemire\u2019s name, and let rent free to Gala, and payments made directly by him on behalf of the company10. No document has actually been produced in this arbitration, giving a precise breakdown of Mr. Lemire\u2019s contributions. It seems, moreover, that for accounting purposes, the expenditures made directly by Mr. Lemire on behalf of Gala are not recorded in Gala\u2019s books11.\n\nEBS Expert Report, p. 5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit at the hearing RH-1, p. 23.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 279, at 10.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 281, at 14.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 286, at 23.\n\n54.\n\nSumming up the evidence, the Tribunal has no doubt that Mr. Lemire actually made an investment in Ukraine, although the undisputed total amount is only 236,000 USD. Respondent has not challenged that Mr. Lemire is - at least since 2006 - indirect owner of 100% of the share capital of Gala. The evidence shows that Mr. Lemire has made payments with his own moneys on behalf of Gala. But the record of the actual amounts paid has not been produced, and that the total exceeds 5,000,000 USD is nothing more than affirmation12.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript, p. 285, para. 20 and p. 304, para. 9.\n\n55.\n\nIt is immaterial that Claimant holds his controlling stake in Gala through Mirakom. Article I.1(a) of the BIT accords treaty protection to *\"every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals... of the other Party\".*\n\nTransfer of funds from abroad\n-----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant has failed to prove the transfer of his invested funds into Ukraine from abroad. However, neither the BIT nor the ICSID Convention includes an origin-of-capital requirement. Nor is such a requirement to be inferred from the purposes of the BIT and/or the ICSID Convention.\n\n57.\n\nIn setting out the purposes of the BIT, the Preamble emphasises the promotion of investments of nationals of one party in the territory of the other, without any reference to the origin of the funds invested; and Article I.3 of the BIT implies that reinvested earnings qualify as investments under the BIT; these earnings by definition originate within the host country.\n\n58.\n\nMoreover, Claimant\u2019s certificate of registration dated September 18, 1995 shows that at least part of his investment capital originates from abroad; this suffices for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n59.\n\nHence, the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction are also satisfied *ratione materiae.*\n\n**V.5. Jurisdiction** *Ratione Voluntatis*\n------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nA singular feature of this arbitration is that consent to ICSID arbitration was formalized in two different legal instruments: the Settlement Agreement and the BIT. Each will be analyzed separately.\n\n**A) Jurisdiction With Respect to Claims Based on an Alleged Breach of the Settlement Agreement/2000 Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement contains the following dispute resolution provision in clause 31 (the \"Arbitration Clause\"):\n\n*\"All the disputes arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled by negotiations. In the event no solution is achieved within 60 days from the date of beginning of negotiations, either party may address to the ICSID its application for settlement under the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.\"*\n\n62.\n\nRespondent however objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction for alleged claims under the Settlement Agreement on two grounds, namely the fact that (a) the Settlement Agreement was recorded as an award, and (b) the Arbitration Clause refers, for settlement of disputes under the Agreement, to the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, rather than the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\na) Settlement Agreement as an award\n-----------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nRespondent argues that the parties voluntarily transformed the Settlement Agreement into an enforceable award, in order to benefit from the jurisdictional effect of such measure. Claimant thus waived his right to the dispute resolution mechanism contained in the original accord13. Awards under the ICSID Additional Facility must be enforced through the New York Convention - there is no scope for enforcement through the arbitration clause inserted in the Settlement Agreement.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 155.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with Respondent\u2019s theory. It is not supported by the text of the ICSID Convention or applicable arbitration rules, and it is based on a misunderstanding of the differences between disputes arising out of a contract and enforcement of an award.\n\n65.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement is first and foremost a contract, product of consent expressed by both parties. Settlement agreements, like all contracts, may give rise to disputes. In the Settlement Agreement Mr. Lemire and Ukraine agreed that disputes arising *\"from or in connection\"* with this contract should be settled by arbitration.\n\n66.\n\nAfter executing the Settlement Agreement both parties requested, and the Tribunal in the First Arbitration agreed that \"the Tribunal shall record the settlement in the form of an award\" (as authorized by Article 49(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules).\n\n67.\n\nThe precise text of the 2000 Award is as follows:\n\n*\"Accordingly the Tribunal orders unanimously that the said agreement between the Parties as set forth below shall be recorded verbatim as an award on agreed terms\".*\n\nAnd then the award copies *ad pedem literae* the full text of the Settlement Agreement, including the Arbitration Clause.\n\n68.\n\nRespondent\u2019s basic argument is that, by accepting that the Settlement Agreement be recorded as an award, Claimant was waiving his right to the Arbitration Clause.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. There is no hint that, by requesting the Tribunal to issue the consent award, Claimant proposed and Respondent accepted neutralisation of the Arbitration Clause.\n\n70.\n\nIt is very telling that the 2000 Award reproduces the complete text of the Settlement Agreement, including the Arbitration Clause. The parties could have requested that the Arbitration Clause be excluded from the 2000 Award. They did not. What the 2000 Award proves is that as of the date of the request of its issuance, each party reiterated its consent that all disputes arising from or in connection with the Settlement Agreement be solved by arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nIn fact, the purpose and meaning of the consent award is very transparent. What the parties were seeking when they asked for the 2000 Award was twofold:\n\n- on the one hand, they wished to have the possibility of recognition and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement through the New York Convention; i.e. that a Court recognise the legal force and effect of the award and ensure that it is carried out in accordance with its terms;\n\n- on the other, if any dispute arose from or in connection with the Settlement Agreement, the parties reiterated their agreement that disputes should be resolved by arbitration.\n\n72.\n\nWith regard to the Settlement Agreement, the relief sought by Claimant in this arbitration is a declaration that Respondent has breached its obligations and an order for payment of damages. The thrust of Claimant\u2019s argument is that during the execution of the Settlement Agreement, Respondent has defaulted. Respondent denies such accusation. Consequently, a dispute regarding the execution of the Settlement Agreement has arisen.\n\n73.\n\nThis dispute can and must be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Clause 31 of the Settlement Agreement:\n\n- first, because that is what the parties bargained for in the Arbitration Clause; and\n\n- second, because a procedure under the New York Convention before a national Court can only result in the recognition and enforcement of the award, not in resolving a dispute related to the breach of obligations and the determination of damages; if Claimant had submitted the relief sought in this procedure to a national Court, Respondent could have validly raised the defence of Article II.3 of the New York Convention14, and requested that the judge refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\nArticle II.3 of the New York Convention provides that: *\"The Court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this Article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed\".*\n\nb) Reference to ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Arbitration Clause provides for *\"settlement under the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules\"* of *\"all the disputes arising from or in connection with this Agreement\".*\n\n75.\n\nWhen the Settlement Agreement was signed on March 20, 2000 Ukraine had not ratified the ICSID Convention, and consequently the Centre could only administer arbitrations involving Ukraine under the Additional Facility Rules (Article 2(a)). Things moved quickly thereafter. On July 7, 2000 the ICSID Convention entered into force in Ukraine. With the effectiveness in Ukraine of the ICSID Convention, the Additional Facility became unavailable and was superseded by arbitration under ICSID Rules. Notwithstanding this fact, the parties requested, and on September 18, 2000 the Tribunal in the First Arbitration issued the 2000 Award, with an unchanged Arbitration Clause.\n\n76.\n\nClaimant argues that the reference to the Additional Facility in the Arbitration Clause implicitly includes a reference to ICSID proper, once it became available15.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated March 17, 2008, paras. 13 and 14; Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, paras. 39-43.\n\n77.\n\nRespondent objects and refers to the clear, unambiguous terms of the Arbitration Clause16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial in Support of its Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 19.\n\n78.\n\nOn this issue the Tribunal sides with Claimant.\n\n79.\n\nThe Arbitration Clause states that *\"either party may address to the ICSID its application for settlement\",* and then adds *\"under the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules\".* These Rules were available when the Clause was signed, but no longer once the Clause was incorporated into the 2000 Award, and since then they have ceased to be available. They have been superseded by the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n80.\n\nImprecise arbitration clauses are a frequent occurrence in commercial arbitration. They must be interpreted by the arbitrators, in order to restore the true intention of the parties, distorted by the parties\u2019 ignorance of the mechanics of arbitration, error in designating the correct institution or rules, or, as here, supervening legal developments17.\n\nThis is not controversial: see e.g. Fouchard/Gaillard/Goldman, \"International Commercial Arbitration\" (1999), p. 263.\n\n81.\n\nIn our case, the true intent of the parties is very clear: the Arbitration Clause explicitly says that *\"either party may address to ICSID its application for the settlement\"* of the dispute. The very wording of the Arbitration Clause evidences the parties\u2019 wish that disputes arising from the Settlement Agreement be settled through arbitration administered by ICSID, and not through any other dispute settlement mechanism, nor by any national Court.\n\n82.\n\nWhere the parties were unclear is not in the description of the dispute settlement mechanism which they preferred, but in an ancillary point: the precise rules which the institution entrusted with the administration of the arbitration should apply. The parties correctly referred to the Rules which were applicable at the time the Settlement Agreement was executed - the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. And when the Settlement Agreement was recorded as an award a couple of months later, they did not take into account that in the meantime Ukraine had ratified the ICSID Convention, that the applicable arbitration rules now were the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and that the rules which they were referring to- the ICSID Additional Facility Rules -were in fact no longer available.\n\n83.\n\nThe ambiguity elided by the parties when they recorded the Settlement Agreement as an award is purely technical and ancillary, and cannot distort the real intent: that any dispute arising from or in connection with the Settlement Agreement be settled by arbitration administered by ICSID, and governed by the appropriate rules approved by the Centre: before Ukraine had ratified the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules; thereafter, the ordinary ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**B) Jurisdiction With Respect to Claims Based on an Alleged Violation of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nBy Article VI.3 of the BIT, Ukraine agreed that investment disputes with American investors be submitted to arbitration administered by the Centre. Claimant accepted the offer by filing this arbitration. Respondent objects to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence, but not with regard to the claims *in toto,* but only with regard to some specific claims.\n\n85.\n\nThese claims, and the reasons for objecting to jurisdiction, are explained in the following paragraphs.\n\na) Claims related to tenders for frequencies and broadcasting licences\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s competence with respect to claims arising out of Claimant\u2019s failure in tenders for additional frequencies on the ground that such tenders precede investments and that pre-investment activities fall outside the ICSID Convention. Respondent, however, seems to concede that such pre-investment activities are within the scope of the BIT18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 184.\n\n87.\n\nClaimant disagrees19, arguing that Mr. Lemire established investments in radio networks in Ukraine, and that they were harmed by Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 52.\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal sides with Claimant.\n\nPre-investment activities\n-------------------------\n\n89.\n\nMr. Lemire\u2019s claim related to tenders for frequencies and broadcasting licences does not refer to, and cannot be considered as, a pre-investment activity. Pre-investment activities are those which precede the actual investment. Whether pre-investment activities merit treaty protection is debatable. But it is irrelevant for the purpose of adjudicating Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration, since the Tribunal has already established that Mr. Lemire has made investments in Gala Radio and is Gala\u2019s sole shareholder, and that these investments qualify for protection under the BIT.\n\n90.\n\nIf an investor claims that his investment, once made, was subsequently denied frequencies and broadcasting licences in violation of Ukraine\u2019s obligations as assumed in the BIT, this claim constitutes an \"investment dispute\" for the purposes of Article VI of the BIT; the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence to adjudicate it.\n\n91.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the text of the BIT. The BIT expressly extends protection to *\"associated activities\"* which include *\"access to...licences, permits and other approvals....\"* (see Articles I.1 (e) and II. 11 (b) of the BIT). Article II.3 (b) moreover provides that *\"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the... expansion... of investments\"*. The allocation of frequencies was a condition for Claimant\u2019s ability to expand his investment. Claimant\u2019s allegations related to tenders for frequencies and licences thus fall within the scope of the BIT.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRespondent submits that disputes related to the allocation of new frequencies, while arguably within the ambit of the BIT, do not arise *\"directly\"* out of an investment and therefore fall short of the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In Respondent\u2019s view, moreover, the narrower definition in the ICSID Convention prevails over the broader definition in the BIT.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal sees the force in Respondent\u2019s submission that bilateral treaties cannot extend the scope of the multilateral ICSID Convention. However, where the ICSID Convention is open to interpretation, such interpretation should seek compatibility rather than contradiction.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore determine whether disputes related to the allocation of frequencies and issuance of broadcasting licences may be considered as *\"arising directly out of an investment\"* within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. For this purpose, Claimant\u2019s case must be distinguished from the scenario where an applicant intends to enter a market for the first time. In such scenario, the application for frequencies and licences indeed is a step towards facilitating a planned investment, because no investment exists at the time of the allocation process.\n\n95.\n\nIn the present case, Claimant had already invested in Gala Radio; and Gala was a going concern at the time of the tenders. The applications for additional frequencies and licences formed an integral part of Gala\u2019s business operations. They were intended to defend and expand Gala\u2019s market share against growing competition and thus enhance the sustainability and profitability of Claimant\u2019s investment. Disputes affecting these objectives thus are directly related to Claimant\u2019s investment as controlling shareholder of Gala.\n\n96.\n\nIn accordance with the purposes of the ICSID Convention and consistent with its wording, the Tribunal therefore affirms its jurisdiction for disputes arising out of Gala\u2019s treatment in tender proceedings for additional frequencies and licences.\n\n97.\n\nFor this conclusion, it is immaterial whether the receipt of additional frequencies had already been envisaged in Claimant\u2019s initial business plan and whether Respondent had made any commitment to support such a business plan. It suffices that the additional frequencies were sought by Gala as part of its strategy to defend and/or expand its market share.\n\n98.\n\nIt is furthermore immaterial whether additional frequencies were sought to extend the reach of Gala\u2019s existing program or to access new audiences with newly designed programs. In either case, the applications were part of Gala\u2019s business strategy to maintain and enhance its position in the Ukrainian market. They formed an integral part of Gala\u2019s overall business operation. The Tribunal\u2019s assumption of competence thus extends to applications by Gala for frequencies with a view to creating new networks for young and mature audiences20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 189 and 202.\n\nb) Claimant has failed to establish *a prima facie* case of expropriation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nRespondent has raised the issue that there is an initial threshold that must be crossed by any claimant arguing expropriation: that the facts adduced show at least *prima facie* the legal requirements of expropriation under international law21. And in Ukraine\u2019s opinion, the very facts alleged by Claimant are not capable of constituting expropriation, and consequently the Tribunal should dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction - as did the Tribunal in the *Telenor v. Hungary* case22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 239.\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communication A.S. v. The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No.ARB/04/15, Award of 13 September 2006.\n\n100.\n\nClaimant countered Respondent\u2019s objection arguing that for jurisdictional purposes the *prima facie* test was in fact easily met. As Claimant explained23, he was presenting claims for:\n\n- expropriation of a beauty salon;\n\n- expropriation of the rights to the Energy trademark; and\n\n- creeping expropriation of the Gala Radio network, a process that yet has to be completed but which, in Claimant\u2019s submission, appears imminent.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 88\n\n101.\n\nIn the course of the procedure, Claimant has however dropped the claims for expropriation of the beauty salon and of the Energy trademark24, and the creeping expropriation of the Gala Radio network is subsumed in the allegation of harassment and a request for moral damages (see paragraph 500 below).\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial.\n\n102.\n\nRespondent\u2019s allegation consequently has become moot.\n\n**VI. ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nIn the Settlement Agreement of March 20, 2000, Respondent assumed the following obligations:\n\nClause 13(a):\n\n*\"By April 15, 2000 the Commission of experts, appointed by the Respondent, shall examine the quality of broadcasting within the radio frequencies band of FM 100-108. Based on the conclusions of the Commission, the Respondent will take necessary, reasonable among others, technical measures to remove the obstacles (if any) for radio broadcasting of Gala Radio on FM 100 in Kiev by June 1, 2000\".*\n\nClause 13(b):\n\n*\"By May 15, 2000 the Respondent in person of the State Committee on Communications and Information Technology, agrees to use its best possible efforts to consider in a positive way the application of Gala Radio to provide it with the licences for radio frequencies (provided there are free frequencies bands) in the following cities: [...]*\n\n*The Claimant can apply for the radio channels in the above cities to the National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting (hereinafter called \"the National Council\") in a due course in accordance with the current legislation after the National Council has been fully personally formed under the existing law of Ukraine. The Respondent, within the limits of its powers, will assist for the positive consideration of this issue at the National Council.*\n\n*The granting of licences for radio frequencies and broadcasting channels will be made in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation upon payment of the licence fees\".*\n\n104.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent has defaulted on both sets of obligations. Respondent\u2019s position, on the contrary, is that it has fully complied with these obligations.\n\n105.\n\nBefore analysing the parties\u2019 allegation, it is necessary to establish the law applicable to the Settlement Agreement (VI. 1), and the criteria to be applied in its construction (VI.2).\n\n**VI. 1. Applicable Law**\n-------------------------\n\n106.\n\nClause 30 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the applicable law shall be that determined by *\"Article 55 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules\".* The relevant article in the Additional Facility Rules is in fact Article 54. The mistake is an obvious typographical error, and the Tribunal has no doubt that the common intent of the parties was to refer to Article 54. In accordance with this rule the Tribunal shall apply *\"(a) the law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable and (b) such rules of international law as the Tribunal considers applicable\".*\n\n107.\n\nShould the Tribunal make use of this authorization to apply not only a municipal law, determined through conflict of laws rules, but also the *\"rules of international law... the Tribunal considers applicable\"?*\n\n108.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement contains an extensive chapter called *\"Principles of Interpretation and Implementation of the Agreement\"*, which includes Clauses 20 through 26. These Clauses were reproduced, with very light linguistic adjustments, from the 1994 UNIDROIT Principles25.\n\nThe 1994 UNIDROIT Principles have now been superseded by the 2004 edition.\n\n109.\n\nIt is impossible to place the UNIDROIT Principles - a private codification of civil law, approved by an intergovernmental institution - within the traditional sources of law. The UNIDROIT Principles are neither treaty, nor compilation of usages, nor standard terms of contract. They are in fact a manifestation of transnational law.\n\n110.\n\nAs the Preamble to the Principles states, they *\"shall be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by them\"* and they *\"may be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by \u2018general principles of law \u2019, the \u2018lex mercatoria \u2019 or the like\".*\n\n111.\n\nWhen negotiating the Settlement Agreement, the parties evidently gave thought to the issue of applicable law, and were apparently unable to reach an agreement to apply either Ukrainian or US law. In this situation, what the parties did was to incorporate extensive parts of the UNIDROIT Principles into their agreement, and to include a clause which authorises the Tribunal either to select a municipal legal system, or to apply the rules of law the Tribunal considers appropriate. Given the parties\u2019 implied negative choice of any municipal legal system, the Tribunal finds that the most appropriate decision is to submit the Settlement Agreement to the rules of international law, and within these, to have particular regard to the UNIDROIT Principles.\n\n**VI.2. Interpretation**\n------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe parties have discussed the principles of interpretation to be applied to the Settlement Agreement. This issue is extensively dealt with in Clauses 20 through 26 of the Agreement.\n\n113.\n\nClaimant has emphasized Clauses 20 *(\u2018good faith and fair dealing in international* business\"), 22 *(\u2018common intent of the Parties* \"), 23 (especially reference to *\"preliminary negotiations\")* and 26 (non-performance to include *\"improper performance or late performance\")* as well as Articles 1.7 and 4.1 of the 1994 UNIDROIT Principles. Respondent has referred to Clause 27 of the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which the Settlement Agreement *\"constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings between them with respect to the matters covered herein\".* Ukraine also relies on Article 5.5 of the 1994 UNIDROIT Principles *(\u2018the way* *in which the obligation is expressed in the contraer)* as the primary factor in determining the scope of an obligation.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the \"common intent\" of the parties determines the scope of contractual obligations. However, the analysis of the common intent must start from the wording of the contract; and it must be presumed that the wording, as understood by a reasonable impartial person, properly reflects the common intent. While this presumption may be rebutted, the party doing so bears the burden of proof that the common intent differs from the wording. \"Good faith\" and \"fairness in the market place\" arguments are appropriate for interpreting ambiguous wording and filling lacunae in the text, but they can scarcely prevail against the clear wording of a contractual provision.\n\n115.\n\nIn accordance with Clause 23 of the Settlement Agreement, preliminary negotiations must - among other factors - be taken into account \"for interpreting this Agreement\". But Clause 27 provides that the Settlement Agreement \"supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings\". Read together, these Clauses require that expectations raised during the negotiations of the Settlement Agreement must be reflected in the text of the Agreement. The text of the Settlement Agreement is the only source of obligations. The fact that an undertaking was discussed, or even orally agreed to during the negotiation phase, is not enough. The obligation must have been recorded in the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement does include an obligation, then the scope of the undertaking can be construed in accordance with the expectations of the parties during the negotiation. Without support in the text, expectations nurtured by Claimant do not give rise to contractual obligations of Respondent.\n\n116.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent has breached its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to correct interferences (VI.3.) and to award 11 FM frequencies (VI.4). Each allegation will be examined separately.\n\n**VI.3. Respondent\u2019s Failure To Correct Interferences**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nClause 13(a) of the Settlement Agreement sets out Respondent\u2019s undertaking on this matter as follows:\n\n*\"By April 15, 2000 the Commission of experts, appointed by the Respondent, shall examine the quality of broadcasting within the radio frequencies band of FM 100-108. Based on the conclusions of the Commission, the Respondent will take necessary, reasonable among others, technical measures to remove the obstacles (if any) for radio broadcasting of Gala Radio on FM 100 in Kiev by June 1, 2000\".*\n\n118.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent defaulted on its obligations under the above provision by failing to26:\n\n- appoint a Commission of experts;\n\n- examine the quality of broadcasting on FM 100 between March 20, 2000 (execution of the Settlement Agreement) and April 15, 2000; and cure interference with Gala\u2019s FM 100 frequency by June 1, 2000.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 54.\n\n119.\n\nAccording to Claimant, such interference *\"has continued unabated from prior to the time of the Settlement Agreement until today27\"* (August 2008), and *\"there was ongoing work between UCRF personnel and engineers from Gala Radio to attempt to cure the problem and Claimant had indeed continually complained about the existing interference on Gala\u2019s 100 FM frequency28.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 125.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 46.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent counters that the function of the \"Commission of Experts\" was performed by the State Centre, which under Ukrainian law was in charge of detecting interferences with radio frequencies and was adequately equipped for that task. Between January 1999 and March 2000, the State Centre carried out a series of measurements and tests regarding alleged interference with FM 100; and tests on March 9 and 10, 2000 showed that no interference existed at that time with Gala\u2019s FM 100.\n\n121.\n\nAccording to Respondent, there was no interference with FM 100 between March 20 (the date of the execution of the Settlement Agreement) and June 1, 2000 (the final date for remedial measures against any interference under Clause 13(a))29. Only a total of seven complaints about interferences were received from Claimant, the first on January 30, 2002 and the other between July 2004 and June 2007; no complaint was received in 2000 and 2001. The complaints in January 2002 and thereafter related to incidents that had arisen long after June 2000 and were thus outside the scope of the Settlement Agreement. Claimant consistently cooperated with the State Centre on the matter of interference and, before the institution of the present arbitral proceedings, Claimant never insisted on the appointment of an *ad hoc-expert* commission for examining interferences with Gala\u2019s FM 100.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 291.\n\n122.\n\nClaimant has presented three specific breaches by Respondent of its obligations under Clause 13(a):\n\n- the State Centre is not the appropriate \"Commission of Experts\" (A);\n\n- the interferences were not examined as provided for in the Settlement Agreement (B); and\n\n- insufficient measures were taken to correct interferences (C).\n\n123.\n\nThese contentions will be analysed in the following sections.\n\n**A) The State Centre as the \"Commission of Experts\"**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nClause 13(a) of the Settlement Agreement entrusts the duty to examine the interferences to *\"the Commission of experts, appointed by the Respondent\"*. It does not require that the commission be constituted *ad hoc.*\n\n125.\n\nFurthermore, Clause 13(a) clearly states that the Commission be appointed exclusively by Respondent, without participation of Claimant in the appointment process. The provision does not include any requirements for the composition of the commission, such as a representation of several agencies, or the inclusion of independent experts. Respondent was therefore free to entrust the tasks under Clause 13(a) to any group of experts with the technical skills to do the job.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent chose the State Centre as the \"Commission of Experts\" with the duty to perform the examinations required under Clause 13(a). Claimant has not pleaded that the State Centre was unfit to examine the alleged interferences. In fact, the State Centre is the public entity which in accordance with Ukrainian legislation supervises interferences in radio frequencies, and it is adequately equipped to perform this task. To the Tribunal, the choice of the State Centre is appropriate, given the wording of the Settlement Agreement, and reasonable, given its experience and scope of activity.\n\n127.\n\nThere is one further argument: the record shows that Claimant never challenged the State Centre\u2019s role as expert commission before instituting this arbitration, i.e. for some seven years. To the contrary, he has co-operated with the State Centre and addressed his complaints to it. He has thus acquiesced to the role of the State Centre.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal can hence not find a violation of Clause 13(a) in Respondent\u2019s assignment of the State Centre as expert commission.\n\n**B) Examination of Interferences**\n-----------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nPursuant to Clause 13(a), the examination of interferences should have taken place by April 15, 2000. In fact, such examinations were carried out between January 1999 and March 10, 2000, i.e. before execution of the Settlement Agreement on March 20, 2000. Claimant argues that these pre-agreement examinations are not sufficient to comply with the undertaking assumed by Ukraine in Clause 13(a) of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n130.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s opinion, the March 2000 tests proved the absence of any interference with Gala\u2019s FM 100, so that any further tests were pointless. The Settlement Agreement had been negotiated since November 1999, and during these negotiations, and as a sign of goodwill, Respondent carried out the examinations required by Clause 13(a), even before the Settlement Agreement was signed and came into force. The Settlement Agreement signed on March 20, 2000 provided that the examination of the quality of broadcasting be performed *\"by April 15, 2000\".* In fact, the examination had thus already been performed, before the signing of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n131.\n\nDoes this pre-agreement examination imply a default of Clause 13(a)?\n\n132.\n\nOne begins with the literal wording of the Clause, which requires that the examination be performed *\"by April 15, 2000\".* An examination on March 10, 2000 evidently meets that requirement. But a literal interpretation is just a first approach. In accordance with Clauses 20 and 22 of the Agreement, the guiding principles of any interpretation shall be the common intent of the parties and good faith.\n\n133.\n\nDid the common intent of the parties require that the examination be carried out after the signature of the Settlement Agreement? There is a very revealing fact: Claimant never requested that a second examination be performed after the signature of the Settlement Agreement. If he had, good faith would have precluded Respondent from refusing the request. But Mr. Lemire never did so. He accepted, at least tacitly, that the pre-agreement examination complied with the requirements of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n134.\n\nArticle 1.8 of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles prohibits inconsistent behaviour:\n\n*\"A party cannot act inconsistently with an understanding it has caused the other party to have and upon which that other party reasonably has acted in reliance to its detriment\".*\n\n135.\n\nMr. Lemire did not require a second examination, and Ukraine reasonably understood that Claimant felt satisfied with the first examination, and consequently did not carry out a second one. Mr. Lemire cannot now reversetrack and argue that Respondent defaulted on its contractual obligations.\n\n**C) Adoption of Technical Measures To Remove Interferences**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nClause 13(a) of the Settlement Agreement obliges Respondent to *\"take... technical measures to remove the obstacles (if any) for radio broadcasting of Gala Radio on FM 100... by June 1, 2000\".* This language clearly limits the scope of the obligation to obstacles that existed before June 1, 2000; obstacles that might have arisen after this date fall outside the scope of the Settlement Agreement. (As to Respondent\u2019s alleged duty to cure such obstacles under the BIT, see paragraph 493 below).\n\n137.\n\nTo find a breach of the Settlement Agreement, it is therefore crucial that interferences with Gala\u2019s FM 100 preexisted June 1, 2000. Claimant has pleaded this by alleging that interference *\"has continued unabated from prior to the time of the Settlement Agreement until today30\"*. Respondent, on the other hand, argues that no interference occurred between March 10 and June 1, 2000 and that any interference which occurred long after June 1, 2000 was isolated and cannot be traced back to a cause pre-existing on June 1, 200031.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 125.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 291-293.\n\n138.\n\nAs evidence for his assertion, Claimant presented a DVD of July 30, 200832 and witness statements on interferences of Messrs. Lemire33 and Denisenko34 (a manager of Gala). The witness statements, while confirming several interferences after June 2000, do not prove that the cause of such interferences pre-dated June 2000.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-96.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Witness Statement of Mr. Joseph Lemire dated 14 November 2008, p. 18 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Witness Statement of Mr. Sergey Denisenko dated 14 November 2008, pp. 7 and 8.\n\n139.\n\nClaimant has submitted seven letters to the State Centre or the National Council complaining about interferences with FM 10035. However, these letters date from January 2002 to June 2007; they do not offer any indication, let alone evidence, that the cause pre-dated June 2000. Respondent, on the other hand, has submitted some eighty documents with test results showing that at different times after June 2000, there was no interference with Gala\u2019s FM 10036.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibits CM-24, CM-63, CM-88, CM-114, CM-115 and CM-154; Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-82.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Exhibits R-29, R-63, R-87, R-88, R-104, R-140, R-141, R-146, R-149, R-155, R-205, R-314, R-315, R-316, R-317, R-318, R-322, R-326, R-347, R-369 andR-396.\n\n140.\n\nIf interferences with FM 100 had been observed between March and June 2000, Claimant could at that time have requested the examinations and remedial measures foreseen in Clause 13(a) of the Settlement Agreement. Yet, there is no record of any complaint or other action of Claimant in this respect during the period March 2000 through 30 January 2002.\n\n141.\n\nOn the basis of the above record and in light of the language of Clause 13(a), the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has failed to prove a violation of the Settlement Agreement in this respect.\n\n**VI.4. Allocation op Frequencies**\n-----------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe second allegation presented by Claimant refers to the granting of frequencies to Gala. Under Clause 13(b) of the Settlement Agreement, Respondent assumed several obligations with respect to the allocation of radio frequencies and broadcasting licences to Gala in 11 cities. The Clause reads as follows:\n\n*\"By May 15, 2000 the Respondent, in the person of the State Committee on Communications and Information Technology, agrees to use its best possible efforts to consider in a positive way the application of Gala Radio to provide it with the licences for radio frequencies (provided there are free frequencies bands) in the following cities: Kharkiv, Lviv, Donetsk, Zaporizhya, Lugansk, Simpheropol, Dniepropetrovsk, Odessa, Vynnitsa, Kryviy Rog, Uzhgorod.*\n\n*The Claimant can apply for the radio channels in the above cities to the National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting (hereinafter called \"the National Council\") in a due course in accordance with the current* *legislation after the National Council has been fully personally formed under the existing law of Ukraine. The Respondent, within the limits of its powers, will assist for the positive consideration of this issue at the National Council.*\n\n*The granting of licences for radio frequencies and broadcasting channels will be made in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation upon payment of the licence fees\".*\n\nSummary of facts\n----------------\n\n143.\n\nUnder Ukrainian law, broadcasting requires both (i) a \"radio frequency licence\" from the State Committee on Communications and Information Technology and (ii) a \"broadcasting licence\" from the National Council. The National Council is a regulatory body established directly by law37, independent of the Government and reporting to both the President and the Parliament of Ukraine.\n\nArticle 5, Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting dated December 21, 1993.\n\nDelivery of the licences required\n---------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nClaimant obtained all the licences mentioned in Clause 13(b) by October 9, 2002, i.e. within a period of some thirty months from the date of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n145.\n\nThe 11 radio frequency licences from the State Committee were obtained relatively expeditiously - two of them prior to the Settlement Agreement, four on April 14, 2000, another four on June 13, 2000, and the last on September 1, 2000.\n\n146.\n\nThe broadcasting licences suffered longer delays: two were received prior to the Settlement Agreement, seven on September 18, 2001, one on March 26, 2002, and the last on October 9, 2002.\n\n147.\n\nTwo broadcasting licences had already been awarded by the National Council prior to the Settlement Agreement. Thereafter, the National Council was temporarily inoperative. It was reconstituted in June 2000. After building the necessary administrative capacities, it resumed issuance of broadcasting licences in January 2001. Under the Ukrainian Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting, such licences were awarded on the basis of competitive tenders.\n\n148.\n\nAt its first meeting after its reconstitution on January 1, 2001, the National Council focused on issuing broadcasting licences to companies which were broadcasting on frequencies allocated to them by the State Committee during the time when the National Council was inoperative. Claimant was excluded from this tender. Shortly thereafter, on March 22, 2001, the National Council announced a tender, including eight of the nine frequencies still expected by Claimant under Clause 13(b) of the Settlement Agreement. The broadcasting licences for seven of these frequencies were granted to Gala on September 18, 2001. In March and October 2002, Claimant received the last two outstanding broadcasting licences.\n\n149.\n\nFour of the 11 frequencies allocated to Claimant under the Settlement Agreement were subsequently contested by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. These challenges were eventually resolved in 2008.\n\nViolations asserted by Claimant\n-------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nClaimant alleges seven violations of Clause 13(b) of the Settlement Agreement:\n\n- late issuance of frequency licences by the State Committee (A);\n\n- late constitution of the National Council (B);\n\n- award of licences to other companies at National Council\u2019s first meeting in January 2001 (C);\n\n- failure of National Council promptly to acknowledge the Settlement Agreement as binding (D);\n\n- late award of broadcasting licences by National Council (E);\n\n- allocation of low powered frequencies (F); and\n\n- allocation of four frequencies which were contested by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (G).\n\n151.\n\nRespondent denies all of the alleged violations.\n\n152.\n\nEach alleged breach will be analysed *seriatim.*\n\n**A) Issuance of Radio Frequencies by the State Committee**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nUnder Clause 13(b), paragraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement, *\"by May 15, 2000 the Respondent, in the person of the State [Committee] agrees to use its best possible efforts to consider in a positive way the application of Gala Radio to provide it with the licences for [11] radio frequencies [...]\".* In accordance with the express terms of this contractual provision, Respondent undertook only to apply its best efforts, so that the applications from Gala to the State Committee would be granted by May 15, 2000 - not to achieve that result.\n\n154.\n\nArticle 5.1.4 of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles defines the duty of best efforts in the following terms:\n\n*\"[...] To the extent that an obligation of a party involves a duty of best efforts in the performance of an activity, that party is bound to make such efforts as would be made by a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances\".*\n\n155.\n\nFor Claimant to establish a violation of this best efforts obligation, it is not sufficient to prove that by May 15, 2000 the 11 radio frequency licences had not been granted - the required test is that he produce evidence showing that Ukraine has failed to make such efforts as would be made by a reasonable government in the same circumstances.\n\n156.\n\nWhat is the factual situation?\n\n157.\n\nIn accordance with the Settlement Agreement Ukraine had to use its best efforts to grant the frequency licences within two months of signature (signature was on March 20, and the deadline was May 15). Of the 11 licences envisaged, six were granted by the State Committee before the May 15, 2000 deadline, another four by June 13, 2000 (i.e. within one month of May 15) and the last one on September 1, 2000 (within 2 1/2 months of the deadline).\n\n158.\n\nUkraine\u2019s efforts to induce its State Committee to grant the licences resulted in 11 of the 12 licences being issued within one month of the deadline. One licence was then granted with 2 1/2 months delay.\n\n159.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, these delays do not amount to a violation of Ukraine\u2019s best efforts obligation. There is often a gap between political decision and bureaucratic compliance. Paragraph 3 of Clause 13(b) explicitly requires that *\"the granting of licences... will be made in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation\".* There is no evidence that Ukraine abated its pressure on the State Committee to perform. The State Committee issued the licences within time limits which are not unreasonable in the context of Ukrainian administrative practices.\n\n**B) Late Constitution of the National Council**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIt is undisputed that the National Council - which had been founded in 1993 - became inoperative in March 1999, because its members were not appointed. It remained inoperative until it was reconstituted in June 2000.\n\n161.\n\nClaimant argues that the time period while the National Council was inoperative was abnormal and could not legitimately be expected38. This constitutes, in Claimant\u2019s opinion, a violation of the Settlement Agreement, and specifically of Respondent\u2019s obligation of good faith and fair dealing (Clause 20 of the Settlement Agreement).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.1.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal is unconvinced.\n\n163.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement lacks any obligation to reconstitute the National Council, nor even an indication of when this could happen. To the contrary, Clause 13(b), paragraph 2, specifically states that applications for broadcasting licences must be made *\"after the National Council has been fully personally formed)* without referring to any time frame - an explicit acceptance by Claimant that he was aware that the National Council was not operative at the time, and that the political decision to designate new members had to be implemented before the granting of the licences.\n\n164.\n\nThe National Council was in fact reconstituted in June 2000, three months after the signature of the Settlement Agreement. Nothing in the Settlement Agreement legitimizes an expectation on the part of Claimant of a faster rehabilitation of the National Council. The absence of any time frame, and the explicit warning in Clause 13(b), paragraph 2, that Gala\u2019s applications will have to wait for the reconstitution of the National Council, point to the contrary.\n\n**C) Failure of National Council To Promptly Acknowledge the Settlement Agreement as Binding**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nWhen the National Council was eventually reconstituted in June 2000, Claimant immediately made numerous attempts to contact its members and to establish the process for obtaining the frequencies. In Claimant\u2019s opinion, the National Council\u2019s lack of reaction violated Ukraine\u2019s duties to act in good faith (Clause 20) and to cooperate (Clause 24)39.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.3.\n\n166.\n\nClaimant\u2019s argument is not totally accurate.\n\n167.\n\nIt is undisputed that on March 20, 2001 the National Council adopted its Resolution No. 36 in which it decided to *\"recognize priority position of CJSC Radio Company Gala\"* in the allocation of broadcasting licences for the cities listed in Clause 13(b). It is immaterial whether the National Council\u2019s decision thus acknowledged a legal obligation, or whether it followed political considerations. In any case, it implies an acknowledgement of the Settlement Agreement and it granted Claimant the best position that he could expect.\n\n168.\n\nWas this acknowledgement by the National Council unduly late?\n\n169.\n\nThe National Council had just started in January 2001 the process of organizing tenders for broadcasting licences. Given the complexities surrounding the Gala decision (reconciling *\"positive consideration\"* of Claimant\u2019s interests under the Settlement Agreement with the independence of the National Council and competing interests of other applicants), the March 20, 2001 decision cannot be considered as unduly late.\n\n**D) Award of Licences to Other Companies at National Council\u2019s First Meeting in January 2001**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement regulates the issuance of broadcasting licences by the National Council in subparagraphs II and III of Clause 13(b) (reproduced *above).* These provisions create an obligation by Ukraine to *\"assist [Claimant] for the positive consideration of this issue [the awarding of licences] by the National Council\"*. This obligation is not absolute, but subject to important caveats:\n\n- first of all, there is no time limit for the awarding of the licences (the May 15, 2000 deadline only works for the licences from the State Committee);\n\n- second, Ukraine\u2019s obligation to assist is qualified with the words *\"within the limits of [Respondent\u2019s] power\" -* thus acknowledging that, in accordance with the law, the National Council is an independent public entity;\n\n- third, Claimant could apply *\"in a due course... after the National Council has been fully personally formed\" ',*\n\n- fourth, application and granting of the licences were to be *\"in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation\"',* Clause 16 specifically added that *\"the Agreement shall not be treated as a document granting any rights, benefits or privileges which are different or additional to the ordinary rights and obligations of a foreign investor in Ukraine in accordance with the Ukrainian laws and international treaties to which Ukraine is a party*\n\n171.\n\nThe National Council held its first tender in January 2001, i.e. some six months after its reconstitution. This time was used by the National Council to build the logistics and administrative capacities for proper tender procedures. No fault can be found in the fact that the National Council gave first priority to creating the enabling logistics and administrative capacities for such proceedings.\n\n172.\n\nIn its first tender in January 2001, the National Council did not include any of the frequencies for which Gala had received frequencies from the State Committee. Rather, the National Council focused only on frequencies on which radio stations had been broadcasting without a valid broadcasting licence at that time.\n\n173.\n\nClaimant submits that the organization of this first tender, from which Gala was excluded, implied a breach of the Settlement Agreement on two different counts:\n\n- first, the National Council should have taken the opportunity of the first meeting to act on the licences for Gala; and\n\n- second, the very existence of the first tender proves that radio stations existed which were broadcasting only with a licence from the State Committee, but without a licence from the National Council; since Gala already had licences from the State Committee, it should have been authorized to broadcast straight away.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with Claimant\u2019s first argument. Nothing in the Settlement Agreement implies that the National Council was bound to give first priority to Claimant. The National Council decided first to regularize broadcasting outside the law, which had developed during the time when it had been inoperative. This prioritization cannot be challenged under the Settlement Agreement. (As to the claim for violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (\"FET\") standard defined in the BIT, see paragraph 410 below).\n\n175.\n\nThe second argument merits a more in-depth analysis. Respondent itself has acknowledged that during the period when the National Council became inoperative, *\"the State [Committee] became the central authority of the executive power, administering communications and radio frequencies of Ukraine and it developed the practice of granting licences for use of radio frequencies before the tenders for frequencies were announced40'\".* What happened was illegal: under Ukrainian law, a radio station could not start broadcasting until it had obtained the necessary authorization from the National Council. Notwithstanding the legal requirements, during the 15-month period when the National Council was inoperative, certain Ukrainian companies were *de facto* awarded frequencies and authorized to broadcast, although they had only received the authorization from the State Committee.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 207.\n\n176.\n\nGiven this factual situation, Claimant argues that it could and should have been awarded frequencies and authorized to broadcast, once it had obtained the authorization from the State Committee in the summer of 2000, without having to wait for the reconstitution of the National Council and its formal tender procedure. And that, by not having done so, Ukraine violated its obligations under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n177.\n\nAfter due consideration and some hesitation, the Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s argument. In the Settlement Agreement, Ukraine could not undertake to perform acts contrary to Ukrainian law nor to authorise Claimant to operate new frequencies without the licence from the National Council; this would have violated the LTR. And Clause 13(b) specifically refers to the need for the National Council to be reconstituted and to issue the necessary licences.\n\n178.\n\nBut while it was agreed between Claimant and Respondent to act as required by Ukrainian law, Ukraine *de facto* authorized domestic radio companies to start broadcasting without the necessary authorizations. This situation was then cured in the first tender organized by the National Council after its reconstitution. While these actions do not constitute a violation of the Settlement Agreement, their status under the BIT will be analysed as such *below* at paragraph 410.\n\n**E) Late Award of Broadcasting Licences by National Council**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe facts regarding the issuance of the broadcasting licences by National Council can be summarized as follows.\n\nFacts\n-----\n\n180.\n\nOn March 1, 2000 (i.e. before the Settlement Agreement had actually been signed), the Minister of Economy of Ukraine wrote a proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers in order to *\"entrust the [State Committee] and the [National Council] to allocate to CJSC RC \"Gala\" the following frequency assignments*...41\". The frequencies referred to were five of those mentioned in the Settlement Agreement. Respondent has not provided any similar proposal for the remaining six frequencies promised in the Settlement Agreement, nor has Respondent submitted any decision from the Cabinet of Ministers approving the proposal of the Minister of Economy.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-27.\n\n181.\n\nThe record shows no further documents relating to the National Council, before a letter dated February 22, 2001 sent by Mr. Lemire to the Ministry of the Economy42. In the meantime, the State Committee had issued its licences, and the National Council had been reconstituted. Mr. Lemire\u2019s letter starts by stating that *\"we have practically reached finalization of performance of the terms of the Dispute settlement Agreement\".* This recital is important, because it shows that, at that moment, Claimant was convinced that Ukraine had not breached its obligations. Mr. Lemire then goes on, stating that a *\"serious problem\"* has arisen with the National Council because *\"now this authority says that our frequencies are subject to a tender that will begin in some weeks\".* He adds *\"we understand that such situation has arisen due to the fact that the National Council is not properly informed\"* and asks the Ministry of the Economy to intervene.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-39.\n\n182.\n\nThe record does not show the actions adopted by the Ministry of the Economy, but some advice must have been transmitted from the Ministry of the Economy because it is a fact that three weeks later, on March 20, 2001, the National Council decided to *\"recognize priority position of CJSC Radio Company Gala\"* in the allocation of broadcasting licences for the cities listed in Clause 13(b)43.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-40.\n\n183.\n\nClaimant has argued that in a meeting on March 19, 2001 the Chairman of the National Council, Mr. Kholod, did not consider the Settlement Agreement as binding, stating that the National Council is a *\"constitutional independent body, not subordinated to the government\"* and *\"that the government cannot adopt any act influencing the development of TV/radio broadcasting in Ukraine\".* Claimant has produced a transcript of the meeting, which Mr. Lemire prepared at that time44. Mr. Kholod\u2019s statement has not been challenged and the Tribunal is inclined to accept it as true. But what is undeniable is that one day after the meeting, the National Council approved an official decision recognizing Gala\u2019s priority position to receive the frequencies promised in the Settlement Agreement.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-101.\n\n184.\n\nNot only that, on March 22, 2001, i.e. only two days after this decision in favour of Gala, the National Council announced a new tender for frequencies, which included eight of the 11 frequencies mentioned in Clause 13(b) of the Settlement Agreement. In meetings in June and July 2001, the National Council decided to allocate seven of these frequencies to Gala; and the seven broadcasting licences were issued on September 18, 2001. Two other licences had already been issued on October 9, 1997 (long before the Settlement Agreement)45. Two remained pending - those in Dniepropetrovsk and Lviv -and were eventually issued on March 26 and October 9, 2002, respectively.\n\nIn Kryviy Rog and Uzhgorod.\n\n185.\n\nThe frequency in Dniepropetrovsk was put to tender on July 26, 2001, but because of accumulated workload of the National Council, it was not approved until March 2002. As regards Lviv, the frequency under discussion had already been granted to other radio companies, whose rights had first to be cancelled, and this justifies the delay.\n\n186.\n\nSumming up, in the end the National Council eventually granted to Gala all 11 broadcasting licences mentioned in Clause 13(b). Two had been issued before the Settlement Agreement, seven were issued in September 2001, one in March 2002 and the final one in October 2002.\n\n187.\n\nClaimant alleges that this late performance of the Settlement Agreement is tantamount to non-performance, and asks the Tribunal to declare that Ukraine has breached the terms of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nUkraine\u2019s alleged breach\n------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that there were delays in the issuance of the broadcasting licences by the National Council. But this is not really the point under discussion. What is relevant is whether Ukraine has breached the terms of the Settlement Agreement and for this, it is paramount to look at the actual text of what was agreed.\n\n189.\n\nAs noted above, Clause 13(b) of the Settlement Agreement does not establish obligations of the National Council, nor does it create a deadline for the National Council to issue its decisions. It simply states Ukraine\u2019s commitment to *\"assist for the positive consideration of this issue at the National Council\".*\n\n190.\n\nThe difference between Clause 13(a) and Clause 13(b) is striking. The first Clause creates a best efforts obligation to issue the State Committee\u2019s authorization within an agreed time frame. It proves that when the parties wanted to establish obligations and time limits, they were perfectly capable of doing so in clear and unambiguous terms. Clause 13(b), however, lacks any specific time frame, and only refers to Ukraine\u2019s commitment to *\"assist\"* Mr. Lemire in his endeavours vis-\u00e0-vis the National Council.\n\n191.\n\nDid Ukraine comply with its part of the bargain, assisting Claimant *\"within the limits of its power\"* and *\"in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation\"* in the obtaining of the licences?\n\n192.\n\nThe record suggests that the Ministry of the Economy\u2019s assistance was helpful indeed. Mr. Lemire wrote for the first time complaining on February 22, 2001. The National Council\u2019s initial attitude had been rather negative, as proven by the meeting with its Chairman. This was overcome, undoubtedly because of advice from the Government. On March 19, 2001 - one month after Mr. Lemire\u2019s first complaint - the National Council reversed its opinion and acknowledged Claimant\u2019s rights to the licences. Two days later, the first tender was launched and nine of the 11 frequencies were duly awarded by September 2001 - not bad a record for an agency which had been recently reconstituted. The two other licences were delayed - one just because of bureaucratic delays, the other because of underlying problems with the entitlement to the frequency.\n\n193.\n\nThe facts proven in this arbitration do not substantiate Claimant\u2019s claim that Ukraine failed to assist Claimant in his endeavour to obtain the broadcasting licences required from the National Council. In hindsight, it is unfortunate for Claimant that he only bargained for such a weak commitment from the counterparty. But the terms agreed are *lex contractus,* and it is those terms which the Tribunal must apply.\n\n**F) Allocation of Low-Powered Frequencies**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe power of frequencies allocated to Gala ranged from 0.1 to 4kW with an average of 1.17 kW. On all its frequencies combined, Gala reaches some 22% of the population of Ukraine.\n\n195.\n\nClaimant complains that the power of the frequencies allocated to Gala under the Settlement Agreement was far below his legitimate expectations and failed to meet his business purposes46. He alleges that in the negotiations of the Settlement Agreement as well as in pre-settlement communications with the National Council and other agencies of Respondent, much higher powers had been envisaged. In this respect, Claimant refers to correspondence between the National Council and State Inspection of Electric Communication of July 18 and October 18, 1995 which suggested the availability of much higher powered frequencies for Claimant47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibits CM-1 and CM-2.\n\n196.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement, in any case, is silent on the power of frequencies sought by Claimant. Nor does it include any reference to Claimant\u2019s business purposes - e.g. his desire to cover the whole territory of Ukraine - from which a minimum power could be inferred. While the preliminary negotiations between the parties and the purpose of the Settlement Agreement are to be taken into account in determining the common intent of the parties (per Clauses 23(a) and (d) of the Settlement Agreement), Clause 27 provides that the Settlement Agreement *\"constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings...\".* This disqualifies prior correspondence and negotiations as a basis of obligations deliberately not mentioned in the Settlement Agreement. Claimant can therefore not derive a claim from pre-Settlement Agreement correspondence and negotiations.\n\n197.\n\nFurthermore, the power of the frequencies awarded to Claimant was not abnormally low. Claimant has acknowledged that the average power of the frequencies allocated to him matched that of frequencies allocated to major competitors48. If Mr. Lemire felt that he was entitled to higher powered frequencies than his competitors, he would have had to include such entitlement in the Settlement Agreement. That has not happened.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.12.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, Claimant learned the actual power of the frequencies allocated to him by September 1, 2000, when Gala received the licences from the State Committee. He thus knew the power of the frequencies on September 20, 2000 when the Settlement Agreement was recorded as the 2000 Award. Claimant did not seek any amendment of the Settlement Agreement, nor did he reserve his position.\n\n199.\n\nThe power of the frequencies was specified in the announcement of the tenders by the National Council. Claimant applied for these frequencies without complaining about the power. Thus, even if Claimant had been entitled to higher powered frequencies (which in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion does not derive from the Settlement Agreement), he acquiesced with the power of the allocated frequencies. To claim now that this lack of power gives rise to a breach of the Settlement Agreement denotes inconsistent behaviour, contrary to Article 1.8 of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles.\n\n**G) Allocation of Four Frequencies Which Were Contested by the Armed Forces of Ukraine**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nClaimant finally complains that four of the frequencies allocated to him were contested by the Armed Forces of Ukraine49. In Claimant\u2019s opinion, Ukraine failed to de-conflict with the Army the frequencies awarded to Gala.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.13.\n\n201.\n\nRespondent counters that the contests were prompted by Gala itself, which decided to change the location of its radio transmitters in three cities, by a distance of between 4.6 and 1.87 km, and increased the height of its antenna from 55 to 70 m in another50. These changes require the approval of the State Centre, which issues such authorization only with the approval by the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces. What happened in these four cases is that the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces refused to approve the changes. Refusal however did not mean that the frequencies became contested - Gala Radio in fact continued to broadcast on them. Gala was required only to change the locations and/or parameters of the transmitters following the recommendations of the State Centre, and obtained all required permits in 2008.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 271.\n\n202.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the difficulties incurred by Claimant with regard to these four frequencies do not constitute a breach of Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n203.\n\nUnder Clause 13(b) paragraph 2 Ukraine is bound to *\"assist\"* Claimant *\"within the limits of its powers\"* to obtain the authorization of the National Council. There is no express reference to the Armed Forces. But in an interpretation based on good faith, and bearing in mind that Clause 24 creates an obligation for each party to cooperate with the other, the Tribunal is prepared to admit that the obligation to assist should be extended to encompass not only the National Council, but also any other institution controlled by Ukraine. Consequently, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Respondent was under an obligation to assist Mr. Lemire in obtaining or maintaining the necessary authorizations from the Armed Forces.\n\n204.\n\nDid Respondent fail to do so?\n\n205.\n\nClaimant has argued that a senior manager of the State Centre admitted that Ukraine failed to de-conflict the four frequencies and apologized for the mistake by stating that *\"unfortunately we failed to coordinate with military department51\".* An analysis of the evidence submitted by Claimant to prove this allegation does not support the conclusion. Claimant has presented a summary, prepared by his own officers, of a meeting on February 21, 2005 with Mr. Zhebrodski, a senior manager of the State Centre52. The exact exchange of words which, in accordance with that summary, took place between the officer of Gala and Mr. Zhebrodski is the following:\n\n*\"[...] Dima: Also, we have had interferences for the past few months and we have uncertain situation with Donetsk...*\n\n*Zhebrodski: I am going to call military department in Donetsk, what happened is back in 2000 we had a straight order to give you licence in Donetsk (107.2 fm) and unfortunately we failed to coordinate it with military dpt. Are they complaining?*\n\n*Dima: No complaints so far, we have been working there for quite awhile.*\n\n*Zhebrodski: Good. I am sure we can sort it out at least I am gonna try [...]\".*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-143.\n\n206.\n\nThe exchange of words between the officer of Gala and the senior manager of the Centre does not prove a breach by Ukraine of its obligation to assist Claimant. Quite to the contrary. What it shows is that, up to that moment (2005), the Army had not complained about the changes in Donetsk, that Gala was broadcasting there and that the State Centre was offering its help if a problem with the Army eventually arises. The problem afterwards materialized, and it was then, it appears, satisfactorily settled by 2008.\n\n207.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the problems which Gala encountered with the Army regarding four frequencies, which were eventually solved, do not amount to a default by Ukraine of its obligations under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n208.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, the Tribunal concludes that, although Claimant encountered difficulties and delays in the obtaining of the frequencies expected under the Settlement Agreement, and although the end result may not have satisfied all the expectations harboured by Claimant, Respondent did not breach any of the obligations it had assumed in that Agreement.\n\n**VII. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize Claimant\u2019s general allegations (VII. 1), then Respondent\u2019s (VII.2), before analyzing and deciding the claims:\n\n- in first instance, the Tribunal will study the alleged violation of the FET standard in the awarding of frequencies, and will effectively come to the conclusion that certain actions of Respondent are not compatible with this standard (VII.3);\n\n- a second section will be devoted to the alleged continuous harassment of Claimant, and his request for moral damages (VII.4);\n\n- in the next sections the Tribunal will reject Claimant\u2019s additional allegations, regarding an alleged violation of the FET standard by other actions performed by Ukraine (VII. 5) and the applicability of the \"Umbrella Clause\" (VII.6); and\n\n- the Tribunal will then decide whether the 2006 amendment of the LTR and in particular the 50% Ukrainian music requirement amounts to a violation of the BIT (VII.7), and finally devote a short section to other allegations submitted by Claimant (VII. 8).\n\n**VII. 1. Claimant\u2019s General Allegations**\n------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nClaimant\u2019s starting point is that, after having made the investment in Gala Radio, he had a legitimate expectation that he would be authorized to increase the size and audience of his radio company, and to establish three radio networks in Ukraine aimed at three different age groups. This plan had been discussed with the National Council members and encouraged by them.\n\n211.\n\nAs evidence of his expectations, Claimant especially relies on three documents, namely:\n\n- a letter of July 18, 1995 from the Chairman of the National Council to the Chairman of the State Inspection on Electric Communications. This letter advises that *\"the National Council... considers possibility to issue a licence to radio company GALA\"* and requests the State Inspection *\"to consider a possibility to give the company the frequency channels\"* in 13 cities *\"up to\"* a specified power53;\n\n- a letter from the Chairman of the State Inspection on Electronic Communications to Claimant of October 18, 1995 informing of the availability of high power frequencies in the cities concerned and advising that the requisite permissions would be issued after Gala had received the pertinent broadcasting licences from the National Council54; and\n\n- a \"Plan of Measures\" negotiated between Claimant and the National Council in 1997 envisaging the allocation of frequencies to set up the Gala networks.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-1; the English translation by mistake does not include the words *\"up to\"* which appear in the Ukrainian original.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-2.\n\n212.\n\nThe main thrust of Claimant\u2019s submission is that his legitimate expectations were thwarted by Ukraine\u2019s actions in violation of the BIT. Claimant divides his allegations regarding these violations into four different sections55.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 64.\n\n213.\n\n(i): In the first section, Claimant argues that Ukraine has violated the FET standard applicable to protected investments, and the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory measures, established in Article II.3. (a) and (b) of the BIT. Respondent\u2019s specific actions, which have resulted in violation, can be divided in two groups:\n\n- denial by the National Council of nearly 300 applications for frequencies submitted by Gala or Energy (a company also owned by Claimant), and illegal award of frequencies to companies other than Gala, during the period when the National Council was not operative; and\n\n- other actions performed by Respondent, like failure to correct the interferences on Gala\u2019s 100 FM frequency, failure of the National Council to acknowledge its obligations under the Settlement Agreement; allocation of low powered frequencies to Gala; allocation of frequencies contested by the Army.\n\n214.\n\nOf the alleged violations, the first one, the systematic denial of applications, is by far the most important one. Claimant argues that the Ukrainian legal procedure for allocation of frequencies is in itself unfair, inequitable, discriminatory and arbitrary. The procedure was moreover applied by the National Council in an unfair, inequitable and discriminatory fashion. It was tainted by interferences from other political organs of Respondent, including the President of Ukraine. The National Council\u2019s aim was to preclude Gala from establishing multiple networks with national coverage. And it was successful in achieving this.\n\n215.\n\nClaimant specifically refers to six tenders for frequencies, from 2002 through 2008, which in his view demonstrate Respondent\u2019s practice in breach of the BIT.\n\n216.\n\n(ii): In the second section, Claimant asserts that Respondent is submitting Gala to continuous harassment, in violation of Article II.3 (a) of the BIT. Respondent attempted to rely on the \"founder\" principle to deny Gala Radio an extension of its licence beyond the expiry date of September 18, 2008. Furthermore, there have been concerted efforts by the National Council to force Claimant out of the radio industry through ongoing actions of harassment and the issuance of unlawful warnings.\n\n217.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that Respondent, after a few years of costly and lengthy litigation, ultimately cancelled the warnings, renewed the broadcasting licence and applied the correct fee. But this eventual acceptance of Claimant\u2019s rights does not provide Ukraine with immunity from paying damages. Claimant alleges that Respondent\u2019s harassment since the Award has inflicted significant moral harm for which Respondent should be held liable in an amount of three million USD.\n\n218.\n\n(iii): In the third section, Claimant submits that the 50% local music requirement in the LTR implies a violation of Article II.6 of the BIT, namely of the prohibition to *\"impose performance requirements... which specify that goods and services must be purchased locally, or which impose any other similar requirements\"*. Respondent has tried to justify the local music requirement on public policy grounds. In Claimant\u2019s opinion, the argument can at best justify an expropriation subject to the payment of the corresponding damages. The abnormal high level of the requirement and its abrupt incorporation caused Claimant to suffer loss for 2008 of advertising revenue, and such loss will continue until the expiration of the licence in 2015.\n\n219.\n\n(iv): Finally, Claimant submits that, as a consequence of the Umbrella Clause contained in Article II.3 (c) of the BIT, all the contractual breaches of the Settlement Agreement have also been transformed into violations of the BIT, which entitle Claimant to be compensated for the damages suffered.\n\n**VII.2. Respondent\u2019s General Allegations**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nRespondent submits that its legal procedures for tenders involving radio frequencies are consistent with the requirements of the BIT; the implementation of these procedures also conforms with the BIT requirements.\n\n221.\n\nThe procedures for allocation of frequencies meet the standards of due process and procedural fairness, including the right to be heard. Frequencies are awarded by means of tenders announced in the press; prospective participants may submit their applications within one month of the notice. Such applications must include an information package. Thereafter, the National Council reviews the requests applying statutory criteria, and especially valuing the programming content proposed by each applicant. The meetings of the National Council are public, and the National Council holds briefings with representatives of the radio industry. A frequency is awarded to a radio company if the application receives at least five of the votes of the eight members of the National Council. All decisions of the National Council are published on the National Council\u2019s official website. Finally, the decisions of the National Council are subject to judicial review.\n\n222.\n\nThe National Council is an independent body. Each of its members exercises his or her judgment without external pressure, and Claimant\u2019s allegations of corruption and undue pressure are unsupported by any evidence. Furthermore, the LTR was amended in 2006, and since then members may be removed from their functions only by a joint decision from the Parliament and the President. Claimant\u2019s allegations of political influence were not corroborated during the hearing. No member of the National Council has been impeached, no one associated with the National Council has been prosecuted for corruption, and no one has been convicted of wrongdoing.\n\n223.\n\nGala Radio was treated in a fair and equitable manner and was not discriminated against during the tenders. Claimant lost the four tenders which were analyzed during the hearing for objective reasons. There is no proof of unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment against Claimant.\n\n224.\n\nRespondent also addresses Claimant\u2019s allegations regarding harassment. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, the procedure and practice of monitoring radio companies is consistent with Ukraine\u2019s obligations under the BIT. The results of any inspection are reviewed in a meeting of the National Council, where its members listen to a presentation of one of them, review a set of documents, listen to oral explanations from the representative of the radio company, and only thereafter take a decision.\n\n225.\n\nAll radio stations are continuously monitored. Those inspected and sanctioned are publicly mentioned in the Annual Report of the National Council. None of Gala\u2019s inspections was conducted in an unfair, inequitable or abusive manner. The warning issued against Gala on October 5, 2005 sanctioned Gala\u2019s refusal to produce documents and materials required for the inspection. This warning was successfully challenged before the Ukrainian Courts. On November 23, 2005 a second warning was issued for violating the quota of broadcasting in Ukrainian, the law on advertising, and the terms of its licence. The second warning was also cancelled by the Kiev Court. In May 2006 a third inspection was carried out. Since Gala had significantly improved its business activities, compared to previous periods, the National Council decided not to issue a third warning. There were subsequent inspections in March and June 2008, but they did not lead to any sanction, although Gala Radio admitted that by accident it had committed violations of the election legislation.\n\n226.\n\nOther radio companies have also been inspected and received warnings - some of them three, and the National Council has started court proceedings in five cases in order to cancel the broadcasting licence.\n\n227.\n\nThe 2006 LTR had been debated by members of Parliament for more than three years, and its purpose was to make Ukrainian Law comply with European requirements. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, the LTR must be considered as part of the State\u2019s legitimate right to organize broadcasting. The 50% Ukrainian music requirement, which requires that either the author, the composer and/or the performer of 50% of the music broadcast be Ukrainian, was neither abrupt, nor excessive nor unfair. Gala Radio signed in August 2006 a Memorandum proposed by the National Council for the progressive implementation of the 50% requirement, and Gala Radio and all its competitors are presently in compliance. There is no link between the 50% Ukrainian music quota and the decline in Gala Radio\u2019s ratings.\n\n228.\n\nRespondent finally makes three additional allegations:\n\n- Claimant did not behave as a diligent businessman;\n\n- Gala Radio did not take advantage of available remedies; and\n\n- Claimant abused his position as a foreign investor.\n\n**VII.3. Claimant\u2019s First Allegation: the Violation of the FET Standard in the Awarding of Frequencies**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe main thrust of Claimant\u2019s allegation is that Ukraine has failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to its investment in Gala, and subjected it to arbitrary or discriminatory measures. Ukraine rejects both allegations. The Tribunal will analyze this dispute - which is the basic issue submitted to its adjudication - in a short introduction and three separate sections:\n\n- the first devoted to the concept of FET standard, as defined in the BIT (VII.3.2);\n\n- the second to the procedures for awarding frequencies under Ukrainian law (VII.3.3); and\n\n- the third to the facts surrounding Gala\u2019s applications for frequencies (VII.3.4).\n\n**VII.3.1. Introduction**\n-------------------------\n\nClaimant\n--------\n\n230.\n\nClaimant, Mr. Joseph Charles Lemire, is an American citizen residing in Ukraine. By profession, Mr. Lemire is a lawyer, although he also has experience in accounting. He is the owner and chairman of Gala, a closed joint stock company constituted in 1995 under the laws of Ukraine. His participation in Gala is held through another Ukrainian company, Mirakom. He initially purchased 30% of Gala, but since 2006 he indirectly owns 100% of the company56. The proven amount of his investment is 236,000 USD. There is circumstantial evidence that Mr. Lemire has made payments with his own monies on behalf of Gala. But the record of the actual amounts paid has not been produced, and Mr. Lemire\u2019s statement that the total exceeds 5,000,000 USD57 has not been locked up with hard evidence. The personal assets of Mr. Lemire and those of Gala appear to some extent commingled58.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 283, atl4.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 285, at 20 and p. 304, at 9.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 288, at 25.\n\nGala\n----\n\n231.\n\nGala is a company which since 1995 operates a contemporary music radio station. It holds a licence to broadcast on two frequencies in Kyiv and on 12 other frequencies in nine areas of Ukraine. Gala Radio applied for and received a licence recognizing its status as a national broadcaster on October 17, 200759. In the late 1990\u2019s, Gala ranked amongst the most popular radio stations in Ukraine. Claimant acknowledges that its market share has declined - and attributes this decline to Respondent\u2019s actions.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-153.\n\n232.\n\nGala has been a reasonably successful company. Its revenues have gone up from 600,000 USD in the year 2000 to 1,369,000 USD in the year 2007 (with a profit of 121,000 USD)60. As Respondent\u2019s expert witness says, *\"while being small business in a competitive market and risky environment, it is obvious that Gala has become a successful national radio station, and as investor, Joseph Charles Lemire has achieved reasonably good results and revenue growth61*\n\nEBS Expert Report, p. 6.\n\nEBS Expert Report, p. 5.\n\n233.\n\nOn a qualitative basis, Claimant has alleged and Respondent has accepted that Gala won the Radio Company of the year award for brand recognition in 1999, won an award for the best radio program on Olympic News from the Golden Pen competition organized by journalists and that four of the top 10 disk jockeys in Ukraine work for Gala, including the well-known DJ Pascha (the alias of Mr. Pavel Shylko), who testified in this arbitration62.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 117.\n\nMr. Lemire\u2019s relationship with the National Council\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nRespondent has insisted, throughout the procedure, that Mr. Lemire abused his position as foreign investor and harassed the National Council with rude, disrespectful and to some extent even aggressive conduct63. Respondent argues that Mr. Lemire has sent scores of hostile letters to the National Council, copying the former President of Ukraine, the current President of Ukraine, the Vice President of the United States, the US Ambassador and others. He also video-recorded meetings of the National Council.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, para. 83.\n\n235.\n\nThe relation between Mr. Lemire and the National Council was not always tense. At the outset of the investment, in 1995, the relationship seems to have been friendly, and the National Council supported Mr. Lemire\u2019s efforts to invest in the Ukrainian radio sector. Suddenly the relationship soured in 1996, for no obvious reason. Asked by the Tribunal why his relationships with the National Council became hostile, Mr. Lemire has declared under oath that the reason was that *\"at one point I was asked for a bribe and I said I would not pay64\".* No further evidence of this alleged request for bribes has been produced.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 309, at 3.\n\n236.\n\nWhat is undisputed is that in 1996 Gala Radio sued the National Council before the Ukrainian Courts, because Gala had been removed from the air by a decision of the National Council. On February 26, 1997, the Supreme Arbitration Court of Ukraine ruled in Gala\u2019s favor65. In 1997, Mr. Lemire initiated the First Arbitration against Ukraine, which eventually led to the Settlement Agreement and 2000 Award. In 2006 Gala challenged before the Ukrainian Courts, and again successfully, two decisions of the National Council to issue warnings66. Finally, Mr. Lemire of course started this arbitration, accusing the National Council of having treated him in *\"an unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory manner in breach of its BIT obligations*\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 166, at 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-50 and Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R- 353.\n\n237.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Lemire challenged a number of decisions of the National Council before the Ukrainian Courts and filed two successive investment arbitrations against Ukraine cannot have helped to improve the climate between Gala Radio, a company acting in a highly regulated and supervised legal environment, and the National Council, its regulator and supervisor. The existence of successive court actions may have been one of the reasons for deterioration of the relationship. The Tribunal is also convinced that on certain occasions, Mr. Lemire felt threatened, and that he was afraid that Gala would be taken off the air by the authorities. There were at least two incidents - the third inspection, which could have led to a third warning and revocation of the licence, and the difficulties in obtaining a renewal of Gala Radio\u2019s licence -where Mr. Lemire\u2019s reaction shows real worry. Mr. Lemire\u2019s tactics vis-\u00e0-vis Gala\u2019s regulator and supervisor may seem high handed and sometimes even aggressive, but they may have been the only method available to a small, private radio company in Ukraine owned by a foreigner, to draw attention to its situation.\n\nRespondent\n----------\n\n238.\n\nRespondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Ukraine. The actions and omissions on which Claimant bases his claims were carried out by the National Council, the State Centre and the State Committee, all of which are organs of Ukraine, for which under international law the Republic is responsible.\n\n239.\n\nAs Respondent has explained to the Tribunal, Ukraine became an independent State on August 24, 1991, and after independence its political, economic and legal systems underwent a substantial transformation67. Ukraine has acknowledged that in the initial years of independence, constant political battles and economic instability caused a lack of coordination in the activities of state bodies and hampered their ability to create an effective system of government.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 18.\n\n240.\n\nUkraine is an independent and sovereign state, governed by a Constitution, which entrusts to Parliament, elected by general democratic vote, the task of promulgating laws. The Arbitral Tribunal naturally respects the legislative function or the Ukrainian Parliament. It certainly is not the task of this Arbitral Tribunal, constituted under the ICSID Convention, to review or second-guess the rules which the representatives of the Ukrainian people have promulgated. The powers of this Tribunal are much more limited: they only encompass the authority to decide on a case-by-case basis whether Ukraine has violated certain guarantees, offered to American investors under the BIT, and to establish the appropriate remedies.\n\n241.\n\nThe respect for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty is reinforced by the sector in which Claimant made his investment: radio broadcasting. In all jurisdictions, Radio and TV are special sectors subject to specific regulation. There are two reasons for this:\n\n- first, radio frequencies are by technical nature scarce assets, and consequently the law must articulate systems for allocating licences to prospective bidders;\n\n- but there is also a second reason: when regulating private activity in the media sector, States can, and frequently do, take into consideration a number of legitimate public policy issues; thus, media companies can be subject to specific regulation and supervision in order to guarantee transparency, political and linguistic pluralism, protection of children or minorities and other similar factors.\n\n242.\n\nThe exceptional character of media companies, and specifically of radio broadcasting companies, is accepted in the BIT itself. In its Annex, both the United States and Ukraine reserve the right to make or maintain limited exceptions to the national treatment principle (provided for in Article II. 1 of the BIT) with regard to radio broadcasting stations. The exception does not affect the principles which are being pleaded by Claimant in this procedure, but it proves the special sensitivity towards the media shown by both States when approving the BIT.\n\n**VII.3.2. The FET Standard as Defined in the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to determine the general scope and meaning of the FET standard defined in the BIT.\n\n244.\n\nArticle II.3 (a) and (b) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"3. *(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable* *treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.*\n\n*(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party\".*\n\n245.\n\nThe origin of Article II.3 (a) and (b) can be traced to the 1992 and 1994 US Model BIT, which proposed the following wording:\n\n*\"Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded* *treatment less than that required by international law. Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments. Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments \"68.*\n\nAs quoted in I. Tudor, \"The Fair and Equitable Standard in the International Law of Foreign Investment\" (2008) p. 28.\n\n246.\n\nArticle II.3 of the BIT was thus taken literally from the US Model BIT which was in force at the time when the BIT was negotiated, with only the addition of the phrase referring to judicial review. It is a rule of Delphic economy of language, which manages in just three sentences to formulate a series of wide ranging principles: FET standard, protection and security standard, international minimum standard and prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory measures.\n\n**A) Customary International Law Minimum Standard and FET Standard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nA classic debate in investment arbitration law is whether the FET standard established by bilateral or multilateral investment treaties coincides with or differs from the international minimum standard of protection for aliens imposed by customary international law.\n\n248.\n\nThe starting point of this debate is the very definition of the international minimum standard - a question which is fraught with difficulties69. For claims arising from administrative or legislative acts of Governments - which are the type of claims typically submitted in investment disputes - the historic leading case seems to be *Roberts70,* issued by the United States - Mexico General Claims Commission in 1926, which defined the minimum treatment as that required *\"in accordance with ordinary standards of civilization\".* Mr. Roberts, a US citizen, had been imprisoned in Mexico in what he held to be inhumane conditions. Mexico had argued that Mexicans were held in identical conditions. And the Tribunal decided:\n\n*\"Facts with respect to equality of treatment of aliens and nationals may be important in determining the merits of a complaint of mistreatment of an alien. But such equality is not the ultimate test of the propriety of the acts of authorities in the light of international law. That test is, broadly speaking, whether aliens are treated in accordance with ordinary standards of civilization. We do not hesitate to say that the treatment of Roberts was such as to warrant an indemnity on the ground of cruel and inhumane imprisonment\".*\n\nFor a *status quaestionis* see Paulsson/Petrochilos: \"Neer-ly Misled?\" ICSID Review: Foreign Investment Law Journal (2007), vol.22.2, pp. 242-257.\n\n*Harry Roberts (U.S.A.) v. United Mexican States;* November 2, 1926; U.N. Report of International Arbitral Awards, IV, p. 71.\n\n249.\n\n*Roberts* is understood to stand for the propositions that a certain treatment may give rise to international responsibility notwithstanding that it affects citizens and aliens alike, and that administrative and legislative actions may amount to a violation of the customary minimum treatment even if the State did not act in bad faith or with willful neglect of duty71.\n\nWhile for claims based on denial of justice, aggravating circumstances like outrage, bad faith, willful neglect of duty or other egregious behavior are required; see *L.F.H. and P.E. Neer (U.S.A) v. United Mexican States',* October 7, 1926; U.N. Report of International Arbitral Awards, IV, p. 60\n\n250.\n\nThe relationship between FET and customary minimum standard has been the subject of much debate, especially in NAFTA based arbitrations, and has led the NAFTA Free Trade Commission to issue a binding interpretation on July 31, 2001. According to this interpretation:\n\n\"2. *Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law*\n\n*1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.*\n\n*2. The concept of fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and full protection and security \u2019 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that, which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens. [...]\".*\n\n251.\n\nThe same proposition, that the FET standard should be reduced to the customary international law minimum standard, was afterwards adopted in the new 2004 US Model BIT. Article 5 of this model provides72:\n\n*\"Article 5: Minimum Standard of Treatment73*\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n*2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments\".*\n\nQuoted in I. Tudor, \"The Fair and Equitable Standard in the International Law of Foreign Investment\" (2008) p. 57.\n\nFootnote omitted.\n\n252.\n\nIs this principle of assimilation between customary minimum standard and FET standard also applicable to the US - Ukraine BIT?\n\n253.\n\nThe answer must be in the negative. The BIT was adopted in 1996, and was based on the standard drafting then proposed by the US. The words used are clear, and do not leave room for doubt: *\"Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment... and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law\".* What the US and Ukraine agreed when they executed the BIT, was that the international customary minimum standard should not operate as a ceiling, but rather as a floor. Investments protected by the BIT should in any case be awarded the level of protection offered by customary international law. But this level of protection could and should be transcended if the FET standard provided the investor with a superior set of rights74.\n\nIn agreement: I. Tudor, \"The Fair and Equitable Standard in the International Law of Foreign Investment\" (2008) p. 29.\n\n254.\n\nIn view of the drafting of Article II.3 of the BIT, the Tribunal finds that actions or omissions of the Parties may qualify as unfair and inequitable, even if they do not amount to an outrage, to willful neglect of duty, egregious insufficiency of State actions, or even in subjective bad faith.\n\n255.\n\nThis leads to the next question: what is the exact meaning of the FET standard acknowledged by the BIT?\n\n**B) Meaning of Article II.3 of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe words used by the Article II.3. are the following: *\"Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment [...] Neither party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments\".*\n\n257.\n\nThese general principles require interpretation in order to give them specific content and this interpretation must comply with the requirements of Article 31.1. of the Vienna Convention - it must be done *\"in good faith in accordance with the* *ordinary meaning* *to be given to the terms of the treaty* *in their context* *and in the light of its* *object and purpose* *75\".*\n\nEmphasis added.\n\na) Ordinary meaning\n-------------------\n\n258.\n\nAn inquiry into the ordinary meaning of the expression \"fair and equitable treatment\" does not clarify the meaning of the concept. \"Fair and equitable treatment\" is a term of art, and any effort to decipher the ordinary meaning of the words used only leads to analogous terms of almost equal vagueness.\n\n259.\n\nThe literal reading of Article II.3 of the BIT is more helpful. In accordance with the words used, Ukraine is assuming a positive and a negative obligation: the positive is to accord FET to the protected foreign investments, and the negative is to abstain from arbitrary or discriminatory measures affecting such investments. Any arbitrary or discriminatory measure, by definition, fails to be fair and equitable. Thus, any violation of subsection (b) seems *ipso iure* to also constitute a violation of subsection (a). The reverse is not true, though. An action or inaction of a State may fall short of fairness and equity without being discriminatory or arbitrary76. The prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory measures is thus an example of possible violations of the FET standard.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No.ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability of 3 October 2006, para. 162.\n\n260.\n\nThe literal interpretation also shows that for a measure to violate the BIT it is sufficient if it is either arbitrary or discriminatory; it need not be both.\n\n261.\n\nDiscrimination, in the words of pertinent precedents, requires more than different treatment. To amount to discrimination, a case must be treated differently from similar cases without justification77; a measure must be *\"discriminatory and expose[s] the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice78\";* or a measure must *\"target[ed] Claimant\u2019s investments specifically as foreign investments79*\n\n*Saluka Investments BV v.

[it] shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety81\"',* or *\"wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety82\",* or conduct which *\"manifestly violate[s] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination83\".* Professor Schreuer has defined (and the Tribunal in *EDF v. Romania84* has accepted) as \"arbitrary\":\n\n*\"a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;*\n\n*b. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;*\n\n*c. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;*\n\n*d. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure\"*\n\n*Ronald S.

Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award of 8 October 2009, para. 303; Professor Schreuer acted as expert and his opinion was quoted and accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n263.\n\nSumming up, the underlying notion of arbitrariness is that prejudice, preference or bias is substituted for the rule of law.\n\nb) Context\n----------\n\n264.\n\nWords used in treaties must be interpreted through their context. The context of Article II.3 is to be found in the Preamble of the BIT, in which the contracting parties state *\"that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment...\".* The FET standard is thus closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations - actions or omissions by Ukraine are contrary to the FET standard if they frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations on which the investor relied at the time when he made the investment85.\n\nThe relationship between FET and legitimate expectations has been established in a number of decisions: *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic PCA,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award of. March 17, 2006, para. 302 which then quotes *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. United Mexican States**, CME v. Czech Republic* and *Waste Management v. United Mexican States**.*\n\nLegitimate expectations\n-----------------------\n\n265.\n\nWhich were the legitimate expectations of Claimant at the time he made his investment?\n\n266.\n\nIt must be recalled that when in 1995 Mr. Lemire made his first investment and acquired a controlling stake in Gala Radio, this was a small company in a nascent industry. Historically, before independence and political change, the radio industry in Ukraine had been in the hands of the State. In the mid 1990s the sector began to be privatized, a first Law on TV and Radio having been approved on December 21, 1993. All these factors had a bearing on Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n267.\n\nOn a general level, Claimant could expect a regulatory system for the broadcasting industry which was to be consistent, transparent, fair, reasonable, and enforced without arbitrary or discriminatory decisions. It is true that Ukraine and the United States, when accepting the BIT, had reserved their right to make or maintain limited exceptions to the national treatment in the radio sector86. Under this exception, Ukraine could e.g., validly require that the founders of broadcasting companies be Ukrainian nationals. But Mr. Lemire could equally expect that, once he had been awarded the necessary administrative authorization to invest in the Ukrainian radio sector, there would be a level playing field, and the administrative measures would not be inequitable, unfair, arbitrary or discriminatory.\n\nSee Annex to BIT.\n\n268.\n\nAnd on a more specific and personal level, Mr. Lemire undoubtedly had the legitimate expectation that Gala, which at that time was only a local station in Kyiv, would be allowed to expand, in parallel with the growth of the private radio industry in Ukraine.\n\n269.\n\nThe actual level of anticipated expansion has been the object of much discussion by the parties. Mr. Lemire has submitted that his intention at that time was to create three radio networks, two in FM, and one in AM, centered around three different age groups87. Respondent has challenged this statement, and has referred to the absence of any formal business plan setting out the intended business structure.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 121, at 17.\n\n270.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the available evidence shows that what Mr. Lemire had in mind when he bought into Gala Radio in June 1995, was to convert Gala into a national broadcaster and to create a second AM channel. The idea to create a third radio network - called \"Energy\" - seems to have been an afterthought. At the time of the acquisition of Gala, Claimant must have approached the National Council, and asked whether a national licence for Gala and an AM licence could be obtained. The National Council reacted in positive terms, as proven by a letter addressed to the State Centre, in which the National Council states that it is *\"considering the possibility\"* of issuing to Gala licences for a nationwide FM channel and for a second AM Band, and enquires whether the frequencies would be available. There is no reference to a third channel88. The State Centre reacted positively89.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-2.\n\n271.\n\nRespondent has insisted that Claimant has not been able to produce a formal business plan90. That is true. But the Tribunal does not attach too much weight to this omission. Formal business plans are customary in sizeable investments in settled economic and business environments. None of these characteristics applied to Mr. Lemire\u2019s investment in Gala Radio: a small amount was involved and the situation of Ukraine was anything but settled.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 90.\n\nc) Object and purpose\n---------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe object and purpose of the BIT - the third interpretive criterion - is defined in its Preamble: the parties *\"desir[e] to promote greater economic cooperation between them, with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party\"* and recognize that the BIT *\"will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties\".* The main purpose of the BIT is thus the stimulation of foreign investment and of the accompanying flow of capital.\n\n273.\n\nBut this main purpose is not sought in the abstract; it is inserted in a wider context, the economic development for both signatory countries. Economic development is an objective which must benefit all, primarily national citizens and national companies, and secondarily foreign investors. Thus, the object and purpose of the Treaty is not to protect foreign investments *per se,* but as an aid to the development of the domestic economy. And local development requires that the preferential treatment of foreigners be balanced against the legitimate right of Ukraine to pass legislation and adopt measures for the protection of what as a sovereign it perceives to be its public interest.\n\n**C) Pursuit of Local Remedies**\n--------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nRespondent has submitted that Gala Radio, although it asserts a list of errors concerning the tenders, never challenged any of the decisions before the Ukrainian Courts91. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, Claimant should have taken advantage of the available local remedies that would have been capable of correcting the alleged administrative wrong. Claimant did so when confronted with the warnings issued by the National Council, and successfully challenged two decisions before the Ukrainian Courts. Respondent draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the *Generation Ukraine* award, which stressed the need for the investor to make a reasonable effort to obtain the legal correction of an administrative fault:\n\n*\"[...]In such instances, an international tribunal may deem that the failure to seek redress from national authorities disqualifies the international claim, not because there is a requirement of exhaustion of local remedies but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to expropriation is doubtful in the absence of a reasonable - not necessarily exhaustive - effort by the investor to obtain correction92\".*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 625.\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003, para. 20.30.\n\n275.\n\nThe question which the Tribunal must answer is whether, given the fact that Gala Radio has not challenged the decisions of the National Council, it is now precluded from presenting its claim in this arbitration.\n\n276.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis must be the text of the BIT. The BIT - unlike other Treaties - does not include any clause requiring the initiation or exhaustion of local remedies before the filing of an investment arbitration. Quite the contrary: Article II.3 deviates from the standard US Model BIT in only one point, the insertion of the following phrase:\n\n*\"[...] For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party\".*\n\n277.\n\nThe literal meaning of this phrase could not be clearer: even if a party has had (and has not exercised), or has exercised (with whichever outcome) the right to judicial review, such action or omission is irrelevant in an investment arbitration deciding whether the measure is arbitrary or discriminatory. The consequence is that in an arbitration under the US-Ukrainian BIT, the possibility to file a claim against a specific measure, is not burdened by any requirement to previously appeal to the national Courts.\n\n278.\n\nThis does not mean that an investor can come before an ICSID tribunal with any complaint, no matter how trivial, about any decision, no matter how routine, taken by any civil servant, no matter how modest his hierarchical place. In this case, however, the claim is raised against the conduct of the National Council, that is to say the highest regulatory organ for the broadcasting industry. On this basis, the Tribunal considers that there should be no impediment to Claimant seeking to hold Ukraine accountable for an alleged breach of the BIT.\n\n279.\n\nGiven the clear language of the BIT, the Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s submission that Claimant is precluded from pursuing his claims in the present arbitration, due to his failure to appeal the tender decisions of the National Council.\n\n*Generation Ukraine*\n--------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal would like to add that - even if Article II.3 of the BIT had lacked a specific reference to local remedies - the present case has significant differences with *Generation Ukraine**.* In *Generation Ukraine**,* the claim filed by Claimant was based on expropriation, and the appropriate level of compensation - a type of claim which could have been submitted to and decided by the local Courts. In the present arbitration, the situation is quite different: the claim is for damages arising from the violation of the BIT standards, and such claim can only be filed before an international arbitration tribunal.\n\n281.\n\nIt is true that under Article 30.4 of the LTR, Gala Radio would have had the opportunity to challenge the decisions of the National Council awarding frequencies to other companies. But those claims would only have succeeded in setting aside the National Council\u2019s decision, and forcing that the tender be repeated. Gala Radio would never be certain that in this repeat tender it would be successful. The practical result of an appeal against a tender decision of the National Council is very limited - if the procedure is unfair or the administrative body biased, it could again decide to grant the licence to another contender and not to Gala. The effect is quite different from that of an appeal against a warning - in this case the Court\u2019s decision provokes the immediate setting aside of the measure.\n\n282.\n\nThe test proposed by *Generation Ukraine* is based on reasonableness. Claimant is only required to put in a reasonable effort to obtain correction of the wrong decision. In the circumstances of the present case, it would have been unreasonable to require Claimant to have fought in the Ukrainian Courts the National Council\u2019s decisions adjudicating frequencies.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal is not thereby suggesting that a breach occurs if the National Council makes a decision which is different from the one the arbitrators would have made if they were the regulators. The arbitrators are not superior regulators; they do not substitute their judgment for that of national bodies applying national laws. The international tribunal\u2019s sole duty is to consider whether there has been a treaty violation. A claim that a regulatory decision is materially wrong will not suffice. It must be proven that the State organ acted in an arbitrary or capricious way. A regulatory organ charged with the attribution of licences on a competitive basis plainly violates essential notions of fairness if it refuses to consider the information provided by a qualified applicant, or if it engages in favouritism. And the State itself breaches its obligations under the treaty if it exercises undue influence over the decisionmaking of regulatory bodies.\n\n**D) Summary**\n--------------\n\n284.\n\nThe FET standard defined in the BIT is an autonomous treaty standard, whose precise meaning must be established on a case-by-case basis. It requires an action or omission by the State which violates a certain threshold of propriety, causing harm to the investor, and with a causal link between action or omission and harm. The threshold must be defined by the Tribunal, on the basis of the wording of Article II.3 of the BIT, and bearing in mind a number of factors, including among others the following:\n\n- whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework;\n\n- whether the State made specific representations to the investor;\n\n- whether due process has been denied to the investor;\n\n- whether there is an absence of transparency in the legal procedure or in the actions of the State;\n\n- whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad faith conduct by the host State;\n\n- whether any of the actions of the State can be labeled as arbitrary, discriminatory or inconsistent.\n\n285.\n\nThe evaluation of the State\u2019s action cannot be performed in the abstract and only with a view of protecting the investor\u2019s rights. The Tribunal must also balance other legally relevant interests, and take into consideration a number of countervailing factors, before it can establish that a violation of the FET standard, which merits compensation, has actually occurred:\n\n- the State\u2019s sovereign right to pass legislation and to adopt decisions for the protection of its public interests, especially if they do not provoke a disproportionate impact on foreign investors;\n\n- the legitimate expectations of the investor, at the time he made his investment;\n\n- the investor\u2019s duty to perform an investigation before effecting the investment;\n\n- the investor\u2019s conduct in the host country.\n\n286.\n\nOnce the scope and meaning of the FET standard has been defined in the abstract, the Tribunal must establish the facts and decide whether they constitute a violation of such standard. This will be achieved by reviewing the legal procedure created by Ukrainian law for the awarding of licences in the broadcasting sector (VI.3.3), then by analyzing in detail the facts surrounding the allocation of frequencies which affected Gala (VI.3.4).\n\n**VII.3.3. Procedure for the Awarding of Licences in the Broadcasting Sector Under Ukrainian Law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nTwo fundamental laws regulate the Ukrainian radio sector:\n\n- the Law on National Television and Radio Council of Ukraine (\"LNC\"), originally issued on September 30, 199893, amended on a number of occasions, the last on January 12, 2006; the scope of this law is the designation and scope of responsibilities of the National Council;\n\n- the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting (\"LTR\"), originally issued on December 21, 1993, amended significantly a number of times, lastly on March 1, 200694, and which provides the general rules regarding the functioning of radio and TV in Ukraine.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-2; the Tribunal used Claimant\u2019s translation, to which Respondent has not made any objection.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-3; the Tribunal will quote from the translation prepared by Claimant, to which Respondent has made no objection.\n\n**A) The National Council**\n---------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe LNC establishes the National Council as a *\"constitutional permanent collegiate agency95\".* Its activities *\"shall be based upon the principles of legality, independence, impartiality, transparency...96\".* The eight members of the National Council are appointed in parity by the President and the Parliament respectively, for five-year terms with the possibility of a single reappointment97. Until 2006, the President and the Parliament could at any time disqualify any of their appointees from office. That was no empty threat: on February 2, 2004 the Parliament\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Speech and Information approved a resolution, recommending that Parliament carry out a *\"credibility impeachment\"* of all the members of the National Council98.\n\nArticle 1 of the LNC.\n\nArticle 3.1 of the LNC.\n\nArticle 4 of the LNC.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-31.\n\n289.\n\nSince 2006 the situation has improved because the LNC has been amended, and the National Council *in toto* can be dismissed only upon a vote of no confidence carried by Parliament and confirmed by the President99.\n\nArticle 16.5 of the LNC.\n\n290.\n\nThe National Council derives its status and mandate directly from a constituent law. Its independence and impartiality is expressly guaranteed by that law. Formally, it thus is independent. The appointment of independent regulators by Parliament and/or the Head of State follows wide-spread practice. Before 2006, the power of the President and the Parliament, respectively, to remove their appointees from office indeed represented a threat to Council members\u2019 independence. With the requirement of a concurring decision of both the President and the Parliament for removing the Council *in toto* from office, a safeguard against undue political pressure was introduced.\n\n291.\n\nThe level of political interference with the decisions of the National Council is difficult to gauge from the outside. The only incident which is proven beyond any doubt is the interference of the President of Ukraine with the tender of October 19, 2005, which was awarded to the bidder mentioned in the President\u2019s letter to the National Council (which will be analyzed in detail below). During the hearing, Mr. Lyasovsky, a member of the National Council, was directly asked whether National Council members follow the instructions of the political establishment. His answer, under oath, was the following100:\n\n*\"Well, we\u2019re very accustomed to hearing this kind of language, I\u2019ll be honest and frank. Yes, there have been - there are attempts at putting pressure on the council. However, due to the specifics of how the council is formed, such attempts are ineffective, especially since recently, since amendments were made, passed in 2006. Indeed, we now are an independent body and we\u2019re not subject, or rather we\u2019re immune to pressure\".*\n\nMr. Lyasovsky, Hearing Transcript 2 p. 73, at 24.\n\n292.\n\nThe answer acknowledges that pressure has been exercised on the National Council, but expresses the contention that since 2006 - when the LNC was amended and the Council was given a higher level of independence - the situation has been improving.\n\n**B) The Administrative Procedure for the Issuances of Licences**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe LTR is an extensive law, comprising 75 articles, regulating the creation, licensing, functioning, supervision and sanctioning of companies operating in the TV and radio sectors. Section III of the Law, as it now stands, is devoted to the rules governing the tender procedure and the issuance of broadcasting licences.\n\n294.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the system for granting radio licences has gone through four phases:\n\n- in a first phase, between 1993 and 1995, licences were issued by the National Council under Article 14 of the 1993 LTR, upon individual application of persons interested in setting up a radio station;\n\n- after 1995, radio frequencies were awarded by means of tender announced in the press101;\n\n- the third phase began on December 15, 1998, when the National Council became inoperative because it ceased to have five duly designated members, and consequently could not validly carry decisions; during this interregnum, radio frequencies were awarded directly by the State Committee, in clear violation of the LTR102. The situation was solved in June 2000, when the National Council regained all its members, and a first tender in accordance with the LTR was then organized on January 1, 2001;\n\n- since January 2001, licences have all been awarded by way of tenders supervised by the National Council.\n\nMr. Petrenko, Hearing Transcript 4, p. 81, at 25.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-11, letter of National Council member S. Aksenenko to the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine.\n\n295.\n\nThe LTR contains detailed rules with regard to the organization of tenders. The decision to launch a tender for new frequencies is adopted by the National Council, then published in the press. Prospective bidders have a one-month period to present their applications, which must include information required by Article 24 of the LTR. Applications are then reviewed by the individual members of the National Council. The criteria of review are now those established in Article 25.14 of the LTR:\n\n*\"While considering the applications the National Council shall prefer TV/radio organization that:*\n\n*a) is capable to fulfill the licence conditions to the best extent;*\n\n*b) prefers socially important programs (informational, social and political, children, etc.), satisfies informational needs of national minorities and secures freedom of speech;*\n\n*c) has an advantage in financial and economical as well as professional and technical capabilities for TV/radio broadcasting;\"*\n\n296.\n\nThe system for deciding the winner of the tender is simple: the National Council holds a formal meeting, the various applications for each frequency are presented, each member of the National Council expresses a vote and the licence is awarded to the applicant supported by at least five members of the National Council103. If no applicant reaches this threshold, the frequency is not awarded, although it may be put again to tender on a future occasion.\n\nThis is not controversial; see Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 350.\n\n297.\n\nThe voting system gives rise to three different issues:\n\na) Publicity of the vote\n------------------------\n\n298.\n\nThe first is the publicity of the vote.\n\n299.\n\nThe LTR contains no provision regarding the formal requirements of the National Council\u2019s decision. Practices seem to have developed. It is undisputed that in an initial phase, the votes would be cast in a private meeting of the Council, behind closed doors, and that there was no transparency of how each member of the National Council had voted. The parties have debated when this phase ended. Claimant has submitted that the change occurred in 1995104; while Respondent\u2019s position is that this happened in 2000105. The evidence submitted by Respondent in order to support its position are minutes of National Council meetings which took place from December 24, 2003 onwards. These minutes list representatives of participating radio companies as \"invited persons\" present during the discussions.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 104.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 511.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that from the end of 2003 onwards, the practice of the National Council has been to \"invite\" interested parties to attend its meetings. This constitutes a significant improvement in the transparency of the decision procedure.\n\nb) Reasoning of the vote\n------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe second issue is the reasoning underlying the votes.\n\n302.\n\nThe LTR does not require that the votes of each member of the National Council, or the National Council\u2019s decision as such, be reasoned. This derives clearly from the drafting of Article 25 of the LTR.\n\n303.\n\nIn paragraph 8 of this provision, the law specifically establishes that if the National Council is to exclude a person from participating in a tender, such decision must be *\"reasoned\u2019.* In the documents presented in this arbitration there is at least one example of a decision excluding a participant in the tender, and that decision is duly reasoned106.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-350, regarding the exclusion of NBCU from two tenders.\n\n304.\n\nThe situation is different as regards decision for the awarding of frequencies. Paragraph 13 of the same article describes the procedure for awarding the licence to the winner of the tender:\n\n*\"A decision on the winner of a tender and on broadcast licence issuance shall be made by the National Council within a 30-day period after application period is finished\".*\n\n305.\n\nIt is very telling that for this decision of awarding frequencies the law omits the requirement that it be *\"reasoned\" -* a requirement which the same article of the Law specifically requires for exclusion of applicants.\n\n306.\n\nThe administrative practice of the National Council when awarding frequencies adhered to the principle established in the LTR. Respondent has presented a great number of minutes of decisions taken by the National Council. These minutes simply state in favour of whom each member is casting his vote. And if a participant received five votes, the frequency was awarded to him. The minutes do not include any discussion among the members or the reasoning of the decision.\n\n307.\n\nThe evidence presented in this arbitration does not indicate that before the National Council\u2019s meeting, either the administrative staff of the Council, or its members, prepared a reasoned and researched report with a valuation and ranking of the applications submitted. This is surprising, since Article 25.14 of the LTR orders that in considering the application, the National Council *\"shall prefer\"* radio organizations that offer socially important programs, satisfy minorities, secure freedom of speech, have better financial resources or professional or technical capabilities. The evidence submitted seems to show that the National Council made no formal effort to measure to what extent each application complied with the requirements of the Law107.\n\nRespondent has submitted that in order to help members of the National Council, an \"informational passport\" for each region of Ukraine was prepared by National Council Staff (Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 347); but this passport did not include any valuation of the various applications submitted.\n\n308.\n\nRespondent has acknowledged that *\"the members of the National Council are not obliged by the existing legislation to explain the details of their reasoning during the voting process108\".* But Respondent has added that in practice the members of the National Council did explain their reasoning at the meeting, during debates with the candidates and during the discussions with other members of the National Council, and after the meetings at briefings with the press. In the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal, these informal explanations, which started in 2004, although certainly a step forward, do not off-set the absence of any reasoning justifying the vote of each Council Member, and the corporate decision of the National Council as a body.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 512.\n\n309.\n\nThe absence of reasoning of the decision represents a significant weakness in the administrative procedure for the issuance of licences.\n\n310.\n\nThus, a participant who has lost cannot ascertain why his application was rejected, how he was ranked with regard to other participants, and what he could do to improve his chances to be successful in the next bidding.\n\n311.\n\nThe absence of reasoning also jeopardizes the possibilities of public scrutiny and of judicial review. A Court cannot judge the reasonableness of the National Council\u2019s decision to award the tender to one participant or the other, if there is no formal explanation of the reasons which prompted the decision. Absence of reasoning *de facto* reduces the causes of judicial review to procedural irregularities during the tender.\n\n312.\n\nIn April 2007, three Deputies from the parliamentary majority proposed to Parliament the creation of an Investigating Committee centred on the activities of the National Council, including the *\"transparency and publicity of broadcasting licences issuing and renewal109\".* Although the proposal of the three Deputies may also have had political motivations, the mere fact that it was presented - it is unclear from the record if the Committee was actually set up110 - proves the existence of significant unease with the degree of transparency and publicity of the procedure for awarding broadcasting licences.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-86.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 71.3, Claimant submits that it was created; in Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 32 and Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 170, the assertion is that it was proposed.\n\nc) Lack of knowledge of ultimate owners\n---------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nA third characteristic of the system for allocation of frequencies is that participants were under no obligations to disclose the ultimate owners of their companies. While the direct controlling owners of companies bidding for frequencies were registered with the National Council, the owners of the owners were not. The Council members, who deposed as witnesses, when asked on several occasions by counsel to Claimant and by the Tribunal, were not able to provide any information regarding the beneficial owners of the radio companies to whom they had awarded significant numbers of licences111.\n\nMr. Lyasovski, Hearing Transcript 2, p. 52, at 17; Mr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript 3, p. 13, at 1; Mr. Kurus, Hearing Transcript 4, p. 7.\n\n314.\n\nPolitically influential individuals are thus able to beneficially own radio stations, which participate in tenders for new frequencies, and to hide behind \"ownership chains\", so that their interest in the decision remains undisclosed. This lack of transparency clearly represents a shortcoming of the system. The LTR does not require information about ultimate owners, and the National Council apparently never asked any of the participants to disclose the names of their controlling shareholders. This is especially troubling, since the legal criteria which National Council should apply when selecting the winner must include freedom of speech and financial and economic capability of the applicants - criteria difficult to apply if there is no transparency regarding beneficial owners of radio stations. It also makes it difficult for the public -and for judicial bodies - to determine whether there has been undue influence.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal has already stated its respect for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and for Ukraine\u2019s right to promulgate the laws which its Parliament deems are best suited to further the Nation\u2019s public interest. The powers of this Tribunal are limited to judging whether Respondent has acted in ways that affect Claimant and breach the FET standard enshrined in the BIT. But in order to value specific measures, the Tribunal must analyze the general legal framework within which specific conduct took place. That analysis has revealed that the procedure presents some shortcomings, which in essence affect:\n\n- the independence of members of the National Council;\n\n- the existence of an interregnum, during which licences were awarded without tender procedure;\n\n- the absence of formal valuation of the applications for licences against clearly established criteria;\n\n- the absence of reasoning for National Council decisions, whether collectively or for individual votes; and\n\n- the lack of transparency of ultimate owners of radio companies.\n\n316.\n\nWhile none of the above features alone stigmatizes the entire tender process as arbitrary, there is a risk that the shortcomings may end up mutually reinforcing each other. Members of the National Council, by virtue of the designation system, tend to have political affiliations and interests. Deficient disclosure and transparency requirements ease the misuse of discretionary powers by Council members to accommodate political or personal interests. In sum, the procedure for allocating frequencies by the National Council is fraught with shortcomings that facilitate arbitrary decision making.\n\n317.\n\nA final note is important: Ukraine gained its independence only in 1991 and still is in the process of developing its institutional framework. During this formative period, legal imperfections are to be expected. Ukrainian law has improved, and after the 2006 amendments of the LTR, a significant number of weaknesses have been ameliorated.\n\n**VII.3.4 Gala\u2019s Applications for Additional Frequencies**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nIn the preceding section the Tribunal has concluded that the tender procedure for the issuance of licences presents certain shortcomings, which although falling short of disqualifying the entire system as arbitrary, remain relevant for the assessment of the National Council\u2019s measures. In this section the Tribunal will establish the facts surrounding Gala\u2019s applications for additional frequencies, and will decide whether the actions or omissions of Respondent amount to a violation of the FET standard guaranteed in the BIT to protected investors.\n\n**A) Overview of Gala\u2019s Participation in Tenders for Additional Frequencies**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nIt is undisputed that between 2001 and 2007 Gala Radio participated in a great number of tenders for broadcasting licences, additional to those that were awarded to Gala pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The exact number of frequencies for which Gala applied, however, is debated. Claimant states that the number of applications amounts to more than 200 for Gala, plus 100 more for Energy (a second chain of radio stations which Claimant tried to create)112. Respondent accepts 180 applications for Gala113 and 71 for Energy114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, para. 167; see also Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-99 with a list of the applications.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R 344-A.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 434 and 453.\n\n320.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that all those applications were unsuccessful - with one exception: Claimant was awarded the frequency in Chechelnik, a village of 5,000 inhabitants without any satellite receiver (which implies that the station cannot be linked to Gala\u2019s network). It is undisputed that the business relevance of this frequency is minimal. Claimant adds that the National Council\u2019s decision to reward Gala\u2019s continuing efforts with the awarding of this local frequency in a remote, unconnected village was intended to rub salt in the wound115.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 168.\n\nClaimant\u2019s argument\n-------------------\n\n321.\n\nClaimant argues that Gala\u2019s dismal record in receiving frequencies stands in stark contrast with that of its competitors, all controlled by powerful and well-connected personalities. Claimant gives the following examples116:\n\n- Radio Era applied for 93 frequencies and was awarded 38 (41% success rate); the station is allegedly owned by Mr. Derkach, who is said to be a supporter of the current President of Ukraine;\n\n- Hit Radio applied for 139 frequencies and was awarded 42 (30%); Claimant alleges that it is owned by Mr. Bagrayev, a Deputy (i.e. member of Parliament) and member of the National Council 2000-2002;\n\n- NBM Radio applied for 205 frequencies and was awarded 56 (27%); it is allegedly owned by Mr. Poroshenko, also an ally of the current President;\n\n- Russkoe Radio applied for 111 and was awarded 31 (28%); allegedly also owned by Mr. Bagrayev117.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-129.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 106.\n\n322.\n\nClaimant has produced circumstantial evidence to substantiate that these radio chains are actually owned by the above-mentioned individuals118. During the hearing, Claimant asked the members of the National Council who deposed, to clarify the ownership structure of these radio stations. They all declined, in essence arguing that information regarding beneficial owners is not available to the National Council. The Tribunal also notes that Respondent has not produced any evidence contradicting Claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibits CM-105, CM-116 and CM-124 and Mr. Lemire\u2019s Witness Statement, para. 123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments\n----------------------\n\n323.\n\nRespondent\u2019s main argument is that Claimant cannot assert a breach of the BIT while remaining at a \"macro-statistical\" level. Each tender is different from the next, and each applicant is different from the rest. As regards the statistics themselves, Respondent submits that of the 180 frequencies Gala applied for, only 68 were destined for broadcasting a music format that could be similar to Gala Radio\u2019s program concept119. Respondent also states that in some tenders which it eventually lost, Gala received the favourable votes of some of the Council members - but it never received the five votes necessary for the awarding of the licence.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 438.\n\n324.\n\nThe main thrust of Respondent\u2019s argument is that Gala Radio did not win tenders because it *\"is an average radio station120\"* and that it is not at the top level of the overall Ukrainian broadcasting market. Its programming concept is no longer as popular and innovative as it used to be. This would, in Respondent\u2019s assertion, justify the National Council\u2019s decision to deny new licences to Gala.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 447.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that mere statistics are insufficient for maintaining a claim for violation of the FET standard. But on the other side, statistics do give an overview of how the facts have developed and may provide valuable insight into patterns of behaviour.\n\n326.\n\nIf an impartial bystander looks at the gross, macro-statistical numbers, an impact cannot be avoided. In six years Gala Radio, a radio company in good standing, although it tried insistently, has not been able to obtain additional frequencies (except in a small village in rural Ukraine and except for the frequencies allocated pursuant to the Settlement Agreement). Whether one takes Claimant\u2019s numbers (200 applications for all types of frequencies) or Respondent\u2019s (68 applications for music format frequencies similar to Gala\u2019s) is really irrelevant. Respondent\u2019s number is in fact even more striking, because it refers to cases where the National Council denied Gala an additional frequency for the type of programming it was already offering, and with good success.\n\n327.\n\nIt is undisputed that Gala\u2019s main competitors - Era, Hit, NMB, Russkoe -were much more successful than Gala: they received between 38 and 56 frequencies. Respondent has tried to justify this differential treatment stating that Gala *\"is an average radio station\",* that its programming concept is stale and that other competitors offer better broadcasting.\n\n328.\n\nThe problem with Respondent\u2019s argument is that, since the National Council does not reason or explain its decisions, it is totally impossible for a third party (be it a local judge or this Tribunal) to verify whether Gala\u2019s applications were rejected because its programming concept was worse than that of its competitors (as Respondent now submits), or due to some other cause, and whether this cause was good, arbitrary or discriminatory.\n\n329.\n\nA suspicion in any case remains: if Gala, as Respondent readily admits, *\"is an average radio station\",* the natural consequence would seem to be that Gala should have had an average success rate in its tenders. And the record shows that it had a success rate which was much below average.\n\n330.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal feels that the macro-statistical analysis cannot provide conclusive evidence that Respondent has violated the FET standard; but the overall numbers, the absence of any reasonable explanation, the strikingly different success rates of Gala and of its competitors, the impossibility of verifying the reasons why Gala was rejected, are all factors which cast doubts on the decisions of the National Council.\n\n331.\n\nIn order to substantiate these doubts, it is necessary that the Tribunal analyze each of the tenders in particular. This will be done in the next sections.\n\n**B) The Tender of October 19, 2005 and the Interference of the President of Ukraine**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUndisputed facts\n----------------\n\n332.\n\nOn July 2004 the National Council announced a tender for 15 frequencies, with the special condition that the channel thus created be used solely for \"informational broadcasting\". Radio channels which exclusively or predominantly broadcast music, like Gala or Kiss, are of limited political relevance. Informational channels, however, are politically more sensitive, since they represent important elements for the formation of public opinion.\n\n333.\n\nIt is an undisputed fact that on July 20, 2004, i.e. four days after the announcement of the tender, the President of Ukraine sent a \"Doruchennya\" to Mr. Shevchenko, the Chairman of the National Council, which literally stated as follows121:\n\n*\"DORUCHENNYA OF THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT*\n\n*To: O. SHEVCHENKO O. GAJDUK*\n\n*In accordance with the set procedure to consider the matter relating to the allocation of the frequency resource to \"Radio Era\" and \"Radio Kokhannya\"*\n\n*Signed V YUSCHENKO\".*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-45.\n\n334.\n\nThe \"Doruchennya\" included a further paragraph, addressed to top officials of the Ukrainian Government and the City of Kiev, asking for support for the activities of TRC \"Era\" and \"Radio Era\".\n\n335.\n\nRadio Era was an already existing talk radio, broadcasting informational programs. Claimant has alleged that Radio Era (and Radio Kokhannya) are widely reported to be owned by Mr. Derkach, a political ally and supporter of the current President of the Ukraine.\n\n336.\n\nThere has been some discussion about the precise translation of the word \"Doruchennya\". During the hearing the Chairman of the National Council Mr. Shevchenko was questioned regarding the precise meaning, and it was agreed that the best English translation would be \"instruction\", not \"order\"122.\n\nMr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript 3, p. 161, at 19; Claimant has accepted the translation; see Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, fn. 271.\n\n337.\n\nThe \"Instruction\" was followed up by a letter sent on August 2, 2005, in which the \"First Deputy State Secretary of Ukraine\" asked Chairman Shevchenko to *\"inform the Secretariat of the President of Ukraine of status of the task commissioned by the Head of the State123*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-108.\n\n338.\n\nThe record shows no letter from either Mr. Shevchenko or the National Council reacting either to the \"Instruction\" or to the Secretariat\u2019s reminder.\n\n339.\n\nOn October 19, 2005 the National Council decided to award the 15 frequencies on tender to Radio Era. It is undisputed that during the discussion which led to the Council\u2019s decision, a deputy of the Ukrainian Parliament called Derkach attended the meeting. Radio Kokhannya was later on awarded 12 frequencies more.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position\n-------------------\n\n340.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, Gala lost the tender to Radio Era due to the President\u2019s intervention and then later due to the physical presence of a Parliamentary Deputy at the tender meeting itself. The tender was procedurally improper, and the outcome was unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory. As a consequence of these measures, Claimant lost the opportunity to establish a separate talk radio format in an FM format that solely focused on news, informational programs, culture, education and sports124.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 92.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position\n---------------------\n\n341.\n\nRespondent asserts125 that the channel was awarded to Radio Era in view of the latter\u2019s supremacy in information broadcasting. The message of the President, in Respondent\u2019s view, did not constitute an order. Deputy Derkach does not own Radio Era and did not intervene in the National Council\u2019s deliberation. Thus, no undue influence was exercised on the National Council\u2019s tender decision.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 398.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n342.\n\nThe National Council was established by the LNC as a *\"constitutional permanent collegiate agency\";* and its activities *\"shall be based on the principles of legality, independence, impartiality, transparency...\"* (Articles 1 and 3 of the LNC). Decisions on the allocation of radio frequencies in particular are to be made in accordance with a tender process and tender evaluation criteria prescribed by law (see Article 25 of the LTR). Independence and impartiality of National Council members from other State bodies is pivotal to the integrity of the system.\n\n343.\n\nAny interference by a State body in the statutory tender process and the supposedly independent and impartial evaluation of tenders must therefore be considered as violating both the LNC and the LTR. This applies especially to any interference by the President, who appoints and reappoints half of the members of the National Council. It must also be remembered that at the time of the Instruction, members of the National Council could be removed by a decision of the President.\n\n344.\n\nTaken literally, the \"Instruction\" of the President only states that the Chairman of the National Council shall *\"in accordance with the set procedure [...] consider the matter relating to the allocation of the frequency resource to \"Radio Era\" and \"Radio Kokhannya\".* Respondent, supported by the deposition of Messrs. Shevchenko and Kurus, tries to depict the message as a routine call by the President on the National Council to do its job.\n\n345.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have to decide whether the message qualified as a Presidential order which must be obeyed. As noted before, it is sufficient if it constituted an interference with the independent and impartial decisionmaking process of the National Council, i.e. an indication of the President\u2019s expectations with respect to the pertinent decisions.\n\nImpact of the \"Instruction\"\n---------------------------\n\n346.\n\nDid the \"Instruction\" from the President amount to interference?\n\n347.\n\nRespondent submits that the \"Instruction\" should be construed exclusively on the basis of its plain language, and that it amounts to no more than an admonition to the National Council to do its job. No explanation has, however, been given why the National Council needs such an admonition. In the hearings of the present case, National Council members Shevchenko and Kurus could not refer to any similar action of the President, before or after this incident. Its singularity draws attention to the Presidential message and heightens its potential to influence decision making.\n\n348.\n\nMoreover, the message was written in the context of an instruction to other State officials to *\"remove obstacles\"* to Radio Era\u2019s activities and *\"report on the measures taken\"* within seven days. The different language used for addressing these officials, who do not enjoy independence guaranteed by law, and the National Council Chairman, respectively, shows the President\u2019s awareness of the National Council\u2019s independence. Yet, it also reflects the President\u2019s standing in support of Radio Era.\n\n349.\n\nAn additional factor to be borne in mind is that within two weeks of the Presidential \"Instruction\", but before the pertinent tender decision, the Secretariat enquired on the status of the *\"task commissioned\"* by the President. This letter is a clear indication of the President\u2019s support of Radio Era\u2019s offer and his expectation that his message would be duly taken into account in the process.\n\n350.\n\nIn these circumstances, the attendance at the decisive National Council meeting on October 19, 2005 by Deputy Derkach is clearly more than a routine participation of a deputy in a Council meeting. It appears as a demonstration of vigilance, intended to remind Council members that their decisions are watched.\n\nDeputy Derkach\n--------------\n\n351.\n\nIt has proven impossible for the Tribunal to ascertain whether Mr. Derkach actually owns or is somehow connected to Era Radio, as alleged by Claimant. Specifically asked by the Tribunal, Chairman Shevchenko could not confirm whether Mr. Derkach was the owner of Era Radio, nor could he give any information regarding the person or persons who controlled this radio station126. It is highly implausible that the Chairman of the National Council, who had been twice elected as a Parliamentary Deputy, who had received an \"Instruction\" from the President to consider Era\u2019s application favourably, and who voted in favour of awarding Era the licences to strengthening it as a leading broadcaster in Ukraine, should remain completely unaware of the ownership structure of this company.\n\nMr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript 3, p. 172.\n\n352.\n\nIn any case, for present purposes it suffices to record that, as documented by Claimant, Mr. Derkach has been reported in the media as being associated with Era Radio127, so that his presence at the National Council meeting must have been perceived as a supporter of this radio station. It can also remain open whether he has expressed his support by his body language, as maintained by Claimant. His mere attendance at this meeting in conjunction with his publicly reported association with Radio Era constitutes an action in support of this applicant.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibits CM 105 and CM 124; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 81.\n\nRespondent\u2019s counter-argument\n-----------------------------\n\n353.\n\nRespondent has asserted that the President\u2019s \"Instruction\" was inconsequential, because the channel of frequencies in question had been reserved for informational broadcasting and Radio Era was the national champion in this market segment. Even Claimant concedes that according to a market survey (the so-called \"SIREX Report\") Radio Era was the national leader on information broadcasting, with an established track record, while Gala intended to set up a new \"talk format radio network\" in order to satisfy the tender condition. Claimant adds, however, that in accordance with the SIREX Report Gala was number two (after Radio Era) in news broadcasting, and Radio Era\u2019s closest competitor128.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 91.\n\n354.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is again confronted with the impossibility of reviewing the reasons underlying the National Council\u2019s decision. A decision in favour of the established leader in the relevant field over a newcomer may under certain circumstances be appropriate. But Article 25.14 (b) of the LTR also orders the National Council to take into account the objective of *\"secur[ing] freedom of speech\".* Since Radio Era already had a radio network, pluralism could arguably be better served if the new channel was awarded to a different company. Gala had a realistic prospect of winning this tender against Radio Era, and such opportunity was taken away by the Presidential interference.\n\n355.\n\nThe President\u2019s \"Instruction\" referred not only to the tender applications of Radio Era, but also to those of Radio Kokhannya. It is undisputed that radio Kokhannya received 12 frequencies from July 2005 through January 2006129, in tenders in which Gala also participated.\n\nSee Mr. Lyasovski, Hearing Transcript 2, p. 81, at 23.\n\nDecision\n--------\n\n356.\n\nIn light of the aforementioned circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the President\u2019s \"Instruction\" amounted to interference with the independent and impartial decision of the National Council in favour of two of Claimant\u2019s competitors - Radio Era and Radio Kokhannya. It thus constituted a violation of applicable Ukrainian legislation, namely the LNC and LTR, which meets the *Saluka* test, since it *\"manifestly violate[s] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination \"* and thus amounts to an *\"arbitrary or discriminatory measure\"* within the meaning of Article II.3 (b) of the BIT. Furthermore, the apparently politically motivated preference for one competitor represents a discrimination against Claimant, who was applying in the same tender processes for the same frequencies.\n\n357.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal determines that when the National Council at the meeting of October 19, 2005 granted 15 frequencies for an information broadcasting channel to Radio Era, and subsequently awarded 12 frequencies to Radio Kokannya, such decisions violated the FET standard established by Art II.3 of the BIT.\n\n**C) The Tender of May 26, 2004 for an AM Frequency**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nIn May 2004 Gala applied for an AM frequency for Kiev, together with two competitors (Odessa Legal Academy and Charity Public Fund Radio). In the National Council meeting on May 26, 2004, the two competitors received each four votes and Gala secured one vote. As no application was supported by the requisite five votes, the National Council cancelled this tender, convened a new tender and awarded the frequency to NART TV.\n\n359.\n\nGala has been broadcasting on FM frequencies, which are appropriate for a program based fundamentally on music. The AM frequency is not suitable for music programs but only for talk and information programs.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position\n-------------------\n\n360.\n\nClaimant submits that with the AM frequency for which it was applying, Gala had intended to establish a new talk radio format130. Gala was the only qualified applicant in the May 26, 2004 tender, as its competitors lacked the necessary financial resources, radio experience and management capability. Notwithstanding Gala\u2019s qualifications, in an arbitrary and *discriminatory* decision the National Council decided not to award the frequency to Claimant, to retender it and to issue to NART TV, a company which had the correct political connections.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position\n---------------------\n\n361.\n\nRespondent contests Gala\u2019s assertion that it was the only qualified applicant in the May 26, 2004 tender131. In Respondent\u2019s view, Gala\u2019s competitors did have adequate resources and capabilities and Gala\u2019s failure can be explained by the lack of experience in informational talk programs and the perception by Council members that Gala was a music channel, without an information broadcasting concept.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 460.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established (see paragraph 271 *above)* that Mr. Lemire\u2019s expectations, when in 1995 he started his investments in the Ukrainian radio sector, were to create two channels, one in FM and the other in AM. The concepts for both programs would have been different: the FM channel would be based on music, the AM channel structured as a talk radio (because AM technically is not appropriate to broadcast music in a quality format).\n\n363.\n\nIn May 2006 the National Council put to tender an AM frequency in Kiev with 50 kW. This was an important tender, since AM frequencies are powerful and have an extensive range of coverage. Claimant has asserted132 that the frequency to be awarded actually covered a radius of 800 to 1000 km around Kyiv, i.e. the entire Ukrainian territory. Whoever won the tender for this frequency would be able to create a talk radio network, and broadcast news and information to the entire nation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 173.\n\n364.\n\nIt is undisputed that the only participants in the tender, in addition to Gala, were the Odessa Legal Academy (a University) and Charity Fund Radio. In its meeting of May 26, 2006 the National Council rejected all three applications. The reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision have never been made public. The only document in the file referring to the decision is the minutes (not the transcript) of the meeting of the National Council133. These minutes state only that the two other applicants received four votes each and Gala only one. There is no explanation of the decision, not even a summary of the presentations made by the applicants.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-79.\n\n365.\n\nDuring the hearing Chairman Schevchenko was expressly asked about the reasons underlying the National Council\u2019s decision. His explanation was very vague134:\n\n*\"But in this particular case, I must say that Gala Radio had fewer chances to become a winner of this contest because in many indicators was lagging behind the other contestants. Therefore the results of this voting is not accidental. I can explain to you my motives in voting this way, but it did not win this competition due to objective reasons\".*\n\nMr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript 3, p. 102, at 18.\n\n366.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial, Respondent justifies the National Council\u2019s decision by saying that the National Council was under the impression that Gala intended to broadcast music on the AM frequency, since Gala never presented to the National Council a different concept. As evidence of this assertion, Respondent only relies on a statement from Chairman Shevchenko. Claimant has submitted that it presented a talk radio proposal for the AM channel135. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Claimant\u2019s position is more plausible. It makes no business sense to broadcast a music program through an AM channel, and it seems unlikely that Mr. Lemire, an experienced radio operator, would be proposing such a business plan. Unfortunately, with the evidence presented by Respondent in this procedure, it is impossible to ascertain what Mr. Lemire actually told the National Council with regard to his plans. Mr. Lemire had the opportunity to speak at the Council\u2019s meeting, but Respondent has only produced the minutes, not the transcripts of this meeting.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 204.\n\n367.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal accepts as proven that Gala proposed to create a radio channel with talk radio format, and that for reasons which have not been explained, the National Council decided not to award the frequency to Claimant.\n\n368.\n\nThere is a second important factual element: the National Council decided, in the same meeting in which it rejected Gala\u2019s bid, to retender the same frequency (and this decision was carried unanimously). Only four months thereafter, in September 2004, the new tender was announced. The frequency was awarded on December 21, 2004 to NART TV, through a tender in which Gala did not participate. Claimant has asserted, and has presented circumstantial evidence136 proving that NART TV is associated with Mr. Tretwakov, the head of financial affairs in the campaign of President Yuschenko137. After obtaining the frequency, NART TV never used it. The National Council cancelled it and announced new tenders in 2007 and 2008, in which Gala did not participate.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-106.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 206.\n\nDecision\n--------\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal must decide whether the National Council\u2019s decision in May 26, 2004, denying Gala the AM frequency in Kyiv, and then immediately thereafter retendering the frequency, and awarding it in December 2004 to NART TV, violates the FET standard, by constituting an arbitrary or discriminatory measure. After due consideration, and not without some hesitation, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that there is a preponderance of evidence showing that the National Council\u2019s decisions indeed were arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n370.\n\nThe decisions of the National Council in May/December 2004, to reject Claimant\u2019s application and award the frequency to NART TV, must be viewed together with the decision of October 2005, denying Gala\u2019s application for a FM channel, and granting it to Radio Era. Both decisions affected talk radio channels devoted to information. In both, Claimant was denied the licence, and in both the licence was awarded to radio companies which - in accordance with circumstantial evidence - are owned by or associated with persons closely connected with the Government. The Tribunal has already decided that the October 2005 decision, in which 15 FM frequencies were granted to Radio Era, violated the FET standard. The same consideration must be extended to the decision of the National Council affecting the AM frequency and adopted in the period May/December 2004.\n\n371.\n\nThe *Saluka* test requires that the National Council\u2019s decision *\"manifestly violate[s] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination\".* The Tribunal finds that the National Council\u2019s decisions to award the AM frequency to NART TV and to deny it to Gala, meets these requirements. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal relies on the following factors:\n\n- Claimant\u2019s expectation that it would be awarded an AM licence and that it would be granted the possibility of setting up a talk radio channel;\n\n- the utter absence of any reasoning justifying why the National Council denied Claimant\u2019s request to be awarded the AM frequency in the initial tender;\n\n- the immediate decision of the National Council of retendering of the frequency, the announcement of the new tender four months thereafter and the subsequent issuance of the licence in favour of NART TV; and\n\n- the total lack of official information regarding the ultimate ownership of NART TV.\n\n372.\n\nThe findings of the Tribunal are not affected by Claimant\u2019s failure to participate in the second tender. In his deposition, Mr. Lemire explained that he had decided not to participate, because he deemed the effort futile138. The justification is reasonable. Given that Gala had been unsuccessful in the first tender, in which the other participants were weak and inexperienced operators, its chances of succeeding in the retender, in which a high profile company like NART TV participated, were likely nonexistent. The arbitrary and discriminatory nature of the Council\u2019s decisions arises from the rejection of Claimant\u2019s initial application, the immediate retender and the awarding of the channel to a politically influential applicant. Whether Claimant participated or not in the second tender is immaterial for the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\nMr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 273, at 25.\n\n**D) The Tender of February 6, 2008 With 40% Ukrainian Language Requirement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nThe tender of February 6, 2008 had a singular characteristic: the frequencies to be awarded were subject to an additional language requirement, namely that 40% of the program had to be in the Ukrainian language (this being in addition to the 50% Ukrainian music requirement under the 2006 LTR).\n\nClaimant\u2019s position\n-------------------\n\n374.\n\nClaimant submits that Gala competed with Kiss FM radio (the station whose ultimate owner allegedly is Mr. Bagrayev) for a number of frequencies in this tender139. At that time, Gala was broadcasting 37% of its program in Ukrainian language and thus fell 3% short of the tender condition. (Additionally Gala was meeting a second requirement introduced by the 2006 amendment to the LTR: in more than 50% of the music broadcast, the author, the composer or the performer were Ukrainian). When in the February 6, 2008 meeting of the National Council Mr. Lemire tried to explain how Gala would reach compliance with the 40% tender condition, he was cut off by Council member Kurus with the words: *\"It\u2019s very straightforward, I must say. According to the tender requirements, you must have no less than 40 percent\".* Mr. Lemire was not allowed to give any further explanation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 105.\n\n375.\n\nDuring the same meeting, a member of the National Council Secretariat reported the corresponding figures of Kiss: share of songs in Ukrainian language 1%, share of music by Ukrainian authors and performers 11%. Nevertheless, Kiss received three frequencies in the February 6, 2008 tender, and Gala received none.\n\n376.\n\nWhen National Council Chairman Shevchenko, in the December 8 - 12, 2008 hearings of the present case, was confronted with the transcript of the February 6, 2008 Council meeting, he explained that applicants were not required to comply before the tender with the 40% Ukrainian language condition, but that they had to demonstrate how they would meet this condition in the future *(\u2018what they had before the competition doesn\u2019t matter\").* In Claimant\u2019s interpretation, Mr. Shevchenko, who voted for Kiss FM, has admitted that his decision was pre-determined before the National Council meeting discussed the case.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position\n---------------------\n\n377.\n\nRespondent, without refuting Claimant\u2019s allegations in detail, argues that Mr. Shevchnenko\u2019s testimony as relied on by Claimant with respect to the February 8, 2008 tender *\"is of no probative value140\".* In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant confused Mr. Shevchenko by referring him to parts of the transcript relating to tenders other than those won by Kiss. Kiss FM had won the tender for the frequency 89.0 for Ternopil against 14 competitors, while Mr. Shevchenko had been referred to the discussions of the tenders for frequencies for Sumy and Ivano-Frankivsk. Notably the record of Kiss FM was reported in the context of Ivano-Frankivsk. As Mr. Shevchenko\u2019s testimony did not relate to the discussion of a tender won by Kiss FM, it cannot provide the basis for a comparison of the treatment of Kiss and Gala, respectively.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 433.\n\n378.\n\nRespondent does not, however, explicitly refute Claimant\u2019s allegation that all tenders discussed in the February 8, 2008 meeting were equally subject to the 40% Ukrainian language condition.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n379.\n\nSince there are divergencies between the parties regarding the facts, it is important that, as a preliminary step, the Tribunal establish as precisely as possible what actually happened.\n\n380.\n\nOn February 6, 2008 the National Council met, in order to award a large number of frequencies. Mr. Kurus, a member of the National Council, has deposed during the hearing that every frequency to be issued during that meeting was subject to the requirement that at least 40% of its programming be broadcast in Ukrainian141.\n\nMr. Kurus, Hearing Transcript 4, p 42, at 12; Mr. Shevchenko, when asked the same question, answered that there *\"could be different conditions for different frequencies\"* (Tr. 3, p. 138, 6); the Tribunal, after reviewing the transcript of the National Council meeting, coincides with Mr. Kurus\u2019 opinion, because references to the 40% requirement appear repeatedly when discussing various frequencies.\n\n381.\n\nAn official transcript of the meeting, prepared by the National Council itself, and consequently of high probative value142, reveals the following incidents:\n\n- Mr. Lemire was asked to speak during the tender for the frequencies in Sumy Oblast; although Gala had applied for a number of frequencies, the transcript shows that not all participants were invited to speak at each of the tenders; this tender was the only occasion when Mr. Lemire was authorized to speak; he explained that Gala Radio was complying with the 50% Ukrainian music requirement, and that the Ukrainian language percentage was 37%. He was interrupted by Mr. Kurus, a member of the National Council, who said: *\"It is very straight forward, I must say. According to the tender requirements you must have no less than 40%\";*\n\n- during the tender for Ivano-Frankivsk - in which Gala, Kiss and many other radio stations participated - President Shevchenko requested Mr. Sokur, a civil servant from the National Council, to provide the relevant statistics for Kiss (the official name of which is Utar TV and Radio Broadkasting UC); his answer was the following: *\"We have statistics for Utar TV and Radio Broadcasting UC as a competitor. And the figures are the worst. The share of music by national authors and performers is only 11% and the share of songs in Ukrainian 1%\";*\n\n- during the hearing, Chairman Shevchenko was cross examined with regard to this statement; he accepted that statistic prepared by National Council staff were correct143 and that if it were proven that Kiss was only broadcasting 11% Ukrainian music, this would constitute a violation of the law144; as regards the 1% Ukrainian language content, his explanation was that the percentage before the tender was irrelevant, what was important was that the bidder had a good program concept, and in future could reach the 40% threshold145.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibits R-351 and R-352.\n\nMr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript 3, p 81, at 16.\n\nMr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript 3, p. 89, at 11.\n\nMr. Shevchenko, Hearing Transcript. 3, p. 82, at 23\n\n382.\n\nThere has been some discussion among the parties regarding which radio company won which frequencies during the February 6, 2008 National Council meeting. It is undisputed that Kiss won the frequency for Ternopil with seven of the eight votes, because a copy of the official transcript clearly states so146. Claimant submits that Kiss won two additional tenders. Respondent has not provided clear evidence for this fact (because the transcript is not complete). It is undisputed that Gala was awarded no frequency.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-352, p. 10.\n\n383.\n\nAt the core of Claimant\u2019s grievance is the unequal treatment of Gala and Kiss with respect to the Ukrainian language tender condition. This condition applied to all tenders - including the tender for Temopil won by Kiss FM and all the tenders lost by Gala. But it was interpreted in a completely different way when applied to Gala as compared to Kiss. Respondent has tried to defend the National Council\u2019s record, stressing that the different interpretations were voiced in different tenders. The argument is unconvincing, because all tenders had the same basic requirement. And the fact remains that Kiss has been awarded (at least) a frequency, despite its nearly nil Ukrainian language record and its violation of the 50% Ukrainian music requirement (known to the National Council), while Gala has been disqualified on the basis of a much stronger record.\n\n384.\n\nAs noted before, a measure violates Article II.3 (b) of the BIT if it is either *\"discriminatory\"* or *\"arbitrary\".* It is readily apparent from the record that Gala and Kiss were treated differently in a similar case (i.e. on the same issue in the same tender proceeding, although not necessarily for the same frequency) without justification and, worse, in violation of applicable tender conditions. According to Article 25.14 (a) of the LTR, in its tender decisions the National Council must prefer applicants *\"capable to fulfil the licence conditions to the best extent\".* The Ukrainian language requirement was a highly relevant condition for all the tenders, and Gala\u2019s capability of fulfilling that condition was far superior to that of Kiss. While Kiss won at least a tender, Gala\u2019s record was pretextually discounted in order to exclude it from further consideration.\n\n385.\n\nAlthough not every violation of domestic law necessarily translates into an arbitrary or discriminatory measure under international law and a violation of the FET standard, in the Tribunal\u2019s view a blatant disregard of applicable tender rules, distorting fair competition among tender participants, does. In conclusion, the Tribunal considers that when the National Council at its meeting of February 6, 2008 decided to award at least a frequency to Kiss, and to deny all applications submitted by Gala, such decision violated the FET standard required by Article II.3 of the BIT.\n\n**E) The Tender of November 20, 2002 in Which Claimant Was the Only Applicant**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nOn November 20, 2002, the National Council denied Gala\u2019s application for a frequency for the city of Zhytomir, although Gala was the only applicant in this tender. The National Council\u2019s decision to reject Claimant\u2019s application for Zhytomir was not reasoned. Without providing further specifics, Claimant regards this decision as a violation of the FET standard147.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 118.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n387.\n\nClaimant is only alleging two circumstances in order to prove the arbitrary or discriminatory character of the National Council\u2019s decision to reject the Zhytomir application:\n\n- that Gala was the only applicant; and\n\n- that the decision was not reasoned.\n\nFactual situation\n-----------------\n\n388.\n\nBefore analyzing these circumstances in more detail, it is important to stress that the factual situation asserted by Claimant with respect to this tender was quite different from that pleaded and decided in section C). In the case of the AM channel, what happened was that Claimant\u2019s application was denied, and immediately thereafter the same frequency was assigned to a competitor, who apparently enjoyed privileged political connections. In the Zhytomir decision there is no allegation that the channel was afterwards retendered and awarded to a third party, in circumstances which could represent a violation of applicable rules. Nor does Claimant make any other indication of impropriety with regard to the actions of the National Council.\n\n389.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis must be whether the Zhytomir decision violated Ukrainian Law. In accordance with the practice of the National Council, which conforms with the LNC (Article 26.4), every allocation of a broadcasting licence required the affirmative vote of a majority of members, i.e. five. The same rule applied for tenders with only one participant. The single applicant had to secure five supportive votes in order to win the tender; otherwise the frequency was not allocated at all.\n\n390.\n\nThe lack of reasoning does not by itself constitute a violation of the LTR. As has already been explained (see paragraph 303 above), the LTR only requires reasoning for the National Council\u2019s decisions not to allow a company to participate in a tender (Article 25.8) - but not for the decision to award or deny the frequency (Article 25.13).\n\n391.\n\nAgainst these rules, Gala\u2019s position as the single applicant did not *ipso iure* entitle it to the Zhytomir frequency, but only to an unbiased consideration of the application in accordance with the statutory guidelines. The burden of proof that the decision was discriminatory or arbitrary (or otherwise violated the FET standard) lies with Claimant.\n\nThe National Council\u2019s decision\n-------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe National Council\u2019s decision denying Gala\u2019s application could never be considered discriminatory, because in this case no third party existed which benefited from it.\n\n393.\n\nIt could nevertheless be arbitrary.\n\n394.\n\nAfter due consideration, the Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s assertion, for want of sufficient evidence. Under Ukrainian law, the National Council was entitled to deny a licence, even if the applicant was the only entity applying, and Ukrainian law does not require that decisions be reasoned. The Tribunal has already indicated that the absence of reasoning represents a significant weakness in the administrative procedure for the issuance of licences (see paragraph 312 above). But this weakness does not imply *ipso iure* that all unreasoned decisions of the National Council are arbitrary. For a decision to be considered arbitrary, an additional element of lack of probity must have been pleaded and proven. Claimant has not succeeded to do so in the case of the Zhytomir frequency, and consequently Claimant\u2019s challenge to the National Council\u2019s decision fails.\n\n**F) The Tender of October 19, 2005 in Favour of NMB Radio**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nOn July 16, 2005 the National Council announced a tender for 29 frequencies grouped in a channel, which was to broadcast in Ukrainian only, with 100% Ukrainian language content. On October 19, 2005, NBM Radio was awarded this channel in a tender with 14 applicants, including Gala.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position\n-------------------\n\n396.\n\nAccording to Claimant, NBM Radio is owned by Mr. Poroshenko, a friend and political ally of the President. Claimant asserts148 that the outcome of the tender was pre-determined and that the channel of 29 frequencies was specifically calculated for NBM Radio, as evidenced by the fact that NBM Radio was the only one of the 14 applicants for this channel that had no overlap in its coverage with the frequencies allocated for tender. Claimant has also produced minutes of a meeting in Gala on February 21, 2003 where Mr. Zhebrodki, a manager of the State Centre, allegedly stated that the State Centre had received applications for frequencies from NBM and had *\"to do something about it, since Mr. Poroshenko has become a National Security Advisor149\".*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 98.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-143.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position\n---------------------\n\n397.\n\nRespondent pleads ignorance regarding Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s ownership of NBM Radio150 and submits that some 15 companies had participated in the tender (rather than 14 as alleged by Claimant), that these applications were discussed in meetings of the National Council during October 19 - 26, 2005, and that Radio NBM was awarded the channel because it best promised compliance with a key tender condition. This condition was to broadcast in Ukrainian language only with a 100% \"Ukrainian content\". While Claimant in the hearing of the National Council had criticized this tender condition, NBM Radio had promised full compliance and referred to its already superior record in this respect.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 408.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n398.\n\nClaimant submits that the October 19, 2005 National Council decision awarding 29 frequencies in favour of NMB Radio was arbitrary and discriminatory; the evidence presented is the following:\n\n- (i) NMB Radio is owned by Mr. Poroshenko, a close ally of the President;\n\n- (ii) the channel was specifically calculated to fit with NMB\u2019s present coverage;\n\n- (iii) a statement from Mr. Zhebrodki, Manager of the State Centre; and\n\n- (iv) a threat of prosecution from the National Council against Mr. Lemire.\n\n399.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyse each piece of evidence separately.\n\nValuation of the evidence\n-------------------------\n\n400.\n\n(i): As regards the ownership of NMB Radio, the Tribunal has again been unable to ascertain the ultimate owner because all the members of the National Council have deposed that they lack this information151. The deposition is so implausible, that the Tribunal - in the absence of any convincing evidence to the contrary - is prepared to accept the circumstantial evidence presented by Claimant and assume that Mr. Pereshenko is indeed the owner of NMB Radio. But even if this is assumed, and also that he is an ally of the President of Ukraine, these circumstances give rise to some suspicion but, in the absence of any further evidence of political interference, fall short of indicating a manipulation of the tender process.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 410.\n\n401.\n\n(ii) and (iii): Claimant further alleges that the channel of 29 frequencies had been specifically calculated for NBM Radio to enhance its national coverage. The only evidence submitted to prove this point is the statement from Mr. Zhebrodski (a manager of the State Centre)152. This statement was apparently made during a private meeting at Gala\u2019s premises held with certain officers of the company, identified simply as \"Natalie, Dima, Kid\". Neither Natalie, Dima nor Kid have appeared as witnesses in this arbitration or even submitted a witness statement. Then, after the meeting, some unidentified person prepared a transcript, translating what undoubtedly was spoken in Ukrainian into English. This two page English transcript is what has been presented, and there Mr. Zhebrodski is quoted as saying. *\"Right now we have applications from NBM and Channel 5 and we have to do something about it, since Poroshenko has become a National Security Advisor153*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 101.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-143.\n\n402.\n\nThis evidence is weak. There is no certainty that Mr. Zhebrodski actually used these words, that they were correctly recorded and then correctly translated into English. But even if *arguendo* the quotation is accepted as true, Mr. Zhebrodski only indicates that the prominent position of Mr. Pereshenko (not necessarily his relationship with the President) added some sense of urgency for the State Centre to perform its duties (i.e. to calculate frequencies in the presence of applications); it did not necessarily imply any manipulation.\n\n403.\n\n(iv): Finally, there is the alleged threat of prosecution by the National Council. What happened is that on September 15, 2005, Mr. Lemire sent a letter to the National Council, asking for a general suspension of tenders in view of allegations of corruption against the Ukrainian Government and also against the National Council154. As a reaction to this letter, on September 21, 2005, the National Council adopted a decision declaring Mr. Lemire\u2019s allegations *\"groundless and far-fetched\"* and *\"consider[ing] them as the tool of exerting pressure on the National Council management\"*, and informing the public of the *\"blackmail efforts\"* undertaken155.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 30 to Request of Arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-39.\n\n404.\n\nThe documentary record does not evidence any threat of prosecution from the National Council. What seemed to have happened is that Claimant sent a strongly worded letter (to use an understatement) to the National Council, with copies to the President and the Prime Minister and to the American Ambassador, and that the National Council reacted with a decision, also drafted in strong terms, rejecting the accusations and describing Claimant\u2019s behaviour as blackmail.\n\n405.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal considers that each piece of evidence submitted by Claimant, by itself, is not sufficient to support an allegation that the tender decision was arbitrary or discriminatory. The Tribunal has finally considered whether the evidence in the aggregate might establish conclusive evidence of a manipulation of the tender process, even if none of these circumstances did so by itself. Such a conclusion might be appropriate in the absence of a plausible explanation for the result of the tender decision. Thus, it is necessary that the Tribunal analyse the details of the National Council\u2019s decision.\n\nThe decision to award the frequencies\n-------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe record of this arbitration includes the transcript of the meeting of the National Council on October 19, 2006, in which both Gala and NBM (among various others) made presentations to defend their applications156. NMB spoke first, explaining that NBM Radio had started 10 years ago, and that it was the first radio station that conducted and continued to conduct the broadcasting exclusively in Ukrainian157. Gala, who spoke afterwards, accepted that the tender *\"is an entirely different format, not the format of Gala radio Company158 \"* and declared that it would comply with the requirements of the National Council *\"that all DJ\u2019s must speak Ukrainian, there should be Ukrainian music, and thus shape and form Ukrainian culture\".* Mr. Lemire finally added a phrase which could be understood to express some challenge to the National Council\u2019s determination that the channel should be 100% Ukrainian: *\"We should allow the audience to determine what it wants and we think that since Ukraine is seeking the status of a country with a market-economy, it should not introduce Ukrainian culture by force - it needs to be developed159\".*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-279.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-279, p. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-279, p. 10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-279, p. 10.\n\n407.\n\nThe National Council had defined as a fundamental condition for the new channel that it be 100% in Ukrainian. This was a legitimate decision, based on a public interest choice to extend the use of Ukrainian in the media. When awarding licences, the first criterion which the National Council must take into consideration is whether the winner will be able to fulfil the conditions to the best extent (Article 25.14 (a) of the LTR). Applying this criterion to the present tender, it seems both plausible and legitimate that NMB\u2019s and Gala\u2019s different experience and attitude towards broadcasting 100% in Ukrainian, swayed the Council members\u2019 votes in favour of Radio Era.\n\n408.\n\nAgainst the satisfactory explanation of the tender decision, the four circumstances alleged by Claimant cannot be accepted as evidence of a manipulation of the tender process amounting to a violation of the FET standard defined in Article II.3 of the BIT.\n\n**G) The Award of Frequencies During the Time When the National Council Was Not Operative**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nThe National Council became inoperative in March 1999, because its members were not appointed, and remained in this situation until June 2000160. Claimant submits that during this period, Respondent developed the practice of illegally awarding frequencies to companies other than Gala. The National Council then held its first tender on January 1, 2001, at which Claimant was not authorized to participate, and at which preferential treatment was given to the companies which had been illegally given licences during the National Council\u2019s black out period.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 67.3.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n410.\n\nIt is undisputed that between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000 the National Council did not function, because its members had not been appointed. After Parliament appointed its members on May 18, 2000 and the President made his appointment on June 9, 2000, a newly constituted National Council was able to resume its functions. It is also undisputed that on January 1, 2001 the first tender organized by the new National Council was held, and that Gala was not permitted to participate, because it was reserved for companies who had been affected by the National Council\u2019s black-out period.\n\n411.\n\nThere is an important dispute among the parties regarding the precise scope of companies which had access to this special tender.\n\n412.\n\nRespondent submits that the tender was reserved to broadcasters whose licence had expired while the National Council was inoperative161. Claimant\u2019s explanation is totally different: during the interregnum Ukraine had developed the practice that the State Committee grant licences for radio broadcasting, in violation of the LTR, through a non-transparent and closed procedure that was not available to Claimant162. And the first tender was organized to legitimize these beneficiaries.\n\nRespondent\u2019s counsel, Hearing Transcript 1, p. 71, at 16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 57.2.\n\n413.\n\nThere is strong evidence that Claimant\u2019s explanation is the correct one.\n\n414.\n\nFirst of all, the renewal of licences under the LTR does not require a tender (Article 24.9). Extension is a *\"right\"* of the licence holder, and the National Council can reject the application for extension only in very limited circumstances (Article 33.7). Respondent\u2019s explanation of what happened seems a legal impossibility, and is at any rate entirely implausible.\n\n415.\n\nSecondly, there is a letter sent on September 28, 1999 by S. Aksenenko, a member of the National Council, to the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine163, in which Mr. Aksenenko protests that other institutions of the executive branch are usurping the National Council\u2019s powers, taking advantage of the fact that it is not operative.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-11.\n\n416.\n\nFinally, Mr. Lemire has presented the transcript of a meeting held on March 19, 2001 with Mr. Koholod, the then chairman of the National Council, who acknowledged that during the interregnum *\"some bad things [were] happening\"* and that the State Committee, and not the National Council, had been issuing the licences164.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-101; Respondent has not challenged the accuracy of the transcript.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that during the period between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000, when the National Council was not operative, Respondent developed the practice that certain licences for radio broadcasting were issued directly by the executive branch of Government, without transparency or publicity and without meeting the requirements of or following the procedures established in the LTR. The *de facto* situation was then legalized through the first tender, convened by the National Council exclusively with this purpose. Claimant was excluded from this procedure.\n\n418.\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, Respondent\u2019s above described practice constitutes a violation of the FET standard established in Article II.3 of the BIT, because it facilitates the secret awarding of licences, without transparency, with total disregard of the process of law and without any possibility of judicial review. The practice must be considered arbitrary, since it meets the *Saluka* test of *\"manifestly violat[ing] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination165\".* The lack of propriety is such that - as the test was articulated in *Tecmed* and *Loewen* *-* the practice also *\"shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety166\".*\n\n*Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic PCA,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award of 17.March 2006, para 307.\n\nSee *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award of 29 May 2003, para. 154 and *Loewen Group Inc and Raymons L. Loewen v. United States of America,* ICSID No. ARB(AF)98/3, Award of 26 June 2003, para. 131.\n\n**VII.3.5. Conclusions Regarding the Awarding of Radio Licences**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nAs a starting point the Tribunal has studied the administrative procedure defined in Ukrainian Law for the issuance of radio frequencies. The conclusion reached by the Tribunal is that the procedure was marred by significant shortcomings (although these have been ameliorated after the 2006 amendment to the LTR). These weaknesses facilitated arbitrary or discriminatory decision-taking by the National Council.\n\n420.\n\nIn six years Gala Radio, although it tried insistently, and presented more than 200 applications for all types of frequencies, was only able to secure a single licence (in a small village in rural Ukraine). Gala\u2019s main competitors were much more successful and each received between 38 and 56 frequencies. Although this macro-statistical analysis does not provide conclusive evidence that Respondent, when awarding radio licences, has been violating the FET standard, there are factors (the strikingly different success rates of Gala and of its competitors, the inexistence of any information regarding the real owners of the competing stations, the impossibility of verifying the reasons why Gala was rejected) which can be construed as indications that at least some of the decisions of the National Council when it awarded frequencies were arbitrary and/or discriminatory.\n\n421.\n\nTo confirm or reject these indications, the Tribunal then looked in detail at five tenders for radio frequencies and at the administrative practice for awarding licences in the interregnum while the National Council was not operative between 1999 and 2000. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the following decisions did not meet the FET standard provided for in the BIT:\n\n- the National Council\u2019s decision adopted on October 19, 2005 granting an FM information channel to Radio Era, and the subsequent decisions to award 12 frequencies to radio Kokannya;\n\n- the National Council\u2019s decision of May 26, 2004 denying Gala Radio the licence for an AM channel, and the decision of December 21, 2004 granting such licence to NART TV;\n\n- the National Council\u2019s decision of February 6, 2008 denying Gala\u2019s application and accepting the application of Kiss Radio;\n\n- Respondent\u2019s practice of awarding radio licences while the National Council\u2019s was not operative between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000, and the National Council\u2019s decision of January 1, 2001 to legalize the licences illegally granted during the interregnum.\n\n422.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is unconvinced by Claimant\u2019s allegation that the National Council\u2019s decisions of November 20, 2002 and of October 19, 2005 represented a breach of the FET standard.\n\n**VII.3.6 Postponement of Decision Regarding Damages**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nClaimant has presented extensive allegations regarding damages, and an expert report prepared by Goldmedia. Respondent has submitted a counter report prepared by EBS. Both experts deposed during the hearing.\n\n424.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial, Respondent has added167 that the damage reports were prepared in the summer of 2008, that since then the economic basis has completely changed, and that the Ukrainian economy has shifted from a high growth rate to a sharp drop. There have also been significant changes in the parity of the UAH vis-\u00e0-vis the USD. Ukraine asserts that its economy *\"has been devastated by the worldwide economic crisis\"* and that it will shrink dramatically in the future. These changes in the overall economic climate, according to Ukraine have a significant impact on the DCF analysis presented by the experts.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 646.\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the changes suffered by the Ukrainian and the world economy since the dates when the expert reports were prepared, and its effects on the *quantum* of the damage, require further investigation. Furthermore, the assumptions underlying the experts\u2019 reports do not coincide with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in this Decision, and the quantum evidence therefore requires recalibration in accordance with the present decision. Consequently, the question of the appropriate redress of the breach, including the quantification of the damages, will be addressed in a short second phase of this arbitration. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal will issue a Procedural Order for the continuation of the procedure.\n\n**VII.4. Claimant\u2019s Second Allegation: the Continuous Harassment by Respondent and the Request for Moral Damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**VII.4.1. Claimant\u2019s Allegations**\n-----------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nClaimant submits168 that the National Council, in a concerted effort to force Claimant out of the radio industry, has:\n\n- abusively monitored and inspected Gala from 2005 through 2008;\n\n- issued two warnings to Gala and threatened issuance of a third warning with the purpose of revoking Gala\u2019s licence;\n\n- threatened Gala with non-renewal of its licence on the basis of the 2006 LTR disqualifying foreigners as \"founders\" of radio stations;\n\n- delayed the decision on the renewal of Gala\u2019s licence with a view to imposing a tenfold licence fee under a newly enacted formula; and\n\n- allowed only an unrealistically short period for payment for an exorbitant licence fee.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 125.\n\n427.\n\nClaimant adds that Gala was the first radio company which complied with the 50% Ukrainian music requirement, despite the negative effects on its ratings. This notwithstanding, in September 2005 the National Council inspected Gala and, as a result, issued a first warning on October 5, 2005. This warning was voided on April 4, 2006 by the Kyiv Economic Court, with the National Council\u2019s appeal dismissed on September 26, 2006.\n\n428.\n\nIn October and November 2005, Gala was again repeatedly monitored and inspected, with a second warning (dated November 23, 2005) as a result. Due process defence against this warning was denied to Claimant. Upon Gala\u2019s redress, the second warning was also voided by the Kyiv Economic Court and the National Council\u2019s appeal against that decision was again dismissed on February 15, 2007.\n\n429.\n\nIn May/June 2006 Gala was monitored and inspected yet again; and on July 19, 2006, the National Council met to decide on a third warning. Under the new 2006 LTR, a third warning would have enabled the National Council to institute court proceedings for revoking Gala\u2019s licence. Against this threat, the meeting was attended by five Gala executives, Gala\u2019s local and international attorneys, and the First Secretary of the US Embassy in Ukraine. In view of this presence, the National Council shied away from issuing a third warning.\n\n430.\n\nThe two warnings and the threat of a third, terminal warning were based on frivolous grounds. Claimant refers to other radio stations which were rarely inspected and did not receive warnings despite graver violations.\n\n431.\n\nClaimant further submits that the Chairman and other representatives of the National Council have repeatedly threatened to reject the renewal of Gala\u2019s broadcasting licence, which expired on September 18, 2008. They referred to Claimant\u2019s US citizenship and to Article 12(2) of the LTR, which prohibited the *\"foundation \"* of TV/radio stations by *\"foreign legal entities and physical persons\",* although a similar prohibition already existed in the historic 1993 LTR. Besides the National Council representatives knew that Claimant had acquired his controlling share in Gala from the Ukrainian company Provisen and thus had not been Gala\u2019s founder.\n\n432.\n\nWhile Gala had applied for an extension of its licence on March 13, 2008, the National Council delayed its final decision until July 19, 2008. It then applied a new formula for calculating the licence fee, which had been adopted by the Council of Ministers just on July 9, 2008. To make matters worse, the new formula was applied wrongly to Gala\u2019s detriment. As a result, Gala was invoiced a renewal fee of the equivalent of 1,039 million USD, more than ten times the fee that would have been due under the previous formula. Gala was allowed only 16 days for payment of this unexpectedly high fee. Other radio companies (e.g., HIT FM and Russkoye Radio owned by Mr. Bagrayev, a political ally of the President) had applied for a renewal of their licence later than Gala, but received the renewal before Gala, at a fee calculated under the previous formula.\n\n433.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, Claimant requested a Provisional Measure from the Tribunal, suspending ultimate payment of the renewal fee until the Final Award in this arbitration. On August 19, 2008, Respondent requested that Mr. Paulsson resign as an arbitrator in the present case, due to the involvement of his law firm in another case with Respondent as a party; this request and a subsequent official challenge by Respondent to Mr. Paulsson\u2019s impartiality, delayed the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the requested Provisional Measures.\n\n434.\n\nThe National Council finally reassessed the renewal fee to the amount expected by Claimant. This reassessment was prompted by an advice from the Ministry of Justice that the previous formula (rather than the new formula) was applicable to Gala\u2019s renewal fee.\n\n435.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that the harassment finally has not been successful, because the broadcasting licences have been extended with the payment of the correct fees, Gala has not been fined and the warnings have been quashed by the Ukrainian Courts. But Claimant submits that this does not provide Claimant with immunity from paying damages for the harassment and moral harm that Ukraine\u2019s malicious acts have caused. Invoking the precedent of *DLP v. Yemen169,* Claimant requests that Respondent *\"be held to be liable to reparation for the injury suffered by Claimant, whether bodily, moral or material in nature\".* Respondent\u2019s harassment has inflicted significant moral harm, including anxiety, pain and suffering, for which Respondent should be held liable in the amount of three million USD.\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award of 6 February 2008.\n\n**VII.4.2. Respondent\u2019s Allegations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nRespondent denies170 that the National Council had any intention, let alone concerted action strategy, to shut down Gala and force Claimant out of the radio industry in Ukraine. All monitoring, inspections and other actions advanced by Claimant were performed by the National Council in the exercise of its regulatory and supervisory responsibilities as per the parameters and guidance provided in applicable legislation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 516.\n\n437.\n\nStatistics refute Claimant\u2019s allegation that Gala had been targeted for excessive monitoring and inspections. During 2004 - 2008, the National Council ordered a total of 1438 inspections and issued a total of 288 warnings. The five inspections of and two warnings to Gala are not egregious. Other broadcasters similarly had experienced between three and six inspections; and five broadcasters had even received three warnings and presently face court proceedings for cancellation of their licences.\n\n438.\n\nThe procedures for monitoring and inspections are not inequitable, arbitrary or discriminatory, and are equally applied to all broadcasters under the jurisdiction of the National Council. As a matter of administrative routine, broadcasters are continuously monitored to check whether they comply with applicable legislation and with their licences. Monitoring is based on an evaluation of the programmes broadcast; it does not involve the companies and does not interrupt their business. Inspections are ordered by the National Council if monitoring reveals indications of violations; they are carried out at the premises of the radio station and last one business day at most. Inspection reports are immediately shared with the broadcasters concerned and submitted for decision to the National Council. If the inspection reveals violations of either applicable legislation or the terms of a broadcaster\u2019s licence, the National Council may impose sanctions. These range from warnings (lightest sanction) and monetary penalties to court proceedings and revocation of licence. Sanctions imposed can be appealed to Ukrainian Courts.\n\n439.\n\nGala was monitored in September 2005, together with several other broadcasters, in accordance with the normal administrative process. Since violations of applicable legislation were detected (with respect to Ukrainian language and advertising rules), the National Council by letter of September 27, 2005 informed Gala of its decision to conduct a first inspection on September 30, 2005. When the National Council experts tried to perform this inspection, Gala representatives denied them access to Gala\u2019s premises. The National Council thereupon issued a first warning on October 5, 2005 and, at the same time, decided to repeat the inspection within two weeks. On April 4, 2006 this first warning was quashed by the Kiyv Economic Court, on the ground that the National Council had failed to prove receipt by Gala of the Council\u2019s aforementioned letter of September 27, 2005.\n\n440.\n\nGala was inspected again on October 19, 2005. This inspection detected violations of broadcasting and advertising legislation, and of the terms of Gala\u2019s licence regarding children\u2019s and educational programs. On November 2, 2005 the National Council discussed the inspection results with Gala and gave it two weeks to cure the violations. After negative results of a subsequent monitoring, the National Council issued a second warning on November 23, 2005, requiring Gala to cure the violations within six months. This second warning was also quashed by the Kiev Economic Court, on the ground that it was based on an inspection prompted by the first warning, which had been voided previously by the Court.\n\n441.\n\nOn May 27, 2006, i.e. six months after the second warning, a monitoring revealed that Gala had not ceased in its violations. Thereupon, a third inspection was carried out on June 2, 2006. It confirmed continuing violations as per the monitoring report, but also noted that Gala had rectified its previous violations regarding broadcasting in Ukrainian language. In view of this improvement, the National Council abstained from issuing a third warning.\n\n442.\n\nIn 2008, Gala was inspected twice, in April as a routine matter in advance of the pending renewal of Gala\u2019s licence and on June 3 after monitoring detected a violation of Ukrainian election legislation. The April inspection was inconsequential, while the June inspection confirmed the violation. Nevertheless, the National Council, in its meeting on June 18 accepted Claimant\u2019s explanation that the violation was accidental, did not issue a warning but rather proceeded with the renewal of Gala\u2019s licence.\n\n443.\n\nNational Council representatives have never threatened to deny the renewal of Gala\u2019s licence due to Claimant\u2019s US citizenship.\n\n444.\n\nThe licence was renewed on July 19, 2008 in due time before its expiry on September 18, 2008. The processing time was required for clarification of outstanding issues.\n\n445.\n\nThe renewal fee had initially been calculated under the new formula on the National Council\u2019s understanding that the Cabinet decree had entered into force at the date of its receipt by the National Council on July 11, 2008. Since the renewal had been granted thereafter (July 16), the Council had applied the new formula in good faith. Nevertheless, the National Council had sought the guidance of the Cabinet of Ministers on the issue as early as August 11, 2008, i.e. before Claimant\u2019s request for Provisional Measures challenging the fee. The Cabinet had referred the matter to the Ministry of Justice, which on September 15, 2008 advised the National Council that the formula entered into force only with the publication of the decree in the Official Bulletin of Ukraine on July 18, 2008, i.e. after the renewal of Gala\u2019s licence on July 16. In light of this advice, the National Council promptly recalculated the fee under the previous formula, more advantageous to Claimant, and informed the Tribunal accordingly.\n\n446.\n\nThe challenge of Mr. Paulsson as an arbitrator in the present proceeding had been prompted by disagreements between Claimant and Respondent regarding implications of the issue for the status of the final award. It had nothing to do with Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures and/or the calculation of the renewal fee.\n\n447.\n\nThe fact that the two warnings against Gala have been set aside by Ukrainian Courts shows, in Respondent\u2019s view, that the Ukrainian system provided adequate redress against administrative error, in compliance with the FET standard under the BIT.\n\n448.\n\nClaimant had suffered no harm as a result of the National Council\u2019s actions wrongly described by Mr. Lemire as harassment. All inspections together have taken at most four business days over a four-year period. Claimant is still operating a profitable business - a fact which according to Respondent precludes any claim on the basis of *\"creeping expropriation\"* or violation of *\"full protection and security\".*\n\n**VII.4.3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A) Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n449.\n\nClaimant\u2019s basic line of reasoning is that, behind the individual facts of this case, an overall aim appears: the Ukrainian authorities\u2019 desire to get rid of an annoying American investor, by systematically denying any application for further frequencies, thwarting plans to create new channels, and harassing him with irregular inspections and difficulties for the renewal of his licence.\n\n450.\n\nRespondent has vehemently denied the accusation. Chairman Shevchenko has stated that the National Council never resorted to procedures aimed at any revocation of the Gala Radio licence and has not even contemplated such steps171.\n\nReespondent\u2019s Rebuttal Witness Statement of Mr. Shevchenko dated 2 December 2008, p.31.\n\n451.\n\nThe Tribunal has already come to the conclusion that Respondent\u2019s practice regarding the allocation of frequencies is not compatible with the FET standard defined in the BIT. As a consequence of the violation of the BIT Claimant is entitled to be indemnified for the economic damages he has suffered. As has already been stated (see paragraph 426 above), this issue will be addressed in a subsequent phase of this arbitration.\n\n452.\n\nClaimant is now asking that the Tribunal decide whether the harassment which he allegedly suffered, entitles him to receive an additional indemnification, further to the economic loss, for the moral damage suffered. The harassment in itself cannot constitute additional violations of the BIT because, as Claimant himself acknowledges, in the end the inspections led to no sanctions and the licence was correctly extended. For this reason, Claimant restricts his prayer for relief to a request that the Tribunal indemnify Claimant for the moral harm he has suffered, caused by Respondent\u2019s continuing harassment.\n\n453.\n\nIn order to decide this claim, the Tribunal has to analyze the two separate issues submitted by Claimant, the inspection of Gala Radio (B) and the renewal of the licence (C), leading to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions (D).\n\n**B) The Inspection of Gala Radio**\n-----------------------------------\n\n454.\n\nThe National Council is the supervisor and regulator of the TV and radio sector in Ukraine (Articles 13 and 14 of the LNC). As such, the Council has the power to monitor and inspect radio companies, including Gala Radio. The procedure of inspection is defined in Articles 70 to 75 of the LTR, and in an Instruction of the National Council, issued in 2003 and amended in subsequent years172. Monitoring is a process of recording and analyzing the broadcasting of a radio company, and is done directly by the National Council, without involvement of the radio station. An inspection is a more serious review, which requires access to the company\u2019s premises. Inspections can be scheduled - i.e. in accordance with a plan approved by the National Council - or unscheduled - i.e. motivated by some exceptional circumstance.\n\nResponent\u2019s Exhibit RLA-15 (original text) and RLA-64 (amended text).\n\n455.\n\nThe results of an inspection are formalized in an inspection report; the affected company has access to the report, and is entitled to give explanations, to provide evidence and to file claims (Article 73.3 of the LTR). The inspection report, prepared by the National Council staff, is submitted to the National Council which has the right either to close the file without sanction, or to issue a warning, to impose a penalty or to appeal to a Court in order to revoke the licence (Article 72.6 of the LTR). The practice of the National Council is to listen during the meeting to an oral explanation of the representative of the radio company173.\n\nInspector Iulian Leliukh, Hearing Transcript 4, p.103, at 15.\n\n456.\n\nIt is undisputed that until 2005 Gala was never inspected. Since then, Gala has suffered five inspections, four of which were unscheduled174.\n\nMr. Denisenko, Hearing Transcript 2, p. 209, at 16.\n\nThe first warning\n-----------------\n\n457.\n\nThe first inspection took place on September 28, 2005, and it has been described in detail in the report prepared by the inspectors175. The day before the inspection, the inspectors had sent a fax to Radio Gala, announcing their visit for the next day. When they arrived, a female employee told them that the management of the company was outside Kyiv, and would not return until October 17, 2005. The employee stated that she *\"was not authorized to provide any information or documents\".*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-270.\n\n458.\n\nA week later, on October 5, 2005 the National Council decided to issue a warning to Gala because the personnel of Gala Radio *\"prevented [National Council representatives] from carrying out their legitimate actions\"*176, by refusing to produce the documents and materials required for conducting the inspection. The decision was abusive, because the inspectors\u2019 report did not reflect any refusal to cooperate, only the absence of management, and because the advance notice had been unreasonably short. Besides, there is no evidence that Gala was heard before the decision was adopted, and the LTR does not typify the refusal to produce documents as a sanctionable wrong. Gala successfully challenged the warning before the Kyiv Economic Court, and it was set aside by this Court on April 11, 2006. The National Council appealed, the appeal was rejected on February 14, 2008.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-272.\n\nThe second warning\n------------------\n\n459.\n\nOn October 14, 2005 the National Council informed Gala that an inspection would be performed on October 19, 2005. The inspection took place on this date, in the presence of Mr. Lemire, who refused to sign the inspection report177. The inspection report reflects the following:\n\n- the language of programs is Ukrainian;\n\n- the language of commercials is predominantly Ukrainian, although two commercials were in Russian, which represents a violation of the Law on Advertising;\n\n- there is one instance where a commercial was not separated from other elements of the program, in violation of the Law on Advertising;\n\n- the air time devoted to information programs, to educational programs and to children programs were significantly less than the figures mentioned in the licence.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-276.\n\n460.\n\nOn November 2, 2005 the National Council met, heard representatives of Gala, and decided to postpone their vote for two weeks178. On November 23, the National Council met again and issued a warning against Gala, for the reasons set forth in the inspectors\u2019 report. The warning was cancelled by the Kyiv Economic Court on February 15, 2007, because the Court considered the inspection illegal179.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-282; Respondent submits that the two weeks delay was to permit Gala to cure the irregularities; this does not derive from the transcript.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s submission to the Court in Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-312.\n\nThe June 2006 inspection\n------------------------\n\n461.\n\nWith two warnings against Gala in the appeal Courts, on May 29, 2006 Chairman Shevchenko ordered the Control and Monitoring Department of the National Council to conduct a new inspection, which was carried out on June 2, 2006. Inspector Leliukh has declared that the inspection was conducted in a hostile environment, and that Mr. Lemire was accompanied by four lawyers and a representative of the American Embassy. The inspection report came to the following conclusions180:\n\n- the advertising exceeded the 20% legal maximum per hour (i.e. 12 minutes maximum) in four hourly time periods: from 9 am to 10 am, by 18 seconds, from 12 pm to 1 pm, by 14 seconds, from 1 pm to 2 pm, by 3 seconds and from 5 pm to 6 pm by 12 seconds;\n\n- Gala was basically complying with the licence conditions, it had broadcast 6.36 h. of cultural programs, when the licence required 3.50 h.; Gala had however failed to broadcast children\u2019s programs, as required by the licence;\n\n- Gala was complying with the 50% Ukrainian music percentage;\n\n- language is 100% Ukrainian, including advertisements;\n\n- two advertisements were not clearly separated from the other elements of the program.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-298.\n\n462.\n\nClaimant asserts that the inspection team, headed by Inspector Leliukh, included in its submission to the National Council a proposal that a third warning be issued. A third warning would have blocked the renewal process for the licence, which was then under discussion and might have triggered an action to revoke Claimant\u2019s licence (although this is not a must: the LTR does not require that a third warning triggers a procedure of licence revocation). Claimant was sufficiently worried about the prospect of a third warning and its consequences that he asked for the assistance of US Embassy officials and of his international lawyers at the meeting of July 19, 2006 to lobby against the issuance of the third warning.\n\n463.\n\nInspector Leliukh, asked by the Tribunal if he had recommended issuing a third warning, answered: *\"I do not remember whether or not I recommended a warning181* And under cross examination, asked whether the draft resolution would be in the record of the National Council, he stated that *\"as a rule a draft resolution is not maintained - resolutions themselves are archived, not draft resolutions182*\n\nInspector Iulian Leliukh, Hearing Transcript 4, p. 111, at 8.\n\nInspector Iulian Leliukh, Hearing Transcript 4, p. 116, at 7.\n\n464.\n\nAlthough Inspector Leliukh does not remember, there is clear evidence in the file showing that a third warning was indeed proposed. Respondent has submitted the transcript of the July 19, 2006 session183, and there it is clearly stated that Shevchenko put the draft decision for issuing a warning to the vote. The decision received one vote in favour (from Chairman Shevchenko) and five members abstained, and consequently it was rejected. Immediately thereafter, a new decision was tabled and carried unanimously. This decision states that the National Council:\n\n- takes knowledge of the report resulting from Gala\u2019s inspection;\n\n- obligates the management of Gala to bring its activities in line with the licence, Deputy Chairman Kurus being in charge of control of this obligation; and\n\n- informs the founders of Gala that in accordance with Article 12 of the LTR foreigners are prohibited from being the founders of radio stations.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-306, p. 2070.\n\n465.\n\nThe reference to the founding of Gala, and to Article 12 of the LTR, is especially troubling. In accordance with the records, which must have been available to the National Council, Gala Radio had not been founded by Mr. Lemire, but by Provisen, an Ukrainian company, and Claimant subsequently bought a controlling stake in the company. The prohibition of foreign foundership of radio stations was already included in Article 13 of the 1993 LTR, and was then taken over into Article 12 of the 2006 LTR. Consequently, it existed when the National Council authorized Mr. Lemire\u2019s purchase of the control in Gala.\n\n466.\n\nThe July 19, 2006 decision of the National Council *\"informs\"* the founders of Gala that foreigners are prohibited from being founders of radio stations. This statement is difficult to understand, because:\n\n- it seems incongruous in a decision regarding the imposition of a sanction to Gala;\n\n- it is unnecessary, if it is just a reminder of a legal rule which had existed since 1993;\n\n- it is without purpose, because a company can never retroactively change its founders;\n\n- if it purports to be an anticipation of what the National Council would decide in the future (the licence will not be renewed, because Mr. Lemire is American), it is legally incorrect, because Mr. Lemire is not the founder and his investment had been duly authorized.\n\nThe 2008 inspections\n--------------------\n\n467.\n\nIn April 2008 Gala was subject to a further, scheduled inspection, which resulted in a conclusion that there was no irregularity.\n\n468.\n\nThen, in June 3, 2008 an additional unscheduled inspection took place, which led to a decision of the National Council on June 18, 2008. What had happened was that on the day of the Municipal Elections, a candidate had spoken on Gala Radio, starting his words by saying *\"I will not promote myself... I will not advertise either. All I wanted to say is that everyone has to come\".* Hereafter, he made a short presentation why citizens should vote in his favour. The inspection report prepared by the National Council inspection team stated that the broadcasting of these declarations violated the Ukrainian Election Law which requires that *\"campaigning\"* cease 24 hours before the vote184.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-373.\n\n469.\n\nDuring the session of the National Council on June 18, 2008185, a member of the National Council acknowledged that all TV channels show interviews with various candidates during the ballot casting. Gala explained at the hearing that they had committed a mistake. Respondent submits that the National Council decided not to issue a warning186.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-375 (transcript of the meeting).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 548; not contradicted by Claimant; the transcript of the meeting, however, is not clear; Chairman Shevchenko\u2019s last words are: *\"But they admit their fault, saying* *that it was all by accident, and we agree with this point, advising the company to take this fact into account as a warning\"*\n\n**C) Renewal of the Licence**\n-----------------------------\n\n470.\n\nGala Radio\u2019s licence was due for renewal on September 18, 2008. Claimant applied for renewal on March 13, 2008. The National Council reacted with a number of documentary requests, to which Gala duly responded187. The licence was eventually issued on July 16, 2008, on the last possible meeting of the National Council.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibits CRIM-5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n471.\n\nOn July 25, 2008 Gala received an invoice for more than one million USD, which represented a 10 fold increase with regard to the renewal fee which would have been applicable in accordance with the guidelines approved in 1995. The new methodology for calculating had been approved by the National Council on November 22, 2006, but required a confirmation decision from the Cabinet of Ministers. On July 9, 2008 the Cabinet adopted the necessary decree, and the National Council at its meeting of July 16, 2008 declared that the new methodology would be used to calculate its fees - the same meeting which approved the extension of Gala\u2019s licence.\n\n472.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s opinion, the National Council on purpose delayed the application process, in order to be able to charge the higher fee188. Claimant further alleges that Russkoie Radio and Hit FM - both allegedly owned by Mr. Bagrayev, National Council member until 2002 - applied for their renewal after Gala, but were awarded their licence on May 28, 2008, seven weeks before Gala189. This statement has not been denied by Respondent.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 248.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 253.\n\n473.\n\nClaimant finally was only required to pay the lower, historic fee. The reason for this is that when the National Council issued the one million USD plus invoice, it failed to take into consideration, that on the date of Gala\u2019 renewal the decree had not yet been published in the Official Bulletin, and consequently it had not entered into force and could not be applied to the Gala licence renewal.\n\n474.\n\nClaimant filed a request for interim measures in this arbitration, Ukraine eventually accepted Claimant\u2019s arguments and modified the licence renewal fee to the historic figure, which Claimant accepted and duly paid, desisting from the Request.\n\n**D) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThe Tribunal is in this case confronted with a request for moral damages, which Claimant allegedly has suffered as a consequence of harassment by the National Council. The moral damages - as alleged by Claimant - include anxiety, pain and suffering, and they are estimated at three million USD, a figure which is deemed *\"very conservative... in light of the long duration,* *intensive and diverse harassment to which Respondent has subjected Claimant190*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 147.\n\nMoral damages in investment arbitrations\n----------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nIn most legal systems, damages which can be recovered by the aggrieved include not only the *damnum emergens* and *lucrum cessans,* but also moral damages. The Tribunal shares the conclusions reached in *Desert Line Projects**191* *:*\n\n*\"Even if investment treaties primarily aim at protecting property and economic values, they do not exclude, as such, that a party may, in exceptional circumstances, ask for compensation for moral damages\".*\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award of 29 January 2008, para. 289.\n\n477.\n\nThe circumstances in *Desert Line Projects* were very exceptional indeed. Claimant had been subject to physical duress and suffered a siege by the armed forces of Respondent.\n\n478.\n\nCan moral damages be applied in the factual situation of this case in which Claimant is not making any allegation of physical duress?\n\n479.\n\nClaimant in essence is submitting that the National Council incurred in systemic bias against Gala Radio. Not only did the National Council reject the 200 applications made by the radio station for new frequencies, jeopardizing Gala\u2019s plans to expand its activities, but it also maliciously subjected Gala to a series of inspections, with the hidden agenda to close it down, and then in bad faith delayed the renewal of the licence, until a new regulation had come into force, which increased the renewal fee by 10.\n\n480.\n\nClaimant\u2019s accusations are very grave indeed.\n\n481.\n\nThe National Council is Radio Gala\u2019s lawful supervisor and regulator, entrusted by Ukrainian law with authorizing, monitoring, inspecting and sanctioning TV and radio stations. Agencies with powers analogous to those of the National Council exist in most jurisdictions, because they have proven necessary in order to guarantee correct assignment of scarce frequencies, protection of rights of viewers and listeners and defence of liberty of information and plurality of opinions. Regulatory agencies, provided by law with wide powers to intervene, must act with absolute independence and impartiality. And regulated entities have an obligation to cooperate with their supervisor, to follow their supervisor\u2019s instructions and to comply with applicable rules.\n\n482.\n\nIn all jurisdictions regulated entities are also required to respect and cooperate with their lawful regulatory agencies. Mr. Lemire\u2019s behaviour vis-\u00e0-vis the National Council, and his extensive use of the Courts to obtain redress for his grievances and of the American Embassy to secure protection, may have looked rude and disrespectful to the Ukrainian authorities. But the personal behaviour of the regulated should never impair on the impartiality of the supervisor.\n\n483.\n\nAnother important aspect to bear in mind is whether the Ukrainian legal system affords an efficient system for appealing the regulator\u2019s decisions before a Court. That right also exists in Ukraine, and it has worked. The Courts have twice quashed (in first instance and then on appeal) illegal decisions of the National Council. And in the case of the renewal fees, the Ministry of Justice has sided with Claimant against the National Council.\n\n484.\n\nThe Tribunal has analyzed in detail the relationship between Gala Radio and the National Council and certain facts stand out:\n\n- Gala was never inspected until 2005, and in the next three years it was the object of five inspections, of which four were unscheduled;\n\n- the first warning issued by the National Council against Gala was clearly abusive, and was correctly set aside by the Ukrainian Courts;\n\n- the second warning was issued for alleged infractions which to an impartial bystander look petty; this warning was again set aside by the Courts;\n\n- the draft resolution of the National Council proposed the issuance of a third warning, and Chairman Shevchenko voted in favour; the underlying inspection report showed that most of the infractions which led to the second warning had been cured, and only found some very minor infringements;\n\n- the third warning was rejected, but the National Council adopted a decision which seemed to imply that Mr. Lemire, as an American, was prohibited by law from being the rightful owner of Gala;\n\n- the facts which led to the 2008 inspection probably did not merit the commencement of an inspection procedure, since similar actions had been committed by other TV and radio stations, which were not inspected;\n\n- Gala\u2019s application for extension of its licence was delayed in comparison with other applications; it was approved in the same session when the National Council approved a 10 fold increase in the renewal fees.\n\n485.\n\nIf these facts are added to the National Council\u2019s rejection of all (bar one) of Gala\u2019s applications for new licences, the resulting overall picture is that Gala has received a one-sided treatment from its regulator. Gala\u2019s reaction, consisting in a vehement defence of its rights, presence of US Embassy officials, protest before the National Council and successive appeals to the Ukrainian Courts, seem to have exacerbated the National Council\u2019s stance.\n\n486.\n\nSince the Tribunal has already decided that certain of Respondent\u2019s actions related to awarding radio frequencies are not compatible with the FET standard defined in the BIT, Claimant will in any case be entitled to an economic indemnification. Whether the facts of the case constitute *\"exceptional circumstances\"*, which merit the awarding of moral damages, is a question which the Tribunal will decide in a future phase of this procedure when it may have the benefit of further insights, notably into context and causation.\n\n**VII.5. Claimant\u2019s Third Allegation: the Violation of the FET Standard by Other Actions Performed by Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nClaimant\u2019s main allegation is that the allocation of frequencies has given rise to a violation of the FET standard. In addition, Claimant submits an ancillary claim: that a number of other actions or omissions, which primarily constitute a breach of the Settlement Agreement, are also are unfair, inequitable, arbitrary or discriminatory192. In Claimant\u2019s opinion these actions or omissions constitute not only a breach of the Settlement Agreement, but also a violation of the FET standard defined in the BIT.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 67.\n\n488.\n\nThe actions alleged by Claimant are the following:\n\n- (i) the failure of the National Council to acknowledge its obligations under the Settlement Agreement193 or to acknowledge the Settlement Agreement as legal or binding194;\n\n- (ii) the State Centre\u2019s decision to allocate low powered and contested frequencies195; and\n\n- (iii) Respondent\u2019s failure to correct interferences.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 67.4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 67.6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 67.7 and 67.8.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal has already analysed whether these actions and omissions represented defaults under the Settlement Agreement, and come to the conclusion that they did not. It will now review, albeit rather summarily, whether these actions conceivably could imply an international law delinquency of Ukraine and a violation of the BIT.\n\nFirst and second claim\n----------------------\n\n490.\n\n(i) and (ii): Since the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that Respondent did not breach its obligations under the Settlement Agreement, and that frequencies allocated were appropriate (see paragraph 209 above), Claimant\u2019s allegation that the failure to acknowledge the Settlement Agreement or the allocation of frequencies could conceivably constitute an international wrong has no chance of succeeding.\n\n491.\n\nClaimant\u2019s first and second claims are dismissed.\n\nFailure to correct interferences\n--------------------------------\n\n492.\n\n(iii): There is a final type of action or failure to act, which Claimant submits amounts to a violation of the FET standard, and which merits a more in-depth analysis. This is Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to correct the interferences on Gala 100 FM. Such failure would have related to interferences that occurred after the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement and would thus not have been affected by the Tribunal\u2019s decision that Respondent has performed its obligations under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n493.\n\nClaimant\u2019s argument runs as follows196: Respondent, as the host state and as issuing authority and regulator of frequencies, has the duty to ensure that any investor can enjoy the normal operation and use of his investment. This includes - in Claimant\u2019s assertion - an obligation to provide a frequency that is free of interference, however caused, and an obligation to monitor and regulate other radio companies.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 67.1.\n\n494.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with Claimant\u2019s reasoning.\n\n495.\n\nInterference occurs when other radio stations which are also broadcasting do not remain within the prescribed deviation level. The record shows that Claimant on seven occasions between 2000 and 2007 complained to the State Centre, protesting that Gala\u2019s signal was suffering interference. The complains were made in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006 (2) and 2007 (2)197. The record shows that the State Centre reacted, at least trying to solve the problems. On August 17, 2004 the State Centre ordered two radio stations which were causing interference to cease doing so198. The State Centre monitored the 100 FM frequencies during the year 2007, and found no interference199. Finally, as Claimant acknowledges, after an extensive period of monitoring during the autumn 2008, the problem has now been - to use Claimant\u2019s words - *\"significantly reduced200*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 170.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibits R-84 and R-85.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-146.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 48.\n\n496.\n\nClaimant\u2019s allegation that Ukraine\u2019s conduct with regard to the interferences constitutes a violation of the BIT is bound to fail. The State Centre may have been performing the public service of monitoring and supervising radio frequencies with more or less diligence; the solution adopted in 2008 probably could have been anticipated; but even if Claimant\u2019s allegations were accepted to be true, they would never give rise to an international delinquency of Ukraine, nor amount to the violation of the FET and full protection standards defined in the BIT. Not every malfunctioning of a public service, suffered by a foreign investor, not every lack of diligence by a supervisory authority opens the door to a claim under the BIT. As has already been explained, the violation of the FET standard requires significantly more, namely that the actions of the State trespass a certain standard of propriety. The evidence does not support that in this instance the threshold has been surpassed.\n\n**VII.6. Claimant\u2019s Fourth Allegation: the \"Umbrella Clause\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nArticle II.3 (c) of the BIT includes the so called Umbrella Clause:\n\n*\"Each party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\".*\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant\u2019s submission that Article II.3 (c) of the BIT brings the Settlement Agreement into the ambit of the BIT, so that any violation of the private law agreement becomes *ipso iure* a violation of the international law BIT. This, however, exhausts the effect of the Umbrella Clause; the Umbrella Clause has no impact on the meaning or scope of the Settlement Agreement. In other words, any violation of the Umbrella Clause presupposes a breach of the Settlement Agreement. Since the Arbitral Tribunal has already come to the conclusion that Respondent has not breached its obligations under the Settlement Agreement, the Umbrella Clause of the BIT is moot and Respondent cannot have violated the BIT on this footing.\n\n**VII.7. Claimant\u2019s Fifth Allegation: the Prohibition of Local Purchase**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A) Allegation of the Parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nClaimant\u2019s final allegation201 is that the 2006 LTR, by imposing a 50% Ukrainian music requirement, breaches Article II.6 of the BIT which does not allow the host state to *\"impose performance requirements as a condition...\"* Claimant acknowledges that Respondent has tried to justify the legal imposition on public policy grounds. Yet, even assuming its validity, this argument can, in Claimant\u2019s opinion, at best justify the breach, subject to the payment of the corresponding damages. And the damages sustained by Gala were significant, because its program concept is based 100% on hits. The high level of the local source requirement and its abrupt incorporation caused Claimant to lose advertising revenue, resulting in a damage of 958,000 USD.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 148.\n\n500.\n\nRespondent disagrees202. A change in the host\u2019s State\u2019s regulatory framework does not equate with a breach of the BIT. The protection of the legitimate expectations must be balanced with the need to maintain a reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility on the part of the host State in order to respond to changing circumstances in the public interest. The imposition of a Ukrainian music requirement is neither abrupt, excessive nor unfair, and did not breach Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 570.\n\n**B) Decision of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nThe facts of this allegation are rather straightforward. Article 9.1 of the 2006 LTR required that \" *music produced in Ukraine shall constitute at least 50% of general broadcasting time of each... radio organization\".* This requirement applies to all broadcasters in Ukraine, not only to Gala Radio. *\"Music produced in Ukraine\"* includes any music where the author, the composer and/or the performer is Ukrainian.\n\n502.\n\nThe implementation of this new requirement was not immediate, but in steps. On July 21, 2006 the National Council and certain radio companies signed a memorandum203, which provided that the requirement would be implemented in stages from October 1, 2006 through February 1, 2007. Gala adhered to this memorandum in August 2006.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Exhibit R-131.\n\n503.\n\nGala\u2019s basic criticism204 with regard to the new Ukrainian music requirement is that there are too few hits of Ukrainian music, and since its formula is 100% hits, it must continuously replay the same few Ukrainian hits. In Claimant\u2019s opinion, the 50% Ukrainian music requirement violates Article II.6 of the BIT, which provides as follows:\n\n*\"Neither party shall impose performance requirements as a condition of establishment, expansion or maintenance of investments, which require or enforce commitments to export goods produced, or which specify that goods and services must be purchased locally, or which impose any other similar requirements\".*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 207.\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with Claimant\u2019s contention.\n\n505.\n\nAs a sovereign State, Ukraine has the inherent right to regulate its affairs and adopt laws in order to protect the common good of its people, as defined by its Parliament and Government. The prerogative extends to promulgating regulations which define the State\u2019s own cultural policy. The promotion of domestic music may validly reflect a State policy to preserve and strengthen cultural inheritance and national identity. The *\"high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders205\"* is reinforced in cases when the purpose of the legislation affects deeply felt cultural or linguistic traits of the community.\n\n*S.D. Myers Inc. v. Canada,* UNCITRAL, First Partial Award of 13 November 2000, para. 263.\n\n506.\n\nThe desire to protect national culture is not unique to Ukraine. France requires that French radio stations broadcast a minimum of 40% of French music206, Portugal has a 25 - 40% Portuguese music quota207 and a number of other countries impose similar requirements208. The Tribunal in *Plama* reasoned that a rule cannot be said to be unfair, inadequate, inequitable or discriminatory, when it has been adopted by many countries around the world209. If one adds that the 50% Ukrainian music rule is applied to all broadcasters, the necessary conclusion is that it is compatible with the FET standard defined in the BIT.\n\nArticle 12 I *Loi n\u00b0 86-1067 du 30 septembre 1986 relative \u00e0 la Libert\u00e9 de Communication**,* amended by *Loi n\u00b0 94-88 du 1er f\u00e9vrier 1994.*\n\nArticle 44 A 1 Lei 7/2006 de 3 de mar\u00e7o.\n\nSee K. Bhattachrjee: *\"Local Content Rules in Broadcasting\"**,* reproduced as Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RLA-41.\n\nSee *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/02, Award of 27 August 2008, para 269.\n\n507.\n\nBut this conclusion is really *obiter dicta,* because Claimant challenges the 50% Ukrainian music requirement not as a violation of the FET standard, but rather as a breach of the local content rule contained in Article II.6 which prohibits *\"performance requirements... which specify that goods or services must be purchased locally\".* Is this rule applicable to a cultural restriction like the 50% Ukrainian music requirement?\n\n508.\n\nThe answer to this question requires that Article II.6 be interpreted *\"in accordance with the* ordinary *meaning* *to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its* *object and purpose* \" (Article 31.1. Vienna Convention)210.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n509.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the terms used by a treaty provides the first criterion of interpretation. The BIT prohibits that local law specify that *\"goods or services...must be purchased locally\".* It can be argued that the LTR does not fall foul of this rule: the law does not specify that radio stations must purchase any goods or services locally, but rather that a certain percentage of the music broadcast should be authored, composed or produced by Ukrainian artists. The argument, however, is not decisive, because it might be reasoned *de adverso* that although the LTR does not prohibit radio stations from obtaining Ukrainian music from non-Ukrainian sources, *de facto* the market for Ukrainian-authored, -composed or -produced music is located in Ukraine.\n\n510.\n\nThe object and purpose of Article II.6 sheds more light on its correct interpretation. The object of the BIT is to *\"promote greater economic cooperation\"* between the Parties (Preamble II). And the purpose of Article II.6 is trade-related: to avoid that States impose local content requirements as a protection of local industries against competing imports. When in 2006 Ukraine amended the LTR, the underlying reasons were not to protect local industries and restrict imports, but rather to promote Ukraine\u2019s cultural inheritance, a purpose which is compatible with Article II.6 of the BIT.\n\n511.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Article 9.1 of the 2006 LTR, which requires that *\"[...] music produced in Ukraine shall constitute at least 50% of general broadcasting time of each... radio organization\"* does not amount to a violation of the local content rule contained in Article II. 6 of the BIT which prohibits *\"performance requirements... which specify that goods or services must be purchased locally\".*\n\n**VII.8. Other Allegations**\n----------------------------\n\n512.\n\nIn his Memorial, Claimant included alleged additional violations of the BIT, referring to affiliation agreements, trademarks and the expropriation of a beauty salon. This last claim has been specifically withdrawn, and the other two have not been addressed either at the hearing or in the Post-Hearing Memorial, and seem to have been tacitly dropped. To the extent that these claims may still be alive, the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s conduct with regard to Gala\u2019s affiliation agreements or to its request for trademark protection does not amount to a violation of the BIT.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n513.\n\nIn view of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously as regards Sections I trough VI, and by majority as regards some aspects and conclusions of Section VII, decides as follows:\n\n1. to dismiss Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\n2. to declare that Respondent has not breached any obligations assumed in the Settlement Agreement;\n\n3. to declare that Respondent, in the manner in which it dealt with the award of radio frequencies as described in paragraph 422 of this Decision, breached Article II.3 of the BIT; and\n\n4. to dismiss all other claims regarding the merits submitted by Claimant.\n\n514.\n\nThe question of the appropriate redress of the breach, including questions of *quantum,* will be addressed in a second phase of this arbitration, for which the Tribunal retains jurisdiction. The Tribunal will issue a Procedural Order for the continuation of the procedure. The question of costs is reserved until the Award."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2011-03-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2011-03-01T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss (Award)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**SUMMARY**\n-----------\n\n**FACTS**\n---------\n\n**Undisputed**\n--------------\n\nThis dispute was submitted to ICSID by Mr. Joseph Ch. Lemire - a United States citizen -(\"Claimant\") against Ukraine (\"Respondent\") under the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United States and Ukraine of October 17, 1996 (the \"BIT\").\n\nThe dispute is also governed by an agreement between Claimant and Respondent of March 20, 2000 (the \"Settlement Agreement\") which settled a previous dispute between the Parties under the ICSID Additional Facility (the \"First Arbitration\"). On September 18, 2000, the Settlement Agreement was recorded as an award on agreed terms (the \"2000 Award\").\n\nIn 1995, Claimant invested in CJSC \"Radiocompany Gala\" (\"Gala\") through \"CJCSC \"Mirakom Ukraina\" (\"Mirakom\"). Gala and Mirakom are both closed joint stock companies under Ukrainian law. Initially the majority shareholder, Claimant since 2006 is the sole shareholder of Gala and Mirakom.\n\nClaimant\u2019s recorded investment in Gala is USD 141,000. However, his personal assets are commingled with those of Gala; and his actual contributions into Gala between 1995 and 2008 are estimated by the Majority to cluster somewhere between USD 2 and 3 million (with USD over 5 million alleged by Claimant and some 900,000 conceded by Respondent).\n\nGala is a radio company. Until 2001 focused on Kyiv, it presently broadcasts in 13 regions of Ukraine, reaching some 22 percent of the Ukrainian population. It received 11 of its 14 frequencies on a priority basis pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.\n\nUnder the Law of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting of 1993 (the \"LTR\"), all radio frequencies and attendant licences (summarily \"frequencies\") are awarded by the \"National Television and Radio Council of Ukraine\" (the \"National Council\"). The National Council is independent from the Government of Ukraine, with half of its members appointed by the President and half by the Parliament.\n\nThe National Council awards frequencies in public tenders on the basis of criteria set forth in the LTR. All licensed broadcasters in Ukraine are entitled to participate in these tenders competing for frequencies. Only corporations under Ukrainian law qualify as licensed broadcasters so that foreign investors cannot apply for frequencies in their own right. This regime has been in existence from 1993 to present.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Submission**\n-------------------------\n\nClaimant has submitted that he intended to create three *\"full national networks\".* The National Council in 1995 has nurtured legitimate expectations that he would receive the frequencies necessary for realizing these plans. When these expectations were frustrated and additional grievances occurred, Claimant in November 1997 initiated the First Arbitration eventually settled by the Settlement Agreement.\n\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Claimant received 11 frequencies as negotiated, but later than negotiated and with lower power than expected. Due to their low power, Gala\u2019s frequencies were insufficient to create the envisioned national networks.\n\nDuring 2001 to 2008, Gala applied in tenders for additional frequencies. All these applications but one were denied.\n\nThereupon, Claimant has initiated this arbitration in September 2006. He has sought USD million 55,173 for loss of profits due to alleged breaches of the BIT and the Settlement Agreement preventing him from creating the envisaged national networks1.\n\nClaimant has sought additional relief not relevant to my Opinion.\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Submission**\n---------------------------\n\nRespondent has sought dismissal of all claims. It has denied any violation of either the BIT or the Settlement Agreement. The claims are beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. They are moreover precluded by the Settlement Agreement and on procedural grounds. Finally, Claimant has failed to proof his loss.\n\n**The Majority\u2019s Award**\n------------------------\n\nThe Majority awards Claimant USD 8,717,860 plus USD 750,000 on costs. The award is based on Respondent\u2019s assumed breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard of the BIT (the \"FET standard\") due to the National Council\u2019s failure of awarding Gala the frequencies needed for creating a full national network. All claims under the Settlement Agreement are dismissed.\n\nThe Award comprises two decisions - the *\"Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\u2019\u2019 of* January 14, 2010 (the \"First Decision\") and the Award of March 2011(the \"Award\"). My Opinion concerns both the First Decision and the Award.\n\nThe First Decision establishes Respondent\u2019s liability in principle. It determines that the National Council\u2019s denial of Gala\u2019s applications for frequencies in three tenders between May 2004 and February 2008 have violated the FET standard. Moreover, the First Decision declares the practice of awarding frequencies during March 1999 through June 2000 to have breached the FET standard. During this period (the \"Interregnum\"), the National Council had not been operative and a Government agency had allotted frequencies without tender to broadcasters other than Gala.\n\nThe Award calculates the compensation due to Claimant on the basis of Respondent\u2019s liability as determined in the First Decision. For that purpose, the Majority relies solely on the practice during the Interregnum, The Majority concludes that Gala would have won additional 14 frequencies needed for creating one full national FM network if the frequencies during the Interregnum had been put to tender as required by law so that Gala could have applied for them.\n\nMy objections concern the Majority\u2019s disregard of the Settlement Agreement, the admission of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit on account of Gala, the delineation of the FET standard beyond its scope, the introduction of administrative practices during the Interregnum as a basis of Respondent\u2019s liability, the assumption of causation between such practices and Claimant\u2019s loss, and the award of loss of speculative profits.\n\n**SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n------------------------\n\nThe Majority ignores the Settlement Agreement in determining Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard. It thus disregards the Agreement\u2019s negative *res judicata* effect.\n\n**Terms**\n---------\n\nClaimant\u2019s grievances on account of Respondent\u2019s failure of awarding expected frequencies had already been at issue in the previous arbitration. They were settled by the Settlement Agreement. Under its para. 12, the Parties expressly acknowledge the absence of *\"any claims or misunderstandings....as on the date on the signing of the Agreement\",* i.e., March 20, 2000.\n\nThe Interregnum lasted from March 16, 1999 through June 2000. Any claims that might have arisen during the first 12 months of the Interregnum have thus been waived. Claimant, having the burden of proof, has not shown that any frequencies available for Gala had been allocated during the 3 months remaining after the cut-off-date. The waiver hence covers all claims on account of the Interregnum.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement further *\"supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings...with respect to matters covered herein\"* (para. 27). Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans derive from correspondence and negotiations on the allocation of frequencies in 1995-1997. They are thus superseded.\n\n**Object and Purpose**\n----------------------\n\nAs its express terms, *object* and *purpose* of the Settlement Agreement preclude the aforementioned claims and plans from consideration in this arbitration. By virtue of the Agreement, Claimant received 11 frequencies (out of his present 14) on a priority basis. These frequencies covered the very same regions for which Claimant sought frequencies in his 1995 -1997 negotiations. In return for this priority treatment (at variance with applicable law), Claimant waived all claims, expectations and legally relevant plans ensuing from his 1995 - 1997 negotiations. This *quid pro quo* represents the basic synallagma of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nClaimant had expected that the frequencies obtained pursuant to the Settlement Agreement would suffice to create his envisaged national network. This expectation foundered due to lower-than-aspired powers of the frequencies received. The Majority founds its award on an assumption of additional frequencies which Gala/Claimant should have received during the Interregnum to offset the lower-than-expected power of the frequencies under the Settlement Agreement. Thus, the Majority places Claimant in the same position as if he had successfully negotiated the power of the frequencies under the Settlement Agreement. The FET protection is construed to *de facto* amend the Settlement Agreement. This defeats the latter\u2019s very purpose.\n\n**Res Judicata**\n----------------\n\nRecorded as an award on agreed terms, the Settlement Agreement assumes *res judicata* status. It precludes awarding claims and considering plans in this arbitration that were waived in and superseded by the Agreement. By ignoring the *res judicata effect* of the Settlement Agreement, the Majority exceeds its powers.\n\n**SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT**\n-------------------------------\n\nAs per the Majority\u2019s decision, the out-of-tender allocations of frequencies during the Interregnum breached the FET standard by depriving Gala of its right to participate in tenders required by Ukrainian law. This right belonged to Gala owing to its status as a licensed broadcaster in Ukraine. Claimant has brought this right under the umbrella of the FET standard by invoking it under the BIT in his capacity as a United States investor.\n\nGala is a joint stock corporation under Ukrainian law, Claimant Gala\u2019s controlling shareholder. Exercising a right of Gala in his own name, Claimant has filed a *\"shareholder derivative suit\".*\n\nUkrainian legislation reserves the status of a licensed broadcaster to corporate entities under Ukrainian law to the exclusion of foreign investors in their own right. This restriction imposed Gala\u2019s corporate veil on Claimant as condition of investing in the Ukrainian radio industry.\n\nIn the Annex to the BIT, Ukraine *\"reserves its right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment\".* This Reservation applies to the radio sector; and it covers the aforementioned restriction. As a consequence, BIT protection does not extend to Gala\u2019s corporate rights under Ukrainian radio sector legislation.\n\nThe determined breach of the FET standard is founded on a violation of such rights, namely Gala\u2019s - assumed - rights to opportunities of winning frequencies illegally diverted from the tender process required by relevant legislation. Since such rights fall outside the ambit of BIT protection, their violation cannot be grounds for a breach of Claimant\u2019s rights as a United States investor under the FET standard.\n\nThe Majority objects that Respondent has not adequately pleaded the inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit. However, Respondent has undisputedly submitted the BIT (including the Reservation) and relevant Ukrainian legislation. In my view, the Tribunal was ex officio charged with determining the scope of BIT protection on the basis of the *iura novit curia* maxim.\n\nAdjudicating a claim beyond the BIT\u2019S scope of protection, the Majority exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers.\n\n**FET STANDARD**\n----------------\n\nThe Majority interprets the FET standard broadly with respect to both its scope of protection and the legal consequences of its violation. The standard is liberally construed as an \"umbrella clause\" upgrading \"blatant\" violations of the host country\u2019s tender legislation *ipso iure* to international delicts even absent any specific relation to Claimant, let alone to Claimant as a foreign investor. The standard is moreover developed towards empowering tribunals ex *aequo et bono* to generate international case law superseding municipal laws in point even where they conform to *general principles of law recognized by civilized nations* (Art. 38(1) ICJ Statute).\n\nThe Majority ignores particular features of the scenario in this arbitration which suggest judicial self-restraint in delineating the FET standard with a view to reconciling BIT protection with conflicting public interests of the host country.\n\n**Tender Scenario**\n-------------------\n\nThis arbitration concerns the treatment of Gala in public tenders. In these, Gala, itself a \"corporate citizen\" of Ukraine, competes with domestically-owned radio companies for market shares through allocation of frequencies.\n\nIn such tenders, a *\"level playing field\"* is essential where all contenders compete under the same framework conditions. Any preference accorded to some contenders tends to translate into *\"reverse discrimination\"* of other contenders. It thus undermines fair competition in and effectiveness of the tender process.\n\nBIT protection accords protection to beneficiary investors in addition to the protection afforded to domestic investors and foreign investors without BIT protection by the laws of the host country. This is legitimate. However, BIT protection must be reconciled with the rights of contenders to fair competition and the host country\u2019s reserved regulatory powers.\n\nThis aspect militates against developing a protection level under the FET standard which grants BIT protected investors a competitive advantage over their contenders without such protection. Added protection can distort competition.\n\nTender applications represent investments in opportunities. Multiple contenders apply - only one can win. The economics of tender applications are determined by the chances of winning relative to the risk of losing the resources invested in the application. Legal protection and recovery rights in particular reduce the risk of loss. Where recovery rights extend to loss of profits, as awarded by the Majority, they even increase the chances of winning - not the award as such but the profits which would have accrued from the award. Such rights tend to enhance the risk-return ratio of tender applications. And if they are granted to selected applicants, e.g., BIT protected applicants, they tend to accord these applicants competitive advantages over their contenders.\n\nRecovery rights of unsuccessful tender applicants imply considerable liability risks for the State. Typically multiple contenders apply so that any irregularity may trigger multiple claims. These can accumulate to incalculable liability avalanches.\n\nMunicipal laws therefore tend to restrict recovery rights in tenders with a view to containing fiscal exposure to liability. For instance, European law provides only for recovery of the costs incurred in relation to the tender *(damnum emergens)* but not for recovery of loss of profits *(lucrum cessans)* as awarded by the Majority.\n\nSuch restrictions must be taken into consideration in applying the FET standard to tenders for two reasons. Disregard of such restrictions may widen the gap between the protection of BIT protected applicants and their contenders with prejudice to fair competition. And such restrictions reflect a - widely accepted - public interest of limiting exposure to liability at taxpayer\u2019s expense.\n\n**Reservation**\n---------------\n\nThe particular dynamics of tenders legitimate the aforementioned restrictions on foreign investments in the radio industry established by Ukrainian sector legislation and covered by Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to national treatment. In essence, these restrictions seek to exclude broadcasters\u2019 rights in relation to tenders for frequencies from BIT protection. This assures a level playing field for all contenders and forestalls unforeseeable liabilities in accordance with practices in Europe and elsewhere. Ukraine accords these public interests in the radio sector priority over the investment promotion purpose of the BIT reflected in the latter\u2019s preamble.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s opinion, the Reservation has *\"no bearing whatsoever for the resolution of the present dispute\".* its application must be strictly confined to national treatment and has no ramifications for the FET standard.\n\nThis position in my view overlooks the substantive overlap between the national treatment and the FET standard, respectively. Authorizing less advantageous treatment of U.S. Investors than of domestic investors, the Reservation a *fortiori* militates against converting the FET standard into a right to preferential treatment of U.S. Investors over their domestic contenders, the noncontingent nature of FET notwithstanding.\n\nI do not wish to suggest that the Reservation excludes tenders from FET protection in all conceivable scenarios. Yet, the Reservation in my view commands restraint in expanding the standard with respect to tender situations, especially in relation to an administrative practice affecting U.S. and domestically-owned radio companies alike.\n\nExpanding the FET standard to an \"umbrella clause\" for tender violations without regard to the special tender scenario or the Reservation, the Majority in my view stretches the standard beyond its *object* and *purpose* in the *context* of the BIT. It thus exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers.\n\n**INTERREGNUM**\n---------------\n\n**Ne Ultra Petita**\n-------------------\n\nThe First Decision declaring out-of-tender allocations of frequencies during the National Council\u2019s inoperativeness (the \"Interregnum\") in breach of the FET standard represents a \"surprise decision\". It has no basis in Claimant\u2019s pleadings.\n\nClaimant had referred to this practice in the context of his claims for alleged non-performance of the Settlement Agreement. However, he has not, prior to the First Decision, asserted any claim on account of the administrative practice during the Interregnum. Only in response to the First Decision did Claimant amend his pleadings to include claims due to the Interregnum. These *post facto* pleadings cannot retroactively establish the procedural basis of the Majority\u2019s decision.\n\nThe decision violates the fundamental arbitration principle of *ne ultra petita.* it thus exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers.\n\n**Audiatur et Altera Pars**\n---------------------------\n\nBy introducing a liability not pleaded by Claimant, the Majority deprives Respondent of its Right to be Heard on this issue. Respondent could not submit its defence in time to avert the decision.\n\nRespondent\u2019s submission (including documentary evidence) in response to the decision revealed major errors concerning the Majority\u2019s assumptions. Since the decision established Respondent\u2019s liability as *res judicata* for the award, Respondent\u2019s *post facto* submission was of no avail. It cannot cure the *departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.*\n\n**Claims Waived**\n-----------------\n\nThe Interregnum in most part preceded the Settlement Agreement. Claims on account of occurrences during the Interregnum have thus been waived by the Settlement Agreement.\n\n**Venire Contra Factum Proprium**\n---------------------------------\n\nCo-terminus with the Interregnum, Claimant negotiated the Settlement Agreement which granted him 11 frequencies on a priority basis. Claimant\u2019s priority treatment was negotiated with the Government during the National Council\u2019s inoperativeness; and it impaired the opportunities of contenders under applicable law for the frequencies concerned. Claimant thus negotiated to his benefit a practice similar to the Interregnum practice on account of which he seeks FET protection. His claim is *estopped* as a *venire contra factum proprium.*\n\nThe Majority dismisses this aspect arguing that the Settlement Agreement just *\"rebalanced\"* injustice done to Claimant. However, settling an - assumed - injustice to Claimant cannot justify doing injustice to innocent stakeholders, i.e., Gala\u2019s contenders. The FET standard cannot legitimate compensating foreign investors at the expense of domestic.\n\n**FET Standard as Umbrella Clause**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Majority grounds its decision solely on a violation of applicable Ukrainian legislation assumedly entitling radio broadcasters to the allocation of frequencies in transparent tenders. Gala is affected - only - in its capacity as a licensed broadcaster in Ukraine, alongside with all other Ukrainian radio companies at the time (except the few benefiting from the practice). The violation entails no discrimination of Claimant, let alone of Claimant as a U.S. Investor.\n\nThe FET standard is - in my view inadmissibly - extended to general administrative framework conditions of the host country unrelated to Claimant.\n\n**AWARD**\n---------\n\n**Majority Decision**\n---------------------\n\nThe Majority determines the award of compensation solely on the basis of the frustration of Gala\u2019s opportunities during the Interregnum. It concludes that Gala would have won 14 frequencies needed to create a *\"full national FM network\"* had the frequencies allotted during the Interregnum been awarded in public tenders in compliance with the law. Without reviewing any particular allocations of frequencies, the Majority reasons its conclusion with Gala\u2019s popularity in Kyiv in 1999 and presentations of Claimant and his collaborators on Gala\u2019s program.\n\nThe Majority then proceeds with estimating Gala\u2019s loss of profits in terms of the balance between Gala\u2019s actual net enterprise value (USD 126,290) and its hypothetical net enterprise value if Gala\u2019s *full national network* had been operative as of January 1, 2001 (USD 8,844,150). in this way, the Majority arrives at a loss of profits in the amount of USD 8,717,850. This amount is awarded to Claimant, plus USD 750,000 compensation of costs of this arbitration.\n\nThis decision - in my view implausibly - construes causation between Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing during the Interregnum and Gala\u2019s hypothetical *full national network',* and it awards (highly) speculative profits.\n\n**Causation**\n-------------\n\nThe Majority refers to the concept of *\"transitive causation\"* and distinguishes between two causal links, namely (i) the link between Respondent\u2019s practice during the Interregnum *(\"the cause\")* and Gala\u2019s hypothetical *full national network* and (ii) the link between such network and Gala\u2019s loss of profits (the final *effect).* I agree with this conceptual approach in principle. I disagree, however, with the Majority\u2019s application of this concept to tender situations and analysis of the facts at hand.\n\n***Causation in Tenders***\n--------------------------\n\nInternational law, as far as ascertained, does not offer special rules for determining recovery in case of flawed or illegally averted tenders. Municipal laws do. They indicate *general principles of law* to be taken into account in interpreting more general international law principles (Article 38(1)(c) ICJ Statute). European and German laws offer examples in point.\n\nThe EU *Sector Surveillance Directive* provides for recovery of costs incurred in relation to public tenders infringing on EU law. It does not, though, envision any recovery of loss of profits. Even recovery of costs is conditional on proof of a *real chance* in a particular tender.\n\nGerman case law jurisprudence under the Roman law doctrine of *culpa in contrahendo* awards loss of profits in tender situations. However, it requires for that purpose proof with a *\"probability bordering at certainty\"* that the plaintiff **would** have won the particular tender concerned but for the violation asserted.\n\nThese restrictions serve an obvious purpose - the avoidance of liability avalanches through claims by multiple frustrated tender applicants.\n\nInternational law principles on State responsibility complementing the FET standard include recovery of loss of profits - but only *\"insofar as it is established\"* (Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles). This principle is concretized by precedents requiring *\"particularization\"* of damages and constraining award of *\"speculative profits\".*\n\nIn my view, these principles as shaped in precedents encapsulate limitations on recovery in tender situations typical in municipal laws specifically addressing tenders. At the very least, they militate against liberal assumptions regarding a claimant\u2019s success in tender situations and estimates of profits foregone.\n\n***Analysis of Facts***\n-----------------------\n\nThe Majority has not assessed Gala\u2019s prospects with a view to any particular allocation of frequencies during the Interregnum. It just concludes that Claimant **should** have won the frequencies needed for realizing his business expectations plans; and it accepts Claimant\u2019s affirmation that he would have needed 14 frequencies.\n\nClaimants business expectation plans are precluded by the Settlement Agreement from consideration in this arbitration (supra). The Majority\u2019s assessment thus ignores the *res judicata* effect of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nFailing to *particularize* Gala\u2019s opportunities in tenders if held in compliance with the law, the Majority\u2019s assessment is inconclusive.\n\nIn its guidance to the Parties, the Tribunal had indicated that compensation would be determined on an assessment of Gala\u2019s chances in particular tenders. The perfunctory summary assessment, relying entirely on submissions during the first phase of the proceedings and on Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans, represents a *\"surprise decision\"* inconsistent with the maxim of *party equality.*\n\nFinally, the Majority liberally estimates Claimant\u2019s foregone profits by benchmarking Gala\u2019s hypothetical financial performance (if it had created a full national network) against the performance of the four most successful radio companies in Ukraine. This approach departs from the international precedents against awarding speculative profits; and it contrasts the restrictions under municipal laws on the recovery of *lucrum cessans* in tender situations.\n\n**Plausibility of Findings**\n----------------------------\n\nThe Majority\u2019s findings are implausible.\n\nThe Majority concludes that Gala would have won 14 frequencies during the Interregnum if the administrative practice had complied with the law, although:\n\n\u25a0 At most some 20 frequencies were available for award to Gala so that Gala would have had to score a success rate of some 70 percent against potentially all Ukrainian radio companies at the time;\n\n\u25a0 As late as 2006, no private radio company in Ukraine had operated a *full national network* as Gala is found to have achieved in 2001 but for the assumed deprivation of its opportunities;\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s market position in Kyiv relied on by the Majority eroded from no. 1 in 1999 to no.15 in 2010;\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s recorded capital was clearly inadequate and its off-the-record funding by Claimant was not transparent.\n\nFourteen frequencies (in addition to Gala\u2019s present 13) would in the Majority\u2019s estimate have multiplied Gala\u2019s enterprise value seventy-times its present. Such foregone hypothetical profits compare with past actual losses of Gala exceeding USD 2 million during 1995 - 2010. In my view, this reflects audacious speculation.\n\nThe Majority in my opinion stretches the recovery of loss due to a breach of the FET standard beyond the limits set by applicable principles of international law. It thus again exceeds the powers of the Tribunal.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n---------------\n\nIn my opinion, the Majority exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers by\n\n\u25a0 Failing to recognize the *res judicata* effect of the Settlement Agreement;\n\n\u25a0 Admitting Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit on account of Gala;\n\n\u25a0 Construing the FET standard beyond its scope of protection;\n\n\u25a0 Introducing a liability of Respondent on account of the Interregnum without basis in Claimant\u2019s pleading (ne *ultra petita)',*\n\n\u25a0 Construing *causation* between Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard and Claimant\u2019s loss at variance with established principles of international law and municipal laws in point; and\n\n\u25a0 Awarding \"speculative profits\".\n\nMoreover, the Majority departs from fundamental rules of procedure by\n\n\u25a0 Depriving Respondent of its *Right to be Heard* with the \"surprise decision\" regarding the Interregnum; and\n\n\u25a0 Violating the principle of *Equality of Parties* in its determination of causation between Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing and Claimant\u2019s loss.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s decision in my view sets an unfortunate precedent by\n\n\u25a0 Discouraging the amicable settlement of investment disputes;\n\n\u25a0 Side-stepping Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to BIT protection safeguarding the regulation of a sensitive sector;\n\n\u25a0 Overstretching the FET standard into an ex *aequo et bono* empowerment of tribunals to supersede municipal laws by international case law jurisprudence;\n\n\u25a0 Ignoring restrictions of municipal laws and international law principles widely recognized to safeguard legitimate public interests;\n\n\u25a0 Construing BIT protection towards unduly privileging foreign-owned enterprises over domestically-owned competitors; and\n\n\u25a0 Leading to a divergence of international law from municipal laws.\n\nCONTENT\n-------\n\n**GLOSSARY**\n------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Audio | Audio procedural conference of March 1,2010 |\n| Award | The Final Award in ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18 dated March |\n| BIT | 2011 Treaty between the United States of America and Ukraine concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment which entered into force on November 16, 1966 |\n| Claimant | Mr. Joseph Charles Lemire, a United States citizen |\n| CMRI | Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues |\n| Critique | The Majority\u2019s Comments on this Separate Opinion (ch. 11.2 of the Award) |\n| Cf. | Compare |\n| Douglas | Zachary Douglas, *\"The International Law of Investment* *Claims\",* Cambridge 2009 |\n| EBS | EBS Expertise Services |\n| EBSR | EBS Report on Damages of November 3, 2008 |\n| EBSSR | EBS Supplementary Report of June 21, 2010 |\n| FET | Fair and Equitable Treatment |\n| First Arbitration | Investment Arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility between Claimant and Respondent filed on November 14, 1997 and settled by the Settlement Agreement (Case No. ARB(AF)/98/) |\n| First Decision | Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated January 14, 2010 in ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18 |\n| Fn. | Footnote |\n| Frequency | Radio frequency, including all licences required to broadcast on a frequency |\n| Gala | CJSC \"Radiocompany Gala\" |\n| Garni | *GAMI Investments.

If subsequently changes have been Introduced Into that draft, references to the Majority\u2019s position in my Opinion may have become inaccurate.\n\nI had agreed with my colleagues to state my entire Separate Opinion together with the Award.\n\n3.\n\nMy disagreement with the First Decision concentrates on aspects and conclusions of Section VII of that Decision4, namely the Majority\u2019s determinations regarding Respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT on account of Gala\u2019s treatment with respect to the allocation of radio frequencies and broadcasting licences (hereinafter summarily referred to as \"frequencies\").\n\nSee para. 513 of the First Decision\n\n4.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Majority decides that Gala\u2019s treatment with respect to the award of frequencies breached the FET Standard of Article 11.3 of the BIT in four instances5. My dissent from this Decision flows from three overriding legal aspects ignored by the Majority, namely:\n\n(I) The preclusion of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations and business expansion plans from consideration in this arbitration by virtue of the Settlement Agreement;\n\n(II) The inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit on account of Gala, a Ukrainian corporation, by virtue of Respondent\u2019s Reservation to National Treatment in the Annex to the BIT and the exercise of this Reservation by Ukrainian radio sector legislation; and\n\n(III) The limitations of the scope of the FET standard in light of (i) the particular dynamics of tenders where BIT protected investors compete with domestic investors and (ii) Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to National Treatment as exercised.\n\nSee para. 513 (3) in conjunction with para. 421 of the First Decision.\n\n5.\n\nIn chapters IV through VI, I review the Majority\u2019s pertinent assessment of the facts at hand in light of the conclusions from chapters I through III with a focus on aspects ignored by the Majority. My key points are:\n\n(IV) The imperfections of Ukrainian legislation in relation to tenders for frequencies were already embodied in the initial version of the Law of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting of December 21, 1993 (the \"LTR\"). Claimant has acquiesced with this legislative environment, including its imperfections, when he started his investment in 1995.\n\n(V) in assessing Gala\u2019s success record in tenders, the frequencies awarded under the Settlement Agreement must be taken into account. Gala\u2019s failures can be explained by reasons pervading all pertinent tender decisions, notably Gala\u2019s undercapitalisation, its limited technical capacities and its lack of program innovation.\n\n(VI) The administrative practice during March 1999 through June 2000 with respect to the allocation of frequencies when the National Council was inoperative (the \"Interregnum\") should not have been considered in this arbitration on procedural grounds (ne *ultra petita, audiatur et altera pars).* it moreover does not violate any rights of Claimant under the FET standard of the BIT; and\n\n(VII) The National Council\u2019s decisions in the Tenders during May 2004 through February 2008 do not represent *arbitrary or arbitrary measures* against Claimant and, in any case, do not justify any inference with respect to the Interregnum.\n\n6.\n\nIn PART TWO of my Opinion, I address the Award and submit that the Majority\n\n(I) Establishes *causation* between the Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing during the Interregnum and Claimant\u2019s loss at variance with international law principles and municipal laws in point;\n\n(II) Awards *speculative profits',* and\n\n(III) Misconstrues the principle *\"the loser pays\"* in allocating costs.\n\n7.\n\nPART THREE of my Opinion comments on the Majority\u2019s critique of my Opinion incorporated in the Award.\n\n**PART ONE: THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY OF JANUARY 14, 2010 (THE \"FIRST DECISION\")**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. CLAIMANT\u2019S LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OF MARCH 20, 2000(THE \"SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\")**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.A. Majority Position and Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.A.1. Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimant has built his case for a breach of the FET standard in the allocation of frequencies on the allegation that at the time he made his initial investment in 1995, *\"he had a legitimate expectation that he would be authorized to increase the size and audience of his radio company, and to establish three radio networks in Ukraine aimed at three different age groups. This plan had been discussed with the National Council members and was encouraged by them\"6.* As evidence, Claimant has submitted correspondence between the National Council, the State Inspection on Electric Communications and himself dated 1995 as well as a draft \"Plan of Measures\" negotiated between Claimant and the National Council in 19977. In the words of the Majority, *\"the main thrust of Claimant\u2019s submission is that his legitimate expectations were thwarted by Ukraine\u2019s actions in violation of the BIT\"8.*\n\nPara. 210 of the First Decision\n\nPara. 211 of the First Decision\n\nPara. 212 of the First Decision\n\n**I.A.2. Majority**\n-------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn light of this submission, the Majority relates the notion of legitimate expectations to the FET standard of the BIT9.\"..... *the FET standard is thus closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations - actions or omissions by Ukraine are contrary to the FET Standard if they frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations on which the investor relied at the time when he made the investment\"10.*\n\nParas. 264 - 271 of the First Decision\n\nPara. 264 of the First Decision\n\n10.\n\nThe Majority defines Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations on a general and on a specific level. *\"On a general level, Claimant could expect a regulatory system for the broadcasting industry which was to be consistent, transparent, fair, reasonable and enforced without arbitrary or discriminatory decisions\"11.\"And on a more specific and personal level, Mr. Lemire undoubtedly had the legitimate expectation that Gala, which at that time was only a local station in Kyiv, would be allowed to expand, in parallel with the growth of the private radio industry in Ukraine\"12.*\n\nPara. 267 of the First Decision.\n\nPara. 268 of the First Decsion.\n\n11.\n\nNow the Majority proceeds to analyse Claimant\u2019s business expectations plans, concluding that *\"the available evidence shows that what Mr. Lemire had in mind when he bought into Gala Radio in June 1995, was to convert Gala into a national broadcaster and to create a second AM channel (...)\"13.* in summarizing its elaboration on the FET standard, the Majority again refers to \"the legitimate expectations of the investor, at the time he made his investment\"14.\n\nPara. 270 of the First Decision.\n\nPara. 285 of the First Decision.\n\n**I.A.3. Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n12.\n\nRespondent objects to consideration of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations and business expansion plans. Presented in Respondent Counsel\u2019s Opening Statement of the December 8 - 12, 2008 Hearings15, these objections are based on the terms of the Settlement Agreement between Claimant and Respondent of March 20, 2000 settling the previous arbitral proceedings between the Parties under the ICSID Additional Facility (Case No. ARB(AF)/98/1)16 (the \"First Arbitration\").\n\nSee Hearing Transcript, pp. 50 - 53.\n\nSee para. 33 of the First Decision.\n\n13.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Settlement Agreement referred to by Respondent are:\n\n\u25a0 Clause 10: *\"The Parties agree and confirm that all the claims, complaints and requests contained in the Consent to Arbitrate, Notice of Arbitration, Ancillary Claims and all other official letters of the Claimant to the Respondent or ICSID, as well as other correspondence of the Claimant addressed to third parties are hereby settled\".*\n\n\u25a0 Clause 11: *\"By such settlement the Parties, in the event of compliance with this Agreement, exclude all of the claims referred to in Item 10 of Section II \"Settlement of the Dispute\" from any further judicial or arbitration Settlement\u2019-,* and\n\n\u25a0 Clause 12: *\"The Parties acknowledge the absence of any claims or misunderstandings between them as on the date of signing this Agreement\"17.*\n\nSee Exhibits CM - 12 and 13 as well as Respondent\u2019s power point presentation at the Hearing Dec. 8, 2008, p. 5 -7.\n\n14.\n\nFrom these provisions, Respondent concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s analysis should start from the terms of the Settlement Agreement rather than from correspondence dated 1995 and 1997: *\"I think this is logically where the Tribunal would want to start their analysis because, (...) if the Tribunal finds that there was no breach of the prior settlement award, you do not look at anything that happened before the settlement award in terms of there being a breach because the settlement agreement cleared the decks as of the date of itself\"18.*\n\nSee Hearing Transcript, p. 50.\n\n**I.B. My View**\n----------------\n\n15.\n\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s statement regarding Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations of a general nature - albeit subject to three caveats:\n\n\u25a0 The regulatory system was already in place when Claimant started his investment. He could not expect more fairness and transparency than provided by the existing system (paras. 158-161 infra);\n\n\u25a0 Through Respondent\u2019s Reservation to National Treatment, Claimant was warned of possible measures to the detriment of foreign investors in the radio industry (paras. 134 -137 infra); and\n\n\u25a0 Only Gala, a corporation of Ukrainian law, was licensed to broadcast in Ukraine so that the entitlement to regulatory fairness may not in all circumstances accrue to Claimant in his own right (paras. 79 - 89 infra).\n\n16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s objection relates to the consideration of Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans in the context of legitimate expectations in the present arbitration. So does my concern.\n\n17.\n\nLegitimate expectations are established at the time when the pertinent investment is made19, and as a matter of logic, they can as such not be altered subsequently. To this extent, I agree with the Majority. The Majority, in my view errs, however, when it accepts expectations related to business expansion for its analysis of Claimant\u2019s treatment under the FET provision of the BIT subsequent to the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee *Teemed v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award of May 9, 2003, para. 360; *LG&E v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006, para. 127; *Duke Energy v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award of August 12, 2008, para. 340 and *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award of August 24, 2009, para. 129.\n\n**I.B.1. Terms of the Settlement Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nClaimant\u2019s entitlement to frequencies under the FET provision of the BIT was at issue in the First Arbitration. This Arbitration was amicably settled by the Settlement Agreement signed on March 20, 2000 and recorded as an award on agreed terms on September 18, 2000 (ICSID No. ARB(AF)/98/1)20. By virtue of clause 13 (b) of the Settlement Agreement, Claimant received frequencies in eleven cities on a priority basis21. These eleven cities coincide with the cities specified in the correspondence between the National Council and the State Inspection on Electronic Communications, cc\u2019d to Claimant, of 18 July and 18 October 199522 as well as in a draft \"Plan of Measures\" negotiated between Claimant and the National Council in 1997, but never signed23.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Request for (the First) Arbitration, para. 27 and Claimant\u2019s Ancillary Claims of October 13, 1998 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM - 18), pp. 5, 6.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibits CM - 19, 20.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibits CM - 1,2.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM - 8 at para. 2.\n\n19.\n\nThe aforementioned correspondence and draft Plan of Measures had been submitted by Claimant as the documented basis of his legitimate expectations; and the Majority refers to these documents in this context24. While these documents specify the cities for which Claimant expected frequencies, they do not entail any reference to further expectations of Claimant.\n\nSee paras. 210,211 of the First Decision.\n\n20.\n\nSince the allocation of frequencies was *\"contained in the Consent to Arbitrate, Notice of Arbitration, Ancillary Claims\"* [of the settled First Arbitration], it falls within the purview of clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement. This is all the more obvious, as the Settlement Agreement accords Claimant priority to frequencies for the very same cities on which his initial business interest and discussions with the National Council had concentrated.\n\n21.\n\nAs the aforementioned correspondence, the Settlement Agreement does not entail any reference to interests of Claimant in additional frequencies. To the contrary, under clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement the Parties *\"acknowledge the absence of any claims*  ***or misunderstandings***  *between them as on the date of signing this Agreement\"* (emphasis provided). This provision is reinforced by clause 27 of the Settlement Agreement which provides that *\"This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the subject matter hereof*  ***and supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings between them with respect to the matters covered herein\"*** (emphasis provided).\n\n22.\n\nIn the absence of any opening clause in the Settlement Agreement, any claims with respect to further frequencies could hence not be based on or affected by *\"any correspondence, negotiations or understandings\"* pre-dating the Settlement Agreement.\n\n23.\n\nThe relevance of Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans ensues from his negotiations and alleged understandings at the time when the investment was made, i.e., in 1995 - 199725. This basis was precluded from consideration in the present arbitral proceedings by the clear terms of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee paras. 40 - 53 infra for details\n\n**I.B.2. Synallagma of the Settlement Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Majority confines *object* and *purpose* of the Settlement Agreement to the specific claims withdrawn by Claimant pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.\n\n25.\n\nTo understand the *\"quid pro quo\"* underlying the Settlement Agreement, though, the aforementioned provisions precluding further claims must be related to paragraph 13 of the Settlement Agreement, especially clause 13 (b). Absent this covenant, Claimant would under applicable Ukrainian law have had no right to any preferential treatment in competing with (domestic and foreign) applicants for radio frequencies. Rather, he would have had to rely on his success in tender proceedings under the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting of December 21, 1993 (the \"LTR\")26. By virtue of the paragraph 13 (b), Claimant received on a priority basis eleven radio frequencies and licences - out of the fourteen frequencies and licences which he held at the close of the present arbitral proceedings. The frequencies obtained via the Settlement Agreement covered precisely the areas in the focus of his initial business interest.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s RLA - 2 for a partial translation of this law and para. 28 infra.\n\n26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s priority to these eleven frequencies came at the expense of Claimant\u2019s (mainly domestically-owned) competitors that were denied an opportunity to win these frequencies in tenders under the LTR. Respondent had accorded Claimant this significant business advantage for the obvious purpose of settling the First Arbitration and achieving legal certainty. Priority for specific frequencies in return for settlement of all alleged previous expectations of frequencies was fundamental to the synallagma of the Settlement Agreement. By relying on Claimant\u2019s negotiations pre-dating the Settlement Agreement in the present arbitration, the Majority defeats the very purpose of the Settlement Agreement against its clear terms.\n\n**I.B.3. Background of the Settlement Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe synallagma of the Settlement Agreement flows from the previous negotiations between Claimant and the National Council regarding the allocation of frequencies. In early 1995, Claimant assumed negotiations with the National Council with the aim of attaining frequencies for particular regions of Ukraine. These negotiations culminated in the 1995 correspondence and the 1997 draft Plan of Measures on which the Majority bases Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. In essence, Claimant tried to obtain frequencies directly out of tender or at least to secure a favourable consideration of his business expansion plans in tender decisions.\n\n28.\n\nThe LTR provides that frequencies and broadcasting licenses (summarily referred to as \"frequencies\") are awarded by the National Council on the basis of tenders open to all broadcasters licensed in Ukraine. Derogation from this process is allowed only where expressly authorized by LTR27. The criteria for awarding frequencies are set forth in the LTR28. Applicants\u2019 business expansion plans do not belong to these criteria.\n\nArticle 23 (6) of the LTR. This regime was already enshrined in the initial 1993 version oft he LTR.\n\nArticle 25 (14) of the LTR.\n\n29.\n\nThe integrity of the tender process as an open competition of all contenders required assessment of all applications in a level playing field with **exclusive** reliance on the criteria provided in the LTR. Any consideration of individual business plans would have amounted to reverse discrimination of contenders whose expansion plans were not taken into account; and it would have undermined the effectiveness of the tender process in selecting the best contenders in terms of the criteria enshrined in the law29. Giving credit to Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans would have amounted to according preferential treatment to an individual contender against the tenets of the tender process.\n\nThis aspect is further developed in paras. 115-120 Infra.\n\n30.\n\nWith the First Arbitration, Claimant had sought the allocation of frequencies to which he had felt himself entitled due to alleged legitimate expectations emanating from his aforementioned negotiations with the National Council. The Settlement Agreement tried to reconcile Claimant\u2019s alleged entitlement due to legitimate expectations with Respondent\u2019s interest in the integrity of the tender system for frequencies. To strike this balance, Respondent accorded Claimant priority with respect to the frequencies enumerated in clause 13 (b) of the Settlement Agreement30. As a corollary, Claimant\u2019s priority treatment was confined to these frequencies. Upon award of these frequencies, Claimant, with respect to applications for additional frequencies, was to be treated in strict compliance with the LTR on an equal footing with all other tender applicants. Thus, the integrity of the tender system was to be restored.\n\nTo avoid an explicit violation of the LTR, the priority was veiled behind formal compliance with the procedures of the LTR.\n\n31.\n\nAgainst this background, clause 10, 11, 12 and 27 make it plain that Claimant could not invoke any alleged expectations or plans established prior to the Settlement Agreement in his quest for frequencies in addition to those enumerated in clause 13 (b). With his signature of the Settlement Agreement, Claimant has waived any future consideration of such expectations or plans, subject to Respondent\u2019s performance of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n**I.B.4. Claimant\u2019s Waiver of his Expectations with respect to Business Expansion**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nNo previous ICSID award has seemingly addressed the effect of a subsequent agreement on an investor\u2019s rights under the FET standard in reliance on legitimate expectations. This issue in my view must be distinguished from the - established - question regarding the time at which legitimate expectations are established. The fact that Claimant\u2019s expectations were established as of the date when he made the investment (i.e., in 1995) did not prevent him from subsequently waiving the effect of his legitimate expectations on his legal position, including his protection under the FET standard of the BIT, in an agreement with the Host Government.\n\n33.\n\nThis follows in my view from the freedom of contract according to which entitlements (other than inalienable rights) may contractually be waived by those entitled. BITs protect economic rights. As a rule, these are not inalienable but at the disposal of the investor concerned. Claimant, by agreeing to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, waived any entitlement that may have derived from his initial negotiations concerning the allocation of frequencies in return for the award of specified frequencies on a priority basis. After the Settlement Agreement (and Respondent\u2019s compliance with it), Claimant could no longer legitimately expect any consideration of his initial business plans by the National Council in deciding on his tender applications for further frequencies. Whatever they might had been, these expectations and plans have been superseded by the Settlement Agreement and, with the latter\u2019s performance by Respondent, become obsolete.\n\n**I.B.5. Recognition of the Settlement Agreement as an Award on Agreed Terms**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nAs per the request of the Parties, the Settlement Agreement was on September 18, 2000 recorded as an award on agreed terms. It thus obtained the status of an award under Section 4 of the ICSID Convention. According to Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Settlement Agreement was transformed into an *\"award binding on the parties and (...) not subject any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention\".* As a consequence, the Convention\u2019s provisions on recognition and enforcement became applicable to the Settlement Agreement; and its terms became *res judicata* as those of an arbitral decision.31\n\nSee Christoph H. Schreuer et al., *\"The ICSID Convention, A Commentary\",* 2nd ed., Cambridge 2009, article 48, note 79.\n\n35.\n\nThe *res judicata* effect of the Settlement Agreement flows from the ICSID Convention. The latter, together with the BIT and Claimant\u2019s claim as filed *\"constitute the arbitration agreement and therefore prescribe the parameters of the Tribunal\u2019s powers\"32.* The Tribunal thus exceeds its powers if it disregards the (negative) *res judicata* effect of the Settlement Agreement on a matter covered by it.\n\nSee *Helnan International Hotels A/S and Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of May 29, 2010, para. 40.\n\n36.\n\nThe allocation of frequencies is covered by the Settlement Agreement. The latter, according to its clause 27 *\"supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings between* [the Parties] *with respect to the matters covered therein\".* This includes Claimant\u2019s negotiations and correspondence with the National Council relied on by the Majority as basis of Claimant\u2019s expectations and plans.\n\n37.\n\nPursuant to clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement, *\"the Parties acknowledge the absence of any claims or misunderstandings between them as on the date of signing this Agreement\".* The Agreement had been signed on March 20, 2000. Thus, all claims that might have existed on that date have effectively been waived33.\n\nSee paras. 200 - 204 and paras. 407 - 507 infra on the implications for claims awarded.\n\n38.\n\nThe aforementioned issue has been raised by Respondent before the Tribunal. The Majority fails to address it.\n\n39.\n\nIn sum, by awarding claims arisen before March 20, 2000 (paras. 200 - 204 infra) and building its Award on Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans without considering the impact of the Settlement Agreement on these plans, the Majority fails to recognize the *res judicata* effect of an award on agreed terms on a matter fundamental to its Award. The Majority hence exceeds its powers. In my view, it does so *\"manifestly\u2019\u2019,* since the matter is clearly covered by the terms of the Settlement Agreement, is at the core of the Agreement\u2019s synallagma and has been pleaded by Respondent.\n\n**I.B.6. Claimant\u2019s initial Business Expansion Plans**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nEven if I accepted *arguendo* the Majority\u2019s disregard of the Settlement Agreement in determining the implications of Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans for this arbitration, I still would have to disagree with the Majority\u2019s analysis and findings in point. Whatever Claimant might have had in mind, his alleged plans are not supported, let alone legitimated, by the correspondence between the National Council and the Ukrainian State Centre of Radio Frequencies (the \"State Centre\") of July/October 1995.\n\n41.\n\nWhile the Majority focuses on Claimant\u2019s mindset at the time of his investment34, it is generally established that only **legitimate** expectations qualify for protection under the FET standard and that expectations receive their legitimacy from conduct attributable to the host government35. In the words of the *PSEG* Tribunal, *\"legitimate expectations by definition require a promise of the administration on which the Claimants rely to assert a right that needs to be observed\"36.* Similarly, the *Parkerings* Tribunal stated that *\"the expectation is* *legitimate if the investor received an explicit promise or guaranty from the host-State, or if implicitly, the host-State made assurances or representation (...) \".37* Also in line with this jurisprudence is the more recent NAFTA based ad hoc-arbitral decision in *Glamis Gold v. USA: \u2018Article 1105 (1) NAFTA* [the FET standard] *requires the evaluation of whether the State made any specific assurance or commitment to the investor so as to induce the investment\"38*\n\nSee para. 270 of the First Decision: *\"The available evidence shows what Mr. Lemire had in mind when he bought* *into Gala Radio in June 1995...The idea to create a third radio network....seems to have been an* *afterthought\".*\n\nSee loana Tudor, *\"The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in the International Law of Foreign Investment\"* Oxford University Press 2008, pp. 163 et. seq.; and Sebastian Lopez Escarcena, *\"The Elements of Fair and Equitable Treatment in International Investment Law\",* Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies, Policy Brief No. 14, April 2010, p. 6 et seq.; both with further references.\n\nSee *PSEG Global Inc and Konya llgin Elektrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Serketi v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award of January 19, 2007, para. 241.\n\nSee *Parkerings v. Lithuania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award on Jurisdiction and Merits of August 14, 2007, para.331.\n\n*Glamis Gold v. USA,* Ad hoc Arbitration, Award of May 14, 2009, para. 620.\n\n42.\n\nYet, the Majority does not pinpoint any \"promise\" or assurance of Respondent in support of Claimant\u2019s initial business plans; it just states that the National Council and the State Centre *\"reacted positively* to Claimant\u2019s quest for frequencies and were *\"considering the possibility* of issuing them39.\n\nSee para. 270 of the First Decision.\n\n43.\n\nSuch *\"positive reaction\",* in my view too vague as a basis of legitimate expectations, is found in one-sided reliance on Claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\n44.\n\nThe Majority relies primarily on Mr. Lemire\u2019s, the Claimant\u2019s, witness statement that he had from the outset envisaged to create three national networks for three different age groups and to become a *\"national broadcaster\"* able to broadcast throughout the entire territory of Ukraine; and that he \"was *assured by National Council members (...) that he would be able to set up three national networks\"40.*\n\nSee paras. 269 and 270 of the First Decision; First Witness Statement of Joseph Ch. Lemire, para. 12 at p. 4; Mr. Lemire, Hearing Transcript, day 1, p. 121, at 17. Compare Claimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 42 et seq.and 107 et seq.\n\n45.\n\nThe Majority compares this witness statement with the aforementioned correspondence between the National Council and the State Centre (see paras. 12, 13 above) and considers the July 19, 1995 letter of the National Council to the State Centre as evidence that the National Council had been *\"considering the possibility of issuing to Gala licences for a nationwide FM channel and for a second AM Band\".* The Majority further finds that *\"the State Centre reacted positively\"41.*\n\nSee para. 270 of the First Decision.\n\n46.\n\nThis assessment of evidence, however, overlooks three essential facts:\n\n47.\n\nFirstly, the 18 July 1995 letter of the National Council, unlike recorded by the Majority, entails no reference to *\"a nationwide FM channel\".* Rather, the letter just refers to *\"1 radio program within FM 100-108 band\"* in twelve specified cities42. Absent any reference to the concept of a \"nationwide\" FM network, the correspondence between the National Council and the State Centre can in my view not be quoted as evidence of Claimant\u2019s nationwide network expectation.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-1.\n\n48.\n\nSecondly, while the National Council\u2019s inquiry letter of July 18, 1995 also included *\"an AM band: Kyi\\/\u2019,* the 18 October 1995 response letter of the State Centre specified eleven of the twelve cities where FM frequencies were available but did not make any reference to the requested AM frequency for Kyiv43. As the State Centre\u2019s response letter enumerates the cities with available frequencies but fails to mention the AM frequency for Kyiv, it clearly cannot be considered as a positive reaction to the National Council\u2019s inquiry with respect to the AM frequency. In Claimant\u2019s pleading, though, the AM frequency was envisaged to provide the basis for the planned second (talk) network. On that ground, the Majority accepts the reference to this channel as evidence for Claimant\u2019s expectation regarding the second network.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM-2.\n\n49.\n\nThirdly, while the Majority relies on Claimant\u2019s own witness statement, it entirely ignores the statements of Respondent\u2019s witnesses in point. Claimant, according to his initial witness statement, primarily relied on alleged \"assurances\" of Messrs. Viktor Petrenko and Yuriy Plaksyuk, then-Chairman and Member of the National Council, respectively, as a basis for his national coverage and three networks plans44. Yet, in his rebuttal witness statement, Mr. Petrenko, while confirming two to three meetings with Claimant in 1995, denied having said anything that could be understood as a commitment of awarding Claimant frequencies for a three-tiers network with nationwide coverage, calling Claimant\u2019s allegations in this respect \"totally false\".\n\nSee Witness Statements of Joseph Ch. Lemire, para 12 at p. 4.\n\n50.\n\nMr. Petrenko witnessed that he had explained Claimant the procedure for awarding broadcasting frequencies and licences under the then-applicable version of the LTR45. Hereunder, the National Council had first to obtain a confirmation from the State Centre that the frequencies sought by a radio company were available and, upon receipt of this confirmation, organize a tender process for those frequencies open to competitive bidding by interested radio companies. Only as a result of this process could the National Council award a broadcasting licence as a collegial decision. Neither Mr. Petrenko as Chairman nor any other member of the National Council had the legal authority to nurture expectations for broadcasting licences and, as witnessed, all that Mr. Petrenko had done was to refer Claimant to this process.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s RLA - 2 for a partial English translation of this law.\n\n51.\n\nBefore initiating tender proceedings, the National Council used to inquire with the State Committee whether the frequencies envisaged to be put for tender were available. In the frame of this procedure, the aforementioned July 18, 1995 letter from the National Council to the State Committee was nothing more than a routine inquiry as to the availability of the frequencies sought by Claimant.46\n\nSee Rebuttal Witness Statement of Viktor Petrenko, paras. 12-34.\n\n52.\n\nThe aforementioned three factual errors - (1) erroneous reading of a reference to a \"nationwide FM channel\" into the July 1995 letter; (2) erroneous extension of the (positive) October 1995 response to an AM frequency; and (3) failure to take Mr. Petrenko\u2019s witness statement supported by the text of the 1993 LTR into account - led to the Majority\u2019s conclusion regarding Claimant\u2019s expectations to reach nationwide coverage and to be able to set up a second AM network. But for the erroneous assumptions (1) and (2), the 1995 correspondence offered no support to Claimant\u2019s witness statement regarding a nationwide FM network and/or second AM network.\n\n53.\n\nIn the context of the procedure required by the 1993 LTR, the 1995 correspondence between the National State Committee (cc\u2019d but not addressed to Claimant) can furthermore not be construed as an expression of any promise or commitment to award certain frequencies to Claimant. Claimant has not even disputed that he had been informed of the requirements of the LTR, i.e., the necessity of tenders and a collegial decision of the National Council to award frequencies. He thus was aware that no individual member of the National Council had the authority of promising an award of frequencies. The statement in the National Council\u2019s letter that it was *\"considering the possibility\"* must in these conditions be read at face value, i.e., as an inquiry into the possibility of affording Claimant an opportunity to compete for such frequencies in tenders, but the statement cannot be construed as any commitment to facilitate Claimant\u2019s business plans.\n\n54.\n\nAs noted before (para. 19 supra), Claimant\u2019s initial expectations, as far as reflected in documents, were moreover focused on frequencies for the very same cities for which such frequencies were granted to Claimant in compliance with the Settlement Agreement. Respondent had thus fulfilled Claimant\u2019s documented (albeit not legitimated) expectations and plans as a matter of fact47.\n\nThe letter of July 18, 1995 lists two additional frequencies not Included in either the response letter of October 18, 1995 or paragraph 13 (b) of the Settlement Agreement. It must therefore be assumed that Claimant has no longer pursued an Interest in such frequencies.\n\n55.\n\nThe Majority furthermore opines that *\"Mr.Lemire undoubtedly had the legitimate expectation that Gala, which at that time was only a local station in Kyiv, would be allowed to expand,*  ***in parallel***  *with the growth of the private radio industry in Ukraine\"48* (emphasis added). However, the Majority states no reason for this finding. Claimant has entered the Ukrainian market in the initial phase of the privatization program of the radio sector. He had to anticipate that with the progress of this program further companies would enter the industry and that the competition for market shares would increase (i.e., precisely what has happened). An expectation to preserve his initial market share in an industry growing from infancy to maturity would have been highly unrealistic.\n\nSee para. 268 of the First Decision.\n\n56.\n\nMoreover, such an expectation has not been pleaded by Claimant. Claimant has pleaded an expectation to benefit from his \"first mover advantage\" in creating a three-tiers network with nationwide coverage; and he has focused his interest and discussions with the Ukrainian authorities from the outset on the regions specified before. He has never alleged a growth expectation \"in parallel\" with the growth of the private radio industry in Ukraine. This assumption of the Majority has no basis.\n\n**I.C. Conclusions**\n--------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Majority, with respect to violations of the FET standard, takes into consideration Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations; and it relates them to Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans as discussed with the National Council in 1995 - 1997. In my view, the Majority\u2019s analysis in point entails legal and factual errors.\n\n58.\n\nMy principal legal dissent grounds on the Majority\u2019s failure to consider the implications of the Settlement Agreement, the latter\u2019s status of and legal force as an award on agreed terms notwithstanding. The Majority overlooks that Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans and expectations, whatever they might have been and to whatever extent they might have been legitimate, have been precluded by the Settlement Agreement from consideration in the present arbitration as a matter of *res judicata.* By nevertheless taking Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans into account, the Majority in my view exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers.\n\n59.\n\nOn the facts, the Majority accepts the 1995 correspondence between the National Council and the State Centre as evidence of representations legitimating Claimant\u2019s expectations for a nationwide FM network and an additional AM network, although this correspondence makes no mention of a nationwide FM network and the State Centre\u2019s response fails to confirm the availability of an AM frequency. Moreover, the Majority relies one-sidedly on Claimant\u2019s witness statement regarding alleged assurances of then -National Council Chairman and members, but ignores the witness statement of this Chairman refuting Claimant\u2019s allegations in point, even though the refuting testimony is supported by the then- applicable law submitted.\n\n60.\n\nIn my view, Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans and expectations provide no basis for supporting his claims under the FET standard with respect to Respondent\u2019s failure of awarding additional frequencies to Gala. The National Council had no obligation to consider such plans and expectations in its decisions on Claimant\u2019s tender applications.49 Claimant could legitimately only expect that the applications be assessed and decided upon on a case-by-case basis and on an equal footing with competing applications in accordance with the criteria and guidelines set forth in the LTR50.\n\nlndeed, any consideration of such expectations by the National Council could probably have been challenged by competing tender participants as a violation of the LTR.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CLA - 3.\n\n**II. CLAIMANT\u2019S CAPACITY TO ASSERT RIGHTS OF GALA WITH RESPECT TO TENDERS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**II.A. Disregard of Gala\u2019s Corporate Personality by the Majority**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Majority assumes a violation of Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard of the BIT on account of the treatment of Gala as an (actual or frustrated)51 applicant for radio frequencies in tenders under Ukrainian law. Gala, i.e., CJSC \"Radiocompany Gala\", is a closed joint stock company with juridical personality under Ukrainian law. At the time of all but one of the tenders in question, Claimant indirectly held the majority of Gala\u2019s stock through CJSC \"Mirakom Ukraina\" (\"Mirakom\"), another closed joint stock company with legal personality under Ukrainian law. In 2006, Claimant acquired all the stock of Mirakom and, thus, indirectly of Gala.52\n\nin some instances, the Majority attaches the liability to the diversion of frequencies from tenders (para 257 Infra) or the alleged futility of Gala to participate in a tender (para 464 Infra).\n\nSee paras. 36 and 52 - 54 of the First Decision. Only the tender of February 6, 2008 (which is Immaterial to the Award) falls in the period when Claimant was the sole Indirect stockholder of Gala.\n\n62.\n\nThe licence to broadcast in Ukraine is held by Gala. The rights asserted by Claimant with respect to the (non)allocation of frequencies are derived from rights of Gala as a licenced broadcaster in Ukraine. Claimant has accordingly filed a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit.\n\n63.\n\nWithout offering an explanation, the Majority disregards Gala\u2019s and Mirakom\u2019s legal personalities, featuring Claimant as Gala\u2019s *alter ego.* in this way, the Majority *ipso iure* attributes Gala\u2019s rights under Ukrainian tender legislation to Claimant in his capacity as a United States investor in Ukraine. This approach brings Gala\u2019s treatment under the umbrella of the FET standard of the BIT and facilitates the award of damages to Claimant on account of (assumed) unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of Gala by the National Council in and with respect to tenders.\n\n64.\n\nIn my view, Gala\u2019s and Mirakom's legal personalities cannot be discarded as a foregone conclusion. Reasons would have to be offered for piercing Gala\u2019s and Mirakom\u2019s corporate veils. Possible reasons are discussed below under three headings, namely:\n\n\u25a0 International law in general and the BIT in particular recognize the legal personality of corporations with foreign investments in principle (II. B.).\n\n\u25a0 The legal personality of Gala/Mirakom cannot *ipso iure* be ignored on account of Claimant\u2019s majority/sole shareownership of Gala/Mirakom (N.C.); and\n\n\u25a0 Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit is inadmissible under Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to National Treatment under the BIT(II.D.).\n\n**II.B. International law in general and the BIT in particular Recognize the Legal Personality of Corporations with Foreign Investments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**II.B.1. Corporate Personality under International Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nMost municipal legal systems recognize corporations as legal persons distinct from their shareholders. The distinction between rights of corporations and those of their shareholders is commonplace in municipal legal systems. It pervades municipal legal systems in many areas and cannot be discarded as just a technicality53.\n\nSee Zachary Douglas,\"The *International Law of Investment Claims\",* Cambridge 2009, paras.743 -749 with reference to USA, Reparation Commission, *\"Deutsche Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft Oil Tankers\",* 2 UNRIAA, p. 777.\n\n66.\n\nIn the *Barcelona Traction* case, the ICJ articulated the question *\"whether international law recognizes for the shareholders in a company a separate and independent right or interest in respect of damage done to the company by a foreign government; and if so to what extent and in what circumstances\"54.* The ICJ determined that such a separate right is in principle recognized by international law and that its scope must be delineated in light of the pertinent principles generally accepted by municipal legal systems55. The ICJ reaffirmed this doctrine in the Case Concerning *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo56.* And in *CMS v. Argentina,* the ad hoc Committee annulled the tribunal\u2019s decision on the umbrella clause because the tribunal had assumed, without analysis, that CMS, as shareholder of TGN, could enforce Argentina\u2019s obligations towards TGN under a licence to transport gas57.\n\nICJ, *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Ltd (Belgium v. Spain),* ICJ Reports 1964, p. 44 (Preliminary Objections).\n\nSee Douglas, fn. 53, para 765 and note 20 with reference to *Barcelona Traction.*\n\nICJ, *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo(Guinea v. Congo),* ICJ Reports 2007 (II), p. 606, paras. 61 - 63 (Preliminary Objections). See Douglas, supra fn. 52, para. 771.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Application for Annulment of August 21, 2007, paras. 95 -97; Douglas, supra fn. 53, para. 769.\n\n67.\n\nThe legal personality of a corporate entity distinct from its shareholder(s) is thus in principle recognized in international law.\n\n68.\n\nFrom this recognition follows the distinction between rights accruing directly to an investor in his capacity as shareholder (\"shareholder rights\") and rights of the corporate entity the violation of which diminishes the economic value of the shareholding (\"corporate rights\")58. BIT protected investors have as a matter of principle *ius standi* for asserting the violation of their shareholder rights under the terms of the BIT concerned59. However, a BIT protected investor may assert a violation of corporate rights under a BIT only in special qualifying circumstances60.\n\nSee Douglas, supra fn. 53, para. 759 who distinguishes between \"direct Injury\" to and \"reflective loss\" of an Investor in a corporation.\n\nSee Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rule 47 and paras. 773 - 779.\n\nSee Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rule 49 and paras. 782 - 819.\n\n**II.B.2. Corporate Personality under the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe BIT does not expressly cover *\"corporate rights\".* However, it extends protection to *\"associated* activities\" which include *\"access to (...) licences, permits and other approvals* (...)\"61. The protection against arbitrary or discriminatory measures moreover includes *\"the (...) expansion (...) of investments\"62.* With reference to these provisions, the Tribunal unanimously assumes its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* for claims based on the BIT.63\n\nSee Articles 1.1(e) and 11.11(b) of the BIT.\n\nSee Article II. 3(b) of the BIT.\n\nSee para. 91 of the First Decision.\n\n70.\n\nIn my view, the question of an Investor\u2019s *ius standi* for asserting corporate rights under a BIT is a question of substantive law rather than of jurisdiction.64 The issue is not prejudged by affirming jurisdiction.65\n\nSee Douglas, supra fn. 52, paras 743, 744.\n\nThe analysis in this chapter remains relevant if the question is considered as a question of jurisdiction. In that case, the Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction if Claimant lacks *ius standi* for claims derived from Gala\u2019s treatment in the allocation of frequencies.\n\n71.\n\nThe extension of the BIT to *\"associated activities\"* and *\"expansion of investments\"* does not, as a matter of *raison d\u2019etre,* imply the admissibility of shareholder derivative suits under the BIT. Investments in direct operations in Ukraine are not affected by the issue. Where investments are made in a corporate entity under Ukrainian law and shareholder derivative suits are disallowed, the protection of *associate activities* covers investors\u2019 access to licences, permits and approvals for the acquisition of shares in the enterprise concerned, and the protection of *expansion* applies to the increase of an investor\u2019s share in the enterprise, such as the acquisition of a controlling majority.\n\n72.\n\nWithout a compelling argument, the aforementioned extensions of the BIT cannot be interpreted broadly so as implicitly extending BIT protection across the board to shareholder derivative suits. The BIT fails to provide a threshold for the admissibility of such suits. Absent such a threshold, an admission of such suits would entitle all shareholders no matter how miniscule their shareholding to assert corporate rights under the BIT. Practically every Ukrainian corporation could buy into the BIT by persuading a U.S. national to buy a share in it. Such a consequence would clearly exceed the *object and purpose* of the BIT to *\"promote greater economic cooperation between* [the State Parties to the BIT], *with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party\"66.* it cannot be read into the BIT without clear support in its language67.\n\nSee Preamble to the BIT.\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 53, paras. 747 and 748.\n\n73.\n\nIt thus follows that:\n\n\u25a0 The legal personality of Gala and Mirakom under Ukrainian law is recognized in principle by international law and the BIT in particular.\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s rights under Ukrainian tender legislation cannot *ipso iure* be attributed to Claimant.\n\n\u25a0 Such attribution would have to be justified by special reasons for piercing Gala\u2019s and Mirakom\u2019s corporate veils and admitting Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit.\n\n**II.C. Inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s Shareholder Derivative Suit under Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**II.C.1. Claimant\u2019s Majority/Sole Share Ownership Alone Does Not Justify Piercing Gala/Mirakom\u2019s Corporate Veil**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nIn fact, Claimant acts as Gala\u2019s *alter ego.* He not only is the latter\u2019s majority shareholder and, since 2006 sole (indirect) shareholder; he also is its managing director; and his personal and Gala\u2019s corporate assets are commingled68. This might explain why the Majority pays no attention to Gala\u2019s corporate personality.\n\nSee para. 301 of the Award.\n\n75.\n\nMunicipal courts tend to ease the requirements for piercing a corporation\u2019s veil in the case of closely-held majority/solely owned corporations. And the reasons for recognizing the corporate personality under international law are less persuasive with respect to such corporations69.\n\nThe main reasons are potential for multiplicity of actions, double recovery, and prejudice to creditors. See Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rule 50 and paras. 853 - 858 as well as note 242: reference to American Law Institute, *Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations 1994, para. 7.01.*\n\n76.\n\nNevertheless, no rule is established in either municipal legal systems or international law authorizing the disregard of the corporate personality of such closely-held corporations *ipso iure70.* The issue must be reasoned with a view to the particular interests involved. The Majority fails to do so71.\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rules 47 - 49 listing the case groups where shareholder suits are admissible without including sole shareownership.\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 53, p. 435 under the heading *\"INADMISSIBLE SHAREHOLDER CLAIMS FOR* *REFLECTIVE LOSS\"......(ii)\"Breach by the host state of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment....with respect* *to measures attributable to the host state taken against the company.....\".*\n\n77.\n\nNo established principle for piercing Gala\u2019s corporate veil applies to the case at hand: Claimant, with respect to the allocation of frequencies, does not assert rights attaching to his shareholding in Gala72. Neither does Claimant seek a remedy for the breach of an undertaking to him directly rather than to Gala73, nor has Gala been deprived of a remedy or the capacity to sue on its own behalf, nor has Gala suffered a denial of justice74.\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rule 47 and paras. 773 - 779 with a discussion of the ICJ decision in the *Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula SpA (,ELSI\")(USA v. Italy),* ICJ Reports 1989, p. 15 et seq..\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rule 48 and paras. 780, 781. Claimant has not pleaded, and the Majority has not determined, that his discussions with the National Council in 1995 - 1997 resulted in a legally binding undertaking of the National Council towards him on the allocation of frequencies. In any case, any rights on account of such an undertaking would be excluded from these arbitral proceedings by the Settlement Agreement as Claimant\u2019s (alleged) legitimate expectations.\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 53, Rule 49 and paras 782 - 799, 805 - 816. It is uncontested that Gala under Ukrainian law had remedies to challenge the decisions of the National Council satisfying rule of law standards. In the Majority\u2019s view, the effectiveness of these remedies is limited (see para. 281 of the First Decision). Yet, the Majority does not convert these limits Into a denial of justice.\n\n78.\n\nAs a particular feature of the present case, however, Gala\u2019s corporate veil is imposed on Claimant by Ukrainian law under Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT.\n\n**II.C.2. Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT as exercised Precludes Claimant\u2019s Shareholder Derivative Suit**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAs per section 3 of the Annex to the BIT, *\"Ukraine reserves the right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment (...) in the sectors or matters it has indicated below: (...) ownership and operation of (...) radio broadcasting stations\".* Respondent has exercised this reserved right by prohibiting the *\"Foundation of TV/radio organizations (...) for (...) foreign legal entities and physical persons\"* as well as the *\"Licensing of foreign TV/radio organizations\"75.* Article 25 (6) and (7) of the LTR moreover limits participation in tenders for frequencies to legal entities licensed to broadcast in Ukraine.\n\nSee Articles 12(2) and 23(2) of the LTR.\n\n80.\n\nBy dint of these restrictions, a foreign investor cannot receive a licence for radio broadcasting in Ukraine. He can participate in the Ukrainian radio industry **only** in his capacity as a shareholder of an existing Ukrainian corporate entity but not in his own right. in particular, he cannot in his own right participate in tenders for frequencies. All rights conferred by Ukrainian legislation to radio broadcasters with respect to the participation and treatment in such tenders are exclusively reserved to Ukrainian corporate entities licensed to broadcast. They cannot evolve to a foreign investor in such a company, no matter how significant his share in and control of the company may be. Recognition of the legal personality of the Ukrainian corporation licensed to broadcast is *conditio sine qua non* for the participation of a foreign investor in the Ukrainian radio industry. This system forestalls piercing the corporate veil of a licensed radio company for purposes of sector legislation, including tender regulations to the benefit of a foreign investor in such a company.\n\n81.\n\nThese restrictions were already enshrined in the initial 1993 version of the LTR and are still included in its present version. They thus apply to all tenders and tender situations providing the basis for the claims related to the allocation of frequencies.\n\n82.\n\nIf covered by Ukraine\u2019s Reservation, the aforementioned restrictions limit the scope of BIT protection and thus the powers of the Tribunal. The crucial question is thus whether the restrictions represent *\"limited exceptions to national treatment\"* with respect to the *\"ownership and operation of (...) radio broadcasting stations\".*\n\n83.\n\nThe restrictions leave untouched a U.S. Investor\u2019s rights attaching directly to his shareholding in a radio company. However, they exclude \"corporate rights\" conferred by Ukrainian sector legislation on a licenced radio company as a basis of a foreign shareholder\u2019s derivative suit.\n\n84.\n\nThe restrictions aim at safeguarding the integrity of Ukraine\u2019s regulatory regime of the radio industry. Under this regime, frequencies and, thus, market shares are allocated through competitive tenders open to licensed radio broadcasters in Ukraine only76. The tender process is the cornerstone of the sector regime. Ensuring the effectiveness and fairness of this process is a prime concern of sector legislation.\n\nSee Articles 23(6) and 25 of the LTR.\n\n85.\n\nFair competition of all participants in a level playing field is pivotal to the tender process. Special privileges accorded to some participants but not available to others tend to translate into \"reverse\" discrimination of underprivileged contenders and undermine both fair competition and the effective selection of the best.\n\n86.\n\nBIT protection with respect to tenders may privilege some tender participants over their domestic contenders and foreign contenders without BIT protection. It thus tends to undermine the fairness and effectiveness of the process77.\n\nThis aspect is further developed in paras. 117-120 infra.\n\n87.\n\nTo protect the integrity of the tender process, Ukraine, with the Reservation and its exercise, aims at excluding the extension of BIT protection to tenders. This approach ensures that all tender participants, whether domestic or foreign and whether from a country of origin with or without BIT, are all governed by the same rules set forth in applicable Ukrainian legislation to the exclusion of any superseding international law protection.\n\n88.\n\nSafeguarding an essential and legitimate regulatory interest, i.e., the integrity of the tender process, the aforementioned restrictions are covered by Ukraine\u2019s Reservation.\n\n89.\n\nHence, the claims derived from Gala\u2019s participation or frustrated participation in tenders for frequencies are inadmissible in this arbitration. They had to be dismissed a *limine.*\n\n**II.D. Claimant\u2019s Derivative Suit Denotes Inconsistent Behaviour**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe above conclusion is reinforced by the maxim of *non licet venire contra factum proprium* or behaviour contrary to Article 1.8 of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles.\n\n91.\n\nClaimant deliberately used the shell of Ukrainian corporations (Gala and Mirakom) to invest in the Ukrainian radio sector despite the aforementioned restrictions under the LTR. Towards this end, he initially established Gala and had Gala succeed to the rights of Provisen, a Ukrainian company that held the crucial licence for Kiev78. He further insisted on his status as a shareholder of Gala/Mirakom (rather than a radio operator in his own right) in applying for the renewal of Gala\u2019s licence due on September 18, 2008. And he staged a harassment claim for moral damages on the ground that the National Council had raised the question whether the prohibitions for foreigners under the LTR might impede renewal of Gala\u2019s licence, although he was just a shareholder of Gala/Mirakom79. The licence was renewed until 2015 on account of Gala/Mirakom\u2019s corporate personality, irrespective of Claimant\u2019s foreign citizenship.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 205.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 203 - 205; Reply Memorial, paras. 225 - 231; Post Hearing Memorial, paras. 140 -143.\n\n92.\n\nBy investing in Gala/Mirakom, seeking and obtaining in 2008 the extension of Gala\u2019s licence on account of the latter\u2019s corporate personality and filing an harassment suit on the notion that he could not legitimately be considered as anything but a shareholder of Gala/Mirakom, Claimant has relied on Gala/Mirakom\u2019s corporate personalities and accepted the principle of Ukrainian law that all rights under industry regulations attach solely to Gala\u2019s status as a Ukrainian corporation without regard to Claimant\u2019s U.S. citizenship. This applies especially to Gala\u2019s rights with respect to tenders.\n\n93.\n\nAgainst this conduct, Claimant cannot now bring a claim under the BIT derived from an (alleged) violation of Gala\u2019s rights with respect to tenders. In other words, Claimant cannot on the one hand hide behind Gala\u2019s corporate personality for purposes of Ukrainian sector legislation but on the other hand portray himself as Gala\u2019s *alter ego* for the purpose of disregarding Gala\u2019s corporate personality and thus invoking BIT protection for rights reserved to Gala under Ukrainian sector legislation. This approach denotes a *venire contra factum proprium* or inconsistent behaviour contrary to Article 1.8 of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles.\n\n**II.E. The Majority Exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s Powers by Admitting Claimant\u2019s Shareholder Derivative Suit**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Majority notes Respondent\u2019s Reservation to national treatment under the BIT as well as the prohibition under Article 12(2) of the LTR. And the Majority affirms that the prohibition is covered by the Reservation80. However, the Majority fails to apply either the Reservation and or the prohibition to the case at hand81.\n\nSee para. 267 of the First Decision.\n\nSee para. 242 of the First Decision: The reservation *\"does not affect the principles which are being pleaded by Claimant in this procedure\".*\n\n95.\n\nThe Majority explains its position as follows: *\"Under this exception* [i.e., the Reservation], *Ukraine could e.g., validly require that the founders of broadcasting companies be Ukrainian nationals. But Mr. Lemire could equally expect that once he had been awarded the necessary administrative authorization to invest in the Ukrainian radio sector, there would be a level playing field, and the administrative measures would not be inequitable, unfair, arbitrary or discriminatory\"82.*\n\nSee para. 267 of the First Decision.\n\n96.\n\nThe Majority thus limits the Reservation to the initial authorization of Claimant\u2019s investments in the Ukrainian radio industry. This reading is inconsistent with the plain language of the Reservation. The latter encompasses the *\"ownership*  ***and operation***  *of* *radio broadcasting stations\"* (emphasis provided) and thus clearly extends to postestablishment treatment of radio stations, including tender applications for additional frequencies.\n\n97.\n\nBy the same token, the Majority considers only the prohibition for foreign investors of founding radio organizations. It discards this prohibition as a formality in the establishment of a radio company; and it ignores the further restrictions under the LTR outlined in paras. 79 to 81 supra.\n\n98.\n\nUnlike stated by the Majority, Claimanthad **not** *\"been awarded the necessary administrative authorization to invest in the Ukrainian radio industry\"* to the effect of operating in this industry in his own right. He has just obtained an *investment certificate* for investing in Mirakom, a Ukrainian corporation as Gala. Such certificate applies to all foreign investments in Ukrainian companies; it is not specific to the radio industry. Mirakom had in turn invested in Gala. And only Gala has received a broadcaster\u2019s licence in its capacity as a Ukrainian corporation. The licence was awarded to Gala irrespective of the foreign nationality of Gala\u2019s indirect majority shareholder.\n\n99.\n\nThus, Claimant owes his (indirect) involvement in the Ukrainian radio industry to Gala\u2019s corporate personality strictly recognized by the National Council in awarding and renewing Gala\u2019s broadcaster\u2019s licence. Claimant has launched his investment through Mirakom. In this way, he benefitted from the practice of the National Council to note only direct owners of radio broadcasters and ignore \"ownership chains\" - a practice labelled by the Majority as a *\"shortcoming of the system\"83.*\n\nSee paras. 313, 314 of the First Decision.\n\n100.\n\nThe Majority further opines that Claimant could expect \"a level playing field\". In the same context, the Majority opines that *\"Claimant could expect a regulatory system for the broadcasting industry which was to be consistent, transparent, fair, reasonable, and enforced without arbitrary or discriminatory decisions\".*\n\n101.\n\nThis position brings the regulatory system under the umbrella of the FET standard of the BIT elevating shortcomings and misapplications of the domestic regulatory system to violations of the BIT. It ignores that *\"a level playing field\"* requires equal conditions for all contenders, domestic and foreign alike, and, therefore, conflicts with special BIT protection of Claimant. As noted before, safeguarding the \"level playing field\" in tenders for frequencies is the obvious purpose of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT in conjunction with the restrictions for foreign investors under the LTR84.\n\nSee paras. 84 - 88 supra.\n\n102.\n\nTo ensure a level playing field for all tender participants, only Ukrainian corporate entities can be licensed as broadcasters and participate in tenders. In this way, Ukrainian tender legislation is equally applied to all applicants for frequencies. Special protection of foreign investors under international law is excluded. This rationale precludes shareholder derivative suits of foreign investors in radio companies with respect to tenders. By admitting Claimant\u2019s derivative suit, the Majority defeats the very purpose of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation as exercised.\n\n103.\n\nThe Reservation limits the scope of the BIT and, thus, the powers of the Tribunal. By failing to apply the Reservation to the case at hand, the Majority hence exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers.\n\n104.\n\nThis conclusion still stands if the admissibility of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit is considered as an issue of jurisdiction *ratione materiae85.* in this case, the Tribunal, myself included, has exceeded its jurisdiction.\n\nSee paras. 69, 70 supra.\n\n105.\n\nThe inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit inevitably leads to dismissal a *limine* of all claims on account of Gala\u2019s treatment in its quest for additional frequencies86. The Majority\u2019s legal analysis of issues related to these claims87accordingly becomes obsolete. The subsequent discussion of the Majority\u2019s position disregards the inadmissibility of the pertinent claims *arguendo.*\n\nSee paras. 318 - 422 of the First Decision.\n\nSee paras. 209 - 317 of the First Decision.\n\n**III. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT IN COMPETITIVE TENDERS**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**III.A. The Majority\u2019s Approach**\n----------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Majority pays no attention to the particular dynamics of competitive tenders. Rather, it delineates the scope of the FET standard in general terms in light of the pertinent jurisprudence and literature88. In five steps, it broadens the FET standard into an overarching umbrella concept encompassing Respondent\u2019s regulatory regime for the radio industry; and it positions the Tribunal as a court of appeals adjudicating the alleged misuse of administrative discretion by the National Council.\n\nSee paras. 243 - 285 of the First Decision.\n\n*Step 1*\n--------\n\n107.\n\nAt the outset, the Majority distinguishes the FET standard under the BIT from the international law minimum standard, considering the latter as a floor rather than a ceiling. The Majority concludes *\"that actions or omissions of the Parties may qualify as unfair or inequitable, even if they do not amount to an outrage, to wilful neglect of duty, egregious insufficiency of State actions, or even in subjective bad faith\"89.*\n\nSee paras. 247 - 254 of the First Decision.\n\n*Step 2*\n--------\n\n108.\n\nSecond, the Majority interprets the *\"ordinary meaning\" of* the FET standard90. For this purpose, it amalgamates subsections (a) (FET proper) and (b) (Arbitrary or Discriminatory Measures) of Article 11.3 of the BIT into one provision. It considers the prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory measures as *\"an example of possible violations of the FET standard\"* so that subsection (b) is *ipso iure* included in subsection (a) and the latter opens the door to broadening protection.\n\nSee paras. 258 - 263 of the First Decision.\n\n*Step 3*\n--------\n\n109.\n\nNext, the Majority links the FET standard to Claimant\u2019s - assumed - legitimate expectations91. According to the Majority, Claimant could expect:\n\n\u25a0 \"a *regulatory system for the broadcasting industry which was to be consistent,* *transparent, fair, reasonable, and enforced without arbitrary or discriminatory decisions\"92',* and\n\n\u25a0 To *\"be allowed to expand, in parallel with the growth of the private radio industry in* *Ukraine\"93.*\n\nSee paras. 265 - 271 of the First Decision.\n\nSee para. 267 of the First Decision.\n\nSee para. 268 of the First Decision.\n\n*Step 4*\n--------\n\n110.\n\nFurther, the Majority associates the FET standard with *\"the main purpose of the BIT\"* as stated in the latter\u2019s Preamble, i.e., *\"the stimulation of foreign investment....\"94.* it thus implies that the standard be delineated in light of this overriding investor-friendly objective.\n\nSee paras. 272 - 273 of the First Decision.\n\n*Step 5*\n--------\n\n111.\n\nFinally, the Majority discards Claimant\u2019s failure of having sought local remedies and puts the Tribunal in the position of a court of appeals against tender decisions of the National Council95. Although expressing respect of the National Council\u2019s cognitive discretion, the Majority considers any *\"arbitrary or capricious\"* action as a violation of the BIT. In its view, *\"favouritism\"* and exercise of *\"undue influence over the decision-making of regulatory bodies\"* all constitute treaty violations96.\n\nSee paras. 274 - 283 of the First Decision.\n\nSee para. 283 of the First Decision.\n\n112.\n\nNoteworthy is what the Majority does not require - namely that the challenged action specifically relate to a BIT protected investor. It apparently applies the BIT to any flaw in the system or major irregularity in its implementation as long as a BIT protected investor is somehow affected.\n\n113.\n\nMy criticism of the Majority\u2019s position chiefly concentrates on two aspects peculiar to the present case but not addressed by the Majority, namely:\n\n\u25a0 The operation of the FET standard in competitive tenders (III.B.); and\n\n\u25a0 The impact of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to National Treatment on the FET standard (III.C.).\n\nAs shown in chapter II. supra, these two aspects preclude Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit. If such suit is erroneously admitted, the same aspects militate against a broad delineation of the FET standard.\n\n114.\n\nIn addition, I will comment on the relevance of post-BIT interpretations on the FET standard under the BIT (III.D.).\n\n**III.B. The FET Standard in Competitive Tenders**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nAccording to the LTR, frequencies are awarded by the National Council on the basis of tenders. These are publicly announced and in principle open to all radio broadcasters licenced in Ukraine. This system aims at selecting the best contenders in terms of criteria set forth in the LTR97 and special conditions determined by the National Council for each tender.\n\nSee Article 25(14) of the LTR and paras. 28, 29 supra.\n\n116.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert witness Wiegand describes the main determinants of success in these proceedings as follows:\n\n\"If you are applying for a radio frequency, you usually have to prove mainly two things: first that the format that you are presenting or want to do adds to the diversity of the market; and second, that you have the professional abilities to run a radio station\"98.\n\nIn other words, the tender proceedings are open competitions for market shares on the basis of the quality of the tender application and the demonstrated ability to perform. In addition to their performance in the process, broadcasters\u2019 financial and technical resources in participating in as many tenders as possible are decisive for broadcasters\u2019 market share.\n\nSee Hearing Transcript of July 12, 2010, para. 183 at p. 142.\n\n**III.B.1. Equal treatment of all contenders is pivotal to the fairness and effectiveness of the tender process**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nFair competition is crucial for such a system to function properly. All market participants must have equal access to the tenders and compete in the process on the same terms and conditions, in a \"level playing field\". According equal treatment to all broadcasters in the Ukrainian market is essential to both the inherent fairness and the effectiveness of the system. Special privileges, priorities or preferences afforded to some broadcasters undermine the system. This begs the question whether BIT protection accorded only to foreign investors from certain countries is compatible with the inherent dynamics of a tender system or whether it implies \"reverse discrimination\" of all broadcasters in the market without the benefit of a BIT to the detriment of the effectiveness of the process.\n\n118.\n\nBIT protection is at variance with the systemic requirements of the tender process if it affords BIT protected investors competitive advantages over their contenders. As noted before, the success in winning market shares through tenders depends on the quality and frequency of tender applications. This in turn largely depends on the resources which can be invested in tender applications on a sound business basis.\n\n119.\n\nTender applications are investments in business opportunities. Typically, only one of several contenders can win the award. Prospects of recovering the costs of unsuccessful applications in case of irregularities reduce the risks attendant to tender applications; and prospects of recovering the profits foregone due to tenders lost (as awarded by the Majority) increase the opportunities. In financial terms, rights of recovering foregone profits increase the number of potential winners in tenders - the actual winner in the tender and legal winners in subsequent litigation. Superior prospects of claims to recover the costs of tender applications or even recoup foregone profits thus enhance the risk/return ratio of tender applications. They place the beneficiary of such prospects in a privileged position over contenders without such prospects. Hence, they imply \"reverse discrimination\" of contenders without such prospects of recovery; and they distort competition.\n\n120.\n\nBIT protection is available only to investors from countries of origin that have concluded a BIT with the host country concerned. Where these investors compete in tender proceedings with domestic investors and foreign investors without BIT protection, they inadvertently enjoy a privileged position over their contenders. BIT protection tends to lead to unequal treatment of tender participants and thus undermine the integrity of the tender process.\n\n**III.B.2. The BIT Affords Higher Protection in Tenders than Ukrainian Law and Municipal Laws in General**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nBITs typically strengthen investment protection beyond the protection afforded under the host country\u2019s municipal law with a view to overcoming foreign investors\u2019 concerns about the impartiality of domestic courts and the compliance of municipal laws with widely accepted legal standards. Some competitive advantages of BIT protected investors over domestic business operators are implicit in the BIT system. They cannot, as a matter of principle, be grounds for denying BIT protection.\n\n122.\n\nTenders present a special situation, though. Here, undistorted competition is fundamental to the process. Municipal laws shape the rights of tender participants with a view to the particular features of tenders. BITs and the international law principles on the *\"Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\"99* complementing BITs do not take the special dynamics of tenders into account. Due to their generality, the aforementioned principles tend to provide broader substantive protection to tender participants than Ukrainian law in consonance with the typical practice of municipal laws.\n\nSee International Law Commission, *\"Draft articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries\",* ILC Yearbook 2001, Vol. II, Part Two (hereinafter referred to as \"ILC Articles\"). Pp. 26 et seq.\n\n123.\n\nThus, appeals against adverse tender decisions of the National Council are subject to a one-month-deadline100. The BIT, on the other hand, does not provide any deadline for actions under its protections; and the BIT itself has been concluded for an initial ten years and even perpetuity if not terminated101. While domestic tender participants must thus appeal National Council decisions individually and promptly, BIT protected investors may accumulate claims under BITs and file them summarily at any time of their convenience. Precisely this has happened in the present case. The Interregnum providing the basis of the Award ended in June 2000102 while Claimant\u2019s request for arbitration dates from September 6, 2006.\n\nSee article 30 (4) of the LTR ; Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CLA -3.\n\nSee article XII of the BIT.\n\nSee para. 180 Infra\n\n124.\n\nAs the Majority correctly observes103, moreover, appeals against tender decisions provide limited redress. If an appellant succeeds, the court can only set aside the decision concerned and the National Council may be obliged to repeat the tender. However, the National Council is normally still at liberty to award the frequency to another contender rather than to the successful appellant. The appellant might thus have invested time and money in two tender proceedings plus (successful) court proceedings and still end up empty-handed104.\n\nSee para. 281 of the First Decision.\n\nCf. para. 281 of the First Decision.\n\n125.\n\nThe aforementioned disadvantages of local remedies in comparison with BIT protection do not reflect any departure of Ukrainian law from recognized principles of law within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute. Appeals against administrative decisions are in the interest of legal certainty usually subject to deadlines so that - unlike under BITs -grievances under municipal administrative law systems can normally not be accumulated over years and then be summarily submitted to court105. And the aforementioned perils for appellants of tender decisions follow from the special nature of such decisions affecting several tender participants alike. Accordingly, the Majority has not found these limits at variance with recognized principles of law.\n\nFor instance, under para. 74 of the German Law on Administrative Court Procedures (\"Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung\"), *\"administrative acts\"* must, as a rule, be appealed within one month of notification. This deadline coincides with the aforementioned one-month deadline under para. 30(4) of the LTR. The deadline precludes the possibility of accumulating grievances overtime and bundle them Into summary suits that may be filed at any time convenient.\n\n126.\n\nMoreover, municipal laws typically limit recovery rights of applicants losing out in flawed tenders to the costs incurred in connection with the bid *(damnum emergens).* Lost profits *(lucrum cessans)* can be recovered in exceptional circumstances only106.\n\nThis Issue is further developed in paras. 274 - 283 infra with references to European and German law.\n\n127.\n\nBIT protection thus significantly expands the substantive rights of tender participants beyond the protection accorded in like situations under Ukrainian law in particular or municipal laws in general. Extending the FET standard of the BIT to Gala\u2019s treatment with respect to tenders thus places Gala in a privileged position over its contenders without BIT protection - to the detriment of the integrity of the tender system. The broader the FET standard is delineated, the more the tender system becomes undermined.\n\n128.\n\nThis aspect in my view calls for a restrictive application of the FET standard to tenders. The standard cannot be interpreted as an \"umbrella clause\" *ipso iure* elevating violations of tender rules to international delicts. And Ukraine\u2019s Reservation restraining BIT protection with respect to the broadcasting sector assumes particular attention in case of tenders107.\n\nThe complexities in applying BIT protection to tender proceedings moreover reinforce the arguments against admitting Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit (see ch. II supra).\n\n**III.C. The FET Standard in light of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to National Treatment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**III.C. 1. The Reservation Indirectly Limits the Scope of the FET Standard**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nAs noted before, Ukraine, in para. 3 of the Annex to the BIT, has reserved its *\"right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment\" in special sectors, including \"ownership and operation of television and radio broadcasting stations\".* The Majority discards the Reservation as irrelevant to the case at hand108.\n\nSee paras. 79 - 88 supra.\n\n130.\n\nThe Reservation relates literally only to national treatment under article 11.1 of the BIT while the Majority applies the FET standard under article II.3. However, the FET standard must be interpreted in light of its *object and purpose* as well as the *context* of the overall BIT, including the annex thereto109.\n\nArticle 31(1) and (2) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n131.\n\nIn substance, the scope of national treatment overlaps with the FET standard. In particular, a violation of national treatment almost by definition also constitutes a *\"discriminatory measure\"* within the meaning of Article II 3 (b) of the BIT. The Majority defines *\"discriminatory measure\"* as a measure that either is *\"discriminatory and expose[s] the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice\"* or *\"target[s] Claimant\u2019s investments specifically as foreign investments\"110.* This test corresponds to the interpretation of FET in the *Saluka* case as a standard which requires that *\"any differential treatment of a foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must be justified by showing* *that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investments over the foreign owned investment\"111.*\n\nSee para. 261 of the First Decision with references.\n\nSaluka *v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award of March 17, 2006, para. 307. See loana Tudor, supra fn. 34, pp. 186 -189 on the relationship between FET and National Treatment.\n\n132.\n\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s definition of *\"discriminatory measure\".* it Implies, though, that the FET standard must be interpreted with a view to avoiding a conflict with the Reservation. The latter\u2019s purpose would be defeated if the exercise of the Reservation would be considered as legitimate under national treatment but nevertheless as breaching the FET standard.\n\n**III.C.2. The Reservation Countervails the Emphasis on Fair and Equitable Treatment in the Preamble of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Majority advocates interpreting the FET standard in the context of the Preamble of the BIT stating *\"that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment...\"112.* While correct in principle, this argument is less persuasive with respect to Ukraine\u2019s radio industry covered by the Reservation.\n\nPara. 264 of the First Decision.\n\n134.\n\nThe Reservation communicates that Ukraine attaches priority to its sovereign regulation of the radio industry over the *\"fair and equitable treatment\"* of foreign Investors in that Industry. This choice of priority is strengthened by the broad terms of the Reservation. It authorizes the introduction of new exceptions after conclusion of the BIT113; and it encompasses the admission as well as the subsequent treatment of foreign investments.\n\nSee Annex to the BIT: ***\"make***  *or maintain.,.exceptions...\"*\n\n135.\n\nThus, the Reservation operated as analert to Claimant. He had to take serious regulations in existence when he made his investment which limited foreign Investors\u2019 rights in the radio industry. And he even had to anticipate future policy measures adversely affecting him as a foreign investor in that industry114.\n\nThe latter risk is alleviated (but not eliminated) by article 11.1(3) of the BIT providing that future exceptions to national treatment will not apply to Investments pre-existing the effectiveness of the exception.\n\n136.\n\nCautioning foreign investors about the reliability of equal treatment with domestic investors, the Reservation compromises the principal purpose of the BIT as reflected in its Preamble, namely *\"to stimulate the flow of private capital....\"115.* The BIT Parties have deliberately accepted to weaken the incentive value of the BIT in order to preserve their sovereign control over specified sensitive or strategic sectors, including radio broadcasting. Beyond its direct impact on national treatment, the Reservation reflects the consensus of the BIT parties that, with respect to the specified sectors, the preservation of uncompromised sovereignty prevail over the principal purpose of the BIT. The Reservation must thus be taken into account in the analysis of \"object and purpose\" of the BIT116 as a factor countervailing the statements of the Preamble.\n\nSee Preamble to the BIT and para. 272 of the First Decision.\n\nSee paras. 272, 273 of the First Decision.\n\n137.\n\nWhile the  Reservation authorizes less favourable treatment of BIT investors than of domestically-owned radio operators, the issue at hand is whether the FET standard entitles Claimant to preferential treatment over domestic competitors. In this respect, the Reservation implies a *fortiori* a bias of the BIT Parties against preferential treatment of foreign investors in the radio industry where such treatment conflicts with industry-specific public policy interests. The proper functioning of the tender process is essential to developing this sector with a view to Ukraine\u2019s overarching media policy objectives. This militates against according preferential protection to a BIT investor at variance with the dynamics of this process.\n\n138.\n\nAs noted before, Ukraine, in the exercise of its reserved sovereign freedom of regulating the radio industry, has prohibited the foundation and operation of radio stations by foreigners117 Claimant is permitted to operate in the Ukrainian radio industry only through Gala which he owns indirectly through CJSC \"Mirakom Ukraine\" which like Gala is incorporated in Ukraine118. According Gala in competitive tenders for market shares preferential treatment on account of its (indirect) foreign ownership would diametrically run counter Ukraine\u2019s pertinent industry policy, as reflected in its relevant legislation and sanctioned by its Reservation to the BIT.\n\nSee paras. 79 - 81 supra.\n\nSee para. 36 of the First Decision.\n\n**III.D. The FET Standard in light of Post-BIT Interpretations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Majority analyses the relationship of the FET standard in the BIT with the minimum standard of treatment of aliens established under customary International law. It notes that the FET standard has been assimilated with the minimum standard by a July 31, 2001 Interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission of Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA119 as well as the 2004 US Model BIT120. In the Majority\u2019s opinion, *\"this principle of assimilation between customary minimum standard and FETstandard \"* does not apply to the US -Ukraine BIT of 1996121.\n\nThe *concept of 'fair and equitable treatment\u2019,...do[es] not require treatment in addition to or beyond that, which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\"*\n\nArtlcle 5(1) of the Model BIT provides that *\"Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment...\"..*  \n See paras. 247 -251 of the First Decision with references.\n\nSee paras. 252 - 255 of the First Decision.\n\n140.\n\nWhile I agree that the aforementioned positions do not retroactively apply to the BIT predating them, I disagree with the Implication that they are of no relevance for interpreting the BIT. These positions were adopted in response to a trend of tribunals towards gradually expanding the scope of the FET standard as a non-contingent standard potentially according foreign investors preferential treatment over domestic investors in like cases. This trend started in 1997 with the *AMT case122* and has since 2000 culminated in a proliferation of International investment claims on the basis of the FET standard123.\n\n*American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v. Democratic Republic of Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, Award of February 21, 1997.\n\nSee esp. the three pre Interpretive Note findings based on FET that supposedly have led to the NAFTA States' decision to Introduce the Interpretive Note: *Metalclad v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award of August 25, 2000; *S.D. Myers v. Mexico,* Ad hoc Arbitration, First Partial Award of November 13, 2000 and *Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* Ad hoc Arbitration, Award on the Merits of April 10, 2001. See also loana Tudor, supra note 33, pp. 3,4 with references.\n\n141.\n\nThe BIT had been signed on March 4, 1994 and negotiated on the basis of the 1992 and 1994 US Model BITs. The activation of the FET standard as an operative cause of action and the ensuing expansion of its scope by tribunals beyond the International law minimum standard could hardly have been foreseen by the BIT Parties when they negotiated and concluded the BIT. Even less could they anticipate the application of this standard to tender proceedings in a reserved industry where foreign investors compete with domestic contenders for market shares.\n\n142.\n\nWhere an open-ended general clause as the FET standard meets with a situation clearly out of sight to the Parties to an agreement when it was concluded, the pertinent intent of the Parties needs to be hypothesised. Would the Parties have extended the standard to the situation at hand if they had anticipated it? Positions assumed by the Parties in the aftermath of the agreement can indicate their hypothetical intent at the conclusion of the agreement124.\n\nCf. Articles 4.1(2) and 4.3\u00a9 of the UNIDROIT Principles according to which in cases where the common Intention of the parties cannot be established, *\"the contract shall be interpreted according to the meaning that reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances\"'* and *\"regard shall be had to.....the conduct of the parties subsequent to the conclusion of the contract\".*\n\n143.\n\nThe 2004 US Model BIT shows the reaction of the United States to the post-BIT expansion of the FET standard - explicit assimilation of the standard to the scope of the international law minimum standard. A similar response had already before (in 2001) been given by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission to the first wave of claims based on the FET standard. The United States is the most prominent Member State of NAFTA so that the Commission\u2019s position was at least indicative of the US position at that time. The hypothetical position of the United States at the conclusion of the BIT (1996) must be inferred from its actual position assumed when it became aware of the issue and reconfirmed subsequently. It further goes without saying that Ukraine would have shared the US position in point once aware of the issue. As the capital-importing Party to the BIT it was especially interested in containing its potential liability under international law. As *\"reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties\"* (Article 4.1(2) of the UNIDROIT Principles), the common intention of the Parties to the BIT - United States and Ukraine -must therefore be interpreted to the effect that they would have assimilated the FET standard with the international law minimum standard if they had anticipated the proliferation of claims under FET.\n\n144.\n\nNevertheless, I refer to post-BIT positions of the BIT Parties only as a subsidiary argument; and I do not suggest that such positions could limit the FET standard retroactively at variance with its statement in the BIT. Such a suggestion could indeed undermine the fundamental purpose of the BIT, i.e., enhancing investor confidence in the stability of investment conditions.\n\n145.\n\nYet, the present case for the first time (as far as researched) involves the application of the FET standard to competitive tenders. And it concerns a regulated sector where the BIT Parties have restricted BIT protection to reserve the exercise of sovereign powers. In this situation, the Majority\u2019s determination sets a precedent. It further expands the application of the FET standard to a scenario not contemplated before. This expansion counteracts the (hypothetical) intention of the Parties to the BIT.\n\n**III.E. Conclusions**\n----------------------\n\n146.\n\nAs shown, the present case features five peculiarities confining the scope of the FET standard. These are:\n\n\u25a0 The alleged violations of the FET standard concern the treatment of Gala, a company incorporated and operating exclusively in Ukraine and owned by Claimant indirectly through another Ukrainian company.\n\n\u25a0 Ukrainian law restricts the participation of foreign investors in the radio industry to the acquisition of shares in an existing Ukrainian radio company so that foreign investors cannot operate in this sector in their own right.\n\n\u25a0 The above restriction is covered by the Reservation of Ukraine to National Treatment limiting BIT protection with respect to the radio sector.\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s pertinent treatment pertains to tenders where\n\no Gala competes with domestically-owned radio operators for market shares via frequencies,\n\no special BIT protection would afford Gala a competitive advantage over its contenders to the detriment of the fairness and effectiveness of the tender process, and\n\no BIT commensurable protection would expose Ukraine to unpredictable state liability excluded by tender-related legislation of developed countries.\n\n\u25a0 In response to the proliferation of claims under the FET standard since 1997, i.e., after conclusion of the BIT, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission and subsequently the United States have assimilated the FET standard with the customary international law minimum standard, thus Indicating a similar position if the Implications of the FET standard had been anticipated when the BIT was negotiated.\n\n147.\n\nIn light of these special features of the case at hand, the FET standard can in my view not be construed as an \"umbrella clause\" elevating violations of Ukrainian tender legislation *ipso iure* to a violation of the FET standard. To breach the FET standard in such circumstances, an action or inaction would have to affect specific rights of Claimant protected by the BIT beyond his interest in the economic value of his shareholding in Gala125.\n\nThe principal difficulty of the \"umbrella\" approach flows from the partial application of municipal law. The violation of municipal law is upgraded to a breach of international law. However, the procedural requirements and limitations of recovery rights tailored to the violation under municipal law are superseded by general principles of international law. Thus, the balance struck by municipal law between private interests and conflicting public interests is shifted under international law to the benefit of foreign investors. This accords competitive privileges of foreign-owned business operators over domestically-owned contenders. It might be considered in such cases to extend the application of municipal law under article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to procedural requirements and recovery limitations under municipal law specific to the violation concerned, as long as the requirements and limitations do not themselves violate international law.\n\n148.\n\nAffirming a violation of the FET standard in the present case, would therefore require a finding that either\n\n\u25a0 Claimant, by an action or inaction of Respondent, has been directly affected in his own rights as a foreign investor in Gala; or\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s treatment is linked to Claimant in his capacity as a foreign investor and not covered by Respondent\u2019s Reservation to the BIT; or\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s treatment is captured by an established case group of the FET Standard, notably denial of justice; or\n\n\u25a0 The action or inaction affecting Gala is that egregious that it amounts to a breach of the minimum standard of customary International law.\n\n149.\n\nThe suggested delimitation of the FET standard corresponds to the arguments advanced in chapter II D. against the admission of Claimant\u2019s derivative suit on account of Gala. This is no coincidence. Both the Inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s derivative suit and the delimitation of the FET standard are rooted in the same crucial facts and legal restrictions summarized in para. 146 above.\n\n**IV. PROCEDURE FOR AWARDING FREQUENCIES**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**IV.A. The Majority Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIn paras. 287-317 of the First Decision, the Majority reviews the compliance of the procedure for awarding frequencies with the FET standard. This procedure is enshrined in two laws, the LTR setting out the regulatory regime for the radio (and TV) sector and the LNC establishing the National Council.\n\n151.\n\nThe Majority observes that *\"the procedure presents some shortcomings which in essence affect:*\n\n*\u25a0 The independence of the members of the National Council;*\n\n*\u25a0 The existence of an interregnum, during which licences were awarded without tender* *procedure;*\n\n*\u25a0 The absence of a formal valuation of the applications for licences against clearly* *established criteria;*\n\n*\u25a0 The absence of reasoning for National Council decisions, whether collectively or for* *individual votes; and*\n\n*\u25a0 The lack of transparency of ultimate owners of radio companies\".126*\n\nPara. 315 of the First Decision.\n\n152.\n\nThe Majority further notes that:\n\n*\"Ukraine gained its independence only in 1991 and still is in the process of developing its institutional framework. During this formative period, legal imperfections are to be expected. Ukrainian law has improved, and after the 2006 amendments of the LTR, a significant number of weaknesses have been ameliorated\"127.*\n\nPara. 317 of the First Decision.\n\n**IV.B. My View**\n-----------------\n\n**IV.B.1. Imperfections of Ukrainian Sector Legislation Fall Short of a Violation of the FET Standard**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s observations, with reservations128. I also concur that the observed imperfections imply weaker than desired safeguards of \"clean\" tender decisions, although the Majority\u2019s finding that *\"the procedure for allocating frequencies by the National Council is fraught with shortcomings that facilitate arbitrary decision making\"129* in my view overstates the case.\n\nThe \"Interregnum\" concerned an administrative practice assumed to depart from applicable law; it does not belong into the context of procedural shortcomings provided by law. The independence of National Council members was strengthened in 2006.\n\nSee para. 316 of the First Decision.\n\n154.\n\nI wish to emphasize, however, what the Majority does **not** conclude, namely that the imperfections were that grave that they stigmatize the entire process as arbitrary or, in the words of the Annulment Committee in the *Helnan Case \"that the failure is one which displays insufficiency in the system, justifying international intervention\"130.*\n\nSee *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision on the Applicaton for Annulment of June 14, 2010, para. 48.\n\n155.\n\nNeither does the Majority find that any of the imperfections is specifically tailored on Claimant. In fact, all these imperfections are enshrined in legislation; and they affect Gala (and thus indirectly Claimant) only in its capacity as a business operator in the Ukrainian radio industry, alongside with all other radio broadcasters in Ukraine.\n\n156.\n\nI should finally note that no *denial of justice* has been pleaded. Beyond dispute, rule-of-law compliant remedies against flawed tender decisions are provided and are sufficiently effective.\n\n157.\n\nHence, the imperfections under Ukraine\u2019s sector legislation do **not** meet any of the criteria suggested in para. 148 supra for justifying protection under the FET standard131.\n\nNeither can these shortcomings serve as indicators of a \"practice\" in violation of the FET standard.\n\n**IV.B.2. Claimant has Acquiesced with the Imperfections of Ukrainian Radio Sector Legislation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nMoreover, Claimant has acquiesced with all aforementioned imperfections. These had already been enshrined in the initial version of the LTR of December 21, 1993132. Claimant thus was aware of these imperfections when he started his investments in the Ukrainian radio industry in 1995. He has not pleaded to have raised these imperfections as an issue in his negotiations with the National Council in preparation of his investment.\n\nThe system of appointing and dismissing the members of the National Council was set out in the *\"Law on National Television and Radio Council of Ukraine\"* of September 30, 1998. It was amended in 2006 to strengthen the Independence of Council Members.\n\n159.\n\nNeither does the Settlement Agreement of March 20, 2000 entail any reference to such imperfections133 nor has Claimant pleaded to have raised them in his negotiations of the Settlement Agreement. Rather, Claimant has continued to apply for frequencies under the procedure as established by law until 2008. He challenges the procedure for the first time in this arbitration.\n\nCf. paras. 18-22 supra.\n\n160.\n\nSuch conduct denotes a *venire contra factum proprium* or inconsistent behaviour under Article 1.8 of the UNIDROIT Principles.\n\n161.\n\nFor these reasons, the imperfections under Ukrainian sector legislation cannot support Claimant\u2019s claim under the FET standard.\n\n**V. CLAIMANT\u2019S RECORD IN TENDERS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**V.A.The Majority Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Majority further analyses the implications of Gala\u2019s failure of gaining additional frequencies in tenders between 2001 and 2008, i.e., after the Settlement Agreement (with the exception of one frequency in a small village)134. Claimant has presented his failure record as evidence of a pattern of conduct on the part of the National Council designed to block his plans of further expanding his business. The Majority opines *\"that the macro-statistical analysis cannot provide conclusive evidence that Respondent has violated the FET standard\"135.* To this extent I agree.\n\nSee paras. 318 - 331 of the Decision.\n\nSee para. 330 of the First Decision.\n\n163.\n\nThe Majority continues to conclude, though, that *\"the overall numbers, the absence of any reasonable explanation...are all factors which cast doubts on the decisions of the National Council\"* and that the individual tenders are analysed *\"in order to substantiate these doubts\"136.* it ignores the explanations offered by Respondent for Gala\u2019s dismal success record, namely that Gala\u2019s financial and technical resources were inadequate and that its programming concept was not competitive137.\n\nSee paras. 330, 331 of the First Decision.\n\nThese issues are only addressed in the Award in the context of computing Claimant\u2019s compensation.\n\n**V.B. My View**\n----------------\n\n**V.B.1. General Observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nGala\u2019s failure record during 2001 - 2008 in my view bears no relationship to the Award. The latter is based **solely** on the Interregnum from March 1999 through June 2000 and, in particular, the assumption that Gala would have operated an FM network with nationwide coverage as of January 2001 had it not been denied the requisite frequencies by the *\"irregular practice\"* during the Interregnum138.\n\nSee para. 279 in connection with paras. 236 - 274 of the Award.\n\n165.\n\nNevertheless, the Majority appears to draw conclusions from Gala\u2019s record during 2001-2008 with respect to the Interregnum practice139. For that reason, I will subsequently comment on the Majority\u2019s pertinent assessment140. My comments will rely on evidence presented during the first phase of the proceedings only, with cross-references to the Second Phase in footnotes.\n\nSee paras. 470 - 475 infra.\n\nSee paras. 318 - 331 of the First Decision.\n\n166.\n\nMy dissent from the Majority\u2019s assessment rests upon the latter\u2019s failure in the First Decision of taking Respondent\u2019s explanations into consideration. In my view, these are plausible and relevant. In a nutshell, the explanation for Gala\u2019s failure record is found in the relationship between Gala\u2019s market share on the one hand and its financial capacity and programming concept on the other hand.\n\n167.\n\nThe Majority addresses Respondent\u2019s pertinent explanations in the Award in the context of its analysis of the causal link between Respondent\u2019s assumed breaches of the FET standard and Claimant\u2019s loss141. In my Opinion, though, these explanations had (also) to be considered in the First Decision determining the question whether the National Council\u2019s tender decisions violated the FET standard. If the explanations held true, the National Council would have exercised its powers in accordance with the criteria set forth in the enabling legislation, i.e., the LTR. Absent any misuse of authority, the tender decisions could not be considered as breaches of the FET standard.\n\nSee paras. 187- 190 of the Award.\n\n**V.B.2. Specific Comments**\n----------------------------\n\n168.\n\nFirstly, the Majority Ignores the eleven frequencies which Gala received since 2001 in tender proceedings owing to the Settlement Agreement on a priority basis. With the benefit of these frequencies, Gala operates in thirteen cities of Ukraine, including the major centres142; and since 2007 Gala has the status of a \"\u2019\u2019national broadcaster\" under Article 23(4) of the 2006 version of the LTR. If these frequencies are included in Gala\u2019s tender record and the latter is compared with that of all twelve national broadcasters (rather than just the three top performers selected by Claimant and the Majority as benchmarks), Gala scored about average results in all tenders from 2001 through 2008 where it participated143.\n\nSee Respondents Rejoinder, para. 448 at p. 134 (information not contested by Claimant).\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-412, \"National radio broadcasting companies\u2019 participation to tenders 2001-today\".\n\n169.\n\nSecondly, the Majority does not consider Respondent\u2019s submission that Gala\u2019s financial resources are inadequate for a national broadcaster. Indeed, Claimant documented only an investment in Gala totalling USD 141,000144. Gala\u2019s balance sheet as of January 1, 2002 shows a net book value of just UAH 465,600 (roughly USD 51,000) and an equity of UAH 177,800 (USD 22,000)145. Respondent further noted considerable payment delays146.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Memorial Exhibit CM-126.\n\nSee Appendix D of EBS Report. Exchange rate USD : UAH roughly 1 : 8; see Award, para. 271.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 454 and PHM, paras. 621 -624.\n\n170.\n\nClaimant did not contest the above figures or refute Respondent\u2019s submission that Gala\u2019s recorded resources as such were inadequate. He rather alleged that Claimant continuously provided off-the-record financial support to Gala so that behind Gala stood the personal wealth of Claimant. The Majority to some extent follows this submission by noting that *\"the personal assets of Mr. Lemire and those of Gala appear to some extent commingled\"* and that *\"the evidence shows that Mr. Lemire has made payments with his own money on behalf of Gala\".* Yet, the Majority also observes that *\"the record of the actual amounts paid has not been produced, and that the total exceeds 5,000,000 USD is nothing more than affirmation\"147.*\n\nSee paras. 52 - 54 of the First Decision.  \n In the Award, the Majority estimates Claimant\u2019s total investment in Gala to cluster somewhere between USD 2 and 3 million, (para.301 of the Award).\n\n171.\n\nWhile the Majority thus pays attention to the magnitude of Claimant\u2019s investment in Gala148, it fails to consider Respondent\u2019s submission that Gala\u2019s weak capital casts doubts on its credibility as a contender for frequencies in addition to the ones already held. Yet pursuant to Article 30(2)(d) of the LTR, the National Council ***\"shall***  *deny the issuance of a license upon a tender application if (...) the applicant does not have the capacity (financial, economic, technical) to run a broadcasting operation within the defined broadcast requirements\".* Respondent\u2019s pertinent submission thus is to the point and had to be taken into account.\n\nThe Majority addresses the issue only with a view to *\"jurisdiction ratione materiae\"* and the question of a *\"common sense correlation\"* between the magnitude of the investment and the loss of profits awarded.\n\n172.\n\nIn assessing Gala\u2019s capacity, the National Council, as regulator of the Industry, had to rely on the financial records and other evidence submitted by Gala in conjunction with its tender applications and in compliance with Ukrainian law. As Gala is a closed joint stock company, Claimant had no legal obligation of subsidizing Gala\u2019s operations from his personal wealth. Neither has Claimant pleaded to have presented to the National Council any legally binding undertaking to inject additional capital Into Gala. Whatever unrecorded support Claimant may have provided to Gala, such support was neither transparent nor reliable. It could not to be taken into account by the National Council in assessing Gala\u2019s capacity. If the National Council thus downgraded Gala\u2019s tender applications in light of its modest capital base (as recorded in its financial statements and reflected in its payment record), it did no more than its statutory duty149.\n\nin the Award (para. 301), the Majority concludes that Claimant over time has Injected an additional USD 2-3 million Into Gala off-the record. Unrecorded financial support in this magnitude Implies fundamental Inaccuracy of Gala\u2019s financial statements (see paras 535 - 539 Infra).\n\n173.\n\nThirdly, Respondent has submitted that Gala\u2019s failure in post-Settlement Agreement tenders were largely due to its program concept which had lost attractiveness over time and was not conducive to further expansion - another aspect not addressed by the Majority in the present context. Gala\u2019s brand recognition was that of a music broadcaster with a focus on contemporary hits, notably International ones. While this concept had been popular when Gala started, it had, according to Respondent, since been replicated by other radio stations (thus loosing uniqueness) and faded in light of an Increasing popularity of Ukrainian music. As per Respondent, Gala has failed to develop its program over time in response to changing trends150.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder at paras. 463 - 472. Cf. also paras. 313, 314 Infra.\n\n174.\n\nArticle 28 of the LTR sets out detailed requirements for program concepts. As confirmed by Claimant\u2019s expert witness151, the competitiveness of the program concept, in conjunction with the capacity properly to implement the program, were the principal determinants of success in tender proceedings. As also noted by Claimant\u2019s expert witness, special importance is attached to the contribution of the program concept *\"to the diversity of the market\".* Respondent\u2019s submission in this respect had to be considered as a possible explanation of Claimant\u2019s dismal record in post-Settlement Agreement tenders.\n\nSee para. 116 above.\n\n175.\n\nWhere Claimant had to develop its program concept in response to tender requirements, the National Council had to consider the question whether Gala had the requisite resources to do so satisfactorily. The credibility of plans for developing the program concept thus became dovetailed with the demonstration of adequate financial resources.\n\n176.\n\nFourthly, the two aspects - adequacy of Gala\u2019s resources and attractiveness of its program concept - had to be related to Gala\u2019s market share. The key question for National Council members in deciding on Gala\u2019s quest for additional frequencies was: Does Gala have the resources to Invest into additional operations without sacrifice to performance quality; and does its submitted program concept contribute to the quality and diversity of the radio broadcasting so as to prevail over its contenders? Gala\u2019s financial records could Inspire scepticism regarding Gala\u2019s capacity of simultaneously extending its technical infrastructure and launching additional programs.\n\n177.\n\nThus, Respondent has in my view offered a reasonable, and even plausible, explanation for Gala\u2019s dismal success record in its applications for additional frequencies: a perception on the part of National Council members that the Ukrainian market was already saturated with Gala-type music programs and that Gala lacked sufficient resources to develop new programs and technical capacities152.\n\nThese aspects are discussed in detail in the Third Witness Statement of Ihor Kurus submitted in the second phase of the proceedings.\n\n178.\n\nSuch concerns may have pervaded all challenged tender decisions. They are supported by facts (e.g., Gala\u2019s financial records and the relatively narrow focus of its program experience); and they relate to principal criteria enshrined in the enabling LTR. No fault can in my view be found if such concerns were weighted against Gala in actual tender proceedings in light of the specific tender conditions and the comparative strength of contenders. Hence, the macro-setting furnishes possible justifications of the challenged tender decisions rather than casting a *priori -* doubts on them.\n\n179.\n\nThe explanations offered must be appreciated in the context of the National Council\u2019s judgmental discretion. The Tribunal cannot substitute its own policy judgment for the National Council\u2019s. It can only find fault with a decision if a misuse of administrative discretion is proven.\n\n**VI. THE ALLOCATION OF FREQUENCIES DURING THE PERIOD WHEN THE NATIONAL COUNCIL WAS NOTOPERATIVE (THE \"INTERREGNUM\")**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**VI.A. The Majority Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nDuring March 1999 through June 2000, the National Council was inoperative so that no tenders could be organized (the \"Interregnum\"). Nevertheless, the Ukrainian State Centre for Radio Frequencies (\"UCRF\") allotted frequencies to some broadcasters and permitted (at least by acquiescence) broadcasting on such frequencies. Upon becoming operational again, the National Council on January 1, 2001 organized a first tender reserved to twenty-five of the broadcasters concerned and condoned the allocation of frequencies to these broadcasters.\n\n181.\n\nRespondent had submitted that this practice was reserved to licences for frequencies which had been awarded by the National Council before the Interregnum and expired during the Interregnum. The Majority dismissed this argument with reference to the 2006 version of the LTR which did not require a tender for the renewal of broadcasting licences, unlike the version of the LTR in force at the time153.\n\nSee paras. 412 - 414 of the First Decision.\n\n182.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s opinion, *\"Respondent\u2019s above described practice constitutes a violation of the FET standard established in Article 11.3 of the BIT, because it facilitates the secret awarding of licences, without transparency, with total disregard of the process of law and without any possibility of judicial review. The practice must be considered arbitrary, since it meets the Saluka test of \"manifestly violatjing] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination. The lack of propriety is such that -as the test was articulated in Teemed and Loewen - the practice also \"shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety\"154.*\n\nSee para. 418 of the First Decision.\n\n**VI.B. My View**\n-----------------\n\n183.\n\nWhile condemning the Interregnum practice, the Majority falls to explain how the practice violates Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard. Gala had never applied for frequencies allocated during the Interregnum. At most, it was deprived of an opportunity to apply for them due to the diversion of these frequencies from the tender process as prescribed in the LTR. If at all, Gala was affected only in his business prospects as an operator in the Ukrainian radio industry, alongside with all other broadcasters in Ukraine at the time (safe the few which had benefited from the practice).\n\n184.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s assessment of the Interregnum practice furthermore is not consistent with the undisputed facts. The process was not secret. The tender of January 1, 2001 had been announced; and all frequencies allocated during the Interregnum were recorded in an official list. On the basis of this list, Claimant has Identified 32 frequencies allegedly available for allocation to Gala155.\n\nSee Exhibit R-209 and Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, para. 37 and note 63. Cf. also paras. 526 - 529 infra.\n\n185.\n\nPursuant to article 25(6) of the LTR, every licensed broadcaster was entitled to participate in tenders. If denied participation, the broadcaster was entitled to a *\"reasoned decision\"* of the National Council within thirty days of its application (Article 25(8) of LTR). Neither has Claimant submitted nor is there any Indication that this entitlement did not apply to the January 1, 2001 tender. The process thus did not exclude *\"any possibility of judicial review\".*\n\n186.\n\nMoreover, Claimant has not in time pleaded any claim arising from the allocation of frequencies during the Interregnum. The Interregnum in most part pre-dates the Settlement Agreement wherein Claimant has waived all previous claims. And by securing frequencies under the Settlement Agreement, Claimant has benefited from an administrative process similar to the one during the Interregnum.\n\n187.\n\nAgainst this background, my comments will address both procedural and substantive Issues. The procedural issues concern :\n\n1. Claimant\u2019s failure of pleading (ne *ultra petita* and *audiatur et altera pars*); and\n\n2. Claimant\u2019s waiver of claims under the Settlement Agreement;\n\nThe substantive Issues cover:\n\n3. Pleading a practice used for Claimant\u2019s benefit; and\n\n4. Illegality of the Interregnum practice and its coverage by the FET.\n\n**VI.B.1. Failure of Pleading**\n-------------------------------\n\n***VI.B.1.a. Ne Ultra Petita***\n-------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nClaimant has submitted that the Interregnum practice was Illegal and that the tender of January 1, 2001 implied a violation of Respondent\u2019s obligation under Article 13 (b) of the Settlement Agreement to provide Gala with the broadcasting licences specified in the Settlement Agreement in due time. As per Claimant, the National Council had an obligation to avail itself of the opportunity of the first tender after the Council\u2019s reconstitution to award the broadcasting licenses specified in the Settlement Agreement to Gala or to authorize Gala straightaway to broadcast on the frequencies which it had already obtained from the State Committee in performance of the Settlement Agreement. However, Claimant has not, **prior to the First Decision,** pleaded a claim under the FET standard on account of Gala\u2019s alleged deprivation of opportunities to apply in tenders for frequencies allotted during the Interregnum.\n\n189.\n\nClaimant has first referred to the Interregnum in his Reply Memorial under the heading \"Respondent Did Not Comply With its Obligation To Use its Best Efforts To Award Frequencies To Gala Radio Pursuant To The Settlement Agreement/Award\"156. And in para. 134 of his Reply Memorial, Claimant specifically focused on frequencies in the cities specified in the Settlement Agreement157. In his Post Hearing Memorial, Claimant similarly mentioned the Interregnum under the heading \"Respondent\u2019s breach of the Settlement Agreement\" and expressly related it only to Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to perform in time under clause 13 (b) of the Settlement Agreement158. Moreover, Claimant enumerated Respondent\u2019s actions or Inactions which in his view constituted violations of the FET standard. While these include all tenders challenged, they neither encompass the Interregnum practice nor the February 1, tender legalizing this practice post facto159.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, pp. 57, 59, 60 (paras. 134 - 135).\n\nPara. 135 of the Reply Memorial might be understood as submitting that the National Council in the January 1, 2001 tender awarded frequencies in cities named in the Settlement Agreement. This does not alter the fact, though, that Claimant did not claim any entitlement to frequencies on top of those eventually received in performance of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing Memorial, pp. 37, 39, 40 (para. 57.2).\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing Memorial, p. 2 (Table of Contents).\n\n190.\n\nHence, the Majority\u2019s decision, establishing Respondent\u2019s liability on account of the Interregnum160, has no basis in Claimant\u2019s pleading. It violates the fundamental arbitration principle of *ne ultra petita161.*\n\nSee para. 421 of the First Decision\n\nSee paras 517 - 524 Infra on the Majority\u2019s comments in point.\n\n***VI.B.1.b. Audiatur et Altera Pars***\n---------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nSince Claimant had not, prior to the First Decision, pleaded a violation of his rights under the FET standard during the Interregnum, the topic was never discussed in the first phase of the proceedings162. Respondent had thus no opportunity to react to the assumptions underlying the Majority\u2019s analysis. The analysis rests on key assumptions disproved by documentary evidence submitted in the Second Phase of the proceedings.\n\nThe references to Parties\u2019 submissions regarding the Interregnum practice in the First Decision concern both the discussion of the topic in the context of Respondent\u2019s performance under the Settlement Agreement (see notes 161 and 162 at p. 85 of the First Decision).\n\n192.\n\nThus, the Majority considers as crucial whether the Interregnum practice applied only to broadcasters whose licenses had expired during the Interregnum period (Respondent\u2019s submission) or whether radio companies were granted frequencies *ab initio \"through a nontransparent and closed procedure that was not available to Claimant\"* (Claimant\u2019s submission). And the Majority finds that *\"there is strong evidence that Claimant\u2019s explanation is the correct one\"163.*\n\nSee paras. 412, 413 of the First Decision.\n\n193.\n\nAs primary evidence, the Majority relies on Articles 24.9 and 33.7 of the LTR which entitle broadcasters to renewal of their licenses without requiring a tender (subject to limited exceptions). This evidence was tenuous at best already at the time of the First Decision.\n\n194.\n\nFirstly, the Majority relied on the 2006 version of the LTR. Yet, the LTR had until March 2006 been amended 19tlmes since its promulgation in 1993. No complete version of the LTR as of the time of the Interregnum period and the January 1, 2001 tender had been submitted to the Tribunal before the First Decision. The Majority could not assume as a foregone conclusion that the 2006 version of the LTR reflected the regulation in force during 1999-2000.\n\n195.\n\nSecondly, pursuant to Article 33(7)(a) of the 2006 LTR, a broadcaster forfeits its entitlement to an extension of a broadcasting license if it falls to apply for the extension at least 180 days before the relevant expiration date. Since the National Council had been Inoperative during the Interregnum period of some 15 months, at least some broadcasters had likely been unable to apply for extension in time, thus had lost their entitlement to renewal of licenses and had to re-obtaln their licenses through tenders.\n\n196.\n\nThirdly, the National Council organized a tender on January 1, 2001 to legalize the allocation of frequencies during the Interregnum ex *post facto.* The Majority assumes Illegality of this action as a foregone conclusion.\n\n197.\n\nMr. S. Aksenenko\u2019s letter of September 28, 1999 and Claimant\u2019s transcript of a meeting with Mr. Koholod164 alone clearly lack sufficient specificity to qualify as evidence sustaining the Majority\u2019s\u2019 conclusion. Both documents just suggest that during the Interregnum *\"some bad things were happening\",* but fall to provide further clarification. The letter of Mr. Aksenenko mentions some examples, but these do not Include the practice of the UCRF to allocate frequencies *ab initio* to some broadcasters as assumed by the Majority165.\n\nSee paras. 415, 416 of the Decision.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Exhibit CM -11.\n\n198.\n\nIn response to the First Decision, Respondent submitted that all frequencies covered by the January 1, 2001 tender concern cases where broadcasters had previously held a valid licence which had expired during the Interregnum period. He produced the version of the LTR in force at that time showing that broadcasters had to seek renewal of expired licences in a new tender but enjoyed priority in that tender166. Only subsequently was the LTR amended to the effect that renewals did not require a new tender as assumed by the Majority at the start of its analysis.\n\nExhibit RLA-107.\n\n199.\n\nAs soon as given the opportunity, Respondent has thus produced documentary evidence that the Majority\u2019s key assumption was false. The decision declaring the Interregnum practice a violation of the FET standard represents a \"surprise decision\" depriving Respondent of its right to be heard in time. It thus violates the maxim of *audiatur et altera pars.*\n\n**VI.B.2. Claimant\u2019s Waiver of Claims under the Settlement Agreement**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nClause 12 of the Settlement Agreement provides: *\"The Parties acknowledge the absence of any claims or misunderstandings between them as on the date of signing this Agreement\".* The Settlement Agreement was signed on March 20, 2000. The Interregnum covered the period from March 16, 1999 through June 9, 2000167. In most part, it thus predates the signing of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee para. 409 of the First Decision.\n\n201.\n\nAs per the Majority\u2019s decision, the out-of-tender allocation of frequencies during the Interregnum violated Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard. If this decision is accepted *arguendo,* then the violations occurred whenever frequencies were allocated during the Interregnum which lawfully would have been put to tender, offering Gala an opportunity to apply for them. Claimant\u2019s rights were thus violated at the time of out-of-tender allocations of frequencies.\n\n202.\n\nClaimant\u2019s pertinent claims under the FET standard arose *ipso iure* with the violation of his rights, i.e., simultaneously with the - assumedly illegal - out-of-tender allocation of frequencies. All claims related to allocations between March 16, 1999 (start of the Interregnum) and March 20, 2000 (signing of the Settlement Agreement) are thus covered by the waiver under clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n203.\n\nClaimant has not identified any out-of-tender allocations of frequencies in the period between March 20 and June 9, 2000 not covered by the terms of clause 12. He had to prove the violations of the FET standard and thus at least to Identify the allocations alleged to constitute the violations. Absent such Identification, it must be assumed that no allocations occurred during the relatively short period of the Interregnum post-dating the waiver.\n\n204.\n\nHence, all claims on account of the Interregnum have effectively been waived by Claimant pursuant to section 12 of the Settlement Agreement168,169.\n\nCf. paras. 497 - 513 infra on the Majority\u2019s critique in point.\n\nlt should also be noted that Claimant had, prior to this arbitration, not expressed any interest in frequencies allotted during the Interregnum. He had discussed the Interregnum practice with then -Chairman of the National Council Kholod and others, in a meeting dated March 19, 2001, i.e., after the January 1, 2001 tender (Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 135 and Exhibit CRM - 101). Although Claimant in this meeting noted the illegality of the Interregnum practice, he concentrated only on delays in obtaining the broadcasting licenses specified in the Settlement Agreement.\n\n**VI.B.3. Violation of the FET Standard Although Claimant Benefitted from the Practice?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nClaimant, with the Settlement Agreement, negotiated priority for eleven out of Gala\u2019s thirteen frequencies in derogation from tender procedure prescribed by the LTR. This process exhibits striking similarities with the administrative practice during the Interregnum:\n\n\u25a0 The Settlement Agreement was negotiated co-termlnus with the Interregnum.\n\n\u25a0 The Settlement Agreement was negotiated with the Vice Prime Minister for Economy while administrative actions during the Interregnum were taken by the UCRF - without Involvement of the National Council in charge under the law but inoperative at the time.\n\n\u25a0 Under the Settlement Agreement, Claimant received first frequencies from the State Committee and subsequently the requisite broadcasting licenses from the National Council upon the latter\u2019s reconstitution. Similarly, broadcasters during the Interregnum were permitted by the UCRF to broadcast on the frequencies allotted and subsequently received the requisite licences from the National Council170.\n\n\u25a0 The subsequent decisions of the National Council were formally taken in tenders but actually accorded priority to Claimant and holders of frequencies received during the Interregnum, respectively.\n\nAccordingly, 9 of the frequencies obtained by Claimant under the Settlement Agreement were recorded in Ukraine\u2019s official list of frequencies allotted during the Interregnum (see Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 170, 171).\n\n206.\n\nAs noted before (para. 183), the Interregnum practice could have affected Gala only by depriving it of the opportunity of applying for frequencies allotted to other broadcasters in tenders consonant with the LTR. In this respect, Gala found itself in the same position as all other broadcasters in Ukraine at the time not benefiting from the practice.\n\n207.\n\nGala\u2019s position in relation to the Interregnum practice is similar to the position of other broadcasters in Ukraine in relation to Gala\u2019s treatment under the Settlement Agreement. While Gala was deprived of the opportunity to compete for frequencies allotted during the Interregnum, Gala\u2019s competitors were denied the opportunity of competing for the eleven frequencies awarded to Gala pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.\n\n208.\n\nWith a view to *bona fide broadcasters in Ukraine,* Gala\u2019s treatment under the Settlement Agreement can in terms of propriety not be distinguished from the Interregnum practice on the ground that the Settlement Agreement sought to redress an injustice done to Claimant. Firstly, the settled arbitration proceedings had not advanced to any decision on the merits so that no Injustice to Claimant had been determined. Secondly, even if any Injustice had been done, this would not have justified violation of the procedures and competencies enshrined in the LTR. Thirdly and most Importantly, any injustice done to Claimant could not have justified violations of the rights of Innocent contenders for the frequencies granted to Claimant.\n\n209.\n\nThe dilemma becomes even more apparent if it is hypostasized that the contenders for frequencies granted to Claimant Included another BIT protected investor. In such case, Ukraine, as per the theory advanced by the Majority, would have incurred liability towards that investor under the FET standard of the BIT by granting frequencies to Claimant on a priority basis; and Ukraine would have become liable to Claimant under the Settlement Agreement by falling to grant him priority as promised.\n\n210.\n\nIn the final analysis, the substance of the Settlement Agreement and its negotlation/concluslon without participation of the National Council can only be justified on the theory that during the Interregnum the provisions of the LTR presupposing an operative National Council were suspended. The legality of the Settlement Agreement under either Ukrainian or potentially International law has not been challenged. Moreover, the Settlement Agreement has been recorded by the Tribunal into an award on agreed terms; this implies that the Tribunal had no doubt as to the legality of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n211.\n\nThe rationale for the legality of the Settlement Agreement would *mutatis mutandis* apply to the Interregnum practice so that no violation by this practice of either municipal Ukrainian law or the FET standard of the BIT could have been determined on the basis of the facts submitted to the Tribunal.\n\n212.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Interregnum practice did violate Ukrainian law, the Settlement Agreement did likewise. Invoking a claim under the FET standard on account of a practice used by Claimant to his benefit would denote a *venire contra factum proprium* or inconsistent behaviour, contrary to Article 1.8 of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles.\n\n**VI.B.4. Illegality of the Interregnum Practice and its Coverage by the FET Standard**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***VI.B.4.a. Illegality of the Interregnum Practice under Ukrainian Law***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s assessment, the Interregnum practice violates Ukrainian law simply because it falls short of the procedures established in the LTR. True, Article 14 of the LTR required tenders under the aegis of the National Council. Yet, this does not necessarily imply that during a period when no National Council existed *interim* actions of the UCRF were *ipso iure* illegal and that deficiencies could not be cured subsequently by the National Council upon its reconstitution. Possibly, the provisions of the LTR pre-supposing an operative National Council had as a matter of impossibility of compliance been suspended during the Interregnum period by operation of general constitutional and/or administrative law of Ukraine.\n\n214.\n\nThe above question was neither addressed by the Parties nor the Tribunal. Neither the procedures of the UCRF in allocating frequencies were analysed (Did the UCRF just allot frequencies at will or did it use some rational criteria?) nor the pertinent decision-making of the National Council (Did it just rubber-stamp the measures of the UCRF or did it condone them upon substantive review?). Without such an analysis, however, the Majority has no basis for concluding that the practice violated Ukrainian law. In the absence of substantiated submissions of the Parties in point, it must in my view be assumed that the practice was legal. If the practice was legal, it cannot, at least not without further reasoning, be considered as a violation of the FET standard.\n\n215.\n\nThe inadequacy of submissions and analysis in point follows from Claimant\u2019s failure of pleading a claim on account of the Interregnum to begin with. And it underscores the deprivation of Respondent\u2019s Right to be Heard in time.\n\n***VI.B.4.b. Extension of the FET Standard to the Interregnum***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nEven if it is *arguendo* assumed that the Interregnum practice did violate Ukrainian law, Claimant in my opinion would still not be affected in his rights under the FET standard. As noted before (para. 183), Gala had never applied for frequencies allocated during the Interregnum. At most, it was deprived of an opportunity to apply for them due to the fact that these frequencies were not tendered in strict compliance with the LTR. This scenario begs the question whether the FET standard bestowed an entitlement, a subjective right, on Claimant to the allocation of all frequencies in Ukraine through tenders satisfying the LTR. The answer must in my opinion be negative.\n\n217.\n\nThere exists no direct link between the Interregnum practice and Claimant, let alone Claimant in his capacity as a foreign investor. At most, Claimant was affected as an investor in the Ukrainian radio industry alongside with all other radio broadcasters in Ukraine (whether foreign or domestically owned), except those which benefited from the Interregnum practice.\n\n218.\n\nApplying the FET standard to the Interregnum process implies an unprecedented extension of FET protection to the general administrative regime in the host country. It would enable BIT investors to challenge any practice adversely affecting their business prospects under the FET standard, on account of any alleged Impropriety. Nothing suggests, though, that the BIT Parties intended to upgrade the FET standard to a comprehensive protection of business prospects against adverse framework conditions. With a view to the radio sector, such an interpretation would diametrically fly into the face of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation of sovereign regulatory powers171.\n\nSee paras. 129 - 138 supra.\n\n**VI.C. Conclusions**\n---------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s decision that the occurrences during the Interregnum violate Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard of the BIT in my opinion:\n\n1. Exceeds the powers of the Tribunal;\n\n2. Departs from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n3. Entails errors of substantive law.\n\n**VI.C.1. Excess of Powers**\n----------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s decision in my view exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers by\n\na. Awarding a claim not pleaded *(\"ne ultra petita\");*\n\nb. Disregarding the waiver of the awarded claim under the Settlement Agreement *(\"res judicata\u2019)',* and\n\nc. Extending the FET standard beyond its limits under the BIT.\n\n***VI.C.1.a. Ne Ultra Petita***\n-------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nAs explained in paras. 188 - 190 supra, the Majority awards a claim not pleaded and violates the principle of *\"ne ultra petita\".* it thus exceeds the scope of Claimant\u2019s *Request for Arbitration* as filed prior to the First Decision. The *Request,* together with the BIT and the ICSID Convention, constitutes the arbitration agreement prescribing the Tribunal\u2019s powers. By determining Respondent\u2019s liability towards Claimant on account of a violation of the BIT not pleaded, the Majority exceeds *\"the scope of the task which the parties have charged the Tribunal to perform in discharge of its mandate\".* it hence exceeds the powers of the Tribunal172.\n\n*Helnan,* fn. 32, paras. 40, 41\n\n***VI.C.1.b. Res Judicata***\n----------------------------\n\n222.\n\nAs explained in paras. 200 - 204 supra, the Majority ignores the Settlement Agreement wherein Claimant has waived of any claims that might have arisen during the Interregnum. The Settlement Agreement, as an *Award on Agreed Terms,* established *res judicata.* Claims due to the Interregnum were thus precluded from consideration in this arbitration. By awarding such claims, the Majority exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers173.\n\nCompare paras. 33 - 38 supra.\n\n***VI.C.1.c. Malapplication of the FET Standard***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nAs explained in paras. 213 - 218 supra, the Majority, by applying the FET standard to the Interregnum occurrences, extends the standard beyond its ambit under the BIT. Thus, it transcends the scope of BIT protection and, as a consequence, the Tribunal\u2019s powers.\n\n**VI.C.2. Departure from Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAs explained in paras. 191 - 199 supra, the Majority\u2019s decision on the Interregnum practice represents a \"surprise decision\" depriving Respondent of its opportunity of timely defence. Affording both parties an equal and adequate opportunity to be heard on all issues materially affecting their legal position is fundamental in adversarial proceedings. It is expressed in the maxim of *\"audiatur et altera pars\"* and reflected throughout the Arbitration Rules. A *\"surprise decision\"* resting on a theory that could not have been anticipated by the losing party, without providing such party an opportunity to be heard, violates the *\"audiatur et altera pars\"* maxim174.\n\nGary B.Born, *International Commercial Arbitration,* vol. II, Wolters Kluwer, 2009, p. 2589\n\n225.\n\nThis maxim constitutes *\"a fundamental rule of procedure\"175.* Disregarding the maxim, the Majority\u2019s decision departs from such a rule.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer. The *ICSID Convention : A Commentary,* 2nd ed., 2009, article 52, notes 305 - 317.\n\n**VI.C.3. Substantive Errors**\n------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nIn substance, the Majority\u2019s fails to take into account the fact that the Interregnum practice (if improper) entails similarly unfair priority treatment of certain broadcasters over Claimant as does the priority treatment of Claimant over competing broadcasters under the Settlement Agreement. Claimant in my view is estopped from invoking unfairness of a practice similar to the practice he has negotiated to his benefit.\n\n227.\n\nFinally, the Majority assumes illegality of the Interregnum Practice without sufficient analysis of Ukrainian law.\n\n**VII. TENDERS 2004 - 2008**\n----------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Majority decides that certain tender decisions between May 2004 and February 2008 violate Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard176.\n\nPara. 421 in conjunction with paras. 332 - 408 of the First Decision.\n\n229.\n\nThe Award is based solely on occurrences during the Interregnum March 1999 - June 2000177. The aforementioned tender decisions are thus not relevant to the Award. For that reason, I will confine myself to few summary observations.\n\nParas. 256, 261 of the Award.\n\n230.\n\nIn all aforementioned tenders Gala lost together with 2 to 14 (at least predominantly) domestic contenders. Claimant has neither pleaded that the adverse tender decisions were specifically directed against Gala/Claimant, nor has there been any indication to this effect. The decisions did not involve any discrimination of Claimant, let alone in his capacity as foreign Investor. At most, Claimant/Gala suffered a *\"reverse discrimination\",* alongside with several domestically-owned contenders. Such discrimination does not meet the criteria suggested by the Majority for a *\"discriminatory measure\" under* article II 3 (b) of the BIT178.\n\nPara. 261 of the First Decision. See paras. 457 -469 on the Majority\u2019s critique in point.\n\n231.\n\nIn essence, the Majority\u2019s determinations regarding the aforementioned tenders are based on - assumed - violations of Ukrainian legislation governing the tender process. These are upgraded to *\"arbitrary measures\" under* article II 3 (b) of the BIT by construing the FET standard as an \"umbrella clause\"179. As explained in paras. 121 - 128 supra, I cannot agree with this approach.\n\nMost clearly para. 385 of the First Decision: *\"Although not every violation of domestic law necessarily translates into an arbitrary or discriminatory measure under international law and a violation of the FET standard, in the Tribunal\u2019s view a blatant disregard of applicable tender rules, distorting fair competition among tender participants, does\".* Cf. paras. 476 -478 infra on the Majority\u2019s critique in point.\n\n**PART TWO: THE AWARD OF MARCH 2011 (THE \"AWARD\")**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**OVERVIEW**\n------------\n\n232.\n\nThe First Decision has defined Respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT. These provide the legal basis for determining Claimant\u2019s loss attributable to these violations. Quantification of loss and causal link between the violations and the loss are the issues that remaining for the Award180\n\nA third issue reserved to the Award is Claimant\u2019s claim for moral damages due to alleged harassment. The Majority dismisses this claim (paras. 325 - 345 of the Award). I concur with this decision. However, I do not agree with the statement that *\"Mr. Lemire was mistreated by his regulator\"* (para. 344). And I note the statement *\"that the moral aspects of his injuries have already been compensated by the awarding of a significant amount of compensation\"* (para. 344). The statement must be appreciated in the context of the Majority\u2019s liberal estimation of damages (paras. 369 - 380 infra).\n\n233.\n\nThe Award is based solely on the assumed violation of Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard of article II.3. of the BIT by Respondent\u2019s administrative practice during the Interregnum181. The Majority dismisses additional claims on account of other tenders that have breached the FET standard according to the First Decision.182 I agree with the dismissal of these claims, although not necessarily the underlying reasoning. My subsequent comments therefore focus on the Interregnum.\n\nParas. 256, 261 of the Award.\n\nParas. 257 - 260 of the Award.\n\n234.\n\nIn Part One, Chapter VI of my Opinion, I have explained my objections against the Majority\u2019s decision that occurrences during the Interregnum breach the FET standard and provide a legal basis for Respondent\u2019s liability towards Claimant. The Award rests solely on this practice. It is thus infected with all procedural and factual errors underlying the Majority\u2019s decision of declaring the Interregnum Practice a violation of the FET standard183\n\nParas. 219-227 supra.\n\n235.\n\nI will nevertheless accept the Majority\u2019s decision on the Interregnum practice *arguendo* as basis of my subsequent comments on the Award. These will address the:\n\n(I) Causal Links between the Interregnum and Claimant\u2019s Loss;\n\n(II) Implausibility of the Award; and\n\n(III) Allocation of Costs.\n\n**I. CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN THE INTERREGNUM AND CLAIMANT\u2019S LOSS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.A. Submissions of the Parties and Guidance of the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.A.1. Submissions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe issue of causation was controversially discussed between the Parties throughout the Second Phase of this arbitration; and the Tribunal on several occasions advised the Parties on its position in point184.\n\nWhile these discussions covered all tender situations qualified in para. 421 of the First Decision as violations of the FET standard, they also apply to the Interregnum practice alone.\n\n237.\n\nClaimant has consistently submitted that the causal link between Respondent\u2019s violation of the FET standard and Claimant\u2019s loss had already been decided by the Tribunal in the First Decision as a matter of *res judicata.185* As a consequence, he has not addressed the issue in his Memorial on Remaining Issues.\n\nPara 125 of the Award and HTRI, p. 28. See also paras. 239 -248 infra on the communications during the Second Phase of the proceedings.\n\n238.\n\nRespondent has likewise consistently argued that the issue of causation had not been decided in the First Decision but rather reserved to the Award. In his view, *\"Claimant is not entitled to assume causation, but must prove it\".* Without prejudice to Claimant\u2019s burden of proof, Respondent has reviewed the tender situations specified in para. 421 of the First Decision as violations of the FET standard (the \"para. 421 incidents\") and substantiated his position that Gala could not have won any frequencies in these Incidents even if all procedures and criteria prescribed by law had been fully compiled with. As evidence, Respondent has submitted a witness statement of former National Council Member Kurus (the \"WS Kurus\")186, together with documentary evidence. Respondent has requested dismissal of claims for damages due to Claimant\u2019s failure of showing the required causal connection between Ukraine\u2019s assumed wrongdoing and Claimant\u2019s loss187\n\nThird Witness Statement of Ihor Kurus, dated June 16, 2010.\n\nParas. 133 -137 of the Award and paras. 131 - 299 of Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues.\n\n**I.A.2. Guidance of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n***I.A.2.a. Telephone Conference of March 1, 2010***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nOn March 1, 2010, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with counsels of the Parties to discuss the procedure of the Second Phase in the wake of the First Decision. In his introductory remarks, the Chairman noted that the *\"point of liability\"* had been defined narrower in the First Decision than asserted by Claimant. He suggested that the Parties in the Second Phase concentrate on recalibrating Claimant\u2019s damages in light of the *\"narrowing down of the issues of liability\"* in the First Decision188\n\nAudio procedural conference, March 1, 2010 (\"Audio\"), 8:10 - 8:40.\n\n240.\n\nSubsequently, I clarified the narrowed down liability base as follows: *\"The calculations now have to be related clearly to the four incidents specified in para. 421 of the* [First] *Decision\".* I then explained that the required determinations will have to include the causal link between the four incidents and Claimant\u2019s damage189\n\nAudio, 38:05-39:20.\n\n241.\n\nThe Chairman confirmed this explanation: *\"We had now* [in the First Decision] *carefully* *defined the actions which have damaged......there are two issues of course: causation and* *quantification\"190.*\n\nAudio, 40:10-41:00.\n\n***I.A.2.b. Communications between March 1 (Telephone Conference) and July 12, 2010 (Hearings)***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nOn March 4, 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on the procedure during the Second Phase. It decided that the final Hearing be held on July 12, 2010 and that the admission of post-hearing submissions be decided in that Hearing.\n\n243.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, Respondent requested the production of documents from Claimant in accordance with the aforementioned Procedural Order. The request included all applications by *\"Gala Radio and Energy Media for the frequencies allocated by the National Council\u2019s decisions referenced in paragraph 421\"* of the First Decision. Respondent considered these documents as *\"relevant and material to the establishment of a causal link between Respondent\u2019s breaches and Claimant\u2019s alleged damages\".*\n\n244.\n\nOn May 11, 2010, Claimant objected to the aforementioned request on the ground that the issue had already been decided by the First Decision. In Claimant\u2019s view, \"a *causal link between Respondent\u2019s breaches and Claimant\u2019s damages was already established\"* by the First Decision. Respondent, on May 17, 2010 countered that the *\"causation issue remains an open issue for the Tribunal\u2019s next determination, as the Tribunal itself noted during the telephone conference held on March 1, 2010\".*\n\n245.\n\nIn a letter of June 25, 2010 (reiterating in part a letter of February 25, 2010), Claimant summarized the questions pending in the Second Phase as follows: *\"Adapting Gala Radio\u2019s different damages scenarios in the Report to the Tribunal\u2019s holding at paragraph 421 of the* [First] *Decision (...)\".* He also objected to Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues (the \"CMRI\") on the ground that it addressed the issue of causation and had attached the aforementioned WS Kurus. Claimant requested to strike both the pertinent section of Respondent\u2019s CMRI and the WS Kurus from the record.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal, on June 29, 2010, denied this request and advised that *\"The Tribunal has already given clear instructions to the parties, both in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, and the conference call held with the parties on March 1, 2010, regarding the issues which remain outstanding in this phase of the proceedings, which include quantification of damages*  ***and the relation between the unfair and inequitable treatment and the damages requested\"*** (emphasis provided).\n\n***I.A.2.c. Hearing on Remaining Issues on January 12, 2010***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn the Hearing on Remaining Issues on January 12, 2010, my colleague Jan Paulsson, in the context of Respondent\u2019s opening statement, drew the attention to the loss-of-chance scenario: *\"I have a question for you at this stage, because I think it may colour the way I try to understand what happens in the rest of the day (...) I believe in fact that claimant has* *been putting forward to some extent a loss of chance case\".* Mr. Paulsson continued to explain this concept with a view to \"causation\"191.\n\nSee HTRI, pp. 85-89.\n\n248.\n\nIn his closing statement, Respondent again reiterated his position that Claimant has pleaded loss of certainty rather than loss of chance: *\"The Claimant (...) has made no effort* *to try to show how the individual breaches described in paragraph 421 would have resulted*  *in Gala Radio (...) winning those tenders (...)\"192*. Claimant, on the other hand, asserted to have pleaded a case of loss of chances: *\"We did put forward a case of loss of opportunities,*  *and we did this at every stage of the proceedings\"*193.\n\nSee HTRI, pp. 269-273.\n\nSee HTRI, pp. 248-249.\n\n**I.B. The Majority Position in the Award**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**I.B.1. Elements of Causation: Cause, Effect, Causal Link**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nAbsent a provision in the BIT on the legal consequences of violations of the FET standard, the Majority relies on general principles on the responsibility of States for international wrongful acts as stated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in *Factory at Chorzow* and reflected in Articles 31, 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The Majority distinguishes three elements of causation - *cause, effect* and logical *link* between cause and effect194\n\nParas. 157- 172 of the Award.\n\n250.\n\nThe para. 421 incidents, including the Interregnum practice, constitute the *cause* as a matter of *res judicata195*\n\nParas. 158- 160 of the Award.\n\n251.\n\nConsonant with Claimant\u2019s submission, the Majority defines the *effect* in terms of the profits lost by Gala due to the practice during the Interregnum. This *lucrum cessans* is equated with *\"the difference in value between Gala which* [Claimant] *actually owns (Gala\u2019s \"as is\" value) and the Gala which he had planned, and which he has not been able to achieve, due to Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts (Gala\u2019s \"but for\" value)\".*\n\n252.\n\nThus, the Majority determines the *effect* on the basis of Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans: *\"(...) the question of Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial business plans becomes decisive\".* Gala\u2019s *\"but for value\"* is defined as Gala\u2019s hypothetical enterprise value if the business expansion plans of 1995 had been realized as assumed by the Majority (and alleged by Claimant), i.e., if Gala had operated a nationwide FM music network as of January 2001 (plus a second AM channel). From *Vr\u00fas\"but for value\",* Gala\u2019s actual *(\"as is\u2019)* enterprise value is deducted. The balance represents Claimant\u2019s loss to be compensated by Respondent196\n\nParas 243, 296, 297 of the Award. Cf. paras. 480 -489 infra on the Majority\u2019s critique in point.\n\n**I.B.2. Causal Link**\n----------------------\n\n***I.B.2.a. Concept*****197**\n-----------------------------\n\nParas. 162-171 of the Award.\n\n253.\n\nNow, the Majority defines the required *causal link* as *\"an uninterrupted and proximate logical chain* [that] *leads from the initial cause (...the wrongful acts of Ukraine) to the final effect (the loss in value of Gala)\".* This logical chain must be proven by Claimant while Respondent can break the chain by showing intervening causes.\n\n254.\n\nThe Majority further distinguishes between *pure* and *transitive* causal links. *Pure* links connect the wrongful act directly with the damage while *transitive* links denote a chain of events leading indirectly from the wrongdoing to the damage. Indirect losses must be compensated as long as they can be traced back to the wrongdoing in terms of *proximity* and *foreseeability.* The latter two notions serve to limit Claimant\u2019s burden of proof. He needs only to show that the wrongdoing featured as a proximate and foreseeable cause of the ultimate loss\n\n255.\n\nAs per the Majority, Claimant needs to establish two successive links, namely that (i) Gala *\"would have won the disputed frequencies if the tenders had hypothetically been decided in a fair and equitable manner, and* [if Gala] *had participated in them\";* and (ii) *\"with these frequencies, Mr. Lemire would have been able to grow Gala Radio into the broadcasting company he had planned: a FM national broadcaster (...).\"*\n\n256.\n\nThese two links need in the Majority\u2019s opinion be shown in terms of probability rather than certainty: *\"(...) it is impossible to establish, with total certainty, how specific tenders* *would have been awarded if the National Council would not have violated the FET Standard. The best that the Tribunal can expect Claimant to prove is that through a line of natural sequences it is probable - and not simple possible - that Gala would have been awarded the frequencies under tender\".*\n\n***I.B.2.b. First Link: From Interregnum to Foregone Frequencies*** *198*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParas. 173 - 202 of the Award.\n\n257.\n\nThe Majority accepts Claimant\u2019s submission that during the Interregnum more than eighty frequencies had been allocated and Gala should have reached nation-wide coverage if it had obtained fourteen of these frequencies. The Majority continues to reason: *\"if these 80 frequencies had been awarded by tender in accordance with the procedure set forth in the LTR,*  ***it is likely***  *that Claimant would have won the 14 licences required to create a national FM network. The Tribunal bases its opinion on the*  ***undisputed***  *fact that at the time of the Interregnum, Gala Radio was one of the most successful radio operators in Kyiv - it held the number 1 and 2 position. If the National Council had proceeded properly to award the new licences, it would have applied the criteria set forth in Article 25.14 of the LTR. Gala was well placed to meet these criteria - being one if the leading operators, it would have received high marks with regard to the first and third criteria* [capability of fulfilling licence conditions and financial/technical strength] - *and as regards the second criterion, Gala was well known to have broadcast socially relevant programs; moreover, as an independent broadcaster, its presence would reinforce freedom of speech\"199.*\n\nPara. 179 of the Award (emphasis provided). See also paras. 189, 190, 207 of the Award.\n\n258.\n\nThe Majority does not, beyond the above summary observations, review the specific circumstances related to frequencies allotted during the Interregnum.\n\n259.\n\nRather, the Majority proceeds with dismissing Respondent\u2019s submission that Gala would not have secured any frequency allocated during the Interregnum even if such frequencies had been put up for tender in accordance with the LTR200.\n\nParas. 180-191 of the Award.\n\n260.\n\nUpon the above-outlined analysis, the Majority concludes *\"that under the hypothesis that Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts (the practice of awarding radio licences while the National Council was not operative and the tender of January 1, 2001, to legalise the licences) had not occurred, and that the 80 licences had been correctly assigned in compliance with* *Ukrainian legislation, Gala Radio should have received, no later than January 1, 2001 at least the 14 frequencies required to operate a nationwide FM music network\"201.*\n\nPara. 191 of the Award.\n\n***I.B.2.c. Second Link: From Frequencies to Full National Network***202\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParas. 203 - 208 of the Award.\n\n261.\n\nThe Majority proceeds to state that Claimant would have realized his initial business expansion plans had he obtained the aforementioned 14 frequencies. This leads it to the conclusion *\"that Claimant has been able to prove that the initial cause (Claimant\u2019s frustration to fulfil his plans and operate a nationwide FM channel (...) are linked through a chain of causation\"203.*\n\nPara. 208 of the Award.\n\n262.\n\nRespondent had submitted that Claimant had not mustered the necessary financial resources and technical know-how to build and operate a nationwide FM network. Imposing the burden of proof on Respondent, the Majority considers Gala as adequately financed owing to contributions from Claimant\u2019s personal wealth. The Majority further notes that *\"Respondent has not been able to prove that Gala Radio\u2019s competitors did not present the same shortcomings\".*\n\n**I.C. My View**\n----------------\n\n263.\n\nIn my view, the Majority construes causation principles in relation to tenders unprecedented in international law and in sharp contrast to municipal laws in point (I.C.1. infra). The Majority\u2019s conclusions represent a *\"surprise decision\"* violating Respondent\u2019s Right to be Heard (I.C.2. Infra).\n\n**I.C.1. The Majority\u2019s Causation Principles**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s introductory statements regarding State responsibility in the abstract. I also agree in the abstract with the Majority\u2019s basic distinction of *cause, effect* and *causal link* and the latter\u2019s division into *pure* and *transitive* links. I disagree, however, with the Majority\u2019s application of these notions to public tenders in general and the facts at hand in particular.\n\n***I.C.1.a. Cause Not Defined as Composite Act***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Majority portrays Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing during the Interregnum as an *\"irregular practice\"* without referring to particular actions. This associates the practice with a *\"Composite Act\"* as defined in article 15 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Yet, the Majority stops short of classifying the Interregnum Practice as a *\"composite act\",* for good reasons.\n\n266.\n\nA *\"composite* act\" denotes *\"a violation* [of international law] *separate from the individual violations (...) of which it is composed\".* A practice of repeated breaches of an international obligation *\"does not of itself constitute a violation separate from such breaches \"204* Only a *\"systematic policy or practice\",* as such constituting a violation of international law, may qualify as *\"composite act*205. The Majority does not find such a systematic policy or practice206.\n\nILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 15, note 5 with reference to *Ireland v. the United Kingdom, Eur. Court H.R., Series A, No. 25,* p. 64 (1978).\n\nILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 15, note 3.\n\nClaimant had Indeed alleged such a practice, Insinuating an understanding among authorities concerned to deny all applications of Gala for additional frequencies: *\"Respondent has refused to grant any new frequencies to Gala (...)\" and \"Respondent has blocked Gala\u2019s development of a second national framework\"* (Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 106). However, Claimant has failed to substantiate, let alone, prove his Insinuation.  \n The Majority also stops short of explicitly construing a violation of the FET standard through frustration of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations related to business expansion.\n\n267.\n\nAbsent a *\"composite act\",* solely individual allocations of frequencies to Gala\u2019s competitors during the Interregnum could possibly breach Claimant\u2019s rights under the FET standard - not the administrative practice as such.\n\n***I. C. 1.b. Effect Defined as Frustration of Business Expansion Plans***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Majority identifies *\"Claimant\u2019s frustration to fulfil his plans and operate a nationwide FM channel\"* as *\"the final effect\" of* Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing207. And it computes Claimant\u2019s foregone profits on the basis of these business expansion plans (What would Gala\u2019s value have been if these plans had been realized?). The assumed effect, however, does not relate to individual allocations of frequencies during the Interregnum. It rather refers to the administrative practice during the Interregnum as if it had been defined in aggregate as a *composite act.*\n\nPara. 208 of the Award.\n\n269.\n\nThe Majority moreover defines the *\"effect\"* in terms of Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans previously related to his assumed legitimate expectations208. My objections to the consideration of Claimant\u2019s pertinent business plans in this arbitration209 therefore extend to linking the definition of the *effect* with these plans.\n\nParas 268 -270 of the First Decision.\n\nParas. 32, 33 supra.\n\n***I.C.1.c. Causal Links***\n---------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Majority distinguishes between two *\"causal links\" -* (i) the link between Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing (the allocation of frequencies out of tender) and the (hypothetical) award of frequencies to Gala if they had been put to tender; and (ii) the link between the hypothetical award of frequencies to Gala and the realization of Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans.\n\n271.\n\nI agree with the distinction between two *causal links.* However, this distinction logically implies two *effects -* the award of frequencies to Gala and the realization of Claimant\u2019s business plans. The existence of two successive *effects* and *causal links* breaks the *\"transitive causation chain\"* construed by the Majority; and it represents a special phenomenon in case of flawed or averted public tenders.\n\n272.\n\nI have not detected any precedent in international investment arbitration applying the FET standard to public tenders or otherwise addressing the causation issue in public210 tenders. Absent an established rule of international law in point, *\"the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\"* must be taken into account211. These are reflected in municipal laws in point. European and German law provide examples.\n\nCf. Overview of loss of chance - cases in Irmgard Marboe, *\"Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law\"* *.* Oxford University Press, 2009, paras. 3,219 - 3,225.\n\nArticle 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n273.\n\nSubsequently, European and German laws in point are outlined (i) and vetted against pertinent international law principles (ii). The Majority\u2019s analysis of the two *causal links* is then reviewed in light of European/German law in consonance with international law principles (iii, iv).\n\nI.C.1.c.i. Recovery of Loss in Tenders under European and German Law\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I.C.1.c.i.(a) European Law*\n----------------------------\n\n274.\n\nIn European law, the issue is addressed in article 2(7) of the*\"Sector Surveillance Directive\".* It provides: *\"Where a claim is made for damages representing the costs of preparing a bid or of participating in an award procedure, the person making the claim shall be required only to prove an infringement of Community law in the field of procurement or national rules implementing that law and that he would have had a real chance of winning the contract and that, as a consequence of that infringement, that chance was adversely affected\"212.*\n\nCouncil Directive 92/13EEC of 25. Febr.1992, Official Journal L 076, 23/03/1992, p. 14-20\n\n275.\n\nThe *Directive* bestows a right of recovery to bidders that have lost out in legally flawed tenders on two conditions, namely (i) actual participation in or preparation for a particular tender and (ii) proof of a *\"real chance\"* of success in that tender. Most importantly, the *Directive* provides only for recovery of the costs incurred in relation to the tender concerned *(damnum emergens)-,* it does **not** extend to profits foregone due to losing the award *(lucrum cessans).*\n\n276.\n\nUnder European Union, Claimant\u2019s claim would thus have to be dismissed on (at least) three grounds, namely:\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s failure of having participated in tenders during the Interregnum213;\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s failure of having proven a *\"real chance\"* in particular tenders214; and\n\n\u25a0 The limitation of any recovery to *damnum emergens.*\n\nEuropean law does not envisage any recovery rights of companies prevented from bidding in a tender which has not been organized although required by law.\n\nSee paras. 298 - 303 infra.\n\n277.\n\nPursuant to Article 288(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, all *Directives* must be transformed by EU Member States into their municipal laws. The *Directive* therefore reflects the law common to all twenty-seven EU Member States.\n\n278.\n\nThe *Directive* sets a minimum standard regarding the protection of bidders in flawed tenders which must be observed by all EU Member States. It provides a protection standard on the European plane similar to the FET standard on the international plane. As the European standard addresses the tender situation particular to this arbitration, it merits consideration in concretizing the more general FET standard and international law principles complementing the standard.\n\n*I.C.1.c.i.(b) German law*\n--------------------------\n\n279.\n\nGerman law offers an example of EU Member State laws that have transformed the *Directive* and exceed the latter\u2019s protection level by envisaging award of lost profits in certain circumstances.\n\n280.\n\nPatterned after the Directive, para. 126 of the 2009 *Law Against Restraints of Competition (\"Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen\")* provides a cause of action for damages suffered by tender participants as a result of a violation of tender rules, provided that (i) the rule violated aims at protecting the claimant concerned; and the claimant proves a *\"real chance\"* to win the tender but for the violation215\n\nClaimant must substantiate and prove this \"real chance\" (See L\u00f6wenheim-Meessen-Riesenkampff, *\"Kommentar zum Europ\u00e4ischen und Deutschen Kartell recht\",2nd* ed., 2009,para. 126 GWB, comments by Marc Bungenberg, note 5).\n\n281.\n\nAs the *Directive,* the German remedy limits any compensation to *\"the expenses incurred in preparing the tender offer or participating in the tender\",* i.e., to the *damnum emergens.* Profits foregone as a result of winning the award *(lucrum cessans) can* be recovered only if and to the extent that provided by general remedies of German law.\n\n282.\n\nSuch general remedies are anchored in paras. 311(2) and 839 of the German Civil Code in conjunction with Article 34 of the German Basic Law *(culpa in contrahendo* and *misuse of office by public officials,* respectively). As a rule, both remedies are limited to recovery of the *damnum emergens (\"negatives Interesse\u2019)216.*\n\nSee Palandt-Gr\u00fcneberg, *Commentary on the Civil Code,* 68th ed., 2009, para. 311, notes 36, 37..\n\n283.\n\nNevertheless, German courts have awarded *lucrum cessans* where a claimant proves that *\"he*  ***would***  *have won the award if the tender had been carried out in due process\"* (emphasis provided)217. Yet, German courts require more than showing of a probability or a preponderance of evidence in this context. Claimant must prove that the authority in charge had no other lawful choice but to award the contract to claimant. In other words, lost profits cannot be recovered as long as the award to a contender of the claimant can possibly be justified as an exercise of the authority\u2019s discretion in accordance with applicable legislation218,219.\n\nGerman Federal Supreme Court (BGHZ), vol. 120, p. 281 (Nov. 25, 1992).\n\nSee German Federal Supreme Court, supra, p. 285 where the Court emphasises that Claimant had met all requirements while his only two competitors had to be excluded as a matter of law. Cf. also *obiter dictum in* Federal Supreme Court, vol. 139, p. 272 (Sept. 8, 1998) : *\"(...) recovery of lost profits only (...) where the contract has been awarded and the losing contender would have received it\"* [as a matter of certainty if the law had been complied with]. And the Court of Appeals of Brandenburg dismissed a claim for lost profits on the ground that *\"the violations offender rules have not been causal for the alleged loss of profits, because the plaintiff did not have to obtain the award if the tender rules had been complied with\"* (Brandenburglsches Oberlandesgerlcht, dec. January 10, 2007, 4 U 81/06, p. 8).  \n The mentioned decisions are based on *culpa in contrahendo.* However, similar limitations apply to claims on account of misuse of office. In principle limited to *damnum emergens,* such claims may in exceptional cases extend to *lucrum cessans* where the violation has frustrated conclusion of the contract and claimant proves with *\"a probability bordering at certainty\"* that the contract would have been concluded but for the violation.This jurisprudence follows the principle of German law that the *\"negative Interesse\"* is normally confined to *\"damnum emergens\",* but that It may extend to *\"lucrum cessans\"* in exceptional cases where the violation has frustrated conclusion of a contract and claimant proves with a probability bordering at certainty that the contract would have been concluded but for the violation (see Palandt-Helnrlchs, fn. 216, Introductory note 17 on para. 249 and Palandt-Sprau, para. 839, note 77).\n\nRecovery of lost profits is under German law subject to further restrictions which would require dismissal of Claimant\u2019s claim. Notably, all claims under *culpa in contrahendo* become statute-barred within 3 years (paras. 280, 311(2), 195 of the German Civil Code); and claims for *misuse of office* are precluded if no remedy was sought against the misconduct in due time and due course (para. 839(3) of the German Civil Code). The Interregnum had ended in June 2000; and Claimant has filed his request for arbitration on September 6, 2006.\n\n*I.C.1.c.i.(c) Rationale of Limiting Recovery of Lost Profits in Tenders*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe limitation in municipal laws of recovery of lost profits due to flawed tenders ensues from a particular feature of public tenders - the inherent possibility that claims of unsuccessful bidders may accumulate to incalculable *\"liability avalanches\".* This possibility derives from the typical situation where multiple bidders apply but only one can win. Theoretically, the chances of all bidders together cannot add up to more than hundred percent. However, if chances of individual claimants are determined without weighing them against the chances of contenders, several claims can in the aggregate easily exceed the value of the award. The more liberally chances are estimated, the greater is the potential of claims accumulating to excessive amounts. According all \"losers\" in such situations remedies to sue themselves into financial winners by claiming lost profits would expose States to incalculable fiscal risks.\n\n285.\n\nThe limits to State liability for violations of tender rules outlined under German law as an example serve an obvious purpose, i.e., to protect the State against \"avalanches\" of claims from multiple frustrated tender participants.\n\n286.\n\nThis liability scenario fundamentally distinguishes the situation of tenders from the bankruptcy scenario referred to by the Majority to illustrate its theory of *\"transitive causal links220*. In the bankruptcy scenario no multiple potential claimants (i.e., bankrupted companies) and resultant liability avalanches exist.\n\nParas. 165, 167 of the Award.\n\n287.\n\nThe outlined EU and German law relate to public procurement whereas the case at hand concerns the allocation of radio frequencies. This difference is immaterial, though. The dynamics of competitive public tenders with the ensuing liability scenario are the same, irrespective of the context in which the tender is held.\n\n288.\n\nIn brief, European and German laws, for recovery of loss in case of flawed tenders require proof of:\n\n\u25a0 A violation of applicable law in a particular tender in which the claimant has either participated or was prevented from participating by the violation; and\n\n\u25a0 A \"real chance\" of the claimant in the particular tender concerned but for the violation.\n\n289.\n\nRecovery of profits lost due to flawed tenders is not foreseen in EU law at all. German law provides for this possibility but only where the claimant proves that he would have won the tender concerned but for the violation. This proof requires evidence of a degree of probability bordering at certainty.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the causation chain required for recovery of lost profits under German law:\n\nI.C.1.c.ii. Consistency of European and German Law with International Law\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nEuropean and German laws in point in my view conform to relevant principlesof international law, notably the bias against awarding *\"speculative profits\" and* the requirement of *\"particularizing\"* damages.\n\n*I.C.1.c.ii.(a) Speculative Profits*\n------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Majority *\"agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty221.*\n\nPara. 246 of the Award.\n\n292.\n\nThe outcome of public tenders with myriad competitors is inherently speculative. The EU *Directive* excluding loss of profits in case of flawed tender is therefore consistent with the bias against speculative profits under international law. And the approach of German law requiring in such cases a level of probability bordering at certainty directly squares with the international rule in point. Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility extends compensation to loss of profits only *\"insofar as it is established.*\n\n*I.C.1.c.ii.(b)GAMI case*\n-------------------------\n\n293.\n\nUnder international law, recoverable damages need to be *\"particularized\".* This principle was developed in the *GAMI* case222\n\n*GAMI Investments, Inc. v. Mexico,*Ad hoc Arbitration UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Final Award of November 15, 2004.\n\n294.\n\nIn that case, the claimant had proven maladministration of Mexico\u2019s sugar regime and some loss to its investment as a result. Nevertheless, the Tribunal dismissed *GAMI\u2019s* claim under Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA (FET standard) on the ground that the claimant had failed to *\"particularize\"* its damage: *\"GAMI can assert only that the maladministration of the Sugar Program caused it some prejudice.*  ***But the prejudice must be particularized and quantified......*** *the Tribunal would have been in no position to award damages even if it had found a violation of Article 1105\"* (emphasis provided)223\n\n*GAMI,* fn. 222, para. 85.\n\n295.\n\nApplied to tender situations, *particularization* requires identification of the particular tenders on account of which recovery is sought. This conforms to the requirement under European and German laws to prove claimant\u2019s prospects to win with respect to particular tenders.\n\nI.C.1.c.iii. First *Causal Link*224\n-----------------------------------\n\nSee paras. 173 - 202 of the Award.\n\n296.\n\nThe first *causal link* concerns the nexus between the unlawful out-of-tender allocation of frequencies to competitors and Gala\u2019s failure to obtain frequencies thus allotted. The Majority does not identify particular frequencies that Gala would have obtained but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing. It just accepts Claimant\u2019s summary allegation that Gala would have won 14 additional frequencies needed to operate a nationwide network. This approach in my view misconstrues applicable principles, inadmissibly shifts the burden of proof and entails factual errors.\n\n297.\n\nThe Majority tries to explain its approach by distinguishing the scenario at hand from a *\"loss of chance\"-* scenario: *\"The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is not that Gala Radio was relegated in certain specific tenders for frequencies, and was deprived of a chance to win in these procedures; what the Tribunal has found is that the initial cause (Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts) and the damage (Claimant\u2019s frustration to carry out his plans and create a nationwide FM channel (...) are linked through a proximate chain of causation. The investor\u2019s loss does not consist in being deprived of some chance to win additional frequencies; what has been proven is that Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts have resulted, through a foreseeable and proximate* *chain of events, in the damage suffered by the investor\"225.*\n\nPara. 252 of the Award.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii. (a) Particularization*\n------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nClaimant has failed to substantiate Gala\u2019s prospects with respect to particular frequencies allotted during the Interregnum if these had been put up for tender in accordance with the LTR. The Majority apparently tries to overcome this failure by considering as *\"cause\"* the occurrences during the Interregnum in the aggregate and construing the causation chain from such aggregate rather than the individual allocations of frequencies constituting the practice. This approach, however, would assume existence of a *\"composite act\"* within the meaning of Article 15 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility; and it is inconsistent with municipal laws on recovery of loss in tender situations as well of international law precedents in line with these municipal laws.\n\n299.\n\nThe Majority does not qualify the occurrences during the Interregnum as a *\"composite act\" (para.* 265 - 267 supra). Thus, each diversion of a frequency sought by Claimant from the tender process during the Interregnum severally constitutes an assumed breach of the FET standard. The effects must be related to each such breach severally; they must be determined frequency-by-frequency on the basis of an assessment of Gala\u2019s prospects in each (hypothetical) tender of which Gala was allegedly deprived226.\n\n1 do not wish to speculate whether a causation chain could be construed on the basis of a whole-sale assessment of the Interregnum practice in the aggregate if the latter were considered as a *\"composite act\".* Suffice to note that the Majority neither has not done so and nor could have done so in view of the *res judicata* effect of the First Decision.\n\n300.\n\nEuropean and German laws admittedly only concern cases where tenders are held but violate applicable law. They do not directly address the present scenario where tenders prescribed by law are evaded and potential applicants thus deprived of their chances. However, the rationale of limiting recovery in tender situations - and especially recovery of lost profits - applies a *fortiori* to the scenario at hand. If liberal recovery of loss were allowed in the present scenario, practically all operators in the business related to evaded tenders could sue for loss of profits; and the *\"liability avalanches\"* germane to tenders could encompass all market participants rather than just the participants in particular tenders.\n\n301.\n\nA tender-by-tender assessment would have to take into account the specifics of each situation. According to Claimant\u2019s expert witness, chances of success in tenders were primarily determined by the added value of the proposed program to the diversity of the radio market as well as applicant\u2019s technical/professional capabilities in relation to the proposed program227. Gala\u2019s competitive strength had thus to be assessed with a view to the particular program and market conditions of individual (hypothesized) tenders as well as the competitive strength of contenders likely to have participated in such tenders. And Respondent\u2019s principal arguments (priority of previous licence holders, Gala\u2019s existing presence in the region) would have to be analyzed in each instance.\n\nSee Andre Wiegand, HT, 1st day, para. 183 at p. 142 and para. 116 supra.\n\n302.\n\nRather than conducting such assessments, the Majority\u2019s offers just some summary observations: Gala in 1999 was *\"one of the most successful radio operators in Kyiv\",* Claimant and his staff made impressive presentations to the Tribunal regarding Gala\u2019s program and technology228. From these observations, the Majority concludes that *\"Gala Radio should have received, no later than January 1, 2001, at least the 14 licences required to create a national FM network\"* if the 80 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum had been put to tender229.\n\nParas 189, 190 of the Award. See paras. 312 - 328 infra on the accuracy of these observations.\n\nPara. 191 of the Award. Cf. also paras. 179, 201 of the Award and 253 - 256 supra.\n\n303.\n\nThis cursory summary assessment cannot substitute for the case-by-case determinations required for awarding loss of profits in tenders. Indeed, the Tribunal was procedurally unable to make the required determinations, because Claimant had only submitted that sufficient frequencies had been available which **could** (rather than would) have been allocated to Gala. He had not substantiated Gala\u2019s prospects in any hypothetical tender, let alone offered proof230.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 32 - 37 and HTRI p. 20 - 24.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii. (a)* Burden *of Proof*\n------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Majority notes that causation must be established with a higher *\"level of certainty\"* than the amount of damages231. However, such level of certainty is deemed to be established by proof *\"that through a line of natural sequences it is probable - and not simply possible - that Gala would have been awarded the frequencies under the tender*232*.*\n\nPara. 246 of the Award.\n\nPara. 169 of the Award.\n\n305.\n\nRespondent has submitted that Gala would not have obtained any of the frequencies allotted during the Interregnum even if they had been put up for tender in accordance with the LTR233. The Majority dismisses this submission, notably the argument that\n\n\u25a0 Gala never planned to apply for Interregnum frequencies by assuming that Gala would have applied if tenders had been announced;\n\n\u25a0 Claimant has waived his rights due to the Interregnum by denying such waiver234;\n\n\u25a0 Gala would not have obtained frequencies in locations for which it already held frequencies by opining that Gala broadcasted in Kyiv only and its frequencies in eleven other cities *\"had very low power\";*\n\n\u25a0 Broadcasters previously holding frequencies had priority to their reallocation by finding that this argument affected only 31 frequencies;\n\n\u25a0 Gala was inadequately funded by referring to Claimant\u2019s off-record contributions to Gala and noting that *\"Respondent has not been able to prove that Gala Radio\u2019s competitors did not present the same shortcomings and thus were not better qualified in this respect\"',* and\n\n\u25a0 Gala was not competitive by referring to statements of Claimant and his witnesses during the first phase of the proceedings235.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 160 \u2013 188.\n\nThis issue relates to the question whether the Interregnum practice could establish Respondent\u2019s liability towards Claimant in principle and is commented on in this context. See paras. 200 \u2013 204 supra and paras. 499 \u2013 505 infra.\n\nThis issue relates to the question whether the Interregnum practice could establish Respondent\u2019s liability towards Claimant in principle and is commented on in this context. See paras. 200 \u2013 204 supra and paras. 499 \u2013 505 infra.\n\n306.\n\nTo dismiss Respondent\u2019s arguments as outlined, the Majority shifts the burden of proving the underlying facts on Respondent. This in my view is procedurally incorrect.\n\n307.\n\nAs explained before, Claimant had the burden of proving Gala\u2019s prospects of winning frequencies allotted during the Interregnum. This included proof by Claimant of the facts underlying Respondent\u2019s submission on a frequency-by-frequency basis. Respondent\u2019s objections could therefore not be dismissed on the ground of insufficient evidence provided by Respondent236.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras 131 - 157 with references.\n\n308.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s assessment can thus on procedural grounds not sustain the conclusion that Gala would have obtained the requisite frequencies for a nationwide FM network but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing.\n\n309.\n\nThe procedural insufficiency of the Majority\u2019s assessment becomes even more striking if it is assumed in accordance with German law that recovery of lost profits in tender situations is contingent on proof of a probability bordering at certainty that the claimant would have won the tender if rules had been complied with. Such proof appears to be difficult in the scenario at hand where Claimant\u2019s prospects in a series of hypothetical tenders with unknown tender conditions and unknown competitors (potentially all broadcasters operative in Ukraine during the period of the Interregnum) must be assessed.\n\n310.\n\nProviding a hurdle to recovery, though, does not necessarily disqualify German law from providing guidance in the interpretation of international law. As shown before, European law does not at all envision recovery of lost profits due to flawed tenders; and precedents under international law militate against awarding speculative profits. In the present inherently highly speculative scenario, the award of lost profits is in my view inadmissable.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii. (b) Key findings*\n-------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nFurther to my objections to the procedural adequacy of the Majority\u2019s assessment, I should note that at least some key findings are doubtful at least.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii.(b).(i)*  *Gala\u2019s market position*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Majority *\"bases its opinion on the*  ***undisputed***  *fact that at the time of the* *Interregnum, Gala Radio was one of the most successful radio operators in Kyiv - it held number 1 and 2 position\"* (emphasis added)237. Repeated several times throughout the Award, this finding is apparently pivotal to the Majority\u2019s conclusions238. However, It is misleading at best.\n\nPara. 179 of the Award.\n\nSee paras. 179, 189, 190, 207 of the Award.\n\n313.\n\nAs evidence that its finding is undisputed, the Majority refers to statements of Respondent\u2019s Counsel during the Hearing on Remaining Issues239. However, the reference corresponds to Counsel\u2019s explanation that Gala\u2019s market position in Kyiv had only Initially been strong *\"when there were no competitors\".* After 1999, this position eroded quickly and consistently down to rank 15 in 2010240. Gala, from 1995 to present, has held a strong frequency which covered the entire territory of Kyiv. Unlike assumed by the Majority (fn. 176 of the Award), the erosion of Gala\u2019s market share in Kyiv can logically not be attributed to a denial of frequencies - Gala has had the requisite frequency at its disposal. In Respondent Counsel\u2019s explanation, Gala\u2019s loss of market share is due to its unattractive music program.\n\nSee fn. 176 of the Award with reference to HTRI, p. 65.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s power point presentation at HRI, p. 25 (facts undisputed). The erosion of Gala\u2019s market share in Kyiv is confirmed by Claimant\u2019s expert report, showing a drop of Gala\u2019s audience in Kyiv from 270,000 in 2003 to 104,000 in 2008. See Goldmedia Supplementary Report, 2010, Exhibit 21 at p. 30.  \n See further findings of the \"Brand Support Report Gala\", a consultancy study commissioned by Claimant and attached to his expert consultant\u2019s \"Goldmedia Report\". According to the Brand Support Report, Gala in 2007 ranked no. 7 in total and no. 10 in terms of most favorite music station in the areas in which Gala did broadcast.\n\n314.\n\nThus, although Gala\u2019s historic market position in Kyiv in 1999 was not disputed as such, the sustainability of this position was. And subsequent development has confirmed this weakness. This discredits the Majority\u2019s reliance on Gala\u2019s overall competitive strength as principal evidence of its assumed success in (hypothetical) tenders during the Interregnum241\n\nSuch reliance moreover appears to be inconsistent with the Majority\u2019s conclusions in the First Decision. There, the Majority has found that Gala\u2019s failure to obtain any but one frequency on more than 200 applications between 2001 and 2007 *\"cannot provide conclusive evidence that Respondent has violated the FET standard\"* (para. 330 of the First Decision). The Majority further noted that these statistics, in conjunction with three other factors, *\"can be construed as*  ***indications***  *that at least some of the decisions of the National Council when it awarded frequencies were arbitrary and/or discriminatory\"* (para. 420 of the First Decision). Gala\u2019s market position in Kyiv was not mentioned as one of the Indicators.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii.(b).(ii)*  *Frequencies in locations covered by Gala\u2019s frequencies*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Majority dismisses Respondent\u2019s argument that many of the frequencies allotted during the Interregnum concerned locations covered by Gala\u2019s 13 frequencies finding that *\"Gala Radio was only transmitting in Kyiv, and the frequencies it then obtained in 11 cities* *had very low power*242. This finding is inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s pleading and the Majority\u2019s reasoning in the First Decision; it is also flawed in substance.\n\nPara. 187 of the Award.\n\n316.\n\nClaimant, in his Memorial on Remaining Issues, had identified 32 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum which concerned locations not covered by Gala\u2019s 13 frequencies. And he had submitted that *\"a fraction of these 32 frequencies would have enabled Claimant to achieve a full national network as of January 1, 2001\"*243*.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, para. 37 and Fn. 64.\n\n317.\n\nIn the Hearing on Remaining Issues, Claimant\u2019s Counsel started his explanations on frequencies available for Gala with reference to *\"38 frequencies that could have been complementary to its* [Gala\u2019s] *network*244*.* Claimant had thus accepted Respondent\u2019s position that out of some 80 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum only 38 for locations not covered by Gala\u2019s frequencies merited further consideration. The Majority disregards a limitation agreed between the Parties.\n\nHTRI, p. 18  \n While Claimant, in para. 37 of his MRI, had referred only to 32 frequencies, he had Identified 38 frequencies in Ffn. 64. Respondent has accepted the reference to 38 frequencies (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 176, 177 and HTRI, p. 48; and Claimant has based its subsequent position on this figure.\n\n318.\n\nUnlike in the Award, the Majority in the First Decision found that *the power of the frequencies awarded to Claimant was not abnormally low (...)* [but] *matched that of frequencies allocated to major competitors*245. Moreover, the power of these frequencies ranged widely from 0.1 to 4 kW246. Thus, a need for an additional frequency to cover a certain location could only be determined on a case-by-case basis rather than be assumed across the board.\n\nPara. 197 of the First Decision.\n\nPara. 194 of the First Decision.\n\n319.\n\nFinding that Gala, at the time of the Interregnum, broadcasted only in Kyiv, the Majority overlooks the fact that Claimant at the very same time was negotiating for frequencies in additional 11 cities. There is no indication that Claimant would have applied for overlapping frequencies if they had been put to tender. Such applications could have interfered with his negotiations of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii.(b).(iii)*  *Priority of previous licence holders*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Majority dismisses Respondent\u2019s argument that most frequencies allotted during the Interregnum were encumbered with priority rights of previous licence holders finding that this argument affected only 31 frequencies out of which 20 could have been awarded to Gala247. This finding is inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s pleading in point relied on by the Majority.\n\nPara. 186, 187 of the Award. Cf. also para. 109 of the Award and paras. 526 - 529 Infra.\n\n321.\n\nClaimant had related the 31 frequencies with priority rights only to the aforementioned 38 frequencies in locations not covered by Gala rather than the some 80 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum in total. This left only seven frequencies without priority rights attached248.\n\nHTRI, p. 20: *\"The argument is that 31 of those 38 frequencies that we had identified were under what is called a \"priority procedure (...) That leaves seven which had no priority rights (...)\"*\n\n322.\n\nClaimant had further argued that in six of the 38 instances, frequencies had been allotted to broadcasters other than the previous licence holders, and in seven instances previous licence holders had forfeited their priority rights because of legal violations249. With these - contested250 - arguments, Claimant tried to increase the number of available frequencies from seven to twenty.\n\nHTRI, p. 23.\n\nHTRI, p. 49.\n\n323.\n\nRespondent\u2019s had submitted the following facts: Out of the seven frequencies unencumbered with priority rights, two concerned locations for which Gala had obtained frequencies under the Settlement Agreement and two were for the same city. The remaining four frequencies were formally awarded by the National Council in tenders on March 22 and June 21, 2001 (rather than the January 1, 2001 tender). In these two tenders, Gala did participate but did not apply for any of the frequencies in question (what it could have done)251. Claimant had not contested these facts. The Majority ignores them nevertheless.\n\nHTRI, p. 50, 51 and Third WS Kurus, para. 20.\n\n324.\n\nThus, according to the common submission of the Parties a total between nil (Respondent) and twenty (Claimant) frequencies allotted during the Interregnum had been available for possible award to Gala. The Majority concludes that *\"Gala Radio should have* *received....at least the 14 frequencies required to operate a nationwide FM music network252.*\n\nParas. 191,201,202 of the Award.\n\n325.\n\nThe availability of up to twenty frequencies does not imply an entitlement to them on the part of Claimant/Gala. Rather, Claimant would have had to establish the required probability (under German law bordering at certainty) that Gala would have won the frequencies had they been put up for tender. In the Majority\u2019s conclusion, Claimant has proven that Gala would have won at least 14 frequencies (out of 20 available at most)253. This seventy percent success record is assumed despite Claimant\u2019s failure to substantiate Gala\u2019s prospects in any hypothetical tenders.\n\nPara. 202 of the Award.\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii.(b).(iv)*  *Applications of Gala*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Majority discards as irrelevant the fact that Gala has never (prior to the First Decision) expressed an interest in frequencies allotted during the Interregnum, opining that Gala would have done so had the frequencies been duly put up for tender254. At the same time, the Majority accepts Claimant\u2019s submission that he sought these frequencies to supplement the low powered frequencies obtained under the Settlement Agreement255\n\nParas. 181, 182 of the Award.\n\nParas. 174- 177 of the Award.\n\n327.\n\nCo-terminus with the Interregnum, however, Claimant had been negotiating for priority allocation of frequencies as per the Settlement Agreement. He had expected higher powered frequencies facilitating his business expansion plans256. Even if additional frequencies had been put up for tender at that time, Claimant would thus have not seen a business reason to apply for them.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post Hearing Memorial, para. 57.12\n\n*I.C.1.c.iii.(b).(v)*  *Gala\u2019s financial resources*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Majority assumes that Gala had adequate resources at its disposal owing to Claimant\u2019s off-record contributions from his personal wealth257. However, the National Council could determine Gala\u2019s financial strength only on the basis of the records submitted to it. Gala\u2019s recorded rather than its actual resources were decisive to its prospects of winning tenders. With a recorded equity of some USD 22,000 and a total investment of USD 141,000, Gala clearly did not exhibit the financial capacity needed to create and operate a nationwide network258.\n\nPara. 206 of the Award.\n\nSee paras. 169- 172 supra.\n\nI.C.1.c.iv. Second Causal Link\n------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nIn the context of a conventional claim for recovery of lost profits, the second link would be defined in terms of the nexus between the assumed award of 14 additional frequencies and the profits anticipated to have flown from such 14 frequencies as the second and final effect259. Yet the Majority links the assumed award to Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans: *\"would Mr. Lemire have been able to develop Gala into the successful broadcasting company he had planned, a FM national broadcaster, for music format (...) 7\"260.*\n\nSee Figure 1 in para. 289 supra.\n\nPara. 203 of the Award.\n\n330.\n\nAs stated, the second link (and effect) overlaps with the first. As explained before, Gala qualified for winning frequencies only if it demonstrated the *\"financial, economic, technical* *capacity\"* to broadcast on the frequencies concerned in accordance with the applicable tender conditions261. The Majority\u2019s conclusion that Gala should have been awarded the frequencies needed for a nationwide network thus implies an assumption that Gala disposed of the capacity to build and operate such network once it obtained the frequencies for it.\n\nSee especially para. 171 supra with reference to Article 30(2)(d) of the LTR.\n\n331.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s consistent emphasis on Claimant\u2019s business plans implies yet another problem. It leads to determining the scope of Respondent\u2019s liability with a view to Claimant\u2019s business plans. Claimant defines and largely controls his business plans. Relying on these plans, the Majority empowers Claimant to influence parameters determining the scope of Respondent\u2019s liability by stating his business plans. Thus, the Majority could, with the reasoning offered, have awarded Claimant an entitlement to any number of Interregnum frequencies between 1 and 20, depending on Claimant\u2019s submission regarding his business plans.\n\n332.\n\nThis aspect is especially disquieting against the background that Claimant has never produced any business plan or other record documenting his business plans at a certain point in time.\n\n333.\n\nMoreover, the notion of a \"nationwide network\" underlying the Majority\u2019s assumptions is subject to several definitions. The term *\"national broadcasting\"* is defined in the LTR. Under the initial definition (programs in *\"over more than half of oblasts of Ukraine\")* only the Ukrainian State Radio Company was a national broadcaster. In 2006, the definition was changed and Gala became registered as a *\"national broadcaster\",* together with 14 other broadcasters in Ukraine (out of 538 in total)262.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 325 - 328 with references - undisputed.\n\n334.\n\nThe notion of a \"nationwide network\" covering Ukraine in its entirety was first introduced by Claimant in this arbitration. Such a network is nowhere mentioned in Claimant\u2019s 1995 correspondence with National Council relied on by the Majority as evidence of Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans263.\n\nPara. 47 supra. In his first witness statement, Claimant still explained that his initial expectations concerned a *\"regional network\"* (WS Lemire, para. 44).\n\n335.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s emphasis on business plans defined by Claimant ad hoc for the purpose of this arbitration reinforces the risk of awarding *\"speculative profits*264*.*\n\nSee further paras. 369 - 380 and 483 - 490 infra.\n\n**I.C.2. Determination of Causation as \"Surprise Decision\"*****(\"Audiatur et Altera Pars\")***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Majority has introduced the out-of-tender allocations of frequencies during the Interregnum as violations of the FET standard without basis in Claimant\u2019s pleadings. This represented a first \"surprise decision\" depriving Respondent of its \"Right to be Heard\"265. Now, the Majority construes the effect of these allocations on Claimant with sweeping references to submissions in the first phase of the proceedings -again as a surprise with prejudice to Respondent.\n\nSee paras. 191-199 supra.  \n In addition, Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans were excluded from consideration in this arbitration by dint of the Settlement Agreement (paras. 200 - 204 supra).\n\n337.\n\nThe Parties, and Respondent in particular, could legitimately expect that the incidents during the Interregnum would be assessed in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the First Decision and its subsequent guidance.\n\n338.\n\nIn the First Decision (para. 418), the Majority has branded the practice during the Interregnum as *\"arbitrary\", \"because it facilitates the secret awarding of licences, without transparency, with total disregard of the process of law* The process of law was the tender process prescribed by the LTR. Its disregard in the Majority\u2019s determination violated the FET standard, because it deprived Gala of its assumed right to apply in tenders evaded.\n\n339.\n\nAccordingly, Claimant\u2019s prejudice would have to be determined in terms of Gala\u2019s frustrated chances of winning additional frequencies in such tenders. The Parties could expect the Tribunal to assess in the Second Phase of the proceedings Gala\u2019s prospects in (hypothetically assumed) tenders that would have been held if the law had been followed.\n\n340.\n\nIn its guidance to the Parties during the Second Phase, the Tribunal confirmed Respondent\u2019s position that the causal connection between Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard and Claimant\u2019s loss had not been pre-determined by the First Decision but was reserved to the Second Phase266. This guidance reinforced Respondent\u2019s legitimate expectation that prospects would be assessed during the Second Phase on a (hypothetical) tender-by-tender assessment in light of new submissions.\n\nSee paras. 239 - 248 supra.\n\n341.\n\nThe burden of substantiating and proving Gala\u2019s prospects was undisputedly on Claimant. Claimant has failed to substantiate these prospects, let alone prove them, due to his position that the issue of causation had been pre-determined by the First Decision as a matter of *res judicata267.* Claimant has maintained this position despite the Tribunal\u2019s advice to the contrary268.\n\nYet, Claimant had conceded his burden of proof if the Issue were to still to be heard (Audio procedural conference March 1, 2010, Mr. Gharavi).\n\nSee especially paras. 239, 244 - 246 supra.\n\n342.\n\nRespondent has requested the Tribunal to infer from Claimant\u2019s failure of substantiating Gala\u2019s prospects the absence of a causal link between Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing and Claimant\u2019s failure of realizing his - alleged - business expansion plans269. In support of this request, it has submitted that Gala had no prospects of winning additional frequencies. This submission has been substantiated frequency-by-frequency allotted during the Interregnum. It has furthermore been confirmed by the Third WS Kurus which in turn is supported by documentary evidence270\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, para. 153.\n\nSee para. 238 supra.\n\n343.\n\nMr. Kurus was presented as a witness in the Hearing on Remaining Issues of July 12, 2010. However, Claimant did not cross-examine him with a view to his insistence that the topic had been pre-determined by the First Decision. Although it had previously rejected this position, the Tribunal did not address any question to Mr. Kurus either.\n\n344.\n\nI did not question Mr Kurus, because Claimant had the burden of proof for the facts to be testified by Mr. Kurus. Therefore, I considered Mr. Kurus\u2019 testimony as procedurally obsolete, its relevance in substance notwithstanding.\n\n345.\n\nContrary to my position, however, the Majority accepts a causal link between the Interregnum occurrences and Claimant\u2019s failed business expansion. This decision in my view required careful consideration of the only facts in point submitted during the Second Phase.\n\n346.\n\nThe Majority bases its decision solely on facts submitted during the first phase of the proceedings (Gala\u2019s market position in 1999, witness statements of Claimant and his collaborators during the first phase)271. While it has reserved its decision to the Second Phase, it thus could have taken it already in the first phase (as Claimant had understood it did).\n\nSee para. 302 supra.\n\n347.\n\nThe Majority dismisses Respondent\u2019s submission on causation. However, the Majority\u2019s determinations in point not only entail errors and oversights272. They are in my view procedurally inconclusive, as they fail to assess these objections frequency-by-frequency.\n\nSee paras. 311 - 328 supra.\n\n348.\n\nIn quintessence, the Majority had throughout the Second Phase advised that the issue of causation had still to be litigated but remedied Claimant\u2019s failure of substantiating his case by construing the required causal links entirely on the basis of facts and evidence submitted during the first phase of the proceedings. Based on summary observations rather than particularized assessments, the conclusions on the causal links are moreover inconsistent with the definition of the *\"cause\"* as deprivation of opportunities in tenders required by law but evaded.\n\n349.\n\nIn my view, this process has in effect relieved Claimant from his burden of substantiating (and proving) Gala\u2019s prospects with respect to frequencies allotted during the Interregnum, although this burden was implicit in the First Decision and the Tribunal\u2019s guidance in the Second Phase of the proceedings. As a consequence, Respondent was misled in building its defence.\n\n350.\n\nThe process violates Respondent\u2019s Right to be Heard *(audiatur et altera pars)* as set out by the annulment committee in the *Wena* case: *\"It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its (...) defence and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level (...)*273\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, Febr. 5, 2002. paras. 56, 57. Cf. also Christoph H. Schreuer at al., supra fn. 30, article 52, comments 285 - 287, 294, 295, 305ff; Gary B.

The Majority\u2019s Key Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nIn the previous chapter, I have discussed the procedural and substantive errors in the Majority\u2019s analytical process. In this chapter, I will address the doubts cast on the principal conclusions in light of common sense plausibility.\n\n352.\n\nKey to the Award are the conclusion that\n\n\u25a0 Gala would have operated a *\"full national network\"* as of January 1, 2001 but for Respondent\u2019s out-of-tender allocation of frequencies during the Interregnum (chapter II.B. Infra); and\n\n\u25a0 Such a network would have boosted Gala\u2019s actual net enterprise value of USD 126,290 to a hypothetical net present value of USD 8,844,150 (chapter I I.C. Infra).\n\n353.\n\nThese conclusions must be appreciated in the light of different levels of probability required in the Majority\u2019s opinion for establishing *\"causation\"* (i.e, the *full national network),* and damages (the net present values), respectively:\n\n354.\n\n*\"The Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the in bonis party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonably confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.*274\n\nSee para. 246 of the Award.\n\n**II.B. Full National Network**\n-------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nThe Majority concludes its analysis of *causation* with the decision that Respondent\u2019s compliance with the FET standard during the Interregnum would have added fourteen frequencies to Gala\u2019s network boosting its coverage from twenty-two percent to the entire population of Ukraine from 2001 onwards.\n\n356.\n\nBefore 2006, only the Ukrainian State Radio Company covered more than half of the oblasts of Ukraine275. The Majority\u2019s decision thus implies that Gala would during the Interregnum have received more frequencies than any other broadcaster in Ukraine had Claimant been treated fairly and equitably.\n\nSee para. 333 supra.\n\n357.\n\nAt most twenty frequencies allotted during the Interregnum could possibly have been awarded to Gala. The Majority thus assumes a success rate of Gala of some seventy percent in all tenders in which it would have qualified. This assumption must be appreciated against the background that all broadcasters in Ukraine at the time would in principle have been entitled to compete in these (hypothetical) tenders and that the Majority has not considered the particular circumstances of any tender. And even the assumption of twenty available frequencies is based on the dismissal of all objections by Respondent276.\n\nSee paras. 315 - 328 supra.\n\n358.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Majority has concluded that the denial of over 200 applications of Gala for additional frequencies between 2001 and 2008 *\"cannot provide conclusive evidence that Respondent has violated the FET standard*277. The reasons advanced for Gala\u2019s assumed success during the Interregnum - Gala\u2019s alleged overall competitive strength - would in principle have also applied to the tenders between 2001 and 2008. This makes it difficult to reconcile a decision that Fair and Equitable Treatment required allocation to Gala of 14 out of 20 available frequencies in hypothetical tenders during March 1999 and June 2000 (the Interregnum) while it did not require any award on over 200 applications in actual tenders during 2001 to 2008.\n\nPara. 330 of the First Decision.\n\n359.\n\nIf anything, only the erosion of Gala\u2019s market position from 1999 onwards could in my view explain this distinction. This explanation, however, confirms my point that Gala\u2019s position in 1999, while relatively strong, was not sustainable278. Gala\u2019s 1999 position in the Kyiv market thus provides no evidence of Gala\u2019s outstanding competitive strength assumed by the Majority as foundation of its decision that Gala would have gained the needed fourteen frequencies but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing279\n\nSee para. 313, 314 supra.\n\nSee para. 312 supra.\n\n360.\n\nGala\u2019s initial success and subsequent market failure can indeed be explained quite naturally. Gala assumed its operations in 1995 right upon the (partial) privatisation of the radio sector and shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the lifting of the \"iron curtain\". In this historical environment, Gala started a program focussing on Western hit music, riding on the first wave of pro-Western enthusiasm, especially among the youth in Kyiv. Subsequently, this \"first mover\u2019s advantage\" subsided, as other stations also broadcasted Western music and a new emphasis on Ukrainian cultural identity supplanted the orientation towards the West and, with it, the popularity of Gala\u2019s program280. This development was foreseeable in 1999, placing Gala in a weaker competitive position for additional frequencies than its one-time popularity might have suggested at first glance.\n\nThis explanation is supported by the record of this arbitration. In 2006, a fifty percent Ukrainian music requirement was introduced through amendment of the LTR (new article 9(1)). Claimant considered this amendment as an \"expropriation\", seeking USD 958,000 compensation. He alleged that \"*this new requirement will adversely affect Gala, which built its image on a \"100% Hits\" slogan\"* ('Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 207 and Post-Hearing Memorial, paras 148, 149). The Tribunal unanimously dismissed this claim (paras. 501 - 511 of the First Decision). The claim shows, however, that Gala still in 2006 adhered to its initial program concept and lost out due to market and policy developments unrelated to the denial of additional frequencies.  \n This fact is moreover documented by Gala\u2019s financial record. In 2008, its expenses skyrocketed to UAH 10, 4 million against UAH 6,3 million in each 2007 and 2009. This was due to the expenses of a Brand Support report commissioned to innovate Gala\u2019s program and reposition it on the Ukrainian music market (see Goldmedia Supplementary Report, Exhibit 25 at p. 34).\n\n361.\n\nFurthermore, Gala, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement was afforded ten frequencies by the State Committee during the period of the Interregnum281. The Majority\u2019s decision that Gala should have received fourteen frequencies during the Interregnum implies that it should have been awarded a total of twenty-four frequencies during the same period - fourteen in hypothetical tenders and another ten under the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSix frequencies were allocated by May 15 and another four by June 13, 2000 (para. 157 of the First Decision). The attendant licences of the National Council were granted subsequently. This process mirrors the administrative process during the Interregnum where frequencies had first been allotted by the UCRF and attendant frequencies were subsequently granted by the National Council upon its reconstitution.\n\n362.\n\nRead together, the above facts cast serious doubts on the plausibility of the Majority\u2019s decision that, absent Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing, Gala would have won fourteen additional frequencies needed for a nationwide network during the Interregnum. These doubts are reinforced by Claimant\u2019s burden of proving Gala\u2019s assumed success in the hypothetical tenders. As per the Majority, this proof requires showing a *\"reasonable certainty\"282;* under German law (complementing pertinent recovery rights under EU law) a *\"probability bordering at certainty\"* must be established283\n\nPara. 245 of the Award.\n\nPara. 28383 supra.\n\n**II.C. Gala\u2019s Hypothetical Net Enterprise Value**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**II.C.1. The Majority\u2019s Calculation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Majority calculates Claimant\u2019s loss in terms of the difference between Gala\u2019s actual net enterprise value (Scenario I) and Gala\u2019s hypothetical net enterprise value estimated but for Respondent\u2019s breaches of the FET standard (Scenario II), both values as of 2010. This difference reflects the profits lost by Claimant due to Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing. The profits are computed in accordance with the discounted cash flow method for the period 2001 through 2015284.\n\nSee paras. 255, 260, 261 - 294 of the Award.\n\n364.\n\nThe calculation is presented in para. 296 of the Award:\n\nActual Enterprise Value (Scenario I): 126,290 USD  \nHypothetical Net Enterprise Value (Scenario II): 8,844,150 USD  \nClaimant\u2019s Compensation Awarded: 8,717,860 USD\n\n365.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s calculations follow Claimant\u2019s expert witness285,286. The Majority makes one exception, though. Claimant had added to the cash flows for 2001 - 2015 a *\"terminal* *value\"* equal to seven times the discounted cash flow estimated for 2015. In line with Respondent\u2019s objection, the Majority declines addition of this *\"terminal value287.*\n\nGoldmedia First Report 2008 (\"GFR\") and Goldmedia Supplementary Report 2010 (\"GSR\").\n\nGFR, p. 18 and HTRI, p. 128. and paras. 288, 294 of the Award.\n\nParas. 267 - 271 of the Award.\n\n366.\n\nRespondent had objected to Goldmedia\u2019s (Claimant\u2019s expert witness\u2019) assumptions and calculations288 and submitted two reports of EBS Expertise Services (initial report 2008 and supplementary report 2010). EBS has performed an alternative calculation of Claimant\u2019s losses, accepting *arguendo* Claimant\u2019s basic assumption, i.e., nationwide coverage of Gala 2001 - 2015, but substituting assumptions as to exchange rate USD:UAH, inflation rate, revenue and expense estimates, etc deemed to be more realistic than the ones relied on by Goldmedia. On that basis, EBS has calculated a net loss of Claimant of USD 190,490 USD, comparing with USD 26,787,330 calculated by Goldmedia and USD 8,844,150 awarded by the Majority289.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 337 - 399.\n\nSee EBS Supplementary Report, pp. 52, 53.\n\n367.\n\nThe Majority portrays its award as a *\"fair estimate\"'. \"While it is true that some of the assumptions are debatable, the Tribunal finds that, all in all, the model created by Claimant\u2019s expert witness represents a fair estimate of how Gala would have developed until 2015, if it had been awarded the necessary licences to become a national network in 2001(...) it is reasonable to project that Gala Radio would have managed to produce a free cash flow of roughly 3M USD in 2008 and 6 M USD in 201* 5\"290.\n\nPara 289 of the Award.\n\n368.\n\nFinally, the Majority considers the award to be proportional to Claimant\u2019s investment, although only some USD 141,000 have been duly recorded. The Majority finds that Claimant\u2019s *\"personal assets and those of Gala Radio have been somewhat commingled\"* and estimates his actual investments *\"in the region of between 2 and 3 M USD\".* in the Majority\u2019s opinion, consideration of a risk and commitment premium is in order: *\"Adequate proportionality* (,..)[cannot be measured] *in cash alone but in a combination of cash, risk-taking, personal commitment, and the essential contribution of a path-breaker*291*.*\n\nSee paras. 303 - 306 of the Award.\n\n**II.C.2. Award of Speculative Profits**\n----------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s determination, additional profits due to fourteen frequencies that Gala should have won during the Interregnum would have catapulted Gala\u2019s present enterprise value from USD 126,290 to 8,844,150, i.e., they would have multiplied Gala\u2019s value by 70. This conclusion in my view, reflects audacious speculation.\n\n370.\n\nThe disproportionality between Gala\u2019s actual performance and its estimated performance but for Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing during the Interregnum becomes even more striking if the Majority\u2019s estimate of Claimant\u2019s USD 2 to 3 million investment in Gala is factored into the calculation. If this investment is related to Gala\u2019s actual net enterprise value of 126,290 USD assumed by the Majority, then Gala must have generated a net loss of some 2 million USD between 1995 (the time of Claimant\u2019s initial investment) and 2010. In the Majority\u2019s estimation, fourteen frequencies in addition to its existing thirteen would have turned around Gala\u2019s record of losses into a profitability multiplying Gala\u2019s net enterprise value 70times.\n\n371.\n\nSuch an assumption would have to be explained against the background that Gala\u2019s ratings in Kyiv have dropped from no. 1 or 2 to no. 15 in 2010. Since Gala has had a strong frequency in Kyiv since 1995, this erosion of its position cannot be linked to a lack of frequencies292. Moreover, Gala\u2019s existing frequencies cover the locations focal to Claimant\u2019s initial business plans293. Furthermore, as one of 15 national broadcasters out of some 538 radio stations in Ukraine, Gala is still a relatively large radio company. If profitability were primarily determined by economies of scale, the bulk of Ukrainian radio stations would be prone to making losses. Against this background, the Majority\u2019s reference to potential economies of scale (fn. 320 of the Award) appears to be a tenuous explanation at best for the assumed dramatic impact of the additional frequencies.\n\nSee para. 313 supra.\n\nSee paras. 19, 54 supra.\n\n372.\n\nThe Majority furthermore accepts Goldmedia\u2019s reliance on the accuracy of Gala\u2019s financial statements, dismissing Respondent\u2019s pertinent objections294. However, the financial statements are bound to be inaccurate since they fail to reflect Claimant\u2019s actual contributions to Gala and thus overstate its profits or understate its losses, as the case may be.\n\nParas. 293, 294 of the Award.\n\n373.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s determination, the unrecorded investment is more than 14times the recorded. As per Claimant, the unrecorded investment was made over time; it included the rent-free lease of office space, the out-of pocket payment of operational equipment, licence fees and marketing expenses as well as the provision of a credit facility295. Claimant\u2019s off-the-record \"investments\" thus covered operating expenses of Gala; in fact, they subsidized Gala\u2019s operations. As they were not reported, they resulted in over-reporting Gala\u2019s profits or under-reporting Gala\u2019s losses, as the case may be. Thus, Gala\u2019s financial statements, and its profits and loss accounts in particular, were evidently inaccurate296.\n\nParas. 132, 299 - 302 of the Award.\n\nThe Majority considers the inaccuracy of Gala\u2019s financial statements as *\"unproven\"* and *\"not addressed by any of the experts\"* (fn. 315 of the Award). However, the inaccuracy follows logically from the failure of reporting Claimant\u2019s out-of-his-own-pocket payments of Gala\u2019s business expenses. Also, Respondent and its expert witness EBS have challenged the accuracy of Gala\u2019s financial statements (EBS Supplementary Report 2010, p. 13, 28, 29 and Respondent\u2019s CMRI, paras. 337 - 366). See paras. 535 - 539 on the Majority\u2019s critique in point.\n\n374.\n\nGoldmedia\u2019s reliance on inaccurate financial statements casts doubts on its projections. A comparison of Gala\u2019s earnings for 2008 and 2009 as anticipated in Goldmedia\u2019s initial 2008 report with Gala\u2019s actual earnings in these years reinforces these doubts. Goldmedia had projected combined earnings for the two years of 715,000 USD while Gala subsequently reported combined losses of 345,000 USD297.\n\nSee EBS Supplementary Report, Appendices B-1-8 and B-1-9, Gala\u2019s Financial Statements for 2008 and 2009. The discrepancy cannot just be attributed to the financial crisis of 2008. While the crisis may in part be responsible for the drop of Gala\u2019s revenues from million 9,1 UAH in 2008 to 5,66 UAH in 2009, It cannot explain the Increase of Gala\u2019s expenses from million 6,3 UAH in 2007 to 10,497 UAH in 2008 (see GSR, Exhibit 25, at p. 34)..\n\n375.\n\nIn these circumstances, the striking discrepancy between the projections of Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s expert witnesses of Gala\u2019s hypothetical value but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing (USD 26,787,330 v. USD 190,490) indicates the speculative nature of any figure.\n\n376.\n\nAs is commonly recognized in international law, compensation includes loss of profits only *\"insofar as it is established*298*.* The Commentary on the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explains: *\"Tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements\"299.*\n\nArticle 36(2) of the ILC Articles.\n\nCommentaries on Article 36 of the ILC Articles, note 27.\n\n377.\n\nThe Majority *\"agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty...\"* However, the Majority continues to opine that *\"Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss\"* (para. 246 of the Award).\n\n378.\n\nThis position is inconsistent with established international practice on the recovery of lost profits: *\"in cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable. This has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or, in some cases a well-established history of dealings\u2019'300. \"Clear and convincing evidence of ongoing and expected profitability\"* is the commonly accepted yardstick for the award of *lucrum* cessans.Gala\u2019s assumed profits neither ensue from income-producing property nor do they represent *\"a contractually protected income stream\".* They meet established standards only if evidenced by Gala\u2019s earnings history - past profits are the primary indicator of future profits301\n\nCommentaries on Article 36 of the ILC, note 27 and fn. 566 with references.\n\nCommentaries on Article 36 of the ILC Articles, note 28 and fn. 570 with references.\n\n379.\n\nHowever, for the period of 2001 - 2009 Gala reports highly volatile net earnings, clustering between minus 1,691,000 UAU, i.e., 211,375 USD in 2008 and plus 136,000 UAH, i.e., 17,000 USD in 2005, accruing to a net loss of 2,677,000 UAH, i.e., 334,625 USD for the entire period302. Gala\u2019s actual loss moreover significantly exceeds its recorded loss due Claimant\u2019s unreported \"investments\" into Gala (para. 370 supra). As per the Majority\u2019s estimation of these investments, Gala has generated a net loss of some 2 million USD between 1995 (the time of Claimant\u2019s initial investment) and 2010 (the time of determining Gala\u2019s present net enterprise value)303. Thus, Gala\u2019s earnings record provides anything but an indication of future profits the anticipation of which could multiply Gala\u2019s present enterprise value by seventy.\n\nSee GSR, Exhibit 25 at p. 34.\n\nin the Majority\u2019s critique (fn. 332 of the Award), my alleged comparison of *\"an accounting item - investments-with an enterprise value calculated under a DCF analysis -* [compares] *apples with oranges. But that is not all: applying basic accounting and financial logic, it is not true that (i) amounts invested minus (ii) DCF enterprise value equates to (Hi) losses\".*  \nThe Majority overlooks that Claimant\u2019s \"Investments\" do not represent an *\"accounting item\" -* they have not been accounted for at all. They rather represent off-the-record contributions Into Gala over time with a cumulative monetary value clustering in the Majority\u2019s estimate between million USD 2 and 3. The *\"DCF enterprise value\"* in the Majority\u2019s definition represents the *\"as is\" value of Gala Radio - what the investor now actually owns* (para. 262 of the Award). If the Majority\u2019s definitions are followed, the monetary value of Claimant\u2019s cumulative contributions Into Gala minus the \"real\" value of Gala in 2010 represent Claimant\u2019s accumulated loss. The formula admittedly entails an Imprecision in that It Ignores accrued Interests from Claimant\u2019s contributions in the past. Capturing Interests through a reverse cash flow calculation would further Increase Gala\u2019s loss.\n\n380.\n\nThe Majority acknowledges the aforementioned precedents but opines that they are not applicable to the FET standard in general and to the case at hand in particular304. This position reverts to the core of my dissent. In my view, the established limitations for recovery of lost profits clearly apply to violations of the FET standard; and they especially command respect in the tender scenario of this arbitration305\n\nFn. 318 of the Award: *\"But what Dr. Voss does not see is that this general rule cannot be applied for the calculation of damages in cases of violation of the FET Standard\".* The Majority further comments: *\"The \"but for\" value* [of Gala], *however, has no relationship with Gala Radio\u2019s actual profits; it is premised on Gala\u2019s hypothetical earnings (not on its actual) earnings record, if Ukraine had adhered to the FET Standard\".*  \n The comment overlooks that under applicable precedents the credibility and thus recoverability of hypothetical future earnings depends on past actual earnings.\n\nSee paras. 284 - 286 supra. See also paras. 535 - 539 Infra on the Majority\u2019s critique.\n\n**II.D. Conclusions**\n---------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe analysis of the Award in chapters I and II supra boils down to the following conclusions:\n\n**II.D.1. The Majority Construes an Implausible \"Full National Network\" at variance with Precedents under International Law and Municipal Laws**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n382.\n\nThe Majority concludes that Gala would have operated a \"full national network\" as of January 1, 2001 with the benefit of fourteen additional frequencies. These Gala would have won in tenders during the Interregnum had such tenders been held as required by law. The assumption of such \"full national network\" provides the foundation for calculating Claimant\u2019s compensation. However, the assumption has been construed at variance with applicable precedents under both international law and municipal laws.\n\n383.\n\nAlthough Respondent\u2019s liability, as determined in the First Decision, attaches to a frustration of Gala\u2019s chances in hypothetical tenders, the Majority has not analyzed such chances in any particular tender situation. It just has concluded that Gala would have won fourteen frequencies needed for a \"full national network\" owing to its superior competitive strength (market position in Kyiv in 1999 and impressive presentations of Claimant and his staff).\n\n384.\n\nSpecific circumstances cast serious doubts on the plausibility of the above conclusion, notably\n\n\u25a0 The availability of twenty frequencies at most for allocation to Gala, suggesting a success rate of seventy percent in tenders against potentially all radio broadcasters in Ukraine at the time;\n\n\u25a0 The erosion of Gala\u2019s market position in Kyiv after 1999; and\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s inadequate recorded capital.\n\n385.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s above conclusion without assessment of particular tenders falls short of the analysis required by the Tribunal in the *GAMI* case306. Claimant has not *\"particularized\"* which additional frequencies Gala would have secured but for Respondent\u2019s violations and what additional profits would have accrued to such frequencies.\n\nSee paras. 293 - 295 supra.\n\n386.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s analytical process moreover contrasts European and German laws. These require, as a condition of any recovery in tender situations, proof of a \"real chance\" in particular tenders. Moreover, European law does not provide for recovery of lost profits in tender situations; and precedents under German law for that purpose require proof of probability bordering at certainty that claimant would won the tender but for the rule violation. These precedents indicate specific general principles of law in point307.\n\nSee paras. 272, 273 supra.\n\n**II.D.2. The Majority Estimates an Implausible Loss at variance with Established Principles of International Law and Municipal Laws**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Majority concludes that a \"full national network\" as of January 2001 would have boosted Gala\u2019s net enterprise value seventy-times. And the Majority calculates Claimant\u2019s compensation in terms of the balance between Gala\u2019s assumed net enterprise value (with the national network) and its actual value as of 2010.\n\n388.\n\nAgain, specific circumstances cast doubts on the plausibility of this conclusion, notably:\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s negative earnings history with a cumulative loss of some USD 2 million during 1995 to 2010;\n\n\u25a0 The unreliability of Gala\u2019s financial statements in light of unrecorded \"investments\" estimated by the Majority between USD 2 and 3 million against recorded investments of USD 141,000;\n\n\u25a0 The erosion of Gala\u2019s market position in Kyiv; and\n\n\u25a0 Gala\u2019s inadequate and Claimant\u2019s unproven financial capacity.\n\n389.\n\nAgainst the above background, the Majority\u2019s estimate of Claimant\u2019s loss in my view represents audacious speculation. It departs from the established international law principles militating against an award of speculative profits. And it diametrically runs counter municipal laws confining or not at all envisaging recovery of lost profits in tender situations.\n\n**II.D.3. The Majority\u2019s Decision Sets an Unfortunate Precedent.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe present case, as far as researched, represents the first case awarding lost profits due to frustrated tender opportunities. It thus is bound to set a precedent for the development of international law in point.\n\n391.\n\nCompetitive tenders are commonplace in economic life. In market economies, they are usually required by law for public procurement. This makes the precedent set by this Award important in practice.\n\n392.\n\nIn tenders, BIT protected investors compete with domestically-owned enterprises (and foreign investors without BIT protection). Special protection of (some) foreign investors may conflict with the fairness and effectiveness of the tender process (level playing field concept). BIT protection must be balanced against the integer functioning of the host country\u2019s legal system. This draws attention to this Award in legal doctrine.\n\n393.\n\nIn my view, the Majority\u2019s Award sets an unfortunate precedent. It not only departs from principles for good reason established in international law against awarding speculative profits; and it not only contrasts municipal laws in point308. More importantly, it extends recovery rights in competitive tenders beyond the level sustainable as a general principle. It thus fosters divergence of international law principles from corresponding municipal laws. This is especially sensitive in an area where BIT protection must be reconciled with fair competition.\n\nin the Majority\u2019s opinion, European and German laws *\"have no bearing whatsoever on the calculation of damages for an international wrong committed by Ukraine against an American investor\"* (fn. 322 of the Award). In my view, however, these laws, by way of examples, reflect *\"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\"* within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute.  \n European law is more than just the law of the Union. Due to its mandatory transformation Into the laws of Member States, It determines the municipal laws in point of 27 States (para. 277 supra).  \n The German law referred to provides an example of the transformation of the relevant EU Directive Into Member State law. The German case law - jurisprudence complementing EU law by allowing recovery of lost profits due to tender violations is based on the doctrine of *culpa in contrahendo* (paras. 282, 283 supra). This doctrine emanates from Roman law and is found in many legal systems. It moreover bears some analogy to the FET standard, notably regarding the protection of legitimate expectations.  \n As explained above (para. 287 supra), It finally is Immaterial that the relevant European and German law is placed in the context of competition legislation. What justifies the analogy is the fact that It specifically addresses recovery rights in competitive tenders, I.e., the scenario present in this arbitration.\n\n394.\n\nThe Award operates precisely towards the peril curbed by municipal laws in point - it opens the floodgate of claims from frustrated tender applicants potentially accumulating to \"liability avalanches\" for the States concerned309. Ukraine\u2019s practice during the Interregnum has deprived all broadcasters in Ukraine at the time of tender opportunities just as Gala (except few beneficiaries)310. If municipal Ukrainian law corresponded to international law as construed by the Majority, all deprived broadcasters could successfully bring similar claims as Claimant. If then Ukrainian courts estimated losses with a view to claimants\u2019 alleged business expansion plans as liberally as the Majority, the awards could in the aggregate easily exceed the value of the frequencies allotted during the Interregnum manifold - at the expense of the Ukrainian taxpayer.\n\nSee paras. 284 - 286 supra.\n\nSee paras. 216 - 218 supra.\n\n**II.D.4. The Award Exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s Powers**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Majority has - in my opinion - overstretched the scope of the FET standard to construe a liability of Respondent in principle311. With the Award, the Majority over expands customary international law principles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts complementing the FET standard of the BIT. The Majority thus facilitates awarding compensation which appears excessive in relation to Claimant\u2019s (proven) investment and his past earnings record.\n\nSee paras. 146 - 149 supra.\n\n396.\n\nThe Majority departs from international law principles containing State liability (no award of speculative profits); and it ignores municipal laws serving a similar purpose with a view to the special tender scenario underlying this arbitration. It thus one-sidedly shifts the balance between the protection of Claimant under the BIT and Ukraine\u2019s interest in the proper functioning of its domestic regulatory system.\n\n397.\n\nSuch balance in my view is fundamental to the FET standard; and it determines its scope. The latter cannot be construed to resulting in unfairness to the host state and other stakeholders involved - in the present case Gala\u2019s domestic contenders for frequencies. *Object and purpose* of the FET standard in the *context* of the BIT do not cover the extension of Ukraine\u2019s liability beyond established principles with prejudice to the functioning of its regulatory system.\n\n398.\n\nThese limits command special respect in the present case where the liability is solely based on an assumed violation of domestic law incorporated into the FET standard by construing it as an umbrella clause. Here, recovery under the FET standard cannot be liberally construed to awarding compensation neither available to domestic Ukrainian business operators nor to business operators in other jurisdictions in like situations. Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to BIT protection312 further reinforces this aspect.\n\nSee paras. 129 - 138 supra.\n\n399.\n\nThis arbitration features a special scenario, with public tenders in competition with domestic actors, a regulated industry with limited BIT protection under a Reservation of the host country and priority treatment of Claimant under the Settlement Agreement as principal characteristics. In such scenario, the contours of the FET standard had to be carefully delimited with a view to countervailing interests.\n\n400.\n\nThe Majority does exactly the opposite. It not only ignores the aforementioned special features of the case. It moreover takes the road towards expanding both the FET standard itself and complementing international law principles at every crossing along the way of its analysis, ignoring established stop signs and barriers. In this way, the Majority systematically drives towards awarding Claimant compensation for his failure of realizing his alleged business expansion plans - a result somehow satisfying the Majority\u2019s feeling of fairness.\n\n401.\n\nIn quintessence, the Majority in my view transforms the FET standard into an empowerment to decide ex *aequo et bono.* This exceeds the boundaries of the FET standard, thus the scope of the BIT and hence the powers of the Tribunal.\n\n**III. ALLOCATION OF COSTS**\n----------------------------\n\n**III.A. THE MAJORITY DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Majority departs from the tradition in international investment arbitration of splitting the costs of the arbitration equally among the parties. Instead, it applies the \"the loser pays\" - principle.\n\n403.\n\nThe Majority further declares Claimant *\"the overall winning party, without having* *prevailed in each single issue.....* \u2019\u2019and awards him a partial reimbursement of his expenses in the amount of 750,000 USD. It reasons this award with its decision that *\"Respondent breached the BIT in most (but not all) of the situations alleged by Claimant,* [and has been] *awarded compensatory damages in an amount of 8,717,860 USD (...)\".* The Majority further declares Claimant *\"the overall winning party*313*.*\n\nSee para. 381 of the Award.\n\n404.\n\nClaimant\u2019s arbitration costs total 1,764,348 USD while Respondent\u2019s costs amount to 4,827,814 USD.\n\n**III.B. MY VIEW**\n------------------\n\n405.\n\nRather than offering a position on the basis of my dissent from the Award in substance, I will discuss below the Majority\u2019s allocation of expenses with a view to its Award.\n\n406.\n\nThe drafters of the ICSID Convention had initially envisaged that each party pay its own expenses and that the cost of the Tribunal and the Secretariat be borne equally by the parties. Tribunals were anticipated to depart from this principle only where one party has generated costs frivolously or in bad faith. Tribunals increasingly tend to award partial reimbursement of expenses to the victorious party, although no departure from the aforementioned traditional division of costs is established as principle314.\n\nSee Christoph H. Schreuer et al., supra fn. 31, article 61, notes 16-21.\n\n407.\n\nThe initially envisioned formula is acknowledged by Article VII(4) of the BIT as standard formula from which Tribunals may depart in their discretion.\n\n408.\n\nIn my view, the traditional apportionment of costs remains to be appropriate in cases where either party wins and looses in part, and neither party is responsible for frivolous or bad faith generation of costs. This would apply to the present case as decided by the Majority. And it would be fair to Claimant whose expenses are less than half of those of Respondent.\n\n409.\n\nThe \"the loser pays\" - principle is enshrined in many municipal laws. Its application is covered by the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Article VI l(4) of the BIT. Nevertheless, recognition of the cost-sharing principle as the established standard under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT in my view militates against departing from it without good cause.\n\n410.\n\nMoreover, if the Tribunal resorts to the \"loser pays\" - principle, it is in my opinion not at liberty to construe the principle at will; it must take into account the established practice of municipal laws adhering to this principle.\n\n411.\n\nThe German Code of Civil Procedure offers an example of such laws. Its para. 91(1) provides: *\"The losing party has to bear the costs of the litigation, especially to reimburse the costs of his opponent, to the extent that they were necessary for the purposeful pursuit or defence of rights\".*\n\n412.\n\nPara. 92(1) of the Code sets the rule in cases where each party wins and looses in part: *\"if each party wins in part and looses in part, the costs have to be offset against each other or apportioned proportionally. If the costs are offset, each party bears half of the costs of the court\".* The Code does not recognize the notion of an \"overall winner\" in case of partial loosing.\n\n413.\n\nA proportional apportionment of costs, as a rule, follows the ratio of the amount sought by claimant to the amount awarded by the court, i.e., Ratio x = Amount Sought : Amount Awarded. This ratio is then applied to the entire costs of the proceedings (costs of both parties plus court)315. As a result, Respondent could recover his costs from Claimant (rather vice versa) in the amount of USD 4,035,787316,317.\n\nSee Baumbach-Lauterbach-Albers-Hartmann, *Zivilprozessordnung,* 66th ed., 2008., para. 92, comment 33 and para. 2, comment 5.\n\nin the present case, the above formula leads to the following calculations: Ratio x = 55,173,000 : 8,717,860 =roughly 6 (Claimant): 1 (Respondent).Total costs of arbitration: USD 920,000 (Tribunal) + 1,764,348 (Claimant) + 4,827,814 (Respondent) = 7,512,162.  \n The total cost would then be split in the ratio 1 : 6; I.e., Respondent would bear  \n 1/6 times USD 7,512,162 = USD 1,252,027; and Claimant would bear USD 6,260,135.  \n As a result, Respondent would in principle be entitled to reimbursement from Claimant in the amount of USD 4,035,787 (x = (4,827,814 + 460,000) - 1,252,027 = 4,035,787).\n\nThe above amount could then be adjusted by the costs for which one party is exclusively responsible. As regards Respondent, these are amounts caused by the unsuccessful challenge of Mr. Paulsson and the moot proceedings on a provisional measure prompted by an erroneous calculation of the fee for renewal of Gala\u2019s licence. Claimant, on the other hand, would be exclusively responsible for the costs attributable to abandoned claims (Beauty Salon, Kiss and Energy trademarks, \"affiliation agreements\", \"continuous Interference\" on FM 100 frequency).\n\n414.\n\nReliance on the amount sought v. the amount awarded as starting formula for splitting costs under the \"the loser pays\" principle is not only established practice of (at least some) municipal laws; it is in my view also the most appropriate application of the principle. This approach discourages inflated claims. More importantly, it provides the only objective benchmark for measuring the relative merits of the parties\u2019 respective positions - the notion underlying the \"the loser pays\" principle.\n\n415.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s declaration of Claimant as the *\"overall winning party\u2019,* moreover, relies entirely on Claimant\u2019s success with claims brought under the BIT with respect to the allocation of frequencies. It ignores in particular that all his claims under the Settlement Agreement were dismissed. The declaration thus illustrates the subjectivity inherent in splitting costs on purely judgmental considerations.\n\n**PART THREE. THE MAJORITY\u2019S CRITIQUE OF MY SEPARATE OPINION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Overview**\n------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Majority includes in its Award a detailed critique of my Separate Opinion regarding the First Decision318. I had in the deliberations preceding the First Decision raised my main objections but reserved my Opinion to the Award. This approach had been agreed with my colleagues, because the relevance of my points of criticism to the award had not been anticipated at that time. It became clear with the Award based on the Interregnum.\n\nParas. 32 - 116 of the Award relating to paras. 1 -231 supra.\n\n417.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, my subsequent comments follow the Majority\u2019s critique, addressing\n\n(I) Claimant\u2019s legal standing;\n\n(II) The delineation of the FET standard;\n\n(III) Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations and the Settlement Agreement;\n\n(IV) Gala\u2019s record in tenders; and\n\n(V) The Interregnum.\n\nI will finally add some observations on the Majority\u2019s critique of my Opinion regarding the Award (ch. VI).\n\n**I. CLAIMANT\u2019S LEGAL STANDING319**\n-----------------------------------\n\nSee para. 70 supra.\n\n418.\n\nIn Part One, Chapter II supra, I argue that Claimant\u2019s claim with respect to Gala\u2019s failure to obtain additional frequencies represents a *\"shareholder derivative suit\"* on account of Gala (paras. 61, 62 supra); and I conclude that this suit is inadmissible (especially) by dint of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT (paras. 79 - 89 supra).\n\n419.\n\nThe Majority apparently agrees that the claim represents a *\"shareholder derivative suit\".* However, the Majority objects that\n\n(A) the issue concerns the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* (para. 35 of the Award);\n\n(B) the suit is covered by Article 1.1(a) of the BIT extending to *\"indirect investment\"* (para. 39 of the Award); and\n\n(C) the inadmissibility of the suit (assumed by me) cannot be considered since it was not pleaded (paras. 36 - 38 of the Award).\n\n**I.A. ISSUE OF JURISDICTION OR MERITS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nIn my opinion, the issue concerns the merits of the case rather than the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae*320. Claimant\u2019s shareholding in Gala is covered by the BIT. The question is what rights are attached to this shareholding, specifically whether it includes Claimant\u2019s right to seek recovery under the BIT for a violation of Gala\u2019s rights under Ukrainian industry regulations enjoyed by Gala in its capacity as a licensed broadcaster in Ukraine. The answer depends on pertinent Ukrainian law (Does it restrict exercise of the relevant rights to Gala as a corporate entity?) and Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT (Does it cover the restrictions under Ukrainian law?). These are issues of substantive Ukrainian law and the substantive scope of BIT protection321\n\nSee paras. 68, 102 supra.\n\nCf. Douglas, supra fn. 52, paras. 743, 744.\n\n**I.B. INDIRECT INVESTMENT**\n----------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThis issue is related to the aforementioned. Claimant\u2019s shareholding in Gala is undeniably covered by the BIT, although owned indirectly through Mirakom, another Ukrainian corporation. An encroachment by Ukraine on Claimant\u2019s shareholder rights could trigger BIT protection. Yet, the shareholder rights, by dint of the Reservation, do not encompass Gala\u2019s corporate rights attendant to its broadcaster\u2019s licence322\n\nCf. para. 83 supra.\n\n**I.C. RESPONDENT\u2019S PLEADING**\n------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nIt follows from the aforementioned observations that the issue at hand does not concern a *\"jurisdictional objection\"* but the substantive application of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to restrictions under Ukrainian law. Thus, Respondent did not have to raise a pertinent jurisdictional objection. Indeed, he could not have done so successfully323\n\nThe Tribunal would not depend on a Party\u2019s objection, even if the issue were considered as jurisdictional (see para. 426 infra).\n\n423.\n\nRespondent has denied any violation of the BIT; it has specifically objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction for claims out of requests for additional frequencies324 and it has submitted both the BIT (with Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to it) and the LTR (including all relevant restrictions). Yet, Respondent has not in express terms invoked the inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit. The question is therefore whether this argument had to be presented as a condition of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration or whether it was governed by the Tribunal\u2019s ex officio - mandate and the *\"iura novit curia\" maxim.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 183 - 188.\n\n424.\n\nMy co-arbitrator Jan Paulsson directs to the answer: *\"(...) are international tribunals in investment disputes organs of the international legal system and therefore bound to apply international law whether or not it is pleaded by the parties? The parallel with the ICJ and its Article 38 are obvious, and the implications are equally clear, as the ICJ put it in the Fisheries Jurisdiction cases:*\n\n*\"The Court (...) as an international judicial organ, is deemed to take judicial notice of international law, and is therefore required (...) to consider on its own initiative all rules of international law which may be relevant to the settlement of the dispute. It being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstance of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the parties for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court\"*\n\n*In other words, a tribunal in an investment dispute cannot content itself with inept pleadings (...)\"*325*.*\n\nJan Paulsson, *\"International Arbitration and the Generation of Legal Norms: Treaty Arbitration and International Law\" in* Transnational Dispute Management, v ol. 3, issue 5, Dec. 2006, p. 12/13.\n\n425.\n\nIn my view, Claimant\u2019s derivative suit is precluded by Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT326. The Reservation constitutes an integral part of the BIT delimiting the extent of its protection. The BIT is the primary basis of the Tribunal\u2019s power and represents an *\"international convention\"* in the meaning of Article 38(1 a) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. In interpreting and applying the BIT, the Tribunal *\"cannot content itself with inept pleadings\"* but must decide in accordance with *\"iura novit curia*327.\n\nParas. 79 - 89 supra.\n\nIt is Immaterial in my view that the application of the Reservation is dovetailed with the latter\u2019s exercise by Ukrainian law since the relevant law - the LTR - has been submitted to the Tribunal.\n\n426.\n\nThis view is supported by Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(2) of the Arbitration Rules, providing that *\"The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence\" and* that it *\"may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute (...) is within (...) its own competence\".* The ex officio - authority of the tribunal *\"is designed to avoid awards that exceed the tribunal\u2019s powers*328. This rationale applies regardless of whether the issue is regarded as a matter of jurisdiction or of the substantive extent of the BIT\u2019S protection (para. 420 supra).\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, fn. 30, Article 41, comment 44.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal should thus have dismissed Claimant\u2019s claim on ground of Respondent\u2019s failure of awarding Gala additional frequencies for want of admissibility of Claimant\u2019s shareholder derivative suit, Respondent\u2019s \"inept\" pleading on this point notwithstanding. Before doing so, the Tribunal should have heard the Parties, giving especially Claimant an opportunity to react329\n\nCf. para. 38 of the Award.\n\n428.\n\nAs the inadmissibility of Claimant\u2019s derivative suit flows from the Reservation limiting the extent of the BIT\u2019S protection, the topic dovetails with the scope of protection afforded by the FET standard. Even if the Tribunal had hesitated to dismiss the claim for want of proper pleading, it would have to take the admissibility aspect into account in delineating the ambit of the FET standard330.\n\nCf. para. 149 supra.\n\n**II. DELINEATION OF THE FET STANDARD331**\n------------------------------------------\n\nSee paras. 40 - 66 of the Award and paras. 104- 153 supra.\n\n429.\n\nThe Majority raises four objections to my Opinion on the delineation of the FET standard, namely that\n\n(A) Some of my arguments were not pleaded;\n\n(B) Ukraine\u2019s Reservation has no bearing on the FET standard;\n\n(C) Foreign investors legitimately enjoy additional protection over domestic to offset their lack of political rights; and\n\n(D) I misconceive the Majority\u2019s recognition of violations of tender rules as breaches of the FET standard.\n\n**II. A. Arguments Covered by Pleadings**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Majority notes that *\"the Separate Opinion....submits certain new arguments, which have never been pleaded in the case*332, without specifying what arguments are new.\n\nPara. 41 of the Award.\n\n431.\n\nRespondent has extensively argued against an *\"expansionist\"* application of the FET standard to the effect of construing an entitlement of Claimant to *\"special treatment\"* and *\"positive discrimination\"* over his domestically-owned competitors. In support of this position, Respondent has submitted a wealth of legal arguments and authorities333. My arguments are covered by this submission.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 328 - 335 and Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 390 - 396; 635, 636.\n\n432.\n\nMoreover, the delineation of the FET standard of the BIT is governed by the *\"iura novit curia\" maxim* (cf. para. 425 supra).\n\n**II.B. RESERVATION RELEVANT TO FET STANDARD**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nAs per the Majority, Ukraine\u2019s Reservation in the Annex of the BIT is immaterial to the FET standard, because\n\n(1) *\"The scope of the exception is limited to the national treatment principle\";* and\n\n(2) *Application of the exception requires prior notification and there is no evidence that* *such requirement has been complied with334.*\n\nSee para. 45 of the Award.\n\n**II.B.1. National Treatment Overlaps with FET Standard**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nI agree that the Reservation directly applies just to the \"national treatment\" principle of Article 11(1) of the BIT. Nevertheless, it is relevant to the interpretation of FET standard of Article 11 (3) of the BIT. This follows from the substantive overlaps of the two standards in the context of the BIT.\n\n435.\n\nAs rightly noted by the Majority335, the FET standard must be interpreted *\"in* [the] *context and in the light of* [the] *object and purpose\"* of the BIT336. The text of the BIT in its entirety provides the *context* of both the FET and the national treatment standard. This *context* comprises the Annex to the BIT and thus Ukraine\u2019s Reservation337. The national treatment principle and its qualification by the Reservation must hence be taken into account in interpreting the FET standard.\n\nPara. 257 of the First Decision.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties *(United NationsTreaty Series,* vol. 1155, p. 331)\n\nArticle 31(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n436.\n\nBy dint of the national treatment principle, Ukraine has undertaken to treat Claimant\u2019s investment in Gala *\"on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to investment (...) of its own nationals (...)\".* However, this undertaking is qualified by Ukraine\u2019s *\"right (...) to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors (...) listed in the Annex to the Treaty\",* i.e., the Reservation. The radio sector is included in the Reservation.\n\n437.\n\nWith its Reservation to national treatment, Ukraine pursues the *purpose* of safeguarding its freedom of according preferential treatment to its nationals over United States investors in the radio sector. This *object* and *purpose* connects the national treatment with the FET standard. The latter outlaws any *\"discriminatory measure\"* in relation to a U.S. investment in Ukraine (Article II 3 (b) of the BIT). Discrimination is the flop side of preference. A legitimate exercise of the Reservation according domestically-owned investments preference over U.S. owned would thus constitute a violation of the FET standard if the Reservation were ignored in the context of the latter.\n\n438.\n\nSince both FET standard and national treatment principle are placed in the logical *context* of the BIT, a preferential treatment of Ukrainian nationals cannot be considered as legitimate with respect to national treatment but at the same time as a breach of the FET standard. Such an interpretation would clearly defeat the *purpose* of the Reservation. The latter cannot be evaded simply by applying the FET standard rather than the national treatment principle.\n\n439.\n\nIn the present arbitration, Claimant, by virtue of the FET standard, asserts a right to treatment better than the treatment afforded to domestically-owned radio companies. Legitimating disadvantageous treatment of U.S. Investors vis-\u00e0-vis Ukrainian investors in the radio industry, the Reservation a *fortiori* militates against converting the FET standard into a right to preferential treatment338\n\nCf. paras. 129- 138 supra with references.  \n The drafting of the BIT referred to by the Majority\u2019s (paras. 46, 47 of the Award) in my view reflects the undisputed fact that the Reservation directly applies to national treatment only. This does not, however, preclude its consideration in the Interpretation of the FET standard in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The BIT had been signed in March 1994, i.e. before the proliferation of international investment claims under the FET standard (see paras. 139 - 145 supra). When they negotiated the Reservation, the State Parties had focused on national treatment only, because they had not foreseen the implications for the FET standard. While the Reservation cannot be retroactively applied to the FET standard, it still must be taken into account in Interpreting the latter with a view to an unprecedented scenario.\n\n**II.B.2. Notification**\n------------------------\n\n440.\n\nThe Majority further refers to Article I 1.1(h) of the BIT requiring notification of all exceptions to national treatment pursuant to the Reservation. In its view, exceptions are not covered by the Reservation unless notified. Respondent has not proven notification. *\"Consequently, it is legitimate to proceed on the basis that no such notification took place*\"339.\n\nParas. 48 - 51 of the Award.\n\n441.\n\nI disagree.\n\n442.\n\nAll exceptions to national treatment relevant in this arbitration are enshrined in the LTR. The validity of the LTR, including its exceptions to national treatment, is undisputed between the Parties. Claimant operates through Gala as its (indirect) shareholder in view of the exceptions restricting the role of foreign investors in the radio sector to investing in Ukrainian corporate entities. In the First Decision (para. 267), the Majority itself recognizes the validity of pertinent exceptions. Due notification of the LTR (if required), and all relevant exceptions with it, must therefore be assumed.\n\n442.\n\nMy argument for considering the Reservation in the interpretation of the FET standard moreover flows from the latter\u2019s authorization of exceptions to national treatment in principle, i.e., the very existence of the Reservation.The latter reflects the *common intent* of the Parties to the BIT to safeguard regulatory freedom in the radio sector with prejudice to the promotional purpose of the BIT; and, as a corollary, it cautions foreign investors in that sector340. This aspect is not related to specific exceptions and thus does not depend on their notification.\n\nSee paras. 133- 136 supra.\n\n**II.C. ADDITIONAL PROTECTION OF FOREIGN INVESTORS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**II.C.1. The Majority Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nThe Majority observes that BITs accord additional protection to foreign investors unavailable to domestic investors. \"A *wider scope of protection\"* for foreigners is in the Majority\u2019s opinion legitimate in view of limitations of most municipal laws as well as foreigners\u2019 lack of political rights heightening their exposure to arbitrary actions341\n\nParas. 56, 57 of the Award.\n\n444.\n\nAs per the Majority, the case at hand illustrates the legitimacy of expanded BIT protection: Initially received *\"with open arms\",* Claimant, *\"precisely because he was a* *foreigner, and lacked the close political connections of the Ukrainian media groups, was pushed aside, and deprived of the opportunity to compete with local investors on a level playing field\".* The BIT restored the level playing field, *\"which had been tilted against the foreign investor\"*342.\n\nParas. 59, 64 of the Award.\n\n445.\n\nTo support its position, the Majority highlights two tenders which in its decision have breached the FET standard. These tenders occurred on May 26, 2004 and October 19, 2005, respectively. Gala had participated in both tenders but lost out against broadcasters allegedly owned by political allies of then-president Yushchenko.\n\n**II.C.2. Legitimacy of BIT Protection**\n----------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s observation that BITs accord additional protection unavailable to domestic business operators. Such protection may, in particular, be afforded by the FET standard due to its *\"non-contingent\"* nature343. I also appreciate the legitimacy of such protection in principle344. However, I cannot subscribe to the Majority\u2019s explanation of the legitimacy of BIT protection; and I am concerned about the potential consequences of the Majority\u2019s legal policy position.\n\nCf. Iona Tudor, fn. 34, p. 182, 183 with references.\n\nCf. para. 119 supra.\n\n447.\n\nThe Majority starts its reasoning from the proposition that municipal laws typically deny adequate protection to business operators against unfair or inequitable treatment by authorities (para. 56 of the Award). Yet, municipal laws commonly provide broader remedies than reflected by the Majority. Remedies conventionally include recovery of damages in case of misuse of authority, breach of undertakings, false statements as well as rights to specific performance of public contracts or public law entitlements.\n\n448.\n\nIt is true that remedies under municipal laws are typically subject to restrictions, notably deadlines for challenging administrative decisions, statutes of limitations, requirements of mitigating damages and limitations of recovery345. Such restrictions normally serve legitimate public interests, such as legal certainty, efficiency of the legal and economic system, protection of conflicting stakeholder interests, prevention of misuse. It should also be recalled that recoveries of damages are ultimately paid by taxpayers. Limiting fiscal risks is not only legitimate; it is required by the public interest. By offering remedies on the one side and limiting them on the other, municipal laws legitimately try to balance the protection of individual rights with conflicting public interests346.\n\nCf. paras. 124 and 274 - 283 supra on European and German laws with respect to public tenders.\n\nSee para. 125 supra.\n\n449.\n\nAgainst this background, I find disquieting the Majority\u2019s attempt at grounding the legitimacy of BIT protection on perceived restrictions of municipal laws and explaining the fundamental rationale of BIT protection with a desirability of overcoming these restrictions to the benefit of BIT protected business operators. This legal policy position indeed can pave the way to construing the FET standard into an empowerment of tribunals ex *aequo et bono* to develop a case law superseding host countries\u2019 administrative laws even where they conform to recognized principles of law within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute. The Majority\u2019s decision sets a - in my view unfortunate - precedent into this direction347.\n\nCf. paras. 390 - 394 supra.\n\n450.\n\nDue to its sweeping open-ended language, the FET standard can indeed be expanded into a catch-all clause encompassing the entire legal and administrative framework for the interaction between business operators and public authorities. This feature explains the attractiveness of the standard and its growing importance in international investment arbitration. Yet, it also entails a grave risk - that the balance carefully crafted in developed market economy legal systems between individual and public interests becomes undermined through superseding case-law jurisprudence under international law.\n\n451.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s suggestion that foreigners deserve \"a *wider scope of protection\"* to compensate for their lack of political rights reinforces my concern.\n\n452.\n\nUnlike assumed by the Majority, an investor\u2019s exposure to arbitrary actions by authorities bears little relation to voting or other political rights. The Majority seems to confuse political rights with political connections. Foreign investors may, but by no means must, be at a disadvantage in building such connections. Large foreign investors might even be privileged in this respect.\n\n453.\n\nLack of political rights and differences regarding access to diffuse, or even illicit, political connections can in my view not be advanced to construing structural inequalities between domestically and foreign-owned businesses for the purpose of legitimating offsetting unequal legal protection. Such a doctrine would undermine the principle of equality of all private legal subjects under the law, fundamental to the rule of law.\n\n454.\n\nIn market economies, unequal legal protection moreover tends to distort competition. Fair and effective competition requires the same framework conditions for all business operators competing in the same economy. This necessity militates against different levels of legal protection, depending on the nationality of business owners. This aspect is gaining importance with the rapid globalization of capital movements, with increasing foreign ownership of domestic corporate citizens as a result.\n\n455.\n\nThese complexities in my view require self-restraint of tribunals in extending the FET standard to the treatment of businesses operating in the host country as its \"corporate citizens\" but owned by foreign investors348. This issue is especially sensitive where BIT protection tends to strengthen benefiting foreign investors in their competition with domestically-owned companies and thus may lead to \"reverse discrimination\" of the latter349\n\nThis distinction mirrors the distinction between \"shareholder rights\" and \"corporate rights\" in the context of recognizing the legal personality of foreign-owned corporations under International law (para. 68 supra). BIT protection of shareholder rights rarely entails conflicts with legitimate interests of the host country but special protection of corporate rights may.\n\nCf. paras. 84 - 88 supra.\n\n456.\n\nThe Majority sees no need to consider the impact of BIT protection on fair competition from the perspective of domestic investors350. This aspect is pivotal to my dissent from the Majority. In my view, it is captured by the *object and purpose* of the FET standard, especially in the *context* of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation351.\n\nCf. paras. 54, 55 of the Award.\n\nSee Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and paras. 84 - 87, 117 - 120, 393 - 401 supra.\n\n**II.C.3. No Discrimination of Claimant**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThe Majority suggests that *\"the facts proven in the present case are a good example of the role played by BITs\"* (para. 58 of the Award).\n\n458.\n\nI agree that the present case illustrates the ramifications of BIT protection and thus sets a precedent352. However, the Majority in my view misrepresents the facts proven and draws erroneous conclusions. The Majority features Claimant as a victim of discrimination. In support of this assertion, the Majority refers to the award of some 38 to 56 frequencies to *\"Gala\u2019s main competitors, controlled by powerful Ukrainian investors while Gala secured only one frequency on more than 200 applications\"',* and it highlights two specific tenders353.\n\nCf. paras. 390 - 394 supra.\n\nParas. 59 and 61 - 63 of the Award.\n\n459.\n\nThe Majority relies on occurrences in the period 2004 to 2008. The *\"main competitors\"* are the four most successful radio stations of Ukraine (out of 538 stations in total) which Claimant, to the Majority\u2019s satisfaction, has selected as Gala\u2019s benchmarks354. Out of the tenders with Gala\u2019s over 200 applications, Claimant has espoused five incidents with alleged improprieties. The Majority has found that three of these incidents breached the FET standard355, including the two highlighted tenders..\n\nSee paras.321, 322, 327 of the First Decision.\n\nParas. 421, 422 of the First Decision.\n\n460.\n\nIn the aforementioned three incidents, Gala lost alongside with some two to fourteen (at least predominantly) domestically-owned applicants. The Majority, in line with Claimant\u2019s pleading, has found violations of the FET standard due to the - assumedly - illicit preference accorded to the - purportedly politically connected - winners of these tenders. However, the Majority has not found (and Claimant has not pleaded) that Gala was targeted in its capacity as a foreign-owned company or in any way treated worse than the other unsuccessful applicants in these tenders. At most, Gala suffered a *\"reverse discrimination\"* alongside with several domestically-owned contenders in each instance356\n\nSee paras. 228 - 231 supra and paras. 354 - 356, 369 - 371, 383 - 385 of the First Decision.  \n The Majority challenges this analysis asserting that *\"domestically owned radio companies eventually obtained the number of licences required to create nation-wide radio channels\"* (para. 64 of the Award). However, Claimant has not pleaded, and no Indication has been submitted, that any radio station in Ukraine has received the number (and power) of frequencies required for a *\"nation-wide network\"* as understood by Claimant (reach of the entire population of Ukraine). Undisputedly, as late as 2006 no private broadcaster has operated such a network (para. 333 supra). Thus, no domestically-owned radio company has received the frequencies for such a network during the Interregnum March 1999 - June 2000, i.e., during the period in which in the Majority\u2019s decision Gala should have obtained all frequencies required for such a network operative as of January 2001.  \n Gala became a *\"national broadcaster\"* with the statutory redefinition of this term in 2006. It since shares this status with 14 other Ukrainian radio companies out of a total 538 (para. 333 supra). Thus, at most 14 radio companies have received more frequencies (or frequency power) than Gala while at least 523 have obtained less. I cannot see how a statistical evidence of a discrimination of Gala can be Inferred from the fact that relatively few domestically-owned companies topped Gala\u2019s success rate - and even that after the period establishing Respondent\u2019s liability as per the Majority\u2019s award.\n\n461.\n\nThe two highlighted tenders both concern frequencies sought to create a second - AM information broadcasting - network. The first such tender was held on May 26, 2004 and the second on October 19, 2005.\n\n462.\n\nIn the May **26, 2004 tender,** Gala competed with two non-profit broadcasters. Since no applicant received the required five votes, the National Council cancelled the tender and put the frequency up for a new tender on December 21, 2004. Gala did not participate in that second tender. The frequency was awarded to NART TV allegedly owned by Mr. Tretyakov, as per Claimant\u2019s submission a political alley of President Yushschenko. The only evidence for Mr. Tretyakov\u2019s *\"ownership\"* was a newspaper article stating that *\"Mr.* *Tretyakov...is of direct relevance\"* to NART TV.\n\n463.\n\nThe cancellation of the first tender affected Gala\u2019s domestically-owned contenders more than Gala. Those had each secured four votes and Gala only one. And as non-profit organisations, they were *prima facie* better qualified for information broadcasting than commercial Gala with no experience in this field357.\n\nInformation broadcasting is the domain of non-profit organizations due to its inherent lack of profitability. For that reason, the Majority has not Included the denial of pertinent frequencies in its calculation of compensation (see paras. 256-259 of the Award).\n\n464.\n\nThe Majority discards Gala\u2019s failure to participate in the second tender, accepting Claimant\u2019s explanation that *\"he deemed the effort futile\"358.* Yet, this explanation had been discredited by Claimant\u2019s initial allegation that the second tender had not been publicly announced and that *\"if such tender had been announced, Claimant would certainly have retendered for the frequency\"359.*\n\nSee para. 372 of the First Decision.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 205.\n\n465.\n\nAs regards the tender of **October 19, 2005,** the Majority\u2019s account omits two crucial facts, namely that (i) Gala lost alongside with five domestically-owned contenders and (ii) the winner undisputedly was the leading information broadcaster in Ukraine at the time while Gala was a newcomer. Absent the President\u2019s interference, the tender decision appeared to be unobjectionable.\n\n466.\n\nI nevertheless agree that the President\u2019s interference with the independent decisionmaking of the National Council violated applicable Ukrainian law. I disagree, though, that this violation amounted to a *\"discriminatory measure\"* within the meaning of Article 11.3(b) of the BIT. In the Majority\u2019s own, in my view correct, notion, such a measure *\"must expose the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice\"* or *\"target Claimant\u2019s investments specifically as foreign investment\"360.*\n\nSee para. 261 of the First Decision with references.\n\n467.\n\nThe President\u2019s interference did not *\"target\"* Gala. Nothing in the Parties\u2019 submissions indicates that the President was even aware of Gala\u2019s participation in the tender concerned. Gala at most suffered a \"reverse discrimination\" alongside with five other unsuccessful contenders due to the President\u2019s support for one preferred contender. This is unrelated to Gala\u2019s foreign ownership361.\n\nThe interference might nevertheless qualify as an *\"arbitrary measure\"* within the meaning of Article II.3.(b) of the BIT. As a *\"non-contingent standard\",* the FET standard Indeed potentially accords additional protection unavailable to domestically-owned competitors (para. 446 supra). However, Ukraine\u2019s Reservation to the BIT in my view precludes this possibility in the present case (see paras. 133 - 138 supra). This Incident might represent a borderline case, though.\n\n468.\n\nI hence fail to appreciate how the tenders during 2004 - 2008, including the highlighted tenders in 2004 and 2005, can support the Majority\u2019s proposition that Claimant has been victimized in his capacity as a foreign investor and therefore merits additional BIT protection to re-establish a level playing field between him and his domestically-owned contenders for market shares.\n\n469.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s reflection of the key facts of the case moreover shows its focus on political connections rather than political rights in reasoning the legitimacy of BIT protection (para. 452 supra). The Majority seems to consider Respondent\u2019s failure to extend political favouritism to Claimant as legitimate grounds for according him BIT protection. I cannot share such a proposition.\n\n**II.C.4. Inference from Tenders during 2004 - 2008 to Interregnum 1999 - 2001**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nThe Majority has not awarded compensation on account of any of the aforementioned three tenders which had occurred between May 2004 and February 2008. The award of compensation is rather exclusively based on the Interregnum, i.e., the allocation of frequencies to Gala\u2019s competitors between March 1999 and June 2000362. In relying on incidents between 2004 and 2008 as justification of an award based on occurrences in 1999 - 2000, the Majority implies an inference from the subsequent to the preceding period363.\n\nSee para. 233 supra and paras. 256, 261 of the Award.\n\nSee paras. 92, 93 of the Award. Cf. also para. 243 of the Award where the Majority, as Introduction to the determination of compensation, refers to Gala\u2019s failure of obtaining additional frequencies *\"for six years\"* on *\"more than 200 applications\"* as *\"the main finding in....the First Decision\".*\n\n471.\n\nThis inference in my view is both inadmissible and inconclusive. The Majority does not explain the relationship of the aforementioned three incidents to the occurrences during the Interregnum. In fact, no such relationship exists:\n\n\u25a0 The three incidents concern particular tenders while the Interregnum concerns the allocation of frequencies without tenders.\n\n\u25a0 In the three incidents, Gala was affected as a tender participant while in the Interregnum, Gala was deprived of opportunities of participating in tenders not held but assumedly required by law.\n\n\u25a0 The three incidents represent decisions of the National Council (an independent body under the Constitution) while the decisions during the Interregnum were made by the UCRF (a Government agency) in the absence of an operative National Council; and\n\n\u25a0 The three incidents concern the award of frequencies to (presumed) political allies of then-President Yushchenko while the Interregnum precedes the Yushchenko presidency.\n\n472.\n\nThe two highlighted tenders in particular concern frequencies earmarked for politically sensitive information broadcasting while no political relevance has been determined with respect to the frequencies allotted during the Interregnum. The President\u2019s interference with the October 19, 2005 represents a singular incident which bears no apparent relationship to the practice during the Interregnum.\n\n473.\n\nThe administrative practice during the Interregnum in no way targeted or singled out Gala, let alone Claimant as a foreign investor. At most, Gala was affected in its opportunities as a radio station in Ukraine, indistinguishably from any other station at the time, safe the few which had - assumedly illegally - benefited from the practice364.\n\nSee paras. 183, 216 - 218 supra.\n\n474.\n\nThe Majority cannot attribute the practice during the Interregnum to political favouritism, because it has not reviewed the particular allocations of frequencies during this period365 No information as to broadcasters that had benefited from the practice has been submitted. There is in particular no information as to whether any of the four \"benchmark radio companies\" (para. 461 supra) belongs to the beneficiaries. The Majority thus motivates its award of compensation with findings concerning occurrences unrelated to the incidents on which its award is based.\n\nSee paras. 287, 291 - 293 supra.\n\n475.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s reasoning, the three tenders during 2004 - 2008 *\"are fundamental factors for establishing Respondent\u2019s liability\"* but \"a *completely separate issue is that, for the purpose of calculating Claimant\u2019s damages\",* the Tribunal relies only on Claimant\u2019s lost opportunities during the Interregnum, i.e., in 1999 - 2000366. This reasoning implies that the Tribunal\u2019s misgivings of the three tenders influenced its decision on Respondent\u2019s liability on account of the practice during the Interregnum. It thus confirms an - in my view inadmissible - inference from the three tenders to the assumed deprivation of Gala\u2019s opportunities during the Interregnum367.\n\nParas. 92, 93 of the Award.\n\nThis impression is reinforced by the Majority\u2019s reflection on the role of BIT protection in the present case: *\"What the Treaty has achieved is the reestablishment of a level playing field, which had been tilted against the foreign investor. Gala was competing against domestic players which were able to use their preferential relationship with the public administration and the regulators to their own advantage. What the application of the BIT achieves is to redress a situation of discrimination - it does not create any privilege\"* (Para. 64 of the Award). The practice during the Interregnum in the Majority\u2019s finding was *\"arbitrary\"* but not *\"discriminatory\"* (para. 418 of the First Decision). The Majority thus justifies BIT protection with an assumed discrimination of Claimant that has occurred four to eight years after the Interregnum Incidents to which it attaches Respondent\u2019s liability. Such a retroactive activation of BIT protection is in my view Inadmissible.\n\n**II.D. Umbrella Concept**\n--------------------------\n\n476.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s view, my reservation against construing the FET standard as an \"umbrella clause\" elevating breaches of tender rules to international delicts is based on *\"a* *misconception\".* The Majority explains that *\"not every violation of domestic law necessarily translates into (...) a violation of the FET standard\"* but *\"a blatant disregard of applicable tender rules, distorting fair competition among tender participants\"* does368.\n\nPara. 43 of the Award.\n\n477.\n\nI have always stated my position specifically with a view to tender legislation rather than domestic law in general369. And I have argued that fair competition in tenders requires a *\"level playing field\"* including all contenders, irrespective of their nationality. BITs afford protection only to investors from home countries which have concluded such treaties with the host country concerned. They thus accord added protection to some contenders on account of their (corporate or personal) nationality unavailable to contenders without BIT umbrella. Such added protection might distort the *\"level playing field\".*\n\nSee paras. 126, 147 supra.\n\n478.\n\nFor that reason, I caution against instrumentalizing BITs for policing fair competition in tenders; and I suggest that a violation of tender rules does not ***ipso iure*** amount to a breach of the FET standard. To do so, the breach must affect rights (not just business prospects) of a BIT protected investor covered by the protective purpose of the BIT370. This requirement in my view is compelling in light of Ukraine\u2019s Reservation limiting BIT protection371. I therefore cannot subscribe to the Majority\u2019s approach of deducing a breach of the FET standard from a *\"blatant disregard of applicable tender rules\"* without further analysis372. This aspect is essential to the assessment of the practice during the Interregnum since this practice bears no relationship to Claimant in his capacity as a foreign investor373.\n\nSee paras. 121 - 128 and 147, 148 supra.\n\nSee paras. 129- 138 supra.\n\nSee para. 385 of the First Decision.\n\nCf. paras. 216-218 supra.\n\n**III. LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT374**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee paras. 67-91 of the Award and paras. 8-60 supra.\n\n479.\n\nThe Majority rejects my proposition that Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans are precluded from consideration in this arbitration by dint of the Settlement Agreement and that they can, in particular, not be related to legitimate expectations in the context of the FET standard. More specifically, the Majority asserts that:\n\n(A) Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations play only a subsidiary role to the Award;\n\n(B) Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations must be separated from his business expansion plans;\n\n(C) The Settlement Agreement cannot be construed as a waiver of BIT protection; and\n\n(D) Different assumptions of the Majority and me are rooted in different weight given to testimonies.\n\n**III.A. SIGNIFICANCE OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nThe Majority tones legitimate expectations down to play *\"a subsidiary role as a normative criterion\"375.* Nevertheless, legitimate expectations feature prominently in the Majority\u2019s reasoning, explicitly in the First Decision and implicitly in the Award.\n\nPara. 67 of the Award.\n\n481.\n\nIn the words of the First Decision, \"the *\"FET standard is closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations\"* (para. 264). Accordingly, the Majority performs a detailed analysis of Claimant\u2019s expectations (paras. 265 - 271 of the First Decision). In para. 285, legitimate expectations are recognized as a factor in establishing a violation of the FET standard. And in para. 371, the Majority declares the tender of May 26, 2004 as a violation of the FET standard with a view to Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n482.\n\nIn the Award, the Majority strongly relies on Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans but no longer refers explicitly to legitimate expectations376.\n\nSee paras. 90, 161, 162, 171, 174, 176, 177, 201, 203, 208, 243, 252, 256, 261, 296, 297 of the Award. Cf. paras. 252, 253 supra.\n\n**III.B. LINKAGE BETWEEN CLAIMANT\u2019S LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS AND HIS BUSINESS EXPANSION PLANS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nThe Majority distinguishes between legitimate expectations *\"on a general level\" and \"on* a *more specific and personal level*377. I will focus on the specific expectations378, notably their relation to Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans.\n\nPara. 69 of the Award.\n\nSee para. 15 supra on general expectations.\n\n484.\n\nThe latter are essential to the Award. They provide the basis for the Majority\u2019s decision that Claimant during the Interregnum would have received the fourteen frequencies required for a \"full national network\" had frequencies been put up for tender as required by law379 This decision in turn provides the basis for calculating Claimant\u2019s compensation. This begs the question of the legal context in which the business expansion plans assume such weight, more specifically, how they are related to Claimant\u2019s - assumed - legitimate expectations.\n\nSee paras. 161, 261, 302, 329 -335 supra.\n\n485.\n\nThe Majority relies on Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans also to Claimant\u2019s prejudice. It denies inclusion of Claimant\u2019s alleged plan of creating a second FM channel for young audience in its calculation of compensation (\"Scenario III\") on the ground *\"that Claimant\u2019s initial plans did not include the creation of a second FM network*380*.*\n\nSee para. 257 of the Award and cf. para. 270 of the First Decision.\n\n486.\n\nThe First Decision reflects the Majority\u2019s assumption that Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations encompass his business expansion plans. Its Chapter VII on *\"Violations of the BIT\"* starts with restating Claimant\u2019s position as follows: *\"Claimant\u2019s starting point is that, after having made the investment in Gala Radio, he had a legitimate expectation that he* *would be authorized (...) to establish three radio networks (...)\"* (para. 210 of the First Decision). This leads to the Majority\u2019s analysis of Claimant\u2019s pertinent expansion plans in paras. 269 - 271 under the heading \" Legitimate expectations \". The analysis flows directly from the definition of Claimant\u2019s *\"specific legitimate expectations\"* (para. 268).\n\n487.\n\nThe latter are defined as expectations *\"that Gala.....would be allowed to expand, in parallel with the growth of the private radio industry*381. The Majority redefines *\"in parallel with the growth of the private radio industry..\"* as *\"under the same conditions as the private radio industry in Ukraine\"* (para. 72 of the Award). Referring to framework conditions, I fail to see the difference between the redefined *specific expectations* and the *general expectations;* I just see the redefinition leading away from the business expansion plans.\n\nPara. 268 of the First Decision. I had understood this language as implying an expectation for preservation of Claimant\u2019s market share (cf. paras. 55, 56 supra).\n\n488.\n\nThe Majority now features legitimate expectations and initial business plans, respectively, as *\"separate concepts\" -* the former as a criterion *\"to construe the meaning of Article 11.3 of the BIT\"* and the latter *\"for the calculation of the damage suffered by Claimant\"* (para. 72).\n\n489.\n\nThe discussion of the relationship between Claimant\u2019s business plans and legitimate expectations, respectively, explains itself from the difference of opinion between the Majority and me regarding the effect of the Settlement Agreement on the Majority\u2019s decision. While the Majority denies any such effect, the Settlement Agreement in my view precludes consideration of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations in this arbitration with (negative) *res judicata* effect.\n\n490.\n\nThis difference of opinion cannot be resolved, though, by an attempt at conceptually divorcing Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans from his legitimate expectations. As stated by the Majority, *\"Claimant\u2019s starting point is that (...) he had a legitimate expectation that he would be authorized to increase the size and audience of his radio company, and to establish three radio networks..,\"382.* The Majority, in the Award, tries to separate Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans from his legitimate expectations. Nevertheless, the Majority assesses the evidence summarily with a view to these plans (paras. 296 - 299 supra); it defines the final effect of Respondent\u2019s assumed wrongdoing in terms of *\"Claimant\u2019s frustration to fulfil his plans and operate a nationwide FM channef\"* (para. 208 of the Award); and it computes Claimant\u2019s loss as the difference between the present value of Gala and the hypothetical value if the business expansion plan had been realized (para. 161 of the Award). Thus, in the Award, the Majority in fact relies on Claimant\u2019s business plans as if they had been established as legitimate expectations; and in the First Decision, the Majority does not differentiate Claimant\u2019s business plans from his legitimate expectations. In my view, the crucial question is whether and, if so, to what extent the Settlement Agreement precluded the consideration of Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans in this arbitration. This question must be answered through interpretation of the Agreement (paras. 497 - 507 infra).\n\nPara. 210 of the First Decision.\n\n**III.C. EVIDENCE OF BUSINESS EXPANSION PLANS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nThe Majority challenges my Opinion on its assessment of Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans in light of the evidence submitted383\n\nSee paras. 74 - 80 of the Award and paras. 40 - 54 supra.\n\n492.\n\nThese plans are relevant to the Award only inasmuch as they concern Gala\u2019s FM network (Scenario II)384.I will therefore confine my comments to the question whether the evidence can possibly sustain the Majority\u2019s key conclusion that Claimant\u2019s initial plans covered the creation of a *\"full national network\".*\n\nParas. 256, 261 of the Award.\n\n493.\n\nUnlike suggested by the Majority, my disagreement with its assessment is not just rooted in attaching *\"more weight to Mr. Petrenko\u2019s witness statement and less to (...) Mr. Lemire\u2019s (,..)\"385.* It is based on the documentary evidence submitted and the consistency of Mr. Petrenko\u2019s statement with applicable law at the time (cf. paras. 47 - 53 supra).\n\nPara. 74 of the Award.\n\n494.\n\nThe Majority accepts the letter of July 18, 1995 of then-National Council Chairman Petrenko *\"as clear proof that Mr. Lemire planned to build a FM national broadcaster (...) and that Respondent was aware of it\".* It further finds that *\"Respondent has not denied\"* that Claimant sought to achieve *\"national coverage\"386.*\n\nParas. 78 of the Award.\n\n495.\n\nHowever, Respondent has contested its awareness of Claimant\u2019s national coverage aspirations at that time, let alone admitting any indication of support. As per Respondent, discussions with Claimant as late as 1999 concerned creation of a *\"regional\"* rather than a *\"national\"* network\"387\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 321, 322.\n\n496.\n\nMoreover, the aforementioned letter does not entail any mention of *\"national coverage \"national network\" or* any other language referring to this notion388. It thus cannot possibly serve as proof of such an initial plan. And even less can it sustain the Majority\u2019s conclusion that Gala, as of January 1, 2001, would have operated a *\"full national network\"* but for its deprivation of tender opportunities during the Interregnum through Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing - the conclusion providing the foundation of the Award.\n\nSee paras. 47, 48 supra.\n\n**III.D. PRECLUSIVE EFFECT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe Majority confines the Settlement Agreement to the claims filed in the First Arbitration: *\"The purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to finally settle all claims which Claimant had filed in an ICSID Additional facility Arbitration against Ukraine. Claimant agreed to waive these claims, and as a quid pro quo Ukraine agreed to appoint a* *commission of experts.....and to use its best efforts to consider in a positive way certain* *applications for radio frequencies submitted by Gala (....). This implies that the settlement cannot refer to claims which did not exist as of the date of execution of the Settlement Agreement, or which, existing at that time had never been mentioned in documents, letters or correspondence\".* Since the claims pending in this arbitration were not *\"mentioned in documents, letters or correspondence predating March 20, 2000\",* they are in the Majority\u2019s opinion not affected by the Settlement Agreement389.\n\nParas. 85, 87, 88 of the Award.\n\n498.\n\nThe Majority further dismisses Respondent\u2019s argument that the Settlement Agreement precluded an award on account of the allocation of frequencies under the Interregnum. As per the Majority, *\"there is no evidence that, when the Settlement Agreement was executed, Claimant was even aware of Respondent\u2019s irregular practice (...) whatever may have been* *agreed in the Settlement Agreement cannot be considered as Claimant\u2019s acquiescence with Ukraine\u2019s wrongful conduct\"*390\n\nPara. 185 of the Award.\n\n499.\n\nIn my view, the Settlement Agreement has sought to settle the dispute underlying the First Arbitration rather than just the claims filed in that arbitration. This follows clearly from clauses 10, 11, 12, 27 of the Agreement which must be read in context.\n\n500.\n\nClause 10 extends the settlement to all *\"complaints and requests\"* contained in the Consent to Arbitrate....., in addition to *\"claims\".* Clause 11 settles the claims pending in the First Arbitration. Beyond these claims, clause 12 *\"acknowledge[s] the absence of any claims* *or misunderstandings.....as on the date of signing the Agreement\".* And pursuant to clause 27, the Agreement *\"supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings between* [the Parties] *with respect to the matters covered herein\".*\n\n501.\n\nThe Majority erroneously confines the effect of the Settlement Agreement to clause 11 above, disregarding the other clauses broadening the effect391.\n\nCf. paras. 12 - 23 supra.\n\n502.\n\nClause 12 above applies to the claims arisen in the Majority\u2019s decision during the Interregnum. These claims had effectively been waived. It is immaterial whether Claimant had known of such claims at that time. The sweeping acknowledgement of the *\"absence of any claim or misunderstanding\"* clearly expresses the Parties\u2019 common intent of clearing the desk as of the date of the Settlement Agreement, including any unknown incidents392\n\nThe issue is thus not one of Claimant\u2019s *\"acquiescence\"* with the allocations during the Interregnum as assumed by the Majority (para. 185 of the Award).\n\n503.\n\nClause 27 governs Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans. They have been pleaded and are accepted by the Majority on the basis of Claimant\u2019s negotiations and correspondence with the National Council in 1995- 1997393. This basis superseded by the Settlement Agreement and thus precluded from consideration in this arbitration. So are Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans as a consequence, however they might conceptually be related to Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations394.\n\nSee paras. 270, 271 of the First Decision and paras. 71-80 of the Award.\n\nI agree with the Majority that the Settlement Agreement could not *\"extinguish facts which have occurred\"* (para. 90 of the Award). However, the parties to the Agreement could agree, and have agreed, that former negotiations and correspondence shall henceforth play no role in the legal relations between them.\n\n506.\n\nThe Majority finally queries the nexus between my comments regarding the *\"contractual\"* and the procedural side of the Settlement Agreement395. The scope of the Settlement Agreement is determined through its interpretation as a contract between the parties thereto396. The *res judicata* effect of the Settlement Agreement flows from the latter\u2019s status as an \"award on agreed terms\". This effect precludes consideration in this arbitration of claims settled and facts superseded. Thus, the definition of such claims and facts (through interpretation of the Settlement Agreement) determines the scope of the (preclusive) *res judicata* effect of the Agreement.\n\nParas. 81, 84 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee paras. 18-33 supra.\n\n507.\n\nThe Majority interprets the scope of the Settlement Agreement narrower than provided by its terms and purpose. As a consequence, the Majority fails to give full credit to the Agreement\u2019s *res judicata* effect. The latter limits the powers of the Tribunal. By failing to recognize these limits, the Majority exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers397.\n\nCf. paras. 34 - 39 supra.\n\n**III.E. BIT PROTECTION COMPLEMENTING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nMy above comments on the preclusive effect of the Settlement Agreement rely primarily on the *ordinary meaning* of the latter\u2019s terms, owing to their clarity. In my view, the literal interpretation furthermore conforms to the *object* and *purpose* of the Settlement Agreement,398 as derived from its synallagma and background. The Majority\u2019s decision in my opinion defeats the *purpose* of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee paras. 24 - 30 supra.\n\n509.\n\nClaimant had expected (though not legitimately) to receive frequencies with sufficient power to achieve national coverage on a priority basis owing to the Settlement Agreement399. He has failed to negotiate the power of the frequencies under the Settlement Agreement, though, and the power of the frequencies received fell short of his aspirations. When he learned of the First Decision surprisingly declaring a liability of Respondent on account of the Interregnum, he hastened to claim that *\"a fraction of these 32 frequencies* [available for allocation to Gala] *would have enabled Claimant to achieve a full national network as of January 1, 2001\"400.*\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing Memorial, para. 57.12.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, para. 37.\n\n510.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Tribunal unanimously has dismissed Claimant\u2019s claim under the Settlement Agreement on account of the allegedly low power of the frequencies awarded401. However, in the Award, the Majority assumes an entitlement of Claimant under the FET standard to additional fourteen frequencies required for the full national network to complement the lower than expected power of the frequencies obtained pursuant to the Settlement Agreement402. This entitlement is construed on the basis of occurrences coterminus with the negotiation of the Settlement Agreement. And it assumes that, but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing, Gala would have received all frequencies needed for its aspired national network as of January 1, 2001, i.e., even before the time Gala received its frequencies pursuant to the Settlement Agreement in proper performance thereof403\n\nSee paras. 194- 199 of the First Decision.\n\nSee paras. 194 - 197 of the Award.\n\nSee paras. 180- 193 of the First Decision.\n\n511.\n\nIn the final analysis, the Majority construes Claimant\u2019s protection under the FET standard to the effect of complementing the Settlement Agreement. And it does this so perfectly to place Claimant in the same (or even better) legal and financial position in which he would have found himself had he successfully negotiated the powers of the frequencies specified in the Settlement Agreement and, as a consequence, prevailed with his claim for non-performance of the Agreement.\n\n512.\n\nI submit that the Majority in this way has achieved precisely the effect which the aforementioned provisions on the preclusive effect of the Settlement Agreement intended to avoid. They clearly served the purpose of preventing subsequent claims seeking *de facto* amendments of the Settlement Agreement. This purpose in my view is essential to the very function of the Agreement, i.e., to put at rest all grievances related to the dispute in the interest of legal certainty.\n\n513.\n\nI must hence confirm my previous conclusion that the Settlement Agreement precludes consideration of Claimant\u2019s initial business expansion plans in this arbitration.\n\n**IV. CLAIMANT\u2019S RECORD IN TENDERS**\n------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nThe Majority asserts that my comments on the First Decision\u2019s analysis and conclusions in point404 are based on the Third Witness Statement of Ihor Kurus submitted in the Second Phase of the proceedings, i.e., subsequent to the First Decision405\n\nSee paras. 318 - 331 of the First Decision and paras. 162-179 supra.\n\nPara. 96 and fn. 68 of the Award.\n\n515.\n\nHowever, all my arguments are based on submissions in the first phase of the proceedings, as the footnoted references show406. My arguments are:\n\n\u25a0 If the frequencies obtained pursuant to the Settlement Agreement are included in the record (what they should), Gala scored average success on its applications during 2001 - 2008407\n\n\u25a0 The National Council had to make its decisions in light of Gala\u2019s **recorded** capital and this was clearly inadequate408.\n\n\u25a0 Gala had failed to renew its program in response to changing market trends.409\n\nThe footnotes entail only cross-references to the Award and Mr. Kurus\u2019 witness statement, without relying on these sources (see fns. 140, 146, 148, 152 supra).\n\nPara. 168 and fn. 141 supra.\n\nPara. 172 supra.\n\nPara. 173 supra.\n\n516.\n\nUnlike suggested by the Majority410, these arguments are at most marginally related to the National Council\u2019s failure of reasoning its decisions411\n\nPara. 96 of the Award.\n\nin restating its arguments, the Majority refers to the Hearings on Remaining Issues after the First Decision (fn. 69 of the Award). See paras. 312 - 328 supra on the conclusiveness of these arguments.\n\n**V. INTERREGNUM**\n------------------\n\n517.\n\nThe Majority challenges my critique of its decision declaring the out-of-tender allocations of frequencies during the Interregnum in breach of the FET standard412 on three accounts, namely\n\n(A) my submission that the decision violates the principles of *\"ne ultra petita\" and \"audiatur et altera pars\"*413\n\n(B) my rebuttal of key assumptions of the Majority414; and\n\n(C) my comparison of the administrative practice during the Interregnum with Claimant\u2019s priority treatment under the Settlement Agreement415\n\nSee paras. 409 - 418 of the First Decision and paras. 180 - 227 supra.\n\nSee paras. 101 -104 of the Award and paras. 188- 199 supra.\n\nSee paras. 105-110 of the Award and paras. 192, 197- 199 supra.\n\nSee paras. 109-115 of the Award and paras. 200 - 212 supra.\n\n**V.A. NE ULTRA PETITA AND AUDIATUR ET ALTERA PARS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThe Majority contests my observation that Claimant has failed to plead a denial of frequencies during the Interregnum. As per the Majority, *\"there can thus be no doubt that, since his initial pleading, Claimant has continuously alleged that Respondent\u2019s denial of licences during the Interregnum period represented a violation of the BIT\"416.* This assertion is not confirmed by the pleadings referred to by the Majority.\n\nPara. 103 of the Award.\n\n519.\n\nThe Majority quotes para. 86 of Claimant\u2019s Memorial: *\"Respondent instead awarded the frequencies to other applicants (...) in doing so, Respondent breached the BIT (...)\"*417 This pleading does not relate to frequencies allotted during the Interregnum.\n\nPara. 103 and fns. 77, 78 of the Award.\n\n520.\n\nRather, the pleading relates to the period March 2000 to October 2002 while the Interregnum lasted from March 1999 to June 2000. Moreover, the pleading concerns Claimant\u2019s claim brought under the Settlement Agreement for Respondent\u2019s alleged failure of awarding Gala frequencies by May 15, 2000 in 9 of the 11 cities specified in the Agreement.418 Claimant submitted that *\"Respondent organized tenders for many* *frequencies in each of the 9 Cities. Gala participated in all of them, but received none of these frequencies\"*419\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Memorial, heading at p. 24 and para. 84.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 85.\n\n521.\n\nThe pleading referred to by the Majority thus concerns the award of frequencies in tenders in which Gala had participated. During the Interregnum, however, frequencies were allotted out-of-tender. These are not covered by the above pleading.\n\n522.\n\nThe Majority further refers to para. 67.3 of Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial. This pleading, as the aforementioned, relates to Respondent\u2019s actions or inactions in violation of the Settlement Agreement. Claimant has submitted that such actions or inactions have breached the FET standard in addition to the Settlement Agreement420. He has not pleaded, though, that occurrences during the Interregnum have violated Gala\u2019s right to apply for frequencies in addition to those specified in the Settlement Agreement.\n\nSee heading: *\"Respondent\u2019s Actions That Constitute A Breach Of The Settlement Agreement Also Constitute A Breach Of The Respondent\u2019s Obligations Under The BIT\" (Claimant\u2019s PHM, p. 51).*\n\n523.\n\nThe fact thus remains that Claimant has failed to plead any claim on account of the Interregnum practice. He has first asserted such a claim in response to the Majority\u2019s decision in point421. Such pleading cannot retroactively establish the procedural basis for the decision. Violating *ne ultra petita,* the decision in my view exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s power.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 32 - 37.\n\n524.\n\nAs regards *\"audiatur et altera pars\",* the Majority states that *\"Respondent had ample opportunity to counter these allegations (...) and did react, both before and after the First Decision\"422.* However, prior to the First Decision, Respondent did not address any claims regarding additional frequencies on account of the Interregnum; and he had no reason to do so since no such claims had been submitted by Claimant.\n\nPara. 103 of the Award and fn. 110.\n\n525.\n\nSuch claims were for the first time addressed in paras. 154 *et seq.* of Respondent\u2019s post-First Decision Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues in response to the Majority\u2019s surprise decision in point. The possibility of response after the decision on Respondent\u2019s liability, however, cannot ex *post facto* cure the violation of the *audiatur et altera pars* maxim. The process clearly departs from established rules of procedure423\n\nCf. paras. 191 - 199 supra.\n\n**V.B. ERRONEOUS KEY ASSUMPTIONS**\n----------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nThe Majority *\"ad argumendum\"* accepts Respondent\u2019s post-First Decision submission that pursuant the LTR in force at the time of the Interregnum, new tenders had been required for renewing expired licences to frequencies but that previous licence holders had enjoyed priority in such tenders. Yet, the Majority finds that only \"25 *of the 80 licences granted during the Interregnum corresponded to renewals upon expiration\".* The Majority sees *\"no reason to modify its conclusions\" (...) \"taking into account that more than 80 frequencies were* awarded\"during the Interregnum at variance with the LTR424.\n\nSee para. 109 of the Award. Cf. paras. 192 - 194 supra.\n\n527.\n\nHowever, the Majority\u2019s assumption that the renewals affected only 25 of the 80 frequencies awarded in total425 is inconsistent with the undisputed facts. These 25 frequencies related just to the tender of January 1, 2001 rather than to the total of 80 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum. This tender only concerned 25 frequencies where previous licences had expired. Thus, *\"all of the frequencies put to tender on January 1, 2001 concerned expired licenses\"426.*\n\nCf., however, para. 187 of the Award where the Majority states that \"*priority rights of previous broadcasters...only affected 31 frequencies\".*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, para. 181 and Third WS Kurus, paras. 6, 10.\n\n528.\n\nRespondent\u2019s pertinent submission is beyond dispute. As per Claimant\u2019s Counsel account, 38 of the 80 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum concerned locations not covered by Gala\u2019s existing frequencies. Out of these 38 frequencies, 31 corresponded to renewals of expired licences427.\n\nMr. Fouret, HTRI, p. 20.\n\n529.\n\nThe submissions and evidence referred to by the Majority thus fail to sustain the assumption that only 25 of the 80 frequencies allotted during the Interregnum were encumbered by priority rights of previous licence holders while some 65 could have been freely allocated to Gala. The referred evidence rather supports Respondent\u2019s submission that *\"most of these 80 frequencies corresponded to existing licences....which had* *expired...\"428.* And this evidence reinforces my doubts about the Majority\u2019s conclusion that Gala would, or just could, have received fourteen frequencies during the Interregnum if frequencies had been put up for tender in accordance with applicable law429.\n\nRespondent\u2019s CMRI, para. 174.\n\nCf. paras. 320 - 325 and 355 - 362 supra.\n\n**V.C. INTERREGNUM AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Majority takes issue with my proposition that Claimant pursuant to the Settlement Agreement benefited from an administrative practice similar to that during the Interregnum. As per the Majority, my point has not been pleaded, Claimant has received no privilege, and the award of frequencies to him on a priority basis just rebalanced an injustice done to Claimant430\n\nSee paras. 111-116 of the Award and paras. 205 - 212 supra.\n\n531.\n\nMy argument has been advanced by Respondent431.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues, para. 172.\n\n532.\n\nThe Majority concedes that Gala, by dint of the Settlement Agreement, has received eleven frequencies on a priority basis432. In a competitive tender, priority treatment accords the beneficiary a privilege over his contenders433\n\nPara. 113 of the Award: *\"The National Council eventually recognised Gala\u2019s priority position and granted Gala 11 broadcasting licences mentioned in Clause 13(b)...\".* See also paras. 182, 183 of the First Decision.\n\nIt is immaterial in my view that the wording of the Settlement Agreement thinly clothed Claimant\u2019s privilege to avoid an outright violation of Ukrainian law and possible claims of contenders placed at a disadvantage (cf. para. 113 of the Award). The priority was in fact granted as per Claimant\u2019s demand owing to the Settlement Agreement.\n\n533.\n\nThe priority granted to Gala impaired the opportunities of Gala\u2019s contenders for the frequencies concerned - similarly to the impairment of Gala\u2019s opportunities through out-of-tender allocations of frequencies during the Interregnum. An injustice done to Claimant cannot be rebalanced by doing injustice to Claimant\u2019s innocent contenders434\n\nSee paras. 207 - 209 supra.\n\n**VI. THE AWARD**\n-----------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Majority comments in footnotes on my Opinion regarding the Award. I will address only the comments regarding\n\n(A) Claimant\u2019s financial statements; and\n\n(B) European and German laws.\n\n**VI.A. CLAIMANT\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nThe Majority disagrees with my observation that Gala\u2019s profits and loss account were bound to be inaccurate due to Claimant\u2019s unrecorded \"investments\" in Gala and that Gala must have generated a net loss of some USD 2 million between 1995 and 2010 if these investments, as estimated by the Majority, are taken into account435.\n\nSee fns. 315, 332 of the Award and paras. 370 - 374 supra.\n\n536.\n\nAs submitted by Claimant and accepted by the Majority, Claimant during 1995 - 2010 had leased office space to Gala rent-free, paid equipment and licence fees of Gala out-of-pocket, and waived repayment of loans to Gala. These contributions into Gala were not recorded in Gala\u2019s financial statements. The Majority estimates their monetary value to cluster between USD 2 and 3 million.436\n\nSee paras. 120, 299 - 302 of the Award and Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Remaining Issues, paras. 12-22.\n\n537.\n\nSuch contributions have covered business expenses of Gala which would have had to be paid by Gala out of its cash flow had they not been covered by Claimant. The Majority has taken these contributions into account in order to assess the actual amount of *\"resources which Claimant brought into Ukraine\"* with a view to featuring *\"a common sense relationship\"* between Claimant\u2019s actual investments into Gala and the amount of foregone profits awarded. As a result, the Majority shows foregone profits awarded in an amount of about three times Claimant\u2019s total investment into Gala437.\n\nUSD 8,717,850 (loss awarded): 3,000,000 (max. actual Inv.)\n\n538.\n\nHad the Majority relied only on Claimant\u2019s recorded investment, i.e., USD 141,000, the loss of profits awarded would have been about 62 times Claimant\u2019s investment into Gala438, clearly showing anything but a *\"common sense relationship\"* and indicating an award of highly speculative, even exotic, profits.\n\nUSD 8,717,850 : 141,000\n\n539.\n\nRelating Claimant\u2019s estimated actual - rather than recorded - investments to the loss of profits awarded, the Majority must also relate Gala\u2019s actual past earnings to its estimated future earnings foregone by Claimant. The actual past earnings represent the balance between the sum of all actual investments into Gala and Gala\u2019s 2010 net enterprise value,i.e., the residual value of these investments439. Thus, investments totalling some USD 2 to 3 million compare with a residual (net enterprise) value of USD 126,290. This reflects an aggregate actual loss in excess of some USD 2 million for 1995 - 2010, i.e., the past lifetime of Claimant\u2019s investment in Gala440.\n\nAll earnings had undisputedly been retained in Gala.\n\nSee also para. 533 and fn. 297 supra.\n\n**VI.B. EUROPEAN AND GERMAN LAWS**\n----------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe Majority takes issue with my comments on the restrictions under European and German laws addressing recovery of damages in tender situations. It opines that these (1) restrictions are irrelevant to this arbitration since not pleaded, (2) EEC Directive 92/13 *\"does not limit the type of damages which can be awarded\",* and (3) para. 126 of the German *\"Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen\"* refers to recovery beyond *damnum emergens441.*\n\nSee fn. 322 of the Award.\n\n**VI.B.1. Not Pleaded**\n-----------------------\n\n541.\n\nThe mentioned EU and German laws have admittedly not been pleaded. They are quoted as reflections of recognized principles of law to be taken into account in interpreting international law principles of State responsibility which do not address tender situations442.\n\nSee paras. 272, 279 supra.\n\n**VI.B.2. EEC Directive 92/13**\n-------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nAs noted before, the Directive sets a minimum standard regarding the protection of bidders in flawed tenders443. This standard does not envision recovery of loss of profits. Article 2.1(d) of the Directive quoted by the Majority refers to laws of EU Member States (rather than other EU legislation). Member States may establish additional recovery rights but they are not required to include recovery of loss of profits444.\n\nSee para. 278 supra.\n\nSee paras. 274 - 278 supra.\n\n**VI.B.3. German Law**\n----------------------\n\n543.\n\nGerman law has been presented as an example of EU Member State laws which have both transformed the aforementioned EEC Directive into municipal law and, in addition, extended recovery to *lucrum cessans.* Para. 126 of the *\"Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen\"* concerns specifically recovery rights on account of flawed tenders. This cause of action itself is limited to *damnum emergens445.*\n\nSee paras. 280, 281 supra.\n\n544.\n\nThe reference in para. 126 above to further reaching recovery rights noted by the Majority concerns the provisions of the German Civil Code outlined supra446. These allow for recovery of *lucrum* cessansbut require for that purpose proof with a *\"probability bordering at certainty \"* that the claimant **would** (rather than could or should) have won the award if the tender had been carried out in due process.\n\nParas. 282, 283 supra.\n\n545.\n\nAs regards the Majority\u2019s suggestion that my restatement of European and German laws in point reflect my *\"personal unproven opinion\",* I refer to the authorities quoted supra447.\n\nSee fns. 215- 219 supra."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I.

PROCEDURE**\n-----------------\n\n**II.1. Registration of the Request**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nMr. Joseph Charles Lemire [\"Mr. Lemire\" or \"Claimant\"], a national of the United States, submitted his request for arbitration [the \"Request\"] against Ukraine [\"Respondent\"] to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes [\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\"] on September 11, 2006. The next day, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted copies thereof to Ukraine and its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n2.\n\nOn December 8, 2006, the Centre registered the Request, as supplemented by Claimant\u2019s submission of a letter dated November 14, 2006, and notified the parties of the registration, inviting them to constitute a tribunal.\n\n**II.2. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn February 8, 2007, 60 days after the registration of the Request, Claimant invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington on March 18, 1965, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 [\"ICSID Convention\"], and on February 22, 2007, appointed Mr. Jan Paulsson of France as arbitrator. On March 7, 2007, Respondent appointed Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss of Germany as arbitrator. Each of them had also been similarly appointed in the ICSID Additional Facility case *Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/l).\n\n4.\n\nAfter the passage of 90 days from the registration of the Request, Claimant invoked Article 38 of the ICSID Convention by letters of March 9, 2007 and March 20, 2007, requesting the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal. On June 6, 2007, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, in consultation with the parties, designated Professor Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto of Spain as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that the Tribunal had been constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1).\n\n**II.3. The Jurisdiction and Liability Phase**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal held its first session on July 23, 2007.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing the procedural calendar agreed at the first session, Claimant filed his Memorial on the Merits on November 12, 2007. Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on February 25, 2008 and Counter-Memorial on the Merits on February 26, 2008. Claimant filed observations on Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction on March 17, 2008.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal decided on March 26, 2008 to join jurisdiction to the merits.\n\n9.\n\nThe document production phase took place between March 26, 2008 and August 28, 2008.\n\n10.\n\nClaimant filed a request for provisional measures on August 15, 2008.\n\n11.\n\nClaimant filed his Reply on the Merits on August 20, 2008.\n\n12.\n\nOn August 29, 2008, Respondent filed a proposal for the disqualification of Mr. Jan Paulsson as arbitrator, and the proceedings were suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). On September 2, 2008, Respondent filed observations on Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures. On September 10, 2008, Claimant filed a response to Respondent\u2019s observations on Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures.\n\n13.\n\nOn September 23, 2008, the other members of the Tribunal, Prof. Juan Fern\u00e4ndez-Armesto and Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss dismissed the proposal for disqualification of Mr. Paulsson. The suspension of the proceedings was lifted on the same day. On October 22, 2008, Claimant withdrew the request for provisional measures of August 15, 2008.\n\n14.\n\nOn November 6, 2008, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n15.\n\nOn November 19, 2008, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference by telephone with the parties, and on December 3, 2008 a further similar conference was held.\n\n16.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place on December 8 through 12, 2008.\n\n17.\n\nThe parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs [\"PHB\"] on March 4, 2009 and simultaneous statements of costs on March 20, 2009.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability on January 14, 2010.\n\n**II.4. The Remaining Issues Phase**\n------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn February 1, 2010, the Tribunal proposed to hold a consultation with the parties for the purposes of discussing the continuation of the procedure. By separate letters of February 11, 2010 from Claimant and February 12, 2010 from Respondent, the parties agreed to the Tribunal\u2019s proposal.\n\n20.\n\nOn March 1, 2010, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the parties and, on March 4, 2010, issued Procedural Order No. 2, setting out the procedural calendar for the remainder of the proceeding.\n\n21.\n\nOn April 16, 2010, Claimant filed his Memorial on Remaining Issues [\"CMRI\"]. On June 21, 2010, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Remaining Issues [\"RMRI\"]. Each contained submissions with regard to costs.\n\n22.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal\u2019s direction in Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent submitted its document production request to Claimant on April 26, 2010, *i.e.* in the first 10 days of the allotted time period for the preparation of its Counter-Memorial. Claimant delivered the documents with comments on May 11, 2010, *i.e.,* within 15 days of the request.\n\n23.\n\nOn May 17, 2010, the deadline for the document production phase to be finalized, Respondent submitted observations on Claimant\u2019s production and reserved its rights to request the Tribunal\u2019s assistance in obtaining documents alleged missing in Claimant\u2019s production.\n\n24.\n\nOn July 2, 2010, the President of the Tribunal acting on behalf of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference by telephone with the parties to discuss procedural matters relevant to the hearing. Minutes of points covered and agreements reached were circulated to the parties on July 8, 2010.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, the Tribunal held a hearing on Remaining Issues at the World Bank offices in Paris. Attending the hearing were:\n\n**The Tribunal**\n\nProf. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, President of the Tribunal   \nMr. Jan Paulsson   \nDr. J\u00fcrgen Voss\n\n**The ICSID Secretariat**\n\nMs. A\u00efssatou Diop, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n**Participating on behalf of Claimant**\n\nMr. Joseph Charles Lemire, Claimant  \nMr. Sergey Denisenko, Technical Director of CJSC \"Radiocompany Gala\" [\"Gala Radio\"]  \nMr. Hamid G.

Both parties declared that they had no objections to assert1.\n\nTranscript of the Hearing on Remaining Issues that took place on July 12, 2010 [\"HTRI\"], p. 274.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated to the parties and Tribunal members an audio recording made of the entire hearing.\n\n28.\n\nOn August 6 and 9, 2010, Claimant and Respondent, respectively, filed their final submission on costs.\n\n**III. THE FIRST DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n**III.1 Introduction**\n----------------------\n\n29.\n\nClaimant originally submitted this dispute to ICSID invoking:\n\n- the Treaty between the United States of America and Ukraine Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, done in Kyiv on October 17, 1996, which entered into force on November 16, 1996 [the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"]; Article VI of the BIT entitles any national of a State party to the BIT to submit to ICSID any dispute with the other State party to the BIT relating to either *\"an investment agreement between that Party and such national\"* or *\"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\";* and\n\n- an agreement between Claimant and Respondent on the settlement of a dispute, dated March 20, 2000 [the \"Settlement Agreement\"], which was recorded as an award on agreed terms on September 18, 2000 (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)98/1).\n\n30.\n\nOn January 14, 2010 the Arbitral Tribunal issued a \"Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\" [the \"First Decision\"], in which the Tribunal:\n\n- partially accepted Claimant\u2019s First Allegation *(\"The Violation of the FET Standard in the Awarding of Frequencies\")* and concluded that Respondent\u2019s practice regarding the allocation of radio frequencies was not compatible with the Fair and Equitable Treatment [\"FET\"] standard defined in the BIT2;\n\n- analysed Claimant\u2019s Second Allegation (\"The *Continuous Harassment by Respondent and the Request for Moral Damages\")* and decided that the decision of whether the facts of the case constitute *\"exceptional circumstances\"*, which merit the awarding of moral damages, would be decided in this award [this \"Award\" or the \"Final Award\"]3; and\n\n- dismissed all other contentions of Claimant.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 451.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 486.\n\n31.\n\nThe relevant findings with respect to the First and Second Allegations were summarized in the First Decision:\n\nFirst Allegation4\n\n*\"419. As a starting point the Tribunal has studied the administrative procedure defined in Ukrainian Law for the issuance of radio frequencies. The conclusion reached by the Tribunal is that the* *procedure was marred by significant shortcomings (although these have been ameliorated after the 2006 amendment to the LTR). These weaknesses facilitated arbitrary or discriminatory decision-taking by the National Council.*\n\n*420. In six years Gala Radio, although it tried insistently, and presented more than 200 applications for all types of frequencies, was only able to secure a single licence (in a small village in rural Ukraine). Gala\u2019s main competitors were much more successful and each received between 38 and 56 frequencies. Although this macro-statistical analysis does not provide conclusive evidence that Respondent, when awarding radio licences, has been violating the FET standard, there are factors (the strikingly different success rates of Gala and of its competitors, the inexistence of any information regarding the real owners of the competing stations, the impossibility of verifying the reasons why Gala was rejected) which can be construed as indications that at least some of the decisions of the National Council when it awarded frequencies were arbitrary and/or discriminatory.*\n\n*421. To confirm or reject these indications, the Tribunal then looked in detail at five tenders for radio frequencies and at the administrative practice for awarding licences in the interregnum while the National Council was not operative between 1999 and 2000. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the following decisions did not meet the FET standard provided for in the BIT:*\n\n*- the National Council\u2019s decision adopted on October 19, 2005 granting an FM information channel to Radio Era, and the subsequent decisions to award 12 frequencies to radio Kokannya;*\n\n*- the National Council\u2019s decision of May 26, 2004 denying Gala Radio the licence for an AM channel, and the decision of December 21, 2004 granting such licence to NART TV;*\n\n*- the National Council\u2019s decision of February 6, 2008 denying Gala\u2019s application and accepting the application of Kiss Radio;*\n\n*- Respondent\u2019s practice of awarding radio licences while the National Council\u2019s was not operative between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000, and the National Council\u2019s decision of January 1, 2001 to legalize the licences illegally granted during the interregnum.*\n\n*422. On the other hand, the Tribunal is unconvinced by Claimant\u2019s allegation that the National Council\u2019s decisions of November 20, 2002 and of October 19, 2005 represented a breach of the FET standard/*\n\nSecond Allegation\n\n*\"484. The Tribunal has analyzed in detail the relationship between Gala Radio and the National Council and certain facts stand out:*\n\n*- Gala was never inspected until 2005, and in the next three years it was the object of five inspections, of which four were unscheduled;*\n\n*- the first warning issued by the National Council against Gala was clearly abusive, and was correctly set aside by the Ukrainian Courts;*\n\n*- the second warning was issued for alleged infractions which to an impartial bystander look petty; this warning was again set aside by the Courts;*\n\n*- the draft resolution of the National Council proposed the issuance of a third warning, and Chairman Shevchenko voted in favour; the underlying inspection report showed that most of the infractions which led to the second warning had been cured, and only found some very minor infringements;*\n\n*- the third warning was rejected, but the National Council adopted a decision which seemed to imply that Mr. Lemire, as an American, was prohibited by law from being the rightful owner of Gala;*\n\n*- the facts which led to the 2008 inspection probably did not merit the commencement of an inspection procedure, since similar actions had been committed by other TV and radio stations, which were not inspected;*\n\n*- Gala\u2019s application for extension of its licence was delayed in comparison with other applications; it was approved in the same session when the National Council approved a 10 fold increase in the renewal fees.*\n\n*485. If these facts are added to the National Council\u2019s rejection of all (bar one) of Gala\u2019s applications for new licences, the resulting overall picture is that Gala has received a one-sided treatment from its regulator. Gala\u2019s reaction, consisting in a vehement defence of its rights, presence of US Embassy officials, protest before the National Council and successive appeals to the Ukrainian Courts, seem to have exacerbated the National Council\u2019s stance\".*\n\nFootnotes omitted.\n\n**III.2. The Separate Opinion**\n-------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal adopted its First Decision regarding jurisdiction and liability *\"unanimously as regards Section I through VI, and by majority as regards some aspects and conclusions of Section VII* Section VII was devoted to *\"Alleged Violations of the BIT/* During the deliberation phase of this Final Award Arbitrator Dr. J\u00fcrgen Voss [\"Dr. Voss\"] has seen fit to append a lengthy separate dissenting opinion [the \"Separate Opinion\"], identifying propositions and conclusions to which he could not assent both in the First Decision and in the present Award. He comes to the conclusion that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers and that there has been a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure.\n\n33.\n\nSince Dr. Voss\u2019 detailed comments with regard to the First Decision did not emerge until the deliberation of this Final Award, the Arbitral Tribunal could not react to them in the First Decision. This Final Award will, consequently, start with a concise section, explaining why Dr. Voss\u2019 opinion with regard to the First Decision has not persuaded the Tribunal to resile from the norms which it believes should guide its decision, nor from the conclusions derived from them. This section will cover (1) Claimant\u2019s legal standing, (2) the definition of the FET Standard, (3) Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations and (4) Claimant\u2019s record in tenders. Comments to Dr. Voss\u2019 submissions regarding the present Award will be inserted as footnotes where appropriate in the text of this document.\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s legal standing**\n--------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nDr. Voss submits that *\"without offering an explanation\"* the First Decision disregards Gala\u2019s and Mirakom\u2019s5 legal personalities, piercing their corporate veils, and attributing Gala\u2019s rights under Ukrainian legislation to Claimant in his capacity as a United States [\"US\"] investor in Ukraine6. In Dr. Voss\u2019 opinion, the BIT does not extend its protection to shareholder derivative suits, and no established principle for piercing Gala\u2019s veil applies to the case7. To the contrary: in Dr. Voss\u2019 opinion, Gala\u2019s corporate veil is imposed on Claimant by Ukrainian law (which limits the participation of foreigners in the radio industry to acting as shareholders) and under the reservation made by Ukraine in Section 3 of the Annex to the BIT8. He submits that Claimant cannot on the one hand hide behind Gala\u2019s corporate personality for purposes of the Ukrainian sector legislation, while simultaneously on the other hand portraying himself as Gala\u2019s *alter ego* in order to invoke the BIT9.\n\nCJSC \"Mirakom Ukraina\".\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 63.\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 64 to 78.\n\nSection 4 of the Annex to the BIT: \"3. *Ukraine reserves the right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment, as provided in Article II, paragraph 1, in the sectors or matters it has indicated below:*  \n*Production of equipment used exclusively for nuclear power plants; maritime transportation including ocean and coastal shipping; air transportation; nuclear electric energy generation; privatization of those educational, sports, medical and scientific facilities financed by the national budget; mining of salt; mining and processing of rare earth, and of uranium and other radioactive elements; ownership and operation of television and radio broadcasting stations; and ownership of land.\"*\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 93.\n\n35.\n\nThe Separate Opinion concludes that all of Claimant\u2019s claims should have been dismissed *in limine,* because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae10* to decide a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit, and that the First Decision and the Award exceeded the Tribunal\u2019s powers11.\n\n*Sic.*\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 103 to 105.\n\n36.\n\nDr. Voss\u2019 point was conceived by him alone; it was never pleaded by Respondent.\n\n37.\n\nRespondent did present and argue a number of jurisdictional objections. On February 25, 2008, it submitted a Memorial in Support of its Objections to Jurisdiction, which included six separate objections. These arguments were further developed in Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder12 and analysed and decided in the First Decision. The argument that shareholder derivative suits are inadmissible under the BIT was not among them.\n\nParas. 146 to 256.\n\n38.\n\nIf, on the basis of a jurisdictional objection never articulated by Respondent nor therefore answered by Claimant, the Tribunal had dismissed the arbitration, it would indeed have seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure.\n\n39.\n\nInadmissible as a matter of procedure, Dr. Voss\u2019 argument is also flawed in substance. Article I.1(a) of the BIT protects *\"every kind of investment in the territory of one Party, owned or controlled* *directly or indirectly* *by nationals or companies of the other Party\"13.* Indirect investments, as the one held by Claimant, are included within the scope of protection of the BIT.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n**2. The Definition of the FET Standard**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Separate Opinion submits14 that the circumstances of the case, and specifically the fact that frequencies are awarded through public tenders, require that a specially restrictive interpretation of the FET Standard be applied, and that a violation would only exist if:\n\n- Claimant is directly affected in his rights as foreign investor;\n\n- Gala\u2019s treatment is linked to Claimant\u2019s capacity as a foreign investor;\n\n- Gala\u2019s treatment is captured by an established category of the FET Standard, notably, denial of justice;\n\n- the treatment amounts to denial of justice or is so egregious as to amount to a breach of the minimum standard of customary international law.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 148.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal has already explained in its First Decision15 the general scope and proper interpretation of the FET standard as defined in the BIT. It has addressed all arguments submitted by the parties and sees no reason to amend its opinion or expand its reasoning. The Separate Opinion, however, submits certain new arguments, which were never pleaded in the case, and the Tribunal, consequently, never had the opportunity of expressing its opinion; it will do so, as concisely as feasible, in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 243 *et seq.*\n\n42.\n\nBefore doing so, the Tribunal has to dispel a misconception that appears repeatedly in Dr. Voss\u2019 Separate Opinion16. Dr. Voss states that the FET standard *\"cannot be interpreted as an \"umbrella clause \"* ipso iure *elevating violations of tender rules to international delicts\".* He seems to imply that the Tribunal is in disagreement with this principle. In fact, the Tribunal agrees. Dr. Voss adds that the FET standard cannot be construed as *\"an empowerment of tribunals* ex aequo et bono *to develop a case law superseding host countries\u2019 administrative laws\"17.* The Tribunal concurs.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 128.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 449.\n\n43.\n\nBut neither the First Decision nor this Award have ever stated that violations of tender rules *ipso iure* amount to international wrongs, nor has the Tribunal ever assumed that it enjoys *ex aequo et bono* powers to disregard Ukrainian administrative law. Quite the contrary. As the First Decision stated, *\"not every violation of domestic law necessarily translates into an arbitrary or discriminatory measure under international law and a violation of the FET Standard\"18*. For this to happen, it is necessary that the State incurs in *\"a blatant disregard of applicable tender rules, distorting fair competition among tender participants\"19.* And this is what has occurred: the First Decision found that on four occasions (three tenders plus an administrative practice) Ukraine indeed acted in *\"blatant disregard of applicable tender rules\"20.*\n\nFirst Decision, para. 385.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 385.\n\nSee para. 31 *supra.*\n\n**2.1. The Annex to the BIT and its Importance for Interpreting the FET Standard**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe main argument with which Dr. Voss supports his restrictive interpretation of the FET standard is by advocating an extensive application of the exception contained in the Annex to the BIT21. This exception reads as follows:\n\n*\"3. Ukraine reserves the right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment, as provided in Article II, paragraph 1, in the sectors or matters it has indicated below:*\n\n*Production of equipment used exclusively for nuclear power plants; maritime transportation including ocean and coastal shipping; air transportation; nuclear electric energy generation; privatization of those educational, sports, medical and scientific facilities financed by the national budget; mining of salt; mining and processing of rare earth, and of uranium and other radioactive elements;*  *ownership and operation of television and radio broadcasting stations;* *and ownership of land\"22.*\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 137.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n45.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Dr. Voss\u2019 argument lacks merit, (A) because the scope of the exception is limited to the national treatment principle, and (B) because application of the exception requires prior notification, and there is no evidence that such requirement has been complied with.\n\n**A. The Scope of the Exception**\n---------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn the Annex to the BIT, both the US and Ukraine reserved the right *\"to make or maintain limited exceptions to* *national treatment* *\"23,* in the *\"ownership and operation of radio stations\".* The literality of the Treaty does not leave room for doubt: the parties can make or maintain exceptions, but the scope of these limitations must be restricted to the principle of national treatment. This conclusion is confirmed by the definition of national treatment contained in Article II. 1:\n\n*\"Each Party shall permit and treat investment and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies...* *subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex of the Treaty* *\"24.*\n\nArticle II. 1 is thus structured as a general principle, subject to an exception (for investment in listed sectors and matters). It strengthens the literal interpretation of the Annex: the exception is linked to the national treatment principle.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n47.\n\nMoreover: only Article II. 1 (the rule defining national treatment) includes a reference to the exception for investments in protected sectors or matters. Article II.3 (which defines the FET standard) lacks any similar reference. The difference in the drafting of both sections of Article II reinforces once more the literal interpretation of the Annex: the exception can only be applied in the context of national treatment - not with regard to FET. And since the Tribunal\u2019s findings in the First Decision are based on a violation of the FET standard, the exception contained in the Annex to the BIT is irrelevant.\n\n**B. Procedural Requirements**\n------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThere is an autonomous reason why the exception contained in the Annex can have no impact in this case: a State\u2019s right to make or maintain exceptions to the national treatment in protected sectors is not unlimited, but subject to specific notification requirements; Art. II. 1. provides:\n\n*\"Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of entry into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Annex. Moreover, each Party agrees to notify the other of any future exception... and to limit such exceptions to a minimum\".*\n\n49.\n\nPrevious notification of limiting laws and regulations is not simply a formality: it is a fundamental requirement in order to guarantee that investors enjoy legal certainty, and that States cannot invoke the exception *ex post facto,* surprising the investor\u2019s good faith.\n\n50.\n\nHas Ukraine notified the US of any laws or regulations concerning the radio sector? Respondent has never argued the existence of such notification, and there is no evidence in the file showing that it has taken place. Consequently, it is legitimate to proceed on the basis that no such notification took place.\n\n51.\n\nNon-compliance with the procedural safeguards included in the BIT is a final factor reinforcing the conclusion that the exceptions mentioned in the Annex have no bearing whatsoever for the resolution of the present dispute.\n\n**2.2. The Alleged Privilege Enjoyed by Protected Foreign Contenders**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nDr. Voss submits that equal treatment between participants is pivotal to the fairness and effectiveness of a tender process25.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 117.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees.\n\n54.\n\nBut Dr. Voss goes on to reason that where protected foreign investors compete in tender proceedings with domestic investors and with other foreign investors without BIT protection, they enjoy a privilege. In Dr. Voss\u2019 opinion, BIT protection thus undermines the integrity of the tender process26.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 120.\n\n55.\n\nHere, the Tribunal disagrees.\n\n56.\n\nWhen agreeing to BITs, States confer rights to foreign investors, which are unavailable to their own citizens. Most jurisdictions deny local investors, who have suffered unfair or inequitable treatment at the hands of their own authorities, a specific cause of action. Municipal law typically restricts remedies to the annulment of administrative acts, to the declaration, under limited circumstances, of the public administration\u2019s tort liability or to the right to compensation in certain cases of expropriation.\n\n57.\n\nForeign investors covered by a BIT enjoy an additional level of protection: they can avail themselves of the same instruments open to local investors, and additionally they can draw protection from the international law rights conferred by the treaty. The different treatment between foreign and domestic investors is a natural consequence of a BIT. However, this unequal treatment is not without justification: justice is not to grant everyone the same, but *swum cuique tribuere.* Foreigners, who lack political rights, are more exposed than domestic investors to arbitrary actions of the host State and may thus, as a matter of legitimate policy, be granted a wider scope of protection.\n\n58.\n\nThe facts proven in the present case are a good example of the role played by BITs.\n\nRole of the BIT\n---------------\n\n59.\n\nWhen in the 1990s Mr. Lemire proposed to invest in Ukraine in a then unexplored sector - that of commercial radio, traditionally dominated by State owned stations - he was received with open arms and authorised to buy a local radio station. Claimant quickly developed his venture and became one of the leading broadcasters in the Kyiv area. But then local, better connected groups became aware of the opportunities. Gala\u2019s main competitors, controlled by powerful Ukrainian investors, were each able to obtain from the National Council between 38 and 56 additional frequencies, while Gala, although it tried incessantly, and presented more than 200 applications, was only able to secure a single licence (in a small village in rural Ukraine).\n\n60.\n\nRadio channels can be divided into two basic categories: those which fundamentally broadcast music and those which fundamentally broadcast information. The first are of limited political relevance. Informational channels, however, are politically more sensitive, because they are important elements for the formation of public opinion27.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 332.\n\n61.\n\nGala Radio was and is predominantly a music broadcaster, although it also broadcasts news. On at least two occasions, Gala tried to obtain the necessary authorisations to create a second channel, devoted to informational broadcasting. The first was the AM tender of May 26, 2004, and the second a specific tender for 15 FM frequencies reserved for informational radio held on October 19, 200528. Both tenders had a high political importance: the AM tender, because it covered the entire Ukrainian territory; the FM tender, because it would allow the winner to create a nationwide information radio channel. On both occasions, Gala\u2019s bid was rejected, and the frequencies concerned awarded to close political friends of President Viktor Yuschenko. In the case of the AM frequency, this happened after declaring the first tender void and retendering the frequency. In the case of the FM frequency, Claimant was able to trace and submit in evidence a written \"Instruction\", signed by the President of Ukraine himself and directed to the National Council, expressing his expectations that the frequencies be awarded to Radio Era, a company controlled by Deputy Derkach, a close political ally29.\n\nFirst Decision, para 370.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 351.\n\n62.\n\nThe President of Ukraine interfered in this administrative procedure, not once, but twice: first by sending an \"Instruction\" to the National Council, indicating the recipients of the frequencies, and then by having one member of his staff follow up on the Instruction and enquire about the results. The interference must be deemed wilful, because the President knew - or should have known - that the National Council was an independent agency, under a legal obligation to decide tenders impartially, in accordance with the process and criteria prescribed by the law, and that his interference was subverting that legal order30.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 342.\n\n63.\n\nThe significance of the President\u2019s interference is magnified by the powers which he held at that time. The members of the National Council could at any time be removed from office by a decision of the President or of the Parliament31. There was an unspoken but evident threat in the messages from the President and his staff: if the licences were not awarded to the radio stations indicated by the President, the tenure of the National Council members was threatened. The National Council duly granted the licences to the radio channels indicated in the presidential Instruction.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 290.\n\n64.\n\nThe weaknesses in the Ukrainian legal procedure for the issuance of radio frequencies and the lack of transparency in the administrative procedures resulted in an arbitrary advantage to local investors with greater political clout. It is not true, as Dr. Voss assumes, that *\"at most, Gala suffered a* \"reverse discrimination\" *alongside with several domestically-owned contenders in each instance\"32.* Domestically owned radio companies eventually obtained the number of licences required to create nation-wide radio channels. Mr. Lemire, precisely because he was a foreigner and lacked the close political connections that the Ukrainian media groups had, was pushed aside and deprived of the opportunity to compete with local investors on a level playing field.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para 460.\n\n65.\n\nUnder these circumstances, application of the BIT has not resulted - contrary to Dr. Voss\u2019 assertions - in any privilege in favour of Claimant. What the Treaty has achieved is the reestablishment of a level playing field, which had been tilted against the foreign investor. Gala was competing against domestic players who were able to use their preferential relationship with the public administration and the regulators to their own advantage. The effect of the application of the BIT is to redress a situation of discrimination - it does not create any privilege. To affirm the contrary, as the Separate Opinion does, is to confuse the victim with the offender.\n\nInterpretation of the BIT\n-------------------------\n\n66.\n\nDr. Voss adds that BIT protection in tender processes, since it could lead to an unjustified privilege in favour of foreign investors, should be construed narrowly33. The Tribunal disagrees. There is nothing in the text of the BIT which supports this conclusion. The BIT must be construed, like any other treaty, in accordance with the principles set forth in the Vienna Convention.\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 127 and 128.\n\n**3. Legitimate Expectations**\n------------------------------\n\n**3.1. Definition of Legitimate Expectations and of Gala\u2019s Business Expansion Plans**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Separate Opinion includes an extensive section criticising the conclusions established in the First Decision regarding Mr. Lemire\u2019s legitimate expectations and Gala\u2019s business expansion plans34. In order to address this criticism, it is necessary, as a first step, to recapitulate how these matters were treated in the First Decision.\n\nSeparate Opinion paras. 8 to 60.\n\nLegitimate Expectations\n-----------------------\n\n68.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Tribunal referred to legitimate expectations in the course of its interpretation of Article II.3 of the BIT35. In the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, legitimate expectations play a subsidiary role as a normative criterion36. The cornerstone of the Tribunal\u2019s findings was the law, and specifically the FET standard enshrined in Article II.3 of the BIT. It is worth remembering that legitimate expectations are nowhere mentioned in that article, nor anywhere else in the BIT.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 264.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 257.\n\n69.\n\nTreaties must be interpreted in accordance with the Vienna Convention. Article 31.1 of this Convention provides that terms used in a treaty must be construed *\"in their context\".* For this purpose, the Tribunal resorted to the Preamble of the BIT, which establishes *\"that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment...\"* and concluded that the FET standard was closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations. The Tribunal then went on to analyse what gives rise to investors\u2019 legitimate expectations, and came to the conclusion that these expectations can be defined on a general and on a specific level:\n\n- On a general level, the Tribunal found that Claimant was entitled to expect that the Ukrainian regulatory system for the broadcasting industry would be consistent, transparent, fair, reasonable, and enforced without arbitrary or discriminatory decisions37;\n\n- More particularly, Mr. Lemire had the legitimate expectation that Gala, which at the time was only a local station in Kyiv, would be allowed to expand on its own merits, in parallel with the growth of the private radio industry in Ukraine38.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 267.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 268.\n\n70.\n\nThese legitimate expectations were not based on an individual negotiation between Mr. Lemire and the Ukrainian State; they represent the common level of legal comfort which any protected foreign investor in the radio sector could expect.\n\nGala\u2019s Business Expansion Plans\n-------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe First Decision then went on to analyse the related matter of Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial business plans. This was much discussed by the parties, because Claimant was not able to produce a formal business plan. From circumstantial evidence, the Tribunal concluded that his initial plans had been to convert Gala into a national broadcaster and to create a second AM channel, and that the Ukrainian authorities were informed of his plans39.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 270.\n\n72.\n\nLegitimate expectations and Gala\u2019s initial business plans are thus separate concepts:\n\n- one concept is constituted by Mr. Lemire\u2019s expectations regarding the protection afforded by the Ukrainian regulatory system and the possibility of expanding Gala on its own merits and under the same terms and conditions as the private radio industry in Ukraine; these legitimate expectations are a criterion which the Tribunal used to construe the meaning of Article II.3 of the BIT;\n\n- a separate concept are the actual business plans which Claimant had at the time when he made his initial investment, *i.e.* whether he envisaged to create a local or a nationwide radio channel, whether his plans also included the incorporation of additional channels, and whether the authorities were aware of these projects; this issue is relevant for the calculation of the damage suffered by Claimant because it defines Gala\u2019s \"but for\" scenario40, but it has no direct bearing on Mr. Lemire\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\nSee para. 253 *infra.*\n\n73.\n\nThe Separate Opinion disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s findings, because (3.2.) Dr. Voss rejects the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of evidence, and (3.3.) because he submits that the initial business plans were affected by the Settlement Agreement.\n\n**3.2. Assessment of Evidence Regarding Gala\u2019s Planned Expansion**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nDr. Voss disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of evidence regarding Gala\u2019s business expansion plans41, because he attaches more weight to Mr. Petrenko\u2019s witness statement, and less to that of Mr. Lemire\u2019s, and because he induces certain consequences from a particular reading of two administrative letters42.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 46.\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 47 to 50.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal will not engage in a detailed analysis or evaluation of Dr. Voss\u2019 assessment of the evidence. But a few remarks are needed.\n\n76.\n\nMr. Lemire affirmed in his witness statement that his initial plan, when he entered into the radio industry, was to have two national FM broadcasters, with distinct music programming targeted at different age ranges, and a talk radio. According to Mr. Lemire, these plans were included in a business plan which he submitted to Respondent43. Mr. Lemire went on to explain that, in his meetings with Mr. Petrenko (the Chairman of the National Council) he was advised to buy an existing radio company in Kyiv - that became Gala Radio - and was assured that it would be allowed to expand and create the envisaged additional networks. Mr. Lemire explained that he asked Mr. Petrenko to give him some written assurance. Mr. Lemire alleged that the July 18, 1995, letter signed by Mr. Petrenko and addressed to the State Committee [the \"July 18, 1995, Letter\"]44 is written proof of such assurances45.\n\nHearing Transcript of the hearing on jurisdiction and merits that took place on December 8 to 12, 2008 [\"HT\"], Day 1, pp. 121 and 122.\n\nDoe. CM-1\n\nWitness Statement [\"WS\"] of Mr. Lemire, para. 17.\n\n77.\n\nMr. Petrenko, on the other hand, confirmed that he met with Mr. Lemire two or three times during this period, but otherwise rejects having ever made any promises or assurances as regards the expansion of Gala Radio. Mr. Petrenko explains that the only purpose of the July 18, 1995, Letter was to check with the State Committee on the availability of certain frequencies46. And that the October 18, 1995, response from the State Committee47 does no more than confirm such availability48.\n\nWS (Rebuttal) of Mr. Petrenko, paras. 25 *et seq.*\n\nDoe. CM-2.\n\nWS (Rebuttal) of Mr. Petrenko, paras. 30 *et seq.*\n\n78.\n\nIn fact, the July 18, 1995, Letter was signed by Mr. Petrenko as the Chairman of the National Council and addressed to the Chairman of the State Inspection on Electronic Communications. Chairman Petrenko indicates in his letter that the National Council is considering the possibility to issue a licence to Gala Radio and expressly asks the State Inspection to *\"consider the possibility to give the company stated above* [*i.e.* Gala Radio] *the frequency channels for establishing radio broadcasting service according to their license application in the following cities*... \". The letter then mentions 12 cities for the FM band and Kyiv for the AM band, and defines the power allocation for each station. Claimant has argued that the frequencies and power mentioned in this letter would allow for national coverage49. Respondent has not denied it. The Arbitral Tribunal views this letter as clear proof that Mr. Lemire planned to build a FM national broadcaster and an AM channel, and that Respondent was aware of it. Since Claimant has not been able to produce his business plan50, there is not sufficient evidence, apart from Mr. Lemire\u2019s statement, that his plans also included a second FM network, and that Respondent was aware of it.\n\nClaimant\u2019s PHB, para. 57.12.\n\nHT,Day 1, pp. 122 and 128.\n\n79.\n\nDr. Voss has argued that the answer from the State Committee does not mention the AM channel, and that this is evidence against the inclusion of the AM channel among the initial investment plans of Claimant51. It is true that the October 18, 1995 letter from the State Committee does *\"recommend\"* high powered FM frequencies for 11 of the 12 cities applied for by Claimant, but that it does not mention any AM channel. There is no evidence in the file to clarify the State Committee\u2019s position with regard to the availability of an AM frequency. But even if *arguendo* the Tribunal accepted that the AM frequency was not available, that fact would not change the Tribunal\u2019s conviction that Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial business plan included the creation of an AM band and that Respondent was aware of it, and that its initial reaction was positive - it would just show that while the FM frequencies were immediately available, it is uncertain whether AM frequencies were available at that moment.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 48.\n\n80.\n\nSumming up, after having heard the oral evidence of both Mr. Lemire and of Mr. Petrenko and carefully weighed the documentary evidence, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial plans when he bought into Gala Radio in June 1995 were to create an FM national broadcaster, for music format, plus a second AM channel, for talk radio52.\n\nThe discussion of whether Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial plans were limited to creating a single national broadcaster (as Dr. Voss asserts), or also included a second AM channel (as the Tribunal concluded), is in any event irrelevant for the purpose of calculating the amount of compensation due to Claimant: the Tribunal will establish Claimant\u2019s damages assuming the so called Scenario II, which foresees Gala Radio simply as a national broadcaster, without an AM channel. Whether Mr. Lemire planned or did not plan the AM channel, and whether the authorities knew or ignored it, therefore has no impact whatsoever on the quantum of damages.\n\n**3.3. Effect of the Settlement Agreement on Gala\u2019s Initial Business Plans**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nDr. Voss opines that the Tribunal by building its Award on Claimant\u2019s business expansion plans, without considering the impact of the Settlement Agreement, fails to recognize the *res iudicata* effect of the ICSID award which formalizes the Settlement Agreement and manifestly exceeds its powers53. Towards the end of the Separate Opinion Dr. Voss reprises the same issue, but on this occasion, the reasoning provided is of a contractual nature: in his opinion, the Settlement Agreement constitutes a waiver of any claims on account of the allocation of frequencies before the Settlement Agreement, and precludes consideration of all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings54.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 39.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 502.\n\n82.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with both of Dr. Voss\u2019 formulations.\n\n83.\n\nAs a first step, it is important to briefly recall what the Tribunal has actually decided. In the First Decision, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that three tenders for the allocation of licences and the administrative practice followed by Ukraine during the Interregnum (which lasted from March 16, 1999, through June 9, 2000, and then led to a regularization of the frequencies irregularly awarded on January 1, 2001) did not meet the FET standard provided for in the BIT55. And in this Award, the Tribunal will establish the appropriate compensation, by comparing Gala\u2019s \"as is\" value **(i.e.** what Gala is now worth), with Gala\u2019s \"but for\" value **(i.e.** what Gala would be worth, if no violation of the BIT had taken place)56. In order to establish the \"but for\" value, the Tribunal will assume that Gala would have become a national broadcaster and would have created a second AM channel, as Mr. Lemire foresaw when in 1995 he prepared his initial business plans57.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 421.\n\nSee para. 253 *infra.*\n\nFirst Decision, para. 270 and para. 201 *infra',* the Tribunal will however not assign any specific value to the AM channel, due to its speculative nature.\n\n84.\n\nAgainst this background, Dr. Voss\u2019 first formulation - that the Tribunal is violating the *res judicata* effect of the September 18, 2000, ICSID award which formalized the Settlement Agreement - is difficult to follow. The Tribunal will therefore focus on Dr. Voss\u2019 second formulation, namely that the Settlement Agreement (i) constitutes a waiver of pre-existing claims regarding the allocation of frequencies, and (ii) precludes consideration of all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings.\n\nThe scope of the Settlement Agreement\n-------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to finally settle all claims which Claimant had filed in an ICSID Additional facility Arbitration against Ukraine58. Claimant agreed to waive these claims, and as a *quid pro quo* Ukraine agreed to appoint a commission of experts for the examination of the quality of Gala\u2019s broadcasting (taking corrective action if necessary), and to use its best efforts to consider in a positive way certain applications for radio frequencies submitted by Gala59.\n\nClause 10.\n\nClause 13 (a) and (b).\n\n86.\n\nThe scope of the claims being settled was defined in Clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement, which states as follows:\n\n*\"The Parties agree and confirm that all the claims, counterclaims, complaints and requests contained in the Consent to Arbitrate, Notice for Arbitration, Ancillary Claims and all other official letters of the Claimant to the Respondent or ICSID, as well as other correspondence of the Claimant addressed to third parties are hereby finally settled\".*\n\n87.\n\nClause 10 of the Settlement Agreement thus provides that all claims, complaints and requests were being settled, subject to one condition: claims must have been referred to in the submissions made during the arbitration or in pre-existing letters and correspondence. This implies that the settlement cannot refer to claims which did not exist as of the date of execution of the Settlement Agreement, or which, existing at that time, had never been mentioned in pre-existing documents, letters or correspondence.\n\n88.\n\nCan any of the claims awarded in the First Decision coincide with the claims affected by the Settlement? The claims accepted by the First Decision consist in the declaration that three tenders and the administrative practice during the Interregnum amounted to violations of the FET standard. Respondent has never alleged that any of these claims was mentioned in documents, letters or correspondence predating March 20, 2000. In fact, it is impossible that these claims could by that date have been mentioned in any type of documents, letters or correspondence, because they materialized after that date. Thus it is factually impossible that Claimant\u2019s claims awarded in this arbitration could be affected by clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n89.\n\nDr. Voss submits a second line of argument: in his opinion, the Tribunal falls foul of clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement, because when it analysed the available evidence regarding Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial business plans, it took into consideration not only the Witness Statements of the relevant witnesses, but also an 1995 exchange of letters between Mr. Lemire and the Ukrainian authorities.\n\n90.\n\nDr. Voss is mistaking claims with facts. Settlement agreements can extinguish all existing claims between the parties in relation to the matters which are being settled. This is what clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement purports to achieve (subject to the additional requirement that claims must have been mentioned in existing written documents). But what settlement agreements in general, and clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement in particular, simply cannot accomplish is to extinguish past factual occurrences. It is a fact - proven in the First Decision - that in 1995 Mr. Lemire developed certain expansion plans for Gala. And when the Tribunal in this Award establishes the compensation owed to Claimant, and for this purpose has to determine Gala\u2019s \"but for\" value, the Tribunal can and must take into account, as a fact, Mr. Lemire\u2019s historic plans. Without doing so, the Tribunal would be unable to develop, with a minimum of certainty, the \"but for\" value of Gala.\n\n91.\n\nThe above conclusions are reinforced by clause 27 of the Settlement Agreement, which provides that the Agreement *\"supersedes all prior correspondence, negotiations and understandings between the parties with respect to the matters covered herein\".* The purpose of this standard clause is that the final Settlement Agreement replace all prior understandings between the parties *\"with respect to the matters covered herein\", i.e.* with regard to the claims being settled and the obligations being assumed. It does not preclude the possibility that this Tribunal, in order to calculate the compensation in a subsequent arbitration, in which different claims are being discussed, takes into account facts which occurred prior to the execution of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n**4. Claimant\u2019s Record in Tender Decisions**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**4.1. Introduction**\n---------------------\n\n92.\n\nDr. Voss starts his analysis of Claimant\u2019s record in tender decisions, with the statement that this record is not directly relevant to the Award. He adds: *\"[t]he latter is based*  ***solely60]***  *on the Interregnum from March 1999 through June 2000 and, in particular, the assumption that Gala would have operated an FM network with nationwide coverage as of January 2001 had it not been denied the requisite frequencies by the* \u2018irregular practice\u2019 *during the Interregnum\"61.*\n\nEmphasis in the original.\n\nSeparate Opinion para. 164; the same idea is repeated in para. 229.\n\n93.\n\nThis statement does not reflect the truth. The Tribunal\u2019s findings (summarized in paragraphs 420 and 421 of the First Decision62) are that three irregular tenders and the irregular practice during the Interregnum amounted to a violation of the FET standard provided for in the BIT. The determination that, in addition to the Interregnum practice, three tenders - including the tender of October 19, 2005, in which the personal and direct interference of the President of Ukraine could be conclusively proven - were tainted by irregularities and gave rise to international wrongs, are fundamental factors for establishing Respondent\u2019s liability.\n\nCopied in para. 31 *supra.*\n\n94.\n\nA completely separate issue is that, for the purpose of calculating Claimant\u2019s damages, the Tribunal will use a comparison between Gala\u2019s \"as is\" value, and its \"but for\" value *(i.e.* its value if Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial plan had not been thwarted by Ukraine\u2019s irregular behaviour). For that purpose, the Tribunal will assume63 that Gala had received during the Interregnum the licences necessary to create a national network. But this assumption does not imply that the irregularities committed by Ukraine in the three relevant tenders can be conveniently forgotten or minimized.\n\nSee para. 261\n\n**4.2. Alternative Explanation for Gala\u2019s Dismal Success Record**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Separate Opinion submits that Respondent has offered a reasonable, even plausible explanation for Gala\u2019s dismal success record in its applications for additional frequencies: the perception on the part of the National Council members that the Ukrainian market was already saturated with Gala\u2019s type of music, and that Gala lacked sufficient resources64.\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 169, 173 and 176.\n\n96.\n\nThe problem with Dr. Voss\u2019 assumption is that the National Council never published the reasons for its decision to award or deny licences - and this represents, as the First Decision found, a *\"significant weakness in the* *administrative procedure\"65.* Consequently, there is no contemporary evidence in the file, in which the National Council explains the reasons for its repeated rejections of Claimant\u2019s applications. Dr. Voss bases his assumptions on a Witness Statement of a member of the National Council, presented in the second phase of this arbitration, *i.e.* after the issuance of the First Decision, and upon this evidentiary basis he sees fit to criticise the First Decision66.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 309.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 177, which refers to the third WS of Ihor Kurus, which was submitted in the second phase of this arbitration and which was not available to the Tribunal when it issued its First Decision.\n\n97.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the evidence presented in this arbitration proves the contrary to what is asserted in the Separate Opinion:\n\n- it is undisputed that in the years 1997 - 1999 Gala Radio held the number 1 and number 2 positions among the broadcasting stations in Kyiv67, that it was capable of attracting talent (including DJ Pascha, the alias of Mr. Pavel Shylko, who acted as the presenter in the Eurovision Festival held in Ukraine, and the Olympic gold medallist Mr. Viktor Petrenko68), that it won prizes for the quality of its broadcasting69 and that its news services were ranked in second place, immediately after those of Radio Era70; on the basis of the evidence produced, the Tribunal is convinced that if Gala Radio had been awarded the appropriate licences, it had the necessary talent and know how to provide a successful radio service in different segments of the market;\n\n- Gala Radio has been financed by capital and loan injections made by its only shareholder, Mr. Lemire; broadcasting is not a capital intensive business; there is no reason to doubt that if the National Council had granted additional licences, Mr. Lemire would have been able to contribute the necessary funds for financing the additional investment (which Goldmedia, the expert designated by Claimant, has established would amount to 2,757,430 UAH, approximately 500,000 USD71).\n\nDoe. CM-131; HTRI, p. 65.\n\nBoth appeared as witnesses in the first hearing of the arbitration.\n\nDoe. CM-89 with a list of Gala Radio\u2019s awards and prizes.\n\nAccording to the ratings produced by Sirex.\n\nGSR, p. 52.\n\n98.\n\nBesides these general comments on the reasons underlying the National Council\u2019s decisions, the Separate Opinion includes a lengthy analysis of the administrative practice during the Interregnum. The Tribunal will only make a few remarks with regard to certain new issues, which the Separate Opinion has brought up for the first time.\n\n**4.3. Administrative Practice during the Interregnum**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn the First Decision the Tribunal concluded that during the Interregnum (between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000), when the National Council was not operative, Respondent developed the practice of issuing licences for radio broadcasting directly, without publicity and without complying with the requirements or applying the procedures established in the law. The *de facto* situation was then legalised through a tender held on January 1, 2001, in which Claimant was not authorised to participate, and which gave preferential treatment to the companies that had been illegally awarded licences during the Interregnum72.\n\nFirst Decision, paras. 409 and 418.\n\n100.\n\nThe Separate Opinion makes a number of comments with regard to these conclusions.\n\n**A.** ***Ultra Petita*** **and** ***Audiatur et Altera Pars***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nIn first instance, the Separate Opinion affirms that Claimant only alleged the illegality of the Interregnum practice as a violation of the Settlement Agreement, but not as a violation of the BIT, and, based on this assertion, concludes that the First Decision violated the principle of *ne ultra petita73.*\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 188 to 190.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n103.\n\nIn his first Memorial, Claimant described Respondent\u2019s practice of granting licences in the time period which expands between the execution of the Settlement Agreement, on March 20, 2000, and the date when the last frequency provided for in Settlement Agreement was actually given to Gala (in October 2002). For this time period, which overlaps with the Interregnum, Claimant presented two specific claims:\n\n- first, that Respondent\u2019s practice of systematic rejection of Gala\u2019s application constituted a violation of the Settlement Agreement74; this claim was dismissed by the Tribunal in its First Decision;\n\n- secondly, Claimant submitted that *\"Respondent instead awarded the frequencies to other applications who were clearly less qualified than Gala. In doing so, Respondent breached the BIT, in particular the requirement that Gala be protected against unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment\"75;* the same allegation was repeated in para. 67.3 of Claimant\u2019s PHB76 (submitted before the First Decision); there can thus be no doubt that, since his initial pleading, Claimant has continuously alleged that Respondent\u2019s denial of licences during the Interregnum period represented a violation of the BIT, and Respondent had ample opportunity to counter these allegations.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 85.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 86. Dr. Voss, in para. 520 of his Separate Opinion, argues that this pleading relates to the period March 2000 to October 2002. The Tribunal disagrees; para. 85 of Claimant\u2019s Memorial defines the applicable time period as *\"up until and well after the May 15, 2000 deadline\"',* such time period covers the Interregnum, which lasted from March 1999 through June 2000.\n\n*\"Respondent\u2019s practice of illegally awarding frequencies to companies other than Gala from the period immediately after the Settlement Agreement until well into 2001,as described in paragraph 57.2 above, constitutes a breach of the BIT provisions offair and equitable treatment (Article 11.3. (c))..\".*\n\n104.\n\nDr. Voss\u2019 assertion that *\"Respondent had thus no opportunity to react\"77* to the Tribunal\u2019s decision is groundless. Respondent did react, both before and after the First Decision78.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 191.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s PHB (submitted before the First Decision), para. 388 analysing Mr. Aksenenko\u2019s letter (Doe. CM 11), which is an important piece of evidence regarding the Interregnum period (see para. 415 First Decision); see also RMRI, paras. 154 *et seq.*\n\n**B. Alleged Falsehood of the Tribunal\u2019s Key Assumption**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nIn the First Decision the Tribunal dismissed Respondent\u2019s defence that the new licences issued during the Interregnum only affected frequencies which came up for renewal. Dr. Voss now submits that the Tribunal erred, because *\"Respondent has thus produced documentary evidence that the majority\u2019s key assumption was false\"79.*\n\nSeparate Opinion para. 199.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n107.\n\nThe First Decision rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that the Interregnum practice only extended to renewals, and it did so on three grounds80:\n\n*\"414. First of all, the renewal of licences under the LTR does not require a tender (Article 24.9). Extension is a \"right\" of the licence holder, and the National Council can reject the application for extension only in very limited circumstances (Article 33.7). Respondent\u2019s explanation of what happened seems a legal impossibility, and is at any rate entirely implausible.*\n\n*415. Secondly, there is a letter sent on September 28, 1999 by S. Aksenenko, a member of the National Council, to the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine 163, in which Mr. Aksenenko protests that other institutions of the executive branch are usurping the National Council\u2019s powers, taking advantage of the fact that it is not operative.*\n\n*416. Finally, Mr. Lemire has presented the transcript of a meeting held on March 19, 2001 with Mr. Koholod, the then chairman of the National Council, who acknowledged that during the interregnum \"some bad things [were] happening\" and that the State Committee, and not the National Council, had been issuing the licences\".*\n\nFirst Decision paras. 414 to 416; footnotes omitted.\n\n108.\n\nAfter the First Decision had been issued, Respondent submitted in its RMRI81 that Articles 24.9 and 33.7 of the Ukrainian Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting, last amended in 2006, [\"LTR\"], to which the Tribunal had referred82, in fact were not in force in year 2000, and that, at that time, the applicable provision was a previous version of Article 17 of the LTR. Respondent attached the text of this Article to his RMRI as Document RLA 10883. Respondent also produced with its RMRI a third WS from Mr. Kurus, in which Mr. Kurus states that in the year 2000 renewals of licences had to be made through tenders, and that of the frequencies irregularly awarded during the Interregnum, 25 corresponded to previously expired licences84.\n\nPara. 174.\n\nAnd which the Tribunal had taken from a translation of the LTR submitted by Claimant as CL A 3, which bears the title *\"The Law of Ukraine in Television and Radio Broadcasting of December 21, 1993\"**.*\n\nIn the relevant passage, art. 17 states: *\"To continue broadcasting the TV and radio company must repeatedly receive the license according to the procedure stipulated by this Law\"*\n\nParas. 7 and 10. In the hearing, the number used by Respondent was 31 (see HTRI, pp. 48 and 49).\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal is prepared to accept, *ad arguendum,* that Respondent\u2019s submission and Mr. Kurus\u2019 WS are correct, and that 25 of the licences granted during the Interregnum corresponded to renewals upon expiration; but even if this hypothesis is accepted, taking into account that more than 80 frequencies were awarded, the Tribunal would see no reason to modify its conclusions regarding the irregularity of the administrative practice during the Interregnum85.\n\nSee also paras. 187 to 188 *infra.*\n\n110.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence - including the statements from Messrs. Aksenenko and Koholod referred to above - that during this period, while the National Council was not operative, the executive branch of Government acted wrongfully: it awarded significant numbers of radio licences directly, without transparency or publicity and without meeting the requirements of or following the procedures established in the LTR - a practice which in the opinion of the Tribunal and due to its blatant disregard of the law implies a violation of the FET standard established in Article II.3 of the BIT.\n\n**C. Licences Granted Under the Settlement Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nDr. Voss finally presents a third argument, which is new and has never been advanced by Respondent: in his opinion,\n\n*\"Gala\u2019s position in relation to the Interregnum practice is similar to the position of other broadcasters in Ukraine in relation to Gala\u2019s treatment under the Settlement Agreement\"86.*\n\nSince there is no doubt about the legality of the Settlement Agreement, the rationale for legality would apply *mutatis mutandis* to Ukraine\u2019s Interregnum practice87.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 207\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 211.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. The facts do not support Dr. Voss\u2019 allegations.\n\n113.\n\nOn 29 December 1997 Mr. Lemire presented the notice to institute his first ICSID arbitration against Ukraine. At that time, Mr. Lemire alleged *(inter alia)* that he had suffered unfair, inequitable and discriminatory behaviour on the part of Ukraine in the awarding of frequencies. The procedure commenced, and two years later the parties eventually reached a Settlement Agreement, in which Claimant agreed to withdraw his claims and Respondent assumed certain obligations in order to redress Mr. Lemire\u2019s situation. The Settlement Agreement regulated the issuance of broadcasting licences in favour of Gala in subparagraphs II and III of Clause 13(b). In accordance with these provisions Ukraine undertook to *\"assist* [Claimant] *for the positive consideration of this issue* [the awarding of licences] *by the National Council\".* This obligation was not absolute, but subject to important caveats, the most important of which was that the licences were to be issued *\"in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation\".* The National Council eventually recognised Gala\u2019s priority position and granted to Gala all 11 broadcasting licences mentioned in Clause 13(b) - albeit with significant delays.\n\n114.\n\nDr. Voss now submits that if one accepts this treatment of Gala by the National Council for the purposes of giving effect to the Settlement Agreement, one must condone Ukraine\u2019s practice during the Interregnum of *de facto* awarding frequencies and authorisations to broadcast without transparency or publicity and in disregard of Ukrainian legislation.\n\n115.\n\nDr. Voss here, too, confuses victim and offender.\n\n116.\n\nMr. Lemire had been denied frequencies. He had been forced to file an ICSID arbitration. His claims must have carried some weight: Respondent preferred to settle, and accepted to redress the injustice by agreeing to assist Gala in its future applications for 11 frequencies - without granting Gala any privileges *\"which are different or additional to the ordinary rights and obligations of a foreign investor in Ukraine in accordance with the Ukrainian laws and international treaties to which Ukraine is a party\".* It seems a travesty to state - as Dr. Voss does - that this act of rebalancing of an unjust situation *\"can in terms of propriety not be distinguished\"88* from Ukraine\u2019s practice during the Interregnum of arbitrarily granting frequencies and authorisations with total disregard of the Law.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 208.\n\n**IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n----------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal reserved two questions to be addressed in this Final Award: the first is *\"the question of appropriate redress of the breach, including the quantification of damages\",* resulting from the First Allegation, *i.e.* the violation of the FET standard defined in the BIT; the second is whether the circumstances of the case, and the harassment which Claimant has allegedly suffered, merit the awarding of moral damages.\n\n118.\n\nEach of the two questions identified in the preceding paragraph will be analysed in separate sections (IV. 1 and IV.2) and additional sections will cover (IV.3) interest and (IV.4) costs.\n\n**IV.1 Quantification of Damages from the Breach of  FET  Standard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Case**\n----------------------\n\n119.\n\nOn April 16, 2010 Claimant submitted his Memorial on Remaining Issues. His arguments and allegations were further developed during the hearing held on July 12, 2010, when his Counsel presented oral Opening and Closing Statements.\n\nMr. Lemire\u2019s Investment in Gala Radio\n-------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nMr. Lemire is the shareholder, through Mirakom, of Gala Radio89. Claimant considers that the loss suffered to the value of his investment corresponds entirely to the prejudice caused to Gala Radio by reason of Ukraine\u2019s breaches of the BIT. He submits that he invested significant amounts of his own money in furthering the business of Gala Radio. These investments include90:\n\n- the letting of 10 apartments with 619 m\u00b2 rent free to the company; this real estate belongs directly or indirectly to Mr. Lemire; the total rental value of these properties for the 1996 - 2010 period is alleged to be 1,310,341 United States Dollar [\"USD\"];\n\n- certain payments made by Claimant, on behalf of Gala Radio, either in fixed assets or in licence fees, amounting to 832,589 USD;\n\n- investments in the development of Gala Radio\u2019s brand, amounting to 2,296,366 USD;\n\n- credit facilities granted to Gala Radio by an offshore company belonging to Mr. Lemire, and not reimbursed, for 277,915 USD;\n\n- the value of the time Mr. Lemire has invested in support of the radio company, at a rate of 360,000 USD per year, amounting to, approximately, 5 millions [\"M\"] USD.\n\nFirst Decision, paras. 36, 53 and 54.\n\nCMRI, para. 11.\n\n121.\n\nClaimant admits that the assets of Mr. Lemire and Gala Radio are commingled91, but submits that even Respondent has accepted between 900,000 USD and 1 MUSD as an investment, and has challenged the rest based on technicalities92. In the radio industry, what matters is expertise and know-how more than resources. As an example, Claimant refers to the purchase by a company called Ukrainian Media Holding [\"UMH\"] of a 50% participation in Radio 5, a full network radio station, for 10 M USD. From this, Claimant infers that a full network has a value of approximately 20 M USD93.\n\nHTRI, p. 14.\n\nHTRI, p. 14\n\nHTRI, p. 14; see also Doe. CM-117 with press report about the transaction.\n\nStructure of Claimant\u2019s Calculation of Damages\n----------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nMr. Lemire\u2019s calculation of damages is based on the comparison of a base scenario [\"Scenario I\"]94, which represents the value of Gala Radio as it operates today, with four alternative hypothetical Scenarios, which represent under different assumptions what its present value would have been, if the violation of the FET standard had not occurred. Claimant submits that the difference between the actual (\"as is\") and the hypothetical (\"but for\") value of Gala Radio represents the damage caused by Respondent to Claimant95.\n\nThe exact meaning of each scenario will be explained in paras. 256 to 259 *infra.*\n\nCMRI, para. 30.\n\n123.\n\nClaimant underlines that the calculation of damages should place Claimant in the position he should have been in, had there not been a breach by Respondent. Since the outset, Mr. Lemire wanted to establish two full networks, and thereafter a third network, Energy. He applied and was defeated each time, and was prevented from creating the three networks because the tenders and procedures for awarding the frequencies breached the FET standard enshrined in the BIT96. During the Interregnum or \"blackout period\"97, during which the National Council was not functioning, Respondent awarded directly more than 80 frequencies98; Claimant submits that with 14 of these frequencies Gala Radio could have covered the whole country; and with seven, two thirds of it99. Thus Gala Radio could have become a national broadcaster. A second FM network could have been obtained by Gala Radio if Ukraine had not acted in breach of the BIT when awarding 12 frequencies to Kokhannya in 2006 and one frequency to Kiss in 2008100. And the AM network could have been awarded in 2004, and been converted to FM in 2006, in the wake of the Radio Era tender101.\n\nHTRI, p. 13.\n\nHTRI, p. 19.\n\nHTRI, p. 18.\n\nHTRI, pp. 23 and 24.\n\nHTRI, p. 24.\n\nHTRI, p. 25.\n\n124.\n\nClaimant has calculated the present value of the various Scenarios using the Discounted Cash Flow [\"DCF\"] methodology developed by its expert, Goldmedia GmbH [\"Goldmedia\"], who issued a report dated April 16, 2010, and testified during the hearing (in the person of Dr. Andr\u00e9 Wiegand). The conclusions of this calculation are the following102:\n\n- Scenario II: the total damage would amount to 30,469,000 USD;  \n- Scenario III: the total damage would amount to 40,402,000 USD;  \n- Scenario IV: the total damage would amount to 46,651,000 USD;  \n- Scenario IV A): the total damage would amount to 43,617,000 USD.\n\nCMRI, para. 53 *et seq.*\n\nCausation\n---------\n\n125.\n\nClaimant submits that causation has already been decided by the Tribunal in its First Decision, and that the Tribunal should not second-guess the outcome of the tenders or engage in an additional review of the procedures in order to establish whether Gala Radio would have won the frequencies103.\n\nHTRI, p. 28.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Case**\n------------------------\n\n126.\n\nOn June 21, 2010 Respondent submitted its RMRI, and then presented arguments and allegations during its Opening and Closing Statements at the Hearing.\n\nThe Financial Crisis and its Impact on Gala Radio\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nRespondent submits that the financial crisis hit the Ukrainian economy in the second half of 2008. A sharp decline ensued in industrial production, in new construction and in the GDP104. The 2008 State budget had to be saved by an emergency loan of 16 billion USD from the International Monetary Fund105. The media market in Ukraine could not avoid the effects of the crisis. Advertising revenues in the radio market declined by 26.4 % in 2009.\n\nGross domestic product.\n\nRMRI, para. 69.\n\n128.\n\nGala Radio\u2019s financial results for 2008 and 2009 also suffered. Profit of 121,000 USD in 2007 became a loss of 264,000 USD in 2008 and a further loss of 81,000 USD in 2009. Revenues also decreased by about 50% from 2008 to 2009 and the EBITDA106 turned negative107.\n\n\"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation\".\n\nRMRI, para. 78.\n\n129.\n\nRespondent further argues that Gala Radio\u2019s statutory financial report does not accurately reflect Gala Radio\u2019s performance. Its revenues and costs are understated. Most employees are paid unrealistically low wages. Respondent suspects that cash payments to employees are made with the purpose of avoiding corporate and payroll taxes108.\n\nHTRI, p. 68.\n\n130.\n\nGala Radio is declining, because its format is no longer popular. In 2010 it did not appear in the rating of the top 10 radio stations, whether in Kyiv or, generally in Ukraine109. This contrasts with the years 1997 - 1999, when its popularity increased to the number 1 position in Kyiv110. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, Gala Radio is a reasonably popular radio station, which has achieved average results, notably in Kyiv and, generally, in Ukraine. But it is not a leader, because it lacks a distinctive music format.\n\nRMRI, para. 83, based on Doe. R 459: DAR Kyiv rating from February 15 to April 25, 2010, which show Gala Radio in place 14.\n\nDoe. CM-131 and HTRI, p. 65.\n\n131.\n\nIn sum, Respondent views Gala Radio as a business which has incurred losses for two years in a row, and has never generated more than 121,000 USD profits per year (Gala Radio\u2019s profit\u2019s having been 105,000 USD, 94,000 USD and 121,000 USD in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively111). Respondent furthermore suspects that Gala Radio\u2019s financial records understate income and expenses.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Statement (presentation for the Hearing on Remaining Issues), p. 24.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Investment in Gala Radio\n-----------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nRespondent argues that the damages claimed are disproportionate to the capital invested, which over a 15-year period in fact amounted to less than 1 M USD112. Respondent then analyses in detail the various categories of investment claimed by Mr. Lemire:\n\n*- Real estate'.* Respondent submits that Claimant has not shown that the apartments were actually used by Gala Radio, and not by Mr. Lemire personally; there are only three lease agreements between Gala Radio and the owners of the apartments, and the rent-free leases do not appear in the company\u2019s financial statements113;\n\n*- Fixed assets',* with regard to this category of assets, Respondent argues that Claimant has not specified whether the outlay was made by Claimant personally or by Gala Radio; in the first case, such payments would not represent an outlay or investment of Claimant himself; after reviewing the record of evidence, Respondent concludes that out of the 832,589 USD claimed by Mr. Lemire under this heading, only 352,439 USD correspond to real investments114;\n\n*- Brand support and marketing'.* In Respondent\u2019s opinion, marketing costs are not classified as investments, but rather as expenses accounted for in the P & L account; there is no evidence that they were paid with Gala Radio\u2019s own funds, rather than contributed by Mr. Lemire115;\n\n*- Credit facilities'.* Claimant has only provided supporting documentation for a single line of credit granted by a BVI116 company (\"Gala Entertainment Ltd.\") to Gala Radio in 2008 in the modest amount of 470,000 USD117;\n\n*- Mr. Lemire \u2019s time'.* Respondent submits that Mr. Lemire\u2019s own time should not be included in the quantification of Claimant\u2019s investments; Mr. Lemire received compensation from Gala Radio - 36,000 USD per annum - and absent evidence to the contrary this sum must represent a fair payment for his time118.\n\nRMRI, para. 100.\n\nRMRI, para. 105.\n\nRMRI, para. 110.\n\nRMRI, para. 114.\n\nBritish Virgin Islands.\n\nRMRI, para. 115.\n\nRMRI, para. 119.\n\nCausation\n---------\n\n133.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has decided to ignore the issue of causation altogether, simply hiding behind rhetoric. In any BIT arbitration, damages may only be awarded to the extent that there is sufficient causal link between the breach and the loss sustained by the investor. Claimant is not entitled to assume causation, but must prove it119.\n\nRMRI, paras. 131 to 135.\n\n134.\n\nSince Claimant did not even attempt to establish a causal link between breaches and alleged loss, the Tribunal should infer that:\n\n- Gala Radio would not have won frequencies in any of the tenders that were identified by the Tribunal in paragraph 421 of the First Decision;\n\n- the breaches were not a proximate cause, let alone dominant cause of Claimant\u2019s loss, because there was an intervening cause for the damage alleged120; and\n\n- it is inherently speculative to find a causal link in any tender process which involves multiple qualified contestants and the application of both objective and subjective criteria.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal should declare that the causal link is not established and Claimant is not entitled to compensation121.\n\nHTRI, p. 42.\n\nRMRI, para. 153.\n\n135.\n\nRespondent further submits that Gala Radio would not have won the FM frequencies allocated in 1999 - 2000122, nor in the tender of January 1, 2001123. As regards the AM frequency, Gala Radio would also have been unsuccessful, because the documents in the record confirm that Gala Radio\u2019s proposed programming concept for the AM frequency was the same as the general FM frequency124. In any case, Gala Radio had no long-term interest in maintaining an AM network in Ukraine, as proven by Claimant\u2019s allegation that a year after obtaining a hypothetical AM frequency, he would have switched the AM talk radio into an FM frequency125. Respondent also analyses the tender of Radio Era and comes to the conclusion that an informational channel of 15 frequencies would never have been allocated to a company with hits music entertainment experience like Gala Radio126. Ukraine further submits that Gala Radio and Energy Media could not have won the Radio Kokhannya tenders of January 25, 2006 and March 30, 2006, because they never participated127. Finally, Respondent alleges that even if Kiss FM had not participated in the tender of February 6, 2008, Gala Radio and Energy would not have won the frequencies, because their applications were not sufficiently convincing and other competitors were better positioned128.\n\nRMRI, para. 168.\n\nRMRI, para. 184.\n\nRMRI, para. 202.\n\nRMRI, para. 221.\n\nRMRI, para. 244.\n\nRMRI, para. 262.\n\nRMRI, para. 272.\n\n136.\n\nSumming up, Respondent submits that Gala Radio lost the tenders identified at para. 421 of the First Decision because of129:\n\n- a lack of a distinct programming;  \n- an absence of innovation;  \n- vague and confusing presentations before the National Council;  \n- under-capitalisation of its business and lack of financial capabilities;  \n- better qualified competitors.\n\nRMRI, para. 285 *et seq.*\n\n137.\n\nSince the results of the tenders can be fully explained by causes independent of the BIT breaches, Claimant cannot establish the required proximity between the breaches and the loss, and should be awarded no damages130.\n\nHTRI, p. 42.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Assessment is Unreliable and Speculative\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nAs a subsidiary argument, Respondent states that Claimant bears the burden of proving the *quantum* of the compensation. The amount of damages must be certain, unchallengeable and not resulting from speculative calculations131. The methodology of Goldmedia\u2019s report, on which Claimant relies, is fundamentally flawed and has led to inaccurate results:\n\nRMRI, para. 302.\n\n139.\n\n(i) Respondent rejects Claimant\u2019s use of the enterprise value or fair market value under various Scenarios. In Ukraine\u2019s opinion the calculation should be performed under a lost profits analysis132. This correction alone, without changing Goldmedia\u2019s other assumptions, would provoke a sharp decrease in the amount of compensation (by more than 14 M USD in Scenario II)133.\n\nHTRI, p. 78 to 79.\n\nRMRI, para. 348.\n\n140.\n\n(ii) Although Goldmedia acknowledged that the Ukrainian radio advertising market was affected by the economic crisis in 2009, and that the overall decrease in media advertising revenues reached 22%, it did not apply this percentage, but only 9%, on the basis that first movers suffered a smaller reduction. In Respondent\u2019s view, this number is a sheer invention by Claimant\u2019s expert134.\n\nRMRI, para. 350.\n\n141.\n\n(iii) Respondent submits that Goldmedia\u2019s projections are unreliable; the expert had projected for 2008 and 2009 that Gala Radio\u2019s profits would amount to 715,000 USD, when in fact there has been a combined loss of 345,000 USD135. In Ukraine\u2019s opinion, this and other similar discrepancies seriously undermine the credibility of Goldmedia\u2019s assessment of damages.\n\nRMRI, para. 338.\n\n142.\n\n(iv) Furthermore, Goldmedia\u2019s analysis is permeated by errors, which include the use of incorrect discount rates, of incorrect starting dates, of incorrect data and of inflated revenues and understated costs136, the inconsistent use of USD versus Ukrainian Hryvnia [\"UAH\"]137 and excessive reliance upon a supposed \"First Mover Advantage\"138.\n\nRMRI, para. 361.\n\nRMRI, para. 367.\n\nRMRI, para. 373.\n\nEBS\u2019s Restatement of Goldmedia\u2019s Calculations\n---------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nFor illustration purposes, EBS Expertise Services [\"EBS\"] - Respondent\u2019s expert - has performed a calculation of Claimant\u2019s alleged damages on the basis of Goldmedia\u2019s basic damage theory, but with the adjustments discussed above. As a consequence, Claimant\u2019s restated damages would be the following139:\n\n- Scenario II: 190,490 USD;  \n- Scenario III: 178,780 USD;  \n- Scenario IV: 205,660 USD;  \n- Scenario IV A): 145,550 USD.\n\nRMRI, paras. 398 to 399; by reference to EBS Supplementary Report [\"ESR\"].\n\n144.\n\nRespondent finally provides, for illustration purposes only, and without admission that Claimant is entitled to compensation, an alternative damage calculation, based on the assumption that Gala Radio would have been granted seven additional frequencies (two FM frequencies in 2001, one AM frequency in 2004, one FM frequency in 2005 and two FM frequencies in 2008). In this new scenario Respondent calculates that the additional profit which Gala Radio could have expected would have amounted to 22,000 USD in 2010. Reduced to net present value, the total damages to be awarded to Claimant would be in the range of 122,000 USD140.\n\nRMRI, para. 403.\n\n**3. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n---------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn order to decide this issue, the Tribunal will first (3.1) make some general observations regarding the calculation of damages in scenarios where a State has violated the FET standard of a BIT; thereafter, (3.2) it will analyse Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimant\u2019s request should be rejected *ab initio* because of lack of causation; then (3.3) review the expert reports submitted by both parties; finally leading to (3.4) the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the *quantum* of prejudice and to its (3.5) conclusions.\n\n**3.1. General Considerations Regarding the Calculation of Damages**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn its First Decision the Tribunal established that Respondent, when awarding radio frequencies to Claimant, breached the FET standard enshrined in Article II.3 of the BIT, and that the relief must consist in an order to Respondent to pay compensation equal to the damages caused. This leads to the issue under discussion, namely the proper quantification of damages.\n\n147.\n\nArticle II.3 of the BIT does not provide any rule regarding the appropriate redress in cases of violation. This contrasts with Article III.l, which prohibits unlawful expropriations and includes precise rules for the calculation of *\"compensation\"141,* based on the concept of *\"fair market value\".* The failure of Article II.3 of the Treaty to specify the relief which an aggrieved investor can seek does not imply that a violation of the FET standard may be left without redress: a wrong committed by a State against an investor must always give rise to a right for compensation of the economic harm sustained142. The *quaestio vexata* is how this economic harm is to be measured.\n\nArticle II.3 of the BIT: *\"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be calculated in freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate, such as LIBOR plus an appropriate margin, from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable; and be freely transferable\".*\n\nSee Article 31.1 International Law Commission [\"ILC\"] Draft Articles on State Responsibility [\"ILC Articles\"] *([The responsible state is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\");* see also Campbell McLachlan/Laurence Shore/Matthew Weiniger: \"International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles\", 2007, [\"McLachlan/Shore/Weiniger\"], p. 334; and Irmgard Marboe: \"Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law\", 2009, [\"Marboe\"], para. 3,114.\n\n148.\n\nThe BIT establishes the rule that compensation for expropriation is to be based on *\"fair market value\"* of the investment; this principle, however, is of little use in the present arbitration, because the breach does not amount to the total loss or deprivation of an asset. Gala Radio still exists and Claimant still owns it: compensation thus cannot be based on fair market value of assets expropriated143.\n\n*LG & E Energy Corp., LG & E Capital Corp, and LG&E International, Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/01), Award of July 25, 2007, *[LG&E],* para. 36.\n\n149.\n\nIt is generally admitted that in situations where the breach of the FET standard does not lead to total loss of the investment, the purpose of the compensation must be to place the investor in the same pecuniary position in which it would have been if respondent had not violated the BIT144. In the classic formulation of the Permanent Court of International Justice [\"PCIJ\"] in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f2w**145**,* reparation:\n\n*\"... must, so far as possible wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear...\"146.*\n\nMarboe, para. 3,288.\n\n*Case Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland),* merits, 1928, PCIJ, Series A, No. 17, p. 21 *et seq**. [\"Factory at Chorz\u00f2w\"].*\n\n*Factory at Chorzow,* p. 47.\n\n150.\n\nReparation can thus take the form of restitution or compensation. In our case, the relief requested by Claimant is limited to compensation, and it is this form of reparation which the Tribunal must address.\n\nCompensation\n------------\n\n151.\n\nThe aim of compensation is the elimination of all negative consequences of the wrongful act, through the payment to the injured party of an amount sufficient to cover *\"any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established\"* (Article 36.2 ILC Articles).\n\n152.\n\nBut this is only a theoretical definition of a general standard; the actual calculation of damages cannot be made in the abstract, it must be case specific: it requires the definition of a financial methodology for the determination of a sum of money which, delivered to the investor, produces the equivalent economic value which, in all probability, the investor would enjoy, \"but for\" the State\u2019s breach. The parties have submitted extensive expert evidence with the purpose of defining and applying this financial methodology. The Tribunal will analyse it in sections 3.3, and 3.4 below. But before that, it is necessary to address one of the fundamental defence lines articulated by Respondent: the absence of causation.\n\n**3.2. Respondent\u2019s Argument of Lack of Causation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n---------------------\n\n153.\n\nRespondent has argued insistently that the Tribunal should *ab initio* reject Claimant\u2019s request for compensation, because there is no causal link between Respondent\u2019s breaches and Claimant\u2019s alleged losses. Respondent submits that Gala Radio would never have won any frequencies in the irregular tenders identified in para. 421 of the First Decision, but would have lost these tenders in any case, because it was a weak applicant and its competitors were better-positioned147.\n\nRMRI, paras. 153 and 285.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Position\n-------------------\n\n154.\n\nIn response, Claimant has argued that it is impossible to second-guess now who would have won certain tenders, and that the issue of causation has already been settled in the First Decision, when the Tribunal decided that Gala Radio had been the subject of unfair and inequitable treatment148.\n\nHTRI, p. 28.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it is a general principle of international law that injured claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that the claimed *quantum* of compensation flows from the host State\u2019s conduct, and that the causal relationship is sufficiently close *(i.e.* not \"too remote\"). The duty to make reparation extends only to those damages which are legally regarded as the consequence of an unlawful act149. Article 36.1 of the ILC Articles reflects this general principle:\n\n*\"The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage* *caused* *thereby\"150.*\n\nBin Cheng: \"General Principles of Law as applied by international Courts and Tribunals\", 1987, [\"Cheng\"], p. 322.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n156.\n\nBut beyond this general principle, the ILC Articles remain silent on the particulars of the issue. It is therefore left to judges and arbitrators to define and give content to the specific elements required151. The only supplementary guidance is provided in Article 39 of the ILC Articles entitled \"Contribution to the injury\", which states:\n\n*\"[I]n the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of* *the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought\".*\n\nBrigitte Stern: \"The Obligation to make reparation\" in \"The Law of International responsibility\" (James Crawford/Alain Pellet/Simon Olleson - Eds.), 2010, p. 570.\n\nRequirements of Causation\n-------------------------\n\n157.\n\nProof of causation requires that (A) cause, (B) effect, and (C) a logical link between the two be established.\n\n**A. Cause**\n------------\n\n158.\n\nThe wrongful acts attributable to Ukraine, in breach of the FET standard, constitute the initial cause. The existence of such acts was established in the First Decision and is *res judicata.* The First Decision made the following ruling152:\n\n*\"To declare that Respondent, in the manner in which it dealt with the award of radio frequencies as described in paragraph 421 of this Decision, breached Article II. 3 of the BIT\u2019153*\n\nAnd paragraph 421 provided as follows:\n\n*\"[...] The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the following decisions did not meet the FET standard provided for in the BIT:*\n\n*- the National Council\u2019s decision adopted on October 19, 2005 granting an FM information channel to Radio Era, and the subsequent decisions to award 12 frequencies to radio Kokannya;*\n\n*- the National Council\u2019s decision of May 26, 2004 denying Gala Radio the licence for an AM channel, and the decision of December 21, 2004 granting such licence to NART TV;*\n\n*- the National Council\u2019s decision of February 6, 2008 denying Gala\u2019s application and accepting the application of Kiss Radio;*\n\n*- Respondent\u2019s practice of awarding radio licences while the National Council\u2019s was not operative between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000, and the National Council\u2019s decision of January 1,* *2001 to legalize the licences illegally granted during the* [Interregnum]\".\n\nFirst Decision, para. 513.\n\nThe First Decision initially referred, by mistake, to para. 422. This typographical error was duly corrected.\n\n159.\n\nIn order to reach this decision, the Tribunal concluded that\n\n*\"there are factors (the strikingly different success rates of Gala and of its competitors, the inexistence of any information regarding the real owners of the competing stations, the impossibility of verifying the reasons why Gala was rejected) which can be construed as indications that at least some of the decisions of the National Council when it awarded frequencies were arbitrary and/or discriminatory\"154*\n\nThe Decision went on to say:\n\n*\"To confirm or reject these indications, the Tribunal then looked in detail at five tenders of radio frequencies and the administrative practice for awarding licences in the* [Interregnum]\"155.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 420.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 421.\n\n160.\n\nThe result of this analysis was that a number of tenders, plus the administrative practice while the National Council was not operative, were found not to meet the minimum standard required by the BIT.\n\n**B. Effect**\n-------------\n\n161.\n\nWithout licences granted by the National Council, it is unlawful to engage in the business of broadcasting. Consequently the effect of the irregular denial of licences was that Gala Radio\u2019s business plans could not be achieved, that its planned development was curtailed, its market position eroded, its capacity to generate profits impaired and its potential market value was never achieved; and Claimant, as owner of Gala Radio, suffered the corresponding losses. The damage due to Mr. Lemire can be established as the difference in value between Gala which he actually owns (Gala\u2019s \"as is\" value), and the Gala which he had planned, and which he has not been able to achieve, due to Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts (Gala\u2019s \"but for\" value). Claimant is requesting *lucrum cessans,* compensation for an asset or profit which he never acquired, but which, absent the wrongdoing, he would have earned.\n\n162.\n\nIf the damage is defined as the difference in value between the Gala Mr. Lemire planned and the real Gala which Claimant now owns, the question of Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial business plans becomes decisive. This question has already been clarified in the First Decision156: Mr. Lemire\u2019s initial plans when he bought into Gala Radio in June 1995 were to create an FM national broadcaster, for music format, plus a second AM channel, for talk radio - this is the \"but for\" scenario. But the \"as is\" reality is quite different from the plan: Claimant is the owner of what basically is a local Kyiv radio station, complemented by low power frequencies in 11 Ukrainian cities, which Gala Radio obtained under the Settlement Agreement (plus an additional frequency in a remote village in rural Ukraine). The whole network only covers 22% of Ukraine\u2019s population157.\n\nAnd further analysis has been provided in paras. 71 *et seq.* of this Award.\n\nCMRI, para. 36.\n\n**C. Causal Link**\n------------------\n\n**a) Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe third element of causality is the so called causal link, the chain which leads from cause to effect. The causal link can be viewed from two angles: the positive aspect requires that the aggrieved party prove that an uninterrupted and proximate logical chain leads from the initial cause (in our case the wrongful acts of Ukraine) to the final effect (the loss in value of Gala); while the negative aspect permits the offender to break the chain by showing that the effect was caused - either partially or totally - not by the wrongful acts, but rather by intervening causes, such as factors attributable to the victim, to a third party or for which no one can be made responsible (like *force majeure)158.*\n\nThe Tribunal in the Lauder case *(Ronald S. Lauder* v. *Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL case, Award of September 3, 2001, para. 234) seems to have placed on the aggrieved party the burden of proving that such intervening causes were not the immediate cause for the damage. This Tribunal, however, sees no reason to deviate from the generally accepted principle *alleganti probatio incumbit.* If the offender claims that other intervening causes exist, which are the superseding cause for the damage, it is for such offender to marshal the necessary evidence.\n\n164.\n\nAnother preliminary distinction is important: causal links can be divided into pure or transitive159. Pure causal links exist when the damage derives directly from the wrongful act, without intermediary elements. In practice, this situation is rare, because it is difficult to prove that a certain factor is the immediate and unique cause of a result. Normally, the link between wrong and damage is more complex, and additional elements intervene to form a chain of events.\n\nThe terminology is from Brigitte Bollecker-Stern: \"Le prejudice dans la th\u00e9orie de la responsabilit\u00e9 international\", 1973, [\"Bollecker-Stern\"], p. 186.\n\n165.\n\nThus, if a State wrongfully arrests a vessel, thereafter the shipping company is forced into bankruptcy, and if its shareholders finally suffer a loss, the causal link between wrongful act and loss is transitive: the loss has not been caused directly by the arrest, but rather by the bankruptcy, which in its turn was caused by the wrongful action.\n\n166.\n\nTransitive causal links do not exclude the responsibility of the wrongdoer - even in cases where a *lucrum cessans* is claimed160. But the victim must prove that the chain of events is neither too remote nor too aleatory161. The classic definition of this principle is contained in the *Administrative Decision num. 2* of 1 November 1923\u00a0of the US-German Mixed Commission162:\n\n*\"It matters not whether the loss be directly or indirectly sustained so long as there is a clear, unbroken connection between Germany\u2019s act and the loss complained of. - It matters not how many links there may be in the chain of causation connecting Germany\u2019s act with the loss sustained, provided there is no breach in the chain and the loss can be clearly, unmistakably and definitely traced, link by link, to Germany\u2019s act... All indirect losses are covered provided only that in legal contemplation Germany\u2019s act was the efficient and proximate cause and source from which they flowed\".*\n\nCheng, p. 247.\n\nBollecker-Stern, p. 211-214.\n\nDoc. RLA38, p. 29.\n\n167.\n\nIn the shipping example given above, the victim, in order to be entitled to compensation, would have to prove each element of the chain of events: that the arrest of the ship led to losses for the shipping company, that the losses led to its bankruptcy and that, as a consequence of the bankruptcy, the shareholders lost their investment. And *vice versa:*\u00a0the State could escape responsibility if it could prove that some other cause *(e.g.* mismanagement) provoked the bankruptcy and the shareholders\u2019 loss.\n\n168.\n\nIn the case submitted to the Tribunal, the causal link is not only transitive (because damage is not caused directly by Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts), it also has a second, more specific characteristic: the State\u2019s irregular behaviour took place in public tenders, convened for the awarding of radio frequencies in accordance with pre-established legal criteria. The presence of tenders within the causal chain creates at least two additional difficulties:\n\n- first of all, a number of **bona fide** third parties - and not only Claimant and the media groups irregularly privileged by the authorities - participated in the tenders; the possibility that these **bona fide** third parties could have been awarded frequencies in preference over Claimant must be factored into the analysis;\n\n- the difficulty is increased by a specific feature of the Ukrainian process: although the law established a number of criteria for awarding frequencies by tender, the National Council was not required to explain the reasons underlying its decisions - each member simply voted in favour of the participant he preferred, and the participant who received five votes was awarded the frequency.\n\nProximity and Foreseeability\n----------------------------\n\n169.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the Ukrainian process for the awarding of licences, it is impossible to establish, with total certainty, how specific tenders would have been awarded if the National Council had not violated the FET standard. The best that the Tribunal can expect Claimant to prove is that through a line of natural sequences it is probable - and not simply possible - that Gala would have been awarded the frequencies under tender163. If it can be proven that in the normal cause of events a certain cause will produce a certain effect, it can be safely assumed that a (rebuttable) presumption of causality between both events exists, and that the first is the proximate cause of the other.\n\nBollecker-Stern, p. 201; see also Decision in *Maninat* by the French-Venezuelan Mixed Commission of July 31, 1905; Recueil des Sentences Arbitrates, Volume X, p. 81.\n\n170.\n\nThe chain of causation can also be seen from the opposite point of view: offenders must be deemed to have foreseen the natural consequences of their wrongful acts, and to stand responsible for the damage caused. Proximity and foreseeability are related concepts: a chain of causality must be deemed proximate, if the wrongdoer could have foreseen that through successive links the irregular acts finally would lead to the damage. As the Portuguese-German Arbitral Tribunal said in the *Angola* case164:\n\n*\"It would not be equitable to let the injured party bear those losses which the author of the initial illegal act has foreseen and perhaps even intended, for the sole reason that, in the chain of causation, there are some intermediate links\".*\n\n31 July 1928, Recueil des Sentences Arbitrates, Volume II, p. 1031.\n\n171.\n\nIn summary, the specific circumstances of this case require that two links in the causal chain be analysed and be proven:\n\n- if the tenders had hypothetically been decided in a fair and equitable manner, and Claimant had participated in them, he (and not some of the other participants) would have won the disputed frequencies;\n\n- with these frequencies, Mr. Lemire would have been able to grow Gala Radio into the broadcasting company he had planned: a FM national broadcaster, for music format, plus a second AM channel, for talk radio.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established the existence of wrongful acts attributable to Ukraine, in breach of the FET standard. What remains to be analysed is whether the first and second links of the chain of causation can be deemed to have been proven and whether they are sufficiently proximate.\n\n**b) The First Link**\n---------------------\n\n173.\n\nCould Gala have obtained the frequencies necessary to create a national FM broadcaster and an AM channel for talk radio?\n\nNational FM Broadcaster\n-----------------------\n\n174.\n\nGala Radio had two avenues open in order to expand its franchise in Kyiv, and to become a national FM broadcaster: the first possibility was to obtain high powered frequencies in a small number of cities, and the second to receive low powered frequencies in a larger number of cities.\n\n175.\n\n(i) In the beginning, Gala appears to have pursued the first route: during the negotiations with the National Council in 1995, the alternative discussed was that Gala receive frequencies in 12 cities, with a (high) power of between 5 and 10 kW165. The frequencies were never awarded and Claimant filed the first ICSID arbitration. This led to the Settlement Agreement, dated March 20, 2000, in which Respondent agreed to *\"use its best possible efforts to consider in a positive way the application\"* in 11 of the 12 cities originally discussed. The Settlement Agreement did not require that the new frequencies to be awarded attain a specific power, and those eventually allocated only had an average of 1.17 kW166. Because of the low power, Gala was only able to reach some 22% of the population of Ukraine167. Claimant\u2019s first route to obtaining a national FM broadcaster was thus thwarted.\n\nThe evidence is clear: the National Council\u2019s July 18, 1995 Letter, Doe. CM-1, addressed to the State Committee; the reaction of the State Committee was encouraging: it offered FM frequencies in 11 cities with an average power of 22 kW; see letter from the State Committee of October 18, 1995 (Doe. CM-2).\n\nFirst Decision, para. 194; the First Decision came to the conclusion that the allocation of low powered frequencies did not constitute a breach of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 194.\n\n176.\n\n(ii) The second route for achieving this objective would have required the allocation of low powered frequencies in a larger number of cities. Claimant has averred - and Respondent has not disputed - that with additional licences in 14 locations, Gala would have been able to cover the whole country168. And Claimant has alleged that these frequencies could and should have been awarded to Gala during the Interregnum, when the National Council was not operative, or in the tender organized on January 1, 2001 to legalize the situation169.\n\nHTRI, p. 23 and 24.\n\nCMRI, para. 37.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs.\n\n178.\n\nDuring the period between March 16, 1999 and June 9, 2000, when the National Council was not operative, more than 80 licences170 for radio broadcasting were issued directly by the executive branch of the Government, without transparency or publicity and without meeting the requirements of or following the procedures established in the LTR. The *de facto* situation was then legalised through a subsequent tender, convened by the National Council exclusively for this purpose. Claimant was excluded from this procedure171.\n\nThe number is not contentious: see Doe. R 209.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 417.\n\n179.\n\nIf these 80 plus frequencies had been awarded by tender in accordance with the procedure set forth in the LTR, it is likely that Claimant would have won the 14 licences required to create a national FM network. The Tribunal bases its opinion on the undisputed fact that at the time of the Interregnum, Gala Radio was one of the most successful radio operators in Kyiv - it held the number 1 and 2 position172. If the National Council had proceeded properly to award the new licences, it would have applied the criteria set forth in Article 25.14 of the LTR173. Gala Radio was well placed to meet these criteria: being one of the leading operators, it would have received high marks with regard to the first and third criteria; and as regards the second criterion, Gala was well known to have broadcast socially relevant programs174; moreover, as an independent broadcaster, its presence would reinforce freedom of speech.\n\nDoe. CM-131 and HTRI, p. 65. In para. 314 of his Separate Opinion, Dr. Voss accepts that in 1999 Gala held a predominant market position, adding that this position eroded quickly and consistently down to rank 15 in 2008. In his opinion, these facts discredit the Award\u2019s reliance on Gala\u2019s overall competitive strength. The Tribunal disagrees. It sees Gala\u2019s decadence as additional evidence that Respondent\u2019s irregular behaviour, denying frequencies, provoked that what originally was a successful radio operator became relegated to an ancillary position in the Ukrainian broadcasting market.\n\n*\"While considering the applications the National Council shall prefer TV/radio organization that: a) is capable to fulfil the licence conditions to the best extent; b) prefers socially important programs (informational, social and political, children, etc.), satisfies informational needs of national minorities and secures freedom of speech; c) has an advantage in financial and economical as well as professional and technical capabilities for TV/radio broadcasting'.*\n\nIt sponsored events as the Olympics, Chestnut Run, Burs\u2019 Night Charity Ball, We are the Champions, Golden Lilya and many others. See WS of Mr. Denisenko, p. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counterarguments\n-----------------------------\n\n180.\n\nRespondent has argued175 that in a hypothetical tender, Claimant would not have won these frequencies, and submits a number of arguments:\n\nRMRI, paras. 168 to 180.\n\n181.\n\n(i) In first place, Respondent alleges that Gala never planned to compete for the additional 14 frequencies176.\n\nRMRI, para. 160.\n\n182.\n\nThe argument is without merit, because the key issue is not whether Claimant participated or not in the irregular practices and the rigged tenders, since no one can be held to task for failing to participate in irregular administrative procedures. The question which must be proven is premised upon the hypothesis that the tenders had been announced and then decided in strict compliance with Ukrainian law and without violating the FET standard, and that Gala had been compliant. Under these assumptions, the Tribunal finds that Gala, in all probability, would have been awarded, at the least, the comparatively small number of frequencies required to fulfil its plans.\n\n183.\n\n(ii) In second place, Respondent submits that the Settlement Agreement was signed on March 20, 2000177 and later confirmed in the Award by Consent of September 18, 2000; consequently, in Respondent\u2019s opinion, any allocation of frequencies by the State Committee before September 18, 2000 could not serve as a foundation for damages claims178.\n\nThis date, when the meeting of minds took place, is the relevant date; and not September 18, 2000, when the Settlement Agreement was formalized into an Award.\n\nRMRI, para. 167.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n185.\n\nWhen Claimant signed the Settlement Agreement on March 20, 2000, he accepted to withdraw his claims, against Ukraine\u2019s best efforts obligation to assign a number of frequencies on the terms and conditions established in such Agreement. By executing the Settlement Agreement, Claimant did not, however, acquiesce to Ukraine\u2019s violations of the FET standard. The Settlement does not state so, and none of its clauses can be interpreted to provide for such acceptance. There is no evidence that, when the Settlement Agreement was executed, Claimant was even aware of Respondent\u2019s irregular practice of awarding licences without publicity and without tenders. This violation continued throughout the Interregnum, which lasted till June 9, 2000, and then extended to the tender of 1 January 2001, in which the National Council legalized the licences illegally granted during the Interregnum; whatever may have been agreed in the Settlement Agreement cannot be considered as Claimant\u2019s acquiescence to Ukraine\u2019s wrongful conduct.\n\n186.\n\n(iii) In third place, Respondent argues that the 80 plus licences awarded during the Interregnum in fact would never have been available to Gala Radio, because they either referred to locations where Gala was already broadcasting or were allocated to other broadcasters already using these frequencies with a preferential right179.\n\nRMRI, para. 168; HTRI, p. 20.\n\n187.\n\nThe argument cannot be accepted, because Gala Radio was only transmitting in Kyiv, and the frequencies it then obtained in 11 cities had very low power; as regards the priority rights of previous broadcasters, this only affected 31 frequencies180 and Claimant has convincingly shown that 20 of these could have been awarded181. The Tribunal concludes that during the Interregnum there were enough frequencies available so that Gala Radio, the leading operator in the Kyiv area, should have been able to secure at least 14 radio stations in order to create a nationwide music radio network.\n\nHTRI, p. 20.\n\nHTRI, p. 23.\n\n188.\n\n(iv) As a fourth argument, Respondent submits that Gala suffered a lack of distinct programming, an absence of innovation and that its presentations before the National Council were vague and confusing182.\n\nRMRI, para. 288.\n\n189.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is disinclined to accept that Gala Radio\u2019s alleged shortcomings could have had an effect on the denial of frequencies, especially in 2000 and early 2001, when Gala Radio undoubtedly was one of the leading radio stations in Ukraine and was broadcasting a highly successful concept. Mr. Lemire has made a detailed description in his witness statements183 of the technology used by Gala and how state of the art equipment was for the first time introduced in Ukraine; the Arbitral Tribunal is unpersuaded by Respondent\u2019s allegations of absence of innovation.\n\nWS of Mr. Lemire, para. 21; WS of Mr. Shylko, para. 5.\n\n190.\n\nThe record also contains Gala\u2019s appearance before the National Council, which were far from being considered vague and confusing. Well-known Ukrainian celebrities like DJ Pasha (the best known DJ in Ukraine184) and Mr. Viktor Petrenko (a role model in Ukraine due to his accomplishments as the only male Winter Olympic Gold Medal winner in ice figure skating in Ukraine185) attended tenders to make presentations on behalf of Claimant; which shows that Claimant made efforts to impress the National Council. Statements were also made by Mr. Lemire himself, Mr. Sergey Denisenko and Gala Radio\u2019s lawyer186. Claimant often encountered the problem that the National Council ignored or even prevented Gala Radio from making its presentation187.\n\nHT, Day 2,p. 137.\n\nWS of Mr. Petrenko, para. 13.\n\nHT, Day l,p. 252.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 253; WS of Mr. Petrenko, para. 20.\n\n191.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal concludes that under the hypothesis that Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts (the practice of awarding radio licences while the National Council was not operative and the tender of January 1, 2001 to legalise the licences) had not occurred, and that the more than 80 licences had been correctly assigned in compliance with Ukrainian legislation, Gala Radio should have received, no later than January 1, 2001, at least the 14 frequencies required to operate a nationwide FM music network188.\n\nDr. Voss in his Separate Opinion states that Respondent was misled in building its defence and that his right to be heard was violated (p. xiv of his summary). The argument lacks any merit. Both parties presented well-reasoned and extensive Submissions on Remaining Issues. During the hearing held on July 12, 2010, Claimant and Respondent had the opportunity to orally present Opening Statements and Closing Statements (see pp. 2 to 93 and 248 to 273 of the HTRI). At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal asked the parties whether *\"they* [were] *aware of any breach of due process'\"* (HTRI p. 274); Respondent answered *\"We have no objections to assert* (HTRI, p. 274).\n\nAM Channel for Informational Radio\n----------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nWould Gala Radio also have been awarded an AM channel for informational radio?\n\n193.\n\nThere is no evidence in the file that during the Interregnum AM frequencies were assigned, thus, the Tribunal cannot assume that Gala Radio could have received at that time the licence for an AM channel. The opportunity arose three years later, when in May 2004 the National Council convened a tender for a powerful AM frequency with nationwide coverage. In the First Decision189 the Tribunal declared that the National Council\u2019s decision of May 26, 2004 denying Gala Radio the licence for an AM channel had violated the FET standard defined in the BIT.\n\nPara. 421.\n\n194.\n\nClaimant has submitted that if the May 26, 2004 National Council decision had been properly adopted, Gala Radio should have been the winner of the tender190.\n\nCMRI, para. 42.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs.\n\n196.\n\nThree participants decided to bid in the 2004 tender for a nationwide AM frequency: Odessa Legal Academy [\"Radio Academy\"], Charity Public Fund Radio [\"CPFR\"] and Gala Radio. The applicable legislation at the time of the tender set forth the following criteria for selecting the winner (Article 14 LTR, as amended on January 10, 2002191):\n\n*\"The interests of television viewers and radio listeners; the need to protect national interests, to promote cultural values; the need for more complete coverage of the viewpoints of various social groups in television and radio programs; compliance with the conditions specified in the application for license and with the tender conditions; compliance with technical capacities and creative potential during arrangement of television and radio broadcasting to the stated characteristics, to the obligations of television and radio organizations as regards social broadcasting; previous use of the broadcasting channel\".*\n\nDoc. RLA 13.\n\n197.\n\nRadio Academy was a small radio company, created two years before, which was using an AM frequency in Mikolayiv Oblast, a region of Ukraine, to broadcast to villagers; its plan was to use the new frequency to expand its coverage to other rural areas192. CPFR was a non-commercial radio, which had been broadcasting for two years through the internet. It intended to use the AM frequency for a simpler, more popular program, with a ratio of 60% informational and 40% music entertainment193. Compared with these two competitors, Gala Radio had been transmitting for 10 years, it was Kyiv\u2019s most successful music broadcaster and it had been ranked number two as regards the quality of its news services194.\n\nDoc. R 439, transcript of the session of the National Council, p. 2.\n\nDoc. R 439, transcript of the session of the National Council, p. 3.\n\nSee paras. 97 and 179 *supra.*\n\n198.\n\nConfronted with these three applications, the National Council\u2019s decision was to let the tender fail, not awarding the frequency to any of the participants, and to immediately convene a new tender; and in this new procedure to award the channel to NART TV - an entity with close ties to the President of Ukraine. The Tribunal has already decided that, in doing so, the National Council violated the FET standard enshrined in the BIT.\n\n199.\n\nWhat would have happened under the hypothesis that the National Council had properly decided the tender of May 26, 2004, in accordance with the criteria set forth in Ukrainian law then in force?\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that in such case it is probable that Gala, by far the best qualified of the three competitors, the only one with a broadcasting experience in Kyiv, with a proven and successful track record as a music transmitter and as a news provider, should have been successful. It certainly was the participant which best complied with the criteria established by legislation.\n\n201.\n\nIn summary: the Tribunal finds that, under the assumption that Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts had not occurred, and that tenders had been correctly awarded under applicable Ukrainian legislation, it is probable that Gala would have been able to fulfil its initial plans:\n\n- by 2001 it would be operating a nationwide FM music channel;  \n- by 2004 Gala would additionally have received an AM informational channel.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the first link of the causal chain, the assumption that if the tenders had hypothetically been decided in a fair and equitable manner, and Claimant had participated in them, he (and not some of the other participants) would have won the disputed frequencies, has been satisfied.\n\n**c) The Second Link**\n----------------------\n\n203.\n\nThis leads to the second link of the chain: having received these frequencies, would Mr. Lemire have been able to develop Gala into the successful broadcasting company he had planned, a FM national broadcaster, for music format, plus a second AM channel, for talk radio195?\n\nIn his Separate Opinion (paras. 331 and 335), Dr. Voss disqualifies Gala\u2019s business plans, alleging that they were created *\"ad hoc for the purpose of this arbitration\".* This is contrary to the proven facts. The Tribunal has established (see para. 270 of the First Decision), on the basis of coetaneous documentary evidence and of witnesses\u2019 declarations, that in 1995 Mr. Lemire\u2019s business plans were to convert Gala into a national broadcaster and to create a second AM channel.\n\n204.\n\nRespondent submits196 that under no circumstances would this have happened, arguing that Gala Radio was a weak, undercapitalized company, lacking the financial clout to develop its business197, even if the frequencies had been available. Respondent pleads that Gala\u2019s own shortcomings were the proximate cause of its lack of growth198 and, subsidiarily, that this should at least be considered as a contributing cause199.\n\nRMRI, paras. 8 and 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, para. 618 *et seq.*\n\nRMRI, para. 139.\n\nRMRI, para. 141.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. In its opinion Gala Radio was a reasonably well funded corporation, and it had the financial strength and the necessary know how to successfully operate the two radio channels.\n\n206.\n\nIt is true that Gala Radio is not a large company. It is a private company owned by an individual, Mr. Lemire. But throughout its life time, Gala Radio has been a reasonably successful broadcaster. Its revenues went up from 568,900 USD in 2001 to 1,369,050 USD in 2007. Its real EBITDA continuously grew, reaching almost 6 M UAH in 2005200. It has financed its development with capital contributions and loans from its shareholder. Although there is little information in the record regarding Mr. Lemire\u2019s net worth, there also is no indication that Gala Radio was insufficiently funded or that it had to abandon any business project because of lack of financing. But even if such shortcomings existed *(quod non probatur),* Respondent has not been able to prove that Gala Radio\u2019s competitors did not present the same shortcomings and thus were better qualified in this respect - especially not in a system in which the National Council, when awarding frequencies, apparently did not know the ownership and the actual financial strength of the companies to whom it was assigning the tenders201.\n\nESR, p. 39; this is the expert\u2019s estimation of Gala Radio\u2019s real EBITDA.\n\nWS of Mr. Shevchenko (Rebuttal), para. 74.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal is also convinced that, if the National Council had awarded Gala Radio the authorisations, Gala Radio had the necessary know how to successfully manage the channels. Gala had won a number of awards for the quality of its broadcasting202, it employed four of the top 10 disc jockeys in Ukraine, including the well-known DJ Pascha203, its news services were highly ranked, and it had held the number 1 or number 2 position among the broadcasting stations in Kyiv204. There is no reason to believe that it would not have been able to provide excellent nationwide music and informational programs.\n\nDoe. CM-89 with a list of Gala Radio\u2019s awards and prizes.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 233.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 65.\n\n208.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has been able to prove that the initial cause (Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts) and the final effect (Claimant\u2019s frustration to fulfil his plans and operate a nationwide FM channel plus an AM informational channel) are linked through a chain of causation. And this chain of causation is proximate and foreseeable: Ukraine was aware of Claimant\u2019s business plans, Ukraine could foresee that irregularities in the tender procedures would result in the rejection of Gala Radio\u2019s applications thwarting Gala\u2019s expansion and eventually leading to a reduction in the value of the company and to a loss for its investor. And Respondent has not been able to prove that the denial of frequencies was due to causes other than the National Council\u2019s wrongful behaviour, that if tenders had not been rigged, Gala would not have succeeded in receiving the authorisations required to create a nationwide FM network plus an AM channel and that, once awarded, Gala would not have been able to muster the financial resources and know how to successfully operate both channels.\n\n**d) Analysis of the Case Law Submitted by Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nRespondent has drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to two awards, which in Respondent\u2019s opinion, support its arguments.\n\n210.\n\n(i) The first case is *Biwater**205**:*\n\nIn 2003 **Biwater** was awarded different contracts for the implementation of the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Infrastructure. The most important contract was a lease agreement, under which claimant was to lease certain assets belonging to the State and to use them to supply water and sewerage services. The project turned out to be a failure. Claimant filed an ICSID arbitration, claiming, among other things, expropriation and breach of the FET standard. The arbitral tribunal concluded that as at the date immediately prior to the first act of respondent in breach of the BIT, the performance of the lease contract was already encountering serious problems206, which showed that claimant would suffer significant operating losses going forward207. The proximate or direct cause of the loss and damage for which **Biwater** sought compensation were acts and omissions which had already occurred prior to the BIT breach. None of respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT in fact caused the loss and damage in question, or broke the chain of causation that was already in place208\n\n*Biwater Gaujf (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *United Republic of Tanzania,* Doe. RLA 74, (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Award of July 24, 2008, *[\u2018Biwater\"].*\n\n*Biwater,* paras. 788 and 789.\n\n*Biwater,* para. 790.\n\n*Biwater,* para. 798.\n\n211.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not think that this case, quoted by Respondent, in fact helps to support Respondent\u2019s position. In *Biwater* claimant\u2019s damages were the consequence of the desperate financial condition which claimant had put itself into, prior to the violation of the BIT. In our case, the first violation of the BIT took place during the Interregnum, at a time when Gala Radio was a successful radio operator and a leader in its field. Thus, Claimant\u2019s damages, its loss of business, can in no way be due to the situation in which Claimant found himself immediately prior to the violation of the BIT.\n\n212.\n\n(ii) Respondent has also referred to *ELSI**209**:*\n\nELSI was an Italian company wholly owned and controlled by two American companies. Since September 1967 it was obvious for its shareholders that a financial crisis was imminent and the responsible officers were keeping a close watch on the declining funds, to ensure that *ELSI* did not reach a point where continued operations would be contrary to Italian law. On April 1, 1968 representatives of ELSI met representatives of its banking creditors to discuss the company\u2019s plans for an orderly liquidation. However, no agreement was reached. On the same day the Mayor of Palermo issued an order, effective immediately, requisitioning ELSI\u2019s plant and related assets for a period of six months. A decree of bankruptcy was issued by a Palermo Court on May 16, and a trustee and creditors committee was appointed. Subsequently, ELSI\u2019s premises, plant and equipment were sold in an auction. The Chamber denied the existence of a violation of the Treaty. The Chamber held that ELSI had no practical possibility of successfully carrying out a scheme of orderly liquidation under its own management and consequently it was not the requisition that deprived it of this faculty of control and management. The Chamber went on to say that there was an uncertain and speculative character in the causal connection between the requisition and the results attributed to it by the United States. The Chamber acknowledged that there were several causes acting together that led to the disaster of ELSI and that the requisition might have been one of them, but the underlying cause was ELSI\u2019s headlong course towards insolvency210.\n\nCase concerning *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (United States* v. *Italy),* Doc. RLA 113, International Court of Justice, July 20, 1989 *[\"ELSE].*\n\nPara. 101 of the judgment\n\n213.\n\n*ELSI* hardly presents any similarities with the present case and in no way can it be interpreted in favour of Respondent\u2019s position.\n\n214.\n\nAlthough the judgment refers to a *\"causal connection\"*, what the Chamber is actually doing is analysing whether the facts (basically, the requisition) constitute a violation of the Treaty (and not, whether the violation had caused damages to the aggrieved). The question under discussion is not the issue of causation with regard to damages, and the conclusions reached have no significant bearing for the present Award.\n\n**3.3. Review of the Expert Reports Submitted by the Parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nBoth Claimant and Respondent have retained damage experts.\n\n216.\n\nClaimant has submitted two damage reports, one dated August 20, 2008211 and a supplementary report dated April 16, 2010212. Both were prepared by Goldmedia, a research institute and strategic consultancy founded in 1998 and based in Berlin, specialised in the fields of media and telecommunications213. Dr. Andr\u00e9 Wiegand, Goldmedia\u2019s Co-Managing Director, was the person responsible for the reports, and was examined by the parties and the Tribunal at the hearing held on July 12, 2010214.\n\nGoldmedia First Report [\"GFR\"].\n\nGoldmedia Supplementary Report [\"GSR\"].\n\nGFR, p. 79.\n\nHTRI, p. 103.\n\n217.\n\nRespondent has also presented two damage reports, one dated November 3, 2008 and one dated June 21, 2010215. These reports were prepared by EBS, a consultancy founded in 1998 in Ukraine, specialized in financial consulting services. Ms. Olena216 Volska is the person responsible for the reports. She is EBS\u2019 Managing Partner and Director and was examined by the parties and the Tribunal at the hearing held on July 12, 2010217.\n\nESR.\n\nSometimes referred to as Helena.\n\nHTRI, p.193.\n\n**A. Goldmedia\u2019s Calculations**\n-------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nGoldmedia\u2019s calculation of damages is based on the differences in value between five different Scenarios, of which Scenario I represents an evaluation of Gala Radio as it exists today, from January 1, 2001 up until September 18, 2015. The other four scenarios (which all end in 2015) represent hypothetical situations: they show the value which Gala Radio would have reached, under certain assumptions, if Respondent had not breached the FET standard. The four Scenarios, denominated II through IV A), are the following:\n\n**- Scenario II** represents the present value of Gala Radio if it had been a full national network; it assumes that Gala Radio would have been able to establish itself as a full national network as of January 2001, because it would have participated in tenders held in the 1999 - 2000 period, from which it was excluded while the National Council was inactive;\n\n**- Scenario III** represents the present value of Gala Radio as a full national network from 2001, plus a second FM radio network for young audiences, which would have been granted to Gala Radio by 2006, if Respondent had not breached its BIT obligations;\n\n**- Scenario IV** represents the present value of Gala Radio as a full national network from 2001, plus a second FM radio network for young audiences from 2001, plus a third nationwide AM radio network with talk radio format; in this Scenario, the AM network would have been granted by 2004 and Claimant foresees that the AM network would have switched to FM from 2006 onwards;\n\n**- Scenario IV A)** finally represents the present value of Gala Radio as a full national network from 2001, plus a second nationwide AM radio network with talk radio format.\n\n219.\n\nUsing a DCF methodology Goldmedia projected and compared the enterprise value of Gala Radio operating one or more networks, depending on the Scenarios, to the estimated enterprise value of Gala Radio as it operates today. In order to do so, Goldmedia carried out its analysis through the following steps:\n\n- it assessed the incremental revenues, depending on each Scenario; the evaluation of the future revenues was done with a bottom-up approach, *e.g.* taking as its starting point not the actual performance by Gala Radio, but rather business ratios and operating figures from benchmark radio networks218;\n\n- it then assessed the incremental costs for each Scenario;\n\n- it next calculated the free cash flows for each year from 2001 up to 2015 and, using DCF methodology, established its net present value;\n\n- the terminal value of the investment in 2015 was calculated by multiplying the free cash flow in that year by seven;\n\n- net present value plus discounted terminal value were added, to establish enterprise value;\n\n- enterprise value for Scenario I (Gala Radio \"as is\") was deducted from enterprise value for each of Scenarios II through IV A), and thus the amount of damages was established.\n\nGSR, p. 12.\n\n220.\n\nThe final total damages derived under each Scenario were the following:\n\n- Scenario II: 30,469,000 USD219;  \n- Scenario III: 40,402,000 USD220;  \n- Scenario IV: 46,651,000 USD221;  \n- Scenario IV A): 43,617,000 USD222.\n\nGSR, p. 67.\n\nGSR, p. 68.\n\nGSR, p. 68.\n\nGSR, p. 77.\n\nRevenue and Costs Forecast\n--------------------------\n\n221.\n\nAll hypothetical Scenarios were based on bottom-up revenue calculations223, taking the advertising prices of the first movers in the radio market (HIT, Russkoye, Nashe and Europa Plus224) and on an estimation of the additional costs which a national network would generate.\n\nAn alternative top down approach was abandoned in the GSR.\n\nGSR, p. 36.\n\nDiscount Rate\n-------------\n\n222.\n\nFor its calculations, Goldmedia used discount rates obtained applying the methodology of the US National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts [\"NACVA\"]225. Goldmedia used Category 1 ***(i.e.*** least risky company) for the hypothetical Scenarios II - IV A), and Category 2 ***(i.e.*** somewhat more risk) for Scenario I ***(i.e.*** for Gala Radio \"as is\")226.\n\nGSR, p. 13.\n\nHTRI, p. 178.\n\n223.\n\nAs an alternative, and in order to meet criticism by Respondent\u2019s expert, Goldmedia also introduced an alternative valuation based on discounted rates including a separate country risk premium, as calculated by Prof. Aswath Damodaran227 [\"Bludgeon Approach\"]. Applying discount rates adapted from Prof. Damodaran\u2019s approach, the total damages would be reduced to the following amounts228:\n\n- Scenario II: 26,791,000 USD;  \n- Scenario III: 35,303,000 USD;  \n- Scenario IV: 40,696,000 USD;  \n- Scenario IV A): 38,066,000 USD229.\n\nGSR, p. 18.\n\nGSR, pp. 71 to 73.\n\nGSR, p. 78.\n\nCurrency\n--------\n\n224.\n\nIn its Supplementary Report, Goldmedia carried out all the relevant calculations in UAH, while only final results were converted and discounted into USD230. EBITDA Valuation\n\nGSR, p. 11.\n\nEBITDA Valuation\n----------------\n\n225.\n\nTo cross check the findings of the DCF valuation, Goldmedia also carried out an EBITDA valuation, applying an 8.0 multiple, which it describes as a very moderate and conservative multiple231. Taking Scenario II, the total enterprise value for 2007 would have been 34,983,000 USD and for 2008 30,960,000 USD. Goldmedia submits that these figures confirm its damage calculation (which showed a figure for this Scenario II of approximately 30 M USD). Goldmedia also acknowledges that for 2009 the EBITDA valuation only provides a total enterprise value of 16,739,000 USD, which does not match the damage valuation. In Goldmedia\u2019s opinion, this lack of confirmation is attributable to the severe economic crisis which in 2009 affected Ukraine232.\n\nGSR, p. 26.\n\nGSR, p. 69.\n\nGala\u2019s P & L 2008/2009\n----------------------\n\n226.\n\nGala incurred a negative EBI (net earnings)233 both in 2008 (-1,691,000 UAH) and 2009 (-859,000 UAH). The losses in the first year are attributable - in Goldmedia\u2019s opinion - to a substantial increase in research and marketing expenses, caused by a repositioning of music format and brand image entrusted to Brand Support, and in the second year to the general crisis which hit Ukraine.\n\nGSR, p.34.\n\n**B. EBS\u2019 Calculations**\n------------------------\n\n227.\n\nEBS accepts Goldmedia\u2019s position that the appropriate methodology to calculate damages must be based on comparing Gala Radio\u2019s \"as is\" situation, with hypothetical Scenarios, applying a DCF analysis. Respondent\u2019s expert, however, disagrees with the system adopted by Goldmedia to value Gala Radio, which implied measuring Gala Radio\u2019s enterprise value, *i.e.* the sum of the net present value of future free cash flow, plus the present value of the terminal value in year 2015. EBS recommends the adoption of a lost profit approach, which (using the same methodology used by Claimant\u2019s expert) calculates the net present value of future free cash flow, the fundamental difference being that no terminal value is added234.\n\nESR, pp. 12 and 13.\n\n228.\n\nIf this alternative methodology is adopted, the amount of damages is significantly reduced; as EBS concludes235:\n\n- Scenario II: 11,946,000 USD;  \n- Scenario III: 14,432,000 USD;  \n- Scenario IV: 16,224,600 USD;  \n- Scenario IV A: 15,297,000 USD.\n\nESR, p.13.\n\nCurrency\n--------\n\n229.\n\nEBS disagrees with Goldmedia as to the application of the UAH instead of the USD and submits that Goldmedia\u2019s mixed approach, relying alternatively on UAH or USD, is misleading236. Goldmedia converts the UAH denominated discounted cash flows of each year into dollars at a fixed and predetermined exchange rate of 8 UAH to 1 USD. In EBS\u2019 opinion, this approach renders the calculations unreliable, because neither the country itself nor world financial institutions are able to give reliable forecasts in relation to the Ukrainian currency. A more consistent approach would have been to do the whole damage assessment in UAH and after applying the appropriate discount rate, convert the final UAH amount into USD at today\u2019s exchange rate237.\n\nESR, p. 16.\n\nHTRI, p. 202; Ms. Volska had some doubts whether the appropriate rate should be that as of the award or that as of the date of actual payment.\n\nDiscount Rate\n-------------\n\n230.\n\nEBS submits that the NACVA approach to establishing discount rates is only correct for developed countries, and that in developing countries like Ukraine the Bludgeon Approach pioneered by Prof. Damodaran is more appropriate. This latter methodology includes a country risk, which reflects the difference of running similar businesses in different countries, and also the exchange rate risk. Nor does EBS agree with Goldmedia\u2019s attempt at proposing an alternative calculation using the Bludgeon Approach, because it finds that Goldmedia is using Prof. Damodaran\u2019s *formulae* incorrectly. Applying this system in what EBS deems the appropriate fashion, EBS arrives at a discount rate of 18.51%. EBS submits that if this alternative were applied, without changing any of Goldmedia\u2019s other assumptions, the actual damages would be 33% lower than those presented by Goldmedia in its GSR238.\n\nESR, p. 21.\n\nValuation Through Comparable Transactions\n-----------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nEBS also presented an alternative valuation based on recent mergers and acquisitions of radio companies in Ukraine239. Some information about these deals is available in open sources and in the press, but the terms of significant transactions are confidential and the public information is not always reliable. Taking into consideration the available information, and assuming that Gala Radio as a national radio network with a second FM network and an AM talk radio would have reached a 5% market share, EBS comes to the conclusion that its market value could not exceed 6 M USD240, while the value of Gala Radio \"as is\" would amount to 1.5 M USD.\n\nESR, p. 25.\n\nESR, p. 27.\n\n232.\n\nUnder this methodology, the detriment suffered by the investor would be equal to 4.5 M USD (the difference between the enterprise of Gala Radio \"as is\" and the hypothetical enterprise value if it had developed three networks and reached a 5% market share).\n\nUndervaluation of Gala Radio\u2019s Official Figures\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nEBS submits that, in order to dodge taxes, most of the Ukrainian media market is not working in a transparent way and that revenues and salaries declared in official statements prepared by media companies are understated241. In EBS\u2019 opinion this also applies to Gala Radio.\n\nESR, p. 31.\n\n234.\n\nBased on this premise, and using information from other competitors and from MediaMonitor, EBS calculates that Gala Radio\u2019s 2009 underreported income was 7.2 M UAH (the official revenues being 5.6 M UAH)242. EBS also concludes that personnel costs were underreported, in order to avoid payroll tax. In EBS\u2019 opinion, this is proven by the fact that a significant portion of personnel (about 75 - 80%) is working at the minimum wage salary level, and all personnel is being paid at a level that was significantly below the average market level243.\n\nESR, pp. 34 and 35.\n\nESR, p. 36.\n\nCriticism of Different Scenarios\n--------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nEBS voices a significant number of criticisms with regard to each of the Scenarios developed by Goldmedia:\n\n236.\n\nWith regard to Scenario I\u00a0EBS is of the opinion that Gala Radio\u2019s past financial performance is underreported. If Gala Radio\u2019s financial statements are restated, this would show that Gala Radio is more profitable than what Goldmedia is assuming, thus reducing the amount of damages. Taking Scenario II as an example, the restatement of Gala Radio\u2019s financial statements in Scenario I would result in a reduction of the total damages to 22,967,860 USD244.\n\nESR, p.38.\n\n237.\n\nScenario II is also criticised by EBS for a number of reasons245:\n\n- 2001 - 2006 numbers are based on 2007 rates, deflated by US average consumer price index, not by the Ukrainian domestic inflation rate;\n\n- Goldmedia\u2019s proposed average rate for Kyiv is 49% higher than Gala Radio\u2019s actual rate, without any support for this increase;\n\n- the benchmark radios should be Hit and Europa Plus, excluding Nashe and Russkoe Radio;\n\n- personnel costs are underestimated and must be increased to reflect reality.\n\nESR, p. 40.\n\n238.\n\nThese changes alone would result in a reduction of damages to 18,528,830 USD246.\n\nESR, p. 44.\n\n239.\n\nIn Scenario III, EBS objects that the forecasted revenues for the second FM network are higher than Gala Radio\u2019s actual revenues for the same relevant year. In EBS\u2019 opinion, Kiss is not the appropriate benchmark to be used to assess potential rates for the second FM network. Goldmedia\u2019s projection for the advertising load is aggressive and EBS suggests a more reasonable increase. EBS also disagrees with the proposed CAPEX expenditures, and suggests decreasing the time span by one year and increasing the personnel costs. These changes would result in a reduction of damages to 30,339,420 USD247 (from a maximum calculated by Goldmedia of 40,402,000 USD248).\n\nESR, p. 47.\n\nESR, p. 37.\n\n240.\n\nAs regards Scenarios IV and IV A, EBS disagrees with Goldmedia\u2019s proposed plan of converting the AM frequency to an FM format in 2006 and also with the Era Radio rates quoted by Goldmedia249. In EBS\u2019 opinion, the AM format is generally considered commercially unjustified because the target audience is mostly the rural population, which is not of high interest for commercial advertisers and commands lower advertising rates; furthermore, AM requires significant additional CAPEX investments. Evidence of this is provided by the fact that tenders for AM frequencies frequently could not be held, as there were no applicants. There is only one commercial AM operator in Ukraine, Radio Majak, and most AM broadcasters are motivated by non-commercial objectives. EBS also proposes that a number of assumptions regarding personnel cost, time span and price growth be adjusted.\n\nESR, p. 47.\n\n241.\n\nSumming up, EBS is of the opinion that if Gala Radio had operated an AM network it would have incurred constant losses250. If it is assumed that Gala Radio would have switched its AM format to FM, then EBS anticipates that the total damages would have amounted to 36,294,600 USD251 (and not 46,651,000 USD as proposed by Goldmedia252).\n\nESR, p. 50.\n\nESR, p. 51.\n\nESR, p. 37.\n\nAlternative Calculations\n------------------------\n\n242.\n\nEBS also performed an alternative assessment of damages, outlined in two Scenarios:\n\n- a bottom-up approach based on Goldmedia\u2019s approach but using EBS assumptions; this leads, for Scenario II, to a calculation of damages amounting to 190,490 USD253;\n\n- a top-down approach based on the original methodology used by Goldmedia in its first report, but using EBS assumptions and a 5% annual market growth rate; with this methodology and taking again Scenario II as an example, the damages would amount to 2,805,630 USD254.\n\nESR, p. 53.\n\nESR, p. 54.\n\n**3.4. Determination of the Compensation by the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe main finding in the Tribunal\u2019s First Decision was that Gala Radio, although it tried insistently for six years, and presented more than 200 applications for all types of frequencies, was prevented, because of wrongful actions of the National Council, from obtaining a single licence (except for one in a small village in rural Ukraine)255. If it had not been for this delictual treatment, Gala Radio would now be a bigger, more profitable and more valuable radio operator.\n\nFirst Decision, paras. 420 and 451.\n\n244.\n\nThe damage suffered by Claimant can thus be defined as the difference between a real \"as is\" value of Gala Radio - what the investor now actually owns - and a hypothetical \"but for\" value - what the investor would have owned if the host State had respected the BIT256. This second evaluation requires that the Tribunal assume that the National Council had acted in a way different from its actual behaviour. But this is not the only relevant factor. Broadcasting is a heavily regulated and supervised business. There is an interrelation between the actions of the regulator and the decisions of the regulated entities. If the National Council had acted in a different manner, Claimant would also have in all likelihood taken different decisions. When reconstructing the \"but for\" scenario, the Tribunal must assume not only that the Ukrainian authorities adhered to the BIT standards, but also that Claimant reacted in the manner to be expected from a diligent and reasonable investor *(i.e.* making the CAPEX investments required to operate the radio licences).\n\nSee para. 161 *supra.*\n\nIs the damage speculative ?\n---------------------------\n\n245.\n\nRespondent has drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the statement of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Amoco v. Iran257* that:\n\n*\"[o]ne of the best settled rules of the law of international responsibility of States is that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damage can be awarded\".*\n\nThe same idea is expressed in Article 36.2 of the ILCA Articles, which provides that *\"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established)* As the Commentary notes, *\"Tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherent speculative elements\"258.*\n\n*Amoco International Finance Corp. v. Iran,* (Iran United States Claims Tribunal Case No. 56), Partial Award of July 14, 1987, *[\"Amoco\"],* para 238.\n\nJames Crawford: \"The international Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility\", 2002, para. 27.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the *in bonis* party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss259.\n\nMark Kantor: \"Valuation for Arbitration\", 2008, [\"Kantor\"], p. 72; Jan Paulsson: \"The Expectation Model\" in \"Evaluation of Damages in International Arbitration\", (Yves Derains and Richard H. Kreindler Eds.), 2006, p. 60.\n\n247.\n\nIn our case, it is the Tribunal\u2019s firm conviction, based on the available evidence, that Claimant has indeed suffered a loss, resulting from Gala Radio\u2019s curtailed growth, and consequent loss of value, and that the proximate cause of the loss were the wrongful actions of Respondent.\n\n248.\n\nWhile the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of the compensation is fraught with much more difficulty, inherent in the very nature of the \"but for\" hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science. The Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have happened under a hypothesis of no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who assesses the value of a business on the basis of its likely future earnings.\n\n249.\n\nThe issues surrounding the measure of compensation for breaches of the FET standard are - as the Tribunal in *LG & E* said - *\"particularly thorny\"260.* To estimate the damages, the Tribunal will inevitably have to accept certain assumptions. These assumptions can and must be checked, applying tests of reasonableness. But in the end, there is no denying that the calculation of damages in a case like this, inevitably requires a certain amount of conjecture as to how things would have evolved \"but for\" the actual behaviour of the parties. This difficulty in calculation cannot, however, deprive an investor, who has suffered injury, from his fundamental right to see his losses redressed.\n\n*LG & E,* para. 30.\n\nIs the damage a loss of chance?\n-------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s certainty that Claimant has indeed suffered a loss has another important implication: it excludes the possibility that Mr. Lemire\u2019s injury be classified as a simple loss of chance.\n\n251.\n\nCompensation for a lost chance is admissible, and is normally calculated as the hypothetical maximum loss, multiplied by the probability of the chance coming to fruition261. To take the example given in the Official Comment to the UNIDROIT Principles262:\n\n*\"[T]he owner of a horse which arrives too late to run in a race as a result of delay in transport cannot recover the whole prize money, even though the horse was the favourite\".*\n\nIn this example, the owner must be satisfied with compensation proportionate to the probability of the win.\n\nKantor, p. 74.\n\nPrinciples of International Commercial Contracts adopted by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law [\"UNIDROIT Principles\"], Article 7.4.3(2).\n\n252.\n\nBut the facts of our case do not fit the example: the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is not that Gala Radio was relegated in certain specific tenders for frequencies, and was deprived of a chance to win in these procedures; what the Tribunal has found is that the initial cause (Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts) and the damage (Claimant\u2019s frustration to carry out his plans and create a nationwide FM channel plus an AM informational channel) are linked through a proximate chain of causation. The investor\u2019s loss does not consist in being deprived of some chance to win additional frequencies; what has been proven is that Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts have resulted, through a foreseeable and proximate chain of events, in the damage suffered by the investor.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s task\n-------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe compensation to which Mr. Lemire is entitled is the loss of value which his investment has suffered, and this loss must be established by subtracting the actual value of Gala Radio in its \"as is\" condition from the hypothetical value of the investment \"but for\" the wrongful acts of Respondent. This task has been addressed by the experts appointed by each party, who acquitted themselves to a very professional standard, but nevertheless came to strikingly different results (with Goldmedia arriving at figures of between 30 and almost 50 M USD263, and EBS of significantly less than 0.5 M USD264).\n\nGSR, p. 6.\n\nESR, p. 52.\n\n254.\n\nThe only aspect on which both experts have agreed is that the appropriate methodology to establish the damage in a case like this one is a DCF analysis. This methodology, based on the prediction of a future stream of cash flow, which is then discounted at a given rate, has been acknowledged and frequently applied in the recent practice of investment arbitration265. Given this acceptance and the common proposal of both experts, the Tribunal sees no difficulty in using a DCF methodology. The Tribunal will thus adopt the basic philosophy proposed by the experts, but will critically review their assumptions and calculations.\n\nMarboe, p. 209.\n\n**B. Selection of a Scenario**\n------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nAs explained above266, Goldmedia compared Scenario I, which represents Gala Radio in \"as is\" conditions, with one of four hypothetical Scenarios, numbered II, III, IV and IV A) which represent the \"but for\" situation. The Tribunal\u2019s first task is to determine which, if any, of these four alternatives may serve as a foundation for the most plausible assessment of damages.\n\nSee para. 218 *supra.*\n\n256.\n\n**Scenario II** assumes the existence of a national FM channel as of 2001. The Scenario thus correctly reflects the Tribunal\u2019s assumption that, had Respondent not engaged in irregular practices during the Interregnum, Gala should have received, by January 1, 2001, the 14 frequencies required to operate a nationwide FM music network267.\n\nSee para. 179 *supra.*\n\n257.\n\n**Scenario III** adds to Scenario II the existence of a second FM radio network for young audiences, which would have been granted to Gala Radio. The Tribunal has concluded that Claimant\u2019s initial plans did not include the creation of a second FM network, that there is no causal link between the violation and the inexistence of this second network and that consequently this unforeseeable and remote factor must be excluded from the calculation of damages268.\n\nSee para. 162 *supra.*\n\n258.\n\n**Scenario IV** adds to Scenario III the existence of a nationwide AM radio network with talk radio. Since the Arbitral Tribunal has already rejected Scenario III, the possibility of accepting Scenario IV becomes moot.\n\n259.\n\n**Scenario IV A)** adds to Scenario II - which has already been accepted - the existence of a nationwide AM radio network with talk radio. The Tribunal has already decided that, absent the National Council\u2019s wrongdoing, Gala would have received in 2004 the necessary authorisation to incorporate an AM network269. Consequently, Scenario IV A) is the one which, *prima facie,* best represents Claimant\u2019s initial plans and which could serve as basis for the calculation of damages.\n\nSee para. 201 *supra.*\n\n260.\n\nScenario IV A), however, suffers important shortcomings, due to the particular difficulties of establishing a proper DCF value for an AM channel:\n\n- in Ukraine most AM channels are operated by non profit organisations270, there being only one commercial AM network, Radio Majak, and its reach is not comparable to that which Gala Radio could have obtained271; there is a lack of comparable entities to perform a bottom up calculation of revenues, with the result that the projected income of an AM channel in Ukraine cannot be predicted with a minimum level of certainty;\n\n- secondly, the audience which uses AM receivers is mostly the rural population, which is not of high interest for commercial advertisers; when\n\n- AM frequencies were put out to tender, in many cases the tender process could not be concluded, as there were no applicants272;\n\n- thirdly, Goldmedia itself acknowledges the economic difficulties of AM channels, and in its GSR for the first time includes the assumption that the AM frequency would have been converted into an FM licence in 2006273; this assumption is speculative, because there is no evidence that Gala Radio had at any time envisaged such a switch.\n\nConfirmed by Dr. Wiegand, HTRI, p. 177.\n\nESR, p. 50.\n\nESR, p. 48 and Appendix B 5.\n\nGSR, p. 10; HTRI, p. 175.\n\n261.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Scenario IV A) is too uncertain, because it incorporates a type of business - broadcasting talk radio on AM band in Ukraine - which has not been developed on a commercial for profit basis in Ukraine, and for which it is impossible to prepare a DCF valuation without an intolerable level of speculation. Consequently, the Tribunal will opt for the most conservative Scenario and adopt Scenario II, which foresees Gala Radio as a full national broadcaster but without an AM channel. The Tribunal finds that in this Scenario the projections for income and costs offer a much higher level of certainty, and that the requirement that speculative losses be excluded from the calculation is better served. Besides, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the existence of an AM talk radio channel would have produced significant additional net income.\n\n**C. The Calculation of Gala Radio\u2019s \"Enterprise Value\"**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nGoldmedia calculated the value of Gala Radio under Scenario II using an \"enterprise value\" methodology274. This methodology is based on two elements:\n\n- the discounted free cash flow, which represents the cash flow available for distribution among all the securities holders of an enterprise, discounted at the corresponding discount rate; and\n\n- the discounted terminal value, which is the value that the enterprise would be worth at the end of the valuation horizon, similarly discounted.\n\nDifferent valuation methodologies in these situations are described in Kantor, p. 42.\n\n263.\n\nIn order to obtain the **discounted free cash flow,** the report applied the following steps:\n\n- it first estimated Gala Radio\u2019s EBITDA in UAH for the years 2001 - 2015;\n\n- it then deducted the taxes for that period of time;\n\n- it so obtained the operating cash flow of Gala Radio;\n\n- the next step consisted in subtracting capital expenditures, which it assumed only occurred in 2001;\n\n- thus obtaining the free cash flow for each year in UAH;\n\n- which is then converted into USD;\n\n- discounted at 13.46%;\n\n- resulting in a net present value of **12,515,000 USD.**\n\n264.\n\nGoldmedia equates the **terminal value** to the discounted free cash flow in 2015 multiplied by an estimated further company lifetime of seven years (assuming a typical licence period)275. This rather simple definition turns into more complex calculations276:\n\n- the discounted free cash flow in 2015 has been calculated as 6,087,000 USD277;\n\n- the report divides this amount by 0.3258;\n\n- this number is obtained through the following formula:\n\nDiscount interest rate \\* (1 + discount interest rate) ^ further company lifetime = 13.46% \\* (1+13.46%)^7\n\n- the terminal value is thus fixed at **18,682,000 USD.**\n\nGFR, p. 18, HTRI, p. 128.\n\nThe formula applied is available at the excel spread sheet of damage calculation provided by Goldmedia on October 10, 2008.\n\nGSR, p. 67.\n\n265.\n\nGoldmedia added the two elements to establish Gala Radio\u2019s \"as of\u2019 \"enterprise value\" of 31,198,000 USD278, deducted from this amount the \"enterprise value\" in \"as is\" conditions, 728,000 USD, and thus calculated the total damage for Scenario II as 30,469,000 USD279.\n\n(12,515,000 USD + 18,682,000 USD = 31,198,000 USD). The slight differences in the above amounts are a result of the rounding of numbers by Claimant\u2019s expert.\n\nGSR, p. 67; again there are differences caused by the rounding of numbers.\n\n266.\n\nEBS disagrees with this \"enterprise value\" methodology and has advocated that the valuation be performed using a \"lost profits\" approach instead. Under this approach, damages would be calculated on the basis of the discounted free cash flows from 2001 through 2015280, without taking into consideration any terminal value. EBS has not disputed Goldmedia\u2019s proposal that the basis of the DCF analysis should be the free cash flow available to Gala Radio (and not EBIT or any other similar accounting concept).\n\nEBS agrees for the Scenario II with the 2001 to 2015 time span; see ESR, p. 17.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Position\n-----------------------\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent\u2019s expert, EBS, that the terminal value should not be added when calculating the damages. The Tribunal bases its decision on the following reasons:\n\n268.\n\n(i) In first instance, the Tribunal notes that under the Goldmedia methodology the terminal value is by far the most important element in the establishment of the \"enterprise value\"; thus it is fundamental that the quantification of this element is sufficiently certain; in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this requirement is not met, since the terminal value is calculated using the estimation for the 2015 free cash flow and then multiplying this already rather uncertain figure by a factor - a product of the expert\u2019s personal judgement - of seven; thus any inaccuracy in the calculation of the 2015 cash flow provokes a multiplied effect in the terminal value281.\n\nAcknowledged by Dr. Wiegand, HTRI, p. 129.\n\n269.\n\n(ii) Secondly, although it is rational in principle that someone assessing the value of a business today would consider not only the value of an income stream from today until 2015, but would also project net income from that year forward as establishing a residual additional present value, the Tribunal does not view Gala Radio in this light. The evidence, particularly witness testimony, in this case creates an irresistible impression that Gala Radio\u2019s fortunes depend on the initiatives and personal commitment of Mr. Lemire. Gala Radio cannot be described as an institutionalised enterprise, nor can the industry or environment in which it operates be described as one that gives assurance of such a corporate evolution.\n\n270.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal believes that the case of Gala Radio presents in a rather emphatic way the problem of the \"succession factor\" present in the valuation of family-owned small-to-medium businesses, and on that basis sees no warrant to endorse Claimant\u2019s inclusion of a residual value beyond the one that reflects lost value until the 2015 horizon. The Tribunal is aware that this is quite a conservative approach, in effect giving no credit for possible profit beyond a five-year period, but believes it appropriate in the circumstances of this case.\n\n271.\n\nIf EBS\u2019s \"lost profit\" methodology is applied in Scenario II, and all other parameters and conditions in Goldmedia\u2019s calculation are preserved, the amount of damages suffered by Claimant is reduced to 12,388,000 USD (the result of subtracting a Scenario I net present value of 127,000 USD from a Scenario II net present value of 12,515,000 USD282).\n\nGSR p. 67; ESR, p. 13 arrives at slightly different figure, because it applies a different discount rate.\n\n**D. Application of UAH v. USD**\n--------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nIn GFR, Goldmedia\u2019s original 2008 Report, USD was the main currency for the presentation of Gala Radio\u2019s historical financial statements and the currency for forecasts and valuations. That approach may have seemed reasonable, because until the recent financial crisis the Hryvnia was relatively constant vis-\u00e0-vis the USD283. In 2008, however, the Ukrainian currency suffered a major and rapid devaluation of up to 40% and prices uncoupled from the USD284. As a consequence of these changes, in its final presentation Goldmedia switched currencies. For historical periods of up to 2008 inclusive, Goldmedia first took Gala Radio\u2019s actual cash flows in UAH, and then converted them into USD at the historic exchange rate. All *post* 2008 cash flows are calculated in UAH, and then translated into USD at a forecasted exchange rate of 8 UAH/USD285; the annual free cash flows denominated in USD are finally discounted at the appropriate discount rate286.\n\nHTRI, p. 138.\n\nHTRI, p. 141.\n\nESR, p. 16.\n\nAcknowledged by Dr. Wiegand, HTRI, p. 138.\n\n273.\n\nEBS has submitted that there is a methodological flaw in the way Goldmedia is using the different currencies. The Tribunal disagrees, and on this issue sides with Goldmedia.\n\n274.\n\nFor reason to be explained below, the Tribunal will adopt Prof. Damodaran\u2019s approach for calculating the discount rate, and will accept EBS\u2019s number, established under this methodology, of 18.51%. This rate is the result of adding a Riskfree Rate based on the ROI287 of US Bonds, a Mature Market Premium based on the US market, plus a Country Risk Premium of 7.43%. Since the Risk Free rate is expressed in nominal *(i.e.* without taking into account the effect of inflation) Dollar terms, consistency requires that discounted cash flows also be expressed in nominal Dollars288. In Goldmedia\u2019s model, the cash flows are expressed in nominal Hryvnias, and then converted into Dollars at a fixed exchange rate. Goldmedia has chosen 8 UAH/USD, which reflects present market situations, and EBS has not proposed an alternative calculation. All in all, the Tribunal finds that Goldmedia is using Dollars and Hryvnias in a consistent way and that Goldmedia\u2019s application of the UAH/USD exchange rate is reasonable.\n\nReturn on Investment [\"ROI\"].\n\nAswath Damodaran: \"Estimating Risk free Rates\", Paper, p. 5, available at http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/riskfree.pdf.\n\n**E. Discount Rate**\n--------------------\n\n275.\n\nGoldmedia and EBS disagree on the discount rate to be applied in the DCF model.\n\nNACVA\n-----\n\n276.\n\nGoldmedia initially applied NACVA methodology289, a rather simple system, based on five defined risk categories. Claimant\u2019s expert used Category 1 **(i.e.** least risky company) for the hypothetical Scenarios II - IV A), and Category 2 *(i.e.* slightly more risk) for Scenario I **(i.e.** for Gala Radio \"as is\")290. By picking a higher, riskier discount rate for Scenario I compared to Scenarios II through IV A), the valuation performed by Goldmedia increased the amount of damages291.\n\nGSR, p. 13.\n\nHTRI, p. 178.\n\nHTRI, p. 180 and 181.\n\n277.\n\nThe overall discount rate used by Goldmedia in the GSR added up for Scenarios II through IV A) to 13.46%292. In Goldmedia\u2019s opinion, the reasonableness of this rate was confirmed in the 2008 IPO293 in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange of the company UMH, in which Concorde Capital, in order to value the company, applied an average discount rate for 2009 - 2012 of 13%. The discount used for Scenario I is 18.46%.\n\nGSR, p. 15.\n\n\"Initial Public Offering\"; GSR, p. 67.\n\n278.\n\nEBS submits that the NACVA approach for establishing discount rates is only correct for developed countries, but that in developing countries like Ukraine the Bludgeon Approach pioneered by Prof. Damodaran is more appropriate. EBS adds that, even if the NACVA methodology is selected, Claimant\u2019s expert is applying it incorrectly, because the same discount rate must be used both for Scenario I and for all the remaining Scenarios. The use of a higher discount rate for Gala Radio \"as is\" increases the difference in valuation between Scenario I and all other Scenarios.\n\n279.\n\nOn this issue, the Tribunal sides with EBS.\n\n280.\n\nNACVA represents a domestic methodology, which is appropriate to value companies in the US and possibly in other developed nations. It does not, however, reflect country risk, *i.e.* the fact that the same company, situated in the US or in Ukraine, is subject to different political and regulatory risks; to reflect this difference, *ceteris paribus* the discount rate in Ukraine must be higher (and the valuations lower) than in the US The NACVA approach does not acknowledge this difference, while the Damodaran methodology includes a specific item to reflect country risk and thus is to be preferred.\n\n281.\n\nGoldmedia has argued that if the investor had sold Gala Radio, the buyer would have been a domestic player, which would not take country risk into account294. The Tribunal is unconvinced: a buyer will rationally pay more when investing in the equity of companies located in nations with low country risk.\n\nGSR, p. 18.\n\nProf. Damodaran\u2019s Approach\n--------------------------\n\n282.\n\nEBS already proposed in its first report that the appropriate methodology for calculating the discount rate is Prof. Damodaran\u2019s approach. Aswath Damodaran is a Professor at Stern School of Business, NY, and a prominent authority in the valuation of companies and cash flows and the creator of a frequently used web page with *formulae* and data295. Both experts agree that, in accordance with his methodology, the cost of equity is equal to the sum of:\n\n- the Riskfree Rate, based on the ROI of US bonds;\n\n- a Beta (namely the stock price volatility of individual equities) multiplied by a Mature Market Premium, based on the US market; and\n\n- a Country Risk Premium, which is dependent on the country in which the investment is located.\n\nhttp://pages.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar.\n\n283.\n\nIn its GSR Goldmedia accepted the Bludgeon Approach, as an alternative to the NACVA system, and submitted a calculation of the discount rate based on Prof. Damodaran\u2019s methodology296. Goldmedia used the average Beta of all stock companies operating in all industries in Central and Eastern Europe, as listed in Prof. Damodaran\u2019s homepage. The result was a total discount rate, which would be different for each year between 2001 and 2015, and which would float between 10.81% for 2005 and 16.10 % for 2010297.\n\nGSR, p. 18.\n\nGSR, p. 24.\n\n284.\n\nIn its second report, while welcoming the use by Goldmedia of the Damodaran approach, EBS disagreed with Goldmedia\u2019s alternative calculation, because in its opinion Goldmedia was using Prof. Damodaran\u2019s *formulae* incorrectly. Applying the system in what EBS deemed the appropriate fashion, EBS arrived at a uniform discount rate of 18.51%298.\n\nESR, p. 21.\n\n285.\n\nNot without hesitation, the Tribunal prefers EBS\u2019 calculation of the discount rate. The reasons are the following:\n\n- EBS\u2019 calculation of the Riskfree Rate is based on the exact data from the Prof. Damodaran\u2019s web site;\n\n- the Beta used by EBS for the broadcasting industry in developing markets appears to better reflect Gala Radio\u2019s risk than the Beta proposed by Goldmedia, which refers to all companies in Central and Eastern Europe;\n\n- EBS\u2019 use of a 10 year average of the Mature Market Premium is to be preferred to Goldmedia\u2019s proposal of selecting the Market Premium in one single year (2009).\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the appropriate discount rate, both for Scenario I and II, is 18.51%. Since the discount rate will be applied to a stream of nominal Dollars, the Tribunal finds that it is inappropriate that this rate be increased by the projected inflation rate in Ukraine.\n\n287.\n\nGoldmedia has drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the 2008 IPO in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange of the company UMH, in which Concorde Capital valued the company applying an average discount rate for 2009 - 2012 of 13%. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, it is not appropriate to compare Gala Radio with UMH, because UMH is a diversified holding, listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, while Gala Radio is a much smaller, undiversified radio broadcaster in Ukraine. Furthermore, as EBS has pointed out299, the UMH discount rate was estimated as weighted average cost of capital, whereas Gala Radio does not have any debt.\n\nESR, p. 24.\n\n**F. Determination of Free Cash Flow**\n--------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nAs in all other hypothetical Scenarios, Goldmedia has calculated Gala Radio\u2019s Scenario II income using a bottom-up approach300, *i.e.* applying the advertising prices of the first movers in the radio market (HIT, Russkoye, Nashe and Europa Plus)301. In Scenario II these calculations lead to the following predictions:\n\n- \"but for\" revenues in year 2008 would amount to 32,770,000 UAH and in 2015 to 81,116,000 UAH302;\n\n- \"but for\" costs for the same years would be 12,386,000 UAH and 16,322,000 UAH;\n\n- a predicted CAPEX investment of 2,757,430 UAH;\n\n- leading, after conversion of amounts denominated in Hryvnias into Dollars, to predicted free cash flow of 2,840,000 USD in 2008 and 6,087,000 USD in 2O15303.\n\nAn alternative top down approach was abandoned in the GSR.\n\nGSR, p. 36.\n\nGSR, p. 54.\n\nGSR, p. 67; EBS Appendix A-3 calculates the 2008 free cash flow as 2,839,900 USD and the 2015 free cash flow as 6,083,500 USD - possibly due to rounding discrepancies.\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the methodology used by Goldmedia when calculating Gala Radio\u2019s available free cash flows304. While it is true that some of the assumptions are debatable, the Tribunal finds that, all in all, the model created by Claimant\u2019s expert represents a fair estimate of how Gala Radio would have developed until 2015, if it had been awarded the necessary licences to become a national network in 2001. In the opinion of the Tribunal, in that case, and with the additional support of a talk radio in AM format, it is reasonable to project that Gala Radio would have managed to produce a free cash flow of roughly 3 M USD in 2008 and of 6 M USD in 2015. To achieve these results, Mr. Lemire would have needed to provide an additional funding for CAPEX of 2,757,430 UAH (less than 350,000 USD) - an investment which appears to be within his financial capabilities.\n\nGSR, pp. 36 to 38.\n\nCriticism by EBS\n----------------\n\n290.\n\nEBS has criticized Goldmedia\u2019s cash flow predictions for a number of reasons305:\n\nESR, p. 40.\n\n291.\n\nEBS argues first of all that the 2001 - 2006 numbers are based on 2007 rates, deflated by US average consumer price index, not by the Ukrainian domestic inflation rate. The Tribunal does not share EBS\u2019 argument, because until 2008 prices in Ukraine fluctuated consistently with the Dollar, and thus it is logical to apply US inflation rates before that year.\n\n292.\n\nSecondly, EBS submits that Goldmedia\u2019s proposed average rate for Kyiv is 49% higher than Gala Radio\u2019s actual rate, without any justification, and that the benchmark radios should be Hit and Europa Plus, not Nashe and Russkoe Radio. The Tribunal again disagrees, and accepts Goldmedia\u2019s detailed calculations explained in Exhibit 29 to its GSR306. Goldmedia has factored in that the increase in the advertising prices will not be higher than the expected inflation307, and has taken the average price of the first four movers308 - all reasonable assumptions.\n\nGSR, p. 39.\n\nGSR, p. 36.\n\nHTRI, p. 165.\n\n293.\n\nThirdly, EBS has stated that Gala Radio\u2019s official accounting underreports income and underestimates personnel costs, and that Gala Radio\u2019s books are not reliable. EBS made this allegation for the first time in its final report, but did not present any hard evidence in support. EBS simply asserts that most of the Ukrainian media market is working in a non-transparent way and that 75 - 80% of Gala Radio\u2019s employees are working at the minimum wage salary level309. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this is clearly insufficient to prove the serious allegation that the whole Ukrainian media sector, including Gala Radio, is working with two sets of accounting books - one official, but false, the other unofficial but correct310.\n\nESR, p. 36.\n\nDr. Voss in his Separate Opinion submits that \"[h]owever, *the financial statements are bound to be inaccurate since they fail to reflect Claimant\u2019s actual contributions to Gala and thus overstate its profits or understate its losses, as the cast may be\"* (para. 372). The Tribunal has concluded that Mr. Lemire\u2019s personal assets and those of Gala Radio are somewhat commingled, and that Mr. Lemire has invested approximately 2.4 M USD of his own monies, which are not reflected in Gala\u2019s balance sheet. The Tribunal consequently agrees with Dr. Voss\u2019 statement. But Dr. Voss then takes his argument one step further, concluding that Gala\u2019s *\"profits and loss accounts [...] were evidently inaccurate\"* (para. 373). This statement is unproven. There is no evidence on the record quantifying the impact on the profit and loss account, if Mr. Lemire\u2019s investments had actually been put on the balance sheet of the company. The issue has not been addressed by any of the experts. Neither have the alternatives for capitalization of the investments been discussed or analysed. Dr. Voss\u2019 estimate that capitalization would increase losses is unproven speculation.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is reinforced by the testimony of Dr. Wiegand, Claimant\u2019s expert. Asked by counsel, he confirmed that he had not found any irregularities in Gala Radio\u2019s accounts and that all financial statements which he had been shown were audited by an independent certified accountant311.\n\nHTRI, p. 122.\n\n295.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal is satisfied that the free cash flow predictions made by Claimant\u2019s expert with regard to Scenarios I and II are reasonable, that they present a fair estimate of Gala Radio in \"as is\" and in \"but for\" conditions, and that these projections - summarized in Exhibit 50312 of Goldmedia\u2019s GSR - are the appropriate numerical basis for the DCF analysis313.\n\nGSR, p. 67.\n\nIn paras. 378 and 379 of his Separate Opinion, Dr. Voss adds one further criticism: in his opinion *\"past profits are the primary indicator of future profits* and since Gala Radio\u2019s earnings are volatile and there is an accumulated net loss for the entire period, in his opinion the estimates of lost profits are not supported by the earning record. The Tribunal agrees that under normal circumstances, lost future profits must be supported by a record of earnings. But what Dr. Voss does not see is that this general rule cannot be applied for the calculation of damages in cases of violation of the FET Standard. In these circumstances, damages must be established by deducting Gala\u2019s \"as is\" value, from its hypothetical \"but for\" value. The \"as is\" value will be low, because earnings will be depressed as a consequence of Respondent\u2019s wrongful actions. The \"but for\" value, however, has no relationship with Gala Radio\u2019s actual profits: it is premised on Gala\u2019s hypothetical (not on its actual) earnings record, if Ukraine had adhered to the FET Standard.\n\n**3.5. Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the correct discount rate is 18.51%, as calculated by EBS applying the Bludgeon Approach. This discount rate must be inserted into the Scenario I and II free cash flow predictions worked out by Goldmedia. This calculation is not available in the spread sheets prepared by Goldmedia - because Goldmedia uses a different discount rate - but it is provided by EBS in Appendix A - 3 to its ESR314. The resulting amounts (which have not been disputed by Claimant or by Goldmedia) are the following:\n\n- net present value of the discounted cash flows in Scenario I: 126,290 USD;\n\n- net present value of the discounted cash flows in Scenario II: 8,844,140 USD315;\n\n- loss suffered by the investor: 8,717,850 USD316.\n\nThe numbers used by Goldmedia and EBS are the same, with small rounding differences.\n\nIn para. 369 of his Separate Opinion, Dr. Voss states that *\"[i]n the Majority's determination, additional profits due to fourteen frequencies that Gala should have won during the Interregnum would have catapulted Gala\u2019s present enterprise value from USD 126,290 to 8,844,150, i.e., they would have multiplied Gala\u2019s value by 70. This conclusion in my view, reflects audacious speculation.\"* What Dr. Voss does not take into account is that the \"as is\" enterprise value is small, because Gala Radio has been affected by Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts. And the \"but for\" enterprise value is (comparatively) large, because as a broadcaster with nation-wide coverage Gala Radio would have been able to reap the benefit of economies of scale, applying the same rates for advertising as its privileged competitors and earning a much higher income, without significantly increasing its costs. The Tribunal, after carefully weighing the available evidence and analysing in detail the submission of both experts, is convinced that the free cash flow calculations made by Claimant\u2019s expert are fair and reasonable.\n\n8,844,140 USD - 126,290 USD.\n\n297.\n\nIn view of the above reasoning, the Tribunal concludes that the total compensation which Respondent is to pay to Claimant as a result of Respondent\u2019s violation of the FET standard defined in the BIT amounts to 8,717,850 USD317.\n\nIn paras. 540 to 545 of his Separate Opinion Dr. Voss includes certain references to European Procurement Law contained in Directive 92/13/EEC and to the 2009 German *\"Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen\".* These laws have not been pleaded by any of the parties, have never been discussed in the course of the arbitration until Dr. Voss presented his Separate Opinion and, in the opinion of the Tribunal, have no bearing whatsoever on the calculation of damages for an international wrong committed by Ukraine against an American investor.  \nFurthermore, Dr. Voss\u2019 assertion that under Directive 92/13/EEC Claimant\u2019s claims would be dismissed (i) because of Gala\u2019s failure to participate in the tenders, (ii) because of Gala\u2019s failure of proving a real chance in particular tenders and (iii) because any recovery is limited to *damnum emergens,* is but a personal and unsubstantiated opinion. Even if Directive 92/13/EEC had any relevance to the case *(quod non),* Dr. Voss\u2019s conclusions seem to be at odds with Article 2.1 (d) of the Directive which, in cases when a procurement decision has been declared illegal, does not limit the type of damages which can be awarded.  \nFinally, Dr. Voss\u2019 statement that para. 126 of the *\"Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen\"* limits any compensation to the expenses incurred, excluding *lucrum cessans,* is also his personal unproven opinion. The final words of para. 126 (\" *Weiterreichende Anspr\u00fcche auf Schadensersatz bleiben unber\u00fchrt\")* seem to imply the contrary.\n\n298.\n\nThe amount of damages has been established applying a DCF model, developed on a number of assumptions, some of which necessarily involve more estimation than certitude, and the resulting amounts are not free of doubt and debate. It is thus important that the overall result be tested against other parameters, in order to confirm the reasonability of the calculation.\n\nAmounts Invested\n----------------\n\n299.\n\n(i) The first test of reasonability involves comparing the compensation to be awarded with the amount invested by Claimant.\n\n300.\n\nInvestment and damages are of course separate concepts: investment refers to the resources which Claimant brought into Ukraine in order to create and fund Gala Radio, and damages to the loss of value which Gala Radio suffered as a consequence of the breaches in the BIT. Although the amounts invested do not constitute a ceiling to the compensation, there must, with respect to most enterprises, be a common sense correlation between both concepts: the amounts invested influence the size of the enterprise, and the size of the enterprise, together with the investor\u2019s activities and skills, define the earning expectations and the value of the business318. And in certain cases, arbitral tribunals have rejected calculations based on DCF methodology by reason of the disproportionality of the sums invested and the damages sought319.\n\nSome large corporate enterprises diversify discrete investments, accepting the high likelihood of zero returns for individual projects *(i.e.* costly dry holes in the petroleum industry) by reason of confidence in the probability that they will be compensated for by high returns on others. Claimant in this case was not a diversified investor of such dimensions.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award of December 8, 2000, para. 123; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales S.A. v. M\u00e9xico,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003, para. 186.\n\n301.\n\nThe true amounts invested have been much debated between the parties. Claimant has submitted that his total investment amounts to approximately 4.5 M USD, plus the personal dedication of Mr. Lemire, valued for a minimum of 5 M USD320. Respondent has acknowledged an investment of only 0.9 M USD321.\n\nCMRI, para. 22.\n\nRMRI, para. 121.\n\n302.\n\nIn fact, it is not easy to define the exact amount of Mr. Lemire\u2019s investment, because, as he himself has accepted, his personal assets and those of Gala Radio have been somewhat commingled322. The Tribunal is satisfied that the total proven amount of investment made by Mr. Lemire since 1995 is in the region of between 2 and 3 M USD: 1.3 M USD real estate323, 0.8 M USD assets324, 0.3 M USD loans325 (the marketing expenses seem to have been funded by Gala Radio, and as such do not qualify as investment326). To this must be added his own management time during 15 years, which undoubtedly represents a significant economic value, at any rate well in excess of the modest salary he was attributed by Gala Radio; as well as the hypothetical additional amounts which Mr. Lemire would have invested if he had been granted the additional licences which were denied to him327.\n\nCMRI, para. 20.\n\nCMRI, para. 13.\n\nCMRI, para. 17.\n\nCMRI, para. 20.\n\nRMRI, para. 113.\n\nIn para. 370 of his Separate opinion, Dr. Voss argues that if the investment made by Mr. Lemire since 1995 is - as the Tribunal finds - in the region of between 2 and 3 M USD, and this determination is related to Gala\u2019s actual net enterprise value of some 126,290 USD assumed by the Tribunal, then Gala must have generated a net loss of some 2 M USD between 1995 and 2010. Dr. Voss\u2019 argument is difficult to follow. First of all, Dr. Voss is comparing an accounting item (investments) with an enterprise value calculated under a DCF analysis - apples with oranges. But that is not all: applying basic accounting and financial logic, it is not tme that (i) amounts invested minus (ii) DCF enterprise value equates to (iii) losses.\n\nRisk Environment\n----------------\n\n303.\n\n(ii) Another important factor which must be taken into account is the risk environment in which Mr. Lemire made his investment. Mr. Lemire was not a passive investor in a mature market. He had the courage to venture into a transitional State and to create from scratch a completely new business. Transitional economies need such investors, who take considerable risks and commit themselves with great energy, notwithstanding the absence of clear recovery horizons. Such investors come and go, many of them risking and losing everything because their idea was not sound, or they were too quickly discouraged, or the venture turned out to require greater resources than what they were able to mobilise. When they lose, they have no right to compensation. Legal liability by the host state arises only if the duties of legal investment protection have been breached, and is transformed into monetary recovery only when there has, in consequence, been an appreciable loss.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Mr. Lemire is in this situation; the Tribunal has made an evaluation of the loss suffered, using the DCF methodology submitted by the experts. It has applied this procedure and established a number. Is this amount a fair reflection of the actual loss, reasonably proportional to the investment?\n\n305.\n\nMr. Lemire is not to be equated with a US investor who purchases Treasury bonds, or invests in a residential project in a region known for steady economic growth and increased demand for housing. The risk/reward ratio which Mr. Lemire and such a passive investor can expect are radically different. Two additional factors stand out: Mr. Lemire has devoted a significant proportion of his career to the Gala Radio project in Ukraine, and he brought and implemented a new conception of commercial radio which was entirely new in this ex-USSR environment. Mr. Lemire seemed to have been on his way to becoming a dominant figure in the radio industry in Ukraine. Once he proved that it could be done, others with greater political clout shouldered him aside, and this was clearly facilitated by the conduct of the State.\n\n306.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal finds that there is indeed an adequate proportionality between the compensation awarded to Mr. Lemire and his investment - not in cash alone but in a combination of cash, risk-taking, personal commitment, and the essential contribution of a path-breaker.\n\nComparable Transactions\n-----------------------\n\n307.\n\n(iii) EBS, Respondent\u2019s expert, has made the effort of submitting a valuation of Gala Radio based, not on a DCF analysis, but on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable companies in Ukraine328. As EBS itself acknowledges, the number of transactions is limited, the available information incomplete or not confirmed, and the exercise is not fully reliable.\n\nESR, p. 25.\n\n308.\n\nSubject to these caveats, and assuming that Gala Radio had only been able to secure a 5% market share, EBS calculates that the value of Gala Radio as a national network operating additionally a second AM talk network would amount to approximately 5 M USD. It must be stressed that EBS\u2019 calculation is based on an assumed 5% market share. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this figure is low, because it does not take into consideration that during the late 90\u2019s Gala Radio was the number 1 or number 2 radio station in Kyiv and that it was deprived of its first mover advantage. It seems reasonable to accept that, but for the wrongful breach of the BIT, Gala Radio would have grown into one of the main radio broadcasters in Ukraine, with more than a 5% market share, and consequently with a value well above the 5 M USD proposed by EBS.\n\n309.\n\nIf one accepts EBS\u2019 calculation that a reasonable valuation of Gala Radio in \"but for\" conditions would significantly exceed 5 M USD, and if one remembers that the actual \"as is\" value of the company is very low or almost nil, the figures again confirm the reasonableness of the compensation established by the Tribunal.\n\n**IV.2 The Existence of Moral Damages**\n---------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe First Decision devoted section VII.4.3 to a preliminary analysis of Claimant\u2019s request for a compensation for moral damages, which he claimed in an amount of 3 M USD. The Arbitral Tribunal noted that Gala Radio was not treated in an even-handed fashion by the National Council as its regulator, and identified three sets of facts which, in theory, could lead to the awarding of moral damages:\n\n- the rejection of all (bar one) of Gala Radio\u2019s applications for new frequencies329;\n\n- the fact that Gala Radio was never inspected until 2005, and in the next three years was the object of five inspections, of which four were unscheduled and warnings against Gala Radio followed330;\n\n- Gala Radio\u2019s application for extension of its licence was delayed and was granted in the same session when a substantial increase in the renewal fees was approved331.\n\nFirst Decision, paras. 485 and 486.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 484.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 484.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledged that moral damages could only be awarded in exceptional circumstances332 and postponed the decision on whether the facts of the case constituted *\"exceptional circumstances\"*, until further briefed on the context and causation of the moral damages333.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 476.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 486.\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Case**\n----------------------\n\n312.\n\nMr. Lemire considers that the *\"exceptional circumstances'\"* test is met. He refers to the *Lusitania* Cases as a standard for such exceptional circumstances. In that case, the Commission found that injuries inflicted which *\"result in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or reputation\"* should receive compensation *\"commensurate to the injury\u2019334.*\n\nMore than 50 cases decided by the Mixed Claims Commission (United States and Germany), included in Volume VII of the November 1, 1923 to 1930, Reports of International Arbitral Awards prepared by the UN, *[Lusitania* Cases\"].\n\n313.\n\nClaimant also submits that the intensity and duration of Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT in relation to the allocation of frequencies, as well as of Respondent\u2019s other breaches, have caused Claimant intense moral injuries, tantamount to bodily injury, which merit compensation in the amount of 3 M USD335.\n\nCMRI, para. 93.\n\nAllegations regarding BIT Breaches Related to the Awarding of Frequencies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nAs regards the breaches in the awarding of frequencies, Claimant stresses that these warrant not only an economic compensation, but also the award of moral damages as compensation for the efforts in applying for frequencies. The efforts referred to by Claimant consist in the preparation of numerous applications throughout the last decade, as well as attendance at meetings, the recording of the National Council\u2019s sessions and the necessary follow-up336. Claimant also lists the disrespect suffered by Mr. Lemire and his team during the procedures, where he was refused the floor during tender meetings.\n\nCMRI, para. 81.\n\n315.\n\nAs a result of these practices Mr. Lemire claims to have suffered *\"constant indignity, frustration, stress, shock, affront, humiliation, shame, degradation...\"337.* More specifically, Claimant states that the constant rejections resulting from the BIT breaches incurred by Ukraine eroded his image, turning him from a *\"great pioneer\"* into a *\"loser incapable of expanding his business and playing in a bigger league\"338,* thus depriving him of the first mover advantage and a promising leadership position in the radio industry.\n\nCMRI, para. 81.\n\nCMRI, para. 82.\n\n316.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Lemire claims that the constant portrayal of him as a loser by Respondent continued even after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision acknowledging Ukraine\u2019s breaches.\n\n317.\n\nAsa result of these practices Claimant submits that his other activities (such as the development of his group of companies and business in general or the enjoyment of life) were disrupted.\n\nAllegations regarding other Breaches\n------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nAs regards damage resulting from other breaches, Claimant stresses Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions, which, as the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged, resulted in a one-sided treatment of Gala Radio339, such as for instance the number of inspections suffered, or the warnings issued by the National Council against Gala Radio, warnings which later on were set aside by the Ukrainian courts.\n\nCMRI, by reference to the First Decision, paras. 484 and 485.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Case**\n------------------------\n\n319.\n\nRespondent considers that moral damages cannot be awarded, since the facts of the case do not rise to the standard set by international investment tribunals. Ukraine compares the circumstances of these proceedings to those found in *Desert Line Projects v. Yemen340* and draws the conclusion that the standard of *\"exceptional circumstances\"* refers to cases where the government exerts malicious physical duress and displays *\"egregious behaviour\"341.*\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17), Award of February 6, 2008 *[\"Desert Line\"].*\n\nRMRI, para. 406.\n\n320.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the *\"great effort\"* which Claimant allegedly had to deploy is not sufficient to meet the standard necessary to award moral damages, since the sufferings Mr. Lemire says he endured are not comparable to military siege or physical arrest. Ukraine further states that Gala Radio\u2019s situation was no different than that of other national broadcasters, which were subject to the same monitoring and inspection procedures and were treated in a similar way in the renewal of their licences342.\n\nRMRI, paras. 409 *et seq.*\n\n321.\n\nRespondent also makes reference to the decision in *Siag343,* where the claim for moral damages was rejected under the basis that the *\"exceptional circumstances\"* threshold is very high and applies only to extreme cases of harassment. Ukraine maintains that there is no evidence that Claimant was maliciously treated or that he or his company suffered any physical harm or direct threats. In fact, Respondent considers that it was the National Council who was harassed and intimidated by Mr. Lemire344.\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15), Award of June 1, 2009 *[Siag\"].*\n\nRMRI, para. 415.\n\n322.\n\nUkraine also rejects Claimant\u2019s representation that he has become *\"a beggar merely trying to survive\"345.* Respondent considers that Gala Radio has shown a certain level of success, which places the company in a respectable position within the Ukrainian broadcasting market, as proven *i.e.* by the awards received for its performance.\n\nRMRI, para. 416, by reference to CMRI, para. 82.\n\n323.\n\nIn any case, Respondent considers that Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the award of moral damages is necessary to place Mr. Lemire in the position he would have been in had there been no breaches of the BIT346.\n\nStandard set by the *Factory at Chorzdw* case, according to Respondent.\n\n324.\n\nIf the Arbitral Tribunal were to determine that Claimant is entitled to moral damages, Respondent considers that the amount requested by Claimant is disproportionate and unsupported, since he has provided no basis for his quantification347. Furthermore, Respondent points out that the amounts awarded for moral damages before international human rights courts and tribunals are much lower than that requested by Claimant.\n\nRMRI, para.418.\n\n**3. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n---------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first (3.1) elaborate on the standards for the awarding of moral damages and then (3.2) apply these standards to three distinct sets of facts: (A) breaches in the awarding of frequencies; (B) inspections and (C) renewal of licences, and (3.3) finally will state its conclusions.\n\n**3.1. The Standards for Moral Damages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has acknowledged in the First Decision that moral damages may be awarded, but only under exceptional circumstances. No precise definition exists on what constitutes *\"exceptional circumstances'\".* The definition must be induced from existing case law. Both parties have submitted case law on this issue:\n\n*The Desert Line Case*\n----------------------\n\n327.\n\nThis case348 is a prominent example in the award of moral damages.\n\nClaimant was a construction company which was engaged by the Republic of Yemen to build asphalt roads. In early 2004, after completing all constructions works, claimant requested payment of amounts due. The parties commenced an arbitration, which ended in an award favourable to claimant\u2019s interests. Claimant then complained about some clerical and calculation mistakes in the award. An altercation followed between claimant\u2019s personnel and the Yemeni army, which resulted in a four-day arrest of three of claimant\u2019s personnel. Later that same year respondent applied for the annulment of the award and the parties exchanged proposals for a settlement agreement, which was signed at the end of the year. Claimant challenged the validity of the settlement agreement and thereafter commenced an ICSID arbitration.\n\n*Desert Line**,* see footnote 340 *supra.*\n\n328.\n\nThe award acknowledged that claimant was subject to what it describes as a siege with heavy artillery, an armed assault, an act of terror in its worst image349, that claimant suffered threats and attacks on the physical integrity of its investment350 and that the settlement agreement was imposed onto claimant under physical and financial duress351. The award described the cause of the moral damages as the *\"stress and anxiety of being harassed, threatened and detained\"* and *\"intimidated\u2019* and the *\"significant injury to* [claimant\u2019s] *credit and reputation and* [claimant\u2019s] los[s] [of its] *prestige\"352.* The award further characterises the prejudice suffered by claimant as \" *substantial\"*, since it affected the physical health of claimant\u2019s executives and claimant\u2019s credit and reputation353. The Tribunal finally awarded 1 M USD for moral damages, including loss of reputation.\n\n*Desert Line,* para. 166.\n\n*Desert Line,* para. 185.\n\n*Desert Line,* para. 186.\n\n*Desert Line,* para. 286.\n\n*Desert Line,* para. 290.\n\n*The Lusitania Cases*\n---------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe *Lusitania* Cases are some of the earliest international decisions dealing with the concept of moral damages.\n\nThe decisions go back as far as to World War I and grew out of the sinking of the British ocean liner Lusitania, which was torpedoed by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland on May 7, 1915, during the period of American neutrality. Of the 197 American citizens aboard the Lusitania at that time, 69 were saved and 128 lost.\n\n330.\n\nThe Umpire354 acknowledged the mental suffering or shock caused by the violent severing of family ties by reason of the deaths355. The decision further elaborated on the concept of damages, finding that *\"one injured is... entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation\"356;* excluding, however, exemplary (punitive, vindictive) damages357.\n\nOf the Mixed Claims Commission United States-Germany in accordance with the Agreement of August 10, 1922, extended by Agreement of December 31, 1928, within the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Germany, signed at Berlin, August 25, 1927.\n\n*Lusitania* Cases, p. 35.\n\n*Lusitania* Cases, p. 40.\n\n*Lusitania* Cases, p. 33.\n\n*The Siag Case*\n---------------\n\n331.\n\nRespondent has presented this case to support its allegations that no moral damages shall be awarded.\n\nClaimants, Mr. Siag and his late mother Mrs. Vecchi, filed a claim against the Republic of Egypt for alleged expropriation of a property on which claimants planned to implement a luxury resort. Egypt seized claimants\u2019 property with five separate decrees and took physical control of the property on two occasions. Each seizure was in time revoked by Court decisions; Egypt, however, disregarded such decisions and new seizures followed. The seizures were carried out by force, which included the beating of one of Mr. Siag\u2019s employees, who required hospital care, and led to the arrest of Mr. Siag and three of his lawyers.\n\n332.\n\nClaimants did not seek an award on punitive damages, but submitted that Egypt\u2019s conduct entitled claimants to enhanced damages and so urged the Tribunal to impose a measure of damages which would afford full reparation by indulging all reasonable inference in favour of Claimants358. In a *dictum* the tribunal made a clear distinction between two issues: one is the question whether punitive damages are available; another is whether recovery for an unlawful expropriation should proceed on a more generous basis than that for a lawful expropriation. On the first question, the award stated that punitive damages were, by their very nature, not compensatory and that the prevailing view of tribunals is that, in international law, they are generally not available except in extreme cases of egregious behaviour359. On the second question, the tribunal was not prepared to draw any inferences other than those justified by evidence360.\n\n*Siag,* para. 505.\n\n*Siag,* para. 545.\n\n*Siag,* para. 547.\n\n333.\n\nThe conclusion which can be drawn from the above case law is that, as a general rule, moral damages are not available to a party injured by the wrongful acts of a State, but that moral damages can be awarded in exceptional cases, provided that\n\n- the State\u2019s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;\n\n- the State\u2019s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and\n\n- both cause and effect are grave or substantial.\n\n**3.2. Application of the Standards to the Facts**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent should compensate him for the moral damages allegedly caused by the irregular awarding of frequencies, the excessive inspections and the attempt to charge abusive renewal fees. The Arbitral Tribunal will apply the required standards, defined in the preceding section, to the three sets of acts identified by Respondent:\n\n**A. Breaches in the Awarding of Frequencies**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nClaimant argues that he suffered two kinds of injuries provoked by the National Council\u2019s procedures for awarding radio licences: (i) the disproportionate and excessive efforts which Claimant had to incur in the preparation of applications and (ii) the disrespect and humiliation caused by the constant rejections.\n\n336.\n\n(i) The Arbitral Tribunal finds that excessive or disproportionate efforts which an applicant may have incurred when requesting administrative licences, by their nature, are most unlikely to give rise to moral damages, since the injury does not meet any of the three standards required for the existence of moral damages.\n\n337.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal acknowledges that Claimant has devoted a significant effort to preparing and submitting more than 200 applications to the National Council and that he may have been despondent, when all applications bar one were rejected. But the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that Claimant suffered extraordinary stress or anxiety - especially since Mr. Lemire is an experienced professional and a seasoned entrepreneur. And the economic compensation which the Tribunal has already awarded constitutes sufficient redress for incidental difficulties which Mr. Lemire may have endured.\n\n338.\n\n(ii) Claimant has also submitted that recurring rejections of applications had a negative impact on his entrepreneurial image. The Tribunal accepts that the second requirement for the existence of moral damages - a requirement which *inter alia* includes loss of reputation - is probably met. However, this is not enough: the main question is to determine whether the injury inflicted is substantial.\n\n339.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has pondered the circumstances of the case and decides that the gravity required under the standard is not present. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts that Mr. Lemire was first invited into Ukraine as a leading investor in the nascent radio industry and then suffered an unlawful treatment by the Ukrainian media regulator. The Tribunal sympathizes with Mr. Lemire\u2019s predicament, but feels that the injury suffered cannot be compared to that caused by armed threats, by the witnessing of deaths or by other similar situations in which Tribunals in the past have awarded moral damages. And the acknowledgement in the First Decision that Ukraine has indeed breached the BIT, and the present award of substantial compensation, are elements of redress which may significantly repair Mr. Lemire\u2019s loss of reputation.\n\n**B. Inspections**\n------------------\n\n340.\n\nIn its First Decision the Tribunal established that Gala Radio was in a short time period inspected five times by the National Council, that four of these procedures were unscheduled, and that two cases finalized with the National Council issuing warnings against the radio broadcaster, which were eventually set aside by the Ukrainian Courts.\n\n341.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal accepts that inspections by a regulator, if improperly used as tools of intimidation against regulated entities, constitute egregious behaviour and an abuse of power, which can cause extreme stress and anxiety to the supervised and result in an entitlement to be compensated for the moral damage inflicted. But this is not the case at hand. Claimant has not alleged, and the Tribunal has not found any indication, that the National Council tried to intimidate Gala Radio through its inspections. Additionally, the two warnings issued by the National Council were annulled by Court decisions. There is no evidence that Ukraine had orchestrated a cat-and-mouse game of some kind. It thus appears that Claimant\u2019s situation prior to the inspections has already been reestablished and, thus, no lasting prejudice was caused.\n\n**C. Renewal of Licence**\n-------------------------\n\n342.\n\nThe National Council initially decided that Gala Radio\u2019s renewal of licence should be charged at the new increased fee rate, but the National Council finally reassessed its decision, and accepted to significantly reduce the amount, applying the previous formula361.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 473.\n\n343.\n\nThis situation is similar to that of the inspections analysed in the preceding section. The National Council\u2019s initial decision was incorrect, Claimant may have suffered some degree of stress or anxiety until the mistake was corrected, but in the end Mr. Lemire\u2019s arguments were accepted and he has paid the renewal fee at the correct lower rates. There is no warrant for Claimant to be awarded additional moral damages.\n\n**3.3. Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n344.\n\nSumming up, although the Tribunal acknowledges that Mr. Lemire was mistreated by his regulator, the National Council, and has sympathy and understanding for the stress and anxiety which he must have felt at certain times during his long fight in the defence of his rights, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the moral aspects of his injuries have already been compensated by the awarding of a significant amount of economic compensation, and that the extraordinary tests required for the recognition of separate and additional moral damages have not been met in this case.\n\n345.\n\nAdditionally, it must be remembered that Mr. Lemire may not have been consistently adroit: his continuous appeals to the Courts to obtain redress and to the American Embassy to secure protection, his repeated letter writing to a wide array of authorities, and the video recording of the sessions of the National Council, may have appeared rude and disrespectful to the Ukrainian authorities362. Finally, another important aspect to bear in mind is that the Ukrainian legal system has, to some extent, afforded Claimant an effective means for appealing the regulator\u2019s decisions. In the case of the renewal fees, the Ministry of Justice has sided with Claimant against the National Council363. These elements reinforce the conclusion that a separate redress for moral damages is not appropriate.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 482.\n\nFirst Decision, para. 483.\n\n**IV.3. Interest**\n------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Case**\n----------------------\n\n346.\n\nClaimant had initially requested that Respondent be ordered to pay interest at a rate of LIBOR +3364 compounded semi-annually on the amounts to be paid by Respondent as of the date they were determined to have been due to Claimant. However, he later decided to reduce the interest rate claimed in his Reply Memorial and PHB to a rate of LIBOR +2365 compounded semi-annually *\"to keep in line with the practice of ICSID Arbitral Tribunals\"366.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s PHB, para. 151.\n\nCMRI, para. 99.\n\nCMRI, footnote 126.\n\n347.\n\nTo support his assessment of the practice of arbitral tribunals, Claimant makes reference to the awards in the cases *PSEG Global, Inc. et al. v. Republic of Turkey367, Sempra Energy International v. The Argentine Republic368* and *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Kazakhstan369.*\n\n*PSEG Global Inc. Et al. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award of January 19, 2007, [\"PSEG\"], para. 90.\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Award of September 28, 2007, *[\"Sempra\"],* para. 137.\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v., Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16), Award of July 29, 2008, *[\"Rumeli\"],* para. 227.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Case**\n------------------------\n\n348.\n\nRespondent considers that if compensation should be awarded to Claimant, he should only be entitled to simple interest at the LIBOR rate370, as decided in the *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTH Chile S.A v. Republic of Chile371.*\n\nRMRI, para. 449.\n\nRespondent has referred in RMRI footnote 594 to *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTH Chile S.A v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Award of May 25, 2004, [\"MTD\"], para. 280. However, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the correct ICSID Case No. for those parties is ARB/01/7 and that there is no paragraph 280; the issue of interest is addressed in para. 251.\n\n349.\n\nRespondent submits that tribunals in recent investment treaty cases have concluded that simple interest suffices for claimants to be fully compensated. It does not consider that there are any particular circumstances in this case justifying the award of compound interest372. It refers to the award in the case CMS'373, where the Tribunal decided that the interest rate should be simple rather than compounded semi-annually.\n\nRMRI, para. 448.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005, [\"CMS\"], para. 471.\n\n350.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent points out that no justification was given by Claimant to uphold his request for the application of a rate of LIBOR +2 compounded semiannually374.\n\nRMRI, para. 448.\n\n**3. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n---------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nClaimant has requested that, if compensation is awarded, interest should accrue with LIBOR as the rate of reference. Respondent, although it has denied Claimant\u2019s right to be compensated, has accepted that if the Tribunal were to award compensation, interest should be calculated by reference to LIBOR. The Tribunal agrees.\n\n352.\n\nLIBOR represents the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market and is fixed daily by the British Bankers\u2019 Association for different maturities and for different currencies. LIBOR is universally accepted as a valid reference for the calculation of variable interest rates. In the present case, an additional reason for the selection of LIBOR is that it is consistent with Article III.l of the BIT, which provides that compensation for expropriation shall include *\"interest at a commercially reasonable rate, such as LIBOR plus an appropriate margin\"*. Although the rule refers to expropriation, it can be extended without difficulty to compensation for violations of other provisions of the BIT.\n\n353.\n\nSince the compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference for the calculation of interest should be the LIBOR rates for six month deposits denominated in USD, calculated as of the date of delivery of this Award. The rate shall be adjusted every six months thereafter, to reflect changing market conditions.\n\n354.\n\nAlthough the parties have agreed on the generic use of LIBOR as a reference rate, they disagree on two issues: (i) whether the LIBOR rate should be increased by a margin of 2% as Claimant suggests; and (ii) whether the interest rate should be simple or compounded semi-annually.\n\n(i) Margin\n----------\n\n355.\n\nAs regards the addition of a margin to the LIBOR reference rate, the Tribunal sides with Claimant. LIBOR reflects the interest at which banks lend to each other money. Loans to customers invariably include a surcharge, and this surcharge must be inserted in the calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Claimant by the temporary withholding of money. A claimant to whom money is awarded would not be fully compensated, if the interest rate applied did not include an appropriate margin. This is acknowledged by Article III.l of the BIT, which expressly provides that the LIBOR rate should be increased by *\"an appropriate margin\".*\n\n356.\n\nClaimant has proposed a margin of 2%. The Tribunal concurs: 2% is a reasonable margin, which reflects the surcharge which an average borrower would have to pay for obtaining financing based on LIBOR375.\n\nLIBOR plus a 2% margin was applied in a number of recent investment arbitration decisions: *PSEG,* para. 90; *Sempra,* para. 137; *and Rumeli,* para. 227.\n\n(ii) Simple or semi-annually compounded interest\n------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nClaimant has requested that the interest should be compounded semi-annually, while Respondent proposes that simple interest be applied. It is important to clarify what Claimant is requesting: he is not asking that interest be continuously capitalised and itself bear interest, in accordance with the compound interest formula. Such a request is incompatible with LIBOR, which is always calculated applying the simple interest methodology.\n\n358.\n\nWhat Claimant requests, and the question to be decided by the Tribunal, is whether the unpaid LIBOR interest, calculated as simple interest and accruing at the end of each six month period, should be added to the principal, and as such accrue interest in the succeeding interest periods. Claimant submits that this should be done, Respondent that it is inappropriate.\n\n359.\n\nThe question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal has been the subject of diverging decisions376. While older case law tended to repudiate this possibility, recent case law tends to accept annual or semi-annual capitalisation of unpaid interest377.\n\nRespondent has drawn the attention of this Tribunal to cases *MTD,* para. 251 (which is incorrectly quoted) and *CMS,* paras. 470 to 471. However, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that in the former, the interest awarded was compounded; and in the latter, simple interest was only awarded for a period of 60 days after the date of the decision or the date of effective payment, if before; thereafter the interest would be compounded semi-annually.\n\n*MTD,* para. 251; *PSEG,* para. 348; *LG& E,* para. 106; see also Marboe, para. 6,233.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal sides with the more modern decisions. Loan agreements in which interest is calculated on the basis of LIBOR plus a margin usually include a provision that unpaid interest must be capitalised at the end of the interest period, and will thereafter be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason for this provision is that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market, in order to fund the amounts due but defaulted, and the lender\u2019s additional funding costs have to be covered by the defaulting borrower.\n\n361.\n\nThis principle implies in our case that, if Claimant were to take out a LIBOR loan to anticipate the amounts to which he is entitled under the Award, the bank would insist that unpaid interest be capitalised at the end of each interest period. Consequently, if Claimant is to be kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered, interest owed under the Award should be capitalised at the end of each six month interest period. The Tribunal, thus, decides that due and unpaid interest shall be capitalized semi-annually, from the *dies a quo.*\n\n(iii) *Dies a quo* and *dies ad quem*\n-------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThere is one final issue to be decided: when interest should start accruing, and when it should stop. Claimant has left the determination of the *dies a quo* rather vague, referring to the date on which the compensation is determined to have been due to Claimant.\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that the appropriate *dies a quo* is the date of delivery of this Award. This is the date when the actual amount of damages is established, the date when Respondent\u2019s obligation to pay the compensation arises and, consequently, the appropriate date for interest to start accruing. Notwithstanding the above, the Tribunal acknowledges that Respondent, being a State, requires a certain period of time to perform the legal formalities required for the payment of a sum of money. Therefore, Respondent shall have a 60 day grace period from the date of delivery of this Award to pay the amounts owed, without interest. If after such period of time any amounts remain pending, interest shall accrue on such amounts as from the date of delivery of the Award378.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal in *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Award of November 13, 2000, para. 97, granted the same grace period: *\"The Kingdom of Spain shall make such payment within a period of 60 days as of the date of this Award. Should the payment of this amount not be made within the period specified above, the amount shall accrue interests at a rate of 6% per annum compounded monthly as of the date of the Award to the date ofpayment\".*\n\n364.\n\nInterest shall continue to accrue, until all amounts owed in accordance with this Award have been finally paid.\n\n**IV.4. Costs**\n---------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Request**\n-------------------------\n\n365.\n\nClaimant\u2019s total arbitration costs are quantified at 1,764,348 USD, all of which have been paid, and are broken down as follows379:\n\n- ICSID and the Tribunal USD 424,921\n\nClaimant\u2019s final statement of costs of August 6, 2010.\n\n366.\n\nClaimant submits that his costs are reasonable and, since all jurisdictional issues and principal claim were won, it is only fair that all costs be awarded380. If, against Claimant\u2019s expectations, the Tribunal were to award only partial costs, the Tribunal should bear in mind that the requested amount already represents only a part of the total costs which Mr. Lemire will incur. Claimant\u2019s counsel is working in consideration of a success fee, which has not been included in the above calculation, because it has not yet been invoiced381.\n\nHTRI, p. 4.\n\nHTRI, p. 4.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Request**\n---------------------------\n\n367.\n\nRespondent quantified its fees, costs and expenses as follows382:\n\n- Fees and Disbursements of international counsel USD 3,042,206  \n- Fees and Disbursements of Ukrainian counsel USD 1,330,338  \n- Fees and Disbursements of EBS USD 55,270  \n- Advance on Costs for the Arbitration USD 400,000\n\nRespondent\u2019s final statement of costs of August 9, 2010.\n\n368.\n\nThe total amounts to 4,827,814 USD, of which 1,549,180 USD have been paid. Respondent requires that it be awarded all or, substantially all, of its costs383.\n\nRMRI, para. 442.\n\n369.\n\nRespondent advances three reasons: (2.1) Claimant asserted but then conceded four significant claims; (2.2) the Tribunal\u2019s First Decision dismissing the majority of Claimant\u2019s claims; and (2.3) Claimant\u2019s general conduct throughout the arbitration.\n\n**2.1. The Abandonment of Claims**\n----------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nClaimant has abandoned some of his initial claims, namely those related to the Beauty Salon in Kyiv, to Kiss and Energy trademarks, to the \"affiliation agreements\" and to the \"continuous interference\" on the FM 100 frequency in Kyiv.\n\n371.\n\nRespondent spent a significant amount of time and resources in order to address these claims which were later abandoned by Claimant384. Some of the claims were discussed in witness statements, in the Counter-Memorial, the Rejoinder and the PHB385, and other compelled investigations of the facts386.\n\nRMRI, para. 426.\n\nSuch as the trademarks, affiliation agreement and \"continuous interference\" issues.\n\nSuch as the beauty salon issues.\n\n**2.2. The Dismissal of Claims**\n--------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nRespondent requests that Claimant should bear most, if not all387, of these costs under the principle of *\"loser pays\"388.* The Arbitral Tribunal dismissed all of Claimant\u2019s claims related to the Settlement Agreement389, the claims related to the tender of November 20, 2002 and of October 19, 2005, those related to the local music requirement of the Ukrainian Law on Broadcasting and those related to the alleged breach of the Clause contained in Article II.3 (c) of the US-Ukraine BIT which permits a breach of contract to be characterised as a breach of the BIT (the Umbrella Clause)390.\n\nRMRI, para. 423.\n\nRMRI, para. 423.\n\nRMRI, para. 431.\n\nRMRI, para. 434.\n\n**2.3. The Misconduct**\n-----------------------\n\n373.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s conduct throughout this case has significantly and unnecessarily increased the cost of Ukraine\u2019s defence391. Claimant also attempted to reverse the burden of proof in relation to Gala Radio\u2019s unsuccessful applications for frequencies in various tenders392. In addition, Claimant took a combative attitude during the arbitration on the issue of document production and substantiating his claims393.\n\nRMRI, para. 423.\n\nRMRI, para. 438.\n\nRMRI, para. 441.\n\n374.\n\nRespondent finally raises an argument to dismiss Claimant\u2019s request for costs, based on the lack of causation. Taking such lack of causation into consideration, and when the minimal economic effect of awarding even a significant number of additional frequencies to Gala Radio is factored, it becomes apparent that Claimant has, at best, mounted an expensive and over-inflated claim, for which the defence costs are more than the amount at issue. Thus, the breaches of the BIT found in the First Decision do not represent a \"win\" in favour of Claimant394.\n\nRMRI, para. 437.\n\n**3. Claimant\u2019s Reply**\n-----------------------\n\n375.\n\nClaimant characterises Ukraine\u2019s approach on costs as novel. Despite having lost its jurisdictional and liability claims, it does not shy away from claiming costs and also complaining about costs395.\n\nHTRI, p. 3.\n\n376.\n\nIf this arbitration procedure has been costly, it is not only attributable to the complexity of the issues in dispute, but also to the fact that Ukraine engaged in a number of unnecessary and costly measures. First, it unsuccessfully challenged one of the arbitrators. Second, it has delayed the renewal of Claimant\u2019s licence, then tried to charge an exorbitant renewal licence fee that led to a request for interim measures. Third, it advanced new arguments and factual contentions, and submitted voluminous new documentation, at untimely stages of the process396.\n\nHTRI, p. 3.\n\n**4. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n---------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*\"... the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid\".*\n\n378.\n\nArticle VII.4 of the BIT states as follows:\n\n*\"Expenses incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the proceedings shall be paid for equally by the Parties. The Tribunal may, however, at its discretion, direct that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Parties\".*\n\n379.\n\nIn accordance with these rules, there being no specific agreement among the parties as regards legal expenses, the BIT provides as a general principle that costs shall be paid equally, but it grants the Tribunal full discretion to assess the fees and costs of the arbitration and the legal expenses incurred by the parties and to decide how and by whom these fees, costs and expenses are to be borne397.\n\nSee also Rule 47(1) (j) ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n380.\n\nThe traditional position in investment arbitration is to split the arbitration costs equally among the parties398. The Arbitral Tribunal, however, welcomes the newly established and growing trend, that there should be an allocation of costs that reflects in some measure the principle that the losing party should contribute in a significant, if not necessarily exhaustive, fashion to the fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration of the prevailing party399.\n\nCristoph H. Schreuer \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\", Second Edition, 2009, p. 1232.\n\n*EDF,* para. 327; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24) Award of August 27, 2008, para. 316; *Phoenix Action, LTD. v. The Czech Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/05), Award of April 15, 2009, para. 151.\n\n381.\n\nThe final result of this procedure is that the Tribunal (i) has found that Respondent breached the BIT in most (but not all) of the situations alleged by Claimant, (ii) has awarded compensatory damages in an amount of 8,717,850 USD, (but significantly below the amount claimed), and (iii) finally has rejected all claims for moral damages. Claimant is the overall winning party, without having completely prevailed in a single issue, and after having abandoned a number of claims initially submitted. Claimant therefore should only be entitled to a partial reimbursement of his global arbitration costs.\n\n382.\n\nRespondent also filed on August 29, 2008, a proposal for the disqualification of one arbitrator. On September 23, 2008, the other members of the Tribunal dismissed the proposal. Since this proposal for disqualification was rejected, the Tribunal finds that the full costs and expenses incurred by this incident are attributable to Respondent.\n\n383.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, the Arbitral Tribunal hereby orders Respondent to reimburse Claimant a proportion of the reasonable costs and expenses of pursuing this arbitration in an amount equivalent to 750,000 USD. This amount, if unpaid within 60 days from the delivery of this Award, shall accrue interest in accordance with Section III.3400.\n\nIn para. 413 of his Separate Opinion, Dr. Voss applies para. 92(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, and comes to the conclusion that in this case Respondent is entitled to reimbursement from Claimant in an amount of approximately 4 M USD. Para. 92(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure has not been pleaded by any of the parties. Even if it had been pleaded, the Tribunal fails to understand how this domestic German rule could have any bearing on the allocation of costs and expenses in international investment arbitration under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.\n\n384.\n\nThe Secretariat is to provide the parties a detailed breakdown of the fees paid to the arbitrators and of the costs incurred. Any excess amounts shall be reimbursed equally to the parties.\n\n**V.** Decision\n---------------\n\nOn the basis of the reasons given both in its First Decision and in the present Award, the Tribunal, by majority decision, hereby:\n\n1. Orders Respondent to pay to Claimant 8,717,850 USD as compensation for Respondent\u2019s violation of the FET standard defined in the BIT, within 60 days from the delivery of this Award;\n\n2. Orders Respondent to pay to Claimant 750,000 USD as compensation for the costs and expenses incurred in this arbitration, within 60 days from the delivery of this Award;\n\n3. Orders Respondent to pay to Claimant interest on the amounts established in the two preceding paragraphs, if such amounts have not been paid within 60 days from the delivery of this Award; interest shall (i) accrue as from the date of delivery of this Award until full payments of any amounts owed, (ii) be calculated at the LIBOR rate for six month deposits denominated in USD, on the date of delivery of this Award, and adjusted every six months thereafter, plus a margin of 2% and (iii) be capitalised every six months from the date of delivery of this Award;\n\n4. Dismisses all other claims.\n\nDr. Voss dissents from this Award and, as authorized by Rule 47(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, attaches his individual opinion. In accordance with Rule 47(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Award is signed by the members of the Tribunal who voted for it."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2013-07-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Annulment Proceeding Concurring Opinion Eduardo Zuleta", "Type": "Concurring Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Annulment Proceeding Concurring Opinion Eduardo Zuleta\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI respectfully submit that:\n\n1.\n\nI concur with the decision of my distinguished colleagues of the Committee that:\n\n(a) The Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability cannot be object of this annulment proceeding.\n\n(b) Respondent\u2019s claims regarding the annulment of the Award on the basis of a manifest excess of powers, departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and failure to state the reasons, must be rejected.\n\n(c) In accordance with the terms of Procedural Order No. 3, the Committee orders the immediate lift of the stay and the immediate payment owed to Claimant, per the terms of section 5.1(a) of the Escrow Agreement entered between the Parties.\n\n(d) Each of the Parties should bear its own legal fees, expenses and its own share of the ICSID fees including other expenses.\n\n2.\n\nHowever, I am not persuaded by the analysis resulting in the application of Arbitration Rule 27 to the allegations by Respondent that (a) the Award did not consider the implications of the Settlement Agreement; (b) the Award disregarded the res judicata effect of the Lemire I Award; and (c) the Majority failed to state reasons in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability with respect to clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n3.\n\nBased on the allegations of Respondent and on a strict interpretation of Arbitration Rule 27, the waiver provided for therein should have been applied only to the grounds for annulment invoked by Respondent as arising from (a) the submission in the post hearing memorials of a claim Respondent did not have the opportunity to dispute; and (b) the refusal to hear the testimony of Mr. Kurus, refer to events where rules of procedure may have been violated.\n\n4.\n\nI consider, thus, that the allegations by Respondent mentioned under 2 above should have not been rejected based on Arbitration Rule 27, but that an analysis on the merits of each one was required.\n\n5.\n\nI must note, however, that such analysis on the merits would have likely led to the conclusion that the claims related to the Settlement Agreement and the Lemire award had no merit, and therefore the final decision, not to annul the Award, would have been the same."}], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n36.\n\nOn July 26, 2011, pursuant to Article 52 of the **ICSID Convention** and Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"****),** Ukraine filed an application requesting partial annulment of both27 the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award rendered in the arbitration proceeding between Mr. Lemire and Ukraine - (jointly the **\"Parties\").** The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Application and forwarded it to Claimant on July 26, 2011.\n\nRespondent seeks partial annulment of both, the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award. However, Respondent does not distinguish between both tenns; instead. Respondent refers to both decisions as \"Award\", even when addressing the content of one of them. In aim of practicality and clarity, this Committee distinguishes and addresses them individually: \"Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\" on the one hand, and \"Award\" on the other hand.\n\n37.\n\nIn its Application, Respondent sought partial annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and of the Award on the following grounds as set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\na. the Majority manifestly exceeded its powers, Article 52(1)(b);\n\nb. the Majority seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, Article 52(1)(d); and\n\nc. the Majority failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based, Article 52(1)(e).\n\n38.\n\nUnder Article 52(5) of the Washington Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules, Ukraine\u2019s Application contained a request for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the issuance of the annulment decision.\n\n39.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on July 27, 2011, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules, enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter of October 7, 2011, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified by the Secretary-General of ICSID that an *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted (composed of Dr. Claus von Wobeser as President, Professor Azzedine Kettani and Dr. Eduardo Zuleta) and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Eloise Obadia, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee in the temporal absence of Ms. Ai'ssatou Diop, Legal Counsel. From January 10 to September 28, 2012, Ms. Diop again served as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n41.\n\nPursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2) and by letter of the Secretary of the Committee dated October 12, 2011, the Parties were informed of the Committee\u2019s decision on the continuation of the stay, while a final decision was reached.\n\n42.\n\nThe Parties timely filed the following submissions on the issue of the stay of enforcement of the Award:\n\n- October 14, 2011: Respondent\u2019s Request for a stay of enforcement of the Award; October 21, 2011: Claimant\u2019s Response on Ukraine\u2019s Request for a stay of enforcement of the Award;\n\n- November 4, 2011: Respondent\u2019s Reply on the stay of enforcement of the Award; and\n\n- November 18, 2011: Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder to Respondent\u2019s Reply on the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n43.\n\nFollowing different communications between the Parties and the Committee regarding the logistics of the First Session, by letter of October 18, 2011, the Committee proposed to the Parties to hold the First Session in Paris on November 25, 2011. Thereafter, the Parties confirmed their availability and agreed with the Committee\u2019s proposal.\n\n44.\n\nThe First Session was held in Paris, on November 25, 2011. During the session, the Parties expressed their views on the stay of enforcement of the Award and, also, different procedural matters were resolved.\n\n45.\n\nPursuant to the Minutes of the First Session of the Committee and Hearing on the Stay, the Parties agreed on the following schedule of submissions:\n\n- February 3, 2012: Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Annulment;\n\n- April 13, 2012: Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment;\n\n- June 8, 2012: Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment; and August 3, 2012: Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n46.\n\nOn November 28, 2011, Respondent submitted a letter complementing its response to a question formulated by the Committee during the First Session, regarding the legal basis under which Ukrainian courts could deny the recognition and enforcement of ICSID awards. Claimant provided its views on Respondent\u2019s submission by letter dated November 30, 2011.\n\n47.\n\nOn January 12, 2012 the Committee issued its First Procedural Order in connection with the stay of the enforcement.\n\n48.\n\nBy communication of February 2, 2012, Respondent informed the Committee that the Parties had agreed on a modification to the schedule of submissions. Pursuant to their agreement, the new schedule was the following:\n\n- February 7, 2012: Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Annulment;\n\n- April 23, 2012: Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment;\n\n- June 18, 2012: Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment; and August 13, 2012: Claimant's Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n49.\n\nBy communication of February 2, 2012, Claimant confirmed with Respondent\u2019s Counsel his agreement on the amendments to the deadlines. The Committee accepted the proposed schedule described on point 48 of this Decision.\n\n50.\n\nOn February 8, 2012, Ukraine submitted its Memorial on Annulment and accompanying documentation.\n\n51.\n\nThe Committee issued its Decision on Ukraine\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award on February 14, 2012 (the **\"Decision on the Stay\").** The Committee unanimously decided that the stay of enforcement of the Award would continue in effect for the duration of this annulment proceeding and until the date on which a final decision on the annulment was rendered, provided however, that within 45 days of the Decision on the Stay, Ukraine posted an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond for the full amount of the Award rendered against it, inclusive of all interests accrued to the date of issuance of said irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond.28\n\nDecision on the Stay, February 14, 2012, \u00b693.\n\n52.\n\nThe unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond had to be issued by a first-tier reputable international credit institution (outside of Ukraine and with no principal establishment or branch in Ukraine) and had to be immediately payable to or cashable by Claimant upon the issuance of a decision rejecting annulment and in full satisfaction of the Award. If the annulment were to be partially accepted by this Committee, Claimant would be able to collect the sum corresponding to the portion of the Award which is not annulled, without prejudice to the possible continuation of the stay allowed by Rule 54(3) and Rule 55(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter dated March 16, 2012, Claimant requested information regarding the posting of the security. In a communication dated March 19, 2012, Ukraine responded that no information could be provided in response to Claimant\u2019s request.\n\n54.\n\nBy communication dated March 21, 2012, the Parties were informed that the hearing would take place in Paris on September 24 and 25, 2012.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter dated March 26, 2012, four days before the expiration of the deadline for the posting of the security pursuant the Decision on the Stay, Claimant invited Ukraine to comply with its obligations under the ICSID Convention and the Committee\u2019s Decision regarding the posting of security.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter of March 28, 2012, Ukraine manifested that it was not in a position to provide a bond in accordance with the conditions of the Decision on the Stay, within the available time and in light of the relevant legislation. Ukraine explained that the issues presented by the Decision on the Stay involved matters not previously encountered in Ukraine.\n\n57.\n\nOn April 2, 2012, the Committee notified Procedural Order No. 2 to the Parties, confirming the termination of the stay. Moreover, the Committee reserved its right to take into account, for the allocation of costs, Respondent\u2019s conduct in complying with the Decision on the Stay.\n\n58.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment and accompanying documentation.\n\n59.\n\nOn June 18, 2012, Respondent submitted its Reply on Annulment along with accompanying material.\n\n60.\n\nBy letter dated August 7, 2012, Claimant requested a seven day extension, until August 20, 2012, to submit its Rejoinder on Annulment. Respondent subsequently agreed on such request by communication dated August 8, 2012.\n\n61.\n\nIn a communication of August 8, 2012, the Parties were informed about logistical arrangements for the hearing to be held on September 24 and 25, 2012.\n\n62.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Annulment and accompanying documentation.\n\n63.\n\nOn September 24, 2012, a hearing **(\"Hearing on Annulment\")** was held at the World Bank Paris Conference Center located in Paris, France, whereby both Parties presented arguments and submissions, and questions from the Members of the Committee were responded to.\n\n64.\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Claimant filed his statement of costs followed by Respondent\u2019s statement of costs on October 26, 2012.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter dated December 17, 2012, the Parties informed the Committee they were in negotiations to establish an escrow account before the Permanent Court of Arbitration **(\"PCA\")** whereby the funds relating to the Award would be held, pending the Decision on Annulment.\n\n66.\n\nOn December 21, 2012, the Parties provided the Committee with an executed version of the Escrow Agreement. The Parties agreed and jointly requested the approval of the Escrow Agreement and the arrangements set forth therein in the form of an order.\n\n67.\n\nOn December 21, 2012, the Committee notified Procedural Order No. 3 to the Parties, ordering a reinstatement of the stay of enforcement of the Award conditional upon Respondent\u2019s due performance of the terms of the Escrow Agreement.\n\n68.\n\nOn January 8, 2013, the proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Arbitration Rules 53 and 38 (1).\n\n69.\n\nThe Committee Members have deliberated by various means of communication and, in rendering this decision, have taken into consideration the Parties\u2019 entire written and oral arguments and submissions on Ukraine\u2019s Application for annulment of the Award.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS TO RULE ON UKRAINE\u2019S APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Committee is bound to apply the provisions of Section 5 of the Washington Convention and the provisions of Chapter VII of the Arbitration Rules, regulating the annulment proceeding. The Committee considers that the application of these binding provisions may be guided, if justified under the circumstances, by paragraphs 41 to 43 of the Report of the Executive Directors on the Washington Convention.\n\n71.\n\nDecisions of ICSID tribunals are not binding on the Parties or the Committee. Previous decisions by *ad hoc* Committees may have an illustrative value on how different cases, under singular factual circumstances and considerations, were resolved.\n\n**V.

THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS ON THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY IN THE CASE AT HAND**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nBased on the allegations presented by the Parties on this matter, it is clear that both agreed on the fact that under ICSID proceedings there is only one award that is final, binding and that can ultimately be subject to an annulment proceeding.180 However, the Parties disagree on whether the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability could have been amended by the Tribunal, upon request of Respondent.181\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 196:22.\n\nWhile Respondent argues that a preliminary decision has res judicata effect and that an award incorporates all previous decisions rendered by the tribunal so they can be ultimately subject of an annulment proceeding, Claimant argues that a preliminary decision stands as an independent decision, and of itself, that could be revisited and revised by request of any of the Parties.\n\n**A. Definition of Award under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nPursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention an annulment proceeding is exclusively for an award. Therefore it is necessary to define the nature of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in order to determine whether it can be subject to this annulment proceeding.\n\n175.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules are silent with respect to a definition of \"award.\" However, the Committee considers that the meaning and scope of such term may be found by interpreting the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules pursuant to the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* *(1969).*\n\n176.\n\nArticle 48 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47 provide a list of elements that an award must necessarily contain. The express terms of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention are as follows:\n\n***Article 48***\n\n*(1) The Tribunal shall decide questions by a majority of the votes of all its members.*\n\n*(2) The award of the Tribunal shall be in writing and shall be signed by the members of the Tribunal who voted for it.*\n\n*(3) The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.*\n\n*(4) Any member of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the award, whether he dissents from the majority or not, or a statement of his dissent.*\n\n*(5) The Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties.*\n\n177.\n\nIn applying the general rule of interpretation set forth in Article 31 of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*182 this Committee finds that the ordinary meaning to be given to Article 48 of the ICSID Convention, in its context and in light of its object and purpose, should be to reserve the term \"award\" for the final decision in writing, voted by the tribunal, whereby it makes a final disposition of the case, on all matters submitted by the parties, stating all the reasons on which it was based. No decision short of that standard should be considered an award under ICSID proceedings.\n\nThis provision states as follows: ***Article 31 - General rule of interpretation:*** **1.** A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. **2.** The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; **(b)** any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty. **3.** There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; **(b)** any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. **4.** A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n178.\n\nArbitration Rule 47 offers further detail on the requirements an award must meet:\n\n***Rule 47 The Award***\n\n*(1) The award shall be in writing and shall contain:*\n\n*(a) a precise designation of each party;*\n\n*(b) a statement that the Tribunal was established under the Convention, and a description of the method of its constitution; Arbitration Rules*\n\n*(c) the name of each member of the Tribunal, and an identification of the appointing authority of each;*\n\n*(d) the names of the agents, counsel and advocates of the parties;*\n\n*(e) the dates and place of the sittings of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(f) a summary of the proceeding;*\n\n*(g) a statement of the facts as found by the Tribunal;*\n\n*(h) the submissions of the parties;*\n\n*(i) the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based; and*\n\n*(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.*\n\n*(2) The award shall be signed by the members of the Tribunal who voted for it; the date of each signature shall be indicated.*\n\n*(3) Any member of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the award, whether he dissents from the majority or not, or a statement of his dissent.*\n\n179.\n\nIn all ICSID Arbitrations, the award must necessarily meet all of the elements set forth in the articles previously referred.\n\n180.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the award on the merits, Arbitration Rules 43 and 41 provide for two possible types of awards:\n\n- Arbitration Rule 43 provides that if the parties reach a settlement of the dispute in the course of a proceeding, the tribunal may embody such settlement in an award.183 According to the provisions of the ICSID Convention, such award would be final, binding, recognized and ultimately enforced by the parties.184\n\n- In addition, Arbitration Rule 41(6) provides that if the tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or its competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, the tribunal should render its decision in an award.185 Such award would be subject to the remedies provided by the ICSID Convention, which include interpretation, rectification and ultimate annulment of the award.186\n\nArbitration Rule 43: (2) If the parties file with the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their settlement and in writing request the Tribunal to embody such settlement in an award, the Tribunal may record the settlement in the form of its award.\n\nNote C to Rule 43 of the 1968 edition of the Arbitration Rules.\n\nArbitration Rule 41: (6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.\n\nNote F to Rule 41 of the 1968 edition of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n181.\n\nAnother reason that supports that under the ICSID system there is only one final Award is that neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules expressly provide for the possibility of issuing partial awards during the course of the proceedings, as other arbitration rules do. For instance ICC Arbitration Rules expressly provide that both \"partial\" and \"definitive\" awards may be issued.187 Likewise, the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) Rules expressly provide for the possibility of issuing interim as well as other awards.188 Furthermore, under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules the tribunal is entitled to make interim, interlocutory or partial awards.189\n\nICC Arbitration Rules, Article 2.\n\nLCIA Rules, Article 26.7\n\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Article 34.1.\n\n182.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules are silent with respect to interim or partial awards, and instead, provide in Article 48 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47 the requirements that a decision must meet in order to be deemed an award.\n\n183.\n\nBased on the above, under the ICSID system, there is only one award that is final and disposes of the case in its entirety. Consequently, in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, a motion for annulment may only proceed against that award.\n\n**B. The Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was Incorporated into the Award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nBased on the fact that there can only be one final award in the ICSID system, the Committee finds that an application for annulment concerning a decision issued prior to the award *(e.g. a decision on a challenge, a provisional measure, or a decision upholding* *jurisdiction, a decision on liability)* cannot be challenged under a motion for annulment, unless and until it is incorporated in the final award.\n\n185.\n\nThe Background paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, prepared by the ICSID Secretariat, dated August 10, 2012, supports such position by stating that a prior decision, rendered during the course of the proceedings, can be subject to an annulment proceeding by virtue of its incorporation into the award:190\n\n*The application for annulment must concern an ICSID award, which is the final decision concluding a case. Since there can be only one award in the ICSID system, the parties must wait until that award is rendered before initiating any post-award remedies.* ***An application for annulment concerning a decision issued prior to the award (e.g. a decision on a challenge, a provisional measure, or a decision upholding jurisdiction) cannot be challenged before it becomes part of the eventual award, even if it raises issues that may constitute the basis for an annulment application.191***\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat prepared this paper to assist Contracting States with a matter raised by the delegation of the Republic of Philippines at the 45th Annual Meeting of the ICSID Administrative Council on September 23, 2011, as promised at that meeting. Specifically, the Republic of Philippines urged the Administrative Council to consider seriously the need to issue guidelines for use by *ad hoc* Committees to ensure fair and effective annulment proceedings. The Secretary-General undertook for the ICSID Secretariat to prepare a background paper on annulment for consideration by the Administrative Council, and, if requested by Contracting States, to facilitate meeting of representatives to look further into this subject. No other Contracting State commented on the presentation of the Philippines or the undertaking of the Secretary-General to prepare this background paper.  \n The ICSID Secretariat took no position on such paper as to whether a specific decision of an ICSID *ad hoc* Committee is correct or is within the proper scope of review allowed by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, (paragraphs 1, 3 and 6 of the Background Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID dated August 10, 2012 Available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDNewsLettersRH&achonVal=ShowDoc ument&DocId=DCEVENTSll. (Last accessed April 1st, 2013)\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, prepared by the ICSID Secretariat, dated August 10, 2012, p. 12, \u00b6 35.\n\n186.\n\nThe act of incorporating a prior decision in the award is essential for it to constitute the basis for an annulment proceeding. Schreuer expressly confirms that any decision, prior to the issuance of the award may not be solely subject to an annulment proceeding:\n\n***Other decisions of the tribunal prior to its award are also not subject to annulment. This applies to procedural orders***  *(See Art. 44, paras. 50-53)*  ***or to decisions on provisional measures under Art. 47.***  *To the extent that such interim measures are reflected in the award, they become subject to annulment.192*\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nChristophe H. Schreuer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 922 \u00b6 64.\n\n187.\n\nAdditionally, in previous ICSID cases, requests for annulment have been refused for proceeding against decisions that did not qualify as an award, nor were incorporated in the final award. For instance, in the case of *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle Past) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt**,* the Respondent filed an application for annulment of the tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction. The Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Respondent of his decision not to register the application for annulment on the ground that the Tribunal\u2019s decision of April 14, 1988 was not an \"award\" under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 50.193\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Case No. ARB/84/3, Award on the Merits, p. 334, \u00b6 26.\n\n188.\n\nThe above cited considerations rule out the possibility of solely challenging a decision, without having it incorporated into the Award.\n\n189.\n\nIn the case at hand, both Parties allege that the Award somehow incorporated the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Specifically, Respondent argues that:\n\n***The awards incorporate, formally speaking the holdings that had been rendered before them in prior decisions, and that\u2019s how a decision gets subjected to review in an annulment context; that\u2019s what happened here.*** *But that does not indicate anything about when the decision itself became binding.194* (Emphasis added)\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 207:2.\n\n190.\n\nClaimant also agrees to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability being incorporated into the Award in the following terms:\n\n*So the Tribunal has the right, as per Article 48 (3), to substantiate its holding in the award. And sometimes you see some decisions on jurisdictions that are just one line,*  ***and then you find in the final award when they go into the merits and incorporate the decision on Jurisdiction, all the grounds for the decision on jurisdiction. It is one way of doing it, and it is possible.***\n\n***[...] What the Tribunal must consider when ruling as to whether there must or not be an annulment is to consider the award with the decision, including all the substantiations given by the award.195***\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nHearing on Annulment, Tr. 113:6.\n\n191.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that both Parties manifest the possibility of having awards that incorporate prior decisions (i.e. a decision on jurisdiction and liability). According to the Parties, the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was incorporated into the Award, so that it can be subject to this annulment proceeding.\n\n192.\n\nThe Committee notes that under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules there is no provision regarding the incorporation of a prior decision in the award so that it can be subject to a motion for annulment. There is no specific test to determine whether a prior decision was ultimately incorporated into the award.\n\n193.\n\nIn addition, there are no previous decisions by **ad hoc** Committees that may have an illustrative value in this regard. Annulment decisions by other **ad hoc** Committees have not addressed nor analyzed this issue specifically. Instead, they \"automatically\" treat prior decisions as part of the award without stating the reasons to support such finding.196\n\n*E.g. CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, *Compagnie* *(^*Exploitation du Chemin de Fer Transgabonais v. Republic of Gabon,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/5*.\n\n194.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Committee considers that the Award incorporated by reference the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Specifically, Section V \"Decision\", page 106 of the Award supports such incorporation: ***\"On the basis of the reasons given*** ***both*** ***in its First Decision and in the present Award, the Tribunal, by majority decision, hereby: [...] \"*** (Emphasis added)\n\n195.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal incorporated the prior decision to the Award. Consequently both decisions comprise the Award, which may be subject to this annulment proceeding.\n\n**C. The Award is Formed by two Decisions**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nIn the present case, the Award was formed by two juridical acts, issued at different procedural times that complement each other: (i) the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability issued on January 14, 2010 and (ii) the Award issued on March 28, 2011.\n\n197.\n\nThe formal terminology given by the Tribunal to the \"Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\" and to the \"Award\" is of no importance to the Committee because what matters is the substance and content of the decisions. The Committee finds that the Tribunal disposed of the case in its entirety through both decisions jointly considered, notwithstanding they were issued at different procedural times. Based on such premise, the Award should be envisioned as composed by two separate decisions that complement each other: (i) the decision on jurisdiction and liability, (ii) and the decision on causation and quantum.\n\n198.\n\nSince it is undisputed that the Award incorporates the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, all the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules that concern the drafting, content and issuance of the award apply to both decisions.\n\n199.\n\nUnder such statement, the decisions, jointly considered, constitute the Award and therefore, are subject to grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**D. Respondent\u2019s Right To Object the Content of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability Was Waived in Accordance with Arbitration Rule 27**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nRespondent seeks the annulment of both the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and of the Award. However, the Committee considers that Respondent\u2019s right to claim the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability deems waived in light of Arbitration Rule 27. The express terms of Arbitration Rule 27 are as follows:\n\n***A party which knows or should have known that a provision*** *of the Administrative and Financial Regulations,* ***of these Rules,*** *of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal* ***has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections*** *thereto, shall be deemed\u2014subject to Article 45 of the Convention\u2014to have* ***waived its right to object.***\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n201.\n\nThe waiver, provided by Arbitration Rule 27 applies with respect to the following claims:\n\ni. The Tribunal found a breach of the BIT based on a claim which Ukraine did not have an opportunity to dispute.\n\nii. The Award did not consider the implications of the Settlement Agreement (i.e. disregarded and failed to apply the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement). Additionally the Award disregarded the res judicata effect of the Lemire I Award.\n\niii. The Majority failed to state reasons in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability with respect to Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement\n\n202.\n\nThe claims previously referred entail (i) a procedural violation *(not having an opportunity to dispute a claim)* and (ii) a violation of a procedural rule or principle applicable to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in light of the analysis above and incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention197 and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i).198\n\nArticle 48(3): *\"The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\"*\n\nArbitration Rule 47(1)(i): *\"The award shall be in writing and shall contain: (...) the decision of the Tribunal on every questions submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision based (...).\"*\n\n203.\n\nThe waiver provided by Arbitration Rule 27 applies to the case at hand on the basis that Respondent knew or should have known about such violations since the moment the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was issued on January 14, 2010. Consequently, Respondent should have objected to such violations and should have reserved its rights to claim these objections in a subsequent annulment proceeding. There was no reason for Respondent to remain silent and wait until the Award was issued to object to the terms and content of the first decision. Respondent\u2019s silence amounts to a waiver of its rights to object to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability at the present stage.\n\n204.\n\nBelow, the Committee substantiates the applicability of Arbitration Rule 27 with respect to each of Respondent\u2019s claims.\n\n**1. The Tribunal found a breach of the BIT based on a claim which Ukraine did not have an opportunity to dispute**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Majority seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by having found a breach of the BIT based on a claim asserted for the first time in Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial on jurisdiction and liability that Respondent did not have an opportunity to dispute.\n\n206.\n\nWith respect to such claim, Respondent could have objected to such new allegation and could have requested from the Tribunal an opportunity to comment on it immediately after the Post-Hearing Memorial was submitted and even during the Hearing on remaining issues.199 Despite having the procedural opportunity to raise such objections and reserve its rights, Respondent did not object.\n\nIn the underlying arbitration, the parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs regarding jurisdiction and liability on March 4, 2009. The Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability on January 14, 2010. Afterwards, the Second Phase Arbitration on the remaining issues began. On July 12, 2010 the hearing on remaining issues took place.\n\n207.\n\nMoreover, Respondent alleges feeling aggravated by the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability because, according to Respondent, it is based on a claim (violation of the BIT (FET standard) for the illegal out-of-tender allocation of frequencies) it did not have the opportunity to dispute. In this respect, Respondent could have objected to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability before the Tribunal after its issuance, prior to the issuance of the Award, thus preserving its rights under Rule 27. Even more so when 14 months passed between the issuance of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (January 14, 2010) and the Award (March 28, 2011).\n\n208.\n\nAdditionally, at the end of the Hearing on remaining issues, Respondent was given a sufficient opportunity to raise any objections with regard to the procedure (i.e. the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability):\n\n*The Chairman: [...] So I will finalize this by asking both parties if, at this stage, they are aware of any breach of due process; and if they are aware of any breach of due process, they are kindly asked to state that, so that the Tribunal can take any corrective action.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The Chairman: Thank you very much Mr. Gharavi, Mr. Willems do you have\u2014I know after this introduction it\u2019s difficult now to suddenly say,* *\u2018Yes, we have a basic problem of due process \u2019. But please do feel free, if there is any problem of due process, it is the moment now to state it and we well take the corrective actions which are appropriate.*\n\n*Mr. Willems: We have no objections to assert. We likewise join the warm spirit of cordiality and thank everyone here.200*\n\nHearing on remaining issues, Tr. 274:6.\n\n209.\n\nNotwithstanding the clear opportunity given to Respondent by the Tribunal, to object to any procedural irregularity, thus preserving its rights under Rule 27, Respondent failed to raise the procedural violation of not having the opportunity to object to a new claim. The sanctions in the Arbitration Rules for the non-observance of time limits are of a procedural nature and entail the loss of the right to object. Such sanction is in the interest of procedural efficiency and avoids dilatory behavior of the parties.\n\n210.\n\nIn the case at hand, if Respondent felt aggravated by the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability for resolving an allegation Respondent did not have the opportunity to dispute, Respondent should have objected and reserved its rights immediately after issuance of the Decision and until the Award was issued, including during the Hearing on remaining issues. By not raising objections, this Committee finds that, according to Arbitration Rule 27, Respondent waived its right to object to the decision\u2019s contents at the present stage.\n\n211.\n\nSchreuer\u2019s Commentary on Arbitration Rule 27, included in the discussion of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention is consistent with such determination. He states that a party that is aware of a procedural violation should react immediately objecting its violation. Otherwise, its failure to do so will be interpreted as a waiver to object at a later stage of the proceedings:\n\n*[...] a party that is aware of a violation of proper procedure must react immediately by stating its objection and by demanding compliance. Under Arbitration Rule 27,failure to do so will be interpreted as a waiver to object at a later stage. (See para. 60 supra). Rule 27 does not refer to annulment proceedings expressis verbis, but Rule 53 extends the applicability of the Arbitration Rules to annulment in general terms. It follows that a party that has failed to protest against a perceived procedural irregularity before the tribunal is precluded from claiming that this irregularity constituted a serious departure from fundamental rule of procedure for purposes of annulment.* ***To hold otherwise would mean that a party could leave a procedural irregularity unopposed to keep it in store as ammunition against a possible unfavourable award in annulment proceedings*** *(see also paras. 124-129, 174 supra)[...].201*\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nSchreuer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" p. 983, **\u00b6** 262.\n\n212.\n\nMoreover, Schreuer states that a party that has failed to object to a violation of procedure before the tribunal may not rely on this violation as a ground for annulment:\n\n*Ad hoc committees have held that a party that has failed to object to a violation of procedure before the tribunal may not rely on this violation as* *a ground for annulment. In Klockner I, the* ad hoc *Committee remarked in the context of an alleged violation of Article 52(1)(d) that an application for annulment \"... [cannot] be used by one party to complete or develop an argument which could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding... \". More specifically, in the context of an alleged violation of the right to be heard (see paras. 309-311 supra), the* ad hoc *Committee said:*\n\n*...it suffices to note that the Claimant has not established that it made a timely protest against the serious procedural irregularities it now complains of. Subject to what will be said later, Rule 26 [now Rule 27] of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings would therefore rule out a good part of its complaints.202*\n\n*Ibid,* p. 983, **\u00b6** 263.\n\n213.\n\nThis Committee finds that Respondent failed to object to a procedural violation (i.e. *not having an opportunity to dispute a claim asserted for the first time in the Post-Hearing Memorial)* before the tribunal and consequently may not rely on this violation as a ground for annulment.\n\n214.\n\nIn the Annulment case of *CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles* the committee noted that the Republic had the opportunity to raise its objection prior to the issuance of the award, and since it did not, its objection was deemed waived. Expressly, the committee stated that:\n\n*As an initial matter, the Republic's allegation appears vulnerable to the point that it failed to challenge Sir Anthony's alleged improper conduct at any time prior to the issuance of the Award, even though all of the conduct to which objection now is made (excluding the fact of the Award itself) occurred not later than during the preliminary hearing. It is arguable that a timely objection or challenge under Article 57 of the Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 would have been the appropriate remedy and that this complaint effectively has been waived and is therefore simply inadmissible. This conclusion is confirmed by Note B. to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (last published in 1975 as part of ICSID/4/Rev.l (\"ICSID Regulations And Rules\"): A proposal to disqualify an arbitrator must be filed promptly, and under any event before the proceeding is declared closed (see Rule 38). Promptness must be measured relative to the time when the proposing party first learns of the grounds for possible disqualification. If it receives this information so late that it can no longer make a proposal before the proceedings is declared closed, its remedy is to request an annulment of the award pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention (Rule 50). In the absence of having challenged Sir Anthony on the basis now asserted at any time during the 147 days that followed the conclusion of the preliminary hearing on July 23, 2003 and issuance of* *the Award on December 17, 2003 the Republic must be deemed to have waived any such objection...203*\n\n**Exhibit RAL-5,** *CDC Group pic v. Republic of the Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of June 29, 2005, \u00b6 53.\n\n215.\n\nThe above-cited case illustrates how objections regarding a procedural irregularity should be filed timely, if not, pursuant to procedural economy, they deem waived.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent had no reason to wait to complain about procedural irregularities (i.e. not having the opportunity to dispute a claim) that were known to it since the issuance of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability on January 14, 2010. To hold otherwise would be against procedural economy and would mean it was correct for Respondent to leave such procedural irregularity as future ammunition against a possible unfavorable award.\n\n**2. The Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability did not consider the implications of the Settlement Agreement (i.e. disregarded and failed to apply the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement) and disregarded the res judicata effect of the Lemire I Award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe waiver provided by Arbitration Rule 27 applies to the claim related to the absence of consideration in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability of the implications of the Settlement Agreement and the res judicata effect of the Lemire I. To explain how the waiver applies with respect to this claim, the Committee observes that Arbitration Rule 27 provides certain prerequisites that have to be met in order for the waiver to apply:\n\ni. *A party which knows or should have known*\n\nii. *that a provision of*\n\n(1) *the Administrative and Financial Regulations,*\n\n(2) *of these Rules,*\n\n(3) *of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding,*\n\n(4) *or of an order of the Tribunal*\n\niii. *has not been complied with*\n\niv. *and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto.*\n\n218.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Committee finds that the previous prerequisites were met, based on the following reasons:\n\ni. ***A party which knows or should have known:*** First, the Parties knew from the moment the Tribunal issued the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (on January 14, 2010) that the Award was going to be constituted by two independent juridical acts, issued at different procedural times.\n\nThe previous fact was known to the Parties from the content of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in the following terms:\n\n*The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the changes suffered by the Ukrainian and the world economy since the dates when the expert reports* *were prepared, and its effects on the quantum of the damage, require further investigation. Furthermore, the assumptions underlying the experts\u2019 reports do not coincide with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in this Decision and the quantum evidence therefore requires recalibration in accordance with the present decision. Consequently, the question of the appropriate redress of the breach, including the quantification of the damages, will be addressed in a short second phase of this arbitration. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal will issue a Procedural Order for the continuation of the procedure.204*\n\n*ii.*  ***that a provision of these Rules:*** Respondent and Claimant knew that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was already part of the Award and therefore said decision had to comply with the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), specifically because said decision resolved in its entirety all the jurisdictional and liability disagreements between the Parties and therefore, in this Committee\u2019s view, such ruling had to resolve all the questions submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal on these two issues and had to express all the reasons on which it was based.\n\niii. ***has not been complied with:*** From Respondent assertions it is clear that Ukraine contends a violation of the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i), specifically, as mentioned, to the requisites consisting in (i) the Award having to deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal and (ii) the Tribunal having to state the reasons upon which their findings were based.\n\niv. ***and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto:*** Respondent felt that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability violated the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i), however it failed to state promptly its objections thereto.\n\nv. ***Waived its right to object:*** Based on Respondent having failed to state promptly its objections, Respondent right to object the contents of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is deemed to be waived.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, January 14, 2010, \u00b6 425\n\n219.\n\nTaking into consideration the above, the specific reasons that justify the applicability of the waiver with respect to each of the claims asserted by Respondent are the following:\n\n*i.*  ***The Majority manifestly exceeded its powers since it dismissed the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement.205***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, 155-170. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, 92 and 93.\n\n220.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Clauses 10 to 12 of the Settlement Agreement206 were not even addressed nor considered by the Majority in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Moreover, Respondent argues that paragraph 185 of the Award, summarily dismissed Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the waiver contained in Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement.207\n\n**Exhibit RA-23,** Settlement Agreement dated March 20, 2000, Clause 10: *\"The Parties agree and confirm that all claims, complaints and requests contained in the Consent to Arbitrate, Notice for Arbitration, Ancillary Claims and all other official letters of the Claimant to the Respondent or ICSID, as well as other correspondence of the Claimant addressed to third parties are hereby settled\".*  \nClause 11: *\"By such settlement the Parties, in the event of compliance with this Agreement, exclude all of the claims referred to in item 10 of Section 11 \"Settlement of the Dispute\" from any further judicial or arbitration settlement. \"*  \nClause 12: *\"The Parties acknowledge the absence of any claims or misunderstandings between them as on the date of singing this Agreement. \"*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 166.\n\n221.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent claims that the Majority did not analyze the terms of Clause 13(b) of the Settlement Agreement208 or considered the letter from Mr. Aksenenko,209 which demonstrated Claimant\u2019s awareness of the practice taking place during the Interregnum Period.\n\n**Exhibit RA-23,** Settlement Agreement dated March 20, 2000, Clause 13(b): *\"As a good-will gesture, the Respondent agrees to fulfill the following additional conditions of the Claimant for the purpose of this settlement under the schedule below, (b) By May 15, 2000 the Respondent, in person of the State Committee on Communications and Information Technology, agrees to use its best possible efforts to consider in a positive way the application of the Gala Radio to provide it with the licenses for radio frequencies (provided there are free frequencies bands) in the following cities Kharkiv, Lviv, Donetsk Zaporizhya, Lugansk, Simpheropol, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Vynnitsa, Kryviy Rog, Uzhgorod. \"*\n\n**Exhibit RA-22,** Letter from National Council Member Mr. S. Aksenenko to Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mr. S. L. Tyhypko, September 28, 1999.\n\n222.\n\nThe Committee observes that this claim regards a violation of the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i); specifically, the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability not dealing with every question submitted to the Tribunal *(i.e. Applicability and scope of Clauses 10 to 12 of the Settlement Agreement).* Such violation should have been objected to earlier, not at the present stage of the annulment.\n\n***ii. Failure to apply the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement210***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 171-182. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 84-96.\n\n223.\n\nRespondent alleges that the Majority failed to apply the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement and therefore argues that it is a non-application of the law and a manifest excess of the Tribunal\u2019s powers.211\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 181. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6 91.\n\n224.\n\nThe Committee observes that this claim regards a violation of the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i); specifically, the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability not dealing with every question submitted to the Tribunal *(i.e. Applicability and scope of Clauses 10 to 12 of the Settlement Agreement).* Such violation should have been objected to earlier, not at the present stage of the annulment.\n\n***iii. The Majority disregarded the res judicata effect of Lemire I with respect to the illegal allocation of frequencies during the Interregnum Period and therefore manifestly exceeded its power.212***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 189-207. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 110-118.\n\n225.\n\nRespondent alleges that the Majority disregarded the res judicata effect of the award rendered in Lemire I and claims that it amounts to a non-application of international law and a manifest excess of powers.213\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 204.\n\n226.\n\nAgain, the Committee observes that this claim regards a violation of the procedural rule or principle recognized in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i); specifically, the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability not dealing with every question submitted to the Tribunal *(i.e. Applicability and scope of Clauses 10 to 12 of the Settlement Agreement).* Such violation should have been objected to earlier, not at the present stage of the annulment.\n\n***iv. The Majority failed to state reasons in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability with respect to Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement.214***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 183-188. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 97-109.\n\n227.\n\nRespondent argues that the Majority did not explain nor provide reasons to reject the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement.215\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 186.\n\n228.\n\nThis claim regards an express violation of the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i); specifically, the prerequisite that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability had to state the reasons upon which its findings were based. Such violation should have been objected to earlier, not at the present stage of the annulment.\n\n229.\n\nRespondent\u2019s failure to object to the violations of the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) at any time during the 14 months that followed the issuance of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (January 14, 2010) until the Award (March 28, 2011) amounts to a waiver of its rights to object at the present time. And therefore, all annulment claims made in connection with the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability are dismissed per Arbitration Rule 27.\n\n230.\n\nThe above conclusion makes unnecessary and moot any analysis regarding Respondent\u2019s argument that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability did not consider the implications of the Settlement Agreement (i.e. disregarded and failed to apply the waiver provided by Clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement) and disregarded the res judicata effect of the Lemire I Award. However, the decision on this issue would have still favored Claimant, as the Committee considers that such allegation is without merit in light of the very high standards established in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**E. Whether the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability Acquired Res Judicata Effect is Irrelevant to the Application of Arbitration Rule 27**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Parties disagreed on when the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability became res judicata (meaning final and binding). In this respect, Claimant claims that such decision became final or binding once it was incorporated in an award, while Respondent alleges that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability had res judicata effect from the moment it was issued.\n\n232.\n\nThe Committee considers irrelevant whether the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability acquired res judicata effect because under Arbitration Rule 27, if Respondent felt that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability violated the procedural rule or principle incorporated in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i), Respondent should have objected to its terms or reserved its rights before the Tribunal immediately after the issuance of the Decision and prior to the issuance of the Award. No other conclusion can be derived from a strict application of Arbitration Rule 27,\n\n**VIII. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS ON THE CLAIMS REGARDING THE ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Scope of an Annulment Proceeding**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe fundamental goal of the ICSID system is to assure the finality of the ICSID arbitration award.216 In this respect, the Committee agrees with Claimant that the annulment proceeding concerns serious procedural irregularities in the decisional process rather than an appeal on the merits. The limited and exceptional nature of the annulment remedy provided by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention forbids an inquiry on the substance of the case, on the misapplication of the law or on mistakes in analyzing the facts.217\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, prepared by the ICSID Secretariat, dated August 10, 2012, p. 29, paragraph 72.\n\nReport of Secretary-General Ibrahim F.I. Shihata to the Administrative Council at its Twentieth Annual Meeting 3 (October 2, 1986): \"The history of the Convention makes it clear that the draftsmen intended to: (i) assure the finality of the ICSID awards; (ii) distinguish carefully an annulment proceeding form an appeal; and (iii) construe narrowly the ground for annulment, so that this procedure remained exceptional.\n\n234.\n\nBased on the above, this Committee will exercise its jurisdiction under a narrow and limited mandate, restricted to analyzing only the legitimacy of the Award and not its correctness.218\n\n**Exhibit CAL-22,** *M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Decision on Annulment \u00b6 24\n\n235.\n\nIn the case at hand, Respondent relied on three grounds set forth in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention to request the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability together with the Award: *(i) manifest excess of powers; (ii) departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; (iii) failure to state reasons.*\n\n236.\n\nIt is important to stress that this Committee will only address the grounds and claims presented by Respondent regarding the annulment of the Award (decision on causation and quantification). The other claims regarding the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability ought to be disregarded based on the reasons set forth in Section VII of this Decision.\n\n**1. Manifest excess of powers: Article 52(1)(b)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nA manifest excess of powers as a ground for annulment relates either to jurisdiction or to the failure to apply the proper law.219 With respect to the latter, prior *ad hoc* committee decisions have determined that the Tribunal\u2019s acting *ex aequo et bono* without agreement of the parties to do so could also constitute a manifest excess of powers.220 Nonetheless, an erroneous application of the law cannot amount to a basis for annulment.221\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, prepared by the ICSID Secretariat, dated August 10, 2012, p. 42, \u00b6 82.\n\n**Exhibit RAL-1,** *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

Secondly, that the Majority\u2019s determination on causation went beyond the scope of liability defined in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n239.\n\nThe Committee considers that Respondent\u2019s claims are inadmissible within the framework of Article 52(1)(b).\n\n240.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have identified an approach to determining whether there has been a manifest excess of powers. It is a two-step analysis, that Respondent duly invoked, which consists in determining whether there was an excess of powers and, if so, whether the excess was manifest.222 In the case at hand, this Committee finds, under the first step of the analysis that there was no excess of powers. This finding obviates the need for the Committee to perform the second step of the analysis, regarding whether the excess was \"manifest.\"\n\n**Exhibit RAL-35,** *Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010, \u00b6 212; **Exhibit** **RAL-10,** *Fraport Ag Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide* v. *Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on the Application for Annulment, December 23, 2010, \u00b6 40; **Exhibit CAL-36,** *AES* *Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Eromi) Kft.* v. *Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Decision on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2012, \u00b6 32.\n\n***i. The Majority\u2019s failure to apply its own theory of causation*** ***amounts to non-application of the proper law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn order to determine whether there was a manifest excess of powers regarding the applicable law, the Committee deems important to determine what is understood by \"applicable law.\" In this respect, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.*\n\n242.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Committee believes that the Tribunal did identify the applicable law with regards to the standard of causation, *i.e. International Law Commission\u2019s Article 36.1 on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.* The Tribunal even cited such general principle in the Award: *\"The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby)\"223*\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 155.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal further provided that injured claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that the claimed quantum of compensation flows from the host State\u2019s conduct, and that the causal relationship is sufficiently close (i.e. not \"too remote\"). The Tribunal additionally stated that it was left to arbitrators to define and give content to the specific elements required for causation:\n\n*But beyond this general principle, the ILA Articles remain silent on the particulars of the issue. It is therefore left to judges and arbitrators to define and give content to the specific elements required. The supplementary guidance is provided in Article 39 of the ILC Articles entitled \"Contribution to the injury\u2019' which states... \u2019\u2019[i]n the* *determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity to whom reparation is sought.224*\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 155.\n\n244.\n\nThen, the Tribunal defined and addressed each of the elements required for causation:\n\na. In paragraphs 158 to 160 of the Award225 the Tribunal addressed the initial cause, and then in paragraphs 161 and 162 of the Award the Tribunal addressed the \"effect\" element:226\n\nb. As for the causal link, the Tribunal held that two links in the causal chain had to be proven: (i) that assuming the tenders were decided in a fair and equitable manner and Claimant had participated in them, Claimant could have won the disputed frequencies; and (ii) if with such frequencies, Mr. Lemire would have been able to grow Gala into the broadcasting company he had planned.227\n\nc. In this regard, the Tribunal held that it was likely that Gala Radio would have been awarded licenses if the National Council had proceeded legally.228 At paragraphs 205 to 207 of the Award, the Tribunal held that Gala Radio was a reasonably funded company that had the financial strength and know-how to develop Gala Radio into the successful broadcasting company Mr. Lemire had planned.229\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAward dated March 28.2011, \u00b6 171.\n\nThe reasons for its determination were that Gala Radio it was one of the most successful radio operators in Kyiv and because it met the criteria set forth in the Law.\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011. \u00b6 205-207.\n\n245.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal identified the applicable legal standard with respect to causation. Furthermore, the Committee considers that what Respondent is really contending is that the Tribunal incorrectly applied the test that it had itself enunciated, not that it failed to apply it.\n\n246.\n\nIn this line of thought, the Committee notes that the Tribunal in paragraphs 173 to 202 of the Award analysed whether, assuming that the tenders were decided in a fair and equitable manner and Claimant had participated in them, Claimant could have won the frequencies required to create a national FM broadcaster and an AM channel for talk radio. In analysing this issue, the Tribunal concluded, *inter alia.* (1) that of 80 plus licences that were awarded during the Interregnum Period, Gala Radio should have received, no later than January 1, 2001, at least the 14 frequencies required to create a national FM broadcaster; and (2) that if the May 26, 2004, National Council Decision had been properly adopted, Gala Radio, by far the best qualified of the three competitors in the tender, should have been the winner.230\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 173 to 202.\n\n247.\n\nMoreover, the Committee notes that the Tribunal in paragraphs 203 to 207 of the Award also analysed whether having received the frequencies referred to in the paragraph above, would have enabled Gala Radio to develop into the successful broadcasting company that Mr. Lemire had planned. In analysing this issue, the Tribunal concluded, *inter alia,* that Gala Radio was a reasonably well funded corporation and that it had the financial strength and the necessary know how to successfully operate the two radio channels.231\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 203 to 207.\n\n248.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the Tribunal concluded that Claimant was able to prove that the initial cause (Ukraine\u2019s wrongful acts) and the final effect (Claimant\u2019s frustration to fulfil his business plans) are linked through a chain of causation, and that this chain is proximate and foreseeable.\n\n249.\n\nNow, the Committee finds that Respondent disagrees with the above analysis of the Tribunal, in that, according to Respondent, the Tribunal should have particularized *\"which frequencies, in which cities, with which power, and pursuant to which tenders (won against which competitors) Gala Radio would have probably won [....] \"232* In other words, Respondent considers that the application of the causation test enunciated by the Tribunal required a more detailed and specific analysis that should have included, *inter alia,* an analysis of the frequencies, the cities, the power of each frequency, the circumstances of each tender, etc.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 275. *See also* Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 249.\n\n250.\n\nIt is clear to the Committee that Respondent\u2019s arguments in regards to this matter refer to a difference of criteria as to the proper application of the Tribunal\u2019s causation test, which does not amount to a non-application of the law and much less to a manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)). Therefore, Respondent\u2019s allegations must fail in the context of this annulment proceeding.\n\n251.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s finding is consistent with the findings of previous *ad hoc committees* that have stated that the *\"error in judicando'* cannot in itself be accepted as a ground for annulment without indirectly allowing an appeal against the arbitral award.233\n\n**Exhibit RAL-13,** *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soc\u00ed\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* ICSID Case ARB/81/2, Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, \u00b6 61.\n\n252.\n\nFurthermore, with respect to the argument related to the fact that the *\"Majority\u2019s determination on causation went beyond the scope of liability defined in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and therefore the Tribunal acted* ex aequo et bono, *without party authorization and in a manifest excess of its powers)'*234 the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not determine the issue of causation *ex aequo et bono.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6 121.\n\n253.\n\nA tribunal acts *ex aequo et bono* when it decides on equity while it is required to decide in law. In the present case, the Tribunal decided in law and even acted in accordance with Respondent assertions:\n\n***The Tribunal agrees with Respondent***  *that it is a general principle of international law that injured claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that the claimed quantum of compensation flows from the host State\u2019s conduct, and that the causal relationship is sufficiently close (i.e. not \"too remote\"). The duty to make reparation extends only to those damages which are legally regarded as the consequence of an unlawful act.235*\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 155.\n\n254.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal did not act *ex aequo et bono* but in accordance with the law and consistent with Respondent\u2019s position.\n\n255.\n\nFollowing the Committee\u2019s conclusion that the Tribunal did not fail to apply the proper law, the Committee finds no need to address Respondent\u2019s arguments that (1) the application of the proper law would have made a difference to the outcome,236 or (2) the Tribunal committed an egregious misapplication of the proper law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20.\n\n***ii. The Majority\u2019s findings in relation to causation*** ***disregarded the res judicata effect of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nRespondent alleges that the Majority concluded in the Award that under the hypothesis that Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts had not occurred, Gala Radio should have received, no later than January 1, 2001, at least the 14 frequencies required to operate a nationwide FM music network. This holding in the Award, according to Respondent, is inconsistent with the Majority\u2019s findings on liability in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n257.\n\nTo support its allegation, Respondent claims that the 14 frequencies identified by Claimant during the Hearing on remaining issues corresponded to radio frequency licenses allocated by the State Committee to other broadcasters during the Interregnum Period, and that these 14 frequencies were not awarded by the National Council during the tender announced on January 1, 2001.\n\n258.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that the Award determined that Gala Radio would have obtained these 14 additional frequencies \"[i]f the National Council had proceeded properly to award the new licenses\" in accordance with the applicable law, and that Gala Radio was \"well placed\" to win the relevant tenders. This determination, according to Respondent, necessarily assumes that the five tenders pursuant to which these 14 frequencies were allocated did not comply with the Law on Broadcasting, and somehow fell short of the FET standard in the BIT.\n\n259.\n\nRespondent concludes by stating that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability did not find that any of these five tenders had been carried out in violation of the BIT. Therefore, continues the Respondent, the Majority\u2019s determination on causation disregarding the res judicata effect of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n260.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee considers that the underlying issue in Respondent\u2019s allegation is whether the 14 frequencies that the Tribunal considered Gala Radio would have secured to achieve a national FM coverage (but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing) are the same frequencies identified by Claimant during the Hearing on remaining issues. According to Respondent, the frequencies identified by Claimant during the Hearing on remaining issues were allocated in tenders that were not found to be in violation of the BIT in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n261.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal did not determine that the 14 frequencies identified by Claimant in the Hearing on remaining issues are the same 14 frequencies it considered Gala Radio would have secured to operate a nationwide FM network, but for Respondent\u2019s wrongdoings. The Tribunal simply asserted, *inter alia,* that \"Claimant has averred - and Respondent has not disputed - that with additional licences in 14 locations, Gala Radio would have been able to cover the whole country.\" Such 14 frequencies, according to the Tribunal, should have been awarded to Gala Radio no later than January 1, 2001 and are part of the 80 plus frequencies that were issued by the Executive Branch of the Government during the period between 16 March 1999 and June 9, 2000, when the National Council was not operative.\n\n262.\n\nThe Committee finds that to analyse whether Respondent\u2019s allegations in this matter merit annulment, it would have to agree with Respondent that the 14 frequencies referred to by the Tribunal in its analysis of causation are the same 14 frequencies that, according to Respondent, were identified by Claimant in the Hearing on remaining issues. The Committee finds that the Award does not support this contention and must therefore dismiss this ground for annulment.\n\n**2. Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: Article 52(1)(d)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***i. The Majority\u2019s ruling on causation warrants annulment*** ***because it seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Claimant that to trigger Article 52(1)(d) the departure must be serious and must relate to a fundamental principle of natural justice.237*Ad hoc,* committees have consistently held that not every departure from a fundamental rule of procedure justifies annulment. Within the examples of fundamental rule of procedure identified by *ad hoc* committees are: (i) the equal treatment of the parties;239 (ii) the right to be heard;238 (iii) an independent and impartial tribunal;240 (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof;241 and (v) deliberations among members of the Tribunal.242\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment, April 23, 2012, **\u00b6\u00b6** 53 and 55.\n\n**Exhibit RAL-1,** *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

Consequently, Respondent claims that paragraphs 186 and 187 of the Award support Claimant\u2019s new arguments that Ukraine did not have an opportunity to dispute.\n\n265.\n\nFrom the Hearing Transcripts, it is clear that Claimant did not introduce a new theory but rather gave an example of how a national network would be built with a single combination, out of many.243 The Committee believes that Claimant\u2019s argument regarding the 14 frequencies was a mere example that did not change nor had an influence on the Parties\u2019 positions and the Tribunal\u2019s determination.\n\nHearing on remaining issues, Tr. 23-24:24-10: *\"That means that with 14 of the frequencies of the 38 we mentioned, we would have been able to cover the whole country, and with seven, two-thirds of the country.*  ***This is only one example***  *that we just wanted to bring the Tribunal\u2019s attention to, because*  ***there are multiple other possibilities.***  *If we hadn\u2019t been excluded, we could have applied to many other frequencies and have many other combinations.*  ***We just wanted to give a proper example***  *with the seven frequencies for the two-thirds of the coverage, and seven more with 100% of the coverage \".* (Emphasis added)\n\n266.\n\nDespite the above, the Committee finds that the question of whether the 14 frequencies was an example of a hypothetical network is irrelevant for the proceedings at hand. The real issue to be determined by the Committee is whether Claimant had an opportunity to rebut such arguments. And the Committee believes it did, based on the following reasons.\n\n267.\n\nFirst, Claimant asserts that Respondent addressed Claimant\u2019s arguments244 on the 14 frequencies made during the Hearing on remaining issues.245 In this respect, the Committee considers that in fact Respondent\u2019s counsel, Ms. Mouraviova, did refer to such arguments in the following terms:\n\n*MS. MOURAVIOVA:*\n\n*The third element of the review of these charts by the claimant that*  ***came out in the opening statement\u2014and was new\u2014is that claimant highlighted seven frequencies in yellow and seven frequencies in green***  *in the exhibit bundle chart under number 9, which is also respondent Exhibit R-209,*  ***and said that either seven green frequencies or seven yellow frequencies could have allowed him to have national coverage defined by him as two-thirds of the population covered.***  *In fact none of these frequencies were put to tender on January 1st 2001, but for other tenders, from 2001 to 2003 actually, and therefore Gala Radio could have participated to these tenders, but again did not participate. Therefore the fact that Gala Radio did not receive any of these frequencies was not caused at all, let alone proximately caused, by the breach of the FET standard of the BIT as decided by the Tribunal.246*\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nHearing on remaining issues, Tr. 23-24: 16-2: \"I kindly ask you to turn to tab 9. You will see in tab 9, which R-209 is, that to complement its network in fact claimant has identified seven frequencies which would have enabled it to cover two-thirds of the population. That\u2019s highlighted in yellow. We stayed conservative, because we can also add that what\u2019s highlighted in green, in tab 9, still, is seven more frequencies that would have allowed Gala to cover that time 100% of the country. That means with 14 of the frequencies of the 38 that we mentioned, we would have been able to cover the whole country; and with seven, two-thirds of the country.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment, April 23, 2012, \u00b6 234.\n\nHearing on remaining issues, Tr. 260-261:25-16.\n\n268.\n\nThe above transcription proves that Respondent referred to the 14 frequencies that, according to Claimant, should have been allocated to Gala Radio.\n\n269.\n\nSecond, the Committee finds the Tribunal\u2019s denial of Mr. Kurus\u2019 rebuttal direct examination was consistent with the Procedural rules previously agreed by the Parties and the Tribunal.247 The Parties agreed during a Pre-hearing conference held on July 2, 2010, on the rules regarding the cross-examination of witnesses *(i.e. witnesses could not testify in direct examination beyond their witness statement).* In this regard, the Parties consented to and were aware of the procedural framework applicable to the examination of the witnesses. Therefore, admitting such rebuttal would have necessarily violated the procedural rules agreed by the Parties and the Tribunal.\n\nHearing on remaining issues, Tr. 100-101:4-24: \"In this specific case\u2014and I was anticipating that we would end up in this situation, we have been speaking about this in our telephone conversation\u2014I think at the end that justice is best served if we stick to the three principles which would have been adhering to throughout the procedure. The first one is that witnesses are not examined on points which are not in their witness statement; secondly, that they are just introduced by their counselor who has presented them; and the third point, which I think is important, is that factual assertions by lawyers do not carry any weight in themselves, but they only carry the weight which is proven by the record.\n\n270.\n\nThird, the Committee agrees with Claimant that despite the fact that paragraphs 186 and 187 of the Award were supported only by Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, it does not prove that the Tribunal relied solely on such arguments to reach its conclusions. The Tribunal was aware that *\"[...] factual allegations will be checked by the Tribunal. If they are proven by the record, they will be taken as proven by the record''248* Tribunals are not obliged to cite and refer to every exhibit on the record in support of their conclusions.249 Therefore the Committee cannot assume with total certainty that the Tribunal did not analyze all the record to make such determination, but would have exclusively relied upon Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement.\n\nHearing on remaining issues, Tr. 99:18-21.\n\n**Exhibit RAL-9,** *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp.

Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Decision of September 16, 2011, \u00b6 98.\n\n271.\n\nFinally, assuming that the Tribunal did commit a procedural violation, Respondent did not make use of the opportunity given by the Tribunal at the Hearing on remaining issues to object to it:\n\n*The Chairman: [...] So I will finalize this by asking both parties if, at this stage, they are aware of any breach of due process; and if they are aware of any breach of due process, they are kindly asked to state that, so that the Tribunal can take any corrective action.*\n\n*Mr. Willems: We have no objections to assert. We likewise join the warm spirit of cordiality and thank everyone here.*\n\n272.\n\nBy not making a timely protest against what it now alleges is a serious procedural violation, under Article 27 of the ICSID Convention, such violation is deemed waived.250 In this respect, Schreuer\u2019s Commentary on Arbitration Rule 27, included in the discussion of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, previously cited in paragraphs 213 and 214 of this Decision, supports this determination. It clearly provides that a party that is aware of a procedural violation should react immediately by objecting to the violation. Otherwise, failure to do so will be interpreted as a waiver of the right to object at a later stage of the proceedings.251 Moreover, it states that a party that has failed to object to a violation of procedure before the arbitral tribunal may not rely on this violation as a ground for annulment.\n\nArbitration Rule 27: *A party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed\u2014subject to Article 45 of the Convention\u2014to have waived its right to object.*\n\nSchreuer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" pp. 983, 994-996, \u00b6 262.\n\n273.\n\nRespondent refers to **Fraport v. Philippines** to assert that he could not have forfeited its right to complain in the annulment proceeding because it did not know the eventual significance of these allegations, before reading the Award. The Committee considers that the circumstances of **Fraport v. Philippines** are not applicable to the case at hand.252 In this case, Respondent did not need to wait until the Award to realize that there was an alleged procedural violation.\n\n*Fraport v. Philippines* regards the presentation and analysis of new evidence, once the proceedings are closed by the Tribunal. The case at hand regards a \"procedural violation\" that Respondent was aware of and given the case, Respondent should have objected at the end of the Hearing on remaining issues.\n\n274.\n\nMoreover, Arbitration Rule 27 does not state that parties should only object to those procedural irregularities the eventual significance of which is known to the parties. Rather, its wording is broad and encompasses any procedural violation.253\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6 166.\n\n275.\n\nThe Committee considers contradictory that on the one hand, Respondent alleges that it was unfairly precluded from rebutting Claimant\u2019s allegations by not being allowed to directly examine Mr. Kurus. But on the other hand claims that he could not have known the significance that the Tribunal would grant to Claimant\u2019s allegations (that Mr. Kurus was intended to rebut).\n\n276.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee rejects Respondent\u2019s request for partial annulment of the Award on the grounds of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n***ii. Failure to state reasons: Article 52(1)(e)***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nFailure to state reasons as a ground for annulment is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning that parties can understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion:\n\n*The requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error offact or of law.254*\n\n**Exhibit RAL-16,** *Maritime International Nominees Establishment* v. *Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on Annulment, April 29, 1988, \u00b6 5.09.\n\n278.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. The correctness of the reasons is irrelevant in terms of this ground for annulment.\n\n279.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions. First, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed *rationale;* and, second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might.255\n\n**Exhibit RAL-7,** *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine* *Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment of July 3, 2002, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\n280.\n\nIn the present case, Respondent challenges the Tribunal\u2019s finding on causation because Respondent claims a failure to state the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s key determination regarding Gala Radio having been able to secure at least 14 radio stations to create a nationwide music radio network.\n\n281.\n\nSpecifically Respondent alleges that the failure to particularize the relevant tenders and to examine the causal link to the alleged damages constituted a significant *lacuna* in the Award. According to Respondent, the Majority\u2019s determination concerning Gala Radio\u2019s possibility of securing 14 FM frequencies was made without considering if there were pre-existing broadcasting rights of competitors, technical parameters of the frequencies allegedly required to obtain a national network, and Gala Radio\u2019s absence of participation in relevant tenders.256 Furthermore Respondent alleges that the Award is based on insufficient or inadequate reasons that warrant the annulment of the Award.257 In regard to such arguments, the Committee believes that what Respondent is really alleging, is the correctness or incorrectness of the causal link, not the failure to state the reasons.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 266. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Annulment, June 18, 2012, \u00b6 145.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Annulment Memorial, February 8, 2012, \u00b6 267.\n\n282.\n\nIn this regard, the Committee considers that the Award addressed causation in a comprehensible manner. In the Award, the Tribunal concluded that Claimant was able to prove that the initial cause - Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts - and the final effect -Claimant\u2019s frustration to fulfill his plans and operate a nationwide FM network plus an AM informational channel - were linked through a proximate and foreseeable chain of causation.258\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 208.\n\n283.\n\nThe Committee believes that the causal link is clearly set out in the Award. The Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the question of the causal link is perfectly understandable as to how the Tribunal arrived from point A - the breach of the FET standard by Ukraine - to point B - that without such breach it was probable that Claimant would have been able to have a national coverage.\n\n284.\n\nThe causal link is set forth from paragraph 163 to 179 of the Award. Whether it was right or wrong, that is not for the Committee to determine.\n\n285.\n\n[...]259\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 169.\n\n286.\n\nMoreover, it made it clear that the circumstances of the case required two links in the chain of events to be analyzed and proven: (i) whether the tenders had been hypothetically decided in a fair and equitable manner and, if Claimant had participated in them, whether it was probable that he would have won the disputed frequencies; and (ii) whether such frequencies would have enabled Gala Radio to achieve national coverage.260\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 171.\n\n287.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal decided that if the 80 frequencies during the Interregnum Period had been awarded legally, it is likely that Claimant would have won 14 of the required licenses to create a national FM network. The Tribunal based its opinion on the undisputed fact that at the time of the Interregnum Period, Gala Radio was one of the most successful radio operators in Kyiv and also met the criteria set forth in the Law.261\n\nAward dated March 28, 2011, \u00b6 179.\n\n288.\n\nSuch reasoning is clear and comprehensible. It was sufficient for the Tribunal to determine the likelihood of Gala Radio winning frequencies, based on objective factors. It is clear that Respondent\u2019s arguments are aimed not so much at the absence of reasons, but at the reasons themselves.\n\n289.\n\nIn view of the foregoing conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider Respondent\u2019s argument regarding a contradiction in the Award, since the Committee finds that the reasons stated were not contradictory but sufficiently clear for the Parties to understand the Tribunal\u2019s findings.\n\n290.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee rejects Respondent\u2019s application for partial annulment of the Award on the ground of failure to state reasons.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n291.\n\nRespondent alleges that in view of the *bona fide* nature of Respondent\u2019s annulment application, the *ad hoc* Committee should order the equal sharing of costs. On the other hand, Claimant claims that the costs incurred in this proceeding should follow the general rule that \"costs follow the event\" on the ground that Respondent\u2019s application for annulment was in fact an appeal.\n\n292.\n\nThis Committee considers that Ukraine\u2019s case before this Committee was not frivolous. Further, the Committee believes that Claimant\u2019s allegation regarding \"costs follow the event\" is not a mandatory principle the Committee is bound to apply. According to Articles 52(4) and 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has discretion to decide how and by whom fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges and fees of the Centre shall be paid. Further, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 2262 and Article 61 of the Washington Convention, the Committee shall take into account for the allocation of costs, Respondent\u2019s conduct in complying with the Decision on the Stay. Although Respondent did not post the security ordered in such decision within the timeframe established by the Committee, it finally entered with Claimant in an Escrow Agreement that guaranteed the payment of the Award in the event its annulment claim was denied.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2: \"Based on Article 61 of the Washington Convention, at the time the costs of this proceeding are allocated to the Parties, the Committee will take into account Respondent\u2019s conduct in complying with the Decision *[Decision on Ukraine\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated January 14, 2012].*\n\n293.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee decides that each party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses, and Respondent shall bear the ICSID fees.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n294.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES that:\n\n(a) The Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability cannot be subject to this annulment proceeding based on the reasons set forth in this Decision.\n\n(b) Respondent\u2019s claims regarding the annulment of the Award on the basis of a manifest excess of powers, departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and failure to state reasons, are rejected based on the reasons set forth in this Decision.\n\n(c) In accordance with the terms of Procedural Order No. 3, the Committee orders the immediate lift of the stay of enforcement of the Award and the immediate payment of the amount owed to Claimant, per the terms of section 5.1(a) of the Escrow Agreement between the Parties.\n\n(d) Each of the Parties shall bear its own legal fees and expenses, and Respondent shall bear the ICSID fees."}]}
