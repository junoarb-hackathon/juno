The present Decision comprises the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party dated 15 December 2023 (\u201cApplication\u201d) submitted by the Kingdom of Spain (\u201cSpain\u201d). Among other matters, it addresses whether Spain may be recognized as an amicus curiae or third person under the relevant conventional and procedural rules governing this arbitration, namely, Art. 10.20.3 of the TPA and Art. 4 of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (\u201cUNCITRAL Transparency Rules\u201d).\nII. BRIEF PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n2. On 14 December 2023, during the first of two days of public hearing on Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections pursuant to Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA (\u201cHearing\u201d), Spain sought leave to file a written submission in the arbitration as an amicus curiae.\n3. As noted above, Spain subsequently filed its Application on 15 December 2023.\n4. Later that same day, following the conclusion of the Hearing, the Tribunal requested the Parties\nto provide reasoned responses to the Application by no later than 22 December 2023.\n5. As discussed more fully below, Claimant argues that the Application should be rejected.1 Respondent, for its part, asks the Tribunal to \u201cdefer the substantive analysis on Spain\u2019s Application at least until a decision is made in the proceedings under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA;\u201d or, should the case advance to the merits and should Respondent submit an objection pursuant to Art. 10.20.4 of the TPA, until the resolution of such an objection.2\nIII. SPAIN\u2019S APPLICATION\n6. Spain seeks leave to intervene in this arbitration on the ground, it says, that \u201c[t]here is a legal dispute between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Colombia over the ownership of the remains of the Galleon San Jos\u00e9 \u2026 a Spanish Navy warship sunk in naval combat against an English squadron in 1708\u201d.3\n7. Spain contends that it has never abandoned its rights under international law as the flag State of the San Jos\u00e94, which rights derive from the \u201cprinciple of sovereign immunity of state vessels,\n1 Claimant\u2019s Response (\u201cResponse\u201d) to Spain\u2019s Application dated 22 December 2023, \u00b6\u00b61, 9.\n2 Respondent\u2019s Observations (\u201cObservations\u201d) on Spain\u2019s Application dated 22 December 2023, \u00b6\u00b61, 13 and footnote 1.\n3 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, 11, 20, 44.\nthe main consequence of which is the maintenance of the property of the flag state, in other words, the Kingdom of Spain.\u201d5\n8. Accordingly, in Spain\u2019s submission, \u201cthe San Jos\u00e9 and its remains [are] public property of the [Spanish] State, Spanish underwater cultural heritage and, therefore, with the legal nature of public domain according to [Spanish] domestic legislation.\u201d6\n9. Spain argues that \u201c[t]he exact location of the wreck is one of the questions that is still to be determined and could support the ultimate resolution of the case in favour of Spain \u2026\u201d7 According to Spain, \u201cColombia publicly maintains that the remains of the San Jos\u00e9 are in its territorial sea \u2026 [but] there are serious doubts about the exact location of the Galleon, which may be in whole or in part in the Colombian contiguous zone.\u201d8\n10. In any event, says Spain, \u201cindependently of the exact location of the wreck, according to domestic and international law the Galleon is Spanish public property.\u201d9 Moreover, the resting place of the San Jos\u00e9 is an archaeological site that \u201cshould be respected as a war grave.\u201d10\n11. According to Spain, its intervention in the arbitration is vital, \u201cas it could establish that Colombia, the Respondent, is not in fact the owner\u201d of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, which in turn means that \u201cnot only could the arbitral claim be dismissed, but the tribunal may lack jurisdiction to even hear the dispute.\u201d11 It claims that it seeks to \u201csafeguard its interests regarding the property of the Galleon,\u201d12 to defend \u201cits position\u201d with respect to the Galleon,13 to protect its \u201cunderwater cultural heritage,\u201d14 and generally to assist the Tribunal in respect of these issues.15\n5 Spain\u2019s Application \u00b6 29. In support of the principle of sovereign immunity of State vessels and aircraft Spain refers inter alia to Art. 3 of the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to the Immunity of State-owned Vessels (Brussels, 10 April 1926), Arts. 8 and 9 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas (29 April 1958), and various articles of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1983). Spain\u2019s Application \u00b6\u00b6 23-28.\n6 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b63. See also: \u00b634 referring to the Spanish Civil Code of 1889; Law 33/2003, of 3 November 2003, on Public Administration Patrimony; Law 48/1960, of 21 July 1960, on Air Navigation; the Commercial Code of 1885; Decree 2055/1969, of 25 September 1969, regulating the exercise of underwater activities; and Law 16/1985, of 25 June 1985, regulating Spanish Historical Heritage.\n7 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b612.\n8 Spain\u2019s Application \u00b6\u00b615-16.\n9 Spain\u2019s Application \u00b613.\n10 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b614, 17.\n11 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b641.\n12 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b66.\n13 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b637.\n14 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b642.\n12. According to Spain, the legitimacy of its intervention \u201carises from the fact that it has a right over the subject matter of the dispute in the present arbitration, for which reason, its position may be affected by any decision that may be rendered in these proceedings, and it must be heard and its rights must be clarified.16 Put differently: \u201cno right can be recognized to a third party on the basis of a property whose ownership is already in dispute.\u201d17\n13. In sum, Spain asks the Tribunal to: 18\n(i) grant it \u201cleave to intervene in the present proceedings\u201d;\n(ii) allow it to \u201cfile a written amicus curiae submission\u201d in which it \u201cdefends its position and explains to the Arbitral Tribunal why it considers the remains of the Galleon to be public property of the Kingdom of Spain\u201d;19\n(iii) allow it \u201caccess to the documents filed in the case, to the extent necessary for its intervention\u201d; and\n(iv) allow it to \u201cattend hearings in order to present oral arguments and respond to questions\u201d.\n14. As the legal basis for its intervention, Spain invokes Art. 4 of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, Art. 10.20.3 of the TPA and sections 13.2 and 13.3 of PO1.20\nIV. THE PARTIES\u2019 RESPONSES\nA) Claimant\u2019s Response\n15. Claimant asks the Tribunal to reject the Application as substantially deficient as well as \u201cdisruptive and premature and this stage of the proceedings.\u201d21\n16. First, it says, Spain has failed to comply with the requirements set out in Article 4(2) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules.22\n16 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b622.\n17 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b644.\n18 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b645.\n19 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b637.\n20 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b610.\n21 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b61.\n22 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b63.\n17. Second, Claimant considers the Application to be disruptive as it was filed in the middle of the Hearing, \u201cafter the Parties have already made their written and oral submissions and are weeks away from the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Respondent\u2019s Article 10.20.5 Preliminary Objections.\u201d23\n18. Finally, it says, \u201cSpain has failed to identify any factual or legal issue in the Art. 10.20.5 proceeding on which Spain would provide a helpful perspective to the Tribunal.\u201d24\n19. In Claimant\u2019s submission:\n\u201cSpain\u2019s purported ownership of the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck does not impact any of the Tribunal\u2019s considerations under Article 10.20.5, which are limited to Colombia\u2019s jurisdictional objections under the TPA, and have no relation to Spain\u2019s submissions on its purported ownership of the wreck under various other treaties, such as the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, to which Colombia is not even a party, or Spain\u2019s domestic law, which has no relevance to this dispute.\u201d25\n20. Claimant further notes that, \u201cto the extent Spain is seeking to intervene in the next phase of the arbitration, its submission is premature, as the Parties have not even filed their first set of written submissions on the merits\u201d, such that \u201cthe relevance of any submission Spain would make cannot yet be determined.\u201d26\n21. Should Spain\u2019s Application nonetheless be granted, Claimant requests that Spain be required to provide an undertaking on costs.27\nB) Respondent\u2019s Observations\n22. Respondent requests that the Tribunal defer the substantive analysis on Spain\u2019s Application, at least until a decision is made in the proceedings under Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA.28 This is because:\n(i) Respondent activated the expedited procedure in Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA, which mandates that the proceedings on the merits be suspended;\n23 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b64.\n24 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b65.\n25 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b65.\n26 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b66.\n27 Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b61, 9.\n28 Respondent\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b61, 13.\n(ii) the current proceedings are not about the ownership or property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9; and\n(iii) Spain\u2019s Application does not assist the Tribunal in the analysis of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. 29\n23. It adds that, should the case proceed to a merits phase, and in the event that Colombia elects to submit an objection pursuant to Art. 10.20.4 of the TPA in that phase, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Spain\u2019s Application should be deferred until the resolution of such an objection.30\n24. Echoing its submissions during the recent Hearing, Respondent argues that the arbitration \u201cis not about the property of San Jos\u00e9, since Claimant has never been recognized any rights over that specific shipwreck.\u201d31 Considering that the arbitration \u201cdoes not concern any property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, Spain has failed to prove any interest in the arbitral proceeding.\u201d32\n25. Moreover, it argues, Spain has failed to prove the extent to which its submission would assist the Tribunal in deciding any of Colombia\u2019s jurisdictional objections, that is, whether Claimant \u201c(i) is a protected investor; (ii) possesses a protected investment conferred pursuant to domestic law; (iii) submitted a claim requiring to necessarily pass judgment on pre-TPA State conduct and facts; or (iv) submitted a claim well beyond the three-year limitation period.\u201d33 Spain has, therefore, failed to demonstrate how it meets the requirements of Art. 4(3)(b) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules.\nV. DISCUSSION\n26. As stated above, Spain seeks leave to intervene in the present arbitration pursuant to Art. 10.20.3 of the TPA, Art. 4 of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules and Sections 13.1 and 13.2 of PO1.\n27. Article 10.20.3 of the TPA provides:\n\u201cThe tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider amicus curiae submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party. Each submission shall identify the author and any person or entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission.\u201d\n29 Respondent\u2019s Observations, \u00b65.\n30 Respondent\u2019s Observations, footnote 1.\n31 Respondent\u2019s Observations, \u00b66. See also: \u00b69.\n32 Respondent\u2019s Observations, \u00b611.\n33 Respondent\u2019s Observations \u00b612.\n28. Article 4 of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules is directly applicable to Spain\u2019s situation here:\nArticle 4. Submission by a third person\n1. After consultation with the disputing parties, the arbitral tribunal may allow a person that is not a disputing party, and not a non-disputing Party to the treaty (\u201cthird person(s)\u201d), to file a written submission with the arbitral tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute.\n2. A third person wishing to make a submission shall apply to the arbitral tribunal, and shall, in a concise written statement, which is in a language of the arbitration and complies with any page limits set by the arbitral tribunal:\n(a) Describe the third person, including, where relevant, its membership and legal status (e.g., trade association or other non-governmental organization), its general objectives, the nature of its activities and any parent organization (including any organization that directly or indirectly controls the third person);\n(b) Disclose any connection, direct or indirect, which the third person has with any disputing party;\n(c) Provide information on any government, person or organization that has provided to the third person (i) any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission; or (ii) substantial assistance in either of the two years preceding the application by the third person under this article (e.g. funding around 20 per cent of its overall operations annually);\n(d) Describe the nature of the interest that the third person has in the arbitration; and\n(e) Identify the specific issues of fact or law in the arbitration that the third person wishes to address in its written submission.\n3. In determining whether to allow such a submission, the arbitral tribunal shall take into consideration, among other factors it determines to be relevant:\n(a) Whether the third person has a significant interest in the arbitral proceedings; and\n(b) The extent to which the submission would assist the arbitral tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the arbitral proceedings by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties.\n4. The submission filed by the third person shall:\n(a) Be dated and signed by the person filing the submission on behalf of the third person;\n(b) Be concise, and in no case longer than as authorized by the arbitral tribunal;\n(c) Set out a precise statement of the third person\u2019s position on issues; and\n(d) Address only matters within the scope of the dispute.\n5. The arbitral tribunal shall ensure that any submission does not disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly prejudice any disputing party.\n6. The arbitral tribunal shall ensure that the disputing parties are given a reasonable opportunity to present their observations on any submission by the third party.\n(emphasis added)\n29. As for Procedural Order No. 1, Section 13 reads:\n13. Submissions from Non-Disputing Parties and Amicus Curiae\n13.1 Pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA, a non-disputing party to the TPA may make oral and written submissions regarding the interpretation of the TPA pursuant to the Procedural Calendar. The Parties may comment on any non-disputing party submissions in their rebuttal pleadings.\n13.2 Pursuant to Article 10.20.3 of the TPA, the Tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider amicus curiae submissions.\n13.3 Should the Tribunal receive a request for leave to make a non-disputing party or amicus curiae submission, the Tribunal will give the necessary directions, following consultation with the Parties.\n30. As stated in Art. 4(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, a \u201cthird person\u201d such as Spain \u2013 that is, a person that is neither \u201ca disputing party\u201d (in this case, SSA and Colombia) nor \u201ca non-disputing Party to the Treaty\u201d (here, the United States, which indeed filed a Non-Disputing Party submission) \u2013 must identify \u201cspecific issues of fact or law in the arbitration that the third person wishes to address in its written submission.\u201d\n31. Spain\u2019s Application does not do that. Instead, it focuses on the argument that the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 is Spain\u2019s property, which is not an issue in the arbitration. As both of the disputing parties have indicated numerous times in their written and oral pleadings, and as the Tribunal itself is cognizant, for the time being the entire question of ownership of the San Jos\u00e9 or its treasure \u2013 even as between SSA and Colombia \u2013 is not an issue to be determined by the Tribunal; and the question may never become such an issue if Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional plea is accepted.\n32. Spain may well have an \u201cinterest \u2026 in the arbitration\u201d (Art. 4(2)(d) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules), perhaps even a \u201csignificant interest in the arbitral proceedings\u201d (Art. 4(3)(a)). The Tribunal makes no findings in this regard, although it does of course take Spain\u2019s allegations in this respect into consideration. Yet even if these allegations are assumed to be correct, it would still be an insufficient basis on which to grant Spain\u2019s requests, in view of the second limb of Art. 4(3) which requires the Tribunal to consider:\n\u201c(b) The extent to which the submission [from a third person] would assist the arbitral tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the arbitral proceedings by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties.\u201d\n33. Throughout its Application, Spain asserts that there exists a legal dispute between itself and Colombia over the ownership of Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9. It provides no support whatsoever for this assertion, nor any specific information regarding the alleged basis, commencement, stage, status, forum or other particulars of any such dispute. The Tribunal is compelled to note (not that this point is in any way determinative) that this is the first and only time that it has heard of such \u201cdispute\u201d in these proceedings. Colombia itself says nothing in this regard in its Observations. Be that as it may, such a dispute could not arise under the TPA, from which the Tribunal derives essential aspects of its authority. And although Spain\u2019s desire to \u201cdefend its interests and those of the underwater heritage,\u201d34 in a way that \u201ccan help \u2026 to the advancement of the common historical knowledge between Spain and Colombia and in the preservation and conservation of property that make up the subaquatic cultural heritage for the benefit of humanity\u201d35 is laudable, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this arbitration is the appropriate forum in which to address Spain\u2019s various claims.\n34. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, if any, arises from and is circumscribed by the TPA. Currently, under the TPA, the Tribunal is mandated to determine solely whether: 36\n(i) Claimant is a protected investor under Art. 10.28 of the TPA;\n(ii) Claimant possesses a qualifying \u201cinvestment\u201d under Art. 10.28 of the TPA;\n(iii) the Tribunal has ratione temporis jurisdiction under Art. 10.1.3 of the TPA; and\n(iv) Claimant\u2019s claims are time-barred by the 3-year limitation provision set forth in Art. 10.18.1 of the TPA.\n34 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b642.\n35 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b643.\n36 The Tribunal is also asked to determine Colombia\u2019s request for security for costs, as well as both Parties\u2019 requests for an award of costs pursuant to Art. 10.20.6 of the TPA.\n35. The Parties are in agreement \u2013 albeit for different reasons \u2013 that Spain is unlikely to provide relevant assistance to the Tribunal at this time, when an award or decision on Respondent\u2019s objections under TPA Art. 10.20.5 is yet to be issued. The Tribunal agrees. Even on its face \u2013 and contrary to Spain\u2019s allegation in this respect37 \u2013 the Application fails to disclose a basis on which Spain could conceivably assist the Tribunal in the determination of those issues.\n36. Lastly, but not least, it is obvious that an intervention by Spain at this time \u2013 after the conclusion of the Hearing on Colombia\u2019s jurisdictional objections, and with the Tribunal decision on those objections due very shortly \u2013 would be highly disruptive of the proceedings, including the Parties\u2019 rights and the Tribunal\u2019s obligations under Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA.\nVI. DECISION\n37. For all of the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal rejects Spain\u2019s Application.\n38. This decision is without prejudice to a potential further application by Spain in the event that the case proceeds to the merits and Spain is able to demonstrate, in accordance with Art. 4(3) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, that it has a significant interest in, and that it would assist the Tribunal in, the determination of a factual or legal issue related specifically to the merits of the dispute under the TPA as pleaded by the Parties.\n[Signatures on the following page]\n37 Spain\u2019s Application, \u00b641.\nplace of arbitration: london, united kingdom date: 30 december 2023\nThe arbitral tribunal:\nMr. Stephen L.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1..\n\nAs explained more fully below, this Decision addresses a raft of jurisdictional objections raised in accordance with a preliminary procedure specifically provided for in Article 10.20.5 of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement of 15 May 2012.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES & THEIR COUNSEL**\n----------------------------------\n\n2..\n\nThe claimant in this arbitration is Sea Search-Armada, LLC., a U.S. registered company,\u00a0incorporated in the State of Delaware, with its business address at 9187 Clairemont Mesa Blvd., Suite 6, #334, San Diego, California, 92123 (\u201c**SSA**\u201d or \u201c**Claimant**\u201d). Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Rahim Moloo, Mr. Robert Weigel, Ms. Anne   \nChampion, Mr. Jason Myatt, Ms. Ankita Ritwik, Ms. Victoria R. Orlowski, Ms. Mar\u00eda L. Banda, Mr. Pablo Garrido and Ms. Martina Monti of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Zapata of Holland & Knight, Colombia.\n\n3..\n\nThe respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Colombia, a sovereign State (the \u201c**Respondent**\u201d or \u201c**Colombia**\u201d). Respondent was represented in these proceedings by Ms. Martha Luc\u00eda Zamora \u00c1vila, Ms. Ana Mar\u00eda Ordo\u00f1ez Puentes, Mr. Giovanny Vega-Barbosa, Mr. Camilo Valdivieso Le\u00f3n, Ms. Manuela Sossa S\u00e1nchez, Ms. Juana Mart\u00ednez Quintero, Ms. Mariana Reyes Munera and Mr. Juan Camilo Mej\u00eda Pinillos of the Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado de Colombia (\u201c**ANDJE**\u201d).\n\n**B. BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n4..\n\nAs more fully explained in this Decision, the arbitration concerns a dispute arising from Respondent\u2019s alleged \u201cunlawful expropriation of and interference with [Claimant\u2019s] rights to approximately USD 10 billion worth of treasure found by [Claimant\u2019s] predecessors over 40 years ago.\u201d1 The treasure, as described by Claimant, was found with the shipwreck of a 300-year old galleon, the San Jos\u00e9, in Colombian waters.\n\nNoA, \u00b63.\n\n5..\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s submission, after the Colombian Supreme Court of Justice (\u201c**CSJ**\u201d or \u201c**Supreme Court**\u201d) confirmed that Claimant had rights to 50% of the treasure it had discovered and reported, the Colombian Ministry of Culture issued Resolution No. 0085, declaring that the entirety of the San Jos\u00e9 was not treasure but an \u201cAsset of National Cultural Interest\u201d and therefore exempt from the CSJ ruling, thus depriving Claimant of its rights to 50% of its discovery.\n\n6..\n\nClaimant argues that, through these actions, Respondent breached Arts. 10.7, 10.5, 10.3 and 10.4 of the United States \u2013 Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement of 15 May 2012 (the \u201c**TPA**\u201d or \u201c**Treaty**\u201d) regarding expropriation and compensation, minimum standard of treatment, national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment. It seeks the restitution of its rights or,\u00a0in the alternative, full compensation for the damages caused in an amount estimated to be USD 10 billion, plus the corresponding interest.\n\n7..\n\nOn 22 July 2023, Respondent submitted several objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA. The Tribunal decides those objections in this Decision.\n\n**C. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**\n--------------------------------\n\n8..\n\nArticle 10.16 of the TPA provides as follows:\n\nArticle 10.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and\n\n(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach,\u00a0provided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(C) or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.\n\nprovided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(C) or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.\n\n2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (\u201cnotice of intent\u201d). The notice shall specify:\n\n(a) the name and address of the claimant and, where a claim is submitted on behalf of an enterprise, the name, address, and place of incorporation of the enterprise;\n\n(b) for each claim, the provision of this Agreement, investment authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;\n\n(c) the legal and factual basis for each claim; and\n\n(d) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.\n\n3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:\n\n(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedures for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party of the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention;\n\n(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the respondent or the Party of the claimant is a party to the ICSID Convention;\n\n(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or\n\n(d) if the claimant and respondent agree, to any other arbitration institution or under any other arbitration rules.\n\n4. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the claimant\u2019s notice of or request for arbitration (\u201cnotice of arbitration\u201d):\n\n(a) referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary-General;\n\n(b) referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General;\n\n(c) referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the respondent; or\u00a0(d) referred to under any arbitral institution or arbitral rules selected under paragraph 3(d) is received by the respondent.\n\nA claim asserted by the claimant for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitral rules.\n\n5. The arbitration rules applicable under paragraph 3, and in effect on the date the claim or claims were submitted to arbitration under this Section, shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Agreement.\n\n6. The claimant shall provide with the notice of arbitration:\n\n(a) the name of the arbitrator that the claimant appoints; or\n\n(b) the claimant\u2019s written consent for the Secretary-General to appoint that arbitrator.\n\n**D.** **APPLICABLE LAW**\n-------------------------\n\n9..\n\nArticle 10.22 of the TPA provides as follows:\n\nArticle 10.22: Governing Law\n\n1. Subject to paragraph 3, when a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(A), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\n\n2. Subject to paragraph 3 and the other terms of this Section, when a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or (C), or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B) or (C), the\u00a0 tribunal shall apply:\n\n(a) the rules of law specified in the pertinent investment authorization or investment agreement, or as the disputing parties may otherwise agree; or\n\n(b) if the rules of law have not been specified or otherwise agreed:\n\n(i) the law of the respondent, including its rules on the conflict of laws, and\n\n(ii) such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n3. A decision of the Commission declaring its interpretation of a provision of this Agreement under Article 20.1.3 (Free Trade Commission) shall be binding on a tribunal, and any decision or award issued by a tribunal must be consistent with that   \ndecision.\n\n**E. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------\n\n10..\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Mr. Stephen Jagusch KC, Dr. Claus Von Wobeser, and Mr. Stephen L. Drymer serving as President of the Tribunal.\n\n11..\n\nClaimant appointed Mr. Stephen Jagusch KC, a national of New Zealand, as a co-arbitrator in its *Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim* dated 18 December 2022. Respondent appointed Dr. Claus Von Wobeser, a national of Mexico and Germany, as a co-arbitrator on   \n14 March 2023. In due accord with the protocol agreed by the Parties for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator, Mr. Stephen L. Drymer, a national of Canada, was appointed, and the Tribunal deemed constituted, on 7 June 2023.\n\n12..\n\nThe appointment of the Tribunal was recorded in the Terms of Appointment dated 22 August 2023 (\u201c**ToA**\u201d), which were drawn up and executed further to a first procedural meeting involving the Parties and the members of the Tribunal on 25 July 2022. Also on 22 August 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\u201c**PO1**\u201d) governing certain procedural elements of the arbitration.\n\n**F. APPLICABLE ARBITRATION RULES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n13..\n\nPursuant to Art. 10.16(3)(c) of the TPA, the arbitration rules applicable to these proceedings are the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as revised in 2021 (the \u201c**UNCITRAL Rules**\u201d).\n\n**G.** **SEAT OF THE ARBITRATION**\n----------------------------------\n\n14..\n\nPursuant to the agreement of the Parties, the legal place (or \u201cseat\u201d) of the arbitration is London, United Kingdom.\n\n**H. LANGUAGE OF THE ARBITRATION**\n----------------------------------\n\n15..\n\nAs set out at paragraph 2 of PO1, the languages of the arbitration are English and Spanish (subject to certain specifics concerning the language of correspondence, Parties\u2019 submissions and documents, as well as oral testimony).\n\n16..\n\nIn accordance with paragraph 2.2.4.1 of PO1, this Decision is issued in English with an accompanying translation into Spanish.

ADMNISTERING INSTITUTION\n---------------------------\n\n18..\n\nAs recorded at paragraph 11.1 of the ToA, by agreement of the Parties, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \u201c**PCA**\u201d) acts as Registry and administers the arbitral proceedings. Mr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Arag\u00f3n Cardiel, PCA Legal Counsel, was designated to act as Registrar and Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\nK. PROCEDURAL CALENDAR\n----------------------\n\n19..\n\nParagraph 3.1 of PO1 reads as follows:\n\nThe procedural calendar is set forth in Annex 1 to this order and is issued after consultation with the Parties. By their respective communications of 8 August 2023 the Parties, having taken note of Article 10.20.5 of the TPA, consented to the procedural calendar, to which they do not and will not object. The Parties hereby agree that they will not seek to challenge the decision on the Respondent\u2019s objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA based solely on the fact that the award might be issued later than 17 February 2024 and agree to waive any challenge on those grounds.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n20..\n\nOn 18 December 2022, Claimant submitted its *Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim*(\u201c**Notice of Arbitration**\u201d or **NoA**\u201d).\n\n21..\n\nOn 18 January 2023, Respondent submitted its *Respuesta a notification de arbitraje* (\u201c**Answer to Notice of Arbitration**\u201d or \u201c**Answer**\u201d).\n\n22..\n\nOn 22 July 2023, Respondent filed a Submission pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the Trade Promotion Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and the United States of America (\u201cArt. 10.20.5 Submission\u201d, or \u201cSubmission\u201d) in which it requested the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) order the suspension of any proceedings on the merits;\n\n(ii) open a jurisdictional phase pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA; and\n\n(iii)set a procedural calendar that allows it to decide the objections to jurisdiction on an expedited basis, and in any case, no later than 180 days after this request.\u201d2\n\nSubmission, \u00b6127. On 26 July 2023, Respondent submitted an amended version of its Submission which contained corrections to various clerical errors in the document initially filed on 22 July. On 1 August 2023, Respondent filed a redacted version of its Jurisdictional Submission (the sole redacted paragraph being paragraph 114).\n\n23..\n\nAs noted above, on 25 July 2023, the first procedural meeting took place, further to which the Tribunal executed the ToA and issued PO1 on 22 August 2023.\n\n24..\n\nOn 21 September 2023, Claimant filed its Response to Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (\u201c**Response to Art. 10.20.5 Submission**\u201d or \u201c**Response**\u201d).\n\n25..\n\nOn the same date, in connection with section 4.4 of the ToA, Claimant confirmed to the Tribunal, through its counsel, that no third party is financing its representation or participation in the arbitration, although its counsel is engaged under a contingency fee arrangement.\u00a0Claimant\u2019s counsel has in place \u201ca general and confidential financing facility agreement with a third party not involved in this proceeding in order to offset contingency fee agreements entered into by the firm.3\n\nEmail from Gibson Dunn to the Tribunal, 21 September 2023 (**R-39**).\n\n26..\n\nOn 5 October 2023, in relation to Claimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s email,4 Respondent requested, through its counsel, that the Tribunal, make the following rulings: (i) \u201ctake note that there is a third-party financing [Claimant]\u2019s representation in these proceedings;\u201d (ii) \u201cdraw the appropriate consequences form Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with Section 4.4. of the [ToA];\u201d (iii) \u201corder Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to disclose the terms of the financing agreement and the identity of the third party involved in such agreement,\u201d or alternatively \u201cto order Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to inform whether the financing agreement includes the funder\u2019s obligation to cover a potential adverse decision on costs\u201d to Claimant.5\n\nEmail from Gibson Dunn to the Tribunal, 21 September 2023 (**R-39**).\n\nEmail from the ANDJE to the Tribunal, 5 October 2023 (**R-41**).\n\n27..\n\nOn 9 October 2023, Claimant opposed Respondent\u2019s requests of 5 October 2023.6\n\nEmail from Gibson Dunn to the Tribunal, 9 October 2023 (**R-40**).\n\n28..\n\nOn 11 October 2023, the Tribunal denied Respondent\u2019s requests of 5 October 2023.\n\n29..\n\nOn 20 October 2023, Respondent filed Colombia\u2019s Reply to Claimant\u2019s Response to Colombia\u2019s Submission pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the Trade Promotion Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and the United States of America (\u201c**Reply**\u201d).\n\n30..\n\nOn 19 November 2023, Claimant filed its Rejoinder to Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (\u201c**Rejoinder**\u201d).\n\n31..\n\nOn 6 December 2023, the Tribunal convened the Parties to a pre hearing conference.\n\n32..\n\nOn 8 December 2023, the United States of America filed a non-disputing party submission pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA entitled *Submission of the United States of America* (the \u201c**U.S. Submission**\u201d).\n\n33..\n\nOn 14 and 15 December 2023, the hearing concerning Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections took place in Bogota, Colombia (the \u201cHearing\u201d). A public webcast of the Hearing was made available on the PCA\u2019s website. The following persons attended the Hearing:\n\n**The Tribunal:**\n\nMr. Stephen L. Drymer (Presiding Arbitrator)  \nMr. Stephen Jagusch KC  \nDr. Claus Von Wobeser\n\n**Assistant to the Tribunal:**\n\nMs. Dina Proki\u0107\n\n**For Claimant**\n\nMr. Rahim Moloo  \nMs. Ankita Ritwik  \nMr. Mark Regn  \nMs. Kathleen Regn  \nMr. Robert L. Weigel   \nMr. Pablo Garrido  \nMs. Martina Monti  \nMr. Jos\u00e9 Zapata  \nMr. Steven Perles\n\n**For Respondent**\n\nMs. Martha Luc\u00eda Zamora \u00c1vila  \nMs. Ana Mar\u00eda Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Puentes  \nMr. Giovanny Vega-Barbosa  \nMr. Camilo Valdivieso  \nMs. Juana Mart\u00ednez  \nMs. Manuela Sossa  \nMs. Mariana Reyes  \nMr. Juan Camilo Mej\u00eda  \nMs. Jennyfer D\u00edaz Ram\u00edrez  \nMr. Leiver Palacios  \nMr. Herm\u00e1nn Le\u00f3n  \nMr. William Pedroza\n\n**For the United States of America**\n\nMr. David M. Bigge (remotely)\n\n**For the PCA**\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Arag\u00f3n Cardiel   \nMs. Ji Soo Kim (remotely)  \nMs. Magdalena Legris (remotely)\n\n**Interpreters**\n\nMs. Silvia Colla  \nMr. Daniel Giglio\n\n**Court Reporters**  \nMs. Marjorie R. Dauster  \nMr. Virgilio Dante Rinaldi\n\n**IT/AV**  \nMr. Nicholas Wilson\n\n34..\n\nAlso on 15 December 2023, the Kingdom of Spain filed the Application for leave to intervene as non-disputing party in the resubmission proceeding (\u201c**Spain\u2019s Intervention Application**\u201d).\n\n35..\n\nOn 22 December 2023, at the Tribunal\u2019s request, the Parties\u2019 provided their observations on Spain\u2019s Intervention Application.\n\n36..\n\nOn 30 December 2023, the Tribunal dismissed Spain\u2019s Intervention Application by way of a\u00a0*Decision on the Application by the Kingdom of Spain for Leave to Intervene as Non-disputing Party* (\u201c**Decision on Spain\u2019s Intervention Application**\u201d). Spain\u2019s Intervention Application was rejected on the following grounds:\n\nAs stated in Art. 4(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, a \u201cthird person\u201d such as Spain \u2013 that is, a person that is neither \u201ca disputing party\u201d (in this case, SSA and Colombia) nor \u201ca non-disputing Party to the Treaty\u201d (here, the United States, which indeed filed a Non-Disputing Party submission) \u2013 must identify   \n\u201cspecific issues of fact or law in the arbitration that the third person wishes to address in its written submission.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s Application does not do that. Instead, it focuses on the argument that the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 is Spain\u2019s property, which is not an issue in the arbitration.   \nAs both of the disputing parties have indicated numerous times in their written and oral pleadings, and as the Tribunal itself is cognizant, for the time being the entire question of ownership of the San Jos\u00e9 or its treasure \u2013 even as between SSA and Colombia \u2013 is not an issue to be determined by the Tribunal; and the question may never become such an issue if Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional plea is accepted.\n\nSpain may well have an \u201cinterest \u2026 in the arbitration\u201d (Art. 4(2)(d) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules), perhaps even a \u201csignificant interest in the arbitral proceedings\u201d (Art. 4(3)(a)). The Tribunal makes no findings in this regard, although it does of course take Spain\u2019s allegations in this respect into consideration. Yet even if these allegations are assumed to be correct, it would still be an insufficient basis on which to grant Spain\u2019s requests, in view of the   \nsecond limb of Art. 4(3) which requires the Tribunal to consider:\n\n\u201c(b) The extent to which the submission [from a third person] would assist the arbitral tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to thearbitral proceedings by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight   \nthat is different from that of the disputing parties.\u201d\n\nThroughout its Application, Spain asserts that there exists a legal dispute between itself and Colombia over the ownership of Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9. It provides no support whatsoever for this assertion, nor any specific information regarding the alleged basis, commencement, stage, status, forum or other particulars of   \nany such dispute. The Tribunal is compelled to note (not that this point is in any way determinative) that this is the first and only time that it has heard of such \u201cdispute\u201d in these proceedings. Colombia itself says nothing in this regard in its Observations. Be that as it may, such a dispute could not arise under the TPA, from which the Tribunal derives essential aspects of its authority. And although   \nSpain\u2019s desire to \u201cdefend its interests and those of the underwater heritage,\u201d in a way that \u201ccan help \u2026 to the advancement of the common historical knowledge between Spain and Colombia and in the preservation and conservation of property that make up the subaquatic cultural heritage for the benefit of humanity\u201d is laudable, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this arbitration is the appropriate forum in which to address Spain\u2019s various claims.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, if any, arises from and is circumscribed by the TPA. Currently, under the TPA, the Tribunal is mandated to determine solely whether:\n\n(i) Claimant is a protected investor under Art. 10.28 of the TPA;\n\n(ii) Claimant possesses a qualifying \u201cinvestment\u201d under Art. 10.28 of the TPA;\n\n(iii) the Tribunal has ratione temporis jurisdiction under Art. 10.1.3 of the TPA; and\n\n(iv) Claimant\u2019s claims are time-barred by the 3-year limitation provision set forth in Art. 10.18.1 of the TPA.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement \u2013 albeit for different reasons \u2013 that Spain is unlikely to provide relevant assistance to the Tribunal at this time, when an award or decision on Respondent\u2019s objections under TPA Art. 10.20.5 is yet to be issued.   \nThe Tribunal agrees. Even on its face \u2013 and contrary to Spain\u2019s allegation in this respect \u2013 the Application fails to disclose a basis on which Spain could conceivably assist the Tribunal in the determination of those issues.\n\nLastly, but not least, it is obvious that an intervention by Spain at this time \u2013 after the conclusion of the Hearing on Colombia\u2019s jurisdictional objections, and with the Tribunal decision on those objections due very shortly \u2013 would be highly disruptive of the proceedings, including the Parties\u2019 rights and the Tribunal\u2019s obligations under Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA.\n\n37..\n\nOn 22 January 2024, Mr. Isidoro Rodr\u00edguez, a third party individual purporting to be \u201cthe Legal Representative from 1988 to the present of Sea Search-Armada and Armada Company LLP\u201d submitted a Motion to Testify and Intervene (\u201c**Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request**\u201d).\n\n38..\n\nThe Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their comments on Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request, which were filed on 25 January 2024.\n\n39..\n\nOn 31 January 2024, the Tribunal rejected Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request on the following grounds:\n\nMr. Rodr\u00edguez seeks leave to \u201ctestify and intervene\u201d in these proceedings inter alia on the following grounds:\n\n*This motion to testify and intervene is filed pursuant to the authority and**fiduciary duties of Witness Isidoro Rodriguez as the Legal Representative**from 1988 to the present of Sea Search-Armada and Armada Company LLP*   \n*\u2026 in the Republic of Colombia.*\n\n*The motion is filed based on the record evidence of ongoing acts of fraud**against the Republic of Colombia (Respondent) in violation of the Colombian**Commercial Code and a business conspiracy since 1992 failure to not pay*   \n*wages to its Legal Representative ... There was not and could not have been**any Board of Directors of a dissolved entity to either revoke Isidoro**Rodriguez\u2019s Power of Attorney in Colombia, or to transfer property and**contract rights with the authorization of DIMAR in accordance with the**Commercial Code Art. 495.*\n\n*In sum, Claimant co-conspirator Jack Harbeston and Claimant Sea Search**Armada L.L.C (California entity) have filed void ab initio false claims**(Claimant\u2019s Exhibits) to the rights of Sea Search-Armada and Armada**Company LLP \u2026 that had been dissolved in 2002 (Exhibit 3).*\n\nMr. Rodr\u00edguez also notes that his Request is filed in support of Respondent\u2019s   \nchallenge to the standing of Claimant in this proceeding:\n\nTherefore, motion is filed in support Respondent\u2019s challenges as to the standing of Sea Search-Armada, LLC (\u201cClaimant\u201d), and jurisdiction of this proceeding, because 23 years after the unlawful dissolving of Cayman Island Entities in 2002 (Exhibit 2) the Claimant was established in California to fraudulently obfuscate its identity.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, he also \u201ccontrols\u201d any property rights that were held by Claimant prior to its purported dissolution:\n\nThe Cayman Island LLP was unlawfully dissolved, and control of its property rights were transferred to Isidoro Rodriguez as Legal Representative.\n\nHaving taken note of Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s assertions and the Parties\u2019 observations thereon, the Tribunal must reject Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls that there is no procedural basis in the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (\u201cTPA\u201d), the UNCITRAL Rules or the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules for a third-party private individual to assert a right to \u201ctestify and intervene\u201d in this investor-State arbitration.\n\nSecond, to the extent that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez could be understood to be seeking leave to intervene as an amicus curiae under the TPA, the Tribunal considers that he is ill-suited to perform the role of a \u2018friend of the court\u2019. It appears to the Tribunal that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request, reduced to its essence, is ultimately made in furtherance of his \u2013 purported \u2013 private rights: he refers to a \u201cfailure to not pay wages [sic]\u201d and also purports to have \u201ccontrol of [the] property rights\u201d of Claimant. That Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s Request is made in strict furtherance of his personal interests is also confirmed by the fact that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the Claimant and its Predecessors have been engaged in a decades-long litigation before U.S. courts concerning largely the same facts in respect of which Mr. Rodr\u00edguez seeks to \u201ctestify and intervene\u201d in this arbitration. The Tribunal cannot allow an amicus curiae submission (even if, for the sake of argument, that were how Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s request to \u201ctestify and intervene\u201d were understood) to be used as a vehicle for the pursuit of the interests of private third-party litigants against the disputing Parties in this investor-State arbitration.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request. While the record would support other grounds for the rejection of Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s Request, the Tribunal declines to address them for reasons of arbitral economy.\n\nIII. KEY FACTS\n--------------\n\n40..\n\nAs advanced above, although the immediate question at issue is the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the merits of the underlying dispute concern the discovery of a long-sought 18th century treasure: the shipwreck of the famed Spanish galleon, the San Jos\u00e9 (or, Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9). SSA claims that one of its predecessors-in-interest discovered the shipwreck off the coast of Colombia in the 1980s, entitling it under prevailing Colombian law to 50% of the value of the treasure; an entitlement, it says, Colombia purported to eviscerate in 2020 when it declared the Gal\u00e9on San Jos\u00e9 and its contents \u2013 still strewn across the ocean floor \u2013 an \u201casset of national cultural interest\u201d.7 For its part, Colombia not only contests SSA\u2019s entitlement to any share of the treasure, but also disputes that Claimant\u2019s predecessor actually discovered the San Jos\u00e9.8\n\nNoA, \u00b63, 7; Response, \u00b62.\n\nSubmission, \u00b630, 151-157, 178; Reply, \u00b63-5; Rejoinder, \u00b638.\n\n41..\n\nNonetheless, certain facts are not in dispute. Events have undeniably taken place, agreements have been entered into, discussions and communications between the Parties and others have occurred, statements have been made, judgments have been issued. A number of such facts are described in this section. It is noted that the descriptions here are drawn to a large extent from the extensive and exceptionally helpful Joint Chronology of Key Facts developed by the Parties and submitted to the Tribunal on 11 December 2023 (\u201c**Joint Chronology**\u201d).\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS AND ITS PREDECESSORS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n42..\n\nOn 29 January 1980 a Delaware company named Glocca Morra Company Inc. (\u201c**GMC Inc.**\u201d) obtained an underwater exploration permit issued by Colombia\u2019s General Directorate of the Maritime and Port Authority (*Direcci\u00f3n General Mar\u00edtima y Portuaria*, \u201c**DIMAR**\u201d)  \n**Resolution No. 0048**.9 The scope of this permit, which is discussed in greater detail below, is disputed between the Parties.\n\n9 Response, \u00b622-23; Answer, \u00b614; Rejoinder, \u00b637.\n\n43..\n\nLater that year the founders of GMC Inc. incorporated a Cayman Islands company, Glocca Morra Company Limited Partnership (\u201c**GMC**\u201d) to which GMC Inc. assigned its interests under Resolution No. 0048, which transfer was authorized by DIMAR by virtue of Resolution No. 753 of 13 October 1980.10\n\nAnswer, \u00b616; Submission, \u00b623; Response, \u00b631; Joint Chronology, p. 2 (item 6).\n\n44..\n\nIn 1983, GMC transferred its rights in the permit to its parent company, SSA Cayman, whose limited partners included Armada Partners (a U.S. company), San Joseph Partners (a U.S. company), Royal Capitana Partners (a Cayman Islands company), Sea Search Joint Venture (a Cayman Islands company), and Armada Company (a Cayman Islands company) (together \u201c**SSA Partners**\u201d), in accordance with DIMAR\u2019s Resolution No. 204 of 24 March 1983.11\n\nSubmission, \u00b633; Response, \u00b651; Joint Chronology, p. 5 (item 17).\n\n45..\n\nAccording to Claimant, on 18 November 2008, SSA Cayman transferred its assets and liabilities to Claimant, SSA, a U.S. registered company, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (\u201c**APA**\u201d).12\n\nSubmission, \u00b669; Response, \u00b696; Rejoinder, \u00b694; Joint Chronology, p. 13 (item 44).\n\n46..\n\nGMC Inc., GMC and SSA Cayman are collectively referred to as the \u201c**SSA Predecessors**\u201d.13\n\nResponse, \u00b62.\n\n**B. THE GALEON SAN JOSE AND ITS DISCOVERY(IES)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n47..\n\nThe Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 has been lying on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea since it sank on 8 June 1708 in the midst of a naval battle between Spain and Britain, taking with it most of its crew, passengers and, in Respondent\u2019s words \u201cthe biggest treasure in the history of humanity,\u201d14 or, in Claimant\u2019s words, \u201cthe most valuable cargo ever shipped from the New World, estimated to include over 7 million pesos, 116 steel chests full of emeralds, and 30 million gold coins\u201d (currently estimated at approximately USD 20 billion).15 The history of the San Jos\u00e9 and its substantial value (whatever the precise figure may be) are not disputed.\n\nSubmission, \u00b62.\n\nNoA, \u00b614; Response, \u00b615; Rejoinder, \u00b624, 27.\n\n48..\n\nThe discory of Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 and its location, however, are controversial.\n\n49..\n\nAccording to Claimant, after a two-year search costing many millions of dollars, GMC submitted to Colombia a \u201c*Confidential Report on the Underwater Exploration by Glocca Morra Company in the Caribbean Sea, Colombia\u201d* dated 26 February 1982 (the \u201c**1982 Report**\u201d), reporting the discovery of what it claims was the San Jos\u00e9. 16 This was followed by a confirmation by Oceaneering International, Inc., a specialized subsea engineering firm which SSA Cayman had hired to \u201cprovide positioning to aid in the recovery\u201d of the reported target.17\n\nAnswer, \u00b618; Submission, \u00b626; Response, \u00b641.\n\nResponse, \u00b653; Rejoinder, \u00b646.\n\n50..\n\nAccording to Respondent, there is no conclusive evidence that SSA\u2019s Predecessor(s) in fact found the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.18 The 1982 Report did not mention the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 and GMC never supplemented it to expressly note that it had found the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.19 Rather, the 1982 Report merely noted the possible existence of a shipwreck that could date from the colonial period. 20 Respondent alleges that an independent study conducted in 1994 by Columbus Exploration Inc. (\u201c**Columbus**\u201d), which was hired \u201cfor the purpose of developing an oceanographic investigation to test the Hypothesis of the discovery of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in the area reported in the 1982 Confidential Report,\u201d21 concluded that the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 was\u00a0not in the area reported by GMC.22 This conclusion was accepted by Colombia and published in a press release dated 7 July 1994 (\u201c**1994 Press Release**\u201d).23\n\n8 Submission, \u00b630.\n\nSubmission, \u00b627; Reply, \u00b632, 34, 36, 41.\n\nAnswer, \u00b619.\n\nReply, \u00b664, 65.\n\nSubmission, \u00b657-62.

ATTEMPTS TO SALVAGE THE GALEON SAN JOSE**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n52..\n\nAccording to Claimant: \u201cOn 12 March 1982, GMC sent a letter to DIMAR with potential terms for a salvage contract for the San Jos\u00e9. [\u2026].\u201d25 According to Respondent, this letter simply contains a recount of the facts, without providing evidence of the alleged discovery of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.26\n\nResponse, \u00b645; Rejoinder, \u00b658.\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 4 (item 12).\n\n53..\n\nOn 23 August 1984, DIMAR sent a letter to SSA Cayman announcing that it was attaching a \u201cDraft Contract for the Archaeological Study and Salvage of Shipwrecked Goods.\u201d27\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 6 (item 23).\n\n54..\n\nOn 2 November 1984, DIMAR sent SSA Cayman a letter. According to Claimant, the letter referred to a potential salvage contract for the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck, offering to divide the salvaged goods on a sliding scale. 28 According to Respondent, the letter clarified that the company only held the privileges granted by law to a reporter of a treasure; informed the company that it was just another bidder in the process; and informed the company that any contract was just a \u201cpossibility.\u201d29\n\nResponse, \u00b660; Reply, \u00b660; Joint Chronology, p. 7 (item 25).\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 7 (item 25).\n\n55..\n\nOn 9 November 1984, SSA Cayman sent DIMAR a letter.

Colombia, however, began courting various States, including the U.S., Sweden, Brazil, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Norway and Japan, to conclude a Government-to-Government contract to \u201csearch for and recover the\u00a0Spanish treasureship [sic] \u2018San Jos\u00e9\u2019.\u201d 31 On 17 July 1988, Colombia entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Swedish Government.32\n\nResponse, \u00b665.

GOUVERNMENTAL DECREES AND RESOLUTIONS\n----------------------------------------\n\n59..\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first resolution relevant to this dispute, by which DIMAR granted GMC Inc.\u2019s request for an underwater exploration permit to search for shipwrecks within a specified area of Colombia waters, was Resolution No. 0048 of 29 January 1980.35 While Claimant argues that Resolution No. 0048 made clear that the exploration permit was issued for the purpose of finding the San Jos\u00e9, 36 Respondent contends that, given GMC Inc.\u2019s expressed purpose of the request (\u201cto seek for the existence of shipwrecked species, treasures, or any other elements of historic, scientific, or commercial value\u201d)37 the resolution was simply authorizing GMC Inc. to \u201ccarry out underwater explorations in specific areas \u2013 delineated by specific coordinates \u2013 of the Colombian sea for a period of two years.\u201d38 Resolution No. 0048 was subsequently extended on 29 January 1982 for three months by virtue of **Resolution No. 0025**39 and on 22 April 1982 for an additional 3 months by virtue of **Resolution No. 249**40.\n\nResponse, \u00b622-23; Submission, \u00b621-22; Rejoinder, \u00b630; Joint Chronology, p. 2 (item 4).\n\nResponse, \u00b623; Rejoinder, \u00b631-32.\n\nSubmission, \u00b621.\n\nSubmission, \u00b622.\n\nSubmission, \u00b625; Response, \u00b640; Joint Chronology, p. 3 (item 9).\n\nSubmission, \u00b628; Response, \u00b640; Joint Chronology, p. 4 (item 14).\n\n60..\n\nOn 13 October 1980, upon request by GMC Inc., DIMAR issued **Resolution No. 753**, authorizing GMC Inc. to transfer the rights previously granted by Resolution No. 0048 of 1980 to Glocca Morra Company.41\n\nSubmission, \u00b623; Response, \u00b631; Joint Chronology, p. 2 (item 6).\n\n61..\n\nOn 4 February 1981, upon request by GMC, DIMAR issued **Resolution No. 066**, increasing the exploration areas granted to GMC Inc. in Resolution No. 0048 of 29 January 1980.42\n\nAnswer, \u00b617; Submission, \u00b624; Response, \u00b632; Joint Chronology, p. 2 (item 7).\n\n62..\n\nOn 3 June 1982, through Resolution No. 0354, DIMAR recognized GMC as a \u201creporter of treasures or shipwrecked species in the coordinates referred to in the \u2018Confidential Report on the Underwater Exploration carried out by Glocca Morra Company in the Caribbean Sea, Colombia 26 February 1982\u2019.\u201d43 According to Claimant, this resolution fully integrated the 1982 Report and gave GMC rights to the Discovery Area as defined in the 1982 Report (the \u201c**Discovery Area**\u201d)44.According to Respondent, the fact that \u201cResolution No. 0354 simply recognized Glocca Mora Company as a reporter of treasures or shipwrecked species, without even mentioning the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9\u201d supports the proposition that Resolution No. 0048 never authorized Claimant to search for the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 specifically.45\n\nAnswer, \u00b620; Submission, \u00b631; Response, \u00b646; Joint Chronology, p. 4 (item 15).\n\nResponse, \u00b649.\n\nReply, \u00b627.\n\n63..\n\nOn 24 March 1983, DIMAR recognized the transfer of GMC\u2019s rights to SSA Cayman and authorized it \u201cto conduct exploration work approved for the assignor\u201d in prior DIMAR resolutions (i.e. Nos. 0048, 0066, 0025, 0249 and 0354) by virtue of **Resolution No. 204**.46\n\nSubmission, \u00b633; Response, \u00b652; Joint Chronology, p. 5 (item 17).\n\n64..\n\nOn 10 January 1984, the President of Colombia issued Decree No. 12,  \n47 and on 18 September 1984 - Decree No. 2324.48 In Claimant\u2019s view, these two decrees: \u201c(i) reduced the percentage share of treasure that the finder of a shipwreck would receive from 50% of the treasure itself to 5% of the gross value of whatever was salvaged; and (ii) eliminated any preferential rights to a salvage contract to the declarants of a treasure.\u201d49 Conversely, Respondent notes Presidential Decree No. 2324 \u201creaffirmed DIMAR\u2019s authority to grant exploration permits, receive reports of findings and decide upon them. It also provided DIMAR\u2019s authority to carry out the necessary steps for entering into and perfecting salvage contracts.\u201d50\n\nSubmission, \u00b634-40; Response, \u00b663; Joint Chronology, p. 6 (item 20).\n\nSubmission, \u00b642-47; Response, \u00b663; Joint Chronology, p. 7 (item 24).\n\nResponse, \u00b663.\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 7 (item 24).\n\n65..\n\nOn 24 July 2002, Decree No. 1561 was issued regarding DIMAR\u2019s authority.51\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 12 (item 41); Decree No. 1561 of 2002, 24 July 2002 (**R-14**).\n\n66..\n\nOn 30 December 2009, Decree No. 5057 was issued regarding DIMAR\u2019s authority.52\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 14 (item 48); Decree No. 5057 of 2009, 30 December 2009 (R-16).\n\n67..\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Ministry of Culture issued Resolution No. 0085, which \u201c[d]eclare[d] the Shipwreck of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 an Asset of National Cultural Interest.\u201d53\n\nAnswer, \u00b634; Submission, \u00b6113; Response, \u00b6135-141; Reply, \u00b6155.\n\nE. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n--------------------\n\n68..\n\nClaims to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 have given rise to legal proceedings in three different fora prior to this arbitration: the courts of Colombia; the United States Federal Court; and the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights. These proceedings featured prominently in the  \nParties\u2019 pleadings.\n\n1) Litigation in Colombia\n-------------------------\n\n69..\n\nOver the course of three decades, multiple levels of Colombian courts have dealt with lawsuits brought by SSA\u2019s Predecessors.\n\n70..\n\nOn 13 January 1989, SSA Cayman filed a lawsuit (\u201c**Civil Court Action**\u201d) before the 10th Civil Court of Barranquilla Circuit (the \u201c**Civil Court**\u201d).  \n54 In these proceedings Claimant asked the Civil Court to confirm the following:\n\nAs GMC had been recognized by DIMAR\u2019s Resolution No. 0354 as the reporter of treasure, Colombia had no rights over any of the goods of economic, historical, cultural or scientific value that qualified as treasures and were found in the Colombian continental platform or in Colombia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, within the  \ncoordinates and surrounding areas referred to in the 1982 Report;  \nIn the alternative, and if the Civil Court concluded that the goods were not located in the Colombian continental shelf or in Colombia\u2019s exclusive economic zone but instead were located in Colombia\u2019s territorial sea, then SSA Cayman had rights over  \n50% of the treasure while Colombia had rights over the remaining 50%;

Rather, Claimant asks that the Tribunal \u201creject Colombia\u2019s objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA [\u2026]\u201d This was further confirmed  \nat the Hearing:\n\nARBITRATOR JAGUSCH: [\u2026] My understanding is that there is an application before us [Respondent\u2019s Art. 10.20.5 application] to accept or to reject. Accepting it would effectively terminate the proceedings because we would find that we lack jurisdiction. But what would \u201crejecting it\u201d mean? Would it mean that jurisdiction  \nobjections may still be pursued subsequently? And the reason I raise this is it ties in with my discussion with Mr. Moloo earlier where I asked what your primary relief was. And you said our primary relief was that you thought that we would issue a  \ndecision or an award as appropriate, now finding that we do have jurisdiction. So, you can see how that\u2019s a related issue. But also tied up with that is that\u2019s not actually your pleaded position. So, (a), it\u2019s not the relief you formally sought. And (b), I query whether you have the power or whether we would have the power, in any event, to give an affirmative ruling on jurisdiction at this stage. [\u2026]\n\nMR. MOLOO: [\u2026] I guess that will depend on Colombia\u2019s answer to my \u2013 of course, I\u2019m not permitted to ask them questions in this proceeding. But to the extent that they\u00a0have not \u2013 that they do not intend to raise \u2013 or reserve the right to raise additional jurisdictional objections, then I would submit the Tribunal could find \u2013 make an  \naffirmative finding of jurisdiction. But it is correct to [deny] the objections.\n\nARBITRATOR JAGUSCH: You say \u201ccould\u201d. I presume you mean \u201ccould\u201d in the sense that we have available to us what we need to do it.\n\nMR. MOLOO: yes.\n\nARBITRATOR JAGUSCH: How about the procedural regularity of us making an affirmative finding of jurisdiction when that is not the application before us, and nor sensibly construed is your reply. Nor can that be construed as a request for an affirmative ruling on jurisdiction.\n\nMR. MOLOO: No. and that\u2019s why I \u2013 it would require Colombia to accept that they do not have other jurisdictional objections and do not intend to make any. But I think that it is a point well taken that the primary relief side, as it currently stands, is denial \u2013 definitive denial of the objections. [\u2026] It is true that our request for relief is to reject the objections that are raised. I suppose we would defer the question if additional jurisdictional objections were raised at some later stage what our position would be with respect to those. But I think for present purposes, it would probably suffice \u2013 I\u2019m  \ntrying to assist the Tribunal here, with my answer at least \u2013 to reject the objections that are raised by the Respondent. [\u2026] I reserve our position with respect to their ability to raise additional jurisdictional objections under the rules.\n\n96..\n\nIn deciding the issues before it, the Tribunal has carefully considered all of the arguments and evidence submitted by the Parties. The Tribunal has also considered the extensive legal authorities submitted by the Parties, even as, like many arbitral tribunals before it, 91 it recognises that it is not bound by awards rendered in other arbitrations.\n\n*See, e.g*., Jan Oostergetel et al. v.

Whenever the jurisdictional determination is made, the Claimant bears the burden to prove the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction, whether that jurisdictional determination is now, in accordance with Article 10.20.5, or later on the basis of a deferral for  \nthe merits.\u201d).\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b64.\n\n108..\n\nAs such, \u201cthe burden is on the claimant to prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish that a tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its claim\u201d at the jurisdictional stage.109\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b63; Tr.

The Tribunal may not presume Claimant\u2019s allegations to be true for the purposes of deciding the jurisdictional objections. Rather, the Claimant bears the burden of demonstrating any facts necessary to establish jurisdiction at this phase. And these facts must be proven for the Tribunal to find that it has jurisdiction even if those facts also relate to the merits of the claim.\u201d).\n\n**4) Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**(a) Observations on Decision-making under Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109..\n\nGiven the extent of the Parties\u2019 pleadings on numerous issues of fact \u2013 issues that seemingly cover the gamut of questions related to the merits of SSA\u2019s claims, including whether SSA\u2019s predecessors discovered the wreck of the San Jos\u00e9 and its treasure; whether that discovery  \nwas reported to the Colombian authorities and recognised by them; whether on the contrary the wreck was in fact discovered by Colombia itself; and the location of the wreck and treasure \u2013 the Tribunal considers it useful to address briefly the approach to be taken in addressing such questions, it being noted that this Decision is the culmination not of a bifurcated jurisdictional phase in the sense typically known to investment tribunals but of a fairly *sui*generis proceeding under the TPA (as well as under other treaties incorporating the same expedited preliminary procedure)\n\n110..\n\nIn their written pleadings the Parties appeared to disagree on the nature, extent and exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s decision-making authority under Art. 10.20.5 TPA \u2013 specifically, the extent to\u00a0which the Tribunal must determine definitively the numerous disputed facts addressed by the Parties during the preliminary/jurisdictional stage of proceedings, and on what basis; and whether the Tribunal has the discretion generally enjoyed by arbitral tribunals to join certain jurisdictional objections to the merits.\n\n111..\n\nAt the Hearing, the Parties appeared to converge on the approach articulated in *Bridgestone Licensing Services, Inc. et al. v. Republic of Panama*, with Colombia itself highlighting paragraph 118 of that award, which reads:\n\nWhere an objection as to competence raises issues of fact that will not fall for determination at the hearing of the merits, the Tribunal must definitively determine those issues on the evidence and give a final decision on jurisdiction.\n\n112..\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that it is only issues of fact \u201cthat will not fall for determination at the hearing of the merits\u201d that might properly be determined at the jurisdictional stage. However, not every issue of fact that is independent of the merits requires determination when deciding the question of jurisdiction, but only *those factual issues that need to be determined in order to decide the question.*\n\n113..\n\nImportantly, the Parties agree that by virtue of the interaction between Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA and Art. 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has discretion either to decide Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections now or join them to the merits. In Respondent\u2019s view, this discretion  \nmay be exercised only in respect of the factual issues that are intertwined with the merits, whereas questions of fact that are not intertwined with the merits and that concern the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction ought to be decided at this stage on the basis of the factual record as it  \ncurrently stands.110 Claimant, however, disagrees with Respondent\u2019s proposition. In Claimant\u2019s view, if the Tribunal considers that it would benefit from further evidence regarding facts that it deems necessary to determine for purposes of deciding jurisdiction, it should either give the  \nParties an opportunity to present such evidence now, or defer its determination to the merits phase.111 Both Parties consider, however \u2013 indeed they repeatedly insisted \u2013 that the Tribunal\u00a0has all relevant information before it to rule finally on Colombia\u2019s jurisdictional objections at this juncture.112\n\nTr. Day 2, 468: 15-25, 469: 19-25, 470: 1 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: We do submit that you have discretion in deciding. What we submit is that if you were to consider that the relevant facts for deciding on the particular preliminary objections that we are submitting are enough, you should decide the preliminary objections now. But as we said on the very first day, your discretion includes the possibility to, for example, join this question with the merits. Decide it now. [\u2026] Based on the explanation of the relationship between Article 10.20.5 and the relationship with Article 21 of the 2021 UNCITRAL Rules and the principle of the burden of proof, is that if you consider that Claimant has failed to provide you with the relevant facts that are necessary to establish jurisdiction, you should decide now that you don\u2019t have jurisdiction.\u201d).\n\nTr. Day 2, 470: 6-19, 471: 3-10 (\u201cMr. Moloo: If I\u2019m understanding the Tribunal\u2019s questions correctly, if there is a jurisdictional fact that the Tribunal needs to determine \u2013 feels it needs to determine now and it does not have sufficient evidence, I think it has discretion, of course, to ask the Parties to answer any questions that they have in my submission. And if the Tribunal had such a question that it would be appropriate to give the Parties an opportunity to respond to any question the Tribunal has with respect to any such evidence.  \nPresident Drymer: In other words, file or submit further evidence in the course of this expedited preliminary phase?  \nMr. Moloo: yes. [\u2026] I think the Tribunal has discretion with respect to both of them. One of them is if the Tribunal decides that it wants to make a determination now on this expedited basis but feels it has a particular question or needs particular\u00a0information from one of the Parties, then it has the discretion to ask for that during this phase. It also has the discretion to kick that issue to the next phase.\u201d).\n\nTr. Day 1, 185: 6-8 (\u201cMr. Moloo: However, I can say with confidence that you can definitively determine any purely jurisdictional fact, purely jurisdictional fact at this stage.\u201d); Tr. Day 2, 331: 6-12 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: Yesterday, in response to Mr. Drymer\u2019s question, we expressed the view that although the Tribunal\u2019s discretion can be exercised, for example, by deciding the preliminary objections at this juncture, or by deciding to join the analysis with the merits, our view was that the Tribunal had everything at its disposal to dismiss the case at this jurisdictional stage.\u201d), 408: 14-25 and 409: 1-5 (\u201cMr. Moloo: But my submission to you is that all of these are capable of being decided now.\n\n114..\n\nIn performing the exercise which it is called to complete under Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA, the Tribunal will address (i) whether Claimant\u2019s factual allegations are to be assumed as true; (ii) which Party bears the burden of proof at this preliminary stage; and (iii) whether the Tribunal  \nmay defer the resolution of certain issues to the merits stage, if it considers that further evidence is required to determine those issues.\n\n115..\n\nWith respect to, first, item (i) in the preceding paragraph, though both Arts. 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the TPA mandate that the Tribunal decide objections in expedited fashion, 113 only Art. 10.20.4 of the TPA expressly requires the Tribunal to \u201cassume to be true claimant\u2019s factual  \nallegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim,\u201d114 as rightly noted by Respondent115 and the Non-disputing party.116 Considering that Respondent\u2019s objections go to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and are brought under Art. 10.20.5 of the TPA, the presumption in Art. 10.20.4(c) does not apply in the present case. In any event, there is no need for the Tribunal to ascertain whether a prima facie/pro tem factual test applies outside of\u00a0he test mandated under Art. 10.20.4(c) of the TPA: as explained below, the Tribunal\u2019s findings are made on a *prima facie* basis.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

In other words, it is for Claimant to prove the facts supporting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case.118 More generally outside the realm of factual determinations, however, the burden of persuading the Tribunal to grant the jurisdictional objections at issue in this case lies with Respondent as the Party making those objections. Indeed, the tribunal in Pac Rim, when deciding on objections under Arts. 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA (which are substantively identical to Arts. 10.20.4 and 10.20.5  \nof the TPA), held that \u201cit is of course for the Respondent to discharge the burden of satisfying the Tribunal that it should make a final decision dismissing the relevant claim or claims pleaded by the Claimant in these arbitration proceedings.\u201d119 The Tribunal sees no reason why the  \nsame should not be true in this case, nor has Colombia attempted to show how or why that statement might be incorrect or inapplicable.\n\n*Jin Hae Seo v.

Republic of Panama, 120 as it provides the most comprehensive framework:\n\n118. Where an objection as to competence raises issues of fact that will not fall for determination at the hearing of the merits, the Tribunal must definitively determine those issues on the evidence and give a final decision on jurisdiction. This is the position as far as Objection No. 3 asserting a denial of benefits is concerned.\n\n119. Where an objection as to competence raises issues of fact that will fall for determination at the merits stage, the usual course is to postpone the final determination of those issues to the merits hearing. In those circumstances, it is usual for the tribunal to make a prima facie decision on jurisdiction on the assumption  \nthat the facts pleaded by the claimant are correct. It will then be open to the\u00a0respondent, if its preliminary objection fails, to have a second \"bite at the cherry\" at the merits hearing on the basis of the facts that will then be determined.\n\n120. The Tribunal rejects Panama's submission that it has no authority on an expedited objection to competence under Article 10.20.5 to reach a decision on a prima facie basis and to join the issue of competence to the merits of the dispute.\n\nSuch authority is essential if the Tribunal is to be in a position to prevent the hearing of the expedited objection turning into a mini, or even a maxi, trial. It is also consonant with the obligation under Article 10.20.5 to \"suspend any proceedings on the merits.\"  \n**A decision to join the objection to the merits of the dispute will satisfy the Tribunal's obligation under Article 10.20.5 to issue an expedited decision on the objection.**\n\n121. It is, however, open to the Tribunal to make a determinative finding of fact and to base a final award or decision upon this at the expedited phase if it considers this appropriate. In this case, Panama's Expedited Objections, apart from Objection No.  \n3, do not raise any significant issues of fact. Far from disputing the facts alleged by the Claimants, Panama's objections are essentially based upon these. The Claimants have adduced a body of evidence in support of their pleaded case, but again this evidence has not been significantly challenged. The issues are essentially  \nissues of law, not fact.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nResponse, \u00b6150; *Bridgestone Licensing Services, Inc. and Bridgestone Americas, Inc. v.

Day 1, 184: 20-25 (\u201cMr. Moloo: What I would submit to this Tribunal, however, is in exercising its discretion under the UNCITRAL Rules,  \nthat is the test that should apply and that is the test that indeed Bridgestone applied because it makes sense.\u201d); Tr. Day 2, 331: 18-20 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: The relevant quote from Bridgestone is Paragraph 118, which was quoted by Claimant in its written response to Colombia\u2019s Article 10.20.5 objection.\u201d).\n\n118..\n\nConsidering the Parties\u2019 agreement that the Tribunal enjoys discretion by virtue of Arts. 10.20.5 of the TPA and 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules, and based on the above dicta from Bridgestone, and other cases which were decided under treaties with substantively identical language to that  \nof the TPA,121 the Tribunal understands that it may make a final determination of the facts if it is able to do so. However, if there is a risk that in deciding a factual issue the Tribunal may prejudge questions going beyond the question of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal may postpone  \nthat determination to the merits stage.122\n\n*Daniel W.

Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, 13 March 2020, \u00b6226, 228 (**CLA-54**).\n\nBetween the two Hearing days, on 15 December 2023 (at 00:21 ET) by way of a letter sent by the PCA to the Parties, the Tribunal asked the Parties to identify: (i) \u201cwhat factual (not legal) issues must the Tribunal resolve to determine the jurisdictional issues under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA\u201d, (ii) \u201cof those factual issues, which are contested\u201d, (iii) \u201cof the  \ncontested factual issues, which are capable of being resolved definitively in the present expedited preliminary phase (i.e. which are not intertwined with the merits of the case)?\u201d The Parties\u2019 answers to these questions, given during the Hearing on 15 December 2023 and in their power point presentations, are incorporated in the discussion below, to the extent relevant and helpful (*see, e.g., \u00b6128*).\n\n119..\n\nAs further elaborated below, the Tribunal considers that the factual issues that require determination at this stage, even if limited in number and scope, could potentially impact the merits of the dispute and, therefore, out of an abundance of caution, the Tribunal will only  \ndecide those issues on a prima facie basis, as per paragraph 119 of Bridgestone. However, reaching such prima facie conclusions still requires the Tribunal to test the strength of Respondent\u2019s objections,\u00a0 and so to a certain extent Claimant\u2019s affirmative case on jurisdiction,\u00a0to determine whether Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional challenge should succeed \u2013 a substantive exercise requiring a commensurate degree of analysis, particularly in view of the number and complexity of the issues that lie for determination before the Tribunal at this early stage of the proceedings.\n\n**A. JURIDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE (ART. 10.28 OF THE TPA)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1) Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n120..\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae because Claimant has never invested in Colombia and, therefore, is not a protected foreign investor within the meaning of Art. 10.28 of the TPA.123 It argues that in treaties like the TPA, \u201cit is imperative to meet the expectations of the State parties by proving that the corporation that seeks its protection has actively and personally invested in order to secure the alleged investment.\u201d124  \nA purported investor cannot simply rely on an ownership or control interest through the contribution of other persons. 125 Neither is incorporation sufficient to entitle one to the protection afforded by the treaty.126 Rather, Article 10.28 of the TPA provides that an \u201cinvestor\u201d  \nmust be someone who \u201chas made an investment in the territory\u201d of Colombia, such that an allegation of \u201crights on a sea area on which there may be an asset theoretically capable of constituting an investment\u201d is insufficient.127\n\nAnswer, \u00b656-57;

(viii) Claimant\u2019s appeal of the Third Civil Court of Barranquilla;\n\n- correspondence between the US Embassy in Colombia and Claimant;\n\n- Claimant\u2019s letters to the Legal Secretary of the President of Colombia and the Antiquities Commission in September 2017, to the newly elected President Iv\u00e1n Duque in August 2018, and to the Vice-President of Colombia in December 2018 and March 2019.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6138;

Rejoinder, \u00b6148-151.\n\nResponse, \u00b6206-209.\n\n124..\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments in its Submission about the insufficiency or the incompleteness of SSA Cayman\u2019s asset transfer to SSA are, in Claimant\u2019s view, meritless.133 The APA, pursuant to which SSA Cayman sold \u201csubstantially all of the assets to SSA\u201d is a valid and fully executed  \nintra-company agreement that transferred SSA Cayman\u2019s vested rights in the discovered shipwreck to SSA (including the rights to benefit from DIMAR\u2019s licenses).134 While certain assets were excluded from assignment, none of these relate to SSA Cayman\u2019s rights to the  \nSan Jos\u00e9.135 Pursuant to the APA, Claimant \u201cowns and \u201ccontrols\u201d the rights vested under, inter alia, DIMAR\u2019s Resolution No. 0048 of 29 January 1980 (which was extended by Resolutions\u00a0Nos. 0066 of 1 February 1981, 0025 of 9 January 1982, 249 of 22 April 1982) and Resolution No. 0354 of 3 June 1982.136\n\nResponse, \u00b6171.\n\nResponse, \u00b6165, 170, 174.\n\nResponse, \u00b6165, 170, 174.\n\nResponse, \u00b6176; Rejoinder, \u00b6171.\n\n125..\n\nIn its Rejoinder, in response to Respondent\u2019s Reply, Claimant argues that that the TPA does not require a protected investor: (i) to have \u201cactively\u201d or \u201cpersonally\u201d invested; and (ii) to contribute capital to Colombia.137 The cases cited by Respondent in support of the argument that Claimant must have \u201cactively\u201d or \u201cpersonally\u201d invested are of little use, since they either involved differently-worded treaties, 138 or were set aside at the seat of arbitration.139\u00a0Respondent\u2019s second prong of the argument is based on a mischaracterization of the relevant  \nprovision of the TPA.140 The TPA neither requires \u201cthe act of investing in Colombia\u201d, nor that Claimant\u2019s acts \u201cbring substantial benefit to Colombia.\u201d141\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6153-166.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6154, 157-161.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6155, 156.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6163.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6164-166.\n\n126..\n\nTherefore, Claimant is an \u201cinvestor\u201d within the meaning of Art. 10.28 of the TPA.\n\n**3) Non-disputing party's position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n127..\n\nThe Non-disputing party did not address the notion of \u201cinvestor of a Party.\u201d Its submissions on the definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d are summarized at section IV.C.3) below.\n\n**4) Analysis**\n---------------\n\n128..\n\nArticle 10.28 defines an \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d as follows:\n\na Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts through concrete action to **make, is making, or has made** an investment in the territory of another Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n129..\n\nDuring the Hearing, Respondent submitted that when determining whether Claimant is an \u201cinvestor of a Party,\u201d the following factual issues must be determined:142\n\n- \u201cWhether Claimant [has met] its burden of proof that it invested in Colombia to secure the alleged investment;\n\n- Whether the APA [constitutes] a sufficient basis to meet the burden of proof that Claimant invested in Colombia to secure the alleged Investment;\n\n- Whether the alleged assumed but deferred and unsigned liability with Chicago Maritime Corporation [constitutes] a sufficient basis to meet the burden of proof that Claimant invested in Colombia to secure the alleged investment;\n\n- Whether the alleged assumed liability under the 1988 management contract with IOTA Partners [constitutes] a sufficient basis to meet the burden of proof that Claimant invested in Colombia to secure the alleged investment;\n\n- Whether the exchanges of correspondence and sums invested by SSA LLC in order to initiate litigation against the Republic of Colombia before the DC District Court and the IACH [constitute] a sufficient basis to meet the burden of proof that Claimant invested in Colombia to secure the alleged Investment.\u201d\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, slide 47.\n\n130..\n\nClaimant, on the other hand, advanced the following questions:143\n\n- \u201cwhether SSA is a US enterprise;\n\n- whether SSA \u201cmade\u201d an investment by acquiring it; and\n\n- whether the investment is in the territory of Colombia.\u201d\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal and Closing Statement, slide 5.\n\n131..\n\nConsidering that the notion of \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d in Art. 10.28 of the TPA is inextricably linked to the notion of \u201cinvestment\u201d \u2013 to paraphrase the tribunal in Clorox Espa\u00f1a S.L. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, (annulled, but not in this specific point) they are two sides of the same  \ncoin144 \u2013 and that Respondent itself appears to have treated the two objections jointly during the Hearing, 145 the Tribunal deems it appropriate and efficient, in light of the fact that Claimant\u2019s US nationality appears uncontested, 146 to deal comprehensively with Respondent\u2019s ratione personae objection together with its ratione materiae objection in the following section.\n\n*Clorox Espa\u00f1a S.L. v.

Submission, \u00b6238-271.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6238, 266-271.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6268.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6266.\n\n133..\n\nIn its Reply to Claimant\u2019s Response, Respondent urges the Tribunal to view Article 10.28 of the TPA through the prism of the three requisite characteristics of an investment set out in subparagraphs (g) and (h) of that Article, none of which, in its view, is present: (i) commitment of capital or other resources; (ii) the expectation of gain or profit; and (iii) the assumption of risk.151\n\nReply, \u00b6237-241.\n\n**(a) The requirement under Art. 10.28 of the TPA are not met**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134..\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s submission, Claimant\u2019s argument that it has an investment because it controls or owns the relevant DIMAR Resolutions must fail.152 First, there is no evidence of Claimant\u2019s contribution of capital.153 The \u201ccommitment of capital or other resources\u201d is inherent in the act of investing, since without such commitment of resources, the asset, even if belonging to the claimant, would not be the result of it having invested.154 Mere ownership of an asset would not amount to a protected investment.155\n\nSubmission, \u00b6238-252.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6246-252; Reply, \u00b6242-253.\n\nReply, \u00b6243.\n\nReply, \u00b6246.\n\n135..\n\nHere, Respondent asserts that Claimant has failed to prove that it personally invested in Colombia after signing the APA with SSA Cayman Islands.156 Moreover, there is no evidence that assignment has ever been completed, i.e. that the conditions, envisaged in the APA, under which SSA Cayman had promised to transfer certain assets to Claimant, have been fulfilled.157\u00a0Ultimately, Claimant has not only brought no substantial benefit to Respondent, but has in fact negatively impacted Colombia by extending a dispute initiated on 7 July 1994 for more than 30 years and requiring the State to expend significant resources in different fora to defend itself.158\n\nReply, \u00b6247.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6240-245; Reply, \u00b6247-248.\n\nReply, \u00b6250.\n\n136..\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that Claimant fails to prove that it made any substantial commitment of capital from which an expectation of gain or profit can be derived.159 This is because, when entering into the APA, Claimant \u201cknew or at least should have known the  \nColombian government had already denied any property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.\u201d160\n\nReply, \u00b6255.\n\nReply, \u00b6256, 259.\n\n137..\n\nThird, in Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant did not assume any risk with the alleged investment.161 This is because, \u201cwhen entering the APA, both SSA Cayman Islands and SSA LLC knew that any rights SSA Cayman Islands claimed to have over Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 were definitively and  \nundoubtedly quashed by the 2007 CSJ Decision, in conjunction with the 1994 Press Release\u201d.162 As such, any risk concerning the alleged rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 had already materialized with the 2007 CSJ Decision.\n\nReply, \u00b6262-269.\n\nReply, \u00b6265.\n\n**(b) Claimant never owned or controlled a protected investment under Art. 10.28(g) of the TPA**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138..\n\nAccording to Respondent, at no time did Claimant own or control a protected investment under Art. 10.28(g) of the TPA because: (i) the DIMAR resolutions were not conferred to Claimant pursuant to Colombia\u2019s domestic law, and (ii) the DIMAR Resolutions do not create in rem rights under domestic law over specific shipwrecks, let alone over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.163\n\nReply, \u00b6272.\n\n139..\n\nRespondent submits that the relevant DIMAR Resolutions were not transferred to Claimant in compliance with Colombian law.164 Under Art. 10.28(g) of the TPA, \u201clicenses, authorizations, permits and similar rights\u201d have to be \u201cconferred pursuant to domestic law\u201d in order to qualify as a protected \u201cinvestment\u201d.165 Pursuant to Colombian domestic law, DIMAR has the exclusive power to grant authorizations for marine exploration activities, including by authorizing the assignment of exploration rights between private parties.166 Indeed, DIMAR authorized the assignment of exploration rights from GMC Inc. to Glocca Morra Company in 1980, and from Glocca Morra Company to SSA Cayman Islands in 1983.167 By contrast, the assignment of rights to Claimant was not authorized by DIMAR, which makes such transfer non-compliant\u00a0with Colombian domestic law, thereby undermining Claimant\u2019s argument that it has an investment within the meaning of Art. 10.28(g) of the TPA.168\n\nSubmission, \u00b6238, 253-265; Reply, \u00b6273-287.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6254; Reply, \u00b6273.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6256-257.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6262.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6263-265.\n\n140..\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the conduct of Claimant\u2019s alleged predecessor shows that the assignment of exploration rights from SSA Cayman Islands to Claimant required DIMAR\u2019s authorization.169 Both GMC and SSA Cayman Islands understood that the assignment of rights required DIMAR\u2019s authorization.170\n\nReply, \u00b6274, 281.\n\nReply, \u00b6276.\n\n141..\n\nColombia further asserts that it is not estopped from arguing that the assignment of rights from SSA Cayman Islands to Claimant required DIMAR\u2019s authorization because:171\n\n- only SSA Cayman Islands (not SSA) acted as plaintiff in civil proceedings that led to the 2007 CSJ Decision;\n\n- Colombia had clearly and consistently denied any property rights based on the  \n1982 Report;\n\n- in the U.S., Colombia\u2019s motion to dismiss was made under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which required the factual allegations presented by the SSA to be presumed as truthful;\n\n- Colombia successfully opposed the recognition and enforcement of the 2007 CSJ Decision on the basis that it was not a money judgment.172\n\nReply, \u00b6274, 282-287.\n\nReply, \u00b6283, 284, 285.\n\n142..\n\nFurthermore, Respondent submits that DIMAR Resolutions No. 0048 and No. 0354 do not create in rem rights over any specific shipwreck, let alone the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.173 This is because \u201ca resolution recognizing a private company as a reporter of treasures does not create any in rem rights over the reported species, much less to unreported species as in the case of Glocca Morra Company, but rather a mere expectation of a right, which is completely contingent on the reporter positively establishing that a reported species is in fact in the reported area, and moreover, on the States expressing its positive desire to extract the shipwrecked species.\u201d 174 Notably, Resolution No. 0048 did not authorize exploration of Colombian waters in search for the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, nor was it intended or could have been  \nintended to create any specific in rem right. Rather it merely designated certain areas in which the company was authorized to develop underwater exploration activities. 175 Similarly,\u00a0Resolution No. 0354 did not create any in rem right over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9; it merely recognized GMC as a reporter of the treasures referred to in the 1982 Report.176\n\nReply, \u00b6288-310.\n\nReply, \u00b6298\n\nReply, \u00b6292.\n\nReply, \u00b6294, 301.\n\n143..\n\nThat these resolutions do not create in rem rights can also be ascertained, in Respondent\u2019s view, from the civil proceedings arising out of the Civil Action filed by SSA Cayman Islands in 1983.177 The 2007 CSJ Decision is likewise exemplary.178\n\nReply, \u00b6303-306.\n\nReply, \u00b6305, 306.\n\n**2) Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n144..\n\nClaimant observes that the term \u201cInvestment\u201d is defined broadly in Art. 10.28 of the TPA and encompasses \u201cevery asset\u201d that is capable of being owned or controlled, irrespective of whether that control or ownership is \u201cdirect[]\u201d or \u201cindirect[]\u201d.179 An investment under the TPA can be described by any of the following characteristics: a commitment of capital (not a \u201ccontribution\u201d of capital, as Respondent erroneously argues)180 or other resources, expectation of gain or profit, or assumption of risk.181 Accordingly, Claimant submits that it is not required for the investor to have committed the capital itself.182 Even the \u201ccommitment of capital or other resources\u201d is not a necessary criterion for every investment to exist. 183 Yet, the SSA Predecessors (GMC and its parent company GMC Inc., SSA Cayman) spent thousands of man hours and over USD 11 million in exploring, finding and reporting the wreck of the San Jose, and additional amounts to support the enforcement of their legal rights to the discovery.184 By means of the APA, SSA made a \u201ccommitment of capital\u201d, since it assumed the obligation to pay \u201cas and when due\u201d SSA Cayman\u2019s \u201cAssumed Liabilities.\u201d 185 Additionally, Claimant\u2019s \u201ccommitment of capital\u201d is likewise evident from the significant amount of money, time and resources spent to salvage the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck.186 As such, Claimant concludes that its acquisition of SSA Cayman\u2019s assets, rights and interests under the APA plainly has the \u201ccharacteristics of an investment\u201d.187\n\nResponse, \u00b6164; Rejoinder, \u00b6168.\n\nResponse, \u00b6187.\n\nResponse, \u00b6164; Rejoinder, \u00b6172, 178-208.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6184.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6179.\n\nResponse, \u00b6167, 190; Rejoinder, \u00b6183, 193-194, 204.\n\nResponse, \u00b6189;

Rejoinder, \u00b6209.\n\nResponse, \u00b6178.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6209.\n\n147..\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Claimant also responded to Colombia\u2019s new objections that the investment lacks an \u201cexpectation of gain or profit\u201d and the \u201cassumption of risk\u201d.199 Claimant submits that these objections are belated, since they were not raised within 45 days of the Tribunal\u2019s constitution.200 Moreover, these objections are unfounded. The TPA does not require that the\u00a0commitment of capital must be made with the expectation of gain or profit, or that the expectation of gain or profit cannot be found without a commitment of capital or other resources.201 As such, case law based on differently worded treaties is irrelevant.202\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6175-176.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6197, 203.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6199.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6205-207\n\n148..\n\nBy reference to Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimant has no investment because the DIMAR resolutions did not grant in rem rights, Claimant submits it is both \u201cunclear and untenable\u201d.203 First, said objection is improper as it is not responsive to Claimant\u2019s Response.204 Second, there is nothing the TPA that requires Claimant\u2019s rights to be in rem in order to constitute an investment.205 Had there been any doubt that Claimant had fully vested rights, the Colombia Supreme Court would have decided differently, instead of rejecting the very arguments Colombia is advancing in this Arbitration.206\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6220.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6221.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6222.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6224.\n\n**3) Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n149..\n\nAccording to the U.S., the enumeration of a type of an asset in Art. 10.28 of the TPA is \u201cnot dispositive as to whether a particular asset, owned or controlled by an investor, meets the definition of investment\u201d because \u201cit must still always possess the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\u201d207 The U.S. further submits that \u201cit is implicit that the protections in Chapter Ten only apply to investments made in compliance with the host state\u2019s domestic law at the time that the investment is established or acquired.\u201d208 It nonetheless notes that \u201ctrivial violations of the applicable law will not put an investment outside the scope of Article 10.28.\u201d209\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b67.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b68.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b68.\n\n**4) Analysis**\n---------------\n\n150..\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration, Claimant argued that the 2007 CSJ Decision itself effectively confirms that it \u201cowns\u201d and \u201ccontrols\u201d \u201cdirectly\u201d, among others, \u201clicenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law\u201d which grant SSA the authorization to explore, discover, and acquire rights to discoveries in Colombian waters, including through:\n\n- DIMAR Resolution No. 0048 of 29 January 1980 authorizing GMC Inc. to search for shipwrecks (later broadened and extended by DIMAR Resolutions, including Nos. 0066 of 1 February 1981; 0025 of 29 January 1982; 249 of 22 April 1982); and\n\n- DIMAR Resolution No. 0354 of 3 June 1982 recognizing GMC as reporter of the shipwrecked treasures and artefacts and acknowledging GMC \u201cas claimant of the treasures or shipwreck.\u201d210\n\nNoA, \u00b666-67. *See also* Response, \u00b6176.\n\n151..\n\nIn its subsequent written pleadings, Claimant submitted that SSA made a qualifying investment in Colombia in 2008 by virtue of the APA by acquiring virtually all of the assets and rights of its predecessor, SSA Cayman, including rights to 50% of the treasure in the Discovery Area, which were originally vested in GMC by Resolutions Nos. 0048 and 0354 and Arts. 700 and 701 of the Civil Code211 and were later transferred to SSA Cayman.212\n\nResponse, \u00b6179; Rejoinder, \u00b6171.\n\nResponse, \u00b6161; Rejoinder, \u00b6151.\n\n152..\n\nWhile it is \u201cwell established that rights arising from contracts may amount to investments,\u201d213  \nthe Tribunal must consider Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in light of Art. 10.28 of the TPA which defines \u201cinvestment\u201d as follows:\n\nevery asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the\u00a0characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk. Forms that an investment may take include:\n\n(a) an enterprise;\n\n(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;\n\n(c) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans;\n\n(d) futures, options, and other derivatives;\n\n(e) turnkey, construction, management, production, concession, revenue-sharing, and other similar contracts;\n\n(f) intellectual property rights;\n\n**(g) licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to****domestic law**; and\n\n**(h) other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related****property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;**\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2022, p. 126, \u00b6148 (**CLA-20bis**).\n\n153..\n\nDuring the Hearing, Respondent identified the following factual issues as being relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on its ratione materiae objection:214\n\n- \u201cwhether Article 701 allows for the recognition of 50% rights in respect to a specific treasure not found in another\u2019s land;\n\n- whether DIMAR Resolution No. 0048 [was] granted for the specific purpose of looking for the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9;\n\n- whether DIMAR Resolution No. 0354 recognized Glocca Morra Company as a reporter of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in particular;\n\n- whether the 1982 Confidential Report reported the finding of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in particular;\n\n- whether the Columbus Report, as adopted by Colombia, rejected the hypothesis of the finding of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 by Glocca Morra Company;\n\n- whether the 2007 CSJ Decision declared any rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in particular;\n\n- whether the 2007 CSJ Decision declared any rights over areas different or additional to the specific coordinates indicated in the 1982 Confidential Report.\u201d\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, slide 48.\n\n154..\n\nClaimant, conversely, proposed only two issues for determination at this juncture:  \n215\n\n- \u201cwhether SSA \u2018owns or controls\u2019 50% of the treasure in the Discovery Area; and\n\n- whether rights to 50% of the treasure in the Discovery Area had investment characteristics such as (a) commitment of capital; (b) commitment of other resources; (c) expectation of gain or profit; (d) assumption of risk; and (e) duration.\u201d\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal and Closing Statement, slide 5.\n\n155..\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, as already anticipated at paragraph 119 above, many if not all the factual issues that have been proposed by Respondent for determination (listed above) need not (and, in fact, cannot) be decided at this stage, as they are inextricably linked to the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal would require such issues to be fully aired on the basis of additional factual and/or expert evidence to be in a position to reach a final determination.\n\n156..\n\nConversely, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s list of proposed issues for determination in connection with Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objection properly captures the analysis required under the textual definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d in Art. 10.28 of the TPA.\n\n157..\n\nAt this stage, therefore the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is twofold: it must first analyze whether DIMAR Resolutions Nos. 0048 and 0354 created or recognised rights capable of comprising an \u201cinvestment\u201d, and if so, whether such rights were validly acquired by Claimant. This inquiry does not require the Tribunal to rule on whether or not those rights pertained to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9. In analyzing Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objection, the Tribunal will largely mirror the structure laid out both under Art. 10.28 of the TPA and in Respondent\u2019s Reply, such that it will first consider whether Claimant\u2019s alleged investment possesses the characteristics of an investment (**IV.C.4(a)**), and thereafter whether Claimant \u201cowns\u201d or \u201ccontrols\u201d such an investment (**IV.C.4(b)**)\n\n(a) Does Claimant's alleged investment possess the characteristics of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Art. 10.28 of the TPA?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158..\n\nAs already noted, Art. 10.28 of the TPA defines the term \u201cinvestment\u201d as \u201cevery asset [\u2026] that has the characteristics of an investment\u201d. This provision includes a non-exhaustive list of such \u201ccharacteristics\u201d that are considered to be intrinsic to an investment: \u201c[\u2026] including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\u201d\n\n159..\n\nAlthough the TPA does not preclude the Tribunal from assessing characteristics other than those listed in Art. 10.28 of the TPA when determining whether a qualifying investment exists, the Tribunal will focus its inquiry on the three characteristics, or criteria, expressly identified by the parties to the TPA: the commitment of capital or other resources (i); the expectation of gain or profit (ii); and the assumption of risk (iii).\n\n*i. Did Claimant's alleged investment include a commitment of capital or other resources?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160..\n\nThe Tribunal will address first whether Claimant\u2019s alleged investment (i.e. the acquisition of SSA Cayman\u2019s purported rights to 50% of the treasure in the Discovery Area by way of the APA) includes a \u201ccommitment of capital or other resources\u201d.\n\n161..\n\nIn its written pleadings, Respondent used the terms \u201ccontribution of capital\u201d 216 and \u201c*commitment* of capital\u201d interchangeably, 217 always denying that Claimant\u2019s purported investment displayed such a feature in the present case. Claimant, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of the applicable treaty language, which at Art. 10.28 refers to a\u00a0*\u201ccommitment* of capital or other resources\u201d (as opposed to a \u201ccontribution\u201d), 218 and argued that the alleged investment indeed reflects such a \u201ccommitment.\u201d219 According to Claimant, the word \u201ccommitment\u201d denotes the intention of the TPA contracting parties to include promises to provide capital or other resources in the future.220\n\nSubmission, \u00b6246-252.\n\nReply, \u00b6242-253.\n\nResponse, \u00b6187. *See also* Tr.

Grenada], this does not turn on the magic of the word \u201ccommitment\u201d versus \u201ccontribution\u201d since in Malicorp they were talking about a contribution of capital.\n\nTr. Day 1, 258: 20-25, 259:1-15 (\u201cMr. Moloo: So the question is not whether or not the investor contributed or, in fact, committed \u2013 not just committed, but contributed capital, but whether or not the investment reflects a commitment. And in this case, actually, a contribution of capital. Nonetheless, SSA itself committed capital in many ways. It assumed several liabilities, including the payment of contractual obligations. It assumed the requirement to distribute profits amongst the Economic Interest Holders. It assumed certain contracts that had along with them certain obligations. And if you go to the next slide, you can see what some of those were. Among other things, there was a management agreement that had management fees associated with it that were deferred. There was in the limited partnership agreement an obligation, so a liability to pay Chicago Maritime Corporation USD 1.2 million. These were all assumptions of liability and commitments to make the payments that were assumed by SSA, specifically in the APA when they acquired their investment in 2008.\u201d)\n\nResponse, \u00b6187; Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slides 112-113.\n\n162..\n\nArt. 10.28 of the TPA does not define the term \u201ccommitment\u201d. However, to the extent such term has been interpreted and applied in investment treaty arbitration practice, the authorities cited by Respondent on this issue mostly appear to either use the terms \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201ccommitment\u201d interchangeably, or to favour \u201ccommitment\u201d.\n\n163..\n\nFor example, in *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, where a *ratione materiae* objection was partially upheld due to there being no proof of \u201cany contribution whatsoever,\u201d221 when interpreting the notion of \u201cinvestment\u201d in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, the tribunal stated that \u201ca **contribution** of assets (that is, a **commitment** of resources), risk and duration are all three part [sic] of the ordinary definition of investment\u201d (emphasis added).222 The tribunal in *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan* echoed this idea.223 Similarly, in *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A.\u015e. v. Islamic**Republic of Pakistan*, again in the context of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, the tribunal noted that \u201cto qualify as an investment, the project in question must constitute a substantial\u00a0**commitment** on the side of the investor\u201d and that, \u201cin the case at hand, it cannot be seriously contested that Bayindir made a significant **contribution**\u201d (emphasis added).224\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v.

Republic of Uzbekistan, the tribunal was \u201crequired to interpret the term \u2018investments\u2019 as found in Article 1(2) of the BIT,\u201d225 which provision did not refer to either \u201ccontribution\u201d or \u201ccommitment.\u201d The tribunal in that case noted that the \u201c\u2019ordinary meaning\u2019 of the term \u2018investments\u2019 is the commitment of funds or other assets with the purpose to receive a profit, or \u2018return,\u2019 from that commitment of capital\u201d (emphasis added).226\n\nRomak S.A.

Moldova* made no reference to either \u201ccommitment\u201d or \u201ccontribution\u201d, the tribunal noted that the noun \u201cinvestment\u201d, according to common dictionary definitions, means variously: \u201cthe outlay of money usually for income or profit: capital outlay; **the act** of putting money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage, or the money, effort, time, etc. used to do this; or the act of investing money in something or the money that you invest, or the thing that you invest in\u201d (emphasis added).227 In other words, according to the tribunal in that case, \u201cinherent in the notion of an investment is some **contribution** which is made in an attempt to earn a return over a period of time, a process that necessarily involves the possibility or risk of not earning a return\u201d (italics in the original; emphasis in bold added).228 The tribunal also referred to common dictionary definitions of the verb \u201cinvest\u201d: \u201cto **commit (money)** in order to earn a financial return; to put money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage; or to buy property, shares in a company, etc. in the hope of making a profit\u201d (emphasis added).229\n\n*Komaksavia Airport Invest Ltd. v.

The views expressed in Malicorp Limited v. Egypt and RSM Production Corporation v. Government of Grenada, where tribunals held that \u201ccommitment\u201d entails promises to make contributions in the future, are persuasive.230 Based on the current record, the Tribunal is unpersuaded by\u00a0Respondent\u2019s position that \u201cClaimant\u2019s alleged investment does not include a \u201ccommitment of capital or other resources\u201d as referenced in Art. 10.28 of the TPA.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slides 112-113.\n\n167..\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Claimant's argument with respect to \u201ccommitment,\u201d at a high level, is two-fold: (a) Claimant\u2019s Predecessors committed capital and other resources, which suffices for an \u201cinvestment\u201d to exist because Claimant need only demonstrate that it acquired assets that constitute an investment, not that it committed capital or other resources itself;231 (b) in any event, Claimant itself committed capital or other resources (which may include knowhow, equipment, personnel and services) 232 by acquiring SSA Cayman\u2019s assets, rights and interests under the APA.233\n\nResponse, \u00b6183; Rejoinder, \u00b6183-186; Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slide 107-109; Tr.

Peru, wherein the tribunal found that claimant\u2019s acquisition of rights and shares free of charge from a relative did not \u201cmean that the persons from whom she acquired these shares and rights did not previously make very considerable investments of which ownership was transmitted to the [c]laimant by perfectly legitimate legal instruments.\u201d238\n\nClaimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slide 107; Tr.

Those authorities concern differently worded treaties, all of which tie the notion of \u201cinvestment\u201d to \u201cinvestor\u201d. Notably, the Cyprus-Moldova BIT at issue in *Komaksavia Airport Invest Ltd. v.\u00a0Republic of Moldova defined \u201cinvestments\u201d as \u201c*every kind of asset invested by investors, for the purpose of acquisition of economic benefit or other business purpose, of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legislation of the latter [\u2026]\u201d (emphasis added).239\n\n*Komaksavia Airport Invest Ltd. v.

Notably, the TPA definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d does not require that an asset be \u201cinvested by  \ninvestors,\u201d as pointed out by Claimant. 243 As the Komaksavia Airport tribunal itself acknowledged, \u201cthe phrase \u2018invested by investors\u2019 is not present in all BIT definitions of investment\u201d,244 and, in the great majority of cases, \u201cownership of shares by an investor [\u2026] will in general be considered as sufficient for fostering international protection.\u201d245\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6157-159.\n\n*Komaksavia Airport Invest Ltd. v.

Sin embargo, **aunque el Tratado exija una acci\u00f3n de invertir por el inversor, nada en su texto permite excluir que el inversor invierta en una inversi\u00f3n ya realizada por un tercero originalmente en el territorio de la otra parte Contratante. Tal y como acertadamente lo observa la Demandante**: \"El TBI no proh\u00edbe que Clorox Spain se convierta en un inversor protegido al adquirir acciones de Clorox Venezuela en vez de realizar la inyecci\u00f3n inicial de fondos en las operaciones de Clorox Venezuela\".

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, PCA Case No. 2015-30, Award, 20 May 2019, \u00b6803 (**RLA-30**).\n\n175..\n\nMoreover, as the tribunal in Addiko Bank AG v. Montenegro noted, the \u201cClorox tribunal, in interpreting the terms \u2018assets invested by investors\u2019, did not state that the investor had to have an active role in order to have an investment that is protected, but only that the claimant has to make a showing of an \u2018investment action\u2019, i.e. that claimant did something that could be deemed investing\u201d248 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Addiko Bank AG v. Montenegro*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/35, Award, 24 November 2021, \u00b6359 (CLA-80).\n\n176..\n\nIn any event, as pointed out by Claimant,249 that award was annulled at the seat of arbitration precisely because the tribunal had read additional requirements into the treaty.250\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6155-156.\n\n177..\n\nApart from the authorities cited by Respondent, it is noted that the argument that the phrase \u201cinvested by investors\u201d limits treaty protections only to \u201cactive\u201d investors was made (and rejected) in a number of other cases. For instance, in Vladislav Kim et al. v. Republic of Uzbekistan the tribunal held that the applicable treaty contained no distinction between active and passive investors, despite the inclusion of the phrase \u201cinvested by investors\u201d in the definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d.251 In Addiko Bank AG v. Montenegro, the tribunal similarly concluded that \u201cthe words \u2018assets invested by an investor\u2019 does not mean [\u2026] that the investment must\u00a0have been an \u2018active investment\u2019 that was made \u2018through the contribution of resources to Montenegro or an exchange of resources to acquire an asset.\u201d252\n\n*Vladislav Kim et al. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICISD Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2017, \u00b610, 306-308, 310-312 (**CLA-39**).\n\n*Addiko Bank AG v. Montenegro*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/35, Award, 24 November 2021, \u00b6319 (**CLA-80**).\n\n178..\n\nIn the light of all of the above, the Tribunal is unable to conclude at this juncture that there is a requirement under the TPA for an \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpersonal\u201d investment by the purported investor, whether express or by necessary implication. Even if, for the sake of argument, such a  \nrequirement were actually expressed or implied by the TPA, the Tribunal would nonetheless remain unconvinced by Respondent\u2019s argument.\n\n179..\n\nWhatever the precise magnitude of the commitment required by the TPA, the Tribunal has no basis to doubt at this stage that SSA\u2019s Predecessors poured significant resources into their exploration efforts.253 Considering the absence of contradictory evidence on this point, and given that these facts may be tested further in a subsequent stage of the proceedings, as per paragraph 119 of Bridgestone the Tribunal proceeds on the assumption that these facts as pleaded by Claimant are correct, that is, that Claimant\u2019s Predecessors committed capital or other resources within the meaning of Article 10.28 of the TPA.\n\n180..\n\nFor similar reasons, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt at this stage Claimant\u2019s submission that it committed capital and other resources itself in the context of its acquisition, by way of the 2008 APA, of SSA Cayman\u2019s purported rights to 50% of the treasure in the Discovery Area. Pursuant to the APA, 254 among other things Claimant assumed liabilities not only to SSA Cayman\u2019s \u201cEconomic Interest Holders\u201d but also to its creditors.255 The Tribunal shares the views of the tribunal in Saluka v. The Czech Republic, which held that it would be incorrect to exclude from the definition of \u201cinvestor\u201d those \u201cwho purchase shares as part of what might be termed bare profit-making or profit-taking transactions.\u201d256\n\nAsset Purchase Agreement between Armada Company and Sea Search-Armada, LLC, 18 November 2008 (**C-30bis**).\n\n181..\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent\u2019s argument that Art. 10.28 of the TPA is an expression of the idea that \u201cthe alleged investor must make a meaningful transfer of resources into the economy of the host State,\u201d257 which was Respondent\u2019s answer to Claimant\u2019s argument that it undertook an economic commitment \u201cthat brought substantial benefit to Colombia by finding and attempting to salvage the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck.\u201d According to Respondent, SSA\u2019s statement is \u201ccompletely unacceptable and [\u2026] plainly false\u201d because SSA has actually \u201cnegatively impacted Colombia by extending a dispute established on 7 July\u00a01994 for more than 30 years and requiring Colombia to expend significant resources in different for a to defend from an artificial allegation of property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.\u201d258\n\nReply, \u00b6215, 244.\n\nReply, \u00b6249-250, 252.\n\n182..\n\nThe Tribunal notes, as does Claimant, that reference to a \u201cmeaningful transfer of resources into the economy of the host State\u201d is absent from the TPA.259 The Tribunal further notes that the notion of contribution to the host State\u2019s \u201ceconomic development\u201d as a characteristic of an investment is fairly unique to Salini and has become somewhat contentious.260 Certain tribunals have not considered this feature to rank among the characteristics of an \u201cinvestment\u201d, but rather as one of its consequences.261 Others have underscored that it is not a decisive factor.262 In RSM Production Corporation v. Government of Grenada, which concerned an agreement for the exploration of oil in maritime areas, the tribunal held that the condition of \u201cthe contribution to the economic and social development of the host State [\u2026] must be assessed in consideration of a successful adventure\u201d because \u201cit is not the actual or the final contribution that matters\u201d (since exploration may not lead to exploitation).263 As such, the fact that a venture may not have yielded the desired results should not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, negate the expenditures made in the hopes of a different, positive, outcome. However, since the TPA does not condition the notion of \u201cinvestment\u201d on a contribution to the host State\u2019s \u201ceconomic development,\u201d as announced at paragraph 166 above, the Tribunal need not decide, and will refrain from deciding, whether such a contribution was present in the case at hand.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6181.\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v.

Did Claimant's alleged investment include the expectation of gain or profit?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183..\n\nThe second characteristic of an investment identified in Article 10.28 of the TPA is the \u201cexpectation of gain or profit\u201d. Respondent asserts that Claimant \u201ccould not have had an expectation of gain or profit regarding the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.\u201d264 It derives this conclusion from its reading of the 1994 Press Release (by which, it says, the Colombian government \u201cadopted the report made by Columbus Exploration, which conclusively determined that no shipwreck was found in the coordinates indicated in the 1982 Confidential Report\u201d),265 and the 2007 CSJ\u00a0Decision (by which, it contends, \u201cthe CSJ confirmed that SSA Cayman Islands had no rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9\u201d).266\n\nReply, \u00b6256.\n\nReply, \u00b6257; Letter from President's Office to DIMAR informing of Press Release, 8 July 1994 (R-11); Columbus Exploration, Final report regarding the oceanographic study, 4 August 1994 (R-12).\n\nReply, \u00b625; Colombian Supreme Court of Justice, Case File No. 08001-3103-010-1989-09134-01, Judgment, 5 July 2007 (**C-28**).\n\n184. .\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument, for many reasons. When Claimant\u2019s Predecessors embarked upon this venture in the 1970s, they must have expected to make a profit.267 Without definitively interpreting the meaning or scope of Art. 701 of the Civil Code, nor treading on other legal or factual ground necessarily left to the merits, the Tribunal observes that on its face Art. 701 appears to provide a potential basis for such an expectation by providing that the \u201ctreasure found on another\u2019s land shall be divided equally between the owner of the land and the person who made the discovery.\u201d268 Claimant filed into evidence a 1981 letter, which describes the \u201cSan Joseph [sic] Treasure Estimate.\u201d269 Arguably, SSA\u2019s Predecessors could have expected half of the amounts indicated therein.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slide 117. See also Tr. Day 1, 263: 1-10 (\u201cMr. Moloo: Was there an expectation to make profit? Well, I\u2019m a bit surprised that Colombia suggests that there was not despite saying that there was this \u2013 this was the biggest treasure in the history of humanity. Of course there was an expectation to make a profit. And it\u2019s not just the fact that this was the biggest treasure in the history of humanity, but the Civil Code itself made it clear that if we find the treasure, we get half of it. So of course there was an expectation to make a profit when \u2013 and that\u2019s reflected in the investment that\u2019s made.\u201d)\n\nColombian Civil Code, 31 May 1873, Art. 701 (**C-1**) (Claimant\u2019s translation).\n\nLetter from Dr. Eugene Lyon, 21 September 1981 (**C-7**).\n\n185..\n\nAlthough it may be debated (and presumably will be debated on the merits, and decided at that stage) whether or to what extent the 1994 Press Release or the 2007 CSJ Decision definitively resolved the question of ownership of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, based on the record as it currently stands, it is impossible to ignore that the CSJ appears at least to have recognized that SSA\u2019s Predecessors possessed or were entitled to certain rights, which seem to relate to the rights claimed by SSA in this arbitration: 270\n\n**SECOND**: In accordance with the preceding ruling, the aforementioned second item of the trial court judgment is **MODIFIED**, with the understanding that the property recognized therein, in equal parts, for the Nation and the plaintiff, refers solely and exclusively to assets that, on the one hand, due to their own characteristics and features, in accordance with the circumstances and the guidelines indicated in this ruling, may legally qualify as treasure, as provided by Article 700 of the Civil Code and in accordance with the restriction or limitation imposed on it by Article 14 of Law 163 of 1959, among other applicable legal provisions, and on the other hand, to those goods referred to in Resolution 0354 of June 3, 1982, issued by the General Maritime and Port Directorate, that is, to those that are in \u201cthe coordinates referred\u00a0to in the \u2018Confidential Report on Underwater Exploration conducted by the GLOCCA MORRA Company in the Caribbean Sea, Colombia February 26, 1982,\u201d which does not include other spaces, zones, or areas.\n\n**THIRD**: Notwithstanding the determinations adopted in the two previous points,\n\n**CONFIRM** the rest and pertinent, the aforementioned judgment of first instance.\n\n186..\n\nSpecifically \u2013 though without making any determinations as to the scope and content of the rights at issue \u2013 the Tribunal notes that the CSJ appears to have recognised some form of rights or entitlement to such assets or goods that \u201cmay legally qualify as treasure\u201d as provided by Colombian law and that \u201care referred to in Resolution 0354 of June 3, 1982 [\u2026], that is, to those that are in are in \u2018the coordinates referred to in the \u2018Confidential Report on Underwater Exploration [\u2026]\u2019 which does not include other spaces, zones, or areas,\u201d whatever those expressions may be found to mean.\n\n*iii. Did Claimant's alleged include an assumption of risk?*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188..\n\nAn \u201cassumption of risk\u201d is the third and final characteristic of an investment specified in TPA Article 10.28. In this respect, Respondent has contested that Claimant assumed \u201cany risk by acquiring the supposed \u2018assets\u2019 from SSA Cayman Islands.\u201d272 According to Respondent, \u201cany \u2018risk\u2019 with regards to the alleged rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 had already materialized with the 2007 CSJ Decision\u201d because it \u201cdefinitively and undoubtedly quashed\u201d any rights SSA Cayman claimed to have over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.273\n\nReply, \u00b6264.\n\nReply, \u00b6265, 266.\n\n190..\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant\u2019s submission that a degree of risk is inherent in the \u201ctreasure searching\u201d business.274 Although the Tribunal is unaware of any other case involving an alleged sunken treasure, and no such case was brough to its attention by the Parties, it considers that the comments of the tribunal in RSM Production Corporation v. Government of Grenada apply here by analogy: \u201c[N]ot only is an exploration agreement not significantly distinct in nature from the agreement to exploit known resources, but if anything, it is even more of an investment on the part of the private party given the magnitude of the commercial risk involved\u201d.275\n\n191..\n\nThe Tribunal likewise agrees with Claimant\u2019s contention that a degree of risk was inherent in its assumption of liabilities under the APA (i.e. the obligation to pay not just the SSA Partners but also the creditors and third parties to which the SSA Partners owed debt).276\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6204.\n\n192..\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal struggles to deny that the alleged investment included an assumption of risk.\n\n193..\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis suggests that Claimant\u2019s investment displayed at all relevant times the three characteristics of an investment identified in Art. 10.28 of the TPA: a \u201ccommitment of capital or other resources\u201d, an \u201cexpectation of gain or profit\u201d and an \u201cassumption of risk\u201d. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects on a prima facie basis Respondent\u2019s argument that the assets for which Claimant requests production under the TPA do not qualify as an \u201cinvestment\u201d under the TPA\u201d.\n\n**(b) Does Claimant own or control a protected investment in accordance with Art. 10.28 of the TPA?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194..\n\nHaving concluded that Respondent has failed to establish at this juncture that Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration are not premised on an \u201cinvestment\u201d, the ensuing question is whether Claimant can be said to own or control such presumed investment as required under Article 10.28 of the TPA for the investment to qualify for treaty protection. A related \u2013 yet distinct \u2013 question going to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae is whether Claimant attempted \u201cthrough concrete action to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party\u201d, in which case it would qualify as an \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d also under Article 10.28 of the TPA. Bearing in mind this distinction, the Tribunal will address these separate but interconnected questions as an ensemble.\n\n195..\n\nAt the outset, Respondent questions Claimant\u2019s ability to qualify as an investor because its claim is based on an assignment to it of rights and obligations by SSA Cayman, which assignment was invalid under Colombia law since it was not authorized by DIMAR.\n\n196..\n\nRespondent has provided no expert evidence on this point (or on Colombian law more generally). Neither has Claimant. Each Party invokes the other\u2019s conduct as a basis for their arguments: Respondent refers to the contemporaneous conduct of Claimant\u2019s Predecessors as evidence of their understanding of the need to obtain DIMAR\u2019s authorization to assign any rights derived from DIMAR resolutions,277 whereas Claimant points to Respondent\u2019s failure to invoke the absence of DIMAR\u2019s authorization in various court proceedings and communications with Claimant over many years.278\n\nSubmission, \u00b6261-265; Reply, \u00b6275-281; Tr. Day 2, 391: 10-17 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: Okay. And, moreover, we say that coming back to DIMAR was necessary because, as a matter of principle, you have to come to DIMAR every time you need to carry out marine exploration. And the conduct of the alleged predecessors was absolutely consistent that even after the 1982 Confidential Report, even after Resolution 354, they considered that they still needed marine exploration for the purposes of identification.\u201d).\n\nResponse, \u00b6204; Rejoinder, \u00b6218-219; Tr. Day 2, 430: 18-25, 431: 1 (\u201cMr. Moloo: But to answer your question, Mr. President, we are advancing an estoppel argument with respect to the conduct of the State and the pronouncements of its courts with respect to the rights of SSA. Nowhere in the submissions that I have heard over the last two days have we been pointed to any law in Colombia that shows that DIMAR was required to authorize the transfer of the rights that we now possess. Nowhere. They refer to course of conduct.\u201d)\n\n197..\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether Claimant has shown that the conditions of the APA were met (**i**), and thereafter address the question of DIMAR\u2019s authorization (**ii**). As already noted, the Tribunal\u2019s prima facie conclusions on these issues are relevant to Respondent\u2019s objections *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae*.\n\n***i. Has Claimant shown that the conditions of the APA were met and that the transaction closed?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198..\n\nRespondent has submitted that Claimant failed to provide evidence that the conditions agreed upon in the APA (Art. 2.1) were complied with, that the assets relevant to this arbitration were part of the transaction (i.e. that they were not excluded by virtue of Art. 1.2), and that the transaction effectively closed.279\n\nSubmission, \u00b6242-245.\n\n199..\n\nIn response, Claimant argued that the APA \u201cwas validly signed and executed by the parties\u2019 authorized representatives, confirming that its closing occurred to their satisfaction.\u201d280 Furthermore, Claimant submitted that \u201cthe APA constitutes a broad transfer of substantially all of SSA Cayman\u2019s assets,\u201d281 and that none of the assets that had been excluded from\u00a0assignment related to SSA Cayman\u2019s rights to the San Jos\u00e9.282 In support of its position, Claimant invoked a judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois, which provides that under Illinois law (which governs the APA) a party\u2019s assent is most commonly indicated through a signature (albeit, in the absence of a signature, it may also be derived from a party\u2019s acts and conduct).283\n\nResponse, \u00b6172.\n\nResponse, \u00b6170.\n\nResponse, \u00b6171.\n\n*Abrogast v. Chicago Cubs Baseball Club, LLC*, IL App (1st) 210526, 16 November 2021, \u00b621 (**CLA-79**).\n\n200..\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimant has failed to meet its burden of proof. The APA284 is signed by Claimant and SSA Cayman\u2019s trustee (Armada Company). It is further noted that in its observations on Spain\u2019s Intervention Application,285 Respondent apparently confirms that SSA Cayman\u2019s rights were successfully transferred to Sea Search Armada, LLC in accordance with the contract terms and its governing law, even if it disputes the validity of that transfer under Colombian law:\n\nThat SSA Cayman\u2019s rights were successfully transferred to Sea Search Armada, LLC (see, Response by Ms. Ordo\u00f1ez to President Drymer\u2019s question, Transcripts, p. 475, paras. 7-11), simply implies that they were transferred through the 2008 APA, and in no way can be construed as an acceptance of the fact that Resolution No. 354 was conferred pursuant to domestic law. As argued by Colombia in these proceedings, even if the transfer was successfully made via the APA, conferral of the relevant rights under Colombia\u2019s domestic law still required DIMAR\u2019s authorization (See, Colombia\u2019s Article 10.20.5 Submission, \u00b6 260).Colombia has not abandoned and continues to defend its argument that DIMAR\u2019s authority remains necessary even after Resolution No. 354 was issued, and that it remains all the more relevant as long as marine exploration is needed, as is the case here, given that all exploration rights had ceased at the time of the APA.\n\nAsset Purchase Agreement between Armada Company and Sea Search-Armada, LLC, 18 November 2008 (**C-30bis**).\n\nRespondent\u2019s observations on Spain\u2019s Intervention Application dated 22 December 2023, fn 15.\n\n***ii. Were the rights created by DIMAR's resolutions, on which SSA Bases its claims in the arbitration, validly conferred pursuant to Colombian law?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201..\n\nBy reference to the requirement in item (g) of the definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d at Art. 10.28 of the TPA that any investment taking the form of \u201clicenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights\u201d must be \u201cconferred pursuant to domestic law\u201d to qualify for treaty protection, Respondent asserts that the assignment of SSA Cayman\u2019s rights derived from DIMAR Resolutions Nos. 0048 and 0354 to Claimant required DIMAR\u2019s authorization. Because such authorization was never granted, says Respondent, Claimant never acquired the associated rights in accordance with Colombian law, thus depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n202..\n\nMore precisely, Respondent frames this portion of its objection as one concerning a so-called legality requirement. It argues that, because DIMAR unquestionably has authority over underwater exploration insofar as further exploration is required, and because \u201cthe 1982 Confidential Report and the 2008 APA recognize that further exploration was required, SSA\u00a0LLC could not have been conferred SSA Cayman Islands\u2019 exploration rights without DIMAR\u2019s approval.\u201d286 Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s Predecessors knew that DIMAR\u2019s authorization \u201cwas necessary for the new holder to have the pertinent rights under Colombian law,\u201d as evidenced by their contemporaneous conduct.287 During the Hearing Respondent also argued (seemingly for the first time, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s question) that exploration rights granted pursuant to a DIMAR resolution are intuitu personae.288\n\nSubmission, \u00b6256; Reply, \u00b612.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6261-265; Reply, \u00b6275-281.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, slide 52; Tr. Day 2, 385: 10-18 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: And it\u2019s whether the rights granted under Resolution 48 are strictly linked to GMC Inc., the entity that requested the exploration rights, meaning whether these rights are *personal\u00edsimos* or *intuitu personae*. And we say that there is no doubt. They are intuitu personae. These rights were granted, as the relevant exhibit shows, [DIMAR Resolution No. 0048, 29 January 1980 (**C-2**)], only and specifically to GMC Inc., and they detailed very specific obligations for the exploring company.\u201d) See also Tr. Day 2, 392: 4-12 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: Second, we say the assignment of exploration rights by DIMAR is made *intuitu personae*. This means in a scenario where Resolution No. 48 is still in force, the transfer of exploration right would have still required DIMAR authorization. Additionally, in the present case, the authorization was necessary because there was a declared need to carry out further marine exploration for the purposes of identification of a particular shipwreck. That never changed.\u201d)\n\n203..\n\nClaimant, for its part, denies that the phrase \u201cconferred pursuant to domestic law\u201d amounts to a legality requirement,289 and underscores the absence in Respondent\u2019s pleadings of any reference to a provision of Colombian law that would support Colombia\u2019s position.290 Furthermore, Claimant submitted that Respondent \u201ccannot reasonably allege in view of the decisions of its own courts in 1994, 1997, 2007 and 2019 \u2013 that the underlying permits are somehow deficient under Colombian law.\u201d291\n\nResponse, \u00b6194.\n\nResponse, \u00b6202.\n\nResponse, \u00b6195, 204; Rejoinder, \u00b6218-219.\n\n204..\n\nThe Tribunal begins its inquiry with a consideration of Decree No. 2349 of 1971, by which DIMAR was established and which provides in relevant part at Arts. 3 and 4: 292\n\n**Article 3.** The functions or attributions of the General Directorate of Maritime and Port Authority are:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n17. To regulate, control and authorize the marine and coastal exploration and construction.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n21. To regulate and authorize the recovery of shipwrecked species.\n\n**Article 4.** The functions of the Director General are:\n\n5. To issue resolutions to:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(b) Authorize the activity and operation of foreign ships in Colombian waters and ports.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nd) Authorize the maritime and ports exploration, investigation, construction and exploitation.\n\nDecree No. 2349 of 1971, 3 December 1971 (R-1) (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n205..\n\nWhen asked during the Hearing what was \u201cthe legal basis or provision under Colombian law that requires DIMAR\u2019s authorization prior to the transfer of rights under Resolution No. 0048,\u201d Respondent pointed to its Submission wherein it referenced Arts. 3 and 4 of Decree No. 2349.293 Although by 2008 Decree No. 2349 was no longer in force, Respondent stated that DIMAR\u2019s authority had remained \u201cpretty much the same\u201d under Decree No. 2324 of 1984.294\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, slide 54; Tr. Day 2, 386: 15-25, 387: 1-8 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: For the next question, which is: What the legal basis or provision under Colombian law that requires DIMAR authorization prior to the transfer of rights under Resolution No. 48? And we have noted that Claimant have many times asserted that we have not come with any type of legal justification of why the transfer of DIMAR authorizations required also DIMAR authorization, and we say that we are surprised with that. Because since our Article 10.20.5 submission, we made clear that the basis for that is the fact that it is DIMAR pursuant to Decree 2349 of 1971, who regulates and authorized the recovery of shipwrecked species, that regulates and authorizes a recovery of shipwrecked species, the one that issued resolutions to authorize the activity and operation of foreign ships in Colombian waters, authorizes the maritime imports exploration, investigation, construction, and exploitation in Colombian sea beds. So, we think there is a clear basis for their request.\u201d)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, slide 55; Tr. Day 2, 388:1-7.\n\n206..\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal does not read Arts. 3 or 4 of Decree No. 2349 as requiring DIMAR\u2019s authorization for an intra-company assignment of rights and obligations (among which are the alleged rights derived from DIMAR resolutions on which SSA bases its claims). Their terms are much narrower. In particular, the Tribunal observes that DIMAR\u2019s competences, as well as those of its Director General, would appear to be circumscribed to authorizing activities that preceded Claimant\u2019s purported discovery of the San Jos\u00e9 in 1982 (i.e \u201c[t]o regulate, control and authorize the marine and coastal exploration\u201d, \u201c[a]uthorize the activity and operation of foreign ships in Colombian waters\u201d and \u201c[a]uthorize the maritime and ports exploration, investigation, construction and exploitation\u201d) or activities that have not yet been performed, such as the salvage of the San Jos\u00e9 (i.e. \u201c[t]o regulate and authorize the recovery of shipwrecked species\u201d). Indeed, it is undisputed that GMC Inc. requested and obtained authorization from DIMAR to transfer its rights to conduct underwater exploration activities in Colombian waters under Resolution No. 0048 to GMC in October 1980.295 This is consistent with DIMAR\u2019s overall role as the State agency in charge of regulating maritime activities in Colombian waters. By\u00a0contrast, the rights Claimant asserts derive from Resolutions Nos. 0048 and 0352 are, at their core, property rights over a treasure it claims to have already discovered as a result of past exploratory efforts. Thus, the proposition that the assignment of property rights derived from Resolutions No. 0048 and No. 0352 required DIMAR\u2019s authorization would seem to be inconsistent with the express terms of Arts. 3 and 4 of Decree No. 2349 and to go beyond the scope of DIMAR\u2019s mandate under Colombian law.\n\nAnswer, \u00b616; Submission, \u00b623; Response, \u00b631; Joint Chronology, p. 2 (item 6).\n\n207..\n\nFurthermore, Respondent acknowledged that, in this case, DIMAR\u2019s authorization was actually not required in respect of Resolution No. 0048 because that Resolution had already long expired by 2008.296 Respondent further submitted that Claimant would \u201cneed to come back to DIMAR in case marine exploration was still needed.\u201d297 In sum, Colombia has failed to establish that Decree No. 2349 required SSA Cayman to obtain prior authorization from DIMAR validly to transfer the rights derived from Resolutions Nos. 0048 and 0352 to Claimant.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, slide 56; Tr. Day 2, 386: 5-9 (\u201cMr. Vega-Barbosa: And the answer is pretty straightforward. The authorization by DIMAR was not necessary, but for a reason that is not associated with the nature, scope, and extent of DIMAR\u2019s competences, but with the fact that Resolution 48 has already expired.\u201d).\n\nTr. Day 2, 388: 12-13.\n\n208..\n\nIn the light of this conclusion, the question whether the issue of DIMAR\u2019s authorization pertains to the \u201clegality requirement\u201d is moot.298\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of \u201clegality\u201d typically is a ground for denying the existence of an \u201cinvestment\u201d only in the most serious of cases. *See, e.g.,* *\u00c1lvarez y Mar\u00edn Corporaci\u00f3n S.A. and others v. Republic of Panama*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/14, Final Award, 12 October 2018, \u00b6151-56 (**CLA-49**). *See also Vladislav Kim and others v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2017, \u00b6396, 406-08 (**CLA-39**).\n\n209..\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal is unable at this stage to agree with Colombia that the conduct of Claimant\u2019s Predecessors demonstrates their understanding that authorization as required for the transfer of rights under DIMAR resolutions.\n\n210..\n\nFirst, whether further marine exploration was required in 2008 is disputed between the Parties299 and cannot be decided at this stage.\n\nReply, \u00b6277; Tr. Day 2, 392: 8-12; Response, \u00b6201.\n\n211..\n\nSecond, what SSA\u2019s Predecessors\u2019 conduct indicates is their understanding that DIMAR\u2019s authorization is required when it comes to carrying out \u201cunderwater exploration operations\u201d300 or \u201cthe\u00a0 identification and rescue of the shipwreck\u201d301. Yet, even when Claimant\u2019s Predecessors needed to engage in such activities, they did not always seek DIMAR\u2019s prior authorization. As is apparent from GMC Inc.\u2019s request to DIMAR dated 9 September 1980, it informed DIMAR that it \u201chas assigned its submarine exploration rights [\u2026] to GMC\".302 Claimant\u2019s Predecessors\u2019\u00a0conduct does not support Respondent\u2019s contention that DIMAR\u2019s authorization was required for a general assignment of rights and obligations arising under DIMAR resolutions (especially if the assignee has no intention of engaging in marine exploration). As such, the conduct of Claimant\u2019s Predecessors confirms the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of Arts. 3 or 4 of Decree No. 2349, as explained above.\"\n\nRequest AF 01196877 from Glocca Morra Company Inc. to Dimar, 9 September 1980, p. 1 (**R-3**).\n\nConfidential Report on Underwater Exploration by Glocca Morra Company in the Caribbean Sea, Colombia, 26 February 1982, pp. 5-6 (**R-4**).\n\nRequest AF 01196877 from Glocca Morra Company Inc. to Dimar, 9 September 1980, p. 1 (**R-3**) (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n212. .\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent has failed to establish at this stage that Claimant\u2019s investment was not validly \u201cconferred pursuant to domestic law\u201d as per item (g) of the definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d in Article 10.28 of the TPA.\n\n*iii. Did DIMAR Resolutions no. 0048 and no. 00354 create in rem rights over any specific shipwreck?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213..\n\nIn its Reply303 Respondent contests Claimant\u2019s alleged investment because none of the relevant resolutions created any *in rem* rights.304 To support its point, Respondent refers to Resolution No. 173 of 1971 and No. 016 of 1974 (both mentioned in Resolution No. 0048 of 1980), by which DIMAR first recognized Reynolds Aluminium Europe S.A. \u201cas a claimstaker for the wreck called Capitana San Jos\u00e9\u201d, and then \u201cexpressly granted exploration rights to carry out underwater exploration activities over the very same shipwrecked species to another company, Friendship S.A.\u201d 305 According to Respondent: 306\n\n[T]he better view is thus that a resolution recognizing a private company as a reporter of treasures does not create any in rem rights over the reported species, much less to unreported species as in the case of Glocca Morra Company, but rather a mere expectation of a right, which is completely contingent on the reporter positively establishing that the reported species is in fact in the reported area, and moreover, on the State expressing its positive desire to extract the shipwrecked species.\n\nReply, \u00b6288-310.\n\nReply, \u00b6292-296.\n\nReply, \u00b6296-297; DIMAR Resolution No. 0048, 29 January 1980 (C-2) (Claimant\u2019s translation).\n\nReply, \u00b6298.\n\n214..\n\nThe problem with this particular argument is, first, that it is devoid of any form of support for this \u201cbetter view\u201d, and, second, that it is not at all clear why the fact that the rights in question may not be in rem is detrimental to Claimant\u2019s case. As noted by SSA, there \u201cis nothing in the TPA that requires SSA\u2019s rights to be in rem rights in order for them to be protected as an investment.\u201d307 Similarly, as noted above, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant\u2019s Predecessors possessed or were entitled to certain rights derived from the relevant resolutions, as confirmed by the 2007 CSJ Decision. While the nature and content of those rights are matters for the merits phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal has already concluded that Claimant had some form of right amounting to an \u201cinvestment\u201d in the sense of Article 10.28 of the TPA.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6222.\n\n215..\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s argument.\n\n(c) Conclusion\n--------------\n\n216..\n\nBased on the record as it currently stands, the Tribunal is simply unable to conclude at this stage, as Respondent asserts, that SSA is not an \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d or that the alleged investment did not reflect the characteristics of \u201cinvestment\u201d referred to in Art. 10.28 of the TPA. Considering in particular that the TPA does not contain language requiring an \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpersonal\u201d commitment on the part of an investor, and that the holding or acquisition of shares in a company,308 or rights arising from contracts309 have been held to amount to investments, the Tribunal cannot exclude at this juncture that Claimant also \u201cowns or controls\u201d a qualifying investment under Article 10.28 of the TPA or that such ownership or control could also satisfy the requirement that Claimant \u201cattempts through concrete action to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party\u201d, thus qualifying as an \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d within the meaning of Art. 10.28 of the TPA.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v.

Respondent \u201chas always held that [the 2007 CSJ Decision] conferred Claimant limited rights over a specific area located within specific coordinates.\u201d321 The fact that by virtue of the 2020 resolution Respondent proclaimed the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 (which was not within those specific coordinates, but rather, as Claimant argues, in their \u201cimmediate vicinity\u201d,322 and which Respondent itself discovered in 2015) an asset of national cultural interest is irrelevant.323\n\nSubmission, \u00b6173.\n\nResponse, \u00b610, 43, 49, 121.\n\nResponse, \u00b610, 43, 49, 121.\n\n224..\n\nSecond, Respondent considers that Resolution No. 0085 did not give rise to an \u201cindependent action\u201d that dispenses with analysis of pre-treaty conduct.324 On the contrary, any analysis of the legality of the Resolution No. 0085 \u201cwould necessarily and unavoidably require a finding going to the lawfulness of Colombia\u2019s decision to deny Glocca Morra Company any rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, judged against treaty commitments that were not in force at the time.\u201d325\n\nSubmission, \u00b6187-200.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6198.\n\n225..\n\nIn its Reply to Claimant\u2019s Response, Respondent submits that:326\n\n- The Tribunal is not required to assume the date of Claimant\u2019s \u2018impugned measure\u2019 as the sole relevant date for the ratione temporis analysis, contrary to Claimant\u2019s contentions (which are based on a misrepresentation of legal authorities).327 Nothing prevents Respondent from shedding light on the relevant facts, as necessary to prove that the alleged breach is in fact rooted in pre-TPA State conduct.328\n\n- Resolution No. 0085 is not only irrelevant but is not an independently actionable act. Neither case law,329 nor the facts of the case support Claimant\u2019s position that Resolution No. 0085 is an independently actionable act.330 Notably:331\n\no DIMAR never authorized GMC Inc. to search for the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9;\n\no The 1982 Report did not report the finding of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, and in fact shows that further exploration for the purposes of identification has always been necessary;\n\no Colombia has never recognized the alleged discovery of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 by Glocca Morra Company;\n\no Colombia expressly denied that the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 had been discovered by Glocca Morra Company by adopting the content of the 1994 Columbus Report; and\n\no Colombia\u2019s domestic courts did not vest SSA Cayman Islands with property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.\n\nReply, \u00b6317.\n\nReply, \u00b6320-325.\n\nReply, \u00b6325.\n\nReply, \u00b6330-337.\n\nReply, \u00b6338-342.\n\nReply, \u00b6340.\n\n226..\n\nAccording to Respondent, in order to assess the lawfulness of Resolution No. 0085, the Tribunal must necessarily evaluate the lawfulness of pre-TPA acts. It is impossible to assess the legality of Resolution No. 0085 vis-\u00e0-vis SSA without assessing first the legality of Colombia\u2019s pre-treaty acts through which any and all property rights Claimant may have had over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 were definitively denied.332 Even if one were to accept that it was not until the 2007 CSJ Decision that the legal status of SSA Cayman Islands vis-\u00e0-vis the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 was fully defined, the Tribunal would by force have to analyze whether the interaction between the 1994 Press Release, and the 2007 CSJ Decision, led to the absolute nullification of any property rights SSA Cayman Islands could have had over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9, as well as the legality of said measure.333\n\nReply, \u00b6346.\n\nReply, \u00b6348.\n\n227..\n\nEven if accepted as true, quod non, Respondent asserts that the alleged breaches were fully crystallized before the entry into force of the TPA. The evisceration of the alleged property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 was a fully consolidated situation.334 Even if the Tribunal were to consider that Claimant\u2019s situation was not fully consolidated with the 2007 CSJ Decision, it was undoubtedly consolidated by 7 December 2010, when the US Civil Action was filed before the DC District Court.335\n\nReply, \u00b6354.\n\nReply, \u00b6354.\n\n228..\n\nNeither the Tribunal nor Colombia are prevented from challenging Claimant\u2019s characterization of the relevant measures, which, in any case, does not constitute an attempt to recast Claimant\u2019s claims. Respondent is entitled to contest Claimant\u2019s factual characterization, especially when it is evident that Claimant\u2019s allegations are \u201ccompletely distorted and frivolous with the sole purpose of artificially establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d336\n\nReply, \u00b6365.\n\n2) Claimant's position\n----------------------\n\n229..\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s ratione temporis objection is unfounded because Claimant\u2019s claims arose eight years after the TPA came into effect.337 Notably, all of Claimant\u2019s claims arise from Resolution No. 0085 of 23 January 2020,338 which is not the \u201ccontinuation of\u201d any pre-TPA measures\u201d339 but rather an independently actionable breach (as acknowledged by Colombia).340 In any event, tribunals have rarely refused temporal jurisdiction on the basis that a separate post-treaty measure is not \u2018independently actionable\u2019 (i.e. is \u201cnothing but a mere continuation of a pre-TPA measure\u201d).341\n\nResponse, \u00b6210; Rejoinder, \u00b6227, 230.\n\nResponse, \u00b6215.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6243.\n\nResponse, \u00b6223-238; Rejoinder, \u00b6240-249.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6241.\n\n230..\n\nThe principal flaw in Respondent\u2019s objection, says SSA, \u201cis that it disregards the TPA\u2019s wording, which excludes from the Tribunal\u2019s purview, not \u2018disputes,\u2019 but \u2018measures\u2019 \u2018which ceased to exist before\u2019 the TPA\u2019s entry into force.\u201d342 Respondent\u2019s \u201cinsistence that the Tribunal should use the date of consolidation of \u2018Claimant\u2019s legal status\u2019 to assess its jurisdiction under Art. 10.1.3 has no textual, jurisprudential or, indeed, rational basis.\u201d343 As such, \u201cthe ratione temporis assessment must be pegged to the date of Resolution No. 0085 \u2013 i.e., the impugned expropriatory measure upon which Claimant\u2019s case is based \u2013 not any earlier date on which a broader dispute between the parties first arose.\u201d344 It is this resolution that \u201cfully expunged\u201d any of the rights in the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 that Claimant had been trying to enforce in Colombian, US and IACHR proceedings.345 It is this resolution that constituted \u201can arbitrary reversal in Colombia\u2019s position.\u201d346\n\nResponse, \u00b6218; Rejoinder, \u00b6229.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6239.\n\nResponse, \u00b6220.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6248.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6244.\n\n231..\n\nClaimant has not made any claims for relief arising from Respondent\u2019s actions before the date of Resolution No. 0085.347 According to Claimant, Respondent cannot point to any of its\u00a0measures predating the TPA that give rise to Claimant\u2019s claims.348 Claimant asserts that Colombia\u2019s pre-treaty acts are merely referenced in its submissions to provide factual context and explain the historic background of the impugned measures.349 Colombia\u2019s pre-treaty acts had no impact on the validity or content of Claimant\u2019s investment.350\n\nResponse, \u00b6216; Rejoinder, \u00b6230.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6230.\n\nResponse, \u00b6242.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6238.\n\n232..\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s argument raised that \u201cby virtue of the 1994 Columbus Press Release and its correspondence thereafter denying the existence of the shipwreck at the pinpoint coordinates in the 1982 Report, \u2018before Resolution No. 0085 SSA LLC had no[] property right whatsoever over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9\u2019\u201d misses the mark.351 First, Respondent\u2019s \u201cunilateral assertions that the San Jos\u00e9 was not at certain pinpoint coordinates had no impact whatsoever on the legal validity of SSA\u2019s rights to 50% of the treasure in the Discovery Area.\u201d352 Second, Claimant considers that the determination of the facts relating to what the Discovery Area contained and the value of what it contained at the time of the issuance of Resolution No. 0085 ought to be deferred to a subsequent stage of the proceedings.353\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6245.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6246.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6247.\n\n**3) Non-disputing position**\n-----------------------------\n\n233..\n\nThe US emphasized the rule against retroactivity, according to which \u201cunless the post-treaty conduct [\u2026] is itself capable of constituting a breach of the [treaty], independently from the question of (un)lawfulness of the pre-treaty conduct, claims arising out of such post-treaty conduct would also fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d354\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b69 *citing Astrida Benita Carrizosa v.

Costa Rica*,355 which would require it to determine whether: \u201c(i) the act that post-dates the treaty fundamentally changed the status quo of the claimant\u2019s investment; and (ii) such act is \u2018independently actionable\u2019, such that the \u2018alleged breach [can] be evaluated on the merits without requiring a\u00a0finding going to the lawfulness of pre-[treaty] conduct[.]\u2019\u201d356 In its Reply, Respondent argued that the Tribunal must determine: \u201c(i) whether the alleged breach is independently actionable, or whether it is rather necessarily linked to other acts of the State that took place before the date of the TPA\u2019s entry into force [\u2026]; (ii) whether the evaluation of the alleged breach entails the evaluation of the lawfulness of other pre-TPA State acts [\u2026]; [and] (iii) whether the alleged breach corresponds to a situation that ceased to exist or was fully settled before the date of the TPA\u2019s entry into force.\u201d357\n\nSpence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz, et al. v.

This assertion has been central to Respondent\u2019s pleadings throughout.\n\n237..\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, the factual issues relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination include the following:\n\n- \u201cWhat is the impugned measure?\n\n- Did Resolution No. 0085 occur after the TPA came into effect?\n\n- Is Resolution No. 0085 independently actionable?\u201d361\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal and Closing Statement, slide 5.\n\n238..\n\nSimilar to the factual issues raised with respect to the *ratione materiae* objection, the Tribunal notes that the factual submissions Respondent advanced at the Hearing in relation to its ratione temporis objection would require the Tribunal to dive deeply into matters that lie at the heart of the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute (e.g. the legitimacy of the Columbus Report, which is contested by Claimant;362 the relevance of references to \u201cGale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9\u201d or lack thereof in the 2007 CSJ Decision, etc.).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b614, 144, 258; Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, slides 51-52.\n\n239..\n\nThe Tribunal is, however, grateful to Respondent for having clarified and distilled the relevant legal issues to two principal questions, the first being whether \u201cthe date of [Claimant\u2019s] selected impugned measure is the only relevant date for the purposes of the ratione temporis analysis.\u201d The answer to this query depends on the relevant treaty language.\n\n240..\n\nThe legal framework relevant to Respondent\u2019s ratione temporis objection includes Articles 1.3 and 10.1 of the TPA, which provide:\n\n**Article 1.3: Definitions of General Application**\n\n***measure*** includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement, or practice;\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nArticle 10.1: Scope and Coverage\n\n1. This Chapter applies to **measures** adopted or maintained by a Party related to:\n\na) Investors of another Party;\n\nb) Covered investments; and\n\nc) With respect to Articles 10.9 and 10.11, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n3. For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to **any act or fact** that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n241..\n\nAs noted in Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia, a case brought under the TPA in which Colombia raised a similar argument to its plea in this case: \u201c[T]he text of the TPA\u00a0contains no temporal limitation with respect to disputes that may come under the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d [\u2026] Art. 10.1.3 of the TPA [\u2026] \u201cexcludes any pre-treaty \u2018act or fact\u2019, but is silent on pre-treaty disputes.\u201d363 As such, \u201cthe fact that the broader dispute concerning the alleged mistreatment of the Claimant\u2019s purported investment in Colombia may have arisen before the TPA\u2019s effective date does not mean that the TPA condoned Colombia\u2019s repeated mistreatment of the Claimant\u2019s investment after its entry into force.\u201d364\n\n*Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/5, Award,19 April 2021, \u00b6135 (**RLA-23**).\n\n*Astrida Benita Carrizosa v.

Republic of Peru* is likewise of assistance, given the identical wording of the relevant temporal provision in the applicable treaty. In that case, the tribunal emphasized the importance of the concept of \u201cmeasure\u201d365 and noted a \u201csignificant problem\u201d with respondent\u2019s argument: it did not conform to the treaty\u2019s actual wording.366 Considering the particular wording of the U.S.-Peru BIT, the tribunal held that \u201cthe relevant date for establishing temporal jurisdiction is [\u2026] not the date when an investment dispute arose, but the date when an impugned \u2018law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\u2019 was \u2018adopted or maintained\u2019 by the host State,\u201d367 and it is up to the claimant to identify the contested measure.368 In the tribunal\u2019s view, the contested measures constituted actionable breaches and could not \u201cbe excluded from the scope of protection of the Treaty merely because they are related to pre-Treaty acts and facts.\u201d369\n\n*Gramercy Funds Management LLC, Gramercy Peru Holdings LLC v.

Republic of Peru noted:373\n\n[\u2026] in order not to pass judgment on the lawfulness of conduct predating the entry into force of the Treaty, **the allegedly wrongful conduct postdating the entry into force of the Treaty must \"constitute an actionable breach in its own right\" when evaluated in the light of all of the circumstances, including acts or facts that predate the entry into force of the Treaty.** On this essential reading of both Mondev and Berkowitz, the Parties and the US would seem to agree.374\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*The Renco Group, Inc. v.

Republic of Colombia tribunal, \u201cif post-treaty conduct can constitute an independent cause of action under the treaty, it will come under the treaty tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, **irrespective of whether such conduct may pertain to a broader pre-treaty dispute**\u201d375 (emphasis added). Put differently, \u201cunless the post-treaty conduct [\u2026] is itself capable of constituting a breach of the TPA, **independently from the question of (un)lawfulness of the pre-treaty conduct**, claims arising out of such post-treaty conduct would also fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added).376\n\n*Astrida Benita Carrizosa v.

Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/5, Award, 19 April 2021, \u00b6153 (**RLA-23**).\n\n248..\n\nThough the Tribunal is aided by the reasoning of the *Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia* tribunal, it diverges on the conclusion. Notably, in *Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia*, the tribunal upheld the objection because, *inter alia*, claimant\u2019s response to the tribunal\u2019s question did not \u201cpoint to an independent allegation raised against the 2014\u00a0Order,\u201d rather it \u201ccorroborate[d] that the proceedings ending with the 2014 Order necessarily called for a finding about the lawfulness of the 2011 Decision.\u201d377\n\n*Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/5, Award, 19 April 2021, \u00b6161 (**RLA-23**).\n\n249..\n\nBased on the current state of the record, that does not appear to be the case here. During the Hearing, Claimant\u2019s counsel persuasively argued that Resolution No. 0085 was the first act taken by Colombia that purportedly had the effect of negating any rights that SSA or its Predecessors may have had, *even if Colombia were to recognize Claimant\u2019s discovery of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9:*\n\nMR. MOLOO: We\u2019re not asking this Tribunal to rule on the conformity of pre-treaty acts or even acts that happened longer than three years ago. Those facts are here because they\u2019re relevant factual background to the dispute that\u2019s before this Tribunal. But ultimately the dispute and what we are alleging is the measure that breached the TPA in this particular case is, of course, **Resolution No. 85, because that is the measure that for the first time \u2013 if you go to the next slide \u2013 for the first time says it doesn\u2019t matter if you found the San Jos\u00e9. Because even if you found it, it is cultural patrimony. It \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 none of it is treasure. So you get 50 percent of zero. That\u2019s the first time that they say even if it\u2019s the San Jos\u00e9, you get zero. It\u2019s the first time that the government takes a measure that eviscerates our legal rights**.[\u2026] the day before the January 23, 2020 resolution, did we think we had rights? And the answer is: of course we did. [\u2026] In our submission, this is not a continuation of a situation that was already crystallized as Colombia puts it. Because never before had our legal rights been eviscerated. Never before had Colombia said, You \u2013 if you found the San Jos\u00e9, if that\u2019s what was at \u2013 they said you didn\u2019t find the San Jos\u00e9. But that\u2019s a different point. That\u2019s a factual dispute. They never said that the legal rights to which you had, whatever it is that\u2019s at that \u2013 at that reported coordinates. [\u2026] In those coordinates, you get zero of it because it\u2019s all cultural patrimony. So there may have been a factual dispute about did we find it, did we not find it. But this is the first time where even if we did find it, we get zero.378\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nTr.

Whatever Colombia\u2019s conduct over the years may have been, whatever Claimant or its Predecessors may have believed about the effects of that conduct on its rights, at this stage, Resolution No. 0085 appears to have been something else entirely. Respondent itself is unable to disagree. For the purposes\u00a0of this preliminary phase, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent that Resolution No. 0085 was not \u201cindependently actionable\u201d.\n\n252..\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal is comforted by the fact that, on their face, the most recent judgments of the Colombian courts on the matter of the San Jos\u00e9 appear to recognize that as *late* as 2019 Claimant (or its Predecessors) possessed certain rights.380 What those rights are, need not be decided now. At this juncture, the Tribunal need only \u201cdetermine *prima* facie whether a treaty breach could have occurred if the Claimant is able to substantiate its claim on the merits in further proceedings.\u201d381\n\n10th Civil Court of the Circuit of Barranquilla, Judgment, 6 July 1994 (**C-25**); 10th Civil Court of the Circuit of Barranquilla, Judgment, 12 October 1994 (**C-26**); Superior Court of the Judicial District of Barranquilla, Case File No. 20.166, Judgment, 7 March 1997 (**C-27**); Superior Court of the Judicial District of Barranquilla, Judgment, 29 March 2019 (**C-39**).\n\n*The Renco Group, Inc. v.

Claimant expressly admitted that the alleged breaches had crystallized, and the damage had already perfected by 7 December 2010.390 In 2010 Claimant stated that Colombia was exercising dominion and control over its chattels and that it had allegedly deprived it of its possessions.391 Since 2010, Claimant had certainty of the damage or loss it could have incurred due to the alleged breach, and had in fact quantified said damage between USD 4 billion and USD 17 billion.392\n\nb. On Claimant\u2019s own account, the alleged expropriation took place on 26 November 2012, \u201cwhen, in bad faith, Colombia rejected the access to the shipwreck in any form\u201d.393\n\nc. Claimant also argued, before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, that the Government allegedly treated it unjustly and discriminatorily before 18 December 2019.394\n\nd. At several instances between 2015 and 2018, Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged unlawful expropriation and resulting damage.395 This is because:\n\ni. In a letter of 20 May 2015, Claimant expressly conceded that it knew that \u201cColombia only recognized property rights on the basis of the 2007 CSJ Decision in respect of assets located in the precise coordinates stated in the 1982 Confidential Report, where no shipwreck was identified.\u201d396  \nii. On 5 December 2015, the President of Colombia publicly announced that an archaeological site corresponding to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 had been found.397 By way of this announcement, \u201cColombia attempted to cast doubt on GMC\u2019s\u00a0location for the San Jos\u00e9 and claimed that it had found the shipwreck at different coordinates than those reported by GMC\u201d.398\n\niii. On 17 June 2016, in response to Claimant\u2019s letter, the Ministry of Culture made clear that Claimant had no rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.399\n\niv. On 30 November 2016, the Minister of Culture reiterated Colombia\u2019s long-standing position denying Claimant any rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.400\n\nv. On 5 January 2018, the Ministry of Culture sent a letter to Claimant, stating it had no rights whatsoever over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 since its predecessors had not found it.401\n\nSubmission, \u00b6211.\n\nReply, \u00b6375, 386, 399-405.\n\nReply, \u00b6400.\n\nReply, \u00b6402.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6213-214;

and (ii) by 17 June 2019, Claimant had certainty of the loss incurred.405 Furthermore, Claimant\u2019s argument that, both in respect of the Presidential announcement of 5 December 2015 and the communication from the Vice President of the Republic of Colombia of 17 June 2019, Colombia refused to allow Claimant to visit the site to confirm the location of the shipwreck Colombia found in 2015, are clear admissions of Claimant\u2019s knowledge prior to 18 December 2019.406\n\nReply, \u00b6423-429.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6222.\n\nReply, \u00b6424.\n\nReply, \u00b6428.\n\nSubmission, \u00b6224;

MOLOO: In my submission, the question that's critical for this Tribunal is to ask--and as I think we all agreed is when is it that we knew that we lost our rights? And when is it that we knew that we had definitively suffered the loss that we are claiming in this arbitration as a result of the measure that is being impugned? No matter all of the stuff that happens in the reports is moot in my submission, because ultimately after that we have discussions with the Colombian Government, but critically, critically, in March 2019, the Superior Court reinstates an injunction that confirms our rights. And in correspondence, it's clear that we understand--understand that our rights had not been permanently deprived, which is under international law the test for expropriation. Not only are we saying that we don't think our light--our rights had been permanently deprived, but the Colombian courts are saying that. [\u2026]437\n\nTr. Day 1, 281: 7-23, 282: 22-25, 283: 1-24.\n\n273..\n\nIndeed, based solely on the face of the judgment in question it appears that, when reinstating the Injunction Order on 29 March 2019, the Court of Appeals held that the lifting of the Injunction Order had caused harm to the Plaintiff as it was \u201cdepriving [it] of the only tool it has at its\u00a0disposal to enforce the 1994 and 1997 judgments, due to the failure to perform an action that is not in its power to perform.\"438\n\nSuperior Court of the Judicial District of Barranquilla, Judgment, 29 March 2019, p. 6 (C-39) (Claimant\u2019s translation).\n\n274..\n\nAs noted in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis on Respondent\u2019s ratione temporis objection, what those rights may have been and whether the 2019 judgment (and the other judgments referenced therein) pertained to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 need not be determined in this preliminary stage. They are quintessentially issues that fall for determination at the hearing of the merits.\n\n275..\n\nAs appears from the Parties\u2019 \u201cJoint Chronology of Key Facts,\u201d the only other communication from Colombia between the date of Court of Appeals judgment (29 March 2019) and Resolution No. 0085 (23 January 2020), is the letter of the Vice-President of Colombia, through which he:\n\na. \u201cinformed [SSA] that the verification of the coordinates reported in 1982 was already performed through Contract No. 544 of 1993, whose results allowed to conclude that \u2018in the coordinates reported by Glocca Morra Company (today Sea Search) there is NO shipwreck, much less any trace of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 Only a piece of wood was found at the site, which after being examined, led to the conclusion that it did not belong to any shipwreck;\u2019\n\nb. reminded SSA that it \u2018holds no right over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 or its content because it is not located at the coordinates reported by that company;\u2019\n\nc. confirmed that \u2018the coordinates reported by Maritime Archaeology Consultants Switzerland (MACS) do not correspond to those reported by Glocca Morra Company and do not overlap with these coordinates.\u2019\u201d439\n\nLetter from the Vice-President of Colombia to SSA, 17 June 2019 (**C-40**) (Claimant\u2019s translation); Joint Chronology, p. 32 (item 100).\n\n276..\n\nThis letter, however, could not have triggered the limitation period. Over the course of the Parties\u2019 \u201crelationship\u201d, multiple letters have been exchanged and, in between those exchanges, Colombian courts rendered judgments that appear to have recognized to Claimant (or its Predecessors) certain rights. Assuming that the circumstances were indeed such that Claimant (or its Predecessors) were periodically reassured of its (their) rights by Colombian courts, it would lead to an absurd result to hold that Claimant knew or should have known of the \u201cbreach alleged\u201d and the \u201closs incurred\u201d before 18 December 2019 (and the Tribunal was not provided with any legal authority that would enable it to conclude that way). The Tribunal recalls here Claimant\u2019s submission during the Hearing:\n\nPRESIDENT DRYMER: I don't know what your friends will say tomorrow, but presumably it will be something along the lines that the prescription clock started to tick--the three-year clock started to tick--the moment you said we believe we've been permanently deprived.\n\nMR. MOLOO: And I would say as of 2019, we did not think we were permanently deprived.\n\nPRESIDENT DRYMER: No, but beforehand you did. [\u2026] Whatever happened afterwards, the clock had started to tick four years earlier.\n\nMR. MOLOO: And I think it is--again, as I say, I think it's somewhat irrelevant. Because if you go and say: \"Hey, I've been permanently deprived,\" and later on the court said--which is an organ of the state--says: \"No, no, no, you haven't been.\" Then you go: \"Oh, okay. Good. I haven't been. Vice-President, I'm going to now enforce my rights\"; right? So, I don't see--because then, what that basically means is--if you have recognized rights by the State, they can now expropriate them without any recourse. Because I thought I had been expropriated ten years ago, and I'd made a mistake, but you know what? They're saying: \"No, you now have these rights\"--but, forever and always, I can never now enforce those rights that the Court is recognizing ever again. So, that just can\u2019t be, in my view.440\n\nTr. Day 1, 285: 14-25, 286: 1-16.\n\n277..\n\nAt this stage, and on the record as it currently stands, the Tribunal is swayed by Claimant\u2019s argument. Respondent\u2019s *ratione voluntatis* objection is dismissed.\n\n**V. COSTS AND SECURITY FOR COSTS**\n-----------------------------------\n\nA. RESPONENT'S POSITION\n-----------------------\n\n278..\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal exercise the discretion granted to it under Art. 10.20.6 of the TPA and award Respondent \u201creasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection,\u201d given the frivolity of Claimant\u2019s claims.441\n\nSubmission, \u00b6272, 282, 283, 287; Letter from Sea Search Armada, LLC to Colombia\u2019s Shipwrecked Antiquities Commission, 24 August 2015 (R-25); Letter from Sea Search Armada, LLC to the Minister of Culture, 19 November 2015 (R-27); Free Trade Agreement between Colombia and United States, Section 10, 22 November 2006 (RLA-6).\n\n279.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent seeks security for costs. In its view, the frivolity of Claimant\u2019s claims and the reasonable \u2013 and feasible \u2013 possibility that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections will succeed, coupled with the fact that Claimant has no assets in Colombia against which an order of costs could be enforced and that it is being aided by a third-party funder should prompt the Tribunal to exercise its authority under Art. 26(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and order Claimant to provide security for costs in the amount of no less than USD 800,000 pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction.442\n\nSubmission, \u00b6288; Reply, \u00b6466-486; Email from Gibson Dunn to the Tribunal, 21 September 2023 (R-39); Email from Gibson Dunn to the Tribunal, 9 October 2023 (R-40). The amount stated in Respondent\u2019s Submission was USD 300,000 (see \u00b6290).\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n280..\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s assertion that Claimant\u2019s claims are \u201cblatantly frivolous\u201d lacks merit because: (i) it is premised on the idea that Claimant chose to initiate the arbitration instead of abandoning its rights, which is not a basis for an adverse costs order; and (ii) it is based on a severely distorted representation of the relevant facts; and lacks any legal basis. Considering Respondent\u2019s \u201cmeritless\u201d jurisdictional objections and its blatant and repeated mischaracterization of Claimant\u2019s case and the facts in pursuit of its aims, Claimant therefore seeks an order of costs against Respondent.443\n\nResponse, \u00b6286.\n\n281..\n\nWith respect to security for costs, Claimant considers Colombia\u2019s request to be patently deficient since it lacks \u201cconcrete evidence that security for costs is necessary or urgent here\u201d or that \u201cSSA is unable or unwilling to pay adverse costs,\u201d and as such must be rejected.444\n\nResponse, \u00b6290; Rejoinder, \u00b6267.\n\n**C. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**1)** **Costs**\n----------------\n\n282..\n\nClaimant is clearly \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d in this phase of the arbitration. Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections under Art. 10.20.5 of the Treaty have been dismissed in their entirety.\n\n283..\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion under Art. 10.20.6 and generally under Art. 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal reserves the issue for a future decision, order or award.\n\n**2)** **Security for Costs**\n-----------------------------\n\n284..\n\nIn the circumstances, Respondent\u2019s request for security for costs \u201cpending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction,\u201d based as it is on the alleged risk that SSA may not be able to satisfy an award of costs against it, is moot.\n\n285..\n\nThis does not preclude Respondent from advancing a similar request during a subsequent phase of the proceedings. In the event that it elects to do so, however, the Tribunal hopes that Colombia will bear in mind that security for costs is not ordered lightly and that exceptional circumstances must generally be present.445 Without deciding the matter, the Tribunal notes\u00a0that such circumstances are not particularly evident from the Parties\u2019 submissions and pleadings to date, nor is it evident that the contingency fee arrangement between Claimant and its counsel and/or the confidential general financing facility to which counsel\u2019s law firm is a party amount to \u201cthird party funding\u201d.\n\n*Sergei Paushok et al. v.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present Decision comprises the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on Claimant\u2019s *Application for Interim Measures* dated 16 April 2024, brought under Article 10.20.8 of the TPA and Article 26 of the applicable UNCITRAL Rules (the \"**Application**\").1\n\nApplication, \u00b61.\n\n2.\n\nAs discussed below, Claimant requests the Tribunal to issue a series of orders - including an order for urgent, temporary relief pending a decision on the Application itself - intended to assure the preservation and protection of \"evidence arising out of and related to [the] planned salvage of the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck.\"\n\n**II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL CONTEXT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 19 March 2024, in view of certain media reports that seemed to imply that Colombia planned to commence salvage operations related to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 very shortly, Claimant wrote to Respondent to request that Colombia:2\n\na. Provide SSA with a written undertaking describing the measures that it has implemented and plans to implement to ensure that the items from the San Jos\u00e9 galleon\u2019s shipwreck are preserved, protected from dissipation and accurately recorded and catalogued upon extraction (\"Evidence Preservation Protocol\");\n\nb. Take all actions necessary to implement the Evidence Preservation Protocol; and\n\nc. Report to Claimant on a monthly basis the progress of any extractions from the shipwreck, alongside detailed records of the extracted objects.\n\nApplication, \u00b69; Response, \u00b67; **Exhibit C-124**, Letter from SSA to Colombia, 19 March 2024.\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 April 2024, Respondent reverted stating that \"the Republic of Colombia maintains its position that SSA, LLC has not proven, and cannot prove, any particular right over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9\" and that \"Claimant has not yet established the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in these proceedings.\"3\n\nApplication, \u00b610; Response, \u00b69; **Exhibit C-125**, Email from Colombia to SSA, 8 April 2024.\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 April 2024, Claimant filed its Application, together with factual exhibits (C-121 through C-125)and legal authorities (CLA-93 through CLA-97).4\n\nResponse, \u00b610.\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 April 2024, the Tribunal requested Respondent\u2019s response to the Application by 24 April 2024. On the same date, Respondent requested additional time in order to provide its views on the Application.\n\n7.\n\nOn 18 April 2024, Claimant indicated its willingness to agree to Respondent\u2019s request on the condition that \"Respondent provides by 24 April 2024 *\"a written undertaking confirming that it is preserving, protecting from dissipation, and accurately recording and cataloguing any Evidence it recovers from the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck until such time as this Tribunal has rendered its decision regarding SSA\u2019s Interim Measures Application\"* (Application, para. 44).\" Later that day, Respondent indicated it would conduct internal consultations and revert promptly.\n\n8.\n\nBy email dated 19 April 2024, Respondent offered the following clarifications and representations to the Tribunal and Claimant which, it said, \"effectively address the concerns raised by Claimant, facilitating the withdrawal of [Claimant\u2019s Application]\":5\n\nFirst, Claimant\u2019s Requests are based on an incorrect factual premise. Contrary to what Claimant argues, Colombia will not conduct (and is not planning to conduct)any archeological excavation (let alone extraction)at the archaeological context of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in the next months. In an effort of good faith and cooperation, Colombia hereby clarifies that the multidisciplinary scientific research project involving the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 is merely in its early stages. Colombia hereby represents that, in the first year, no archaeological excavation is planned nor foreseen. Moreover, no schedule of activities for the recovery of archaeological materials has even been prepared.\n\nColombia notes that C-122, which Claimant cherry-picks from C-121, does not support Claimant\u2019s position. Simply put, Colombian Navy Captain Escobar did not say that any planned expedition to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 was aimed at the extraction of any objects. This is because, in fact, the initial actions regarding the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 will be non-intrusive and do not require nor involve material collection.\n\nSecond, needlessly to say, and as Colombia already stated during the Hearing on Preliminary Objections, the State is taking and will continue to take the necessary measures to protect and preserve the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 and, particularly, any archeological materials, in compliance with the Colombian Constitution and - already existing and applicable - Colombian laws and regulations for the protection of archeological heritage.\n\nResponse, \u00b616; **Exhibit R-45**, Email from Respondent to Claimant\u2019s counsel, 19 April 2024.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal immediately invited Claimant to respond, which it did on the same date. SSA noted in particular that (i)the statements and representations in Respondent\u2019s 19 April 2024 email seemed to contradict public statements by Colombian officials; and (ii)Respondent \"still has not offered a written undertaking to protect and preserve evidence consistent with its obligations under international law.\" SSA indicated its willingness to confer with Respondent in the hopes of resolving the Parties\u2019 differences, while maintaining its Application in the meantime.6\n\nSee also Response, \u00b617.\n\n10.\n\nOn 20 April 2024, noting the possibility of continued discussions between the Parties, the Tribunal granted Respondent until 3 May 2024 to respond to Claimant\u2019s Application in the event that the matter could not be resolved amicably before then.\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 April 2024, Respondent sought to \"further [reassure] Claimant that: (i)no extraction or retrieval of items from the San Jos\u00e9 was to take place in the upcoming months, and (ii)the Evidence, if obtained, would be subject to the highest levels of conservation and protection considering Colombia\u2019s constitutional and statutory obligations.\"7\n\nResponse, \u00b618; **Exhibit R-47**, Email from Respondent to Claimant\u2019s counsel, 23 April 2024 (\"Colombia confirms that it will not conduct (and is not planning to conduct)any intervention in the coming months. Colombia also reaffirms that every stage of this scientific research project is governed by Constitutional and legal provisions mandating the highest levels of conservation and protection.\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 25 April 2024, Claimant reverted, noting its willingness to withdraw its Application if Respondent provided the Tribunal with the following undertaking:8\n\nthe Republic of Colombia (\"Colombia\" or \"Respondent\")hereby undertakes to (i)**inform** Sea Search-Armada LLC (\"SSA\" or \"Claimant\")**at least 60 days in advance of any exploration, studies, interventions, recordings** (video, audio or of any other kind), **scientific research project, extraction, salvage, or recovery of any items or artifacts in and around the wreckage of the San Jos\u00e9 Galleon of any kind**, regardless of their scale and scope (\"Activity\"), including, for the avoidance of doubt, items in the vicinity of the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck, along with a detailed description of the measures Colombia plans to undertake to ensure that the Activity (or Activities)is properly documented **and** (ii)**preserve, protect from dissipation and accurately record and catalogue any items salvaged from the San Jos\u00e9 Galleon's shipwreck during Colombia's Activity (or Activities).**\n\nRespondent further acknowledges that Claimant reserves all rights to file or re-file an Interim Measures Application if Claimant deems it to be warranted by the circumstances.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\nResponse, \u00b619; **Exhibit R-48**, Email from Claimant\u2019s counsel to Respondent, 25 April 2024.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 April 2024, Respondent refused Claimant\u2019s proposal.9\n\nResponse, \u00b620; **Exhibit R-52**, Email from Respondent to Claimant\u2019s counsel, 29 April 2024.\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 May 2024, Respondent filed its *Reply to Sea Search Armada LLC\u2019s Application for Interim Measures,* together with factual exhibits (R-42 through R-52)and legal authorities (RLA-54 through RLA-81)(\"**Response**\").\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 May 2024, Claimant filed a *Reply to the Republic of Colombia\u2019s Response to Claimant\u2019s Application for Interim Measures,* together with factual exhibits (C-122bis, C-126 through C-132)and legal authority CLA-98 (\"**Reply**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 10 May 2024, Respondent requested leave to respond to Claimant\u2019s Reply, which the Tribunal granted later that day.\n\n17.\n\nOn 14 May 2024, Respondent filed a *Sur-Reply to Sea Search Armada LLC\u2019s Reply on Interim Measures,* together with factual exhibits (R-53 through R-57)and legal authorities (RLA-82 through RLA-84)(\"**Rejoinder**\").10\n\nWhen it invited Colombia to comment on SSA's Reply, the Tribunal erroneously referred to that further submission as a \"sur-reply\" as opposed to a \"rejoinder\". That terminological error is corrected here, where the term \"Rejoinder\" is used.\n\n**III. APPLICABLE TREATY PROVISIONS AND RULES**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\n**Article 10.20.8 of the TPA** empowers the Tribunal to:\n\norder an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.\n\n19.\n\n**Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules** provides in relevant parts as follows:\n\n[...]\n\n2. An interim measure is any temporary measure by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party, for example and without limitation, to:\n\n(a)Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;\n\n(b)Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, (i)current or imminent harm or (ii)prejudice to the arbitral process itself;\n\n(c)Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied; or\n\n(d)Preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute.\n\n3. The party requesting an interim measure under paragraphs 2 (a)to (c)shall satisfy the arbitral tribunal that:\n\n(a)Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and\n\n(b)There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal in making any subsequent determination.\n\n4. With regard to a request for an interim measure under paragraph 2 (d), the requirements in paragraphs 3 (a)and (b)shall apply only to the extent the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate.\n\n[...]\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of the following provisions of the TPA:\n\n**Article 10.21: Transparency of Arbitral Proceedings**\n\n[...]\n\n(3)Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to disclose protected information or to furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 22.2 (Essential Security)or Article 22.4 (Disclosure of Information).\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Article 10.28: Definitions**\n\nProtected information means confidential business information or information that is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under a Party\u2019s law.\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Article 22.2: Essential Security**\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed:\n\n(a)to require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure of which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests; or\n\n(b)to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Article 22.4: Disclosure of Information**\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to confidential information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.\n\n**IV. SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------\n\n**A)Claimant's Application**\n----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nAs suggested very briefly above, Claimant\u2019s Application was prompted by a number of media reports to the effect, for example, that \"Colombian authorities have recently reinitiated plans to salvage the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck\" (reports which had already been foreshadowed by Respondent\u2019s counsel during the hearing on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA in December 2023), as well as reports that the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck has already been tampered with, if not looted.11 Claimant points to a statement of a Colombian Naval Captain in late February 2024 that an expedition will be carried out to the location of the shipwreck in \"June, July or August.\"12 According to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s \"planned salvage operation will give rise to important evidence regarding, *inter alia,* the value of the shipwreck,\"13 which makes its preservation critical for the purposes of the present arbitration.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b62, 7, 22, 30.\n\nApplication, \u00b68; **Exhibit C-121**, Interview of Captain Germ\u00e1n Escobar, Bluradio Colombia, 23 February 2024; **Exhibit C-122**, Transcript of Interview of Captain Germ\u00e1n Escobar, Bluradio Colombia, 23 February 2024.\n\nApplication, \u00b62.\n\n22.\n\nIn its Application, Claimant requests that the Tribunal make the following orders (\"**Requested Measures**\"):14\n\nOrder Colombia to submit a written undertaking to the Tribunal and Claimant describing the measures that it has implemented and plans to implement to ensure that any Evidence is preserved, protected from dissipation, and accurately recorded and catalogued in the form of a draft Evidence Preservation Protocol;\n\nOrder Colombia to report to the Tribunal and the Parties on a bi-monthly basis on the progress of any Evidence recovered from the shipwreck and on the implementation of the Evidence Preservation Protocol;\n\nOrder Colombia to implement the Evidence Preservation Protocol with due care and to promptly notify the Tribunal and Claimant of any departures from or violations of the Evidence Preservation Protocol whether by Colombia or third parties; and\n\nOrder Colombia to pay the full costs of this Application.\n\nApplication, \u00b643; Reply, \u00b649.\n\n23.\n\nThe \"**Evidence**\" to which the Requested Measures are directed is defined in SSA\u2019s Application as including:15\n\nAny and all objects or artifacts identified, recovered or salvaged as part of Colombia\u2019s expedition(s)to the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck, including any information on their condition;\n\nA log of the coordinates at which any and all objects or artifacts are identified, recovered or salvaged as part of Colombia\u2019s expedition(s)to the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck;\n\nAny and all recordings or records (including visual recordings, sound recordings, electromagnetic readings, sonar readings, written records, etc.)during and resulting from the exploration and salvage expedition(s)conducted by Colombia (including notes taken by Colombian Navy and government officials and any private company involved in the operation); and\n\nAny and all records, registration, catalogue, classification, study, memorandum, summary, or any similar documents, written or otherwise, related to the identification or salvage and subsequent handling of any identified or recovered object or artifact from the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b619, 21.\n\n24.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Article 26(4)of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes a particular standard for interim measures that are aimed at preserving evidence, as opposed to other types of objectives.16 Nonetheless, even if the Tribunal were to consider all of the various requirements for an order of interim measures that are listed in Article 26(3), it ought to conclude that they have been met since: \"(i)the Requested Measures aim to preserve evidence that is relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute; (ii)if that evidence is not preserved, Claimant is likely to suffer harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages; (iii)the harm Claimant is likely to suffer substantially outweighs any harm to Colombia; (iv)there is a reasonable possibility that Claimant will succeed on the merits of its claims; (v)temporary relief is warranted pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Application.\"17\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b617-18.\n\nApplication, \u00b618.\n\n25.\n\nWith respect to the first requirement (item (i)in the preceding paragraph), Claimant submits that the Evidence to be created in the context of \"Colombia\u2019s identification and recovery of the San Jos\u00e9 galleon\u2019s artifacts\" is directly relevant and material to the present arbitration. That Evidence, it says, will *inter alia,* allow a more accurate categorization and valuation of the shipwreck and treasure over which Claimant asserts that it has rights.18 That Evidence will also be solely within Colombia\u2019s possession, custody and control.19\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b619-20.\n\nApplication, \u00b621.\n\n26.\n\nWith respect to the second requirement (item (ii)in the list above), Claimant\u2019s argument is two-fold. Considering that \"the preservation of evidence is inherently critical to maintain the integrity of the proceedings,\" \"requests for the preservation of evidence do not require the same showing of severity of harm as other requests for provisional measures.\"20 In any case, failing to grant Claimant\u2019s Application will \"likely result\" in \"harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages\" because: (a)\"the estimation of [Claimant\u2019s] damages could be impacted by the very Evidence SSA seeks to preserve via the Requested Measures;\" and (b)Respondent refused to give assurances otherwise.21\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b623-26.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b627-31.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Claimant, although the Tribunal need not compare the harm that is likely to result to SSA if the Application is not granted with the harm that is likely to result to Respondent if it is granted (item (iv)in the list above), considering that preservation of evidence is not subject to the same showing of severity of harm as other sorts of measures, if the Tribunal were to compare the two harms, it would find in Claimant\u2019s favour.22 In Claimant\u2019s view, it is unclear that any harm would be caused to Respondent if the Application were granted, because the Application merely seeks to \"confirm that Colombia is doing what it has told the Tribunal is its 'main concern\u2019 - the preservation of the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck and its associated items and artifacts.\"23 Notwithstanding that Respondent would actually be in violation of the domestic injunction order that has been in place since 199424 if it were to salvage or extract items from the galleon, the Requested Measures do not seek to restrain Respondent from proceeding with the extraction altogether; they would simply establish a protocol for the preservation of evidence that is \"transparent, accountable, and fair\".25\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b632-35.\n\nApplication, \u00b633.\n\nApplication, \u00b634; **Exhibit C-26**, 10th Civil Court of the Circuit of Barranquilla, Judgment, 12 October 1994; **Exhibit C-76**, Superior Court of the Judicial District of Barranquilla, Judgement, 23 June 1995; **Exhibit C-27**, Superior Court of the Judicial District of Barranquilla, Case File No. 20.166, Judgment, 7 March 1997;

**Exhibit C-39**, Superior Court of the Judicial District of Barranquilla, Judgment, 29 March 2019.\n\nApplication, \u00b634.\n\n28.\n\nNeither, says SSA, is the T ribunal required to find that Claimant has a \"reasonable possibility\" of success on the merits in the context of a request for interim measures aimed at the preservation of evidence (item (iv)in the above list).26 Nonetheless, if the Tribunal considers that factor, Claimant submits that it has unquestionably satisfies the requirement.27\n\nApplication, \u00b636.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b637-38.\n\n29.\n\nLastly, considering that Respondent may, in SSA\u2019s words, \"substantially advance its planned salvage operations\" while Claimant\u2019s Application is pending, Claimant also requests that the Tribunal issue \"temporary relief with immediate effect, ordering Colombia to provide a written undertaking confirming that it is preserving, protecting from dissipation, and accurately recording and cataloguing any Evidence it recovers from the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck until such time as this Tribunal has rendered its decision [on the Application].\"28\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b641, 44.\n\n**B)Respondent's Response**\n---------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the Application \"is nothing more than a badly disguised document production request, in an attempt to access the coordinates where the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 is located.\"29 According to Respondent, the Application is premised on a \"panoply of misleading assertions and [...] misrepresented information\" and fails to meet any of the cumulative requirements provided for in Article 10.20.8 of the TPA and Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules.30 By granting the Application the Tribunal would prejudge the merits of the case because it would provide Claimant with more rights than it ever possessed.31 The Application should thus be dismissed in its entirety, with Claimant bearing all costs related thereto.32\n\nResponse, \u00b62.\n\nResponse, \u00b63.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b635-37.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b61, 3, 5, 161.\n\n31.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent argues that no temporary relief is warranted pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Application because: (i)\"the factual premise of [the Application] (i.e., the extraction of items from the San Jos\u00e9 Galleon as soon as June 2024)\" is erroneous; and (ii)Respondent has already assured Claimant that it will not conduct any intervention in the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck in the upcoming months. Any intervention over the San Jos\u00e9 Galleon will be publicly announced and any evidence obtained will be \"subject to the highest levels of conservation and protection.\"33\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6157-158.\n\n32.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has the authority to order interim measures, it is not unfettered, and interim measures should not be granted lightly.34 Rather, as the Tribunal in *Zeph Investments v. Australia* noted, interim measures can only be granted if five cumulative criteria are fulfilled: \"(i)*prima facie* jurisdiction of the tribunal over the dispute; (ii)reasonable possibility of success of the requesting party\u2019s case on the merits; (iii)necessity, i.e., the requested measure must be necessary to prevent the requesting party from suffering harm or prejudice that is likely to occur and not susceptible to being adequately repaired by an award of damages; (iv)urgency, i.e., the actions susceptible of causing harm or prejudice must be likely to occur before the award is issued; (v)proportionality, i.e., the harm or prejudice likely to be inflicted on the requesting party must substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to the Respondent if the interim measure is granted.\"35\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b623-27.\n\nResponse, \u00b628.\n\n33.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Article 26(4)of the UNCITRAL Rules \"does not undermine in any way Claimant\u2019s burden of proving that the Requested Measures comply with those requirements.\"36 Indeed, Claimant failed to demonstrate that the Requested Measures are necessary, urgent and proportional.37\n\nResponse, \u00b639.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b628-34.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Requested Measures are not necessary to prevent irreparable harm because:38\n\na. The facts underlying the Application have no basis. Claimant grossly misconstrued the statements of Respondent\u2019s counsel made during the hearing on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20(5)of the TPA. When read in context and in good faith, it is evident that Respondent\u2019s counsel indicated that \"the relevant authorities would conduct a scientific evaluation to ensure a responsible extraction, 'if any,\u2019 from the San Jos\u00e9\" (emphasis in the original).39 Similarly, \"Captain Escobar merely referred to the activities that are being conducted in preparation to carry out the campaigns, which are the incursions to the site that are going to be made with an eminent scientific purposes,\" which again \"do not involve any extraction or retrieval of items from the San Jos\u00e9.\"40 Finally, the news articles regarding the alleged tampering with the San Jos\u00e9 provide no evidence of any alleged looting.41\n\nb. \"[I]n the current *status quo* of the San Jos\u00e9 Project no extraction or retrieval of items from the Gale\u00f3n is being planned.\" The San Jos\u00e9 Project was presented to the public in late February 2024 at a symposium in Cartagena (which Claimant could have attended but decided not to).42 The San Jos\u00e9 Project is \"a multidisciplinary scientific investigation,\" one of the principal goals of which is \"to evaluate the threats to which the archaeological site and the operation are subject to, with the purpose of eliminating or mitigating them.\"43 The first phase of this project concerns \"all the administrative and technical processes for the authorization of research activities and institutional coordination in accordance with Article 4 of Law 1675 of 2013.\"44 The second phase will include the analysis of the information collected \"about the shipwreck and the environmental conditions where it is located.\"45 At present, \"there is not even a schedule of activities regarding an eventual extraction of items since there is no certainty of any extraction even taking place.\"46\n\nc. Compulsory constitutional and other legal provisions require Colombia to protect the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9. These include Articles 8, 63 and 72 of Colombia\u2019s Political Constitution of 1991, Article 4 of Law 357 of 1997, Articles 4 and 5 of Law 1675 of 2013, Articles 2.7.1.4.6 and 2.7.1.4.7 of Decree 1080 of 2015, as well as various provisions of criminal and disciplinary laws (e.g. Articles 239, 240, 241 (13), and 269-1 of the Criminal Code).47\n\nd. Respondent has not only disproven the evidence provided by Claimant, but has also \"unequivocally proven that the Evidence is subject to a special protection regime under Colombian law, which renders the Requested Measures moot and unnecessary.\"48\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b647-107.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b654-56.\n\nResponse, \u00b661.\n\nResponse, \u00b665-74.\n\nResponse, \u00b680.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b681, 85.\n\nResponse, \u00b679.\n\nResponse, \u00b686.\n\nResponse, \u00b685.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b689-105.\n\nResponse, \u00b6107.\n\n35.\n\nNeither are the Requested Measures urgently required to prevent irreparable harm because \"no extraction or retrieval of items from the San Jos\u00e9 has even been planned.\"49 Respondent explains that the first campaign scheduled for 2024 is aimed at determining the feasibility of any extraction; as such, it does not foresee any \"planned excavation or extraction.\"50\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6108-114.\n\nResponse, \u00b6111.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to Respondent, granting the Application would impose a disproportionate burden upon Colombia because it would \"require Colombia to disclose protected information in terms of Article 10.21(3)of the TPA, granting SSA access to information it is not allowed to access under Colombian law.\"51 Article 10.21(3)of the TPA provides that \"[n]othing in this Section [Investment] requires a respondent to disclose protected information or to furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 22.2 (Essential Security)or Article 22.4 (Disclosure of Information).\"52 \"Protected information\" is defined at Article 10.28 as \"confidential business information or information that is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under a Party\u2019s law.\"53 The information to which the Requested Measures pertain fall within that definition, especially in light of Article 17 of Law 1675 of 2013, Article 4(1)of Decree 204 of 2022, Article 2.7.1.3.12 of Decree 1080 of 2015 and Article 5.5.1.7 of Resolution 0192-2020 of DIMAR.54 Thus, granting the Application would not only \"compromise Colombia\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority to protect and preserve San Jos\u00e9 as part of its cultural heritage, but it would also oblige Colombia to act against its own laws relating to the confidentiality of information produced by - or in the custody of - public entities.\"55\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6115-136.\n\nResponse, \u00b6122.\n\nResponse, \u00b6123.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6125-131.\n\nResponse, \u00b6117.\n\n37.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent considers that Claimant has no reasonable possibility of succeeding on the merits of the claim.56 Claimant failed to identify \"a single document which recognizes its purported property rights over the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.\"57 The fact that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA was made on a *prima facie* basis and that the Tribunal underscored Claimant failed to request \"a positive finding of jurisdiction\" further supports Respondent\u2019s position.58\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6137-142.\n\nResponse, \u00b6139.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6140-141.\n\n38.\n\nFinally, \"if the Tribunal were to order the Requested Measures, it would imply a clear pre-judgment of the case\u2019s merits, specifically on one of the issues that has been mainly disputed between the parties, which is whether SSA has any right whatsoever over the San Jos\u00e9.\"59 An order which \"specifically involve[s] the San Jos\u00e9 and any information over the artifacts of the shipwreck, would be a clear pre-determination of the content of Claimant\u2019s right, which as the Tribunal itself stated is a matter 'for the merits phase of the proceedings\u2019.\"60\n\nResponse, \u00b6146.\n\nResponse, \u00b6151.\n\n**C)Claimant's Reply**\n----------------------\n\n39.\n\nClaimant reiterates in its Reply that, per Article 26(4)of the UNCITRAL Rules, in the context of requests under the preservation of evidence prong of the UNCITRAL Rules, Article 26(3)requirements need to be fulfilled \"only to the extent the Tribunal considers appropriate.\"61 In Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s reliance on *Zeph Investments v. Australia\u2019s* five prongs is inapposite because the tribunal in that case expressly stated that the claimant sought \"neither the preservation of assets [...] nor the preservation of evidence.\"62\n\nReply, \u00b615.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b616-17.\n\n40.\n\nNonetheless, says SSA, even if the Tribunal were to apply the five criteria from *Zeph Investments v. Australia* it would find in favour of Claimant because: (i)the Evidence is relevant and material to the present proceedings (which Respondent does not appear to contest)63; (ii)the failure to preserve Evidence will likely cause harm not adequately reparable by an award (which Respondent appears to contest in part)64; (iii)the balance of harms weighs in favor of granting the Application; (iv)Claimant has a reasonable probability of success on the merits (Respondent does not appear to challenge the applicable standard)65; (v)an interim order by the Tribunal would not pre-judge the merits of this arbitration; and (vi)temporary relief is warranted pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Application.66\n\nReply, \u00b620.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b622-23.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b642-43.\n\nReply, \u00b619.\n\n41.\n\nClaimant further submits that while Respondent did not contest that the \"harm caused by the destruction and dissipation of evidence cannot be compensated by damages,\"67 it did contest the \"likelihood\" of this occurring, importing \"necessity\" and \"urgency\" requirements that are external to the relevant provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules.68\n\nReply, \u00b622.\n\nReply, \u00b623.\n\n42.\n\nEven on the basis of the standard advocated by Colombia, however, SSA says that the Application should be granted. The Requested Measures are necessary because: (i)Respondent is indeed contemplating an extraction mission that would likely be completed before President Gustavo Petro leaves office in 2026 (whether it be labelled as \"scientific\", \"research\", \"technical\" or \"training\" is immaterial);69 (ii)Respondent provided no evidence \"to disprove public reports and criminal complaints about the tampering and looting of the site\"70 nor to \"counter observations made by several underwater archeologists that the site has already been manipulated;\"71 (iii)\"[w]hatever rules and standards may exist under Colombia\u2019s law for the protection of underwater cultural patrimony, those standards protect neither SSA\u2019s interests in this dispute nor the integrity of these proceedings.\"72\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b625-27.\n\nReply, \u00b628.\n\nReply, \u00b631.\n\nReply, \u00b633.\n\n43.\n\nThe Requested Measures are urgent, says SSA, because Respondent\u2019s representations to it and to the Tribunal are contradicted by the statements of its officials that \"the extraction of materials from San Jos\u00e9 has begun or will begin shortly\" and that the salvage of the wreck will occur by 2026.73\n\nReply, \u00b635.\n\n44.\n\nThe balance of harms weighs in Claimant\u2019s favour because: (i)the Requested Measures do not require Respondent \"to disclose the Evidence at issue (yet), but merely to take measures to preserve it;\"74 (ii)Respondent can still suggest alternate language to \"the only Requested Measure Respondent appears to take issue with based on its supposed confidentiality concerns\" which is that it \"report to the Tribunal and the Parties on a bi-monthly basis on the progress of any Evidence recovered from the shipwreck;\"75 (iii)\"to the extent that Respondent seeks to protect information from disclosure [...] it needs to provide particularized information as to which specific document(s)this would apply to, on what grounds, and whether such information can be redacted.\"76\n\nReply, \u00b638.\n\nReply, \u00b639.\n\nReply, \u00b640.\n\n45.\n\nClaimant also reiterated that its \"case is eminently reasonable assuming the alleged facts are proven during the merits phase.\"77\n\nReply, \u00b643.\n\n46.\n\nGranting the Application would not pre-judge the merits because Claimant, in its word, \"is not seeking a determination of its rights or of its claims on the merits, or indeed on the nature of its rights to the San Jos\u00e9, but quite simply the preservation of the Evidence that is central to the Tribunal\u2019s ability to resolve this dispute and make a reasonable determination of the quantum, should SSA prevail on the merits.\"78\n\nReply, \u00b645.\n\n**D)Respondent's Rejoinder**\n----------------------------\n\n47.\n\nAfter reiterating that \"interim measures are not to be granted lightly,\" that the party requesting them bears \"the burden to prove that the situation is such as to warrant an order for interim relief,\" and that the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion under Article 26(2)(a)\"does not mean that Claimant is somehow relieved from the obligation to provide conclusive evidence [that] the requirements [under Articles 26(3)(a)and (b)] are met,\"79 Respondent submitted that 7 out of 8 factual exhibits that Claimant had filed with its Reply were \"completely new\" and that \"none of those exhibits provide conclusive evidence to support the applicable legal standard.\"80\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b62-3.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b65.\n\n48.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"exhibits C-122bis, C-126, C-127, C-128 and C-132 should not be given great evidentiary weight\" as they are \"simply news articles allegedly reporting the saying of Colombia\u2019s public officials in a clearly imprecise, incomplete, and misleading fashion.\"81 Rather, the latest and official statement on this matter came from the Ministry of Cultures on 14 May 2024 when it clarified that no intrusive activities are contemplated in the initial phase of the San Jos\u00e9 Project.82 Respondent\u2019s views on the substance of Exhibits C-130 and C-131 is expressed in its Response.83\n\nRejoinder, \u00b610; see also Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b65-9.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b611; **Exhibit R-56**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 14 May 2024.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b666-73.\n\n49.\n\nFinally, in Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s Application is \"unreasonable and unacceptable\". On the one hand, the request made on 25 April 2024 is \"far more intrusive [than the Application] since it requires Colombia to inform SSA, at least 60 days in advance, not only of interventions regarding the extraction of items but 'of any exploration, studies, intervention, recordings\u2019 from the scientific research project,\" which significantly encroaches on Colombia\u2019s sovereign rights.84 Due to the early stages of the San Jos\u00e9 Project (which will be launched in Cartagena on 22 May 2024 and which will still be in the early stages in the second half of this year), Respondent cannot commit to a preservation protocol.85\n\nRejoinder, \u00b617.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b618, 23, 24.\n\n50.\n\nOn the other hand, Colombia recalls that Claimant maintains the request for relief stated in its Application which presupposes a disclosure of a log of coordinates where the artifacts are identified, recovered or salvaged.86\n\nRejoinder, \u00b619.\n\n51.\n\nIf, however, Claimant is merely requesting the preservation of Evidence and not its disclosure, then the Requested Measures are neither necessary nor urgent in Colombia\u2019s view, given that: (i)it has in place strong constitutional and statutory protections regarding its submerged cultural heritage; (ii)it has put in place a scientific project that seeks to protect all of the information related to the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9; and (iii)it will constantly be informing, consulting and updating the public regarding the San Jos\u00e9 Project (as it has done to date).87 In sum, says Respondent, \"Colombia already has the duty to preserve [the Evidence], and furthermore, every action taken related to the San Jos\u00e9 Project will be shared with the public, which includes SSA.\"88\n\nRejoinder, \u00b621.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b625.\n\n**V. DISCUSSION**\n-----------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s authority to order interim measures is not contested.89 There also appears to be no disagreement regarding the general importance of preserving potentially relevant and material evidence.\n\nApplication, \u00b612; Response, \u00b623.\n\n53.\n\nThat being said, Respondent has emphasized throughout its submissions that interim measures are extraordinary and should not be ordered lightly.90 While the Tribunal agrees with that general sentiment, it finds that in the present case the Application is well-founded, as explained below.\n\nSee, e.g., Response, \u00b624; **Exhibit RLA-51**, *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v.

It is not necessary for the Tribunal to look beyond the clear words of the UNCITRAL Rules. In particular, Respondent has not made out a case, and the T ribunal is in no way persuaded, that it is necessary or appropriate in this case to apply to an interim measure under paragraph 26(2)(d)concerning preservation of evidence, the requirements in paragraphs 26(3)(a)and (b)of the UNCITRAL Rules concerning wholly different types of measures. It rather seems axiomatic that evidence that may be relevant and material ought to be preserved.\n\nApplication, \u00b634.\n\nApplication, \u00b616.\n\n55.\n\nThe multiple authorities filed by the Parties that concern interim measures of a different nature than those requested here are of little assistance. Among those is the decision on interim measures in *Zeph Investments Pte. Ltd. v. The Commonwealth of Australia,* which features prominently in Respondent\u2019s submissions as \"one of the few cases where the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as in force as of 2021)have been applied in a decision on interim measures\"93. As pointed out by Claimant,94 however, that case did not concern the preservation of evidence, but rather \"measures to maintain or restore the *status quo,* and to prevent [Australia] from taking actions likely to cause current or imminent harm to [Zeph Investments] or prejudice the arbitral process.\"95\n\nResponse, \u00b628.\n\nReply, \u00b617.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-65**, *Zeph Investments Pte. Ltd. v. The Commonwealth of Australia I,* PCA Case No. 2023-40, Procedural Order No. 2 on Claimant\u2019s Interim Measures Application, 17 November 2023, \u00b612.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the following statement by the tribunal in *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea* to be instructive:96\n\nIn this regard, in deciding whether to grant provisional measures, tribunals also generally look to **the nature of the provisional measures that are requested**, and the relative injury to be suffered by each party. **While some provisional measures** (such as, for example, preserving the *status quo* and ordering performance of a contract or other legal obligation)**typically require a strong showing of serious injury, urgency and a** ***prima facie*** **case, other provisional measures (such as preservation of evidence, enforcement of confidentiality obligations)are often unlikely to demand the same showings.**\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit CLA-95**, *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, 21 January 2015, \u00b6113. In a similar vein, the tribunal in **Exhibit CLA-97**, *Ipek Investment Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/18/18, Procedural Order No. 5, Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, 19 September 2019, \u00b615, recognized that different categories of provisional measures \"engage[] distinct considerations\".\n\n57.\n\nThis makes perfect sense in the Tribunal\u2019s view.\n\n58.\n\nCertain interim measures under the Rules (e.g., measures *to maintain* or *restore* the status quo (Art. 26.2(a), *to take action* or *refrain from taking action* so as to ensure that that no harm is caused (Art. 26.2(b), or *to preserve assets* (Art. 26.2(c)), measures which effectively order a party to act or refrain from acting in a particular manner, often in order to protect a right claimed by another, do require showings of harm, proportionality, and a *prima facie* case on the merits.\n\n59.\n\nThe preservation of evidence differs from most of those sorts of measures. Preserving evidence is not undertaken for the sake of a right claimed by particular party, but seeks rather to protect and preserve the purpose of the proceedings themselves. Moreover, measures to preserve evidence fall squarely within the Tribunal\u2019s overarching authority and responsibility to ensure that the arbitration is conducted fairly and efficiently, and in a manner to allow each party to present its case (Art. 17(1)), including with respect to the taking of evidence (Art. 27)It makes sense that an order to preserve evidence should not necessarily demand the same showings as certain other measures; and in fact, the UNCITRAL Rules state clearly that it does not - *unless* a Tribunal considers it appropriate to require such showings in the light of the particular circumstances of the case before it, which is not the case here.\n\n60.\n\nMultiple media reports have been produced which demonstrate the fluidity of the current state of affairs and the uncertainty concerning the actual timeline and consequences of any \"investigations\" of the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck. Claimant understandably fears that extraction of items from the shipwreck is potentially imminent. Respondent on the other hand contests the legitimacy of Claimant\u2019s concerns, emphasizing the early stage and the exploratory character of the so-called San Jos\u00e9 Project. It is impossible to be certain on the face of the record that either party is absolutely correct to take the position it does. The challenge for the T ribunal is to determine what if any measures are appropriate in such circumstances to protect both the Parties and these proceedings against what the Tribunal considers is the possible loss of potentially important evidence.\n\n61.\n\nUltimately, and even on the face of Respondent\u2019s exhibits, the Tribunal cannot but recognize that there exists an important measure of uncertainty as to the nature, scope and timing of the Project and of its potential impact on matters central to this arbitration. Whilst this uncertainty is perhaps both legitimate and understandable in the circumstances, given the Project, the fact of it cannot be ignored.\n\n62.\n\nFor example, in December 2023 it was reported that as of February 2024 relevant authorities would debate on the future of Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in order to \"ensure the adequacy of the processes\":97\n\nTo achieve this purpose, in 2024 the archaeological site will be characterized, the research project will be formulated and mechanisms for the conservation analysis of materials will be established.\n\nThis year will also be key for the formation of a team of specialists that will be in constant contact with academia and national and international research centers. In this sense, **the first meeting will be held in February 2024, as an invitation from the Minister of Cultures, Arts and Knowledge, Juan David Correa, to broaden the debate on the future of the galleon, to ensure the adequacy of the processes**.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit R-50**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 14 December 2023 (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n63.\n\nA February 2024 press release expanded on the Government\u2019s plans to make significant investments during 2024 in equipment necessary for the \"recovery of objects\" and other infrastructure, providing also a timeline for the \"scientific investigation\" (second semester of 2024):98\n\nThe scientific investigation of the San Jos\u00e9 Galleon is a highly complex project to be carried out in the deep waters of the Colombian Caribbean. The preparation and execution of the project consists of the following components.\n\n[...]\n\n**5. Robotics and electronics:** will lead the aspects related to the adequacy and operation of the ROV to carry out archaeological exploration in deep waters and the recovery of objects**.**\n\n[...]\n\n**During the year 2024, the Colombian State will invest 17,962 million pesos, which include the strengthening of its technical capacity with the adaptation of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV)**, which will be directed from the multipurpose vessel ARC \"Caribe\", which has dual capabilities (scientific and research development)and the conditions that the robot needs to descend to great depths, without losing stability.\n\n**During this year, investments will also be made in the existing infrastructure of the** ***Centro de Investigaciones Ocean\u00f3graficas e Hidrogr\u00e1ficas del Caribe*** **-CIOH, of the DIMAR, laboratory equipment will be purchased** and some spaces will be adapted to have the technology and supplies required by the project's researchers, with emphasis on the stabilization of materials.\n\n**The scientific research, which is expected to begin in the second half of this year**, will also require operational and logistical training.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit R-42**, Press release of the Ministry of Cultures \"As\u00ed ser\u00e1 la investigaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica sobre el hallazgo del gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9\", 23 February 2024 (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n64.\n\nOn 5 March 2024 it was reiterated that:99\n\n**The first exploration campaign, which is estimated for the beginning of the second half of this year**, will also require operational and logistical training.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit R-51**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 5 March 2023 (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n65.\n\nA further update followed on 19 March 2024, which referred to the Government\u2019s plans to make investments to adapt a laboratory for the \"conservation of materials\":100\n\nIn light of the latest facts and reports on alleged irregular interventions in the discovery of the San Jos\u00e9 galleon, the Government of Colombia informs:\n\n[...]\n\nDuring the development of the research project to be carried out in 2024, the analytical and control parameters on the area of the Asset of Cultural Interest of the San Jos\u00e9 Galleon will be reviewed, in order to determine the state of hydrographic.\n\n**In this 2024, the Colombian State will invest 17,962 million pesos, which include:**\n\na). The strengthening of technical capacity with the adaptation of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), from the multipurpose vessel ARC \"Caribe\".\n\nb). **The adaptation of a materials conservation laboratory** in the facilities of the Caribbean Oceanographic and Hydrographic Research Center of the General Maritime Directorate.\n\nc). A permanent process of scientific divulgation and dissemination to multiple interested publics.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit R-43**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 19 March 2024 (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n66.\n\nOn 14 May 2024, while stating that the investigation is still in its early stages, the Ministry of Cultures noted that later phases could include the collection of archaeological materials and sampling:101\n\n**Subsequent phases** of investigation will depend on the results of this first stage of characterization and **may include collection of archaeological materials, sampling**, conservation activities and specialized analysis, among others.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit R-56**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 14 May 2024 (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal infers from the signature of an agreement between the *Ministerio de las Culturas, las Artes y los Saberes,* the *Ministerio de Defensa* and the *Instituto Colombiano de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia* (ICANH)that the San Jos\u00e9 Project may last for at least 5 years.102 This is, however, juxtaposed with an article filed by Claimant (the accuracy of which Respondent contests)103 which refers to Colombia\u2019s intentions \"to recover the wreck before [President Gustavo Petro\u2019s] term ends in 2026.\"104\n\n**Exhibit R-51**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 5 March 2023 *(\"This Monday, Colombia took a new step in the research project for the discovery of the San Jos\u00e9 galleon: the signing of the framework agreement between the Ministry of Cultures, Arts and Knowledge, the Ministry of Defense (through its executing entities: the Colombian Navy and the General Maritime Directorate - DIMAR)and the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History - ICANH.*  \n*This means that the signatory entities have committed during the next five years to make available the financial, physical, technical, administrative and other resources needed to develop all the activities required for the scientific research project on the San Jos\u00e9 galleon, as well as other studies on submerged cultural heritage in Colombian waters.\"* (Respondent\u2019s translation)).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b610.\n\n**Exhibit C-126**, Jim Wyss, \"Colombia Accelerates Plan to Recover Billions in Sunken Treasure,\" Bloomberg, 3 November 2023.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes due and respectful note of Respondent\u2019s counsel\u2019s representations that the San Jos\u00e9 Project is in its early stages,105 and that Colombia \"will not conduct (and is not planning to conduct)any intervention in the coming months.\"106 Nonetheless, even when added to the evidence submitted by Colombia, that does not entirely dissipate what we refer to above as the fluidity and uncertainty surrounding the Project and its potential impact on the arbitration, such as to justify a dismissal of Claimant\u2019s Application or render the Requested Measures moot.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b685, 111.\n\n**Exhibit R-47**, Email from the Respondent to Claimant\u2019s counsel 23 April 2024.\n\n69.\n\nThe Application concerns not only items that are \"recovered\" or \"salvaged\" from the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck, but also items that are \"identified\". The term \"Evidence\" as defined at paragraph 19 of the Application includes any object \"identified, recovered or salvaged,\" as well as different types of recordings which do not presuppose an actual extraction (or \"recovery\" / \"salvage\")of items. Thus, the statement of 14 May 2024 that \"the initial phase of the project of investigation of Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 will be exploratory and does not contemplate intrusive actions\" is of limited assistance to Respondent\u2019s attempt to rebuff the Application.107 Indeed, this article states that:\n\nIn this sense, and taking into account that due to the type of contexts studied and the methods and techniques used, archaeological investigations take time and are slow. Therefore, this roundtable established the first steps to be taken in the characterization phase of the discovery of the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9:\n\n[...]\n\n2. Recording: **the images collected help to build an inventory of the archaeological evidence on the seabed**. This will allow a classification of the materials and their origin.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit R-56**, Ministry of Cultures, Press release, 14 May 2024 (Respondent\u2019s translation).\n\n70.\n\nPer Article 17(1)of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal is bound to conduct the proceedings in a manner that \"avoid[s] unnecessary delay and expense and provide[s] a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties\u2019 dispute.\" It would amount to an inefficient use of the Parties\u2019 and the Tribunal\u2019s resources if the requests outlined in the Application were to be debated every so often whenever a potential \"intervention\" is suspected.\n\n71.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the San Jos\u00e9 Project may be in its early stages, or that (as noted above)Colombia will not \"conduct [...] any intervention in the coming months,\"108 does not prevent Respondent from committing to an Evidence Preservation Protocol (contrary to what Respondent argues).109 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, practically speaking, knowing that it has an Evidence Preservation Protocol to respect for purposes of the present proceedings may in fact assist Respondent to craft approaches and to choose and apply methodologies that allow for seamless compliance with such a Protocol.\n\n**Exhibit R-47**, Email from the Respondent to Claimant\u2019s counsel 23 April 2024.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b618.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal is comforted by the representations of Respondent\u2019s counsel that Colombia \"is taking and will continue to take the necessary measures to protect and preserve the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9.\"110 On that basis, and in view of Respondent\u2019s submissions and supporting evidence, this Decision should therefore impose a fairly limited practical burden on Respondent beyond that to which it says it is subject in any event under its own constitutional and legislative regime. Stated differently, the burden effectively imposed by this Decision would seem to arise to the extent that it requires measures to record and preserve evidence in a manner and form appropriate for purposes of this case that may not be identical to the substantial measures which Colombia says that it intends to take in any event.\n\n**Exhibit R-45**, Email from Respondent to Claimant\u2019s counsel, 19 April 2024.\n\n73.\n\nConsidering moreover the clarifications and *caveats* below, the Tribunal is not persuaded that by granting the Application it would be requiring Respondent \"to act against its own laws relating to the confidentiality of information produced by - or in the custody of - public entities.\"111\n\nResponse, \u00b6117.\n\n74.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider that by granting the Application it would be affecting a \"fundamental change to [the *status quo],* by improving the Claimant\u2019s situation,\" as was the case in the *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic* decision relied on by Respondent.112\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b636, 145; **Exhibit RLA-67**, *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Decision on Provisional Measures, 6 April 2007, \u00b637.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious of Respondent\u2019s assertion that \"Claimant is seeking to access documents and information prematurely, despite there being a specific phase in these proceedings in which the parties can request the production of documents.\"113 That is not, however, the result of the present Decision (and indeed as emphasized by Claimant114). While an interim order for the preservation of evidence may \"[ensure] that both [p]arties have an equal ability to exercise their right to seek the production of relevant documents,\"115 the Parties here are assured that the Tribunal is not making any determination at this time with respect to production of documents or the allocation of the burden of proof. Rather the Tribunal is merely endeavouring to preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the case and that accordingly may be subject to production - questions that the Parties will have the opportunity to address in due course.116\n\nResponse, \u00b6113.\n\nReply, \u00b638.\n\n**Exhibit CLA-97**, *Ipek Investment Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/18/18, Procedural Order No. 5, Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, 19 September 2019, \u00b6111.\n\nAt such time, the Tribunal will consider as necessary the provisions of Articles 10.21(3), 10.28, 22.2(a)and 22.4 of the TPA.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of Respondent\u2019s concern about producing to Claimant, or otherwise disclosing, a \"log of the coordinates at which any and all objects or artifacts are identified, recovered or salvaged as part of Colombia\u2019s expedition(s)to the San Jos\u00e9 shipwreck,\" which is one of the components of \"Evidence\" that Claimant seeks to have the Tribunal preserve.117 While the Tribunal considers it essential that these coordinates be accurately recorded and preserved, as will be seen below, the Tribunal is not ordering in this Decision that those coordinates be disclosed. Again, that question will be addressed should it be raised in due course in the context of the arbitration.\n\nApplication, \u00b619.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make clear that this Decision is in no way to be read as signifying any lack of confidence in any measures that Respondent has adopted or may adopt to protect and preserve the Gale\u00f3n San Jos\u00e9 in accordance with its domestic regime, nor of course any uncertainty regarding its compliance with such measures. The present Decision is issued in the context of this arbitration, for purposes of this arbitration, under the terms of the particular Treaty and Rules applicable to this arbitration, with a view to preserving the rights of the disputing parties as claimed (and still to be determined)in this arbitration, by preserving evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute in this arbitration.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal also wishes to emphasize that it is mindful of the confidentiality provisions of the TPA contained in Articles 10.21, 10.28, 22.2 and 22.4 noted in section III (\"Applicable Treaty Provisions and Rules\")above, which it takes very seriously. The Tribunal clarifies that the information resulting from this Decision and the Evidence Preservation Protocol, as explained below, is protected by those confidentiality provisions subject as may be the case to a decision of the Tribunal in respect of the application of such provisions or, as noted, the matter of production of documents and evidence, should such questions be raised in due course in this arbitration.\n\n79.\n\nLastly, considering the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions as set out below, and in reliance on the representations and good faith of Respondent and its counsel, the Tribunal considers that Claimant\u2019s request for \"temporary relief with immediate effect\" is uncalled for at this juncture.\n\n**VI. DECISION and ORDER**\n--------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Application is granted, in the following terms and manner:\n\na. The Parties shall attempt to agree on terms of an Evidence Preservation Protocol, including an accurate catalogue of the Evidence, along the lines of, though not necessarily identical to, the Requested Measures set out in the Application, and shall revert to the Tribunal with any agreement within one week of the date of this Decision.\n\nb. In the event that an agreement is reached and the Tribunal so notified by that date, the agreement will be incorporated into a Supplementary Decision and Order for an Evidence Preservation Protocol to be issued by the Tribunal.\n\nc.
