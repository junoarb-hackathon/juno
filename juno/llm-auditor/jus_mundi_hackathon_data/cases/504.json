Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 16 October 2008, Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B.V., companies incorporated in the Netherlands, filed at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") a Request for Arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. On 30 October 2008, the Centre registered the Request.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in this proceeding by the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in New York, New York. Since 29 January 2009, the Respondent is represented in this proceeding by the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP in New York, New York and Mexico City.\n\n3.\n\nNo agreement having been reached between the parties on the method of constituting the Tribunal, and more than sixty days having elapsed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration, by letter of 31 December 2008, the Claimants invoked Article 37(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n4.\n\nBy the same letter, the Claimants reiterated their appointment, as arbitrator, of Mr. Robert B. von Mehren, a national of the United States, whose appointment had initially been mentioned in the Request for Arbitration. Mr. von Mehren accepted his appointment, and on 11 February 2009, signed a Declaration and furnished a Statement pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6. His Declaration, Statement and *Curriculum Vitae* were transmitted to the parties by the Centre on 12 February 2009.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 20 February 2009, the Respondent appointed Professor Georges Abi-Saab, a national of Egypt. Professor Abi-Saab accepted his appointment, and on 2 March 2009, signed a Declaration pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6. His Declaration was transmitted to the parties by the Centre on 3 March 2009.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal not having been constituted within 90 days since the registration of the Request for Arbitration, by letter of 21 May 2009, the Claimants requested the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council as provided for in Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.\n\nThe Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council has appointed Judge Gilbert Guillaume, a national of France, as the President of the Tribunal. Judge Guillaume accepted his appointment and on 7 July 2009, signed a Declaration pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6. His Declaration was transmitted to the parties by the Centre on 3 November 2009. All of the arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Tribunal was constituted on 6 July 2009.\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 July 2009, having consulted with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal fixed the first session to take place on 16 November 2009, at the Paris offices of the World Bank. On the same day, the parties were invited to confer and advise the Tribunal, by no later than 16 October 2009, of any points of the session's provisional Agenda on which they are able to reach agreement. The parties were also invited to notify the Tribunal of any other items that they would like to see included in the Agenda.\n\n9.\n\nOn 3 September 2009, the Claimants filed a request for provisional measures. On 26 October 2009, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants' request for provisional measures. The Tribunal, by letter of 30 September 2009, from the Centre, informed the parties that their positions on the request for provisional measures would be heard at the first session.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of 21 September 2009, the Respondent requested \"supplemental information and clarification concerning the exact nature of Mr. von Mehren's relationship with Debevoise [& Plimpton LLP], who \"is acting as counsel to Holcim Ltd. in a case against the Republic [of Venezuela], which was registered by ICSID on 10 April 2009 as Case No. ARB/09/3.\"\n\n11.\n\nMr. von Mehren provided a response to the above request by letter of the same date.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 15 October 2009, the Respondent requested \"further clarifications regarding certain aspects of Mr. von Mehren's relationship with Debevoise.\"\n\n13.\n\nMr. von Mehren provided a response to the above request by letter of 20 October 2009.\n\n14.\n\nBy e-mail of 21 October 2009, the Respondent stated that it \"remain[ed] most uncomfortable with the relationship between Mr. von Mehren and the Debevoise firm\" and \"therefore intend[ed] shortly to file a formal proposal with the Secretary-General of ICSID for disqualification of Mr. von Mehren pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"\n\n15.\n\nBy e-mail of 22 October 2009, the Claimants commented on the Respondent's e-mail of 21 October 2009.\n\n16.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, the Respondent filed a formal proposal for disqualification of Mr. Robert B. von Mehren as an arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 27 October 2009, from the Centre, the President of the Tribunal invited Mr. von Mehren to furnish explanations, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), by 29 October 2009 and the parties to submit their observations by 2 November 2009. It also informed the Parties that the President, Judge Guillaume and his co-arbitrator, Professor Abi-Saab, will \"promptly consider\" the request pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4). The proceeding was suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (6).\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 28 October 2009, Mr. von Mehren furnished explanations with respect to the Respondent's proposal for the disqualification.\n\n19.\n\nOn 2 November 2009, the parties submitted their observations on the proposal for disqualification.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 3 November 2009, from the Centre, the President of the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment by 4 November 2009 on the Claimants' argument, made in their 2 November 2009 submission, that the Respondent's challenge was \"untimely.\" On 4 November 2009, the Respondent filed its comments.\n\n**II. The Proposal for Disqualification of Mr. Robert B. von Mehren**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 September 2009, counsel for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela sent a letter to the Tribunal stating:\n\nI regret to have to raise a matter concerning Mr. von Mehren which we believe should be addressed and clarified. The law firm of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP (\"Debevoise\") is acting as counsel for Holcim Ltd. in a case against the Republic, which was registered by ICSID on April 10, 2009 as case No ARB/09/3. That case, like this one, relates to governmental action concerning the cement industry in Venezuela taken in 2008.\n\nThe counsel noted that Mr. von Mehren was a retired partner of Debevoise, but added that he was still listed on Debevoise website under the section captioned \"Lawyers\" and that his contact information on the last page of his curriculum vitae lists the Debevoise office and a Debevoise telephone number and e-mail address. The Respondent requested \"supplemental information and clarification concerning the exact nature of Mr. von Mehren relationship with Debevoise.\"\n\n22.\n\nOn the same day, in response to that letter, Mr. von Mehren confirmed that, since 1995 he was a retired partner of Debevoise and provided detailed information on his present relation with that law firm. He specified that, \"[t]he Debevoise firm has had for many years a generous policy of providing an office - needless to say a small one - and some secretariat services to its retired partners.\" He said that, after his retirement, he structured his practice of arbitration so that neither the Debevoise firm, nor himself were conflicted out by activities of the other. He mentioned the fact that he receives a pension from Debevoise based on the firms' earnings during his period of partnership. He finally declared that he did not know that Debevoise was counsel in the *Holcim* case and had no knowledge of that case. He concluded by stating that he would decide the present case on the sole basis of the relevant facts and the applicable law.\n\n23.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, the Respondent asked for further information regarding the use by Mr. von Mehren of office and secretariat services provided by Debevoise with respect to the measures taken to keep his files and e-mails confidential. Mr. von Mehren answered on 20 October 2009 and gave further information on those measures.\n\n24.\n\nIn its letter of 26 October 2009, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr.von Mehren pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. The \"basis for this proposal is Mr. von Mehren's continuing relationship with the law firm of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP (\"Debevoise\"), which is counsel to the claimants in Holcim Limited, Holderfin B.V. and Caricement B.V. v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/3 (the \"Holcim Arbitration\"), a case arising out of the same nationalization process that lies at the heart of the present case. According to the Respondent, \"the necessity of ensuring the impartiality of arbitrators and of maintaining confidentiality makes it inappropriate for Mr. von Mehren to serve as arbitrator in this case.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn the same letter, the Respondent explained why the present case has \"a close relation to the Holcim Arbitration.\" It recalled that Debevoise was acting for Holcim in that arbitration. It stressed that \"Mr. von Mehren's continuing relationship with Debevoise would cause a reasonable person, having knowledge of the undisputed facts, to have doubts as to whether he would \u2018exercise independent judgment', as required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention.\" Moreover, that relationship \"creates a risk of disclosure of confidential information.\"\n\n26.\n\nUnder Article 58 of the ICSID Convention, \"[t]he decision on any proposal to disqualify a conciliator or arbitrator shall be taken by the other members of the Commission or Tribunal as the case may be.\" ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4) further provides that, when a party proposes the disqualification of an arbitrator, the other members of the Arbitral Tribunal \"shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned.\" Pending their decision, the proceeding is suspended in accordance with Rule 9(6).\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 October 2009, the President of the Tribunal, through the Centre, accordingly informed the parties that Professor Abi-Saab and himself would \"promptly consider\" the request and that the proceeding was suspended. In the same letter, the President informed Mr. von Mehren that he may \"furnish explanations to the two other Members of the Tribunal, pursuant to ICSID arbitration Rule 9(3), by October 29, 2009.\" He asked the parties to submit their observations by November 2, 2009.\n\n28.\n\nIn his letter of 28 October 2009, Mr. von Mehren responded in part as follows:\n\nI do not wish to comment on the merits of the Respondent's proposal, I affirm here that I have always considered it my duty to be impartial and to exercise independent judgment and that I intend to comply with this duty in this arbitration as I have in all others in which I have served.\n\nThe Tribunal forwarded Mr. von Mehren's explanation to the parties for any comment they wished to make.\n\n29.\n\nOn 2 November 2009, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it \"continues to believe that the continuing relationship between Mr. von Mehren and Debevoise gives rise to an appearance of a lack of impartiality and creates a risk of disclosure of confidential information.\" Accordingly, it maintained its position.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants also submitted their observations on 2 November 2009. They contended that the Respondent's challenge to Mr. von Mehren was untimely. They added that, \"[e]ven if timely, Respondent's challenge fails to identify facts suggesting Mr. von Mehren is unfit to serve as arbitrator.\" They concluded that the Respondent's proposal to disqualify Mr. von Mehren should be rejected. On 4 November 2009, the Respondent submitted that the Claimants' objection lacks any merit as far as they claim that the proposal for disqualification is untimely. The Claimants commented on that letter on the same day.\n\n**III. Discussion**\n-------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether the Respondent's proposal to disqualify Mr. von Mehren was untimely. If so, it will not have to consider the substance of that proposal.\n\n32.\n\nAn orderly and fair arbitration proceeding, while permitting challenges to arbitrators to be made on specific grounds, also requires that such challenges be made in a timely fashion. As a consequence, arbitration rules normally provide that challenges that are not timely should not be considered.\n\n33.\n\nIn this respect, it can be recalled that Article 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that: \"[a] party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send notice of his challenge within fifteen days after the appointment of the challenged arbitrator has been notified to the challenging party or within fifteen days after the circumstances mentioned in articles 9 and 10 became known to the party.\" The Guidelines of the International Bar Association on Conflicts of Interest, provided to the Tribunal by the Respondent, mention a time limit of 30 days in its Article 4(a) of Part I. Article 11 of the rules of arbitration of the International Court of arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce provides that \"[f]or a challenge to be admissible, it must be sent by a party either within 30 days from receipt by that party of the notification of the appointment or confirmation of the arbitrator, or within 30 days from the date when the party making the challenge was informed of the facts and circumstances on which the challenge is based if such date is subsequent to the receipt of such notification.\"\n\n34.\n\nBy contrast, neither the ICSID Convention, nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules specify a definite deadline beyond which a challenge is not to be considered. However under ICSID Arbitration Rule Rule 9(1) :\n\nA party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefore.\n\n35.\n\nThe word \"promptly\" is defined by the Oxford English dictionary as \"readily, quickly, directly at once, without a moment's delay.\" The Webster unabridged dictionary (2nd edition) defines it as \"readily, quickly, expeditiously.\"\n\nThe Spanish version of Rule 9(1) requires the challenging party to act \"sin demora,\" i.e. \"without delay\" and the French version requires it to file its proposal \"dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais.\"\n\n36.\n\nIt thus appears that Rule 9(1) does not fix a quantifiable deadline for submission of challenges. It is on a case by case basis that tribunals must decide whether or not a proposal for disqualification has been filed in a timely manner. However the text of Rule 9(1) implies that such a proposal must be made as soon as the party concerned learns of the grounds for a possible disqualification.1 The sanction for the failure to object promptly is waiver of the right to make objection, as provided for in ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.\n\n*See* Christopher H. Schreuer, \"The ICSID Convention: a Commentary,\" 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 1200, para. 11. *See also* Note B to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, last published in 1975 as part of ICSID/4/Rev.1 (\"ICSID Regulations and Rules\").\n\n37.\n\nIn *Azurix v. Argentina*, the ICSID Tribunal considered a delay of eight months as obviously too long under any \"reasonable standard.\"2 In *CDC v. Seychelles*, the *ad hoc* Committee arrived at the same conclusion for a delay of 147 days.3 It was also decided in *Vivendi v. Argentina* that a delay of fifty three days in submitting a challenge in \"a document of just 23 pages, does not constitute acting promptly given the nature of the case and the fact that the hearings on the merits were scheduled to take place within two weeks of the submission.\"4 By contrast, in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey*, the Tribunal noted that the Claimant filed its proposal for disqualification \"promptly,\" i.e. ten days after the constitution of the Tribunal.5\n\n*Azurix Corp v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Tribunal (25 February 2005), unpublished, but reported in para. 35 of the Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee seized of an application for annulment (1 September 2009) [Claimants' Legal Authorities, Tab 2].\n\n*CDC Group PLC v. Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment (29 June 2005), para. 53 [Claimants' Legal Authorities, Tab. 3].\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17), *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), *AWG Group v. Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL); Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (22 Oct. 2007, para. 26).\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (5 May 2008), para. 15 [Claimants' Legal Authorities, Tab 7].\n\n38.\n\nDid Venezuela act promptly (\"sin demora\") in making its proposal to disqualify Mr. von Mehren in the present case?\n\nIn this respect, one must recall that the basis of this proposal is \"Mr. von Mehren's continuing relationship\" with the law firm of Debevoise and the fact that Debevoise is counsel of the Claimant in another ICSID case, the *Holcim* case, which, according to Venezuela, is similar to the present case. Thus one has to determine the date at which the Respondent became aware of those circumstances and to assess whether it submitted its proposal for disqualification in a timely manner.\n\n39.\n\nMr. von Mehren was nominated in the Request for Arbitration filed on 16 October 2008. The Request was registered on 30 October 2008. The Request and the registration were in due time notified to Venezuela by ICSID. The nomination of Mr. von Mehren was confirmed by letters of 4 November 2008 and 31 December 2008, and finally by letters of 29 January 2009 and 5 February 2009, copy of which was sent to Venezuela. Most probably, the Respondent was already aware at that time that Mr.von Mehren was a retired partner of Debevoise. In any case it was so informed when, on 12 February 2009, it received the *curriculum vitae* submitted by Mr. von Mehren.\n\n40.\n\nDebevoise, on behalf of Holcim, initiated an ICSID proceeding against Venezuela at the latest on 23 March 2009 and this proceeding was registered on 10 April 2009.\n\n41.\n\nThus, according to the Claimants, \"every material element of Respondent's application for disqualification was well known to it\" at the latest on 10 April 2009.6 The delay must be computed from that date. The Respondent waited at least six months to present its proposal for disqualification. That was too long and it must be \"deemed to have waived its right to request a disqualification.\"7\n\nClaimants' Observations of 2 Nov. 2009, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Observations of 2 Nov. 2009, para. 17.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, alleges that:\n\n...there was no reason at the outset for the Republic to question Mr. von Mehren's qualifications as an arbitrator or his status as a retired partner of Debevoise. The filing of the *Holcim* case, with Debevoise as its counsel, came well after Mr. von Mehren was identified as Claimants' designated arbitrator, and no linkage was drawn between Mr. von Mehren and Debevoise prior to constitution of the Tribunal on July 6, 2009. Even when that connection was made, the facts disclosed on his curriculum vitae did not fully describe the full nature of the relationship with his former firm.8\n\nAccording to Venezuela, those facts were only elucidated in late September 2009 and the proposal for disqualification was then promptly presented.\n\nRespondent's Observations of 4 Nov. 2009, para. 7.\n\n43.\n\nWe must observe that, on 10 April 2009, the Respondent knew that Debevoise was acting for the Claimants in the *Holcim* case. It also knew at the latest on 12 February 2009 that Mr. von Mehren was a retired partner of Debevoise.\n\nMoreover, as noted by the Respondent itself in its request for information of 21 September 2009, the contact information on the last page of Mr. von Mehren's *curriculum vitae* circulated in February 2009 lists the Debevoise office at 919 Third Avenue, New York and a Debevoise telephone number and e-mail address. If the Respondent had any doubt on the risk that such a relationship could create for the independence of Mr. von Mehren, he could have asked for more information in April 2009, or at least at the beginning of July 2009 when the Tribunal in this case was constituted.\n\nIt waited till 21 September 2009 to do so. Mr. von Mehren answered that request in detail on the same day. The Respondent still waited till 15 October 2009 to ask for some further information relating to the measures taken to keep confidential Mr. von Mehren's files and emails. The answer was given on 20 October 2009 and the proposal for disqualification made on 26 October 2009.\n\n44.\n\nWe note that in April 2009, the Respondent had in hand all the elements allowing it to raise the questions it raised in September 2009. It waited more than five months to put those questions. It did it more than two months after the constitution of the Tribunal. Having immediately received on 21 September 2009 the required information, it still waited one month before presenting its proposal for disqualification. It did it in a document of less than five pages registered only three weeks before the session of the Tribunal which was scheduled to examine, *inter alia*, the Claimants' request for provisional measures.\n\nTaking all those factors into consideration, we conclude that Venezuela did not file its proposal to disqualify Mr. von Mehren \"promptly\" within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) and that therefore it has waived such objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.\n\n45.\n\nAs a consequence we do not have to consider the substance of the Respondent's objection.\n\n**IV. Dispositive**\n-------------------\n\n46.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons:\n\nThe Respondent's proposal for disqualification of Mr. Robert B. von Mehren of 26 October 2009 is dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2010-03-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

On 5 January 2010, Respondent filed observations to that letter. On 15 January 2010, Claimants sent to the Tribunal another letter.\n\n**II. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn their request for provisional measures dated 1 September 2009, the Claimants, CEMEX Caracas I and CEMEX Caracas II, first state that they are both incorporated in the Netherlands, which at all relevant times has been a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and a party to the Agreement on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Netherlands and Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991 (the \"BIT\"). They add that CEMEX Caracas I, owns 100% of CEMEX Caracas II, which, in turn, indirectly holds 75.7% of shares in CEMEX Venezuela through its wholly owned subsidiary Vencement Investments (\"Vencement\") a Cayman Island company.\"1\n\nRequest for Provisional Measures \u00a7 6.\n\n16.\n\nClaimants submit that they have been deprived of their rights of ownership over CEMEX Venezuela, Venezuela\u2019s largest and premier cement company. They contend that this expropriation occurred between May and August 2008 in breach of the BIT, as well as of customary international law. In their request for arbitration dated 16 October 2008, Claimants accordingly ask for a declaration noting those breaches and an order that \"Respondent restore to Claimants their shares in, and complete and exclusive control of, CEMEX Venezuela.\" In the alternative, they request \"an order that Respondent pay Claimants full compensation with respect to Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Treaty and international law....\"2\n\nRequest for Arbitration \u00a7 118.\n\n17.\n\nIn their Request for Provisional Measures, Claimants then submit that between 2004 and 2008 CEMEX Venezuela owned and used three cement-carriers registered in Venezuela, the *Corregidora,* the *Marianela* and the *Edalcin.* On 29 April 2008, \"CEMEX Venezuela executed an Irrevocable Trust Administration Agreement by which it conveyed title to the Vessels to Banco Interacciones S.A., a Mexican financial institution.\"3 Under the trust instrument, Sunbulk Shipping, N.V. (\"Sunbulk\") \"would immediately assume all of the Vessels\u2019 operational costs with an option to formally obtain legal title to the Vessels.\"4 On 9 August 2008, Sunbulk exercised its option to purchase such title. It \"paid Vencement US$49,974,012 and Vencement, in turn, cancelled a debt in the same amount which CEMEX Venezuela owed Vencement. On August 26, 2008, Sunbulk obtained provisional registration of the Vessels in Panama subject to the cancellation of the Venezuelan flags.\"5\n\nRequest for Provisional Measures \u00a7 17.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 17.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 19.\n\n18.\n\nIn the meantime, CEMEX Caracas\u2019s investment in CEMEX Venezuela had been expropriated. Thereafter, the Attorney-General of Venezuela, on 12 September 2008, \"demanded from the Venezuelan Maritime Court of First Instance in Caracas... a preventive embargo on the Vessels and a prohibition on alienation and encumbrance in favor of Venezuela.\"6 On 15 September 2008, the Caracas Court granted the Attorney-General\u2019s request for *ex parte* relief, imposing such measures. However, it required that Venezuela files a formal claim to perfect its ownership claims over the Vessels within ten days, failing which the preventive embargo and the prohibition on alienation and encumbrance would be suspended. According to Claimants, this was only done on 16 March 2009, without this new claim being further prosecuted.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 21.\n\n19.\n\nOn 20 March 2009, Venezuela petitioned the Panamanian Supreme Court to enforce the \"Caracas Court\u2019s order and/or issue its own order arresting the Vessels in favour of Venezuela.\"7 One day later, on 21 March, Venezuela petitioned the First Maritime Court of Panama to issue an order of seizure over the vessels and a prohibition of alienation and encumbrance in favour of Venezuela. On 24 March 2009, that Court issued such a prohibition and deferred to the Supreme Court the question whether an order of seizure was warranted. On 4 June 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the Panamanian Maritime Court to seize the vessels pending its decision on Venezuela\u2019s petition. As a consequence, the *\"Edalari\"* was arrested in the Panamanian port of *Cristobal en Col\u00f3n.* It was only released in June 2009, upon posting of a bond by Sunbulk.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 29.\n\n20.\n\nAfter having thus summarized the facts, Claimants submit that \"Venezuela should be enjoined from further action that will increase the Claimants\u2019 damages and thus aggravate this dispute.\"8\n\n*Ibidem* page 13.\n\n21.\n\nThey contend that \"the Tribunal Has Wide Power to Order Provisional measures at Any Stage, Including Prior to a Ruling on Jurisdiction.\"9 They add that \"the Tribunal\u2019s Powers Include the Power to Restrain Any Acts by Venezuela that Might Aggravate this Dispute or Make it Less Capable of Solution.\"10\n\n*Ibidem* page 13.\n\n*Ibidem* page 14.\n\n22.\n\nClaimants further submit that provisional relief is warranted in the instant case. According to them, the Tribunal possesses *prima facie* jurisdiction over the dispute. Moreover, Venezuela\u2019s efforts to seize the Vessels, unless enjoined, will severely aggravate the dispute and increase the Claimants\u2019 damages. More precisely, Claimants contend that \"The windfall CEMEX Venezuela seeks by the return of the Vessels would... increase the Claimants\u2019 right to demand compensation in these proceedings by the full amount of the debt that Vencement cancelled in its books when the Vessels were transferred to the benefit of CEMEX Venezuela.\"11\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 45.\n\n23.\n\nFor those reasons, Claimants request from the Tribunal:\n\n\"(i) An order requiring Venezuela to immediately cease any further efforts to seize the former assets of CEMEX Venezuela, including the Vessels;\"\n\n\"(ii) An order that Venezuela cease any litigation, whether in Panama, Venezuela, or elsewhere, having as its object the seizure of the Vessels or any money equivalent thereof, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) the proceedings before the Caracas Court;\n\n(2) the proceedings before the Panama Supreme Court; and\n\n(3) and the proceedings before the Panama Maritime Court;\n\n\"(iii) An order that Venezuela cease all efforts to enlist the assistance of other governments in seizing the Vessels or any bond or security thereof; and\n\n(iv)An order enjoining Venezuela from taking any action further prejudicing, aggravating the dispute before this Tribunal, or rendering this dispute more difficult of solution.\"12\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 50.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Memorial in Opposition to the Claimants\u2019 Request**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn its memorial dated 26 October 2009, Respondent opposes Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures. It first provides the Tribunal with a brief history of relevant facts intended to complete the Claimants\u2019 statements with respect to the CEMEX ownership of CEMEX Venezuela (\"CemVen\"), the purported sale of the Vessels, CEMEX\u2019s purchase of CemVen\u2019s foreign subsidiaries, the Nationalization Law, continued negotiations between CEMEX and Venezuela, how CEMEX attempted to cancel the Venezuelan flags and provisionally reflagged the vessels in Panama, as well as CemVen and Venezuela\u2019s actions in Panama.\n\n25.\n\nRespondent adds in particular that \"according to Claimants, Sunbulk mortgaged the Vessels in favour of Vencement on December 16, 2008.\"13 It adds that \"on September 9, 2009, Vencement filed a complaint in the Second Maritime Tribunal of Panama for execution on the naval mortgage over the Vessels for a purported debt of US $ 38,364,398.14\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Memorial of 26 October 2009, \u00a7 44.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 56.\n\n26.\n\nRespondent submits that under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, provisional measures \"must be based upon circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid an irreparable harm.\"15 They \"must relate to the preservation of the requesting party\u2019s rights and to the subject matter of the case before the tribunal....\"16 According to the Respondent, Claimants \"largely ignore these legal criteria and rely solely on the general principle of non-aggravation as the justification for its requested measures. At the same time, they admit that the only harm to Claimants (as opposed to Sunbulk) is purely financial in nature.\"17 Moreover \"the principle of non-aggravation\"... does not supplant the requirements of necessity, urgency and irreparable or non-compensable harm.\"18\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 58.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 59.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 61.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 62.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that \"provisional measures may only be granted to preserve the rights of a party.\"19 It adds that \"the rights for which Claimants seek protection here are, first and foremost, the supposed ownership rights to the Vessels held by Sunbulk, a CEMEX subsidiary which is not party to this proceeding.\"20 According to the Respondent, Claimants attempt to remedy this gap \"by converting Sunbulk\u2019s loss of the Vessels - if the Republic\u2019s legal efforts are successful - into an indirect \"increase in damages\" that will be suffered by Claimants if Vencement \"likely\" returns the purchase price of US $ 49,974,012 to Sunbulk and is left with, \"at most\", a reinstated debt from CemVen that will be left unpaid.\"21 Respondent points out that the request for arbitration makes no mention of the dispute between Venezuela over the ownership of the vessels, and, accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Sunbulk and the Vessels. \"[T]he \u2018right\u2019 that the Claimants seek to protect... is entirely collateral to the dispute... and cannot provide the basis for the grant of provisional measures.\"22\n\n*' Ibidem* \u00a7 68.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 71.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 72.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7\u00a7 72-73.\n\n28.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to meet their burden of showing that the inter-company transactions occurred as they allege, in particular with respect to the alleged loan of Vencement to Sunbulk. Even assuming the existence of such a loan, \"there is no reason to believe that Vencement would have any difficulty in obtaining repayment of the loan from Sunbulk if Vencement\u2019s lien were to be set aside.\"23 The alleged harm to Claimants either does not exist or is hypothetical and speculative.24\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 80.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 81.\n\n29.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondent, the alleged harm to Claimants is purely financial and can be compensated by monetary damages.\n\n30.\n\nFor those reasons, \"(i) Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures should be denied and (ii) Respondent should be awarded the costs of and associated with its opposition thereto, including its legal and administrative fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.\"25\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 86.\n\n**C. Hearing and Post-Hearing Correspondence**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAt the hearing of 16 November 2009, the Claimants present a chronology of events. They recall that \"Venezuela intends to challenge the Centre\u2019s overall jurisdiction over this dispute,\"26 but stress that this could not strip the Tribunal of its power to grant provisional measures. They contend that those measures would cause no prejudice to Venezuela. They submit that the \"multiple harms threatened here are distinct, severe, and indeed irreparable, and will make this dispute much more difficult of solution.\"27 They contest the submission of Venezuela according to which there is an absolute bar to provisional relief whenever the threatened harm can be quantified in monetary terms. They note that this may be the case in the Anglo-Saxon system, but they contend that this is not so in international law under the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and ICSID arbitral tribunals. They add that the requested relief does not prejudice the substance of the dispute.\n\nTranscript p.96.\n\nTranscriptp. 103.\n\n32.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent stresses that the nationalizations were decided by Venezuela in the exercise of its sovereignty in order to defend its vital national interests and that private corporations had the possibility of challenging the measures taken in Venezuelan Courts. It adds that minority shareholders of CEMEX Venezuela challenged the trust agreement in those Courts. Respondent confirms that it does not challenge *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It reiterates and develops the arguments already presented in writing in opposition to the request for provisional measures. It stresses in particular that provisional measures cannot be ordered to preserve the rights of a third party not encompassed within the scope of the request for arbitration. Respondent analysed in more detail ICSID\u2019s jurisprudence relating to urgency and necessity, especially in case of irreparable damage.\n\n33.\n\nIn their *post-hearing* letter of 22 December 2009, Claimants drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to a decision rendered on 30 November 2009 by the Venezuelan Second Administrative Court. They submit that this decision \"dispels any doubt that Respondent is severely aggravating the dispute before this Tribunal by using once again national courts, including its own courts, to adjudicate not only the seizure of the Vessels but also the overall legality of the seizure of Cemex Venezuela,\" contrary to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. They request that the Tribunal include these proceedings in the National Courts proceedings to be enjoined by their application.\n\n34.\n\nIn its letter of 5 January 2010, Respondent contends that the decision of 30 November 2009 did not comment on the question of the Vessels\u2019 ownership. It submits that, even if that decision \"were to adjudicate the ownership of the Vessels (which [it] does not do), [it] would have no different effect than a decision of the Caracas Maritime Court as far as the Claimants are concerned.\" \"[R]ecovery of the Vessels by the Republic and CemVen would either be a financial wash as far as Claimants are concerned or readily compensable by money damages.\" Moreover, it is submitted that the request for provisional measures relating to CemVen\u2019s nationalization, based on Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, must be denied, in the absence of any new facts of consequence and of any \"effort to set forth... the legal standards applicable under\" that Article.\n\n35.\n\nIn their letter of 15 January 2010, Claimants bring to the attention of the Tribunal recent developments of the proceedings in the Panamanian Courts.\n\n**III. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe present case was brought under the ICSID Convention and the Agreement on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Netherlands and Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. The Parties have not questioned the Tribunal\u2019s authority to recommend provisional measures even though its jurisdiction is being challenged. The Tribunal will therefore decide upon the request for provisional measures without dealing at this stage with the objection to jurisdiction of the Respondent.\n\n**A- Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Applicable Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe authority of the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures is governed by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n**Article 47**\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n38.\n\nThis provision has been elaborated on in Arbitration Rule 39:\n\n**Rule 39**\n\n**Provisional Measures**\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to the preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendation, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.\n\n39.\n\nAs recalled by the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal in *Pey Casado v. Chile,* Article 47 of the Convention \"is not an innovation in the history of international jurisdiction; it is directly inspired by Article 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, hence the particular importance that can be accorded to the judgments given in the past by that Court\"28 in that matter.\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Provisional Measures of 25 September 2001, \u00a7 2. *See also* Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed. 2009), p. 759.\n\n40.\n\nIn a number of cases, the International Court of Justice decided that its power \"to indicate provisional measures under Article 41 of the Statute has as its object to preserve the respective rights of each party to the proceedings \"pending the final decision,\" providing that such measures are justified to prevent irreparable prejudice to the rights which are the subject of the dispute.\" Thus, that power \"can be exercised only if there is an urgent necessity to prevent irreparable prejudice to such rights, before the Court has given its final decision.\"29\n\n*Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v. Uruguay), Order of 23 January 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 31-32. *See also* *Passage through the Great Belt* (Finland v. Denmark), Order of 29 July 1991, ICJ Reports 1991 p. 17, \u00a723; *Certain Criminal Proceedings in France* (Republic of the Congo v. France), Order of 17 June 2003, ICJ Reports 2003 p. 107, \u00a722.\n\n41.\n\nICSID Tribunals have taken the same approach in the interpretation and application of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. In a number of cases, they stated that \"provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly.\"30 They unanimously judged that those measures could only be granted to protect the rights of either party in case of urgency and necessity.31\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Order of 28 October 1999; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Order of 6 September 2005, \u00a738; *Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Order of 6 April 2007 \u00a733; *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Order of 17 August 2007; *See also* *Sergei Paushok v. Mongolia,* 2 September 2008, \u00a7 39 for a case of arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nAmong the decisions already quoted in the proceeding paragraph, *see* *Plama v. Bulgaria,* \u00a739; *Phoenix v. Czech Republic,* \u00a733; *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador,* \u00a7 59. *See also* *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Order of 29 June 2009, \u00a751; *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21), \u00a754; *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Ecuador and Petroecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Order of 8 May 2009, \u00a743.\n\n42.\n\nThe requirement of necessity implies an assessment of the risk of damage which provisional measures are intended to avert. In the present case, the parties diverge on the kind of risk justifying such measures.\n\n43.\n\nAs recalled above, irreparable prejudice is always required by the International Court of Justice for provisional measures (see \u00a740 above).\n\n44.\n\nTraditionally, ICSID Arbitral Tribunals also base their decision on the criteria of irreparable harm or damage. As noted by Professor Schreuer, \"ICSID Arbitration Practice shows that Tribunals will only grant provisional measures if they are found to be necessary, urgent and required in order to avoid irreparable harm.\"32 Thus, in *Plama v. Bulgaria,* the Tribunal stated that provisional measures must be necessary to \"avoid the occurence of irreparable harm or damage.\"33 In *Phoenix v. Czech Republic,* the Tribunal referred to \"the action of a party capable of causing or of threatening to cause irreparable prejudice to the rights involved.\"34 In *Occidental v. Ecuador,* the Tribunal decided that \"the circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party\u2019s right and when the need is urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm.\"35\n\nSchreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed. 2009), p.776.\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* \u00a738.\n\n*Phoenix v. Czech Republic,* \u00a733.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador,* \u00a759.\n\n45.\n\nRecently, however, two ICSID Tribunals made use of different formulas. In the *Burlington v. Ecuador* case, the Tribunal found appropriate \"in the circumstances of the case, to adopt the standard of harm not adequately reparable by the award of damages, to use the words of the UNCITRAL Model Law.\"36 In the *Perenco v. Ecuador* case, the Tribunal recognized that \"many of the authorities express the test in terms of \"irreparable loss,\" but added that article 47 does not lay down such a test and did not retain it.37\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador,* \u00a782.\n\n*Perenco v. Ecuador and Petroecuador,* \u00a7 43.\n\n46.\n\nIn the opinion of this Tribunal, the standards retained in those two last cases do not differ in substance from the standard of \"irreparable damage\" generally used.\n\n47.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal first observes that the International Court of Justice often granted provisional measures to avoid irreparable harm, although damages could be awarded in order to compensate the alleged prejudice.38 This has been done in particular when the health or life of people and sometimes their properties were in jeopardy. Thus, in the *Nuclear Tests* cases opposing Australia and New Zealand to France, it was contended that the population of the Claimant States would suffer from the radioactive fall out of the French atmospheric tests. The Court considered that, if established, the effects of the tests could not be reversed by any monetary compensation and ordered provisional measures.39 Similarly, in the case of the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran,* the Court stated that \"continuation of the situation the subject of the present request exposes the human beings concerned to privation, hardship, anguish and even danger to life and health and thus a serious possibility of irreparable harm.\"40 Provisional measures were indicated on that ground. For comparable reasons, provisional measures were granted in cases of armed conflicts creating risks of irreparable prejudice to persons or properties,41 as well as in cases of imminent execution of individuals condemned to death.42\n\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice adopted the same approach in the *Sino-Belgian Treaty* case, Order of 8 January 1927 (PCIJ, Reports, series A, n\u00b0 8).\n\n*Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France),* Order of 22 June 1973, ICJ Reports 1973 p. 105, \u00a730.\n\nUnited States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran, Order of 15 December 1979, ICJ Reports 1979, p. 20, \u00a742.\n\n*Frontier dispute (Burkina-Faso v. Republic of Mali),* Order of 10 January 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, p.10 \u00a721; Application of the convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Order of 8 April 1993, ICJ Reports 1993, p.22 \u00a745; *Land and Maritime Boundary (Cameroon v. Nigeria),* Order of 15 March 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, p. 22, \u00a738.\n\n*Grand (Germany v. United States of America),* Order of 3 March 1999, ICJ Reports 1999, p.15, \u00a724; *Avena and others (Mexico v. United States of America),* Order of 5 February 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, p.91, \u00a755.\n\n48.\n\nBy contrast, in the *Aegean Sea* case, the Court considered that the breach by Turkey of the alleged rights of Greece through seismic exploration of the disputed continental shelf was \"capable of reparation by appropriate means.\" For that reason, the Court dismissed the Greek request for provisional measures.43\n\n*Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* (Greece v. Turkey), Order of 11 September 1976, ICJ Reports p. 11, \u00a733.\n\n49.\n\nThus the International Court of Justice, when applying the test of \"irreparable prejudice,\" makes in fact a distinction between:\n\n(a) Actions which should be restrained, because their effects, though capable of financial compensation, are such that compensation cannot fully remedy the damage suffered;\n\n(b) and actions which may well prove to have infringed a right and caused harm, but in respect to which it will be sufficient to award damages, without taking provisional measures.\n\n50.\n\nThe same distinction can be drawn from an analysis of ICSID case law, both in cases where tribunals used the criteria of irreparable damage and in cases where they had recourse to other criteria.\n\n51.\n\nLooking into the first category of cases, the Tribunal notes that in *Occidental,* Claimants were asserting that they had a right to be restored in their oil concession and, on that basis, requested provisional measures to protect that right. The Tribunal decided that Claimants had not establish \"a strongly arguable case that there exists\" such a right and dismissed the corresponding request for provisional measures on that ground. It added that any prejudice suffered as a result of the termination of the contract, \"if subsequently found illegal by the tribunal, can be readily compensated by a monetary award.\" On that distinct ground, it also dismissed the requested measures.44\n\n*Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador* \u00a7\u00a7 86, 92.\n\n52.\n\nIn *Plama v. Bulgaria,* the decision observes that \"[w]hat Claimant is seeking in this arbitration are monetary damages for breaches of Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty. Whatever the outcome of the.... proceedings... in Bulgaria is, Claimant\u2019s right to pursue its claims for damages in the arbitration and the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s ability to decide these claims will not be affected. The Tribunal accepts Respondent\u2019s argument that harm is not irreparable if it can be compensated for by damages, which is the case in the present arbitration and which, moreover, is the only remedy Claimant seeks.\"45\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* \u00a7 46.\n\n53.\n\nIn *Burlington v. Ecuador,* the Tribunal stressed that \"[u]nlike Occidental, this case is not one of only \u2018more damages\u2019.... The risk here is the destruction of an ongoing investment and its revenue-producing potential which benefits both the investor and the State.\"46 As a consequence, the Tribunal ordered the establishment of an escrow account, where the funds which were the subject of the dispute could be held, pending the final award.\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador,* \u00a7 83.\n\n54.\n\nIn *Perenco v. Ecuador,* the Tribunal recognized that provisional measures \"will not be necessary when a party can be adequately compensated by an award of damages if it successfully vindicates its rights when the case is finally decided.\" But it apprehended that the Claimant would suffer \"extensive seizure of its oil production or other assets,\" and that its \"business would be crippled, if not destroyed.\"47 It therefore established an escrow account for the same purpose as in Burlington.\n\n*Perenco v. Ecuador,* \u00a7\u00a7 43, 53, 60.\n\n55.\n\nThus, ICSID Tribunals, when considering government actions which may well prove to have infringed a right and caused harm, make a distinction between:\n\n(a) situations where the alleged prejudice can be readily compensated by awarding damages;\n\n(b) and those where there is a serious risk of destruction of a going concern that constitutes the investment.\n\nIn the first category of cases, provisional measures were denied because of the absence of an \"irreparable harm.\" In the second category of cases they were granted, the tribunals using other standards \u2014 although they could have based their decision on the fact that, the destruction of the ongoing concern that constituted the investment, would have created an \"irreparable harm.\"\n\n56.\n\nIn the light of the preceding analysis, the Tribunal sees no reason not to retain the generally accepted standard of \"irreparable harm\" as criterion for the \"necessity\" required by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. It is on that basis that it will examine the request for provisional measures in the present case.\n\n**B- Claimant\u2019s Submissions Relating to the Seizure of Vessels and Other Assets of CEMEX Venezuela**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants submit that from May to August 2008 they have been deprived by the Respondent of their rights of ownership over CEMEX Venezuela. They recall that, before that expropriation, CEMEX Venezuela had in April 2008 sold three cement carriers it previously owned and that those carriers are presently the property of Sunbulk, a Mexican company, which registered them in Panama. They add that the Respondent has brought actions both in Panamanian and Venezuelan Courts to obtain the seizure of those vessels. They contend that, \"if Venezuela succeeds in its *ex post facto* efforts to unwind the transfer of the Vessels to Sunbulk and return title to CEMEX Venezuela, then all consideration previously furnished by Sunbulk for the Vessels will obviously need to be refunded which will leave the loss of these Vessels to be borne by Vencement and, therefore, by Cemex Caracas, Vencement\u2019s direct shareholder\";48 \"this will burden Claimants with an additional loss of almost $50 millions beyond what is currently being claimed in the arbitration.\"49 On those grounds, the Claimants request that the Tribunal issue orders requiring Venezuela, *inter alia,* to cease any further efforts to seize the vessels or any other former assets of CEMEX Venezuela, in particular through litigation in Panama, Venezuela or elsewhere (for more details see \u00a7\u00a7 15-23, above).\n\n(a) Seizure of Vessels and Irreparable Harm\n\nRequest for Provisional Measures \u00a745.\n\nLetter of 10 September 2009 forwarding the request for provisional measures.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that this request for provisional measures is based on the fact that Venezuela\u2019s efforts to seize the Vessels or other former assets will, if they succeed, \"increase the Claimants\u2019 damages\"50 to be awarded by the Tribunal. According to the Claimants themselves, the only consequence for them of those seizures would be a financial loss. Such a loss could be readily compensated by a damages award. Thus, the alleged harm is not \"irreparable\" and there is neither necessity, nor urgency to grant the requested provisional measures.\n\n(b) Seizure of Vessels and Aggravation of the Dispute\n\nRequest for Provisional Measures p. 18.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants, however, request the same measures on another ground. They submit that Venezuela\u2019s action \"that increases damages by an eight-figure sum is conduct that aggravates the dispute.\"51 They add that the dispute is also being aggravated by actions brought by Venezuela in its own Administrative Courts, in order to \"adjudicate the legality of the Respondent\u2019s efforts to seize... the Vessels....\"52 The Claimants conclude that those facts warrant the issuance of provisional measures to avoid the seizure of the vessels and of other assets.\n\nRequest for Provisional Measures \u00a747.\n\nLetter of 22 December 2009, p. 1.\n\n60.\n\nThe International Court of Justice and ICSID Tribunals have on several occasions issued provisional measures directing the parties not to take any actions which could aggravate or extend the dispute or render more difficult their settlement.53\n\nFor the International Court of Justice, see the long list provided in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Order of 23 January 2007, ICJ Reports, 2007, p. 16, \u00a749. For ICSID Tribunals, see the case law listed in *Burlington,* \u00a7\u00a7 63-64; *see also* *Perenco* \u00a7\u00a7 55-57.\n\n61.\n\nHowever, the measures requested by the Claimants to avoid the seizure of the Vessels or of other former assets of CEMEX Venezuela do not meet the requirements of urgency and necessity of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. They could not be granted for these reasons (see paragraph 57 above). The so-called principle of non-aggravation cannot supplant the requirements of Article 47. The measures relating to the Vessels cannot be granted on the basis of the principle of non-aggravation alone.\n\n**C- Other Claimants\u2019 Submissions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n(a) Aggravation of the Dispute in General\n-----------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn their request for provisional measures, the Claimants also ask the Tribunal, in more general terms, to enjoin Venezuela from taking any action further prejudicing, aggravating the dispute before this Tribunal, or rendering this dispute more difficult of solution.\n\n63.\n\nThis request raises the question whether, under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal has an independent power to recommend provisional measures relating to a dispute. In other words, when, in the opinion of a Tribunal, there is no urgency or necessity to adopt provisional measures directed at the preservation of the rights of the parties, is it still possible for it to recommend other provisional measures in order to avoid the aggravation or extension of the dispute?\n\n64.\n\nThis question has recently been examined by the International Court of Justice in the *Pulp Mills* case. The Court recalled that it \"has on several occasions issued provisional measures directing the parties not to take any actions which could aggravate or extend the dispute or render more difficult its settlement.\" It also observed that \"in those cases, provisional measures other than measures directing the parties not to take actions to aggravate or extend the dispute or to render more difficult its settlement were also indicated.\" Then the Court noted that: \"it has not found that at present there is an imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights of Uruguay in dispute.\" In the absence of provisional measures indicated on that basis, the Court decided it had no power to indicate provisional measures relating to the \"aggravation or extension of the dispute.\"54\n\n*Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay),* Order of 23 January 2007, ICJ Reports p. 16, \u00a7 49.\n\n65.\n\nThis Tribunal sees no reason to take a different position. It recalls that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention does give ICSID Arbitral Tribunals power to recommend measures directed at the preservation of the rights of the parties. In exercising this power, ICSID Tribunals may recommend measures in order to avoid the aggravation or extension of the dispute. But those \"non-aggravation\" measures are ancillary measures which cannot be recommended in the absence of measures of a purely protective or preservative kind.\n\n66.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it must dismiss the request of the Claimants relating, in very general terms and without any further specification, to the \"nonaggravation\" of the dispute.\n\n(b) Article 26 of the ICSID Convention\n--------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nFinally, in a letter sent on 22 December 2009, after the hearing, the Claimants drew the attention of the Tribunal to a decision issued by a Venezuelan Administrative Court on 30 November 2009 on the request of the Attorney General of Venezuela. They contend that those administrative proceedings are an obvious attempt \"to adjudicate not only the seizure of the Vessels[55] but also the overall legality of the seizure of Cemex Venezuela,\" \"an issue expressly reserved to this Tribunal by Article 26\" of the ICSID Convention.56 For that reason they \"request that the \u2018administrative\u2019 proceedings be included in the national courts proceedings sought to be enjoined by\" [their] application.\"57\n\nQuestion dealt with in paragraphs 59-61 above.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of 22 December 2009, pp. 1- 4.\n\n*Ibidem,* p. 5\n\n68.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[c]onsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\"\n\n69.\n\nThe exclusive jurisdiction of ICSID Arbitral Tribunals under Article 26 is certainly susceptible of protection by way of provisional measures58. However, it remains to be seen whether Claimants establish that the continuation of the proceedings in the Venezuelan Administrative Court meets the requirements necessary for recommending such measures.\n\n*Mine v. Guinea,* 6 January 1998, 4 ICSID Reports 77; *CSOB v. Slovakia,* Procedural Order no 4 of 11 January 1999 quoted in the Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999; Procedural Order no 5, 1st March 2000, *Burlington v, Ecuador* \u00a7 57.\n\n70.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants are only stating very briefly in their letter of 22 December 2009 that this is so, without developing in any way their argument through an analysis of the relevant facts and of the applicable international and Venezuelan Law. Hence, for the purpose of the present review, the Tribunal cannot but hold that the Claimants have not establish a *prima facie* case of breach of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention justifying provisional measures.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that, in any event, the decisions which may be taken by the Venezuelan Administrative Courts, as well as by any other domestic Court, can neither bind this Tribunal, nor prevail over the decision which it may take if it finds that it has jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n72.\n\nFastly, the Tribunal makes no order here regarding the costs of and arising from the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures.\n\n73.\n\nFor those reasons:\n\n(a) The Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures is rejected.\n\n(b) The decision on the costs of the procedure relating to the request for provisional measures is reserved to a later stage of this arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2010-12-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 16 October, 2008, Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B.V., companies incorporated in the Netherlands, filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") a Request for Arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. On 30 October, 2008, the Centre registered the Request.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in this proceeding by the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in New York City. Since 29 January, 2009, the Respondent has been represented in this proceeding by the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP in New York City and Mexico City.\n\n3.\n\nNo agreement having been reached between the parties on the method of constituting the Tribunal, and more than sixty days having elapsed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration, by letter of 31 December, 2008, the Claimants invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n4.\n\nBy the same letter the Claimants reiterated their appointment, as arbitrator, of Mr. Robert B. von Mehren, a U.S. national, whose appointment had initially been included in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 20 February, 2009, the Respondent appointed Professor Georges Abi-Saab, a national of Egypt as arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal not having been constituted within 90 days of the registration of the Request for Arbitration, by letter of 21 May, 2009, the Claimants requested the appointment of the third presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, as provided for under Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). On 19 June, 2009, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Gilbert Guillaume, a national of France, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nAll of the arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Tribunal was constituted on 6 July, 2009. Ms. Katia Yannaca-Small, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 July, 2009, having consulted with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal fixed the first session to be held on 16 November, 2009, at the World Bank's Paris Conference Center. On the same day, the parties were invited to confer and to advise the Tribunal, by no later than 16 October, 2009, of any points on the session's provisional agenda about which they were able to reach agreement. The parties were also invited to notify the Tribunal of any other items that they wished to see included in the agenda.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 September, 2009, the Claimants filed a request for provisional measures. After an exchange of communications between the parties, the Tribunal, by letter of 30 September, 2009, from the Centre, informed the parties that their respective positions on the request for provisional measures would be heard during the first session. On 26 October, 2009, the Respondent filed a reply to the Claimants' request for provisional measures.\n\n10.\n\nOn 26 October, 2009, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. von Mehren. On 2 November, 2009, the Claimants filed observations on the Respondent's proposal for disqualification.\n\n11.\n\nOn 6 November, 2009, President Guillaume and Professor Abi-Saab, acting under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention, dismissed the proposal for the disqualification of Mr. von Mehren made by the Respondent.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal and the hearing on provisional measures was held on 16 November, 2009 at the World Bank's Paris Conference Center.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 January, 2010, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \"Respondent\" or \"Venezuela\") submitted a Memorial containing its objections to jurisdiction (the \"Memorial\").\n\n18.\n\nThe Memorial first explains that the Request for Arbitration was presented by two companies, Cemex Caracas and Cemex Caracas II, which complain of the nationalization of a Venezuelan company, Cemex Venezuela (\"CemVen\") in which they held an indirect ownership interest.\n\n19.\n\nVenezuela proceeds to provide the Tribunal with some information on the structure of the companies involved in the case. It submits that a Mexican company, Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Cemex\") owns 100% of Cemex Espa\u00f1a S.A., which owns 100% of one of the Claimants, a Dutch company called Cemex Caracas. In turn, Cemex Caracas owns 100% of the other Claimant, another Dutch Company called Cemex Caracas II. Cemex Caracas II owns 100% of Vencement Investments (\"Vencement\") a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Finally, as of 2002, Vencement owns 75.7% of Cemex Venezuela (CemVen), the cement company that was operating in the territory of the Respondent.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent then notes that the Claimants invoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela concluded on 22 October, 1991 (the \"BIT\", the \"Dutch Treaty\" or the \"Treaty\"). In addition, Claimant Cemex Caracas has \"reserved its right\" to rely on Venezuela's Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"Investment Law\") as an additional basis for jurisdiction.1 The Respondent contests those two alleged bases of jurisdiction.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 3.\n\n**1. Jurisdiction Under the Dutch Treaty**\n------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that Articles 9(1) and 9(4) of the BIT cover \"disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter.\" It adds that \"while Article 1(a) of the Dutch Treaty defines 'investments' to include 'every kind of asset,' it then goes on to enumerate five categories of assets within its scope, and makes no reference whatsoever to the subject of ownership or control, whether 'direct or indirect,' or to the location of the investments or the manner in which investments may be made.\"2 According to the Respondent, the omission of this additional language from the definition of investment is significant, when comparing the text of the Dutch Treaty with other BITs concluded by Venezuela or the Netherlands or with multilateral treaties for the protection of investments. Accordingly, the Dutch Treaty does not cover indirect investors.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 27\n\n22.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this interpretation is reinforced by the facts that the BIT uses a broad definition of \"national\" (or \"investor\") and that it only concerns investments located in the territory of the Contracting Parties. Moreover, such an interpretation has been found in a comparable case in an arbitral award rendered under the auspices of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in *Berschader and Bershader v. Russian Federation*, Case No. 080/2004, and is compatible with ICSID case law.\n\n23.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants qualify as Dutch Nationals under the BIT because of their incorporation in the Netherlands. However, they do not themselves have investments in the territory of Venezuela. Their indirect investments through Vencement do not entitle them to assert claims for alleged violation of the BIT. They are not the \"proper parties to this proceeding.\"3\n\nMemorial \u00b6 43.\n\n**2. Jurisdiction Under the Investment Law**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent then submits that under ICSID case law, the consent to ICSID jurisdiction required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention can be contained in a contract or in a document, such as a request for arbitration, accepting an offer previously made. In all cases, however, consent must exist. In the present case, neither the Claimants nor Venezuela have given such consent.\n\n25.\n\nFirst of all, neither the letter of the Claimants of 9 April, 2008, \"accepting the Republic's offer of consent to ICSID arbitration contained in Article 9(1) of the Dutch Treaty,\"4 nor the Request for Arbitration \"made any reference to, or purported to accept, any consent of the Republic for ICSID arbitration supposedly contained in Article 22 of the Investment Law.\"5 It is only in a footnote in the request for provisional measures that one of the Claimants, Cemex Caracas, reserved its rights to rely on that law. It did so after having initiated the arbitration without invoking expressly the Investment Law. This cannot be considered as a written consent given in due time.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 46.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 47.\n\n26.\n\nVenezuela then contends that Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide the requisite express and unequivocal consent to ICSID arbitration required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In this respect, it refers to the text of Article 22 itself and compares it to the provisions of ICSID's model clauses and with those of bilateral investment treaties concluded by Venezuela. It also refers to publications and commentaries on the Investment Law made before 2005, to Venezuelan legal principles and to a decision rendered on 17 October, 2008 by the Supreme Court of Venezuela. It adds that a comparison of Article 22 with other national investment laws and ICSID case law leads to the same conclusion.\n\n27.\n\nFinally, on an alternative basis, the Respondent submits that \"[n]either Claimant was the 'owner' of CemVen, which is alleged to constitute the 'investment' in this case.\"6 The Claimants were not directly controlling the investment made in CemVen by Vencement. As a consequence, according to Venezuela, they do not qualify as \"international investors\" under the Investment Law and its applicable regulation.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 103.\n\n28.\n\nVenezuela, therefore, concludes that \"the claims set forth in the Request should be dismissed in their entirety inasmuch as: (i) the indirect investments of Claimants in any event do not qualify for protection under the Dutch Treaty; (ii) Claimants have not consented to ICSID arbitration under the Investment Law; (iii) Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide a basis for finding 'consent' on the part of the Republic to arbitration of this dispute; and (iv) Claimants do not qualify as 'international investors' as defined in the Investment Law and the Investment Law Regulation.\"7\n\nMemorial \u00b6 110.\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants first submit that their claim arises out of Respondent's seizure of Cemex Venezuela carried out by decrees of 27 May, 2008, 15 August, 2008 and 19 August, 2008 and by the occupation of Cemex plants by Venezuelan armed forces at the same time. They add that \"***no compensation whatsoever has been paid for this forcible taking***.\"8 They reassert the claims set forth in their Request for Arbitration for purposes of remedying Venezuela's violation of its obligations.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 21 (emphasis in the original).\n\n**1. Jurisdiction Under the BIT**\n---------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants then contend that the Centre possesses jurisdiction to hear each of the claims under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.9\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 12.\n\n31.\n\nThey stress in this respect that the Respondent has given its clear and unambiguous consent to ICSID jurisdiction in Article 9 of the BIT. They submit that the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(a) of that treaty is broad and non-exhaustive and extends to indirect investments. They add that \"Respondent's Narrow Interpretation of 'Investment' Finds No Support in Either the Vienna Convention or the ICSID Convention.\"10 They contend that \"Past Arbitral Decisions Confirm that Claimants have an 'Investment' As defined Under the BIT.\"11 They add that Cemex Venezuela is an investment \"\u2018In the Territory' of Venezuela.\"12 They submit that \"Other Provisions of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT, Including the Definition of 'Investor' Reinforce the Conclusion that the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT Covers Indirect Investments.\"13 They add that \"Respondent's Concerns About 'Layering' of Claims Are Not Well Founded.\"14\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 21.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 38.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 39.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 46.\n\n32.\n\nPassing to supplementary means of interpretation, the Claimants stress that \"Respondent's Adoption of the Netherlands Model BIT Indicates an Intention to Follow the ProInvestment Policies Expressed Therein.\"15 Moreover, \"Venezuela's Treaty Practice Has Consistently Favored a Broad Interpretation of 'Investment'.\"16\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 47.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 50.\n\n**2. Jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"Separately and Independently From the BIT, Article 22 of Venezuela's Investment Law Confers Jurisdiction On the Centre.\"17\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 56.\n\n34.\n\nIn this respect, they first submit that \"the Question of Whether Article 22 of the Investment Law is a 'Consent' is a Question of International Law.\"18 Then they contend that the investment made by the Claimants in Cemex Venezuela is an \"international investment\" and that the Claimants are \"international investors\" for purposes of the Investment Law. They add that Respondent's narrow interpretation of ownership or effective control is not well founded.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 57.\n\n35.\n\nThey further submit that Article 22 of the Investment Law expresses Respondent's consent to the Centre's jurisdiction for purposes of the ICSID Convention. In this respect they refer to the terms of Article 22, as well as the intention of its drafters. They add that the principle of good faith requires that that article be construed as a binding offer. They contend that Respondent's comparisons with other investment laws are unavailing and they invoke ICSID case law in support of their position. They stress that the consent to arbitration in Article 22 is not inconsistent with Venezuelan Law and that the weight of scholarship confirms their interpretation. Finally, they submit that the Respondent's reliance on the Venezuelan Supreme Court decision is unavailing.\n\n36.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimants, they have consented to arbitrate for purposes of Article 22.\n\n37.\n\nThey finally submit that \"Even if Jurisdiction Under Article 22 Is Lacking, Respondent's Various Breaches of the Investment Law Are Also Violations of the BIT.\"19\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 101.\n\n38.\n\nAccordingly, they request \"that the Tribunal render a decision on jurisdiction:\n\n(a) dismissing the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction in their entirety;\n\n(b) finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of the claims presented in the Claimants' Request for Arbitration;\n\n(c) ordering the continuation of this proceeding pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4); and\n\n(d) awarding the Claimants their legal fees and costs incurred in connection with opposing the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, including legal fees, experts' fees and the Claimant's share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre.\"20\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 190.\n\n**C. The Reply Memorial of the Respondent on Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent first stresses that \"Claimants fail to explain the absence of Vencement as a party to this proceeding.\"21\n\nReply \u00b6 3.\n\n40.\n\nIt submits that Claimants \"Lack Standing to Assert Claims Under the Dutch Treaty in Relation to the CemVen shares.\"22 It stresses that the text of the Dutch treaty does not support Claimants' interpretation. The reasoning of other arbitral decisions does not warrant a departure from that text. Venezuela concluded that \"Claimants are unable to demonstrate that Vencement's shareholding in CemVen is their own investment and that they have *ius standi* to assert claims under the Dutch Treaty.\"23\n\nReply at p. 6.\n\nReply \u00b6 49.\n\n41.\n\nVenezuela further submits that its Investment Law provides no basis for ICSID jurisdiction over this dispute. According to Venezuela, \"Article 22 of the Investment Law Does Not Constitute Consent by the Republic to ICSID Arbitration.\"24 In this respect it refers to the terms of that article, as well as its history, its purpose, the commentaries on that text and Venezuelan legal principles.\n\nReply at p. 26.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants have not given their consent to jurisdiction under the Investment Law. \"The form of Claimants' consent in their April 9, 2008 letters, as well as the Request for Arbitration itself, demonstrate that these references fall far short of constituting a written 'instrument of consent,' as contemplated by the Centre's Rules and Article 25 of the Convention.\"25\n\nReply \u00b6 88.\n\n43.\n\nIt finally submits that \"[j]urisdiction is also lacking under the Investment Law because Claimants do not qualify as 'international investors' under the statute and therefore are not within the scope of Article 22.\"26\n\nReply \u00b6 89.\n\n44.\n\nOn those bases, Venezuela concludes that \"the claims brought by Claimants should be dismissed in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction inasmuch as: (i) Claimants lack standing under the Dutch Treaty to assert claims for alleged violations of its provisions in relation to the shares of CemVen; (ii) Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide a basis for finding 'consent' on the part of the Republic to arbitration of this dispute; (iii) Claimants have not consented to ICSID arbitration under the Investment Law; and (iv) Claimants do not qualify as 'international investors' as defined in the Investment Law and the Investment Law Regulation.\"27\n\nReply \u00b6 100.\n\n**D. The Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants observe that a number of points relating to jurisdiction are uncontested by the Respondent. \"[T]he *sole* question facing the Tribunal under the Netherlands BIT is whether Claimants' indirect equity stake in Cemex Venezuela S.A.C.A. is an 'investment' for purposes of Article 1(a). The answer to that question is a resounding 'yes'.\"28 \"Furthermore, once jurisdiction is established under the Netherlands BIT, *all* claims in the Request for Arbitration may be heard by this Tribunal, as a violation of investment protections offered by Venezuelan Law also constitutes a BIT violation.\"29\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 14.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 15.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants then submit that Respondent's sole objection to jurisdiction under the BIT is untenable. According to Claimants, Venezuela \"Cannot Overcome Decades of Unanimous Case Law.\"30 Moreover, they contend that \"Respondent's Attempts to Erect Barriers to Claimants' Standing Find No Support in the Treaty Text,\"31 and, in particular, are not supported by Articles 1(a), 1(b) and 9(1). Furthermore, \"All the Supplementary Means of Interpretation Demonstrate that Indirect Investments Are Intended to be Covered by the BIT.\"32 \"Respondent's Attempt to Impose a Policy-Based Limitation on Indirect Investors' Standing Is Impermissible and, In Any Event, Unfounded.\"33 The Claimants have made an investment in the \"territory\" of Venezuela.\n\nRejoinder at p. 7.\n\nRejoinder at p. 17.\n\nRejoinder at p. 29.\n\nRejoinder at p. 27.\n\n47.\n\nClaimants further submit that, in the present case, ICSID jurisdiction independently exists under Article 22 of the Investment Law. According to the Claimants, that article constitutes an expression of Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration, whether considering the text itself, the *SPP v. Egypt* case or any supplemental means of interpretation.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants then refer to a decision rendered recently in *Mobil Corp. v. Venezuela*.34 They note that the ICSID tribunal in that case \"concluded that Article 22 does not constitute Venezuela's consent to arbitral jurisdiction.\"35 They observe that, in that decision, the tribunal distanced itself from the doctrine of *effet utile* on the basis of the judgment rendered by the International Court of Justice (the \"ICJ\") in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case. However, they stress that under ICJ case law, including that judgment, \"critically, the interpretative principle 'must seek the interpretation which is in harmony with a *natural and reasonable* way of reading the text'.\"36 Such a reading should favor the interpretation that gives effect to the mandatory language of Article 22. Moreover, such an interpretation would conform to the legislative history of that article, commentaries made on that text and with Venezuela's intention discerned from the preamble and the stated purposes and structure of the law.\n\n*Mobil Corp. and Others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27 (June 10, 2010).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 92.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 96.\n\n49.\n\nFinally the Claimants reaffirm that they must be considered as \"international investors\" under the Investment Law. They also reaffirm that they have explicitly consented to ICSID jurisdiction, including under Article 22.\n\n50.\n\nThey request the Tribunal to render the Decision that they requested previously in their Counter-Memorial.\n\n**E. The Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAt the hearing held on 27 July, 2010, Venezuela maintained and developed its objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n52.\n\nIt first submits that \"the sole issue facing the Tribunal under the Netherlands BIT is whether the Cemex Venezuela S.A.C.A. shares are an investment... 'of' the Claimants for the purposes of Article 9.1 of the treaty as well as Articles 2 through 8 of the treaty.\"37 It recognizes that the BIT gives \"broad protection to indirect investments,\"38 and that \"shares held indirectly are an investment.\"39 However, it stresses that \"that does not answer the issue that is before us today which is; who has the right to sue to vindicate the rights with respect to those investments?\"40 In this regard, Venezuela states that \"the ordinary and natural meaning of the possessive, 'of,' is once [sic] own.\"41 It adds that this is confirmed by the Spanish version of Articles 2 and 3. Thus only direct investors have *jus standi* under the BIT. This solution is compatible with the decision taken by the ICSID Tribunal in *Mobil v. Venezuela.* In the present case, Vencement, as a direct investor, would have had standing to sue Venezuela. This is not the case for Cemex Caracas and Cemex Caracas II.\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 27 July, 2010 (\"Hearing Transcript\") at p. 11.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 27.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 29.\n\nHearing Transcript at pp. 26-27.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 18.\n\n53.\n\nWith respect to Article 22 of the Investment Law, the Respondent refers to the Decision on Jurisdiction rendered in the *Mobil v. Venezuela* case. It adds that Article 22 must be construed in its political and legal context. It contends that, in adopting Article 22, Venezuela \"was reaffirming its commitment to existing treaties, which had a meaning, particularly in the political context of 1999, and in addition was offering this option of utilizing domestic remedies when appropriate.\"42 It finally stresses that \"it is important that this issue be addressed\"43 by the Tribunal.\n\nHearing Transcript at pp. 58-59.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 61.\n\n54.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimants also maintained and developed their previous submissions. They reaffirmed that \"the Tribunal could reach a conclusion on the BIT without touching Article 22, and the Claimants would have a complete case to present on the merits.\"44\n\nHearing Transcript at pp. 69-70.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants then submit that, to be covered by the BIT, \"an investment must belong to a national.\" It does not limit the meaning of \"National.\" It does not limit the meaning of \"Investment.\"45 Indirect investments, as well as direct investments, are investments for the purpose of Article 1(a) of the Treaty, as shown by an unbroken chain of ICSID cases. They explain the reasons for the absence of Vencement from this proceeding and agree with the Respondent that this absence will not raise any procedural problem with respect to access to documents and possible counter-claims.46 Moreover, \"there is no overlapping claim by Vencement and there is an agreement that there cannot be a double recovery here.\"47\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 71.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 160.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 95.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants finally contend that Article 22 of the Investment Law unambiguously provides for consent to ICSID arbitration. In any event, that article must be interpreted as a unilateral declaration under international law. It must thus be \"read in a natural and reasonable way, as it stands, and having regard to the words used, and due regard to the intentions of the State.\"48 In the light of the law, its historical context and its legislative history, the interpretation given by the Claimants to that text must prevail.\n\nHearing Transcript at pp. 111-12.\n\n**III. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\n58.\n\nAccording to Article 25, consent by both parties to a dispute is thus an indispensable condition for jurisdiction to exist. Such consent can be given through direct agreement between the host State and the investor. Under ICSID case law, it may also result from a unilateral offer by the host State, expressed in its legislation or in a treaty, which is subsequently accepted by the investor.\n\n59.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants submit that Venezuela consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre through:\n\n(a) Article 22 of Venezuelan Decree No. 356 on the Promotion and Protection of Investments of October 3, 1999 (the \"Investment Law\"); and\n\n(b) The Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed at Caracas on 22 October, 1991 (the \"BIT\", the \"Treaty\" or the \"Dutch Treaty\").\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent objects to both of these alleged bases of jurisdiction.\n\n61.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimants add that, \"Respondent's Various Breaches of the Investment Law Are Also Violations of the BIT,\"49 and, in particular, of its Articles 6(b), 3(1) and 3(4). Accordingly they submit that all of their claims \"will fall within the consent embodied in Article 9 of the BIT, even if jurisdiction is lacking under Article 22 of the Investment Law.\"50 The Tribunal could thus \"reach a conclusion on the BIT without touching Article 22.\"51 By contrast, the Respondent contends that \"it is important for the Republic\" and \"for the integrity of this process\"52 that, in any event, both issues be addressed by the Tribunal.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 101.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 189.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 69.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 61.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it cannot conclude that all of the alleged breaches of the Investment Law would also be violations of the BIT without an in-depth analysis of the Investment Law and the Treaty, which would be inappropriate at the present stage of the proceeding. It thus considers that it is its duty to address both issues.\n\n**A. Article 22 of the Investment Law**\n---------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nArticle 22 of the Investment Law reads as follows:\n\n\"Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pa\u00eds de origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de la cuales sean aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constituvo del Organismo Multilateral de Garant\u00eda de Inversiones (OMGI-MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados (CIADI), ser\u00e1n sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los t\u00e9rminos del respectivo tratado o acuerdo, si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer uso, cuando proceda, de las v\u00edas contenciosas contempladas en la legislaci\u00f3n venezolana vigente\".\n\n64.\n\nTranslated into English, Article 22 could read as follows:\n\n\"Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or disputes to which the provisions of the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States (ICSID) are applicable, shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.\"53\n\nTranslation provided by the Tribunal. Other translations have been proposed both by the Claimants (**see**, **e.g.**, Request for Arbitration \u00b6 34; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 130; Rejoinder \u00b6 74) and by the Respondent (**see**, **e.g.**, Memorial at p. 9, fn 32 and \u00b6 63; Reply \u00b6 53). The words \"si as\u00ed lo establece\" have been translated as \"should it so provides,\" \"if it so provides\" or \"if it so establishes\". Those variations seem immaterial to the Parties and to the Tribunal.\n\n65.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the interpretation to be given to Article 22. The Claimants submit that Venezuela consented to ICSID jurisdiction under that article. The Respondent contends that the text does not provide such consent.\n\n66.\n\nIn order to clarify the meaning of Article 22, the Tribunal will first determine the standard of interpretation to be used and will then apply that standard to Article 22.\n\n**1. Standard of Interpretation**\n---------------------------------\n\n(a) Determination of the Standard\n---------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Respondent contends that \"[a]part from the language of the statute itself, the Investment Law, as part of the law of Venezuela, must be interpreted in the light of Venezuelan legal principles\"54 and, in particular, of Article 4 of its Civil Code. \"While Venezuelan Law may not be dispositive... it plays an important role in the analysis of that statute.\"55 It adds that, under Venezuelan law, consent to arbitration must be clear, express and unequivocal. It further refers to a judgment rendered on those bases by the Supreme Court of Venezuela on 17 October, 2008. It submits that \"[t]he decision of the Supreme Court is a definitive statement of Venezuelan law at the national level and its reasoning, while not binding on an international tribunal, is entitled to due consideration by this Tribunal.\"56\n\nMemorial \u00b6 55.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 57.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 78.\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, submit that \"The Question of Whether Article 22 of the Investment Law is a 'Consent' is a Question of International Law.\"57 According to the Claimants, an ICSID Tribunal is the judge of its own competence and the decision of the Venezuelan Supreme Court is not binding on the Tribunal. They further add that the decision in question is unpersuasive.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 57.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that, under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, it is \"judge of its own competence.\" This is the case whatever may be the basis of that competence, including a unilateral offer made in the Host State's legislation and subsequently accepted by the investor, as has been recognized by ICSID Tribunals in a number of cases.58\n\n*E.g.*, *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (14 Apr. 1988), \u00b6 60; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (Award) *,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26 (2 Aug. 2006), \u00b6\u00b6 212-13; *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Republic of Georgia* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1 (24 Jan. 2003), \u00b6 339.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that the same solution has been adopted by the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice which have made clear that a sovereign State's interpretation of its own unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is not binding on the tribunal or determinative of jurisdictional issues.59 Thus the interpretation given to Article 22 by Venezuelan authorities or by Venezuelan courts cannot control the Tribunal's decision on its competence.\n\n*Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria* (Preliminary Objections), PCIJ, Ser. A/B No. 77 (1939); *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* (Greece v. Turkey) - 19 December, 1978 - ICJ Reports 1978, p. 3; *Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - 4 December 1998 - ICJ Reports 1988, p. 432.\n\n71.\n\nAnother issue is whether Article 22 must be interpreted according to Venezuelan rules of interpretation or according to international rules of interpretation. ICSID case law on that point is rare and lacks consistency.\n\n72.\n\nIn a number of cases, ICSID tribunals have had to apply national laws that were so clear that neither the parties nor the tribunal felt it necessary to expressly take a position on the rules of interpretation to be applied. This was the case for the Albanian Investment Law in *Tradex Hellas v. Albania*,60 for various Salvadorian Laws in *Inceysa v. El Salvador*,61 for the Kazakh Foreign Investment Law in *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan*,62 and for the Tanzanian Investment Law in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania.*63 However, in three other cases, ICSID tribunals dealt explicitly with the question of the rules of interpretation to be applied to unilateral offers made by Host States.\n\n*Tradex Hellas S.A.v. Republic of Albania* (Decision on Jurisdiction) *,* ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2 (24 Dec. 1996), \u00b6 79.\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (Award) *,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26 (2 Aug. 2006), \u00b6\u00b6 212-13, 310, 316, 327 and 332.\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telelomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16 (29 July, 2008), \u00b6\u00b6 333-35.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22 (24 July, 2008), \u00b6 329.\n\n73.\n\nIn *SPP v. Egypt*, the tribunal noted that \"[t]he jurisdictional issue in this case involves more than interpretation of municipal legislation. The issue is whether certain unilaterally enacted legislation has created an international obligation under a multilateral treaty. Resolution of this issue involves both statutory interpretation and treaty interpretation.\" \"Thus in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case, law n\u00b043 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation, taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.\"64 However, one must note that in the rest of the decision, the part played by those different norms is not easy to identify.65\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (14 Apr. 1988), \u00b6 61.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (14 Apr. 1988). Paragraph 74 of the award again refers to the three standards mentioned in paragraph 61. However, paragraph 94 only mentions \"general principles of statutory interpretation\" and paragraph 107 only refers to the interpretation to be given to \"unilateral declarations\" in international law.\n\n74.\n\nIn *CSOB v. Slovak Republic,* the ICSID tribunal had to decide whether it had jurisdiction both under a BIT and under a notice published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic. It stated on both grounds that \"the question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is governed by international law as set out by Article 25(1) of the ICSID convention.\"66 Then it observed that \"[e]ven if the Notice were to be characterized as a unilateral declaration by the Slovak State, it still needs to be asked whether it was 'the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms' as required by the international law principles applicable to unilateral declarations.\"67 It answered that question in the negative.\n\n*\u010ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic* (Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4 (24 May, 1999), \u00b6\u00b6 35-6 and 46.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 46.\n\n75.\n\nFinally, in *Zhinvali v. Georgia*, the tribunal took a third approach. Considering the Georgian Investment Law, it said that it was \"dealing with an internal statute rather than a bilateral agreement.\" It observed that \"if the national law of Georgia addresses this question of consent, which the Tribunal finds that it does, then the Tribunal must follow that national law guidance, but always subject to ultimate governance by international law.\" It added that Georgian law was \"in keeping with any international law principles that may be applicable\" and on the basis of the law thus interpreted, it concluded that the claimant and the respondent did consent to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of ICSID.68\n\n*Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Republic of Georgia* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1 (24 Jan. 2003), \u00b6 339.\n\n76.\n\nFrom this review of ICSID case law, it results that in four cases, the question was not dealt with. In *SPP v. Egypt*, the tribunal decided to apply \"general principles of statutory interpretation,\" \"taking into consideration relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.\" In *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*, the Tribunal took its decision only on the basis of the latter principles. In *Zhinvali v. Georgia*, it opted for domestic law \"subject to ultimate governance by international law.\"\n\n77.\n\nThe hesitations of ICSID tribunals on that question result from the fact that, in those ICSID cases, the State's consent to arbitration was not contained in a treaty to be interpreted according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May, 1969, but in a unilateral offer made by that State in one form or another.\n\n78.\n\nThe International Court of justice had to face that very problem when interpreting unilateral declarations made by States under Article 36(2) of its Statute. It observed that:\n\n\"A declaration of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, whether there are specified limits set to that acceptance or not, is a unilateral act of State sovereignty. At the same time, it establishes a consensual bond and the potential for a jurisdictional link with the other States which have made declarations pursuant to Article 36(2) of the Statute and makes a standing offer to the other States party to the Statute which have not yet deposited a declaration of acceptance.\"69\n\nAccordingly, such an \"international instrument must be interpreted by reference to international law.\"70\n\n*Land and Maritime Boundaries between Cameroon and Nigeria*, Preliminary objections - ICJ Reports 1998 p. 291 \u00b6 25; *Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 453 \u00b6 46.\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 64 and 68.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal shares this analysis. Unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction are standing offers made by a sovereign State to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Such offers could be incorporated into domestic legislation or not. But, whatever may be their form, they must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and to the principles of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.\n\n(b) Content of the Standard\n---------------------------\n\n80.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that the parties to the dispute \"consent in writing\" to submit that dispute to the Centre. Under Article 25, consent in writing is thus necessary, but the text does not give any further indication about either the manner or timing of such consent or the way in which it must be interpreted.\n\n81.\n\nCustomary rules governing States' unilateral declarations in international law have never been codified. However, as recognized by the International Law Commission of the United Nations,71 a basic distinction must be drawn in that field between:\n\n(a) declarations formulated in the framework and on the basis of a treaty, and\n\n(b) other declarations made by States in the exercise of their freedom to act on the international plane.\n\nReport to the General Assembly of 2006, Document A/CN.4/L.703 dated 20 July, 2006, \"Guiding Principles Applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States Capable of Creating Legal Obligations,\" \u00b6 3.\n\n82.\n\nBoth declarations may have the effect of creating international obligations. However, when considering declarations not made within the framework and on the basis of a treaty, the utmost caution is required when deciding whether or not those declarations create such obligations. The International Court of Justice faced situations of that kind in the *Nuclear Tests* cases in 1974.72 In those cases, it decided that \"when States make statements by which their freedom of action is to be limited, a restrictive interpretation is called for.\" In 2006, in the *Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of The Congo*, it confirmed that \"a statement of this kind can create legal obligations only if it is made in clear and specific terms.\"73 The International Law Commission adopted the same position in its Guiding Principles of 2006 Applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States.74\n\n*Nuclear Tests* - New Zealand v. France - Judgment of 20 December 1974, ICJ Reports 1974, pp. 472-73, \u00b6 47.\n\n*Armed Activities on the Territory of The Congo* (New Application, 2002) (Democratic Republic of The Congo v. Rwanda), ICJ Reports, 2006, p. 28 \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nDocument A/CN.4/L.703 dated 20 July, 2006, \"Guiding Principles Applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States Capable of Creating Legal Obligations,\" \u00b6 7.\n\n83.\n\nRules of interpretation are, however, somewhat different when, as in the present case, unilateral declarations are formulated in the framework of a treaty and on the basis of such a treaty.\n\n84.\n\nThose rules have been fixed by the International Court of Justice in a long series of cases, when interpreting unilateral declarations of compulsory jurisdiction made under Article 36(2) of its Statute.\n\n85.\n\nThe Court first stated that \"[t]he regime relating to the interpretation\" of those declarations \"is not identical with that established for the interpretation of treaties by the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties.\"75 It then stressed that every declaration \"must be interpreted as it stands, having regard to the words actually used.\"76\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 453 \u00b6 46.\n\n*Anglo-Iranian Oil Co*. -- Preliminary objections - Judgment - ICJ Reports 1952, p. 105.\n\n86.\n\nAt the same time, since declarations are unilaterally drafted instruments, \"the Court has not hesitated to place a certain emphasis on the intention of the depositing State.\"77 Similarly, in *SPP v. Egypt*, the ICSID tribunal decided that: \"[i]n interpreting a unilateral declaration that is alleged to constitute consent by a sovereign State to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal, consideration must be given to the intention of the government at the time it was made.\"78.\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 454 \u00b6 48.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (14 Apr., 1988), \u00b6 107.\n\n87.\n\nAccordingly, the International Court of Justice interprets \"the relevant words of a declaration including a reservation contained therein in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned.\"79 The Court does so by starting with the text and, if the text is not clear, by giving due consideration to the context and examining the \"evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.\"80 Thus the intention of the declaring State must prevail. It could be \"defeated or nullified\" only by a defect \"so fundamental that it vitiated the instrument by failing to conform to some mandatory legal requirement.\"81\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 454 \u00b6 49.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Temple of Preah Vihear* - ICJ Reports 1961, p. 21.\n\n88.\n\nIt is on the basis of those rules of international law that the Tribunal will now proceed to interpret Article 22 of the Investment Law.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal must add that although domestic law and the international law of treaties are not controlling or dispositive, it does not mean that they should be completely ignored:\n\n(a) As stated in the preceding paragraphs, when tribunals interpret unilateral declarations, they must have due regard to the intention of the State having made the relevant declarations. In this respect, domestic law may play a useful r\u00f4le, in particular when consent to jurisdiction has been given through national legislation.\n\n(b) Although the law of treaties as codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is not relevant in the interpretation of unilateral declarations, the provisions of the Vienna Convention may \"apply analogously to the extent compatible with the *sui generis* character\" of such declarations.82\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v.Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 453 \u00b6 46.\n\n**2. Interpretation of Article 22**\n-----------------------------------\n\n(a) The Text of Article 22\n--------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe starting point in the interpretation of unilateral declarations (as well as in statutory interpretation or in the interpretation of treaties) is the textual analysis of the document to be construed. Thus the Tribunal will thus first consider the words used in Article 22.\n\n91.\n\nAccording to Article 22, disputes arising under Venezuela's BITs or to which either the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (\"MIGA Convention\") or the ICSID Convention is applicable \"shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides\" (\"si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece\").\n\n92.\n\nThe Parties agree that this provision creates an obligation to go to arbitration subject to certain conditions and, in particular, subject to the last condition thus incorporated in Article 22. But they disagree on the interpretation to be given to the words \"if it so provides.\"\n\n93.\n\nFor the Claimants, \"[t]he reference to 'it' is, in this context, incontestably a reference to the ICSID Convention.\"83 Thus \"Article 22 is a binding direction that the State must submit to international arbitration all controversies to which the ICSID Convention applies.\"84 Article 22 \"expresses an immediate, fully operative consent, conditional only upon the jurisdictional criteria of the ICSID Convention being 'established,' as they no doubt are here. Accordingly the Centre has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 22 of the Investment Law.\"85\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 130.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 127.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 133.\n\n94.\n\nBy contrast, Venezuela contends that \"Article 22 does not itself constitute a general consent to ICSID arbitration of all investment-related disputes between the Republic and foreign investors from Contracting States, but instead requires such disputes to be submitted to arbitration according to the terms of the ICSID Convention only 'if it so provides' \u2014 meaning, *inter alia,* that consent to ICSID arbitration of a particular dispute or class of disputes has been given in writing both by the Republic and the investor.\"86 In the absence of such written consent, the Centre has no jurisdiction in the present case.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 65.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 22 consists of one single long sentence of some complexity. As stated by Professor Christoph H. Schreuer in his well known commentary on the ICSID Convention, this Article \"is drafted in ambiguous terms and is likely to give rise to difficulties of interpretation, notably as to whether it contains an expression of Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration or not.\"87\n\nC. Schreuer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" Second Ed., Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 363.\n\n96.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal first notes that Article 22 concerns:\n\n(a) disputes arising between Venezuela and an international investor whose country of origin has a BIT in force with Venezuela;\n\n(b) disputes to which the provisions of the MIGA Convention are applicable;\n\n(c) disputes to which the ICSID Convention is applicable.\n\n97.\n\nArticle 22 covers those disputes subject to two conditions.\n\n98.\n\nFirst, the text specifies that the disputes shall be submitted to arbitration \"according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement.\" On this point, the Tribunal notes that, at the outset, Article 22 mentions \"treaty or agreement\" on the promotion and protection of investments, and then, the MIGA and ICSID Conventions. One could have expected that, at the end of the article, the text would similarly have referred to the \"respective treaty, agreement or convention.\" It does not do so. However the Tribunal observes that the term \"treaty\" is a comprehensive one and normally includes \"conventions.\"88 It further notes that this is not contested by the Parties. It accordingly considers that, in Article 22 *in fine*, the words \"treaty and agreement\" also cover the two Conventions.\n\nArticle 2 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties defines a treaty as \"an international agreement between two states in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation.\" *See also* Jean Salmon, *Dictionnaire de Droit International Public*, p. 1088.\n\n99.\n\nOne then reaches the second condition resulting from the words \"si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece\" (if it so provides), on which the Parties disagree.\n\n100.\n\nGrammatically, it is undisputed that the word \"it\" refers to the preceding words \"treaty or agreement\", which, as stated above, include the ICSID Convention.\n\n101.\n\nThe difficulty is with the word \"lo\" (so). This word certainly refers to the preceding words \"shall be submitted to international arbitration.\" However, it could be interpreted in two ways. It could mean:\n\n(a) If the treaty, agreement or convention provides for international arbitration; or\n\n(b) If the treaty, agreement or convention creates an obligation for the State to submit disputes to international arbitration.\n\n102.\n\nBoth interpretations are grammatically possible. In the first case, the word \"lo\" (so) refers to international arbitration. In the second case, it refers to the obligation to submit disputes to international arbitration.\n\n103.\n\nIn a number of cases concerning unilateral declarations, the International Court of Justice decided that it \"cannot base itself on a purely grammatical interpretation of the text.\"89 Facing an ambiguous and obscure text, which has no natural meaning, the Tribunal is in a similar situation and has to look further.\n\n*Anglo-Iranian Oil Co -* Preliminary Objections - ICJ Reports 1952, p. 104; *Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 454 \u00b6 47.\n\n(b) The Principle of *Effet Utile*\n----------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants invoke the principle of *effet utile (ut res magis valeat quam* *pereat).*\n\n105.\n\nThey submit that \"[w]hen the Investment Law was enacted in October of 1999, Venezuela was already a party to the ICSID Convention. Therefore, it would serve no purpose to enact a statute providing that disputes 'shall' be submitted to ICSID arbitration, unless the intention was for those words to indicate a binding offer of arbitration;\"90 \"under the doctrine of *l'effet utile,* Article 22 should... be interpreted as Venezuela's binding consent to ICSID arbitration.\"91\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 143.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 145.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent opposes this view. It contends that \"[t]he function of article 22 is not to establish new rights for international investors, but rather to acknowledge and confirm the commitments of the Republic to submit disputes to international arbitration in accordance with its treaty obligations.\"92 Such acknowledgment and confirmation has an *effet utile*.\n\nReply \u00b6 59.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, as recognized by the International Court of Justice, \"the principle of effectiveness has an important role in the law of treaties.\"93 As stated by the tribunal in the *Eureko v. Poland* case, \"[i]t is a cardinal rule of interpretation of treaties that each and every clause of a treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than meaningless.\"94 The International Court of Justice95 and ICSID Tribunals96 have applied that principle in a number of treaty cases.\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada), ICJ Reports 1998, p. 455 \u00b6 52.\n\n*Eureko B. V. v.

Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13 (9 Nov. 2004) \u00b6 95.\n\n108.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether it is also applicable in the interpretation of States' unilateral declarations, such as offers resulting from legislation of the kind invoked in the present case.\n\n109.\n\nAs far as the Tribunal knows, this question as such has not been dealt with by ICSID tribunals.97\n\nIn *SPP v. Egypt*, the Tribunal applied the principle of **effet utile** as a general principle of statutory interpretation. *See* *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (14 Apr. 1988), \u00b6 94. It does not mention **effet utile** in its interpretation of the text as a unilateral declaration. *See, id.,* \u00b6 107.\n\n110.\n\nBy contrast, the International Court of Justice has taken a position on the issue, at least twice, when interpreting the text of declarations of compulsory jurisdiction made under Article 36(2) of its Statute. In 1952, in *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.*, the Court recognized that the principle of *effet utile* \"should in general be applied when interpreting the text of a treaty.\" But it added that \"the text of the Iranian Declaration is not a treaty resulting from negotiations between two or more States. It is the result of unilateral drafting by the government of Iran.\"98 As a consequence, the Court interpreted the declaration on the basis of the intention of Iran and did not adopt the British argument based on the principle of *effet utile.*99\n\n*Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.* (United Kingdom v. Iran), ICJ Reports 1952, p. 16.\n\nAcademic comments on that solution are rather rare. However, one may note that in his course in the Hague Academy of International Law in 1965, Professor Berlia, after having analysed the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.* judgment, added that: \"La logique du raisonnement est d'une force suffisante pour que l'on consid\u00e8re sans imprudence que le r\u00e9gime particulier des actes unilat\u00e9raux sur ce point est \u00e9tabli.\" *See also,* Study of M. Fartache, Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de droit international public, 1952, p. 593.\n\n111.\n\nMore recently, in 1988, the Court was required to construe a reservation made by Canada to its jurisdiction in a similar declaration. The Court noted that it \"was addressed by both Parties on the principle of *effectiveness.*\" It stated that: \"[c]ertainly, this principle has an important role to play in the law of treaties and the jurisprudence of this Court; however, what is required in the first place for a reservation to a declaration made under Article 36(2) of the Statute is that it should be interpreted in a manner compatible with the effect sought by the reserving State.\"100 The Court did not examine any further the arguments of the Parties based on the principle of *effet utile.*\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v.Canada), ICJ Reports 1998, p. 455, \u00b6 52.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with those rulings of the International Court of Justice. Thus in order to interpret Article 22, it will consider its context, its purpose and the circumstances of its preparation in order seek to determine what was the intention of Venezuela when adopting Article 22.\n\n113.\n\nHowever, it will add that, even if the principle of *effet utile* were applicable to unilateral declarations, this would not help in the interpretation of Article 22.\n\n114.\n\nIn this respect one must recall that this principle does not require that a maximum effect be given to a text. It only excludes interpretations which would render the text meaningless, when a meaningful interpretation is possible. Thus, in a number of cases, the International Court of Justice, when interpreting agreements or treaties, has given a very limited effect to the text it had to construe. In the *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* case, the Court decided that the agreed communiqu\u00e9 invoked by Greece did not give jurisdiction to the Court. It added that \"it is for the two Governments to consider... what effect, if any, is to be given to [this text] in their further efforts to arrive to an amicable settlement of the dispute.\"101 In three other cases, the Court had to interpret bilateral treaties providing for \"firm and enduring peace and sincere friendship\" between the Contracting States or using comparable formulae. It construed those provisions as fixing only an \"objective in the light of which the other treaty provisions are to be interpreted and applied.\"102\n\n*Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* (Greece v. Turkey), ICJ Reports 1978, p. 44, \u00b6 108.\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1986, p. 136 \u00b6 273; *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), ICJ Reports 1996 (II), p. 814 \u00b6 28; *Case concerning certain questions of mutual assistance in criminal matters,* (Djibouti v. France), Judgment of 4 June 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 110-11.\n\n115.\n\nIn the present case, one must recall that Article 22 covers three types of treaties.\n\n(a) First it mentions the MIGA Convention which contains a clause providing for compulsory arbitration. The Tribunal observes that the only possible effect of this mention is to recall and confirm the existing obligations of Venezuela in this regard.\n\n(b) Then it covers disputes between Venezuela and international investors whose country of origin has a BIT in effect with Venezuela. In this respect the Tribunal notes that all BITs concluded by Venezuela before the entry into force of the Investment Law contained a provision for compulsory arbitration. Article 22 recalls and confirms those existing commitments. This is not denied by the Claimants, but they contend that Article 22 could also have the effect of providing for compulsory arbitration of disputes arising under future Venezuelan BITs, which would not contain a provision to that end. However, such an interpretation implies that Venezuela could in the future prefer consenting to ICSID jurisdiction through Article 22, without any limitation and reciprocity, rather than concluding BITs with appropriate clauses providing for compulsory arbitration. The Tribunal is not convinced that such a possibility is realistic and was contemplated by Venezuela in 1999.\n\n(c) It thus appears that, for the MIGA Convention and for BITs, the only possible effect of Article 22 is to recall and confirm the existing obligations of Venezuela.\n\n(d) With respect to disputes to which only the ICSID Convention is applicable, Venezuela submits that has the same effect, whereas the Claimants contend that it imposes new obligations on the Respondent. Under the first interpretation, Article 22 has a limited effect. By contrast, under the second interpretation, it has far reaching consequences. But, even under the first interpretation, it has some effect, as recognized by an ICSID Tribunal in respect of another domestic law of that type.103 It is not meaningless. Accordingly, even if the principle of *effet utile* were applicable to unilateral declarations (which is not the case), it would be of no use to this Tribunal in the choice to be made between those two interpretations.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22 (24 July, 2008).\n\n(c) Context and Purpose\n-----------------------\n\n116.\n\nWith respect to the context, the Parties first diverge on the meaning of Article 1 of the Investment Law. The Claimants submit that the stated object and purpose of the Law as set forth in Article 1 is \"'to provide investments and investors... with a stable and foreseeable legal framework....' In furtherance of this goal, the Law contains a comprehensive and far reaching set of investment protections and guarantees typically found in modern BITs... But these rights potentially depend on the mechanism of Article 22 providing the means by which rights might be vindicated in a neutral forum.\"104 The availability of such a forum is thus a critical means whereby the purpose of the Investment Law is achieved. This is the object of Article 22 as interpreted in the light of Article 1.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 140.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, contends that the purpose of the Investment Law, as stated in Article 1, was not \"economic opening and liberalisation,\" but \"national development.\"105 It observes that the premise of Claimants' argument is that \"the Investment Law's purposes cannot be achieved without ICSID Arbitration as a 'neutral forum'... That policy judgment is not reflected in the Law itself.\"106\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 49.\n\nReply \u00b6 57.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, according to Article 1, the Investment Law was \"intended to provide investments and investors, both domestic and foreign, with a stable and predictable legal framework in which the former and the latter may operate in a secure environment, through the regulation of actions by the State, towards these investments and investors, in order to achieve the increase, diversification and harmonious integration of investments to advance the objectives of national development.\"\n\n119.\n\nSuch aims are in general terms comparable to those of treaties on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments and are reflected in the Investment Law itself. Thus, the Investment Law contains provisions relating to fair and equitable treatment (Article 7(1)), non discrimination (Article 8), confiscations and expropriations (Article 11), which are comparable to those incorporated in BITs. However, the rights thereby accorded to international investors are often qualified in order not to affect the application of Venezuelan Law or the rights of Venezuelan investors. Moreover, Article 24 of the Investment Law specifies that its provisions do not prevent the adoption by Venezuela of a number of measures that it enumerates, *inter alia*, for national security, the conservation of natural resources and the integrity and stability of the Venezuelan financial system.\n\n120.\n\nThe Investment Law is thus in some respect different from BITs. Moreover, BITs do not always contain a compulsory arbitration clause. It is true that a clause of that kind was incorporated in the seventeen BITs concluded before 1999 by Venezuela. But this does not imply that Venezuela was ready to accept such an obligation vis-\u00e0-vis States with which it had no BIT. One cannot draw from Article 1 and from the Law as a whole the conclusion that Article 22 must be interpreted as establishing consent by Venezuela to submit to arbitration all potential disputes falling within the ambit of the ICSID Convention.\n\n121.\n\nThe Parties then discuss the consequences to be drawn from the fact that Article 22 is inserted into Chapter IV of the Law, which is entitled \"Dispute Resolution\" and contains three Articles, namely, Articles 21 to 23. The Claimants contend that, if Article 22 were only meant as an abstract affirmation of the principles of arbitration, it would not be inserted in that chapter \"between two provisions full of operative and mandatory content.\"107 The Respondent arrives at a contrary conclusion: it stresses that, if Venezuela had intended to give unilateral standing consent to ICSID Arbitration in Article 22, it would have retained clearer formulae, like those used in Articles 21 and 23.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 79.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that it can draw no conclusion, one way or another, from the fact that Article 22 is inserted into a chapter relating exclusively to the settlement of disputes. It further notes that Article 21 concerns interstate disputes. Under that Article, those disputes are first to be resolved through diplomatic means. Article 21 adds that, if no agreement is thus reached, Venezuela shall \"foster\" the submission of the controversy to an arbitration tribunal under conditions to be agreed upon with the other State. Article 23 concerns investors not covered by Article 22. It provides that: \"[a]fter the administrative avenues have been exhausted by the investor, any dispute arising in relation with the application of this Decree-Law, may be submitted to the Domestic Courts or to the Venezuelan Arbitration Tribunals, at the investor's election.\" Those Articles thus concerns disputes different from those covered by Article 22. They provide some flexibility for other types of dispute settlement mechanisms. They can be of no help in the interpretation of Article 22.\n\n123.\n\nThe Parties further seek to interpret the Investment Law in the wider context of Venezuela's attitude vis-\u00e0-vis arbitration. The Respondent submits that \"international arbitration was long disfavored in Venezuela\"108 and recalls the \"historical antipathy\"109 of that country to arbitration. The Claimants do not deny this, but stress that a \"tectonic shift\" in favour of international arbitration took place in the nineties.110\n\nMemorial \u00b6 65, fn. 87.\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 61.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 104-05; Hearing Transcript at p. 123. *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 157.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that Venezuela had some experience of arbitration at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that generated hostility in this country towards this form of settlement of disputes.111 This reluctant attitude explains why, during the preparation of the ICSID Convention, Latin-American countries, including Venezuela, expressed reservations regarding the proposed text which, they said, contravened their constitutional principles.112 It also explains why Venezuela signed the Convention only in 1993, almost thirty years after its adoption.\n\nThe boundaries of Venezuela with Colombia and the now Republic of Guyana were fixed at that time by two arbitral awards favorable to its neighbors, the validity of which was contested. Moreover, as a consequence of a military intervention by Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, Venezuela had to accept the establishment of Mixed Commissions in charge of fixing indemnities to be paid to foreign creditors. Those events led to the formulation of the Drago doctrine prohibiting the use of force for the recovery of contractual debts and the Calvo clause under which investors commit themselves not to ask for diplomatic protection by their State of origin.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention - Volume II(1) \u00b6 39.\n\n125.\n\nAt that time, the environment in Venezuela had become more favorable to international arbitration. In 1993, the Respondent ratified both the ICSID Convention and the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 10 June 1958 (the \"New York Convention\"), as well as the MIGA Convention. From 1991 to 1999, it signed and ratified seventeen BITs. Finally it adopted the Investment Law of 1999. However, even at that time, Venezuela remained reluctant to engage in contractual arbitration in the public sphere, as shown by the 1998 Law on commercial arbitration and Article 151 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, during that period, Venezuela signed and ratified a number of treaties relating to international arbitration in the field of investments and, in particular, concluded many BITs. Moreover, since 1999, Venezuela has ratified eight more BITs, thus confirming its will to be bound by such treaties. However, the Tribunal cannot draw from this general evolution the conclusion that Venezuela, when adopting Article 22, intended to give in advance a general consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of any Treaty. For a State to commit itself through treaties creating reciprocal obligations is one thing; to commit itself unilaterally without counterpart is another.\n\n(d) Legislative History\n-----------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe legislative history of Article 22 could in this respect provide more useful information about the intention of the drafters of the Investment Law113. However, the Investment Law of 1999 was a decree-law and, as such, was not discussed in Parliament. Moreover it contains no \"*exposici\u00f3n de motivos.*\" Thus we have no direct information about its preparation.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.* (United Kingdom v. Iran), Judgment of 22 July, 1952 - ICJ Reports 1952, pp. 104-07; *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* case - Judgment of 17 December, 1978 - ICJ Reports, pp. 26-43.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 22 was intended by its drafters as a \"Binding Offer of ICSID Arbitration.\"114 In this respect, they first refer to a public statement made by President Chavez one day before his election. However in this statement, President Chavez only states that Venezuela needs private international investments and that he had no intention to nationalize anything. Such a general statement is not of great assistance in the interpretation of Article 22.\n\nCounter-Memorial at p. 73.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimants then refer to various papers published by M. Werner Corrales Leal, \"one of the drafters of the Investment Law.\"115 By contrast, the Respondent stresses that Mr. Corrales \"was not the legislator\"116 and that, in any case, his statements are misconstrued by the Claimants.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 135-37.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 72.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in 1999, Mr. Corrales was the Representative of Venezuela to the World Trade Organisation. In a communication made at a conference on investment arbitration in comparative law organized in April 2009 by the Caracas Centro Empresarial de Conciliaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje (Caracas Business Center of Conciliation and Arbitration), Mr. Corrales stated that he had advised in 1999 that the President of Venezuela should prepare a law \"that would serve as the compulsory framework for all international treaties and negotiations on investments.\" He said that he was then entrusted with preparing \"reference terms to write the draft law and direct the preparation thereof.\" He added that the \"legal drafting\" was assigned to a legal consultant of the Institute of Foreign Trade, Mr. Gonzalo Capriles.117\n\nSpeech by Ing. Werner Corrales at CEDCA's event - Investment Arbitration in Comparative Law - 28 April 2009 - Business - June 2009, pp. 78-80.\n\n131.\n\nSoon after the publication of the Investment Law, Mr. Corrales in two articles gave \"algunas ideas\" (some ideas) on the legal regime for promotion and protection of investments in Venezuela. In those articles, he stated that in his \"opinion, a regime applicable to foreign investments must leave open the possibility to resort to international arbitration [unilaterally], which today is accepted almost everywhere in the world, whether through the mechanism provided for by the ICSID Convention or through the submission of the dispute to an international tribunal or to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal as the one proposed by UNCITRAL. In any case, it must be clearly established that there may not be simultaneous resorting to national courts and to the arbitration mechanism or to any other type of procedure of settlement of disputes. In our case this subject is dealt with in chapter IV (Articles 21-23)\" of the Investment Law, \"where a great part of the principles commented is accepted.\"118\n\nLa OMC como espacio normativo, pp. 185-86. The word \"unilaterally\" did not appear in the first article of 30 April, 1999. It was added to the second article in 2000.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, in those articles, Mr. Corrales expressed his opinion on the principles which, according to his judgment, must be incorporated in any international arbitration regime. He added that a \"great part\" of those principles \"is accepted in Articles 21 to 23 of the Investment Law.\" He did not say that this was the case for all of the principles that he favored and he did not say that the drafters of Article 22 intended to provide for consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of any BIT.\n\n133.\n\nMoreover, at the same time, Mr. Juan de Jes\u00fas Montilla, then Minister of Production and Trade, stated to the contrary that, under the Investment Law, \"the solution in the case of controversies or disputes where it is set forth that these shall be resolved in national courts or within a framework of acknowledgment of the commitments that have been undertaken in international agreements.\"119\n\nJuan de Jes\u00fas Montilla, La pol\u00edtica de atracci\u00f3n de IED en Venezuela, Finanzas, inversi\u00f3n y crecimiento, Revista Cap\u00edtulos, n\u00b059, Sistema Econ\u00f3mico Latinoamericano y del Caribe (Mayo-Agosto 2000).\n\n134.\n\nTen years later, at the above-mentioned conference organized by the Caracas Centro Empresarial de Conciliaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje, Mr. Corrales was invited by the organisers of the conference to inform the audience of the \"drafter's intention\" for the Law. He then stated that his purpose, as \"co-drafter\" of the Law, \"was to offer in the broadest and most transparent manner the possibility of the investors resorting to international arbitration as a unilateral offer made by the Venezuelan State.\"\n\n135.\n\nThis last statement was made at a time that the present proceedings were already pending. It is not supported by contemporaneous written documents and the Claimants did not ask Mr. Corrales to appear in the proceeding as a witness. The Tribunal cannot draw from such a statement the conclusion that in adopting the Investment Law, Venezuela intended to consent in general and in advance to ICSID arbitration.\n\n136.\n\nBoth Parties then refer to academic publications relating to the Investment Law. The Tribunal has carefully examined those publications. It observes that all of them were written after 2005, at a time when controversies had already emerged between Venezuela and foreign investors, and also that most of them refer to the proceedings pending either in the Supreme Court of Venezuela or within ICSID. They add nothing to the arguments exchanged by the Parties in the present case.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal finally notes that, at the time of the adoption of the Investment Law, Venezuela had already signed and ratified seventeen BITs stating either that Venezuela gave \"its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes\" to ICSID arbitration or that its disputes with foreign investors \"shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to ICSID,\" or using both phrases. Comparable words were used in some national laws and in the ICSID model clauses. If it had been the intention of Venezuela to give its advance consent to ICSID arbitration in general, it would have been easy for the drafters of Article 22 to express that intention clearly by using any of those well known formulae.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal thus arrives at the conclusion that such an intention has not been established. As a consequence, it cannot conclude from the obscure and ambiguous text of Article 22 that Venezuela, in adopting the 1999 Investment Law, consented unilaterally to ICSID arbitration for all disputes covered by the ICSID Convention in a general manner. That article does not provide a basis for jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present case.\n\n139.\n\nFinally the Tribunal observes that, according to the Respondent, the \"Claimants Have Not Given Their Consent To Jurisdiction Under the Investment Law\"120 and that they \"Are Not 'International Investors Under [that] Law.\"121 It submits that, for those reasons also, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in the present case. However, as the Tribunal has arrived to the conclusion that Article 22 does not constitute consent to jurisdiction by Venezuela, it does not have to take a decision on those alternative objections to jurisdiction.\n\nMemorial at p. 25.\n\nMemorial at p. 53.\n\n**B. Article 9 of the BIT between the Netherlands and Venezuela**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nOn 22 October, 1991, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed an Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1st November 1993, after ratification by both Parties. That agreement was \"done in the Spanish, Netherlands and English languages, the three of them being equally authentic.\" However, under paragraph 3 of a Protocol signed on the same day, \"[i]n case of difference of interpretation between the three equally authentic texts of the present Agreement, reference shall be made to the English text.\"\n\n141.\n\nParagraph 1 of Article 9 of the BIT provides that \"[d]isputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this agreement in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under\" the ICSID Convention. Article 9 adds that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\"\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the BIT to consider the case. The Respondent denies this. It recalls that \"[t]he claims made by the Claimants arise from the Republic's nationalization of their indirect subsidiary, Cemex Venezuela, S.A.C.A. (\"CemVen\") in connection with the 2008 restructuring of major cement producing companies in Venezuela.\" It describes the complex corporate form used for this investment and submits that \"the Claimants, as indirect investors in CemVen, did not have any investment in the territory of Venezuela which gave rise to the treaty obligations allegedly breached by the Republic.\"122\n\nMemorial \u00b6 4.\n\n143.\n\nThe first Claimant, Cemex Caracas (sometimes referred to as Cemex Caracas I) was incorporated in 1999 as a Dutch *Besloten Vennootschap.* It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cemex Espa\u00f1a S.A., which, in turn, is an indirect subsidiary of Cemex S.A.B. de C.V., a Mexican company with worldwide operations.\n\n144.\n\nThe second Claimant, Cemex Caracas II, was also incorporated in the Netherlands in 2001 as a Dutch *Besloten* Vennootschap. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cemex Caracas. Cemex Caracas II is the owner of 100% of a Cayman Islands company, called Vencement Investments (Vencement), which in turn owns 75.7% of Cemex Venezuela (CemVen).\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent observes that Article 1(b)(iii) of the BIT \"defines a 'national' to encompass entities owned or controlled by citizens or companies organized under the laws of The Netherlands or Venezuela,\"123 and notes that this is an expansive definition. It adds that Article 1(a) also gives a broad definition to the term \"investment\" which includes \"every kind of asset.\" Accordingly it recognizes that the Claimants, as well as Vencement, must be deemed to be Dutch nationals under the BIT.124 It also recognizes that the shares owned by Vencement in CemVen are an investment within the meaning of the Treaty.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 31.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 26.\n\n146.\n\nIt stresses however that the BIT \"makes no reference whatsoever to the subject of ownership or control, whether 'direct or indirect,' or to the location of the investments or the manner in which investments may be made.\"125 Thus the treaty \"does not grant standing to nationals of a Contracting Party who do not themselves have investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Those nationals indirectly receive the benefits of the treaty because their controlled entities are entitled to assert claims for alleged violations of the obligations of the Contracting Party in which they have investments. Accordingly, Claimants are not proper parties to this proceeding.\"126\n\nMemorial \u00b6 27.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 43 (emphasis in the original).\n\n147.\n\nVenezuela, in other terms, submits that the BIT covers investments in the territory of one contracting Party of nationals \"of\" the other Contracting Party. In the present case, the shares of CemVem are an \"investment of Vencement [which] has *jus standi* and the right to sue.\"127 They are not directly owned by the Claimants and cannot be considered as an investment \"of\" the Claimants under the BIT. As indirect investors, the Claimants have no \"*ius standi* to assert claims under the Dutch Treaty.\"128\n\nHearing Transcript at p. 39.\n\nReply \u00b6 49.\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, recall that the definition of investment in the BIT is broad and non exhaustive. They submit that \"the treaty text, its context, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and *all* arbitral jurisprudence unanimously support the conclusion that the BIT covers indirect investments.\"129 Thus the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claim under the Treaty.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 5.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that a number of ICSID decisions and awards have considered the question of \"indirect investments.\" In most cases, the question was raised by the respondent State when a local company was owned or controlled by a Claimant through another company. Two questions then may arise. First, the tribunal may have to decide whether the Claimant has *jus standi.* Second it may have to decide whether and to what extent the Claimant may claim compensation for damages suffered by the local company. At the present stage, this Tribunal is only faced with the first issue.\n\n150.\n\nThe BIT defines investments in Article 1(a). This text provides that:\n\n\"For the purpose of this Agreement:\n\na. the term \"investment\" shall comprise every kind of assets and more particularly though not exclusively:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights *in rem* in respect to every kind of assets;\n\n(ii) rights derived from shares, bonds, and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;\n\n(iii) titles to money, to other assets as well as to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(iv) rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill and know-how;\n\n(v) rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.\"\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investments in the BIT, and in particular in Article 1(a). It also notes that the definition of investment given in that article is very broad. It includes \"every kind of assets\" and enumerates specific categories of investments as examples. One of those categories consists of \"shares, bonds or other kind of interests in companies and joint ventures.\"\n\n152.\n\nIn a comparable case, *Siemens v. Argentina,* the ICSID Tribunal observed that \"there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the [German/Argentine BIT]. The definition of 'investment' is very broad. An investment is any kind of asset considered to be under the law of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made. The specific categories of investment included in the definition are included as examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters were careful to use the words 'not exclusively' before listing the categories of 'particularly' included investments. One of the categories consists of 'shares, rights of participation in companies and other type of participation in companies'. The plain meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German shareholder are protected under the Treaty. The Treaty does not require that there be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company. Therefore a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.\"130\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. Argentina* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8 (3 Aug. 2004), \u00b6 137.\n\n153.\n\nThe same solution was adopted on the same ground by several ICSID tribunals. This was the case in *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*,131 which interpreted the BIT between Greece and Georgia. This was also the case in *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru*, which interpreted the BIT between Peru and China.132 This was finally the case in *Mobil v.Venezuela*, interpreting the BIT between the Netherlands and Venezuela.133\n\n*Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* (Decision on Jurisdiction) *,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18 (6 July, 2007), \u00b6\u00b6 123-24.\n\n*Tza Yap Shun v. Republic of Peru* (Decision on Jurisdiction) *,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6 (19 June, 2009), \u00b6\u00b6 106-11 (where the Tribunal based its decision on the text of Article 1 of the BIT, the intention of the Parties to promote and protect investments and the absence of an express limitation in the Treaty).\n\n*Mobil Corporation and Others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (Decision on Jurisdiction) *,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27 (10 June, 2010), \u00b6\u00b6 162-66.\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this jurisprudence is not so well established. In support of this contention, it references the award rendered on 21 April, 2006 in *Berschader v. Russian Federation*.134 However in that award, the Tribunal, faced with a text comparable to Article 1(a) stated that \"the wording of the Treaty does not exclude and therefore leaves open the possibility that an investment made indirectly by the investor in the territory of the other Contracting Party is encompassed by the terms of Article 2.1.\"135 Thereafter, the Tribunal construed a specific provision of the Treaty concerning the nationality of the intermediary and concluded that the provision prohibited indirect investments through companies incorporated in the investors' home State (a question which is not relevant to the present case).\n\n*Berschader v. Russian Federation* (Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Case No. 080/2004).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6137.\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, even if a BIT covers indirect investments, this does not give *jus standi* to indirect investors. It stresses that this solution is even more justified when, as in the present case, the BIT uses broad definitions of \"nationals\" and \"investments,\" and thus allows direct investors easily to initiate arbitral proceedings.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as acknowledged by the Respondent, investments as defined in Article 1 of the BIT could be direct or indirect. By definition, an indirect investment is an investment made by an indirect investor. As the BIT covers indirect investments, it necessarily entitles indirect investors to assert claims for alleged violations of the Treaty concerning the investments that they indirectly own.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, when the BIT mentions investments \"of\" nationals of the other Contracting Party, it means that those investments must belong to such nationals in order to be covered by the Treaty. But this does not imply that they must be \"directly\" owned by those nationals. Similarly, when the BIT mentions investments made \"in\" the territory of a Contracting Party, all it requires is that the investment itself be situated in that territory. It does not imply that those investments must be \"directly\" made in such territory.\n\n158.\n\nThus, as recognized by several arbitral tribunals in comparable cases, the Claimants have *jus standi* in the present case. The Respondent's objection to the Tribunal jurisdiction under the BIT cannot be upheld.\n\n**C. Costs of the Proceedings**\n-------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal makes no order at this stage regarding the costs of the proceeding and reserves this question to a later stage of the arbitration.\n\n**IV. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides:\n\na. That it has jurisdiction over the claims presented by Cemex Caracas and Cemex Caracas II as far as they are based on alleged breaches of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments concluded on 22 October, 1991 between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela;\n\nb. That it has no jurisdiction under Article 22 of Venezuelan Decree No. 356 on the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 3 October, 1999;\n\nc. To make the necessary order for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4); and\n\nd. To reserve all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the Parties for subsequent determination."}]}
