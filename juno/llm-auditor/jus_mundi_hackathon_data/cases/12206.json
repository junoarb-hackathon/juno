INTRODUCTION AND THE PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns claims brought by (i) Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd, (ii) International Mainstream Renewable Power Limited, and (iii) Mainstream Renewable Power Group Finance Ltd, three private companies limited by shares incorporated in Ireland, and (iv) Horizont I Development GmbH, (v) Horizont II Renewable GmbH, and (vi) Horizont III Power GmbH, three limited liability companies incorporated in Germany (together, the \"**Claimants**\"), against the Federal Republic of Germany (\"**Germany**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The dispute was submitted by the Claimants to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute arises out of regulatory measures taken by the Respondent regarding its wind energy regime, which allegedly affected the Claimants' wind energy projects, resulting in a loss to their investments.\n\n3.\n\nThis ruling concerns the Respondent's preliminary objection pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 30 April 2021, the Centre received the Claimants' Request for Arbitration of that same date.\n\n5.\n\nOn 13 May 2021, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institution Rule 6.\n\n6.\n\nOn 14 September 2021, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Ms. Wendy Miles QC, a national of New Zealand, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Dr. Charles Poncet, M.C.L., a national of Switzerland, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. Antol\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a, a national of Spain, appointed by the Respondent. Ms. Martina Polasek, ICSID Deputy Secretary-General, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nFollowing correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal, by email of 22 September 2021 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would be held on 26 October 2021.\n\n9.\n\nOn 12 October 2021, the Respondent filed its Application under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, together with Legal Authorities RL-0001 through RL-0010 (the \"**Rule 41(5) Application**\" or the \"**Application**\").\n\n10.\n\nBy email of 15 October 2021 transmitted by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult and revert by 19 October 2021 with joint or separate proposals concerning the briefing schedule for the Application. The Tribunal also reminded the Parties that, as provided by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), the Tribunal must notify its decision on the Application at the first session or promptly thereafter; therefore, given the imminent timing of the first session, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider either a postponement of the first session or an extension of the time limit for the Tribunal's decision on the Application.\n\n11.\n\nBy emails of 19 October 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to the following: (i) the Claimants would file their observations on the Application on 22 October 2021; (ii) during the first session, the Parties would discuss with the Tribunal whether it requires further written or oral submissions on the Application; and (iii) the Tribunal would notify the Parties of its decision on the Application as soon as reasonably practicable following the first session, with a reasoned decision to follow at a later date. The Parties' agreement was subsequently approved by the Tribunal on 20 October 2021.\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to the Parties' agreement, on 22 October 2021, the Claimants filed their Observations on the Application (the \"**Observations**\"), together with Exhibits C-0034 through C-0039 and Legal Authorities CL-0003 through CL-0023.\n\n13.\n\nOn 26 October 2021, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by videoconference. During the first session, the Tribunal determined that each Party would file a second round of submissions on the Application, with the Respondent's submission due on 5 November 2021 and the Claimants' submission due on 15 November 2021.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, on 5 November 2021, the Respondent submitted its response on the Application (the \"**Reply Observations**\"), together with Legal Authorities RL-0011 through RL-0013; the Claimants submitted their observations thereto (the \"**Rejoinder Observations**\") on 15 November 2021, together with Factual Exhibits C-0040 through C-0042 and Legal Authorities CL-0024 and CL-0025.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThis section provides a summary of the Parties' positions as set out in their written submissions. The Tribunal's summary is necessarily not an exhaustive account of the written pleadings. The Tribunal has reviewed the Parties' respective submissions carefully and in their entirety.\n\n**A.** **T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **P****osition**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIt is the Respondent's position that its case on jurisdiction is a \"*clear and obvious case*\" that only allows for one conclusion and therefore is manifestly without legal merit within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal manifestly lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the present dispute due to the incompatibility of the relevant parts of Article 26 of the ECT with the EU Treaties.1\n\nApplication, Secs. B-C; Reply Observations, Secs. A.I-A.V.\n\n18.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent argues that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants \u2013 *i.e.*, Horizont I Development GmbH, Horizont II Renewable GmbH and Horizont III Power GmbH, respectively \u2013 are incorporated in Germany and therefore do not qualify as protected investors.2\n\nApplication, paras. 2, 191; Reply Observations, Sec. A.VI.\n\n**(1) The Legal Standard under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nAs to the applicable legal standard pursuant to Rule 41(5), the Respondent submits that \"*[i]n order to be '*manifestly*' without legal merit, the alleged claim must be plainly without merit as a matter of law*\".3 It further \"*recognizes that this standard requires a high degree of clarity that the claims as presented cannot succeed as a matter of law*\".4\n\nApplication, para. 17.\n\nApplication, para. 17.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"*it is not necessary to conduct an in-depth inquiry into the facts of the case in order for the Tribunal to appreciate the legal defect of the claim*\",5 that \"*[a]ll impediments raised by Respondent are legal in nature*\",6 and \"*[t]he factual predicate for Respondent's objections are assumed to be undisputed*\".7\n\nApplication, para. 19.\n\nApplication, para. 19.\n\nApplication, para. 19.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon the standard accepted in *Trans-Global v. Jordan*, requiring a \"*clear and obvious case*\".8 It further relies on *Trans-Global v. Jordan* in support of its submission that the \"*exercise to decide upon the matter might require some level of sophistication*\", citing to *Trans-Global* award in support as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal considers that these legal materials confirm that the ordinary meaning of the word requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and dispatch. The standard is thus set high. Given the nature of investment disputes generally,* ***the Tribunal nonetheless recognizes that this exercise may not always be*** *simple, requiring (as in this case) successive rounds of written and oral submissions by the parties, together with questions addressed by the tribunal to those parties.* ***The exercise may thus be complicated****; but it should never be difficult.*9\n\nApplication, para. 189; *Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25, Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008 (\"***Trans-Global v. Jordan***\") (**CL-0004**), paras. 86 (*see* fn. 5), 92.\n\nApplication, para. 20, fn. 5; *Trans-Global v. Jordan* (**CL-0004**).\n\n22.\n\nThe proof for Respondent's arguments, it argues, is readily available and does not need extensive taking of evidence.10 The Respondent submits that while its arguments require a comprehensive analysis of international law, including EU law, they are not difficult to comprehend and allow only one conclusion for this Tribunal: to reject the Claimants' claims for lack of jurisdiction.11\n\nApplication, para. 189.\n\nApplication, paras. 20, 190.\n\n23.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent further relies on *Global Trading v. Ukraine*, which it notes \"*discussed both factual evidence and complex legal issues to reach a conclusion on the legal merits of the claim*\".12\n\nApplication, para. 21, fn. 6; *Global Trading Resources Corp. and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11, Award, 1 December 2010 (\"***Global Trading v. Ukraine***\") (**CL-0005**).\n\n**(2) Article 26 of the ECT and the EU Treaties**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAs to the substance of its Application, the Respondent argues that a clause consenting to investor-State arbitration in a treaty between European Union (\"**EU**\") Member States is incompatible with the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the \"**EU Treaties**\"). This includes the ECT insofar as relationships among EU Member States are concerned. It further argues that because of this incompatibility, the relevant consent clause in the ECT, Article 26, cannot be a valid basis of consent to arbitration in investor-State disputes between Irish investors and Germany, both EU Member States, including in the present dispute.\n\n***a. Factual Basis of the Objection***\n---------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the basis of its jurisdictional objection is very clear and has been \"*widely discussed in arbitration circles*\".13 It submits that the EU Commission and the CJEU have stated their position on EU law leading to the inapplicability of arbitration clauses to intra-EU relations in an unambiguous manner.14 The EU Member States, including Respondent, have taken the necessary political and legal steps to comply with the CJEU's findings.15\n\nApplication, para. 188.\n\nApplication, para. 188.\n\nApplication, para. 188.\n\n26.\n\nIn that regard, the Respondent sets out what it describes as the factual basis of its objection, which comprises a summary of events and instruments from 2009. The Respondent submits that these make manifestly clear that an investor-State arbitration clause in a treaty between two or more EU Member States is incompatible with these States' obligations under the EU Treaties and include the following:16\n\n(i) 2009 Lisbon Treaty;\n\n(ii) 2015 EU Commission's infringement proceedings against EU Member States;\n\n(iii) 2016 Non-paper by Germany and a number of other EU Member States concerning intra-EU investment;\n\n(iv) 6 March 2018 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"**CJEU**\") in Case C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV* (the \"***Achmea*** **Judgment**\");17\n\n(v) intra-EU arbitration after the *Achmea* Judgment;\n\n(vi) 2018 EU Commission's communication \"Protection of intra-EU investment\";18\n\n(vii) January 2019 Declaration by EU Member States on the Legal Consequences of the *Achmea* Judgment and on Investment Protection in the EU;19\n\n(viii) Council of European Union's Decision regarding Negotiations on the Modernization of the ECT;\n\n(ix) May 2020 EU Proposal regarding the ECT Modernization;\n\n(x) May 2020 Termination Agreement regarding Intra-EU BITs; and\n\n(xi) 2 September 2021 judgment of the CJEU in Case C-741/19, *Republic of Moldova* v. *Komstroy LLC* (the \"***Komstroy*** **Judgment**\").20\n\nApplication, Sec. B.\n\n*Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, CJEU Case C-284/16, Judgment, 6 March 2018 (**RL-0004**).\n\nEC, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, \"Protection of intra-EU investment\", 19 July 2018 (**RL-0005**).\n\nDeclaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, \"On the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union\", 15 January 2019 (**RL-0006**).\n\n*Republic of Moldova* v. *Komstroy LLC*, CJEU Case C-741/19, Judgment, 2 September 2021 (**RL-0007)**.\n\n27.\n\nIn the Respondent's submission, these events and instruments establish beyond any doubt that Article 26 of the ECT is \"*not applicable to intra-EU arbitration*\".21\n\nApplication, para. 92.\n\n***b. Legal Basis of the Objection***\n-------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent submits that because of the alleged incompatibility of the investor-State arbitration clause in the ECT with the EU Treaties, Article 26 of the ECT is \"*not applicable*\".22 Consequently, there would not have been a valid offer to arbitrate at any relevant time in these proceedings and this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.23 The Tribunal must take account of this incompatibility and its consequences *ex officio*.24\n\nApplication, paras. 92-95.\n\nApplication, para. 94.\n\nApplication, para. 93.\n\n29.\n\nIn support of this conclusion, the Respondent advances three arguments: (i) the interpretation of the ECT; (ii) recent legal developments in the EU; and (iii) the lack of an arbitration agreement pursuant to private law based on the common will of the Parties. These are detailed in turn below.\n\n*(i) No jurisdiction based on the interpretation of the ECT*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent's first argument is that the interpretation of the ECT in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\") leads to the conclusion that there is no valid offer to arbitrate by the Respondent. Under Article 10 of the ECT, each Contracting Party to the ECT guarantees favourable treatment to investors of other Contracting Parties to the ECT. The Respondent argues that since the ECT treats the EU and its Member States as a single entity, the reference to \"*other contracting parties*\" in the ECT can only refer to third (non-EU) States.25\n\nApplication, para. 97; Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\") (**CL-0001**), Arts. 1(10)(b) (\"[\u2026] *With respect to a Regional Economic Integration Organisation which is a Contracting Party, Area means the Areas of the member states of such Organisation, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organisation*\") and 10.\n\n31.\n\nBoth the investors' home State and the host State of the investment were EU Member States at the time they ratified the ECT. The Respondent argues that the extent of these States' commitments to arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT must therefore be determined by an interpretation of the ECT in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, specifically Article 31(1) of the VCLT.26 Neither the ordinary meaning of the ECT's terms nor the context, object and purpose of the ECT, even when taking into account the preparatory works, can be a basis for this Tribunal's jurisdiction.27\n\nApplication, para. 98.\n\nApplication, para. 100.\n\n32.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the ECT defines a \"*Contracting Party*\" as a \"[S]*tate or Regional Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by the ECT and for which that treaty is in force*\". Article 1(3) of the ECT defines a Regional Economic Integration Organization (\"**REIO**\").28 Article 1(10) of the ECT defines \"*Area*\" of a REIO as the Areas of its Member States.29 Article 36(7) of the ECT reflects the division of competences between the EU and the EU Member States.30 Article 25 of the ECT further recognizes that Contracting Parties who extend certain trade and investment liberalization to one another by virtue of an Economic Integration Agreement like the EU Treaties, are not required by the ECT to extend the same benefits to non-EIA States.31\n\nApplication, para. 104; ECT (**CL-0019**), Art. 1(3) (\"[\u2026] *organisation constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by* [the ECT]*, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters*\").\n\nApplication, para. 107; ECT (**CL-0019**), Art. 1(10) (\"[\u2026] *With respect to a Regional Economic Integration Organisation which is a Contracting Party, Area means the Areas of the member states of such Organisation, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organisation*\").\n\nApplication, para. 105; ECT (**CL-0019**), Art. 36(7) (\"*A Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall, when voting, have a number of votes equal to the number of its member states which are Contracting Parties to* [the ECT]*; provided that such an Organisation shall not exercise its right to vote if its member states exercise theirs, and vice versa*\").\n\nApplication, para. 112.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the ECT foresees the possibility that a Contracting Party is bound only for parts of the ECT, namely for the parts for which it enjoys international competence.32 In that regard, the Respondent contends that:\n\n*The ECT thus recognizes that the EU Member States have transferred competence over matters governed by the ECT to the EU, including the authority to take binding decisions for the EU Member States in respect of those matters. Thereby, the signatories to the ECT acknowledge that the competence for concluding the ECT is shared between the EU and the EU Member States. Furthermore, the ECT recognizes that the EU corresponds to its parts (because it has a number of votes equal to its parts), and that each acts only in the matters falling under its competence. For the EU, EU Member States and the EU are therefore not bound for the entirety ECT, but each for its respective competences.*33\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Contracting Parties to the ECT signed the ECT on the mutual understanding that it would not apply to an intra-EU situation.34\n\nApplication, para. 103.\n\nApplication, para. 106.\n\nApplication, para. 114.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the ECT's context and object and purpose lead to the same conclusion. Even though, in theory, EU Member States have the international capacity to enter into *inter se* obligations when negotiating a multilateral agreement for those areas of the agreement for which they retain competence, they, in practice, never do.35 The preparatory work to the ECT and the circumstances of its conclusion confirm the goal of integrating the energy sectors of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe with those of the \"*Western world*\", including the EU, USA, Canada and Norway.36 It was understood by all Contracting Parties that the EU Member States did not intend to create *inter se* obligations between them.37\n\nApplication, para. 119.\n\nApplication, para. 116.\n\nApplication, para. 126.\n\n35.\n\nIn addition, even if supplementary means of interpretation are resorted to, the conclusion remains the same.38\n\nApplication, paras. 127-139.\n\n*(ii) No jurisdiction based on the recent legal developments in EU law*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent's second argument is that, even if the Tribunal does not follow its interpretation of the intent of the Contracting Parties to the ECT *ab initio*, in light of the progressive developments of EU Treaties and EU law (*see above*, **Section (2)a)**), especially the *Komstroy* Judgment,39 the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.40 These progressive developments include: (i) changes to EU law following the Lisbon Treaty leading to the inapplicability of Article 26 of the ECT; (ii) the *Komstroy* Judgment having sealed the debate that ECT arbitration is not available for intra-EU ECT-based investor-State arbitration; and (iii) political developments since 2018.\n\nApplication, paras. 172-177.\n\nApplication, Sec. II.\n\n37.\n\n*First*, the Respondent sets out the process by which it submits that changes to EU law following the Lisbon Treaty led to the inapplicability of Article 26 as follows:\n\na. the Respondent and investors' home State are both parties to the ECT and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\") and their relationship is governed by the more recent treaty (Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT);41\n\nb. EU Treaties have a dual nature under international law, including as the basis for EU law under international law and, as between EU Member States, to underpin the establishment under international law of the supranational union;42\n\nc. the general requirement for EU Member States to make use of all means available to ensure that treaties concluded with third countries under international law do not violate EU law (Article 351(2) of the TFEU),43 applies *a fortiori* in cases where agreements concluded between EU Member States are incompatible with EU law;44 and\n\nd. in 2009, the Respondent and investors' home State both adopted changes to EU law following the Lisbon Treaty,45 which effectively modified the ECT as between EU Member States (Article 41(1)(b) of the VCLT).46\n\nApplication, para. 148.\n\nApplication, para. 149.\n\nApplication, para. 151.\n\nApplication, para. 152. This special conflict rule that EU Treaties take absolute precedence over agreements that Member States has concluded been recognized for instance in the Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission on *Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law*: Application, para. 153; M. Koskenniemi, \"Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law\" (International Law Commission, 2006) (**C-0039**), para. 283.\n\nApplication, para. 147.\n\nApplication, para. 158.\n\n38.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent submits, as the ECT is the elder of the treaties concluded under international law, with regard to EU Member States it has been superseded by the more recent Treaty on European Union (\"**TEU**\") and TFEU and the provisions therein.47 According to Article 351(1) of the TFEU, only such agreements shall not be affected by EU law which an EU Member State has entered into with one or more non-members of the EU, before its accession to the EU.48 This means that, if two States are both parties to a pre-accession treaty and to the EU Treaties, in case of incompatibility between the two, it is the later EU Treaties that apply, in conformity with Article 30(3) VCLT.49\n\nApplication, para. 166.\n\nApplication, para. 167.\n\nApplication, para. 167; *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, para. 4.189 (available at: (https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1071clean.pdf) (\"*Subject to the several assumptions above* [\u2026] *the Tribunal concludes that Article 307 EC* [now Article 351 of the TFEU] *precludes inconsistent pre-existing treaty rights of EU Member States and their own nationals against other EU Member States; and it follows* [\u2026] *that EU law would prevail over the ECT's substantive protections and that the ECT could not apply inconsistently with EU law to such a national's claim against an EU Member State*\").\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the conflict rule in Article 16 of the ECT is \"*not applicable since intra-EU disputes are not within its scope of application*\".50 Even if it were applicable, it submits that it would not lead to a precedence of the ECT over EU law since the EU Treaties represent \"*a more favorable developed legal system which offers more forms of protection than the ECT does*\".51\n\nApplication, para. 170.\n\nApplication, para. 170.\n\n40.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent sets out the basis upon which it submits that the *Komstroy* Judgment deals the debate. It refers to the *Komstroy* Judgment where the CJEU concluded as follows:\n\n*In the light of the foregoing, it must be concluded that Article 26(2)(c) ECT must be interpreted as not being applicable to disputes between a Member State and an investor of another Member State concerning an investment made by the latter in the first Member State.*52\n\nApplication, para. 176; *Komstroy* Judgment, para. 66.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the CJEU judgment is a binding interpretation of EU law, which applies to all EU Member States.53 Therefore, the position that only intra-EU investor-State arbitration based on BITs violates EU law cannot be upheld.54\n\nApplication, para. 175.\n\nApplication, para. 177.\n\n42.\n\nThe CJEU further confirmed its analysis in its 26 September 2021 judgment in the *Poland v. PL Holdings* case (the \"***PL Holdings*** **Judgment**\").55 The Respondent submits that \"*the CJEU even took it one step further, declaring all* ad hoc *intra-EU arbitration inadmissible as well*\".56 It submits that, based on that judgment:\n\n[\u2026] *that ad hoc arbitration clearly was no different than arbitration under a BIT. Hence, the possibility for a Member State to bring an action before an arbitral body through an ad hoc arbitration agreement, showing the same characteristics as an arbitration clause in a BIT, violates Art. 4 (3) TEU and Art. 267, 344 TFEU in the same way as an arbitration clause contained in a BIT, or the ECT, for that matter.*57\n\nApplication, para. 184; Reply Observations, paras. 25-34; *Republic of Poland v. PL Holdings S\u00e0rl*, CJEU Case C-109/20, Judgment, 26 October 2021 (\"***PL Holdings*** **Judgment**\")\u00a0(available at: https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=248141&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&m ode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=26155384).\n\nReply Observations, para. 30.\n\nReply Observations, para. 32.\n\n43.\n\n*Third*, as to political developments since the 2018 *Achmea* Judgment, the Respondent refers to two recent instruments as follows:\n\na. January 2019 Declaration, signed by the investors' home State, the Respondent and 20 other EU Member States, which contained statements as to the nature of the ECT and its systemic interpretation precluding intra-EU investor-State arbitration,58 demonstrating the shared understanding of the signatories regarding the interpretation of the ECT,59 and, which confirms that the ECT should have always been interpreted according to this understanding;60 and\n\nb. May 2020 Termination Agreement, which provides that new arbitration proceedings are those initiated after 6 March 2018, the day of the *Achmea* Judgment.\n\nApplication, para. 179.\n\nApplication, para. 179.\n\nApplication, para. 179.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the present arbitration, registered with ICSID on 13 May 2021, qualifies as a new arbitration within the meaning of the May 2020 Termination Agreement.61 It contends that the Tribunal is bound by the will of the Contracting Parties and therefore should take into account the Declarations and Agreements in accordance with Articles 31(2)(b) and 31(3)(a) of the VCLT and terminate these proceedings accordingly.62\n\nApplication, para. 181.\n\nApplication, para. 180.\n\n*(iii) No jurisdiction based on the common will of the Parties*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there are no grounds to argue that the Respondent accepted the Tribunal's jurisdiction by not objecting to it in a timely manner, unlike the findings of other tribunals, such as the tribunal in *PL Holdings*.63 The Respondent raised concerns as to jurisdiction in its very first submission dated 7 June 2021.64\n\nReply Observations, paras. 25-34; *PL Holdings* Judgment, paras. 44-45.\n\nApplication, para. 186.\n\n46.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal cannot base its jurisdiction on the common will of the Parties to the dispute expressed in an arbitration agreement concluded *inter se*,65 because \"[t]*here is no agreement to arbitrate based on private law*\",66 and \"*no valid arbitration agreement between the Parties in accordance with Article 25(2) ICSID Convention*\".67\n\nApplication, para. 186.\n\nApplication, para. 186.\n\nApplication, para. 4.\n\n*(iv) No jurisdiction based on private law*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn its Reply Observations, the Respondent further submits that pursuant to Article 5 of the VCLT any relevant rules of an international organization take precedence over any general rule of public international law.68\n\nReply Observations, paras. 40-44.\n\n48.\n\nArticle 5 of the VCLT provides:\n\n*The present Convention applies to any treaty which is the constituent instrument of an international organization and to any treaty adopted within an international organization* *without prejudice to any relevant rules of the organization**.*69\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") (**CL-0017**), Art. 5 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the term \"*rules of the organization*\" comprises both written rules and rules emanating from established organizational practice,70 and any conflict rules contained in the constituent instrument of an international organization.71 Therefore, the primacy rule applies to the EU Treaties at international level and endows them with *lex specialis* status vis-\u00e0-vis other rules of conflict. It is irrelevant whether the conflicting treaty was concluded before or after the EU Treaties, and whether or not it contains its own conflict rules.72 It would therefore be erroneous to assume applicability of Article 26(4) of the ECT by relying on an alleged structural dichotomy between EU primary law and international law.73\n\nReply Observations, para. 43; O. D\u00f6rr and K. Schmalenbach (eds.), *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary* (Springer, 2018) (\"**VCLT Commentary**\") (**RL-0012**), para. 15; United Nations, *Conference on the Law of Treaties* (Vienna, 26 March to 24 May 1968), Official Records (1969) UN Doc A/CONF.39/11 **(RL-0013**), paras. 31, 40.\n\nReply Observations, para. 43; VCLT Commentary (**RL-0012**), para. 16.\n\nReply Observations, para. 46.\n\nReply Observations, para. 47.\n\n50.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent argues that the general international law of treaties, in particular the application of its conflict of law rule in Article 5 of the VCLT, leads to the inapplicability of Article 26 of the ECT in an intra-EU context, including in the present case.\n\n**(3) Nationality of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent argues that Claimants Four, Five and Six \u2013 *i.e.*, Horizont I Development GmbH, Horizon II Renewable GmbH and Horizont III Power GmbH, respectively \u2013 are incorporated in Germany and are not protected investors.74\n\nApplication, para. 2.\n\n52.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants do not provide evidence that would establish Claimants Four, Five and Six being \"*Irish companies via control*\" and are thus \"*not protected investors*\".75\n\nReply Observations, paras. 55-56.\n\n**(4) Request for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal: (i) dismiss the Claimants' claims for manifest lack of jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT and in accordance with Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules; and (ii) examine *ex officio* its scope of jurisdiction, in particular taking into account the CJEU's *Komstroy* Judgment; or, in the alternative (iii) dismiss the claims of Claimants Four, Five and Six, for manifest lack of jurisdiction as being incorporated in the host State and in accordance with Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.76\n\nReply Observations, para. 57.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **C****laimants****' P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that the Rule 41(5) standard \"*requires a high degree in clarity that the claims as presented cannot succeed as a matter of law*\" as set out in *Trans-Global v. Jordan*.77\n\nObservations, para. 8.\n\n55.\n\nAs to the Respondent's first objection regarding incompatibility between Article 26 of the ECT and the EU Treaties, the Claimants argue that the Respondent misrepresents some of the instruments it relies on inaccurately and that these instruments have \"*no bearing*\" on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.78 They submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction on the basis of Article 26 of the ECT in conjunction with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.79\n\nObservations, Sec. III.\n\nObservations, Sec. IV.\n\n56.\n\nAs to the Respondent's second objection concerning the nationality of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants, the Claimants argue that, by virtue of Article 26(7) of the ECT, these Claimants were at all relevant times owned and controlled by the First, Second and Third Claimants respectively, the latter three being investors with Irish nationality.80 Consequently, all Claimants were \"*nationals of another Contracting State*\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\nObservations, para. 6.\n\n**(1) Legal Standard under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent has to overcome a \"*very high threshold*\".81 On the basis of earlier ICSID decisions, the Claimants argue that \"*manifest*\" in Rule 41(5) is equivalent to \"*obvious*\" or \"*clearly revealed to the eye, mind or judgment*\".82 Under Rule 41(5), the Respondent must establish its objection \"*clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch*\".83\n\nObservations, Sec.

Factual Basis of the Objection***\n---------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants submit that what the Respondent \"*described as the 'factual basis'*\" contains \"*certain inaccuracies*\" and significant parts of it are \"*irrelevant*' for the purpose of the Application.85 They firmly assert that Article 26 of the ECT contains a valid offer to arbitrate on the part of the Respondent.86\n\nObservations, para. 7.\n\nObservations, para. 7.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants contend that significant parts of the \"*factual basis*\" invoked by the Respondent are inaccurate or irrelevant as follows:\n\n(i) *2009 Lisbon Treaty*: has no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction because Article 207 of the TFEU, which stipulates that foreign direct investment is an exclusive EU competence, relates to the EU's external competence rather than intra-EU relations;87\n\n(ii) *2015 EU Commission's infringement proceedings against EU Member States*: have no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction because the EU Commission did not follow through with these proceedings and the CJEU did not rule;88\n\n(iii) *2016 Non-paper by Germany and a number of other EU Member States concerning intra-EU investment*: at most a policy paper that has no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction;89\n\n(iv) *Achmea Judgment*: not one tribunal, including ICSID tribunals, has denied jurisdiction on the basis of the *Achmea* Judgment both with regard to intra-EU claims under bilateral investment treaties and with regard to intra-EU claims under the ECT;90\n\n(v) *July 2018 EU Commission's Communication \"Protection of intra-EU investment\"*: is unaccompanied by any explanation as to how this policy paper would deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction;91\n\n(vi) *January 2019 Declaration by EU Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Achmea Judgment and on Investment Protection in the EU*: is \"*not a legally binding document*\",92 and \"[t]*he use of the future tense suggests that the signatories* [to the Declaration] *do not consider that their intra-EU BITs have already been terminated for invalidity of the underlying consent*\",93 and the VCLT \"*provides specific procedures in this regard, yet there is no assertion in the January 2019 Declaration that these procedures have been commenced, much less completed*\";94\n\n(vii) *Council of European Union's Decision regarding Negotiations on the Modernization of the ECT*: negotiation directives that are \"*aspirational*\"95 and contradict the Respondent's measures taken in relation to the Claimants that are the subject of the present dispute;96\n\n(viii) *May 2020 Termination Agreement regarding Intra-EU BITs*: does not cover intra-EU proceedings on the basis of Article 26 of the ECT, as admitted by the Respondent and therefore has no bearing on jurisdiction and cannot support the Application;97 and\n\n(ix) *Komstroy Judgment*: following the *Achmea* Judgment, \"*it was to be expected that the CJEU may make the finding that it did in the* Komstroy *Judgment*\",98 but \"*neither the courts of EU Member States, nor the CJEU itself, appear to follow the* Komstroy *Judgment*\",99 because two months after the *Komstroy* Judgment, the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm has not withdrawn its request for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU regarding a question on the compatibility of Article 26 of the ECT with the EU Treaties, and the CJEU has not removed the case from its docket.100\n\nObservations, para. 13.\n\nObservations, para. 14.\n\nObservations, para. 15.\n\nObservations, paras. 16-19.\n\nObservations, para. 20.\n\nObservations, para. 21.\n\nObservations, para. 22.\n\nObservations, para. 22.\n\nObservations, paras. 26.\n\nObservations, paras. 24-26.\n\nObservations, para. 27.\n\nObservations, para. 28.\n\nObservations, para. 30.\n\nObservations, para. 30.

Legal Basis of the Objection***\n-------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Interpretation of the ECT*\n-------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants submit that an interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT in accordance with the VCLT confirms that the Tribunal has jurisdiction.102 As the legal basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the present dispute, the Claimants rely on Articles 26(1) and 26(3)(a) of the ECT, which read as follows:\n\n*(1)Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*103\n\nObservations, Sec. IV.A.\n\nObservations, para. 32; ECT (**CL-0019**), Arts. 26(1), 26(3)(a).\n\n63.\n\nAs to the continued application of Article 26 of the ECT, the Claimants:\n\na. reiterate that both Germany and Ireland at all relevant times were and still are Contracting Parties;104\n\nb. submit that nothing in the language of Article 26 of the ECT suggests that its scope was intended to be restricted to disputes involving either an investor or a Contracting Party outside of the EU;105\n\nc. as to other provisions of the ECT, invoke the Decision on the *Achmea* Issue in *Vattenfall v. Germany*, which held that explicit language was necessary to support the interpretation that the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 was only to Investors from non-EU Member States;106 and\n\nd. reject that the context or object and purpose of Article 26 of the ECT can change this conclusion.107\n\nObservations, para. 34.\n\nObservations, para. 35.\n\nObservations, para. 37; *Vattenfall AB and others v. Federal Republic of Germany*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, 31 August 2018 (\"***Vattenfall v. Germany***\") (**CL-0018**), para. 182. The Claimants also allege that the Respondent's Application is \"disingenuous\" in light of its recent settlement agreement in the mentioned *Vattenfall* arbitration: Observations, para. 5(ii).\n\nObservations, paras. 38-45.\n\n*(ii) Recent EU developments and the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is Article 26 of the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and not \"*EU law*\" that are determinative of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.108 They make five arguments in that regard:\n\na. \"*EU law*\" is not applicable law pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT to determine the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\nb. there are no rules between the parties of the ECT within the meaning of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT to deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction;\n\nc. the ECT, including its Article 26, has not been superseded by the EU Treaties pursuant to Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT;\n\nd. there has been no modification of the ECT within the meaning of Article 41(1) of the VCLT that could deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction; and\n\ne. Article 351 of the TFEU does not even apply and in any event, cannot deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction.\n\nObservations, Sec. IV.B.\n\n65.\n\nRegarding the first argument, the Claimants submit that the ECT provision concerning applicable law (Article 26(6)) does not apply to the dispute settlement clause in Article 26. It applies only to the merits of a dispute between the Parties and not to issues relating to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.109\n\nObservations, paras. 50-51.\n\n66.\n\nMoreover, even if Article 26(6) of the ECT did apply, its effect would not be to incorporate EU law as part of the applicable law, based on the \"*natural and ordinary meaning*\" of the provision and the \"*context*\" in relation to other provisions of the ECT.110\n\nObservations, para. 82.\n\n67.\n\nRegarding the second argument, the Claimants assert that \"*Article 31(3)(c) VCLT requires practice that establishes rules 'between the parties' to the relevant treaty*\",111 and none of the instruments the Respondent invokes can be said to establish rules between the parties to the ECT regarding its interpretation.112\n\nObservations, para. 56.\n\nObservations, para. 56.\n\n68.\n\nRegarding the third argument, the Claimants submit that the EU Treaties do not post-date the ECT as the relevant provisions of the EU Treaties were already part of their predecessor treaty, the Treaty of Rome and the European Communities Treaty.113\n\nObservations, para. 58.\n\n69.\n\nMoreover, even if the EU Treaties were considered to be the later instrument, the EU Treaties and the ECT cannot be considered part of the same \"*treaty regime*\" and do not relate \"*to the same subject matter*\" within the meaning of Article 30(1) of the VCLT.114 In any event, the *lex specialis* conflict rules in Article 16 of the ECT prevails over the subsidiary rules in Article 30 of the VCLT.115\n\nObservations, paras. 60-61.\n\nObservations, para. 62.\n\n70.\n\nRegarding the fourth argument, the Claimants submit that Article 16 of the ECT means that there can be no modification of the ECT pursuant to Article 41(1) of the VCLT.116 The Claimants also rely on the lack of any reference in the Lisbon Treaty to the ECT or any modifications to it. In particular, there is no suggestion that the EU followed the procedures set out in Article 41(2) of the VCLT for advance notification of other ECT Contracting Parties of their intention to modify ECT obligations among EU Member States.117\n\nObservations, para. 63.\n\nObservations, para. 64.\n\n71.\n\nRegarding the fifth and final argument on this issue, the Claimants contend that Article 351 of the TFEU only concerns non-EU member States and provides no basis for the EU Treaties' precedence over other agreements concluded between EU Member States, in particular the ECT given that treaty's Article 16 *lex specialis* conflict rule.118 Consequently, the EU Treaties do not prevail over the ECT.119\n\nObservations, paras. 65-66.\n\nObservations, para. 66; *Vattenfall v. Germany* (**CL-0018**), para. 229.\n\n*(iii) Private law and Article 5 of the VCLT*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nAs to the Respondent's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction based on private law, the Claimants deal with this in their Rejoinder Observations.120 The Claimants submit that the Respondent's \"*position cannot be grounded in Article 5 VCLT and none of the Respondent's authorities has made this point*\".121 They submit that:\n\n*To the Claimant's best knowledge, no EU Member State in dozens of intra-EU investment arbitrations has ever sought to argue that an international arbitral tribunal in an intra-EU investment arbitration would not have jurisdiction by virtue of Article 5 VCLT. For good reason, because such an argument cannot reasonably be made.*122\n\nRejoinder Observations, paras. 15-20.\n\nRejoinder Observations, para. 18.\n\nRejoinder Observations, para. 18.\n\n73.\n\nThey further submit that, although Article 5 of the VCLT establishes \"*that international organisations, such as the EU, may have their own rules when it comes to determining issues such as amendment, modification and interpretation of the constituent instrument, such as the EU Treaties*\", it \"*does* *not* *have anything to say about the relationship between EU Treaties and other treaties, such as the ECT*\".123\n\nRejoinder Observations, paras. 19-20.\n\n**(3) Nationality of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants are \"*nationals of another Contracting State*\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention by virtue of Article 26(7) of the ECT since they were owned and controlled by the First, Second and Third Claimants, respectively.124\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 66, fn. 32: Extract from Share Register of the Fourth Claimant, 15 April 2021 (**C-0008**); Extract From Share register of the Fifth Claimant, 15 April 2021 **(C-0011**); Extract from Share Register of the Sixth Claimant, 15 April 2021 (**C-0013**).\n\n75.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants allege that the Respondent was in fact already aware of the First, Second and Third Claimants' respective control of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants because of its involvement in German domestic court proceedings against the same companies who are the Claimants in this arbitration.125\n\nRejoinder Observations, para. 32.\n\n**(4) Request for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal: (i) reject the Respondent's Application; (ii) consider its jurisdiction on the basis of the Parties' submissions; and (iii) order the Respondent to pay all costs and fees incurred in connection with its Application.126\n\nRejoinder Observations, para. 34.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered the Parties' written submissions arising out of the Respondent's Application pursuant to Rule 41(5) for dismissal of the claim on the ground that it is manifestly without legal merit because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\n78.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the Rule 41(5) Application, the relevant provision of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states as follows:\n\n*(5) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.*\n\n79.\n\nIt is against this Rule that the Tribunal sets out its reasoning below.\n\n**A.** **L****egal** **S****tandard under** **ICSID A****rbitration** **R****ule** **41(5)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nFirst, the legal standard established by Rule 41(5) expressly requires that the Tribunal determine the claim to be \"*manifestly without legal merit*\".\n\n81.\n\nAs to the meaning of that phrase, the Parties accept that the claim must be clearly and obviously without merit as a matter of law and that the application of the standard requires a high degree of clarity.\n\n82.\n\nPrevious decisions applied that standard in a relatively consistent manner. In *Trans- Global v. Jordan*, the tribunal said the \"*standard is thus set high*\" and \"*required the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch*\".127 It noted that \"*Rule 41(5) can only apply to a clear and obvious case*\", or to \"*patently unmeritorious claims*\".128 As to what it required by way of \"*relative ease and despatch*\", the tribunal noted that \"*this exercise may not always be simple*\".129 That tribunal further noted that this \"*may thus be complicated; but it should never be difficult*\".130\n\n*Trans-Global v. Jordan* (**CL-0004**), para. 88.\n\n*Trans-Global v. Jordan* (**CL-0004**), para. 92.\n\n*Trans-Global v. Jordan* (**CL-0004**), para. 90.\n\n*Trans-Global v. Jordan* (**CL-0004**), para. 90.\n\n83.\n\nIn *Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v Italian Republic*, the Tribunal said that \"*the Rule 41(5) procedure is not intended, nor should it be used, as the mechanism to address complicated, difficult or unsettled issues of law.*\"131\n\n*Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v Italian Republic*, Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 20 March 2017, para. 41.\n\n84.\n\nIn *Lotus v. Turkmenistan*, the tribunal required that it be \"*obvious from the submissions of the parties that there is some unavoidable and indisputable fact, or some legal objection in relation to which no possible counter-argument is identified*\". Therefore, \"[i]*f the claimant* [\u2026] *can point to an arguable case, the claim should proceed*\".132\n\n*Lotus v. Turkmenistan* (**CL-0007**), para. 158.\n\n85.\n\nThe tribunal in *PNG v. Papua New Guinea* noted that Rule 41(5) \"*is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts*\".133 It said this was because the Rule 41(5) procedure would \"*inevitably limit the Parties' opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal's opportunity to reflect*\".134\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea* (**CL-0008**), para 89.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea* (**CL-0008**), para 94.\n\n86.\n\nThis Tribunal does not understand there to be any real issue between the Parties as to the high standard legal standard imposed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). The language in previous decisions simply reiterates that clear language in the Rule; there must be a clear and obvious basis to reject the claim on the basis of lack of legal merit.\n\n**(1) Application of the Legal Standard**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent's Application arises out of a claim by investors from EU Member States against an EU host State, *i.e.*, an intra-EU investment claim. The Tribunal is required to determine whether or not the jurisdictional basis for the claim pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" on grounds of incompatibility with the EU Treaties.\n\n***a. Timeliness of the Respondent's Application***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) requires that an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit is filed \"*no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal*\".\n\n89.\n\nThis Tribunal was constituted on 14 September 2021. The Application was filed on 14 October 2021. Accordingly, the Application is within time in accordance with Rule 41(5).\n\n***b. Application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) to Jurisdiction***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nIn a 2010 article, \"*Objection Under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules*\", the author observes that the text of Rule 41(5):\n\n*does not contain the term \"jurisdiction\"; it only mentions \"preliminary objections\" and specifies that such objections should be in relation to claims that are \"manifestly without legal merit\". This silence is open to interpretation. For instance, an interpretation that Rule 41(5) permits preliminary objections to jurisdiction would be reasonable because there is no de jure basis to exclude such objections. The relevant provision of the ICSID Institution Rules, Rule 7(e), does not preclude consideration of jurisdictional issues from any stage of a proceeding. Rule 7(e) provides that \"the registration of the request is without prejudice to the powers and functions of the \u2026 Arbitral Tribunal in regard to jurisdiction, competence and the merits\"*.135\n\nApplication, para. 15, citing A. Diop, \"Objections under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules\", ICSID Review, 25 Foreign Investment Law Journal 2 (2021), pp. 321 *et seq*. (available at: https://academic.oup.com/icsidreview/article/25/2/312/632163).\n\n91.\n\nAlthough the Claimants do not dispute the application of Rule 41(5) to an objection based on jurisdictional grounds, they note that \"[t]*he very demanding standard of proof* [...] *applies no less to jurisdictional than other matters*\".136 In order to analyse how to apply that standard specifically in the context of jurisdiction, the Tribunal is assisted by the decision in *Brandes v. Venezuela.*\n\nObservations, para. 10.\n\n92.\n\nIn *Brandes*, the tribunal noted that, whilst Rule 41(5) does not mention \"*jurisdiction*\", and instead employs the term \"*legal merit*\", this wording \"*by itself, does not provide a reason why the question whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to hear and decide a claim could not be included in the very general notion that the claim filed is 'without legal merit'*\"*.*137 The tribunal then considered two other provisions in the ICSID Rules and Convention that also address threshold jurisdictional issues as follows:\n\na. Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, which limits the Secretary-General's decision whether or not to permit the case to be registered and the procedure put in motion on the basis that \"*the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre*\" to \"*the information contained in the request*\";138 and\n\nb. Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which \"*expressly addresses the issue of objections regarding the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal which have to be raised 'not later than the expiration of the time-limit for the filing of the counter-memorial'*\".139\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 50.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 51.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 46.\n\n93.\n\nThe *Brandes* tribunal contrasted Rule 41(5), which was introduced in 2006 \"*to prevent 'patently unmeritorious claims'*\" that \"*clear* [the Article 36] *jurisdictional threshold, but are frivolous as to the merits*\".140 Having noted that \"[t]*here exist no objective reasons why the intent not to burden the parties with a possibly long and costly proceeding when dealing with such unmeritorious claims should be limited to an evaluation of the merits of the case and should not also englobe an examination of the jurisdictional basis on which the tribunal's powers to decide the case rest*\",141 the tribunal accepted that this would mean that \"*there are actually three levels at which jurisdictional objections could be examined*\".142\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 47, citing A. Parra, \"The Development of the Regulations and Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\", 41 International Lawyer 1 (Spring 2007), p. 56.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 52.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 53.\n\n94.\n\nThese three levels of potential jurisdictional challenge therefore are: (i) the threshold level by the Secretariat under Article 36 of the ICSID Convention; (ii) the summary dismissal level by the tribunal under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and if it passes that level, (iii) as a preliminary jurisdictional objection (which could be heard separately or together with the merits) by the tribunal under Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n95.\n\nThe purpose of Rule 41(5) must be to enhance, rather than impede, efficient disposal of the proceedings. It could not have been intended to create two identical jurisdiction proceedings, once pursuant to Rule 41(5) and then again pursuant to Rule 41(1). What plainly differentiates Rule 41(5) is its very high standard, requiring it to be clear, obvious or patent that there is no legal dispute between the parties. Such summary dismissal requires the Tribunal largely to assume that the facts as pleaded by the Claimants are correct and find that, on the basis of those facts, there is simply and transparently no legal basis for the claim.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent must be able to show the Tribunal that the claim was lost before it left the start line. As the *Brandes* tribunal pointed out, there are \"*very short time-limits*\" under Rule 41(5), which require the objection to be raised \"*in any event before the first session of the Tribunal*\", and the decision to be notified at the \"*first session or promptly thereafter*\", having given the parties \"*the opportunity to present their observations*\".143 This further reinforces that the decision is one of summary dismissal. If the underlying factual basis is disputed and/or lack of legal merit is not clear and obvious, then a Rule 41(5) decision upholding the objection is not appropriate.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 54.\n\n97.\n\nAlthough the Claimants invoked this \"*very demanding standard of proof*\",144 they also included in their prayer for relief a request that the Tribunal \"[c]*onsiders its jurisdiction on the basis of the parties' submissions*\".145 However, though it is conceivable that in the context of a Rule 41(5) Application a tribunal could decide not only that the applicant failed to meet the \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" standard but that the objection it has raised has no legal merit at all, that is not the case here.\n\nObservations, para. 10.\n\nObservations, para. 71.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that there is a dispute between the Parties as to the compatibility of Article 26 of the ECT and the EU Treaties in relation to the Parties in the current claim. But the purpose of this decision is only to determine whether or not the Claimants' legal position is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\", as opposed to which of the Parties' legal position should ultimately prevail.\n\n***c. Respondent's So-called Factual Basis***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent's burden of proof requires it first to establish that manifest lack of legal merit is clear and obvious on the basis of largely undisputed facts. In this regard, the *Brandes* tribunal adopted the position of the claimant, that the respondent \"*must show that on the circumstances as they plausibly arise out of the Request for Arbitration, the claimant cannot be granted legal relief*\".146 It said:\n\n*A preliminary objection under Rule 41(5) is an objection based on the manifest absence of legal merit of a claim, not on the absence of a factual basis. It is therefore not necessary to prove facts, if these facts, even if proven, are not capable of supporting a claim that has no legal merit.*147\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 69.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela* (**CL-0006**), para. 70.\n\n100.\n\nIn its Application, the Respondent sets out at length (20 pages of a 47-page submission) a section entitled \"*Factual Basis of this Objection: Investment Arbitration in the EU*\".148 In their Observations, the Claimants purported to \"*address certain inaccuracies in what is described as the 'factual basis' in the Application, as well as show that significant parts of that 'factual basis' are irrelevant for the purpose of the Tribunal deciding the Application (and cannot even support Germany's case)*\".149 In further comments and reply, the Parties proceeded to debate the details and effect of events and instruments discussed in the Respondent's \"*factual basis*\", including but not limited to the effect, if any, of the recent *Komstroy* and *PL Holdings* Judgment.\n\nApplication, Sec. B.\n\nObservations, para. 12.\n\n101.\n\nAlthough the occurrence or existence of the 11 events or instruments set out at paragraph 26 above is not in issue, the accuracy of the Respondent's description of those events or instruments and their effect in the context of the Application remains firmly in issue between these Parties.150\n\nClaimants' Observations on Respondent's Application Pursuant to Rule 41(5), dated 22 October 2021, Section III.\n\n102.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Respondent has established a foundation of \"*unavoidable and indisputable fact*\" from which to proceed to determination pursuant to Rule 41(5), on the basis of the 'factual basis' as asserted in the context of the Application.151 Based on the Parties' submissions, as the description and effect of some or all of the events and instruments appears to form part of the factual basis' as asserted by the Respondent, this cannot \u2013 in light of the Claimant's objections \u2013 be considered to be a matrix of \"*uncontested facts*\", to which this Tribunal is able to apply \"*undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law*\".152\n\n*Lotus v. Turkmenistan* (**CL-0007**), para. 158.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea* (**CL-0008**), para. 89.\n\n103.\n\nIt certainly is not able to do so \"*with relative ease and despatch*\".153 The relatively detailed written submissions, accompanied by a reasonable volume of exhibits cited in support of the Respondent's \"*factual basis*\", which includes extensive legal authorities, containing a large number of contentious issues, present the Tribunal with an exercise that is neither simple nor uncomplicated. The Tribunal accepts that this in itself does not preclude it from accepting a Rule 41(5) objection. The problem is that, at the heart of jurisdiction in this case, is a difficult point of contention that involves, as the Respondent acknowledges, an issue that is \"*widely discussed in arbitration circles*\".154\n\n*Trans-Global v. Jordan* (**CL-0004**), para. 88.\n\nApplication, para. 188.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that the difficult point of contention is actually the *legal effect* of the 11 events asserted by the Respondent as its \"*factual basis*\". That is a matter that is not only \"*widely discussed*\", but also widely debated, in public international law circles, including beyond the EU in the context of the broader application of international investment protection.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent's \"*factual basis*\", as pleaded, focuses exclusively on EU instruments and decisions, including several judicial decisions of the CJEU. It excludes any decisions or doctrine arising out of the broader international investment law context. In its response to the Claimant's Observations to its \"*factual basis*\", the Respondent argues that, \"[w]*hether or not other tribunals have decided to have jurisdiction* [\u2026] *is irrelevant*\" and \"*[t]his Tribunal should not be impressed by other tribunals' legal analysis, especially if such legal analysis is erroneous*\".155\n\nReply Observations, para. 17.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent's position in that regard is not entirely consistent. In its Application, it cites to and relies upon several previous ICSID decisions regarding to the applicable standard under Rule 41(5), including *Trans-Global v. Jordan* and *Global Trading v. Ukraine*.\n\n107.\n\nAccordingly, insofar as the Respondent seeks to assert the effect of the 11 events listed at paragraph 26 above as forming its uncontested \"*factual basis*\" for the purpose if this Application, such matrix is neither complete nor broadly undisputed as between the Parties.\n\n***d. Manifestly Without Legal Merit***\n---------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nEven assuming the \"*factual basis*\" were sufficiently undisputed (including as to its effect), as pleaded, the Tribunal would also need to be persuaded that the legal arguments put forward by the Respondent establish that the claim is clearly and obviously or \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" as against those facts.\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent puts forward three separate legal grounds for its objection that the claim is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction: (i) based on the interpretation of the ECT; (ii) due to EU developments; and (iii) based on an arbitration agreement pursuant to private law. The Tribunal considers these grounds below.\n\n*(i) ECT interpretation*\n------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the interpretation of the ECT in accordance with the VCLT means there is no valid offer to arbitrate by the Respondent, because the ECT treats the EU and its Member States as a single entity and, therefore, the reference in Article 10 of the ECT to \"*other contracting parties*\" can only mean non-EU Member States.156 It further submits that, as the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT (specifically Article 31(1) of the VCLT),157 neither the ordinary meaning of the ECT's terms, nor its context, object and purpose, even when taking into account the preparatory works, can be a basis for this Tribunal's jurisdiction.158\n\nApplication, para. 97; ECT (**CL-0019**), Arts. 1(10), 10.\n\nApplication, para. 98.\n\nApplication, para. 100.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimants raise two legal arguments in response: (i) \"*EU law*\" is not applicable law pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT to determine the Tribunal's jurisdiction because it applies only to the merits of a dispute between the Parties and not to issues relating to the Tribunal's jurisdiction;159 and (ii) there are no rules between the parties of the ECT within the meaning of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT to deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction, as \"*Article 31(3)(c) VCLT requires practice that establishes rules 'between the parties' to the relevant treaty*\", and none of the instruments the Respondent invokes meets that requirement.160\n\nObservations, paras. 50-51.\n\nObservations, para. 56.\n\n112.\n\nOn the basis of the legal arguments raised by the Parties, and their submissions concerning those arguments, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent's interpretation of the ECT in accordance with the VCLT is a sufficiently \"*undisputed or genuinely indisputable rule*[] *of law*\",161 as required to decide that the claim in the current arbitration is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\".\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea* (**CL-0008**), para. 89.\n\n*(ii) EU law*\n-------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that based on the progressive developments of the EU Treaties and EU law, including (i) changes to EU law following the Lisbon Treaty leading to the inapplicability of Article 26 of the ECT; (ii) the *Komstroy* Judgment; and (iii) political developments since 2018, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.162\n\nApplication, Sec. II.\n\n114.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue that the ECT, including Article 26, has not been superseded by the EU Treaties pursuant to Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT because the EU Treaties do not post-date the ECT on the basis that the relevant provisions of the EU Treaties were already part of their predecessor treaty, the Treaty of Rome and the European Communities Treaty.163 The Claimants further argue that, even if the EU Treaties were considered to be later, the EU Treaties and the ECT cannot be considered part of the same \"*treaty regime*\" and do not relate \"*to the same subject matter*\" within the meaning of Article 30(1) of the VCLT,164 and, in any event, the *lex specialis* conflict rules in Article 16 of the ECT prevail.165\n\nObservations, para. 58.\n\nObservations, paras. 60-61.\n\nObservations, para. 62.\n\n115.\n\nOn the basis of the legal arguments raised by the Parties, and their submissions concerning those arguments, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent's interpretation of the effect of developments, including recent developments, under EU law is a sufficiently \"*undisputed or genuinely indisputable rule*[] *of law*\",166 as required to decide that the claim in the current arbitration is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\". This is particularly so given the recency of the *Komstroy* Judgment and *PL Holdings* Judgment.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea* (**CL-0008**), para. 89.\n\n*(iii) Private law*\n-------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that pursuant to Article 5 of the VCLT any relevant rules of an international organisation take precedence over any general rule of public international law.167 Therefore, the primacy rule applies to the EU Treaties at the international level and endows them with *lex specialis* status vis-\u00e0-vis other rules of conflict. It is irrelevant whether the conflicting treaty was concluded before or after the EU Treaties, and whether or not it contains its own conflict rules.168\n\nReply Observations, paras. 40-44.\n\nReply Observations, para. 46.\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent's \"*position cannot be grounded in Article 5 VCLT and none of the Respondent's authorities has made this point*\".169 They argue that Article 5 of the VCLT does establish \"*that international organisations, such as the EU, may have their own rules when it comes to determining issues such as amendment, modification and interpretation of the constituent instrument, such as the EU Treaties*\", but \"*does* *not* *have anything to say about the relationship between EU Treaties and other treaties, such as the ECT*\".170\n\nRejoinder Observations, para. 18.\n\nRejoinder Observations, paras. 19-20.\n\n118.\n\nOn the basis of the legal arguments raised by the Parties, and their submissions concerning those arguments, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent's interpretation of Article 5 of the VCLT is a sufficiently \"*undisputed or genuinely indisputable rule*[] *of law*\",171 as required to decide that the claim in the current arbitration is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\".\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea* (**CL-0008**), para. 89.\n\n119.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal recognises that from the Respondent's perspective, the legal basis is clear and obvious pursuant to EU law, based on a series of CJEU decisions and instruments. However, to date none of those decisions or instruments has been adopted and applied outside the EU courts or government. The two most recent CJEU decisions in the *Komstroy* Judgment and the *PL Holdings* Judgment in particular have not been subject to consideration, interpretation or application by a judicial or quasi-judicial body applying public international law outside the CJEU or EU Member State courts.\n\n120.\n\nAccordingly, that consideration, interpretation or application remains novel and, it would appear, potentially disputed. In that context, the Tribunal refers to the tribunal's finding in *PNG v. Papua New Guinea*, that Rule 41(5) \"*is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts*\".172\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal nevertheless emphasises that, as accepted by the Parties, the legal standard for Rule 41(5) is a high one. The Respondent's failure to meet that standard on these jurisdictional grounds says nothing about the relative strength of any substantive arguments on jurisdiction, which would be ventilated in full at an appropriate stage of the proceedings.\n\n***e. Nationality Objection***\n------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nFinally, the Respondent's alternative legal ground for lack of jurisdiction is based on Claimants Four, Five and Six \u2013 *i.e.*, Horizont I Development GmbH, Horizon II Renewable GmbH and Horizont III Power GmbH, respectively \u2013 being incorporated in Germany and not, therefore, protected investors.173 According to the Respondent, the Claimants do not provide evidence that would establish Claimants Four, Five and Six being \"*Irish companies via control*\" and are thus \"*not protected investors*\".174\n\nApplication, para. 2.\n\nReply Observations, paras. 55-56.\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimants contend in response that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants are \"*nationals of another Contracting State*\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention by virtue of Article 26(7) of the ECT since they were owned and controlled by the First, Second and Third Claimants respectively.175\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 66, fn. 32; Rejoinder Observations, paras. 28-29; Extract from Share Register of the Fourth Claimant, 15 April 2021 (**C-0008**); Extract from Share Register of the Fifth Claimant, 15 April 2021 (**C-0011**); Extract from Share Register of the Sixth Claimant, 15 April 2021 (**C-0013**).\n\n124.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides that a juridical person that has the nationality of the host State on the date of consent to arbitration can be a claimant if the parties have agreed to treat such juridical person as a national of another Contracting State because of foreign control. The Claimants indicate that such agreement can be found in Article 26(7) of the ECT, which provides:\n\n*An Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\"* [\u2026]*.*176\n\nECT (**CL-0019**), Art. 26(7).\n\n125.\n\nOn the basis of the Claimants' response, which submits that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants were owned and controlled by the (Irish) First, Second and Third Respondents at the date of consent and before the dispute between the Parties arose, as pleaded in the Request for Arbitration, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent's objection to nationality is sufficient grounds to decide that their claim is \"*manifestly without legal merit*\".\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n126.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal determines as follows:\n\na. the Respondent's Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) is denied;\n\nb. both Parties' requests that the Tribunal rule on jurisdiction are denied in the context of this Application; and\n\nc. any decision as to costs is reserved."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Respondent's Request for a Stay of the Proceeding)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Respondent's Request for a Stay of the Proceeding)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nPursuant to the agreed procedural calendar, on 25 March 2022, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Memorial**\"), together with supporting documentation.\n\n2.\n\nOn 6 May 2022, the Claimants filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction and Response to the Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Memorial**\"), together with supporting documentation. The Claimants\u2019 Memorial refers, *inter alia,* to a 28 April 2022 decision of the Higher Regional Court of Berlin regarding the Respondent\u2019s application under Sec. 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure to rule on the admissibility of the arbitral proceedings (the \"**Berlin Court Decision**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 23 May 2022, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal informing that it intends to appeal the Berlin Court Decision and requesting that the Tribunal stay this proceeding until the German Federal Court of Justice has decided on the Respondent\u2019s appeal (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Application for Stay**\").\n\n4.\n\nUpon invitation from the Tribunal, on 25 May 2022, the Claimants provided comments on the Application for Stay (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Response**\"), arguing that it be dismissed. The Claimants also requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to \"pay all legal fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants with regard to the request to stay this arbitration\".\n\n5.\n\nOn 30 May 2022, the Respondent objected to the Claimants\u2019 request for the Tribunal to make a decision on costs.\n\n6.\n\nAlso on 30 May 2022, the Claimants clarified that the Respondent had already filed its appeal against the Berlin Court Decision, on 20 May 2022, and copied the appeal document to the Tribunal.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A.** **T****he** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **A****pplication**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal take into account its recent appeal concerning the Berlin Court Decision rejecting the Respondent\u2019s application under Sec. 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure to rule on the admissibility of the arbitral proceedings. According to the Respondent, the Berlin Court had rejected the application on the grounds that the invalidity of an arbitration agreement in favour of ICSID arbitration could not be raised in proceedings pursuant to Sec. 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure..1\n\nRespondent's Application for Stay (\"**Application**\"), p. 1.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Court\u2019s reasoning is wrong and under appeal. It requests that *\"[c]onsidering that the Arbitral Tribunal is bound by EU law, that the arbitration agreement is invalid under EU law and that German courts have jurisdiction to examine the admissibility of the proceedings\",* the Tribunal stay the proceeding pending the outcome of the appeal..2\n\nApplication, p. 3.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that it *\"does not consider it necessary or appropriate for the Tribunal to make a decision on costs at this stage of the proceedings\u2019\"* because they are *\"still in their early stages\"..3*\n\nRespondent's letter of 30 May 2022.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **C****laimants****\u2019 R****esponse**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal should reject the Application for Stay as *\"untimely and unfounded,.4* as well as being *\"contrary to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention to determine its own competence\"..5*\n\nClaimants' Response (\"**Response**\"), para. 1.\n\nResponse, para. 3.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent makes \"*no attempt to outline the Tribunal's power to order a stay or the parameters within which that power should be exercised\"..6* They further accuse the Respondent of using the Application for Stay as a \"*funnel through which the Respondent has made its unsolicited submissions on the [Berlin Court Decision]\"..7*\n\nResponse, para. 4.\n\nResponse, para. 4.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants further seek legal fees in relation to the Application for Stay..8\n\nResponse, para. 13.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants subsequently clarified to the Tribunal that the date of the Respondent\u2019s appeal of the Berlin Court Decision was 20 May 2022. The Claimants provided the Tribunal with a German language copy of the appeal. The Tribunal has not received an English language translation.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent does not provide any basis for its Application for Stay pursuant to the ICSID Convention and/or the ICSID Rules. It simply makes the conclusory statement that:\n\n*Considering that the Arbitral Tribunal is bound by EU law, that the arbitration agreement is invalid under EU law and that German courts have jurisdiction to examine the admissibility of the proceedings, Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal*\n\n***Stays the arbitral proceedings until the German Federal Court of Justice has decided upon Respondent\u2019s appeal in the proceedings under Sec. 1032(2) German Code of Civil Procedure with the Berlin Court file number 12 SchH 6/21..9***\n\nApplication, p. 3.\n\n15.\n\nIn the absence of any articulated basis upon which the Tribunal may exercise its power to stay the proceedings as requested, the Tribunal is unable to take any further steps in respect of the Application for Stay. It is not clear if it is intended as an application for provisional measures pursuant to the ICSID Convention Article 47, or something else.\n\n16.\n\nAs there is no clear basis upon which the Tribunal is requested to act, it is difficult for it to consider the Application for Stay against any legal or procedural standard. The Tribunal observes that if ongoing ICSID proceedings were stayed every time a party commenced or appealed in related national court proceedings, the ICSID procedure would become unworkable. That cannot be what was intended by the drafters of and parties to the ICSID Convention. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention specifically addresses the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings, unless the State party to the dispute has required the exhaustion of local remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration. The Respondent has not indicated any such requirement in this case.\n\n17.\n\nThere is of course provision for stay of enforcement of an award in certain circumstances. As there is no award in these proceedings at this time, those provisions are not applicable.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Application for Stay is merely a \"*funnel*\" through which the Respondent might make a further submission out of time in relation to bifurcation. The Tribunal has dealt with the Application for Stay as a separate decision, accordingly.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to make a separate order for costs in respect of the Application for Stay. The submissions were minimal and the additional costs incurred should be limited. There is no compelling reason to make a separate order for costs in respect of this Application at this time.\n\n**IV.** **DECISION**\n--------------------\n\n20.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. to reject the Respondent\u2019s request for stay; and\n\nb. to reserve costs.\n\nDate: 1 June 2022"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2022-06-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Antol\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Antol\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nAbsent compelling reasons, no respondent State should be imposed to go through full-fledged proceedings and plead the merits of the case in circumstances where the jurisdictional mandate is contested and not ascertained yet by the tribunal.\n\n2.\n\nIn the instant case, I have found no such reasons not to bifurcate. Thus, I respectfully dissent with the analysis and the decision of the majority that rejects the request for bifurcation and joins the preliminary objections to the merits, contained in Procedural Order No. 3 (\"the Order\"). An analysis grounded in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, the case law on bifurcation, and the facts and circumstances of the case currently in the record, leads to this dissenting opinion.\n\n3.\n\nI hereby elaborate on the foregoing statements, starting with (i) some general considerations and the legal standard, followed by (ii) the application of that standard to the case at hand, to (iii) conclude that bifurcation should be ordered.\n\n**I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS & LEGAL STANDARD**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent has requested bifurcation on the basis of three preliminary objections contesting the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, namely: the *ratione voluntatis* objection (intra-EU arbitration); the *ratione materiae* objection (lack of investment); and the *ratione personae* objection (only for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Claimants).\n\n5.\n\nIn order to frame the analysis, it is important to bear in mind that there are different types of bifurcation. Indeed, any party may request that a question (preliminary or not - *e.g., quantum)* be addressed in a separate phase of the arbitration and tribunals have general discretionary powers to rule in that regard under the umbrella of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention.1\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 44: \"Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\n6.\n\nHowever, when that question is precisely a preliminary objection,2 specific provisions are dedicated by the ICSID Convention and by the ICSID Arbitration Rules to the issue, considering the special nature of this kind of objections. Article 41 of the ICSID Convention (under Section 3, \"Powers and Functions of the Tribunal\") provides that the Tribunal shall determine whether to deal with the preliminary objection as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits:\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.3\n\nDefined as \"[a]ny objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal\" by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1).\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 41.\n\n7.\n\nFurthermore, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 (under the heading of \"Preliminary Objections\") adds, in relevant parts, (i) that the objection shall be made as early as possible and no later than the counter-memorial submission, and (ii) that the Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage, whether the dispute before it is within its own competence:\n\n(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\n\n(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.4\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules, R. 41.\n\n8.\n\nFrom the reading of the above paragraphs of the applicable statutory rules, it is clear that preliminary objections are preferential in nature, and this characteristic requires their treatment as a preliminary question, as far as possible. This does not imply any presumption; there is no presumption of bifurcation or non-bifurcation. All relevant circumstances of the case must be considered in exercising this discretionary power of determining whether to bifurcate, always bearing in mind the overarching principles of procedural fairness and economy. And one of the relevant circumstances is this specific preferential nature of jurisdictional objections.\n\n9.\n\nMoreover, it can be noted that the 2022 Amendment of the ICSID Rules5 maintains this specificity. Indeed, these regulate bifurcation under Chapter VI (\"Special Procedures\") of the Arbitration Rules and keep the unique character of preliminary objections, distinguishing and dedicating different rules to \"bifurcation\" in general, \"preliminary objections\", and \"preliminary objections with a request for bifurcation\".6\n\nRules not applicable to the instant case. ICSID Member States approved the amended rules on 21 March 2022.\n\n2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules, R. 42, R. 43, and R. 44, respectively.\n\n10.\n\nThis distinction and preferential character of jurisdictional objections is naturally connected to a fundamental principle in international adjudication: the consensual basis of jurisdiction. As the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention reminds, \"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\".7\n\nReport of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, \u00b6 23.\n\n11.\n\nThe well-known case law related to bifurcation *(e.g., Glamis Gold v. USA, Emmis v. Hungary, Philip Morris v. Australia)8* is cited by the Parties and lists some relevant factors included in the Order, but: the list of factors is non-exhaustive; and the case law differs somewhat in the nuances regarding some factors-nuances that could have an impact. For the sake of avoiding reiterations, I will refer only to the points relevant to this case and in addressing the application to the present arbitration.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2, 31 May 2005, **RL-0064**; *Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Bifurcation, 13 June 2013, **RL-0065**; *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, 14 April 2014 (\"*Philip Morris v. Australia*\"), **RL-0069**.\n\n12.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the nature of jurisdictional objections, the tribunal in *Sumrain v. Kuwait* highlighted \"the particular sensitivities in exercising jurisdiction in circumstances where the jurisdictional mandate is challenged\",9 stating that:\n\n[T]here are by definition more compelling reasons for a tribunal to establish if it has adjudicative authority at all before it exercises that authority over the dispute in its entirety. There is no doubt that a tribunal has the power, on the basis of competence-competence, to adjudicate upon objections to its jurisdiction. The question is rather at what stage of the proceedings the tribunal should exercise this power of competence-competence. If a tribunal reserves its decision on jurisdiction until after a full examination of the merits of the case, then the tribunal will be acting throughout the proceedings on the assumption that it does have jurisdiction\u2014every step that the tribunal takes in the arbitration presupposes that is properly vested with adjudicative authority over the parties and their dispute on the basis of a valid reference to arbitration. The same issue does not arise in respect of questions relating to admissibility, liability or quantum.10\n\n*Ayat Nizar Raja Sumrain and others v. State of Kuwait*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/20, Procedural Order No. 2, 1 February 2021 (available at: http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C7953/DS15813\\_En.pdf), \u00b6 45.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 15 [emphasis original].\n\n13.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of compelling reasons, no party should be required to argue the merits of the case in circumstances where the jurisdictional mandate is contested and has not yet been determined by the tribunal that has to exercise it. As distinguished scholars comment: \"It does not make sense to go through lengthy and costly proceedings dealing with the merits of the case unless the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction has been determined authoritatively\".11\n\nC. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2009) (excerpt) (\"Schreuer\"), **RL-0075**, p. 537.\n\n**II. APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD TO THE INSTANT CASE**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nFirst of all, since all relevant circumstances must be considered, it is worth recapping the following background of this case: (i) the Respondent has put forward three preliminary objections; (ii) these objections contest the jurisdiction of this Tribunal from three different angles; (iii) the formal requirements have been met in a timely manner; (iv) there is currently a Procedural Timetable in place contained in Procedural Order No. 1 considering the scenario of bifurcating; (v) according to that Timetable, no counter-memorial on the merits has been submitted yet by the Respondent; (vi) two memorials on jurisdiction have already been filed, one by the Respondent and the other by the Claimants; and (vii) in case of bifurcating, the total time dedicated by the Parties to the remaining submissions on jurisdiction would be, approximately, four months from the date.12\n\nScenario 3 of Procedural Order No. 1's Procedural Timetable provides for a two-day Hearing on Jurisdiction on 4 and 5 October 2022.\n\n15.\n\nThe above background is relevant to assess the preferential character of the objections (points (i) and (ii)), the conduct of the applicant (point (iii)), and time and cost considerations (points (iii) to (vii)). These are the current facts, and, for rigorous analysis, I do not find it helpful to speculate on hypothetical circumstances.\n\n16.\n\nSecond, addressing other factors contemplated, I agree with the Order in that it does not consider any of the jurisdictional objections to be frivolous. Further, I also agree with the analysis of the potential effect of bifurcation on dismissing or materially reducing the proceedings. It is clear that these two factors weigh in favour of the bifurcation of the arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nHowever, I disagree with the Order over the considerations with regard to the factor related to potential intertwining issues between jurisdiction and the merits (first and second objections). On this subject, the quotation *ut supra* continues: \"On the other hand, some jurisdictional questions are *so intimately linked* to the merits of the case that it is *impossible* to dispose of them in preliminary form\".13 Therefore, the legal test is not whether or not the preliminary issue is intertwined with the merits. Rather, the crux of the matter is whether it is \"so intertwined that\" bifurcation is *impossible (e.g.,* because it would imply prejudging the merits), and I find no reason why that should be the case here, not for the first objection nor for the second one. Naturally, that impracticability would have to be grounded on certain and verified elements and not on conjecture.\n\nSchreuer, **RL-0075**, p. 537 [emphasis added].\n\n18.\n\nRegarding the first objection *(ratione voluntatis),* the Respondent submits that \"Respondent\u2019s primary jurisdictional objection is a matter of principle and the correct understanding of EU law in an intra-EU dispute. Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection only raises matters of treaty interpretation. It is not intimately linked to the merits that deal with an alleged violation of Art. 10 ECT. [...] The arguments at the jurisdictional phase focus on the fact whether or not the ECT is applicable in an intra-EU relationship. This discussion can be had and decided totally independently [...]\".14 The Claimants, on the other hand, state that it \"is so intertwined with the merits that it would not be efficient or fair to bifurcate\"15 and, to support this statement, argue that it \"would be better resolved at the merits stage\",16 quote decisions stating that \"it would benefit from a better understanding of the provisions at issue under the ECT [...] and their relation to EU Law\",17 that \"the general relationship [...] is presently analysed and reviewed in different *fora*\",18 and refer to prior practice of other tribunals in other cases. However, any bifurcation request must be examined \"in light of its own specific factual and legal circumstances\".19 Moreover, no specific reason has been articulated to justify that the discussion could not be bifurcated. Thus, no current material impediment to address this jurisdictional objection has been identified.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation (\"Resp. Mem.\"), \u00b6 266.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on Jurisdiction and Response to the Request for Bifurcation (\"Cl. Mem.\"), heading of Sec. V.D.1.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 179.\n\n*Ibid.* (citing *Canepa Green Energy Opportunities I, S.\u00e1.r.l. and Canepa Green Energy Opportunities II, S.\u00e1.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/4, Procedural Order No. 3, 28 August 2020, **CL-0197**, \u00b6 94).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 180 (citing *LSG Building Solutions GmbH and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/19, Procedural Order No. 3, 9 October 2019, **CL-0198**, \u00b6 38).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 148 (citing *Philip Morris v. Australia*, **RL-0069**, \u00b6 103).\n\n19.\n\nAs to the second objection *(ratione materiae,* investment), the Respondent submits that this objection can be decided on the basis of the Claimants\u2019 arguments submitted in their Memorial on Jurisdiction alone, that it concerns questions which can be decided before the merits stage, and that it only requires a very basic examination of the facts already presented and a taking of evidence is not necessary.20 The Claimants, again, state that it \"is so intertwined with the merits that it would not be efficient or fair to bifurcate\".21 The Claimants argue that examination of experts and witnesses would be needed, and that the Respondent has made references to some paragraphs of the Claimants\u2019 expert reports and witness statements.22 Nonetheless, even under the assumption that hypothetical efficiency could prevail over the preferential character of jurisdictional objections - *quod non,* on the basis of the record as it currently stands, the Claimants\u2019 statements are not persuasive in this regard. The very few referred paragraphs seem to be mentioned just as support (not to rebate them) by the referring Party and, without entering into undue speculation, the fact is that, having both the Respondent and the Claimants already submitted the first round of pleadings on jurisdiction: (i) the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction *is not* accompanied by any expert reports or witness statements; and (ii) the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Jurisdiction *is not* accompanied either by any additional expert reports or witness statements.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 268.\n\nCl. Mem., heading of Sec. V.D.2.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 182-184.\n\n20.\n\nFinally, with regards to the third objection *(ratione personae),* obviously, being partial, it would not dispose of the case for the rest of the Claimants. Nevertheless, considering it in conjunction with the previous two objections that ought to be bifurcated, this third objection should be bifurcated as well.\n\n**III. CONCLUSION**\n-------------------\n\n21.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent with the majority and, as a matter of principle, I do not add my vote to those of my colleagues. I opine that the jurisdictional objections should not be joined to the merits and that the proceedings should be bifurcated. All the above is in the pursuit of procedural fairness and economy, and according to the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules in place.\n\nDate: 7 June 2022"}], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns claims brought by (i) Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd, (ii) International Mainstream Renewable Power Limited, and (iii) Mainstream Renewable Power Group Finance Ltd, three private companies limited by shares incorporated in Ireland, and (iv) Horizont I Development GmbH, (v) Horizont II Renewable GmbH, and (vi) Horizont III Power GmbH, three limited liability companies incorporated in Germany (together, the \"**Claimants**\"), against the Federal Republic of Germany (\"**Germany**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The dispute was submitted by the Claimants to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\"). The proceedings are administered under the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"). The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\".\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute arises out of measures taken by the Respondent regarding its regulatory regime for wind energy, which allegedly affected the Claimants' wind energy projects, resulting in a loss to their investments.\n\n3.\n\nThis Procedural Order concerns the Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation dated 25 March 2022 (the \"**Request**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 12 October 2021, the Respondent filed an Application Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), arguing that the Claimants' claim is manifestly without legal merit and should be dismissed (the \"**Rule 41(5) Application**\"). Following the establishment of a briefing schedule, the Parties subsequently made submissions on the Rule 41(5) Application.\n\n5.\n\nThe first session was held on 26 October 2021. On 22 November 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") recording the agreement of the Parties and the Tribunal's determinations on procedural matters. PO1 was subsequently amended on 26 January 2022. Annex C to PO1 set forth the procedural calendar if the Tribunal dismissed the Rule 41(5) Application, with a scenario involving a request for bifurcation of the proceeding.\n\n6.\n\nOn 18 January 2022, the Tribunal decided on the Rule 41(5) Application (the \"**Rule 41(5) Decision**\"), wherein it concluded:\n\n*In view of the above, the Tribunal determines as follows:*\n\n*a. the Respondent's Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) is denied;*\n\n*b. both Parties' requests that the Tribunal rule on jurisdiction are denied in the context of this Application; and*\n\n*c. any decision as to costs is reserved.*1\n\nRule 41(5) Decision, para. 126.\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to the procedural calendar, on 25 March 2022, the Respondent filed the Request, together with Legal Authorities RL-0014 through RL-0076.\n\n8.\n\nOn 6 May 2022, the Claimants filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and Response to the Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Response**\"), together with Exhibits C-0164 through C-0177 and Legal Authorities CL-0137 through CL-0213.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 May 2022, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal take into account its recent appeal concerning the decision of the Higher Regional Court of Berlin (the *Kammergericht*, or \"**Berlin Court**\") dated 28 April 2022, which had rejected the Respondent's application under Sec. 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure to rule on the admissibility of the arbitral proceedings(\"**Berlin Court Application**\"). The Berlin Court rejected the application on the grounds that the invalidity of an arbitration agreement in favour of ICSID arbitration could not be raised in proceedings pursuant to Sec. 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (*Zivilprozessordnung*).\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the Court's reasoning was wrong and under appeal. It requested that \"[*c*]*onsidering that the Arbitral Tribunal is bound by EU law, that the arbitration agreement is invalid under EU law and that German courts have jurisdiction to examine the admissibility of the proceedings*\", the Tribunal stay the proceeding pending the outcome of the appeal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 25 May 2022, the Claimants submitted in response that the Tribunal should reject the application to stay as \"*untimely and unfounded*\", as well as being \"*contrary to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention to determine its own competence*\", and sought legal fees.\n\n12.\n\nOn 30 May 2022, the Respondent wrote further to notify the Tribunal that it \"*does not consider it necessary or appropriate for the Tribunal to make a decision on costs at this stage of the proceedings*\" because they are \"*still in their early stages*\". The Respondent however upholds its request for stay pending the outcome of the appeal in the Berlin Court Application. Also on 30 May 2022, the Claimants clarified the date of the appeal in the Berlin Court Application, being 20 May 2022, and copied the appeal document to the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, in Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's Application to Stay the arbitration pending the outcome of the appeal in the Berlin Court Application.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThis section provides a brief summary of the Parties' positions on the bifurcation of objections to jurisdiction, including their respective views on the applicable legal standard and on how that standard should be applied to the facts of this case.\n\n**A. T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **R****equest**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent raises three separate jurisdictional objections: (i) lack of consent to arbitrate pursuant to ECT Article 26 and ICSID Convention Article 25(1) (the \"***intra-EU objection***\"); (ii) lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the Claimants' activity not constituting an investment; and (iii) no personal jurisdiction in respect of the three German Claimants.\n\n16.\n\nThe basis for the Respondent's application to bifurcate is set out at paragraphs 249 to 288 of its Request. It argues that the applicable criteria for ICSID Convention Articles 41(1) and (2) are met. In particular, it submits that: (i) the jurisdictional objections are substantial;2 (ii) if bifurcation were granted it would result in material reduction in the proceeding;3 (iii) the preliminary issue is not intertwined with the merits;4 and (iv) bifurcation would promote procedural efficiency and fairness.5\n\nRequest, paras. 256-262.\n\nRequest, paras. 263-264.\n\nRequest, paras. 265-268.\n\nRequest, paras. 269-282.\n\n17.\n\nAs to the substantial nature of its objections, the Respondent submits that bifurcation should be denied if the objections are frivolous,6 and here the objections \"*cannot be dismissed as frivolous, but must be qualified as substantial and serious*\".7\n\nRequest, para. 257.\n\nRequest, para. 262.\n\n18.\n\nAs to the material reduction of the proceeding, the Respondent submits that if bifurcation were permitted then \"[*a*]*n in depth analysis of the merits will not be necessary, but the Tribunal is invited to focus its efforts on the jurisdictional questions*\".8 The Respondent further submits that its \"*intra-EU objection*\" would be dispositive.9\n\nRequest, para. 263.\n\nRequest, para. 264.\n\n19.\n\nAs to the preliminary issue not being intertwined with the merits, in relation to the \"*intra-EU objection*\", the Respondent submits that \"*there is no close relationship between Respondent's primary jurisdictional objection* ratione voluntatis *and the merits of the case*\".10 It submits that the \"*arguments at the jurisdictional phase focus on the fact whether or not the ECT is applicable in an intra-EU relationship*\", which \"*can be had and decided totally independently of what Claimants wrongly allege as violation of the ECT in the matter*\".11 In relation to the subject matter jurisdiction, the Respondent submits that this can be \"*decided on the basis of Claimants' arguments submitted in their Memorial alone*\", on the grounds that \"*since the activities never left the preparatory stages and there was nothing that would or could have contributed to the economic development of the Federal Republic of Germany in any way*\".12\n\nRequest, para 266.\n\nRequest, para. 266.\n\nRequest, para. 268.\n\n20.\n\nAs to procedural efficiency, the Respondent refers the Tribunal to *Apotex v. USA* to support its position that the Tribunal should consider the circumstances of the case including as to risks of delay, wasted expense and prejudice.13\n\nRequest, para. 269, citing to *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v.

It submits that the Parties are \"*in agreement that the Tribunal has the power to bifurcate*\",23 and that whether it should exercise that power \"*is a practical question*\" and the main considerations are \"*procedural economy, efficiency and fairness*\".24\n\nResponse, para. 146.\n\nResponse, para. 147.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the three criteria asserted by the Respondent (*i.e.*, the criteria of (i) serious and substantial objection, (ii) which is dispositive of the case, and (iii) not intertwined with the merits) \"*represent non-exhaustive examples of procedural efficiency and hark back to a past trend in favour of a presumption of bifurcation which no longer exists*\".25 Instead, the Claimants submit that \"*any bifurcation request must be examined 'in light of its own specific factual and legal circumstances'*\".26 According to the Claimants, in the current case \"*viewed in the whole, bifurcation would not limit the duration and cost of proceedings in a procedurally efficient manner*\".27\n\nResponse, para. 148.\n\nResponse, para. 148, citing to *Philip Morris Asia Limited v.

Greenwood, \"Revisiting Bifurcation and Efficiency in International Arbitration Proceedings\", in 36 *Journal of International Arbitration* No. 4 (2019), **CL-0189**, p. 425.\n\nResponse, para. 155(ii).\n\nResponse, para. 151.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that even if bifurcation were to save time, it is still necessary to weigh the benefits of procedural fairness and efficiency against the risks of delay, wasted expense and prejudice for both sides.31\n\nResponse, para. 158, citing to *Apotex v. USA*, **RL-0073**, para 10.\n\n30.\n\nAs to the substantial nature of the objections, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections are not \"*serious and substantial*\".32\n\nResponse, paras. 165-172.\n\n31.\n\nAs to the dispositive nature of the objections, the Claimants point out that the Respondent's objections *ratione personae* would not dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised.33\n\nResponse, paras. 173-175.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, as to the intertwining of the jurisdictional objections and the merits, the Claimants submit that there are \"*closely linked*\" facts sufficient to justify a refusal to bifurcate.34 In particular the Claimants submit that the \"*intra-EU objection*\" is intertwined with the merits and has been found similarly to have been so other proceedings.35\n\nResponse, paras. 176-188.\n\nResponse, paras. 179-181, citing to *Canepa Green Energy Opportunities I, S.\u00e1.r.l. and Canepa Green Energy Opportunities II, S.\u00e1.r.l. v.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties' respective written submissions. At this stage it has focused on the Request for Bifurcation applicable standard and the application of that standard in the circumstances of the current case, as opposed to the substance of the objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**A. T****he** **A****pplicable** **S****tandard**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal is governed by Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n*Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal is further governed by Arbitration Rule 41, which provides in relevant parts:\n\n*(3) Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objection.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall decide whether or not the further procedures relating to the objection made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be oral. It may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.*\n\n37.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal has the power to bifurcate the Respondent's three jurisdictional objections pursuant to the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 41(1) ICSID Convention. However, the Parties differ as to whether or not and in what circumstances the Tribunal ought to exercise its power.\n\n38.\n\nThe ICSID Convention Article 41(2) relates exclusively to \"*[a]ny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal*\", i.e., a jurisdictional objection. Article 41(2) does not create a presumption that a tribunal must deal with such objection by way of \"*preliminary issue*\". Instead, and as both sides appear to accept, Article 41(2) leaves it to tribunal discretion to determine \"*whether to deal with [the objection] as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute*\".\n\n39.\n\nAs stated by Schreuer,39\n\n*The choice between a preliminary decision and a joinder to the merits is a matter of procedural economy. It does not make sense to go through lengthy and costly proceedings dealing with the merits of the case unless the tribunal's jurisdiction has been determined authoritatively. On the other hand, some jurisdictional questions are so intimately linked to the merits of the case that it is impossible to dispose of them in preliminary form.*\n\nSchreuer, **RL-0075**, p. 537.\n\n40.\n\nAs further noted by Schreuer, the proposal in the Working Paper and Preliminary Draft to the ICSID Convention that tribunals were mandated to decide jurisdictional objections as preliminary questions was expressly rejected in the final draft.40 The key factor is procedural economy in the particular case and that remains a matter for the Tribunal to determine solely in its discretion without any presumption in favour of a preliminary decision. Therefore, it is not for the Claimants to prove compelling reasons to rebut a presumption of bifurcation.\n\nSchreuer, **RL-0075**, p. 537.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's reliance on commentary that \"*ICSID tribunals have routinely suspended proceedings on the merits upon receipt of an objection to jurisdiction*\".41 This relates solely to the period of time between the raising of an objection to jurisdiction to the Tribunal decision on bifurcation. Moreover, the commentary reflects the position prior to the change to Rule 41(3) in April 2006. Prior to that time, Rule 41(3) required mandatory suspension of proceedings. Since April 2006, Rule 41(3) has left the matter of suspension also entirely to the Tribunal's discretion, as remained the case for bifurcation.\n\nRequest, para. 284, fn. 151, citing to Schreuer, **RL-0075**, p. 534.\n\n42.\n\nIf the practice of other tribunals were a factor in the Tribunal's consideration, the majority of the Tribunal notes the Claimants' observation that almost every one of the 42 tribunals that has considered the \"*intra-EU objection*\" has decided in its discretion not to bifurcate the objection to jurisdiction and not to suspend the merits pending resolution of the jurisdictional objection. Almost every one has in its discretion determined instead to join the preliminary question regarding the \"*intra-EU objection*\" to the merits.\n\n43.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal in the current arbitration is persuaded primarily by its consideration of the relevant factors before it in this particular case. Insofar as it were to be guided by decisions of prior tribunals, it would make most sense to be guided by those dealing with the same or substantially similar objection as in the current case.\n\n44.\n\nAs to the relevant factors that the majority of the Tribunal considers to be pertinent in this case, the Parties have broadly agreed that these include:\n\na. the nature of the jurisdictional objections;\n\nb. whether or not bifurcation would result in dismissal or a material reduction of the questions to be addressed in the proceedings;\n\nc. whether or not the preliminary issue is intertwined with the merits;\n\nd. whether or not bifurcation would promote procedural, time and cost efficiency; and\n\ne. general principles of fairness to both sides.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that the Claimants consider the factors identified by the Respondent based on the *Glamis Gold v. USA* case to be non-exhaustive examples of procedural efficiency that pre-date the amendment to the Rules.42 However, the Tribunal considers that the factors outlined in paragraph 44 above, which include but are not limited to the *Glamis Gold* factors, are appropriate for it to consider in exercising its discretion.\n\n*See* Response, paras. 147-148, referring to Request, para. 252, fn. 143 (citing to, *inter alia,* *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2, 31 May 2005, **RL-0064**, para. 12).\n\n46.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal further notes that it does not accept the additional standard proposed by the Claimants that \"*[i]f the Tribunal considers that* *any* *of the Respondent's objections do not merit bifurcation, procedural efficiency dictates that* *all* *of the objections should be so joined*\".43 Rather, the majority of the Tribunal considers it appropriate to consider the case and the jurisdictional objections in the whole and determine whether or not they collectively render it appropriate to bifurcate. That approach would be most consistent with the objective of achieving procedural economy.\n\nResponse, para. 150 [emphasis original].\n\n**B. T****he** **A****pplication of the****S****tandard**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nFirst, as to the nature of the objections, it is appropriate at this stage in the proceeding for the Tribunal to take a *prima facie* view as to whether or not these are frivolous. The Tribunal has not taken a decision on the substantive arguments, legal basis or evidence regarding the jurisdictional objections, and nor will it be in a position to do so fairly and reasonably, until each side has had a full opportunity to present its case. The purpose of this decision is simply to consider whether or not those objections are frivolous.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the frivolous threshold, based on the plain meaning of the term, to be one that would require the objections to have little or no weight or not deserve any serious attention. This is a relatively low threshold. It does not mean that the objections are likely to prevail or even are necessarily compelling. It simply means that on their face they appear to warrant serious attention and consideration by the Tribunal. No further weighing of the merits of those decisions can or will be made until they are considered having given both sides a full opportunity to be heard in a procedurally economic manner.\n\n49.\n\nHaving considered the scope and nature of the three jurisdictional objections and the bases as set out in the Respondent's Request, the Tribunal does not consider any one of these to be frivolous on the basis set out above.\n\n50.\n\nAs to the effect of this *prima facie* finding, the Respondent suggests that having determined the objections not to be frivolous, the Tribunal should automatically proceed to bifurcate the proceedings to deal with them as a preliminary issue. The Tribunal does not agree that this is the natural conclusion as procedural economy requires a weighing up of all of the relevant factors. Therefore, it proceeds instead to consider each of the remaining four.\n\n51.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal has considered each side's position as to the effect of bifurcation on dismissing or materially reducing the proceeding. In this respect, the Tribunal assumes that the jurisdictional objectives were to succeed (broader procedural economy taking into account bifurcation and failure of the jurisdictional objections is dealt with separately below). It is plain that if the Respondent were to succeed in respect of its first or second jurisdictional objection, that would result in a termination of the proceeding. If, on the other hand, it were only to succeed in its third objection as to the personal jurisdiction in respect of the three German Claimants, the proceeding would not be materially reduced, and the Respondent has not suggested otherwise.\n\n52.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is persuaded that the early consideration of the first and second jurisdictional objections, but not the third, could result in early termination of the proceeding.\n\n53.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal has considered the extent to which the factors and arguments regarding the jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits. This is the factor that Schreuer describes as \"*jurisdictional questions [] so intimately linked to the merits of the case that it is impossible to dispose of them in preliminary form*\".44 In this regard, the majority of the Tribunal is less troubled by the third jurisdictional objection dealing with the three German Claimants. It is concerned however that the first and/or second objections are likely linked to the merits of the case. Whilst it may not be 'impossible' to dispose of these objections separately, there is a risk that doing so may lead to a decision that prejudges factual and/or legal issues that require proper consideration of the evidence and arguments on the merits as well as the arguments on the jurisdictional objections.\n\nSchreuer, **RL-0075**, p. 537.\n\n54.\n\nTherefore, given potential intertwining of issues (as described below) it is impossible for the majority of the Tribunal at this juncture to determine that it is able to dispose of the first and second jurisdictional objections without risking injustice to one or more of the Parties.\n\n55.\n\nAs to the first objection, the Respondent invokes the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\") cases of *Achmea*, *Komstroy* and *European Food* in support. It cites to *Komstroy* in that \"*an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article 26(6) ECT is required to interpret, and even apply, EU law*\".45 That reference follows from the CJEU's discussion at paragraph 48 of the judgment that \"*in the first place, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article 26(6) ECT, the arbitral tribunal provided for in paragraph 4 of that article is to rule on the issues in dispute in accordance with the ECT and with the applicable rules and principles of international law*\".46\n\nRequest, para. 46, citing to *Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy LLC*, CJEU Case C-741/19, Judgment, 2 September 2021 (\"***Komstroy***\"), **RL-0007**, para. 50.\n\n*Komstroy*, para. 48.\n\n56.\n\nThe reference does not expressly limit any requirement to interpret and apply EU law to the question of jurisdiction independent of any underlying interpretation or application of EU law to the merits of the dispute. The three primary CJEU decisions relied upon by the Respondent as forming the basis of its \"*intra-EU objection*\" each involved an underlying arbitration in which the Respondent EU Member State argued that the investment protection and relief sought would constitute State aid in breach of EU law. The underlying tribunals' role in interpreting or applying that EU law was a predicate to the CJEU decisions.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent currently describes its \"*intra-EU objection*\" as being based on the argument that arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs in themselves give rise to a ***risk*** that a tribunal established pursuant to such arbitration clause ***may*** have to apply EU law, sufficient to exclude the Tribunal's jurisdiction.47 However, in each of the CJEU decisions that it relies on as central to its \"*intra-EU objection*\", the respondent EU Member State had raised EU State aid law in the context of the underlying merits case. Therefore, although the Respondent does not currently put its \"*intra-EU objection*\" on the basis that this Tribunal needs to apply EU law to the merits of this dispute, the CJEU decisions each appears to have included that additional element. These cases therefore did not involve a factual matrix of hypothetical risk of a tribunal possibly needing to apply EU law but, on the respondent EU Member State's case, the relevant tribunal in fact being required to interpret or apply EU law.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 43-47.\n\n58.\n\nIn the current case, the Respondent has not yet pleaded its defence on the merits. It is not yet clear whether or not it intends to argue the application of EU law to the merits, as well as to jurisdiction. Assuming that, in line with the authorities that the Respondent has invoked in support of its \"*intra-EU objection*\", the Respondent were to raise the issue to the application of EU law to the merits, then the jurisdictional questions would be very much intertwined with the merits in this proceeding. In the circumstances, the application of EU law in relation to jurisdiction may not be as discrete as the Respondent has suggested.\n\n59.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is concerned that this raises a risk that it will not be able to deal with the Respondent's arguments as to the application of EU law in a fair or full manner that properly affords a full right to be heard by both sides.\n\n60.\n\nAs to the second objection, the Claimants have set out in some detail the extent to which the nature of the activity is intertwined with the facts and expert and factual evidence. They note in particular that the Respondent has sought to rely upon that evidence and expert testimony, which goes to the Claimants' case on the merits, in support of the second jurisdictional objection.48 This indicates that this jurisdictional objection raises issues that are in fact intertwined, not simply theoretically, with the facts and expert issues regarding the merits.\n\nResponse, paras. 182-184, citing to Request, paras. 170, 182, 188-191, 198, 232, 237.\n\n61.\n\nWhilst the Respondent has indicated that \"*the question whether or not Claimants have made an investment can be decided on the basis of the Claimants' arguments submitted in their Memorial alone*\" and that \"*[a] taking of evidence is not necessary*\", they nevertheless repeatedly rely on evidence as indicated above. The Respondent's interpretation and reliance on this evidence may well give rise to additional evidential questions for the Claimants and indeed the Tribunal. Therefore, based on the manner in which the Respondent has pleaded its case on subject matter jurisdiction, it has raised and relied on matters of evidence that are intertwined with the merits.\n\n62.\n\nFourthly, as to procedural, time and cost efficiency, the Tribunal has considered each of the factors raised by the Claimants and the Respondent. It is mindful that it must weigh these factors as they affect both sides and not only the party requesting bifurcation. Moreover, it must consider procedural economy also in the event that a preliminary question were unsuccessful.\n\n63.\n\nIn the event of bifurcation, if either the first or second jurisdictional objection were successful, this case would be concluded by the end of 2022 or early 2023. In that scenario, the Parties would have saved the time and cost of proceeding with the arbitration for an additional nine or so months, conceivably to reach the same result at the conclusion of a single hearing on both jurisdiction and merits.\n\n64.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is not able to predetermine that outcome. It is just as possible that in the event of bifurcation the first or second jurisdictional objections would not succeed and the case would need to proceed to a second stage on merits. In that case, not only will there be a second hearing and decision phase, but there is likely to be duplicative fact and expert evidence and cross-examination, at least in relation to the third objection. This would create unnecessary additional cost and time, both to the hearing schedule but also to the Parties' respective preparation time.\n\n65.\n\nThe question of time and cost is in the balance in this case because the hearing schedule does raise the possibility of a merits hearing just four months later than the currently scheduled full hearing on jurisdiction and merits in September 2023. However, that scheduling assumes that the Tribunal members and the Parties will be able to find a convenient date in the first few months of 2024 and that there is no further slippage in the timetable. It is optimistic to assume that the delay would be limited to four months.\n\n66.\n\nAny delay increases the costs to the Parties and this is compounded by additional steps in the proceeding, additional hearings and duplication of witness and expert testimony. The Tribunal is keen to avoid unnecessary delay and cost where possible in the interests of procedural economy.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the pleadings to date have been relatively succinct and to the point. Fact and expert evidence is largely focused and relatively narrow. This approach has factored in the majority of the Tribunal's consideration as to time and cost. The case that the Respondent would be required to answer in a non-bifurcated proceeding is not one that is obviously overly or unnecessarily burdensome.\n\n68.\n\nFinally, as to overall fairness to the Parties, the majority of the Tribunal has some concerns about bifurcating the three jurisdictional objections identified in this particular case. As indicated above, although it is also concerned about possible intertwining issues in respect of the \"*intra-EU objection*\", the majority of the Tribunal is persuaded that there are almost certainly intertwining issues in respect of the second objection. These alone would suffice, in the Tribunal majority's view, to render this case appropriate to be heard in a single proceeding dealing with jurisdiction and merits.\n\n69.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is particularly concerned that it will not be in a position properly to hear and consider any intertwining issues in their entirety at a preliminary stage.\n\n70.\n\nThese risks, even if minimal, can be prevented in their entirety by not bifurcating the proceeding.\n\n71.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent's recent correspondence of 23 May 2022 seeking a stay of the arbitration pending the outcome of its recently filed appeal in the Berlin Court Application further reinforces the majority of the Tribunal's view against bifurcation. Whilst acknowledging the Claimants' position that the Berlin Court does not determine this Tribunal's jurisdiction as it is a matter for the competence of this Tribunal pursuant to the ICSID Convention and Rules, the existence of the appeal has been raised in the context of the jurisdiction objections. In support of its stay application, the Respondent has asserted that the appeal in the Berlin Court Application is relevant. As the appeal was filed on 20 May 2022, it is unlikely that a decision will be available prior to the due date for final submissions on jurisdiction in the event of bifurcation (i.e., June/July 2022). Whilst not determinative, this is an additional factor in the Tribunal majority's decision in this particular proceeding.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that its decision not to bifurcate the jurisdictional objections may give rise to additional cost but, as noted by the Respondent, this may be addressed in a cost order at the conclusion of the proceeding.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n73.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal, by majority, decides to:\n\na. reject the Respondent's request for bifurcation;\n\nb. join the \"*intra-EU objection*\", lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction objections to the merits; and\n\nc. direct the Parties to follow the Procedural Timetable set out in Scenario 2 of Annex C to PO1.\n\nDate: 7 June 2022"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Decision on the EC\u2019s Application to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2023-02-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Decision on the EC\u2019s Application to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 October 2022, the European Commission (the \"**EC**\") submitted to the ICSID Secretariat an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in this arbitration pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"**Application**\"). ICSID transmitted the Application to the Tribunal and the Parties on 6 October 2022.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), on 11 October 2022, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations on the Application. The Claimants and the Respondent submitted their observations on the Application (the \"**Claimants' Observations**\" and the \"**Respondent's Observations**\", respectively) on 25 October 2022.\n\n3.\n\nThis Procedural Order decides on the EC's Application.\n\n**II. THE APPLICATION AND THE PARTIES' OBSERVATIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe EC seeks leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in these proceedings as the \"*guardian of the European Union ('**EU**' or '**Union**') Treaties, i.e. the Treaty on European Union ('**TEU**'), the Treaty on [the] Functioning of European Union ('**TFEU**'), and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community*\", which the EC states put it \"*in charge of ensuring the uniform interpretation and proper application of the rules relating to investment protection within the Union. Hence, it has a particular interest in avoiding any conflict between ICSID arbitration awards and Union law*\".1\n\nEC Application, para. 2.\n\n5.\n\nThe EC confirms that it has \"*decided to request leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in any pending or future investment arbitration proceeding concerning disputes between an investor of one Member State and another Member State*\".2\n\nEC Application, para. 3.\n\n6.\n\nAs to the legal basis for its Application, the EC relies on Rule 37(2) of the ICSID\u00a0Arbitration Rules. The EC submits that \"[t]*he proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal raise important questions concerning the interaction of the EU Treaties, the Energy Charter Treaty, and the ICSID Convention*\".3 As to the EC's intervention on those questions, the EC submits that the requirements of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2)\u00a0would be met because: (i) its intervention would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties; (ii) it would address a matter within the scope of the dispute; and (iii) the EC has a significant interest in the proceeding.\n\nEC Application, para. 7.\n\n7.\n\nAs to the first of those requirements, the EC submits that these proceedings \"*raise important questions concerning the interaction of the EU Treaties, the Energy Charter Treaty, and the ICSID Convention*\".4 In particular:\n\na. the EC has a \"*special role for ensuring compliance of EU Member States, such as the Federal Republic of Germany, with Union law*\", which \"*follows from Article 17 TEU*\";5\n\nb. the EC \"*was the driving force behind the proposal for and negotiation of the* [ECT]\" and \"*has particular knowledge and insight on techniques used, in particular on the use of the Regional Economic Integration Organisation Clause and the necessity (or lack thereof) of so-called disconnection clauses*\";6 and\n\nc. although the Respondent is an EU Member State, \"*the EU and the EU Member States are independent persons in public international law (even if they often act as a single entity of public international law)*\", and therefore the EC \"*will provide independent knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties*\".7\n\nEC Application, para. 7.\n\nEC Application, paras. 8-12.\n\nEC Application, paras. 13-14.\n\nEC Application, paras. 15-16.\n\n8.\n\nAs to the second requirement, the EC acknowledges that it \"*has no knowledge of the request for arbitration and the counter-memorial on the merits filed by the Federal Republic of Germany on 26 August 2022*\", but nevertheless assumes that the Respondent had objected to jurisdiction \"*based on the declaration of EU Member States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in* Achmea [*\u2026*] *because the dispute is an intra-EU dispute*\", which it and the host State of at least some of the Claimants (*i.e.*, the Republic of Ireland) had signed.8\n\nEC Application, paras. 18-19.\n\n9.\n\nThe EC therefore seeks to \"*make a written submission on one point, which it assumes to be within the scope of the dispute*\". The EC's \"*one point*\" is:\n\n*Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, properly construed, does not apply intra-EU in general, and in the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Ireland, in particular, so that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.*9\n\nEC Application, para. 23.\n\n10.\n\nAs to the third requirement, the EC submits that as \"*guardian of the EU treaties and external representative of the Union*\", it has a \"*significant interest*\" in: (i) the \"*proper interpretation of the EU Treaties and the* [ECT]\"; and (ii) the \"*avoidance of conflict between the EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention*\".10\n\nEC Application, para. 42.\n\n11.\n\nAs to the proposed procedure for its intervention, the EC submits that some tribunals in prior proceedings had \"*authorized the Commission not only to file written* amicus curiae *submissions, but also to attend the relevant part of the oral procedure*\".11 The EC confirms that it is \"*willing and prepared to participate in the hearing(s) scheduled to take place in the current proceedings*\", should the Tribunal \"*deem it useful*\".12\n\nEC Application, para. 44.\n\nEC Application, para. 45.\n\n12.\n\nOn that basis, the EC seeks that the Tribunal:\n\na. grant the EC leave to intervene in the proceedings;\n\nb. set a deadline for the EC to file a written *amicus curiae* submission;\n\nc. allow the EC access to the documents filed in the case, to the extent necessary for the preparation of the *amicus curiae* submission; and\n\nd. allow the EC \"*to attend hearings in order to present oral argument and reply to the questions of the Arbitral Tribunal at those hearings, should the Arbitral Tribunal deem that useful*\", noting that it \"*could also be invited as an expert on EU law, rather than as a non-disputing party*\".13\n\nEC Application, para. 46.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Observations**\n----------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants observe that the Tribunal should reject the Application, which they argue \"*purports to distort the institution of* amicus curiae\" because ICSID arbitration \"*is not the place for the Commission to drive its political agenda*\".14\n\nClaimants' Observations, para. 3.\n\n14.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants observe that: (i) the EC's \"*intervention will not assist the Tribunal in a manner that is different from Germany*\" and the EC \"*does not have a significant interest in the resolution of the present dispute*\", thus failing to meet two of the requirements of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2):15 (ii) the Application should be rejected on the grounds of procedural fairness and efficiency;16 and, in the alternative, (iii) any submission should be limited to points of law on which the Respondent cannot assist and subject to an undertaking as to costs.17\n\nClaimants' Observations, paras. 5-24.\n\nClaimants' Observations, paras. 25-41.\n\nClaimants' Observations, paras. 42-43.\n\n15.\n\nAs to the first requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the Claimants submit that it is \"*not sufficient for a third party seeking to intervene in arbitration proceedings to show that it has extensive knowledge in the subject-matter of its application*\", but that it \"*must demonstrate that, in addition to its knowledge, it would be able to contribute further information in a way that is different from that of the disputing parties*\".18\n\nClaimants' Observations, para. 7.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that \"*the first criteria set out in Rule 37(2)(a) cannot be satisfied in circumstances in which (i) the disputing parties have already exchanged several submissions in relation to the object of the purported non-disputing party's submission and (ii) the purported non- disputing party's submission will not add anything to the sum of already available information*\".19 According to the Claimants, the EC intervention \"*is solely aimed at repeating Germany's EU Objection, which has already been extensively ventilated, and the Commission's submissions would not offer a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of Germany*\".20\n\nClaimants' Observations, para. 9, citing **CL-0216**, *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v.

In particular, they request that:\n\na. the submission be limited to EU law questions relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\nb. the EC be denied access to the case file on the grounds that the EC's argument is exclusively based on the EU nationality of the Parties and any materials required by the EC to entertain its EU law arguments are either in the public domain or already in its possession;\n\nc. the EC be prevented from attending the hearing; and\n\nd. the EC be ordered to undertake to bear any costs arising from its intervention.28\n\nClaimants' Observations, paras. 42-43.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent observes that it \"*fully supports*\" the EC's Application and submits that the requirements of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) are met.29\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 2.\n\n23.\n\nAs to the first requirement of Rule 37(2), assisting the Tribunal through a different perspective, particular knowledge or insight, the Respondent reiterates the points raised by the EC in its Application, noting its role as the \"*guardian of the EU Treaties*\", to \"*supervise their correct application*\" and its status in representing the EU \"*externally in negotiations of the legal instruments at hand*\".30\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 7.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that it is \"*important to hear one of the original authors' perspectives on this provision and benefit from the* [EC]*'s particular knowledge and insight*\", and urges that the Tribunal \"*not pass up this chance to hear such unique perspective and benefit from the particular knowledge when deciding the matter of jurisdiction*\".31\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 7.\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the EC's \"s*ubmission on the issue of Art. 26 ECT* [\u2026] *would assist the Tribunal in the determination of the legal issue of jurisdiction*\", which is \"*particularly important as a judicial dialogue with the [Court of Justice of the European Union] via preliminary proceedings in accordance with Art. 267 TFEU and Art. 19 (3)(b) TEU is not possible within this arbitration*\".32 It further submits that, as \"*guardian of the EU Treaties*\", the EC would offer a \"*perspective, particular knowledge and insight that is different*\", and due to its \"*unique and special role*\" the EC \"*is capable of making a contribution, i.e. providing* [its] *perspective on the EU Treaties, which would assist the Tribunal in the determination of the legal issue of jurisdiction*\".33\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 11.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 12.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition to reiterating the EC's points on the EC's \"*specific knowledge of the motivation to initiate the negotiation of the ECT, the content of the respective negotiation and drafting history as well as finally the execution of the ECT*\", 34 the Respondent further submits that the EC would be able to report on the January 2019 Declaration,35 and \"*assist the Tribunal in determining the application of Art. 26 ECT*\".36\n\nRespondent Observations, paras. 13-15.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 16.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 17.\n\n27.\n\nAs to the second requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the Respondent submits that the EC's submission would address \"*the legal matter of jurisdiction under the ECT in an intra-EU investor-State arbitration*\",37 and that \"[t]*he topic of jurisdiction, i.e. the correct interpretation of Art. 26 (4)(a)(i) ECT is in dispute between the Parties here as well, as Claimants wrongfully maintain that Art. 26 ECT applies in intra-EU investor-State-arbitrations*\".38\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 18.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 19.\n\n28.\n\nSpecifically, according to the Respondent, \"*the ECT is part of EU law*\" and \"*EU law is relevant with regard to 'the measures contested by the Claimants [that] transpose into German law one of the options offered under the EU Directive on Renewable Energy, i.e. binding EU legislation* [...]'\",39 and as described by the EC \"*'the measures contested by the Claimants may constitute State aid in the sense of Article 107(1) TFEU [which] may mean that any legitimate expectations are excluded'*\".40\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 20, quoting EC Application, para. 27.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 20, quoting EC Application, para. 28.\n\n29.\n\nAs to the relationship between Article 26 of the ECT and EU law, the Respondent submits that the EC's position that \"*an investor from one EU Member State investing in another EU Member State as not covered by the ECT's notion of an 'investor' making an investment in the 'Area' of 'another Contracting Party' as such an investor is investing within the same economic area*,41 falls within the scope of the dispute in these proceedings. In this regard, the Respondent also refers to the Court of Justice of the European Union's (\"**CJEU**\") judgments in *Achmea*, *Komstroy* and *European Food*, as well as the SCC arbitral award in *Green Power*.42\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 21.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 22, and the cases cited therein.\n\n30.\n\nAs to the third requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the Respondent observes that the EC \"*has a significant interest in the proceeding and specifically in the proper interpretation of the EU Treaties and the ECT as well as the avoidance of conflict between the EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention since it is the 'guardian of the EU Treaties'*\".43\n\nRespondent Observations, paras. 9, 25-30.\n\n31.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"*When deciding the issue of jurisdiction, this Tribunal is not operating in a vacuum, and even though there is no* stare decisis *rule in international investment arbitration law, this Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction will have an impact on the intra-EU investment community in energy matters*\", a matter that it submits \"*is of interest for the entire ECT community*\".44 It further observes that the EC \"[a]*s 'guardian of the EU Treaties' and a driving force behind the creation of the ECT,* [\u2026] *has an interest in ensuring the proper interpretation of both instruments*\",45 and \"*has had to take a lot of initiatives to educate about misunderstandings and avoid conflict between the EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention*\".46\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 27.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 28.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 29.\n\n32.\n\nIn summary, according to the Respondent, the EC \"*has a significant interest in helping this Tribunal achieve a harmonious interpretation*\".47\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 29.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, as to procedural efficiency and fairness, the Respondent submits that the EC's intervention would not \"*disrupt or prolong the proceeding, unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either Party*\" because the EC \"*wishes to assist this Tribunal in a very specific question, with particular knowledge and in an unbiased way*\". 48 The Respondent further submits that there is \"*no intention or possibility on the part of the* [EC] *to hinder or interrupt the arbitral proceedings in any way, so that the integrity of the arbitral proceedings will not be affected*\".49\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 9.\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 9. *See also* paras. 31-34.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent proposes that the procedure for the EC's intervention should involve two stages: that the Tribunal should (i) invite the EC to submit its *amicus curiae* brief before the filing of the Claimants' Reply scheduled for 5 May 2023; and (ii) allow the EC to make another submission at a later stage in the proceeding, after the Respondent has filed its Rejoinder scheduled for 4 August 2023.50\n\nRespondent Observations, para. 35.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the EC Application and the Parties' Observations, including as summarised above.\n\n36.\n\nThe basis for the EC's Application is Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides as follows:\n\n*After consulting both parties, the Tribunal may allow a person or entity that is not a party to the dispute (in this Rule called the \"non-disputing party\") to file a written submission with the Tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute. In determining whether to allow such filing, the Tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which:*\n\n*(a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties;*\n\n*(b) the non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;*\n\n*(c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding.*\n\n*The Tribunal shall ensure that the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party, and that both parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the non-disputing party submission.*\n\n37.\n\nPursuant to Rule 37(2), the four primary factors the Tribunal shall consider when deciding whether or not to allow a non-disputing party to file a written submission are:\n\na. whether or not the submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of factual or legal issues related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing Parties;\n\nb. whether or not the submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;\n\nc. whether or not the EC has a significant interest in the proceeding; and\n\nd. whether or not the EC intervention will disrupt the efficiency of the proceedings, or the equality of the Parties.\n\n38.\n\nThe first factor in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) requires that the non-disputing party intervention bring a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different to that of the Parties, which would assist the Tribunal in the determination of factual or legal issues. In these proceedings, the relevant issue, according to both the EC and the Respondent, is the legal question as to whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claim pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT, including in the context of the interaction between the ECT, the EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent clearly has put in issue in these proceedings the effect of the interaction of the ECT, EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention on the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Therefore, this is an issue that the Tribunal must determine. Accordingly, the question for the purposes of this Application is whether or not a separate third-party intervention from the EC would assist the Tribunal to determine that issue because the EC offers a different perspective, particular knowledge or insight, than that of the Parties (and in particular the Respondent).\n\n40.\n\nThis is a difficult question determinatively to answer in the abstract. On the one hand, as the Claimants have pointed out, the EC's submission may mirror and simply be duplicative of the jurisdictional arguments already put forward by the Respondent. The Claimants' concerns in this regard are not entirely without basis, as is evidenced by the duplicative nature of the Respondent's observations in respect of this Application.\n\n41.\n\nUltimately, the EC's position as to the effect of the interaction of the ECT, EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention on the Tribunal's jurisdiction may do no more than mirror the Respondent's position and add no new substantive analysis or argument. Nevertheless, the EC is a separate administrative entity, which is subject to its own governance and decision-making functions. Whilst its positions on certain matters will align with that of the EU Member States, including the Respondent, its processes are separate and may involve additional aspects that are either not known to the current Respondent representatives, or otherwise not put forward by them.\n\n42.\n\nTherefore, the EC's perspective as to the effect of the interaction of the ECT, EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention on the Tribunal's jurisdiction, in addition to that of the constituent EU Member States, would assist the Tribunal, even if it were to transpire that the EC perspective ultimately mirrors the Respondent's perspective.\n\n43.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the EC's knowledge and insight would bring a perspective different from that of the Parties and would assist the Tribunal in its consideration of the Respondent's *ratione voluntatis* jurisdictional objection.\n\n44.\n\nThe second factor in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) requires that the EC's intervention will address a matter within the scope of the dispute. In this regard, the EC explains that it seeks to make a written submission on one specific issue in dispute, which is that:\n\n*Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, properly construed, does not apply intra-EU in general, and in the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Ireland, in particular, so that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.*51\n\nEC Application, para. 23.\n\n45.\n\nThe EC correctly assumes that the Respondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis of the application of Article 26 of the ECT, to claims between investors from EU Member States and Respondent EU Member States, including based on the January 2019 Declaration, which the Respondent signed. Therefore, the proper construction of ECT Article 26 in disputes involving an investor from an EU Member State and an EU Member State respondent, is within the scope of the dispute.\n\n46.\n\nThe EC also refers to an issue of State aid, arguing that \"*the measures contested by the Claimants may constitute State aid in the sense of Article 107(1) TFEU. That may mean that any legitimate expectations are excluded*\".52 The Tribunal understands, however, that the EC mentions this merely to enumerate the issues of EU law that may have been put to the Tribunal, given that the EC is not privy to the Parties' submissions on this matter. This does not mean that the EC wishes to make a submission on issues of State aid.\n\nEC Application, para. 28.\n\n47.\n\nThe third factor in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) is that the EC must have a significant interest in this proceeding. This is an arbitration brought by investors, including nationals of EU Member States, against Germany, another EU Member State. Pursuant to the EC's responsibility to \"*ensure the application of the Treaties and its measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them*\" and to \"*oversee the application of* [EU] *law under the control of the* [CJEU]\",53 the Tribunal accepts that the EC has an interest in ensuring that when the Tribunal assesses its jurisdiction, it takes into consideration the EC's perspective on the compatibility of EU law and ECT Article 26.\n\nEC Application, citing TEU, Art. 17(1) (available at : https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M%2FTXT).\n\n48.\n\nFinally, ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) further requires that the admission of a non-disputing party's written submission not interfere with efficiency and due process, stating in that regard as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal shall ensure that the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party, and that both parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the non-disputing party submission.*\n\n49.\n\nIn the current proceeding, the Tribunal considers itself capable of making directions to permit the intervention of the EC in a manner that will not disrupt the proceeding and not unduly burden or unfairly prejudice the Parties. In this regard, it considers the following factors to be relevant:\n\na. as to timing, the EC Application was submitted on 3 October 2022, 18 months after the Request for Arbitration, six months after the Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and five months after the Claimants' Memorial on Jurisdiction, but prior to both the Claimants' and the Respondent's responsive memorials, providing the Parties with an opportunity to respond without impacting the schedule;\n\nb. as to scope, the EC Application has confined its intervention to one written submission on a single issue;\n\nc. also as to scope, the single issue in question is an issue that the Respondent has raised that is or should be well-known to the Claimants' representatives; and\n\nd. as to convenience, the real possibility that any EC submission addressing the single issue in question will mirror submissions already made by the Respondent, if anything, reduces any additional burden for the Claimants in making any response.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that an additional submission nevertheless will require additional effort by the Claimants and the Respondent to review its contents and make any responsive points. That effort will take time and result in additional cost. As the position of the EC appears to align more closely with that of the Respondent, any additional cost is more likely to affect the Claimants.\n\n51.\n\nHowever, ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) does not require the Tribunal to ensure no additional burden or prejudice at all to the Parties; it instead requires no *undue* burden and no *unfair* prejudice. In the circumstances, given the limited nature of the EC intervention as directed in this Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal does not consider any additional burden, on the Claimants in particular, to be undue or any prejudice to be unfair.\n\n52.\n\nThis is because the proceeding is still at a stage where both Parties will have an opportunity to address the EC's written submission within the current schedule. The Claimants are yet to submit their Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits and the Respondent is yet to submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits in which they will have an opportunity to address the EC's submission. The Parties will have an additional opportunity to address the EC's written submission during the hearing and in any potential post-hearing submissions, if necessary. Therefore, the EC's written submission will not disrupt the proceeding and the existing procedural calendar will be maintained.\n\n53.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent has consented to and supports the EC intervention and, accordingly, cannot be said to be unduly burdened or prejudiced as a result. The Claimants have not so consented, but in light of the Tribunal's directions are required to respond to an additional submission by the EC dealing with a single issue, at the same time that they address the Respondent's arguments on that same issue.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n54.\n\nAccordingly, as to scope and form, the EC's intervention shall be limited to one written submission, of a maximum length of 30 pages, exclusively to focus on the issue as to whether or not:\n\n*Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, properly construed, applies intra-EU in general, and in the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Ireland, in particular, so that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.*\n\n55.\n\nAs to the date of the EC's written submission, the Tribunal determines that the EC shall submit this on or before 30 March 2023. The Claimants will have the opportunity to address this submission in their Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits on 5 May 2023 and the Respondent in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits on 4 August 2023.\n\n56.\n\nThis will ensure that both the Claimants and the Respondent will have an adequate opportunity to address the EC's written submission, without any undue disruption of the proceeding. It also maintains the equality between the Parties and ensures that neither the Claimants nor the Respondent is unduly burdened or prejudiced, as both will be able to respond to the EC's submission in writing prior to the hearing.\n\n57.\n\nThe EC has further requested that the Tribunal allow it to have access to the documents filed in the case, to the extent necessary for the preparation of the *amicus curiae* submission. The Claimants object to this request, arguing that such access is unnecessary considering that the EU law issue is based solely on the nationality of the Parties and all materials that the EC needs to prepare its submission are in the public domain or already in its possession. The Respondent has no objection to the EC accessing the case file.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimants' position; the EC written submission is limited to a single issue within its own existing knowledge and perspective. The EC's own insights and information uniquely available to it are precisely why it is being granted leave to intervene. The Tribunal sees no need for the EC to access the case file to make this submission. In the event that the EC considers that it is necessary to obtain a specific document, or part of a specific document, in order properly to prepare its written submission, it may submit a narrow and specific request to the Tribunal, which the Tribunal will then consider.\n\n59.\n\nFurther, the EC has requested that the Tribunal allow it to attend hearings in order to present oral argument and reply to the questions of the Tribunal at those hearings, \"*should the Arbitral Tribunal deem that useful*\".\n\n60.\n\nIn that regard, ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(2) provides that third-party attendance at the hearing is conditional upon the consent of both Parties:\n\n*Unless either party objects, the Tribunal, after consultation with the Secretary-General, may allow other persons, besides the parties, their agents, counsel and advocates, witnesses and experts during their testimony, and officers of the Tribunal, to attend or observe all or part of the hearings, subject to appropriate logistical arrangements. The Tribunal shall for such cases establish procedures for the protection of proprietary or privileged information.*\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants have made it clear that they do not consent to the EC's attendance. Given the absence of the Claimants' consent, and the fact that the Tribunal does not at this time deem it useful for the EC separately to present oral argument and reply to Tribunal questions at the hearing, the Tribunal does not consider this direction to be necessary or appropriate.\n\n62.\n\nFinally, the Claimants have requested that the Tribunal order the EC bear any costs arising out of its intervention. In this regard, as the EC's intervention is limited to one 30-page, written submission on a single and narrow issue, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary or appropriate for it to make any order for costs at this time. The Tribunal reserves the right to revisit this decision, after it has reviewed the EC's submission or if there is a change of circumstances.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n63.\n\nHaving considered the EC's Application and the Parties' Observations, and for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides and orders as follows:\n\na. the EC's request to intervene is granted on the following basis:\n\ni. the EC's intervention is limited to one written submission no longer than 30 pages;\n\nii. the written submission shall address the single issue whether or not, from the EC's perspective, Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, properly construed, applies intra-EU in general, and in the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Ireland, in particular, so that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction; and\n\niii. the written submission is due on or before 30 March 2023;\n\nb. the EC's request to access the case file is denied;\n\nc. the EC's request to attend the hearing is denied;\n\nd. the Claimants' request that the EC bear the costs arising out of its intervention at the time of this Order is denied; and\n\ne. all costs in the arbitration are otherwise reserved.\n\n64.\n\nThis Order shall be communicated to the Agents designated by the EC who shall not communicate it to third parties or make use of it outside the present proceeding.\n\nDate: 1 February 2023"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 8", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2023-07-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 8\n----------------------\n\n**I.

THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Application**\n---------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants seek Tribunal recommendations that the Respondent:\n\na. withdraws its appeal against the decision issued on 28 April 2022 by the Higher Regional Court of Berlin (*Kammergericht* or \"**Berlin Court**\") rejecting its application that the present arbitration proceedings brought under ICSID Case No. ARB/21/26 (\"**Arbitration**\") be declared \"*inadmissible*\" pursuant to section 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (*Zivilprozessordnung* or \"**ZPO**\") (\"**Germany's Appeal**\"), which is currently pending before the German Federal Court of Justice (*Bundesgerichtshof* or \"**BGH**\") in docket I ZB 43/22; and\n\nb. withdraws or discontinues with prejudice any other application or proceedings against any of the Claimants or related entities initiated before any national court, which application or proceedings has any connection to the present Arbitration; and\n\nc. refrains from initiating any further applications or proceedings against any of the Claimants or related entities before any national court that have the purpose of preventing the Claimants or related entities from continuing the Arbitration, including requests for any kind of injunctive relief, or recognition or exequatur proceedings; or\n\nd. in the alternative to (c) (but without prejudice to (a) and (b)), notifies the Claimants and the Tribunal well in advance of any further filing before any national court with a connection to the Arbitration so that the Claimants are put in a position to apply for new provisional measures before the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nBy way of background to the Application, according to the Claimants, on 17 May 2023, the German Federal Court of Justice or *Bundesgerichtshof* (\"**BGH**\"), Germany's highest court of civil and criminal jurisdiction, located in Karlsruhe, heard the Respondent's Appeal and during the hearing or on the same day the BGH:\n\na. \"*expressed the view that 'there cannot be any doubt that' the Tribunal could not have jurisdiction as a matter of EU law*\";\n\nb. \"*indicated to the Parties its strong inclination to uphold Germany's Appeal and to issue a decision that the Arbitration be declared 'inadmissible' pursuant to section 1032(2) of the [German Civil Code of Procedure (or the Zivilprozessordnung) (**Exhibit C-0284**)] ZPO*\"; and\n\nc. notified the Claimants that it would issue a decision on Germany's Appeal on 27 July 2023.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the BGH's position is \"*very unlikely to change*\" and that without the provisional relief sought:\n\na. \"*the integrity of the Arbitration and indeed the integrity of ICSID arbitration are at risk*\";\n\nb. the BGH decision would be \"*the very first of its kind*\" declaring arbitration proceedings conducted under the ICSID Convention inadmissible;\n\nc. its legal basis would be a German law provision applicable to arbitration proceedings with a seat, or at least with a seat of the arbitration to be determined, as opposed to ICSID arbitration; and\n\nd. it would seriously undermine the integrity of the ICSID Convention, including the principles of consent (Article 25 of the ICSID Convention) and competence-competence (Article 41 of the ICSID Convention). Section 1032(2) of the ZPO provides that \"*[u]ntil the arbitral tribunal has been formed, a request may be filed with the court to have it determine the admissibility or inadmissibility of arbitral proceedings*\" (**C-0284**, Official English translation of the ZPO, Article 1032(2)).\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants' Application (i) summarises the relevant circumstances that gave rise to the Application; (ii) sets out and applies the applicable standard for provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules; (iii) seeks to demonstrate that the Recommendations meet each of these standards; (iv) provides a timeline; and (v) describes the relief sought.\n\n7.\n\nFirst, as to the circumstances giving rise to the Application, the Claimants submit as follows:\n\na. on 17 August 2021, shortly before the constitution of the Tribunal and while the Parties were in discussion with ICSID regarding a president, the Respondent filed a petition for declaratory relief before the Berlin Court seeking that the Arbitration be declared \"*inadmissible*\" pursuant to section 1032(2) of ZPO (\"**Petition**\");\n\nb. the Respondent did not notify the Claimants or the Tribunal that it had filed the Petition;\n\nc. on 12 October 2021, Germany filed an application for the early dismissal of Mainstream's claims pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, omitting to mention the Petition;\n\nd. on 18 October 2021, the Claimants' counsel received a letter from the Berlin Court by post enclosing the Petition and providing a period of one month for response;\n\ne. on 26 October 2021, at the First Session in the arbitration, the Claimants notified the Tribunal about the Petition;\n\nf. on 28 October 2021, the Respondent provided a copy of its Petition;\n\ng. on 28 April 2022, the Berlin Court dismissed the Petition with costs, finding that \"*petitions for declaratory relief on the basis of section 1032(2) of the ZPO are not available in the context of arbitration proceedings conducted on the basis of the ICSID Convention, which establishes a self-contained regime*\" (the \"**Decision**\");\n\nh. on 6 May 2022, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Berlin Court Decision together with their Memorial on Jurisdiction;\n\ni. on 20 May 2022, the Respondent appealed the Decision before the BGH (the \"**Appeal**\"); and\n\nj. on 17 May 2023, the BGH heard the appeal in Karlsruhe, Germany,1 and issued a resolution (\"*Protokoll*\") indicating that \"*the date for the pronouncement of a decision [on Germany's Appeal] is set for Thursday, 27 July 2023, 8.30 a.m., room E101*\".\n\nTogether with appeals by RWE AG (\"**RWE**\") and Uniper SE (\"**Uniper**\") against the Court of Appeal of Cologne (*Oberlandesgericht* or \"**OLG**\") decisions dated 1 September 2022 that the arbitration proceedings brought by RWE and Uniper against the Netherlands in ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/21/4 and ARB/21/22 were \"*inadmissible*\" pursuant to section 1032(2) of the ZPO.\n\n8.\n\nBased on accompanying evidence of an attendee at the Appeal hearing on 17 May 2023, the Claimants are strongly of the view that the BGH will grant the appeal.\n\n9.\n\nSecondly, as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to grant the relief sought, the Claimants rely on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Claimants submit that \"*[a]lthough Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules use the verb 'to recommend,' it is well-settled that provisional measures granted by ICSID tribunals are legally binding*\",2 and that ICSID tribunals have issued orders for provisional measures in order to enjoin a respondent State from pursuing parallel domestic proceedings,3 referring in particular to *WOC v. Spain*.4\n\nSee, for instance, **CL-0281**, *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 October 1999, para. 9; **CL-0282**, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1 (Procedural Measures), 1 July 2003, para. 4: \"*It is to be recalled that, according to a well-established principle laid down by the jurisprudence of the ICSID tribunals, provisional measures 'recommended' by an ICSID tribunal are legally compulsory; they are in effect 'ordered' by the tribunal, and the parties are under a legal obligation to comply with them*\"; **CL-0283**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

Schreuer, A. Sinclair, *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention*, Volume 1, 3rd edition, Cambridge 2022, pp. 606-607, paras 255-266.\n\n**CL-0289**, *WOC Photovoltaik Portfolio GmbH & Co. KG and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/22/12, Decision on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 3 May 2023, para. 116.\n\n10.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the criteria to consider in determining the Application are:5\n\na. the existence of *prima facie* jurisdiction over the arbitration;\n\nb. the existence of rights that require protection by way of provisional measures;\n\nc. the urgency and necessity of the measures requested; and\n\nd. the proportionality of those measures.\n\n**CL-0289**, *WOC Photovoltaik Portfolio GmbH & Co. KG and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/22/12, Decision on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 3 May 2023, para. 76; **CL-0290**, *Gerald International Limited v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/1, Procedural Order No. 7, 11 July 2022, para. 65. See also **CL-0292**, Koh/Yeo, \"Rule 47\", in Happ and Wilske (eds.), *ICSID Rules and Regulations 2022*, Article-by-Article Commentary, 2022, pp. 503-510, paras 46-67.\n\n11.\n\nAs to *prima facie* jurisdiction, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the dispute provided it is able to \"*satisfy itself that upon an initial analysis, i.e. 'at first sight'/ prima facie, it has jurisdiction. For this, it is necessary and sufficient that the facts alleged by the Claimant establish this jurisdiction without it being necessary or possible at this stage to verify them and analyse them in depth*\".6 It contends that this is without prejudice to the Tribunal's full review of the jurisdictional arguments in due course.7 The Claimants set out their arguments as to the Tribunal's *prima facie* jurisdiction in three respects:\n\na. **Jurisdiction** ***ratione voluntatis***: in the form of the Respondent's valid consent to ICSID arbitration under the ECT and the Claimants' acceptance in its Request for Arbitration;\n\nb. **Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***: in the form of the Claimants' \"*investments*\" in Germany pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention;\n\nc. **Jurisdiction** ***ratione personae***: the First, Second and Third Claimants are companies organised under the laws of Ireland and \"*investors*\" and \"*nationals of another Contracting State*\" for the purposes of Article 1(7) of the ECT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claimants are German companies controlled by the First, Second and Third Claimants and wholly owned by the Second Claimant and therefore also \"*investors*\" and \"*nationals of another Contracting State*\" for the purposes of Article 1(7) of the ECT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**CL-0290**, *Gerald International Limited v. Republic of Sierra Leone*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/31, Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures), 28 July 2020, para. 168; **CL-0293**, *Millicom International Operations B.V. and Sentel GSM SA v. The Republic of Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/20, Decision on the Application for Provisional Measures, 9 December 2009, para. 42.\n\nSee for instance, **CL-0290**, *Gerald International Limited v. Republic of Sierra Leone*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/31, Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures), 28 July 2020, para. 173; **CL-0282**, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1 (Procedural Measures), 1 July 2003, para. 6.\n\n12.\n\nAs to the existence of rights, the Claimants argue that the German Court Proceedings endanger their ICSID arbitration rights including:\n\na. the right of access to international adjudication of their ECT claims under the ICSID Convention pursuant to Article 26(4)(a)(i) of the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;\n\nb. the right to have the dispute, including jurisdictional arguments, submitted to the exclusive authority of this Tribunal in accordance with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention;\n\nc. the right to the preservation of the *status quo* between the Parties and the non-aggravation of the dispute until a final decision on the merits is issued in accordance with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention; and\n\nd. the right to non-aggravation in that the Claimants are entitled to the issuance of a binding and enforceable award, recognised by enforcing courts as binding and subject to those courts taking the steps necessary to enforce it as a final judgment of that court, pursuant to Articles 53(1) and 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants submit that these rights \"*are being endangered by the BGH's imminent decision in the German Court Proceedings that Germany initiated without any notice to the Claimants or the Tribunal with the exclusive goal of being issued a declaration that the Arbitration is 'inadmissible' as a matter of German civil procedural law*\". They argue as follows:\n\na. regarding rights of access, the German Court Proceedings limit the Tribunal's own determination of its jurisdiction, to the extent that Germany is seeking to obtain a declaratory relief aimed at opposing the validity of the arbitration agreement underlying this Arbitration (relying on *WOC v. Spain* tribunal, \"*the Claimants' rights to access and to exclusivity, including their rights to access and to exclusivity in relation to the determination of this Tribunal's jurisdiction, are endangered by the German Proceedings*\";\n\nb. regarding the right of exclusivity, in the German Court Proceedings the Respondent is pursuing a parallel legal remedy in the German Court Proceedings (again relying on *WOC v. Spain* tribunal, \"*[e]ven if not binding upon the Tribunal, there are clearly legal consequences capable of arising out of the German Proceedings*\", such as \"*the Respondent's intended use of any declaration in the present Arbitration in support of any submissions it may make as to the validity of the arbitration agreement*\", given that \"*[r]ecourse to the German courts pursuant to Section 1032(2) of the ZPO must therefore be accepted to have legal consequences and, as such, comprise a remedy within the meaning of Article 26(1) of the ICSID Convention*\");\n\nc. regarding the right to non-aggravation, based on [REDACTED] view that the Appeal \"*very likely*\" will result in the declaratory relief, the Claimants argue that such relief will aggravate the dispute insofar as the Claimants will need to defend such relief in parallel proceedings and the Respondent will likely seek to use the relief to seek an injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding, \"*at variance with clear mandate of the [ICSID]Convention and will violate [Germany's] international obligations under the [ICSID] Convention*\";8 and\n\nd. regarding the right to an enforceable award, the effect of the relief would be for any award issued by the Tribunal to be \"*inadmissible*\" pursuant to section 1032(2) of the ZPO and therefore unenforceable in Germany, as well as \"*strong signalling effects towards enforcement courts based in other EU Member States, which may refuse to enforce any award issued by the Tribunal on similar grounds*\" and enforcement courts in non-EU Member States.\n\n**CL-0240,** S. Schill , L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, Ch. Schreuer, A. Sinclair, *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention*, Volume 1, 3rd edition, Cambridge 2022, p. 607, para. 259 (citing Judge Schwebel on \"anti-suit injunctions\").\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the recommendations they seek by way of provisional measures are necessary to preserve the Claimants' ICSID arbitration rights \"*and the integrity of the ICSID system as a whole*\". They rely on:\n\na. previous provisional measures orders that considered measures \"*necessary*\" where \"*aimed at preventing actions of a party which are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked*\",9 including *Rizzani v. Kuwait*, where the tribunal found that \"*the term 'irreparable' harm must be understood as requiring a material risk of 'serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally \"irreparable\"'*\";10\n\nb. their post-hearing submissions in the Appeal that:11\n\nNational law does not provide for the setting aside of a foreign arbitral award even in the case of (alleged) invalidity of the arbitration clause; it is only possible to refuse a declaration of enforceability for this reason.\n\nc.

Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 3 (Procedural Measures), 18 January 2005, para. 8. Adopting a similar test, see for instance: **CL-0298**, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, para. 38 (provisional measures must be necessary to \"*avoid the occurrence of irreparable harm or damage*\"); **CL-0299**, *CEMEX Caracas Investments B.V. and CEMEX Caracas II Investments B.V. v.

(ee).\n\n15.\n\nAs to the integrity of ICSID, the Claimants submit that the German Court Proceedings \"*pose a threat to the integrity of the ICSID arbitration system as whole, which is based on the autonomous and self-contained nature of the ICSID arbitration procedure, and the corollary principles of competence-competence (Article 41 of the ICSID Convention), exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration and non-interference of domestic courts (Article 26 of the ICSID Convention)*\".\n\n16.\n\nThey rely on *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention*, where he states that:\n\nArt. 26 is the clearest expression of the self-contained and autonomous nature of the arbitration procedure provided for by the Convention. [...]\n\nThe first sentence of Art. 26 has two main features. The first is that, once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to seek relief in another forum, national or international, and are restricted to pursuing their claim through ICSID arbitration. This principle operates from the moment of valid consent. [...]\n\nThe second feature of Art. 26, first sentence, is that of non-interference with the ICSID arbitration process, once it has been instituted. The principle of non-interference is a consequence of the self-contained nature of proceedings under the Convention. The Convention provides for an elaborate process designed to make arbitration independent of domestic courts. Even in the face of an uncooperative party, ICSID arbitration is designed to proceed independently without the support of domestic courts. This is evidenced by the provisions on the constitution of the tribunal (Arts. 37-40), on proceedings in the absence of a party (Art. 45(2)), on autonomous arbitration rules (Art. 44), on applicable law (Art. 42(1)), and on provisional measures (Art. 47). It is only in the context of enforcement that domestic courts may enter the picture (Arts. 54-55).\n\n17.\n\nThe specific risk that they seek to avert is that the Respondent will rely on the relief to further interfere with the Claimants' ICSID rights \"*either by raising arguments on the basis of the Declaratory Relief in the course of this Arbitration or by applying for injunctive relief before domestic courts with the aim of preventing the Claimants from pursuing the Arbitration*\". They suggest that this is a risk evidenced by the Respondent's \"*procedural attitude in relation to the EU Objection and relentless commitment to oppose the Tribunal's jurisdiction in this arbitration*\", and refer to the Respondent:\n\na. commencing the German Court Proceedings;\n\nb. requesting to bifurcate the arbitration;\n\nc. making two additional applications in the Arbitration, \"*exclusively aimed at putting an end or staying the Arbitration*\", in which it failed to mention the German Court Proceedings; and\n\nd. \"*fiercely opposing the Tribunal's jurisdiction in no less than five written submissions*\".\n\n18.\n\nAs to urgency, the Claimants rely on the prior ICSID provisional measures decision in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine* to assert that a measure is urgent where \"*action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is taken*\",12 arguing that in similar decisions \"*urgency was characterised where the measures requested where aimed at preventing the issuance of conflicting decisions*\",13 or \"*the aggravation of the dispute*\".14 They make three arguments in support:\n\na. that urgency exists \"*in light of the impending BGH decision*\" to be issued on 27 July 2023 and is likely to result in \"*a declaratory judgment that the Arbitration is 'inadmissible' pursuant to section 1032(2) of the ZPO, and therefore impair the integrity of the Arbitration and the ICSID system as a whole*\", and that up until the Appeal hearing on 14 May 2023, it \"*had valid reasons to believe that the Berlin Court Decision \u2013 which dismissed Germany's Petition for Declaratory Relief \u2013 would stand before the BGH\" and that understanding \"radically changed at the Hearing*\", based on:\n\ni. [REDACTED] impression at the hearing;\n\nii. German press commentary following the hearing; and\n\niii. that \"*such outcome may also be inferred from the BGH's previous case law*\", by reference to *Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d. v. Republic of Croatia (II)* (PCA Case No. 2020-15);\n\nb. that urgency exists \"*in light of the risk of conflicting decisions as to the validity of the arbitration agreement resulting from [the Respondent's] offer to arbitrate in Article 26 of the ECT and [the Claimant's] acceptance of this offer in its Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2021*\", again relying on *WOC v. Spain*, arguing that here:\n\n\u2026 the urgency is even more acute than in the *WOC Photovoltaik Portfolio v. Spain* case, in which the tribunal had agreed to issue measures identical to the Recommendations ***at a time at which the Berlin Court \u2013 the first instance Court \u2013 had not yet ruled on Spain's application for the arbitration proceedings to be declared 'inadmissible' under section 1032(2) of the ZPO***. Further, as can be seen from the above quote, at the time of the issuance of the recommendations in that case, it was not even known when the Berlin Court would issue its decision. Conversely, in the Arbitration, the Berlin Court has already issued a decision and the decision to be issued by the BGH is imminent and scheduled to be issued in less than two months from the date of this Application. [Emphasis added]\n\nc. that urgency is necessary to prevent aggravation of the dispute, relying on *Burlington v. Ecuador* for support in the statement in the tribunal's decision that, \"*when the measures are intended to protect against the aggravation of the dispute during the proceedings, the urgency requirement is fulfilled by definition*\",15 characterising the Respondent's conduct as taking several bites of the cherry to maximise its chances of success in relation to the EU Objection, constituting an abuse of process.\n\n**CL-0288**, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.

They refer to tribunals in prior ICSID proceedings seeking to \"*balance the harm that would be caused to (i) the applicants as a result of the preservation of* the status quo*, and (ii) the other party as a result of the issuance of the provisional measures requested*\",16 and ordering provisional measures where \"*the harm spared the petitioner 'exceed[ed] greatly the damage caused to the party affected' by it*.\"17\n\n**CL-0306**, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, 3 May 2012, para. 41.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants make three arguments as to why, in their submission, the provisional measures sought would preserve their rights and \"*the integrity of the ICSID system as a whole, while having no impact on the Respondent's rights in the Arbitration*\", and are proportional:\n\na. they have no impact on the Respondent's ability to pursue the EU Objection (or any other jurisdictional objection) in this Arbitration;\n\nb. the likely impact of the German Courts Proceedings relief \"*would render any potential award issued by the Tribunal unenforceable in Germany and would have strong 'signalling effects' towards enforcement courts based in other EU Member States and even outside of the EU*\", and the Respondent's failure to disclose the proceedings raises \"*serious grounds for concern about the consequences or further steps that the Respondent might pursue in furtherance of the [relief]*\";\n\nc. the damaging effect and serial consequences that the relief \"*might have on the ICSID system as a whole*\", encouraging other state parties to \"*pursue similar remedies in their own jurisdictions and escape their international obligations under the ICSID Convention*\".\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to the assurances provided by the Netherlands in the *RWE* and *Uniper* cases, but describe these as \"*inapposite in the present dispute*\" because: (i) they would very likely be legally unenforceable before domestic courts; and (ii) unlike in *RWE* and *Uniper*, the Respondent did not give prior notification, engaged in protracted discussions to constitute the Tribunal, and concealed the German Court Proceedings from the Claimants and Tribunal and in filing the Appeal \"*even provided demonstrably false information to the Claimants and the Tribunal*\".\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants seek relief no later than 13 July 2023, because to be effective it is required prior to the issuance of the BGH decision on 27 July 2023, so as to provide the Respondent with \"*ample time (even more than necessary) to implement*\". To facilitate this deadline, the Claimants waived their right to respond and to request a hearing on provisional measures (although expressed willingness to attend one if the Tribunal requested). According to the Claimants, the provisional measures would require Germany to take steps \"*based on an analogous application of section 516 of the ZPO, as ruled by the BGH in an order dated 25 April 2012*\".18\n\n**C-0284**, Official English translation of the German Civil Code of Procedure, section 516 and **C-0301**, Order issued by the BGH on 25 April 2012 in docket XII ZB 460/11. See also Witness Statement of[Redacted] para. 14.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that the Application must be dismissed in its entirety for two primary reasons: (i) the German Court Proceedings \"*do not interfere with this arbitration*\"; and (ii) the requirements for issuing provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are not met, as there is no necessity, urgency, or proportionality.\n\n25.\n\nFirst, as to the German Court Proceedings not interfering with the arbitration, the Respondent makes four arguments:\n\na. the Appeal aims at assessing the validity of an arbitration agreement;\n\nb. the Appeal is limited to declaratory relief;\n\nc. the German Civil Code of Procedure provision underlying the Appeal applies to ICSID proceedings;\n\nd. the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice can and will assist the Tribunal; and\n\ne. the ICSID Convention is not at issue in the German Court Proceedings.\n\n26.\n\nRegarding (a), the Respondent submits in relation to the Application that:\n\na. it \"*aims at preventing Respondent from obtaining a decision in proceedings pursuant to Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure, currently pending before the German Federal Court of Justice*\";\n\nb. it concerns an \"*appeal on points of law against a decision issued by the Higher Regional Court Berlin*\", which had \"*dismissed the application of the Federal Republic of Germany pursuant to Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure*\";\n\nc. the German Federal Court of Justice held a public hearing on 17 May 2023 (together with two other appeals on points of law in *RWE* and *Uniper*); and\n\nd. the hearing date was publicly announced on the German Federal Court of Justice's website on 8 February 2023.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure permits German courts assess the admissibility or inadmissibility of the underlying arbitration, based on the language \"*[u]ntil the arbitral tribunal has been formed, a request may be filed with the court to have it determine the admissibility or inadmissibility of arbitral proceedings*\" and does \"*not interfere with the underlying arbitration*\", because \"*[w]here proceedings as referred to in subsection (1) or (2) are pending, arbitral proceedings nevertheless may be initiated or continued and an award may be made*\".\n\n28.\n\nRegarding (b), the Respondent argues that the Claimants mischaracterise Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure, in that it:\n\n\u2026 aims at assessing whether there is a valid arbitration agreement, here pursuant to Art. 26 ECT which is invoked by Claimants. Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure does not serve the purpose of making a determination on the ICSID Convention. Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure provides for declaratory relief with *inter partes* effect. It is not capable of granting injunctive relief.\n\n29.\n\nIt denies that proceedings under Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure \"*block*\" the underlying arbitration, and its expert, [REDACTED] states that:\n\nThis procedure does not result in any claim to cease and desist from continuing with the present arbitration procedure against the defendants, the Claimants, the World Bank, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), the Tribunal in the arbitration procedure ICSID Case No. ARB/21/26 or its members. In particular, it is not an anti-arbitration injunction procedure which could halt an arbitration procedure, particularly one outside of the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n30.\n\nRegarding (c), in response to the Claimants' argument that Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure would not apply to ICSID arbitration, the Respondent notes that Section 1025, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure provides that \"*[t]he provisions of sections 1032, 1033 and 1050 are to be applied also in those cases in which the place of arbitration is located abroad or has not yet been determined*\", but denies that this excludes ICSID arbitration, claiming instead that it \"*expressly widens the scope of application with respect to Sec. 1032 German Code of Civil Procedure*\". It notes that the Claimants' argument was discussed and rejected in the Higher Regional Court Cologne decisions in *RWE AG et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands* and *Uniper SE et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*.\n\n31.\n\nRegarding (d), the Respondent submits that the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice \"*can and will assist this Tribunal when rendering its decision on jurisdiction*\", because it \"*will decide as an independent and impartial court*\", taking into account \"*all arguments advanced by the parties in the proceedings pursuant to Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure*\" and \"*decide on its competence and jurisdiction and then on the admissibility of these arbitration proceedings*\". It submits that:\n\nIt is in the interest of all Parties and the Tribunal to get the German Federal Court of Justice's view on the question of the admissibility of these arbitration proceedings. Despite the CJEU's clear jurisprudence on the inadmissibility of intra-EU investor-State arbitrations \u2013 including ICSID arbitration \u2013 and the EU Member States' obligation to give full effect to the CJEU's jurisprudence, Claimants continue to argue in this arbitration that the CJEU's jurisprudence is irrelevant for their case. The German Federal Court of Justice will provide additional insight.\n\n32.\n\nThis Tribunal decided to rule on the topic of inadmissibility of intra-EU investor-State arbitrations only when rendering its decision on the merits, denying the request for bifurcation. If and to the extent this Tribunal now grants the Claimants' Provisional Measures Application, based on mere hypotheses and guesses made by the Claimants and misjudging the nature of the proceedings pursuant to Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure, this Tribunal would not only contradict itself, but also act neither impartially nor independently, favouring one Party's legal opinion over the other.\n\n33.\n\nRegarding (e), the Respondent disagrees that a decision of the German Federal Court of Justice would undermine the integrity of the ICSID Convention and argues that \"*proceedings under Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure determine the validity of the arbitration agreement invoked by Claimants without addressing or violating the ICSID Convention*\", as the \"*German Federal Court of Justice will decide upon the validity of an arbitration agreement pursuant to Art. 26 ECT*\" on the basis of German and EU law, which it alleges means \"*the ICSID Convention is not at issue*\". It refers to [REDACTED] Witness Statement comment that \"*the German Federal Court of Justice voiced doubts that, in view of the applicable EU law, the arbitration agreement at issue is valid*\", and concludes that if there were not valid arbitration agreement, \"*the ICSID Convention does not come into play at all*\".\n\n34.\n\nSecondly, as to standard pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent submits that the requirements for issuing provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are not met because:19\n\na. \"*[t]here is no endangerment of any of Claimants' alleged rights that could be protected by ways of provisional measures*\";\n\nb. the requirements of necessity, urgency and proportionality are not fulfilled; and\n\nc. the Claimants \"*act contradictorily and not in good faith in that they make use of legal proceedings in the Federal Republic of Germany when it suits them but want to cut off Respondent from proceedings before the German courts when they fear that they may lose*\".\n\n**RL-0262**, *RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Request for Provisional Measures,\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent further states that \"*provisional measures are extraordinary measures which must not be recommended lightly*\",20 and that the burden of proof lies with the Claimants.21\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, **RL-0265**, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order of the Tribunal on the Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures, 6 September 2005, para. 38; **RL-0263**, *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Request for Provisional Measures, 28 October 1999, para. 10.\n\n**RL-0262**, *RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*, Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 16 August 2022, **Exhibit**, para. 75.\n\n36.\n\nRegarding (a) endangerment to rights, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' \"*right of access to international adjudication of their ECT claims under the ICSID Convention*\", \"*right to have the dispute [...] submitted to the exclusive authority of this Tribunal*\", \"*right to the preservation of the status quo between the Parties and to non-aggravation of the dispute*\" and right to the issuance of a binding and enforceable award are not endangered, as follows:\n\na. simply asserting the right of access is endangered is insufficient and \"*[n]either the Claimants' statement nor their citation from the findings in [WOC] includes a reasoning why the proceedings under Sec. 1032 para. 2 German Code of Civil Procedure should endanger*\" such right;\n\nb. the Claimants \"*obviously are not prevented from participating*\" in the arbitration as the Appeal \"*will be of declaratory nature*\" and Section 1032, paragraph 3 of the German Code of Civil Procedure states that the Tribunal can continue these proceedings;\n\nc. the Claimants' argument that the Appeal breaches the Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction based on *WOC v Spain*, in which the tribunal found that the \"*Respondent's intended use of any declaration in the present Arbitration in support of any submission it may make as to the validity of the arbitration agreement*\" was a legal consequence and hence a remedy within the meaning of Article 26(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"*is wrong and its concern unfounded*\";\n\nd. other tribunals found no rights are endangered where court proceedings \"*will have no foreseeable effect on the Tribunal's ability to make a determination on the issues in the arbitration*\",22 citing to *Uniper SE et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*:\n\nThe mere existence of proceedings before another judicial body does not necessarily threaten the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings. There are many situations where there may be concurrent jurisdiction between domestic courts and international investment tribunals. In order to constitute a threat to exclusivity, the other proceedings must relate to issues within the Tribunal's competence and purport to decide, or hinder the Tribunal's freedom to decide, those issues.\n\ne. the test for provisional measures to protect the integrity of the proceedings requires a link between the other proceedings and the party's ability to pursue its claims in the arbitration;23\n\nf. the Claimants' reasoning was contradictory in seeking provisional measures having accepted that this Tribunal will not be bound by the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice;\n\ng. the Claimants' concerns ignore Section 1032, paragraph 3 of the German Code of Civil Procedure \"*which explicitly states that this arbitration may continue, and the Tribunal may render an award*\";\n\nh. the right to non-aggravation of the dispute refers to actions that make resolution of the dispute by the Tribunal more difficult and to maintain the *status quo*, which does not include the Claimants having to defend themselves \"*against the Declaratory Relief in the arbitration and continue defending itself against the same relief in the German Court Proceedings, thereby incurring significant costs*\", as confirmed in *Churchill and Planet Mining v. Indonesia*:24\n\nAn allegation that the *status quo* has been altered or that the dispute has been aggravated needs to be buttressed by concrete instances of intimidation or harassment. On this basis, of the record as it presently stands, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have not met the burden of establishing conduct of this nature.\n\ni. the Appeal \"*will not render the resolution of the dispute by the Tribunal more difficult*\", there are \"*no instances of intimidation or harassment*\" and \"*[t]he decision of the German Federal Court of Justice can assist the Tribunal on EU law by, for instance, clarifying the application of the CJEU's* Achmea*,* Komstroy*,* PL Holdings European Food *and the* Romatsa *Decisions to this dispute*\";\n\nj. Claimants incur no additional costs in the German Court Proceedings because they are \"*close to final*\", and the \"*only step left appears to be the rendering of the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice on 27 July 2023*\", which \"*will be irreversible*\" with \"*no further appeals*\";\n\nk. \"*it is not correct that, the 'attempt to block the Arbitration would be \"at variance with clear mandate of the [ICSID] Convention and will violate [Germany's] international obligations under the [ICSID] Convention\"'*\", as Section 1032, paragraph 3 of the German Code of Civil Proceedings \"*expressly states that the arbitration may continue, and a tribunal may render an award*\"; and\n\nl. the CJEU *Romatsa* judgment states \"*clearly that ICSID arbitral awards in intra-EU investor-State arbitrations cannot be enforced in the EU*\", which means \"*[a]ll EU Member States, including their domestic courts, must follow the CJEU's jurisprudence*\" and \"*a provisional measure to prevent the German Federal Court of Justice from handing down a decision will not change this fact*\".\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, **RL-0265**, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, Order of the Tribunal on the Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures, 6 September 2005, para. 42.\n\n**RL-0266**, *Uniper SE, Uniper Benelux Holding B.V. and Uniper Benelux N.V. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*, ICSID Case No. ARB/21/22, Procedural Order No. 2 \u2013 Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 9 May 2022, para. 73.\n\n**RL-0267**, *Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, para. 72.\n\n37.\n\nRegarding (b), necessity, urgency and proportionality, the Respondent submits as to necessity that:\n\na. the Claimants are acting \"*contradictorily and in bad faith by attempting to cut off Respondent's access to German legal proceedings while Claimants themselves use German administrative and legal proceedings before the BSH and the German Constitutional Court, respectively*\" (being an applicant in the proceedings leading to the German Constitutional Court decision dated 30 June 2020);\n\nb. the tribunals in *RWE AG et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands* and *Uniper SE et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands* rejected requests for provisional measures against proceedings under Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure;\n\nc. the German Federal Court of Justice has been fully transparent, the Respondent has been fully transparent, and this Tribunal has been fully informed;\n\nd. the protection of the ICSID system as a whole is not a valid basis for necessity or to establish that there is a material risk of irreparable harm to the rights of a party if the measure is not granted;\n\ne. the Claimants' argument that there is a material risk of an injunction \"*shows Claimants' blunt disrespect not only regarding Respondent's attempt to fulfill its obligations under EU law, but also regarding Respondent's procedural rights in this arbitration*\", as \"*the German Federal Court of Justice's eventual decision will declare what the law is*\" and that \"*already is and will be part of this arbitration notwithstanding the exact wording and motivation of the German Federal Court of Justice's eventual decision*\", and is, in any event, a \"*mere speculation*\" and \"*[p]rovisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions*\", but rather \"*to protect the requesting party from imminent harm*\";\n\nf. Claimants \"*were informed early when the application was served onto them*\" and aware of the German Court Proceedings \"*immediately after the First Session on 28 October 2021*\", and \"*[t]here is no obligation to inform the ICSID Secretariat about proceedings before domestic courts, let alone before a tribunal has been constituted*\";\n\ng. the Respondent's 23 May 2022 letter requested this Tribunal to stay the arbitral proceedings until the German Federal Court of Justice has decided upon Respondent's appeal in the proceedings pursuant to Section 1032, paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure, meaning the Tribunal was aware of the Respondent's appeal;\n\nh. Claimants rely on *WOC v. Kingdom of Spain*, where \"*the tribunal's main argument seems to have been the Kingdom of Spain's record of prior actions in previous arbitrations*\" and the \"*Respondent has no such record*\".\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent submits as to urgency that \"*a measure is urgent where action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is given*\".25 In response to the Claimants' concern that the German Federal Court of Justice may declare the \"*inadmissibility*\" of the arbitration, the Respondent states that \"*[t]he inadmissibility of intra-EU investor-State arbitration under EU law has been determined by the CJEU ever since the CJEU's Achmea Judgment*\".\n\n**RL-0268**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 59; **RL-0271**, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v.

Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, 3rd ed. 2022, p. 1078, para. 97.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that those proceedings commenced on 18 October 2021, and the \"*Claimants have addressed these proceedings in this arbitration on multiple occasions without ever touching upon the subject of a need for provisional measures*\" and \"*have had the chance to request provisional measures for almost two years*\", delay of which demonstrates the lack of urgency.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent submits as to proportionality that provisional measures always must be proportionate, the harm, if not granted, \"*must substantially outweigh the harm of the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted*\",26 and the measures \"*may not be awarded for the protection of the rights of one party where such provisional measures would cause irreparable harm to the rights of the other party*\".27\n\n**RL-0272**, *United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Decision on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 12 May 2016, para. 107.\n\n**RL-0268**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 93.\n\n41.\n\nIn the current case, the Respondent submits that provisional measures \"*would have no impact on Respondent's rights as Respondent is free to argue the intra-EU objection in the arbitration*\", citing to the decisions in *Uniper SE et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands* and *RWE AG et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*.\n\n42.\n\nAs to the enforceability of any award, the Respondent submits that this \"*will be assessed independently from the German Federal Court of Justice's eventual decision, as follows from the CJEU's* Romatsa *Decision*\".\n\n43.\n\nIt goes on to argue that rather than the Appeal causing harm to the Claimants, the measures \"*will cause irreparable harm to Respondent, because it is nothing but an attempt to cut off Respondent's access to justice*\", as the Application is \"*an abuse of rights since it is contradictory and violates the fundamental principle of good faith*\".28 It reinforces in this regard that the Claimants \"*themselves took matters to the German courts to pursue questions that are part of this arbitration*\", being one of the applicants in the proceedings that led to the decision of the German Constitutional Court dated 30 June 2020, thus benefitting \"*from the protection that Respondent's court system provides*\" and \"*making use of the remedies offered under German law before the BSH regarding the reimbursement of costs for their projects*\". According to the Respondent, this shows the \"*Claimants' attempt to cherry pick by pursuing those legal remedies they like and rejecting those they currently consider unhelpful*\".\n\nOctober 1999, para. 10; **RL-0264**, C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, 3rd ed. 2022, p. 1075 *et seq.*, para. 85.\n\n44.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the Claimants seek to \"*deprive Respondent of its right to access to justice in a way that violates the German Constitution*\", and that \"*German courts do not tolerate anti-suit injunctions directed against proceedings pending before German courts*\", relying on a decision of the Higher Regional Court Hamm dated 2 May 2023.29\n\n**RL-0274**, Higher Regional Court Hamm, Decision dated 2 May 2023 \u2013 9 W 15/23.\n\n45.\n\nBy way of relief, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismisses the Application in its entirety and orders the Claimants to bear the costs arising out of and in connection with it.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the Tribunal has authority to recommend provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**A. Applicable Legal Standard**\n--------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe applicable legal standard is largely agreed between the Parties. The governing provisions are Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n48.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n49.\n\nArticle 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n**Provisional Measures**\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.\n\n50.\n\nNeither Article 47 nor Rule 39 provides a legal standard of review or requirements to be met. However, provisional measures are an extraordinary measure that will not be granted lightly. In order to examine whether appropriate circumstances are present, tribunals typically examine whether the provisional measures are necessary, urgent and required to avoid irreparable harm to the applicant.\n\n51.\n\nIn the current case, the Claimants characterises the standard as requiring (i) existence of *prima facie* jurisdiction over the arbitration; (ii) existence of rights that require protection by way of provisional measures; (iii) urgency and necessity of the measures requested; and (iv) proportionality of those measures. The Respondent appears to accept this standard and the Tribunal proceeds to apply it below.\n\n**B. Application of the Legal Standard**\n----------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Prima Facie Jurisdiction***\n----------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the arbitration appears to be accepted by both Parties. In light of the Tribunal's decision in respect of the Respondent's Rule 41(5) Application, insofar as *prima facie* jurisdiction is required for provisional measures, this requirement is satisfied.\n\n***(ii) Existence of Rights that Require Protection by Way of Provisional Measures***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nAs to the existence of rights requiring protection, the Claimants seek to characterise four separate rights, including access to ICSID arbitration, exclusive jurisdiction, preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation including in relation to a binding and final award. The essence of the Claimants' request for protective provisional measures, once distilled, is that the German Court Proceedings will adversely impact and undermine their ability fully to pursue their investment protection rights pursuant to the ect and the ICSID Convention.\n\n54.\n\nWithout in any way predetermining its final decision on jurisdiction or the merits of the claims pending a full hearing of the same, the Application requires the Tribunal to consider the scope of its *prima facie* jurisdiction in order to determine whether or not it is exclusive and/or prejudiced by the Appeal decision.\n\n55.\n\nArticle 26(5) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\n(a) The consent given in paragraph (3) together with the written consent of the Investor given pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules;\n\n(ii) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, 10 June 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the \"New York Convention\"); and\n\n(iii) \"the parties to a contract [to] have agreed in writing\" for the purposes of article 1 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n(b) Any arbitration under this Article shall at the request of any party to the dispute be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention. Claims submitted to arbitration hereunder shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for the purposes of article I of that Convention.\n\n56.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows (emphasis added):\n\n**Article 26**\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration ***to the exclusion of any other remedy***. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\n\n57.\n\nThe *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of this arbitration is plainly exclusive on the clear and unequivocal language of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. That jurisdiction extends to this Tribunal's ability to determine its own jurisdiction pursuant to the Convention and/or ECT. Accordingly, proceedings brought in any other fora in respect of the claims in the arbitration and jurisdiction pursuant to the ICSID Convention and ECT, including the question of jurisdiction, would be in breach of the ICSID Convention, Article 26.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent has been at pains to point out that the German Court Proceedings deal only with the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear these claims as a matter of German and EU law, as opposed to the ICSID Convention, the ECT and, presumably, principles of public international law. However, the Respondent has also put before this Tribunal, in its objection to jurisdiction in the arbitration, points of German and EU law.\n\n59.\n\nUltimately, the arguments made in the German Court Proceedings and in the arbitration arising out of the Respondent's jurisdiction case are all based on its intra-EU objection. These arguments are closely intertwined and contain overlapping arguments and issues for determination. In fact, the Respondent has repeatedly submitted that the Appeal decision will assist the Tribunal in its consideration of those issues.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent's decision to refrain from asking the German Court from determining jurisdiction pursuant to the ECT or the ICSID Convention necessarily eliminates potentially overlapping jurisdictional claims, defences and issues arising out of the Respondent's intra-EU objection.\n\n61.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes on the basis of its *prime facie* jurisdiction that the German Court Proceedings, insofar as they seek to determine the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, appear potentially to be in breach of the ICSID Convention exclusive jurisdiction clause. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent's argument that the Claimants participated in those proceedings, but the Respondent initiated the originating application to the Berlin Court to request pursuant to Section 1032(2) ZPO for a declaration that the arbitration was \"*inadmissible*\" based on its intra-EU jurisdictional objection. Therefore, any breach would lie with the Respondent.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent has raised the fact that the Claimants \"*themselves took matters to the German courts to pursue questions that are part of this arbitration*\", being one of the applicants in the proceedings that led to the decision of the German Constitutional Court dated 30 June 2020, but the Tribunal considers that this may validly fall within the scope of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and/or sufficiently deal with matters outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In any event, those proceedings were commenced more than three years ago and the Respondent has never raised them as a basis for provisional measures from this Tribunal. Indeed, these are likely the type of proceedings referred to in *Uniper SE et al. v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*, when the tribunal referred to \"*[t]he mere existence of proceedings before another judicial body does not necessarily threaten the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings*\", \"*where there may be concurrent jurisdiction between domestic courts and international investment tribunals*\".\n\n63.\n\nThe German Court Proceedings, on the other hand, relate to issues within the Tribunal's competence and may \"*purport to decide, or hinder the Tribunal's freedom to decide, those issues*\". In particular, the Respondent's German Court Proceedings seek to pre-empt and undermine the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction, at least on certain issues, pursuant to the relevant international law instruments to which the Respondent is party.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterate that jurisdiction in the arbitration remains in dispute and the aforementioned reasoning is based solely on its *prime facie* jurisdiction. The Tribunal does not in any way predetermine the outcome of its decision on jurisdiction having heard the full submissions, evidence and arguments of the Parties.\n\n***(iii) Urgency and Necessity***\n---------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nHaving determined that the Claimants do indeed have valid rights in relation to which provisional measures may arise and be appropriate, the Tribunal turns to the urgency and necessity of the requested measures.\n\n66.\n\nFirst, as to urgency, both Parties also appear to accept that a provisional measure is urgent where action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is given.30 The Tribunal also endorses that approach.\n\n**CL-0288**, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, para. 8. See also **CL-0304**, *Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark),* Provisional Measures, Order of 29 July 1991, I.C.J. Reports 1991, p. 12, para. 23. **RL-0268**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 59; **RL-0271**, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, para. 76; **RL-0264**, C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, 3rd ed. 2022, p. 1078, para. 97.\n\n67.\n\nThe challenge for the Claimants in their provisional measures Application is that the German Court Proceedings were commenced on 18 October 2021, almost two years prior. The Claimants were plainly aware of the proceedings as they have defended them in the German Court \u2013 indeed prevailing at first instance \u2013 and addressed them in the arbitration. It is only at the point at which the Claimants understand that the Appeal may not be in their favour that they are seeking urgent provisional measures.\n\n68.\n\nIn order to satisfy the requirement of urgency, the Claimants would need to establish that the decision on Appeal, as opposed to the German Court Proceedings as a whole, constituted the breach of its rights. It does not. It is the German Court Proceedings themselves that would constitute the breach of the Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction to the extent that they engage in any issues going to jurisdiction pursuant to the ICSID Convention and/or ECT, including their interrelationship with EU or German law. Insofar as the Claimants considered it appropriate to seek provisional measures from this Tribunal in respect of those proceedings, it needed to have done so at the outset, or at least as soon as it became aware of their existence.\n\n69.\n\nInsofar as \"*the measures requested were aimed at preventing the issuance of conflicting decisions*\",31 or \"*the aggravation of the dispute*\",32 this risk arose almost two years ago. The Claimants cannot plead urgency only now, over 18 months into the German Court Proceedings, once the outcome looks to be turning against them.\n\nApplication, para 42; **CL-0289**, *WOC Photovoltaik Portfolio GmbH & Co. KG and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/22/12, Decision on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 3 May 2023, para. 97.\n\n**CL-0295**, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, 29 June 2009, para. 74; **CL-0284**, *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) [I]*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, 19 November 2007, para. 55.\n\n70.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the necessary requirement of urgency does not exist in the current situation, because the Claimants seek provisional measures in respect of proceedings likely commenced in breach of the ECT and ICSID Convention, only once the final appeal in those proceedings was imminent.\n\n71.\n\nSecondly, as to necessity, the requested measures must be required or necessary in order to avoid imminent harm to the rights of the Claimants. In this regard, the Respondent has provided its assurances that:\n\na. this Tribunal will not be bound by the decision of the German Federal Court of Justice;\n\nb. the Claimants' concerns are addressed by Section 1032, paragraph 3 of the German Code of Civil Procedure \"*which explicitly states that this arbitration may continue, and the Tribunal may render an award*\";\n\nc. the enforceability of any award \"*will be assessed independently from the German Federal Court of Justice's eventual decision, as follows from the CJEU's* Romatsa *Decision*\"; and\n\nd. \"*it is not correct that, the 'attempt to block the Arbitration would be \"at variance with clear mandate of the [ICSID] Convention and will violate [Germany's] international obligations under the [ICSID] Convention\"'*\", as Section 1032, paragraph 3 of the German Code of Civil Proceedings \"*expressly states that the arbitration may continue, and a tribunal may render an award*\".\n\n72.\n\nOn the basis of reassurances from the Respondent as to its position that the German Court Proceedings are not an attempt to block either the arbitration or the enforcement of the award, and that both would proceed independently of the German Court Proceedings, the necessity for the provisional measures is also unclear. Insofar as the cost associated with the German Court Proceedings causes additional loss to the Claimants, they may be able to identify a legal basis to seek to recover those in these proceedings.\n\n73.\n\nMoreover, as the Respondent has also pointed out, the issue before the German Court has already been considered by the CJEU and determined by that court in favour of the Respondent's position. The Tribunal notes in this regard the Respondent's restated position that \"*[t]he inadmissibility of intra-EU investor-State arbitration under EU law has been determined by the CJEU ever since the CJEU's Achmea Judgment*\", the CJEU *Romatsa* judgment states \"*clearly that ICSID arbitral awards in intra-EU investor-State arbitrations cannot be enforced in the EU*\", and therefore \"*[a]ll EU Member States, including their domestic courts, must follow the CJEU's jurisprudence*\" and \"*a provisional measure to prevent the German Federal Court of Justice from handing down a decision will not change this fact*\".\n\n74.\n\nIn this regard, the clear tenor of the Respondent's submissions objecting to the provisional measures Application is that the outcome of the Appeal will merely replicate the outcome in the CJEU and other EU member state court decisions and therefore not change the existing *status quo*. That position does rather beg the question why the German Court Proceedings were commenced, and in particular why they were commenced at a time when this Tribunal was in the process of being constituted. However, that is a matter for costs in due course, as opposed to a basis for provisional measures in this case.\n\n75.\n\nOn the basis of the Respondent's reassurances therefore, the Tribunal finds that the provisional measures are also not necessary to prevent additional harm to the Claimants, because their right to have this Tribunal determine its jurisdiction over their claims pursuant to the ECT and ICSID Convention is unimpacted by the German Court Proceedings.\n\n***(iv) Proportionality***\n--------------------------\n\n76.\n\nFinally, as to proportionality, the relevant harm \"*must substantially outweigh the harm of the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted*\",33 and the measures \"*may not be awarded for the protection of the rights of one party where such provisional measures would cause irreparable harm to the rights of the other party*\".34\n\n**RL-0272**, *United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Decision on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 12 May 2016, para. 107.\n\n**RL-0268**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 93.\n\n77.\n\nIn the current situation, in light of the Tribunal's decision as to urgency and necessity above, the Tribunal is not required to consider the factor of proportionality, including but not limited to whether or not the Respondent had a right to commence the German Court Proceedings during the constitution of the Tribunal in the arbitration, or the need to do so in light of its submission that the matter it seeks to have determined in the German Court Proceedings is already resolved by the CJEU.\n\n78.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal does not find the urgency or necessity for the particular relief sought at this time, primarily because the German Court Proceedings have been underway for some time and the only new factor is that the Appeal decision may be adverse to the Claimant. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is concerned that there is a future risk that the Respondent may commence additional proceedings, or seek remedy based on or enforcement of the Appeal decision, that may be contrary to this Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore, whilst not granting the provisional measures as sought, the Tribunal considers it necessary and appropriate to make a firm recommendation to the Respondent to refrain from doing so or, at minimum, to notify the Claimants and Tribunal well in advance of any steps to do so.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n79.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Tribunal:\n\na. declines to order the Respondent to withdraw Germany's Appeal, which is currently pending before the BGH in docket I ZB 43/22; and\n\nb. declines to order the Respondent to withdraw or discontinue with prejudice any other application or proceedings against any of the Claimants or related entities initiated before any national court, which application or proceedings has any connection to the present Arbitration.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal does however require that the Respondent:\n\na. refrains from initiating any further applications or proceedings against any of the Claimants or related entities before any national court that have the purpose of preventing the Claimants or related entities from continuing the Arbitration, including requests for any kind of injunctive relief, or recognition or exequatur proceedings; or, at minimum,\n\nb. notifies the Claimants and the Tribunal well in advance of any further filing before any national court with a connection to the Arbitration so that the Claimants are put in a position to apply for new provisional measures before the Tribunal.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal defers any question of costs in connection with the request for provisional measures for consideration at a later stage in this Arbitration.\n\nDate: 17 July 2023"}]}
