I agree with many of the majority\u2019s conclusions in the Award, but on the key question of whether there has been a violation of Article 1105.1 cannot agree.\n\n2.\n\nIn large part, my disagreement is with the majority\u2019s assessment of the facts, whether the report of the Joint Review Panel (JRP or \"the Panel\") through endorsing the concept of \"community core values\" and its treatment of the requirement of a \"significant effects analysis\", \"departed in fundamental ways from the standard of evaluation required by the laws of Canada\".1 At the same time, my disagreement is with the effect of the majority\u2019s decision on the threshold for the application of the standard under Article 1105. The majority accepts the well-known statement in *Waste Management2* as encapsulating the standard to be applied under Article 1105 and acknowledges that it is a \"high threshold\".3 But it applies the standard in a way that it is met simply by an allegation of a breach of Canadian law.\n\nAward, para. 594.\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, paras. 98 and 99.\n\nAward, para. 444.\n\n**The Basis of the Majority\u2019s Approach**\n----------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe key component of the majority\u2019s conclusion that there has been a violation of Article 1105 is that the JRP relied upon the concept of \"community core values\".4 Less central, but also an important part of the majority\u2019s conclusion, is that the JRP did not provide in its report an assessment of the mitigation measures that might have been taken to avoid the significant environmental effects of the project.5 Both of these, in the majority\u2019s view, take the JRP\u2019s conclusions outside the scope of what is required by Canadian law. But, even if there had been a potential breach of Canadian law, this would not of itself constitute a breach of NAFTA Article 1005.6 I will return to these matters shortly.\n\nAward, para. 452: \"The \u2018community core values\u2019 approach of the Joint Review Panel was the decisive and overriding consideration.\"\n\n*Ibid.* \"The Joint Review Panel did not carry out its mandate to conduct a \u2018likely significant effects after mitigation\u2019 analysis to the whole range of potential project effects, as required by the *CEAA* \"\n\n*Garni Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL Award, 15 November 2004, para. 95: \"A failure to satisfy requirements of national law does not necessarily violate international law.\"\n\n4.\n\nThe majority includes in its analysis factors other than the actions of the JRP, intended to support its conclusion that there has been a breach of Article 1105. In particular, it concludes that the Claimant had \"legitimate\" or \"reasonable\" expectations based on encouragement by the government of Nova Scotia to invest in mining in the province, and at the White\u2019s Point site, in particular.7 The expectation of the Claimant, the majority asserts, was that \"it would only obtain environmental permission if the project satisfied the requirements of the laws of federal Canada and Nova Scotia.\"8 This also encouraged the Claimant to spend substantial sums of money developing the project.9\n\nAward, para. 448, \"The Investors reasonably relied on specific encouragements, at the political and technical level, to pursue the project not only in Nova Scotia but in the specific site they chose.\"\n\nAward, para. 447.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 470. It should be noted that provincial officials made no assurances about the particular treatment that the Claimant would receive in the environmental process, nor did the Claimant ever assert that they did.\n\n5.\n\nWith respect, the actions of Nova Scotia officials in encouraging investment in mining and any consequent \"legitimate expectations\" are simply irrelevant to whether the JRP has met the standards of Article 1105. Any investor would have the expectation that if the requirements of Canadian law (federal and provincial) regarding environmental assessment were met its investment could go ahead. Assurances or encouragement by provincial officials have nothing to do with the expectation that an investor will have Canadian law applied properly to it. That is an expectation that an investor would have independently of any assurances or encouragement. Thus, the long excursus by the majority into the actions of provincial officials,10 apart from creating an aura of mistreatment of the Claimant, simply has no bearing on the alleged violation of Article 1105.\n\nAward, paras. 455-470.\n\n6.\n\nThe majority also adds to this aura of mistreatment by reference to what happened at the hearing and other conclusions and recommendations set out in the Panel report, even though it does not conclude that anything in the JRP process constitutes a violation of Article 1105. It refers to a failure to call Bilcon\u2019s expert witnesses, the recommendations about a moratorium on future coastal projects, and the demeanour of the President in the hearing. Yet, in doing so, the majority has relied on what the Claimant\u2019s experts and witnesses claimed, rather than what actually was said in the hearing itself.\n\n7.\n\nThis is well illustrated by the majority\u2019s reference to the witness statement of Bilcon\u2019s consultant, Mr. Hugh Fraser who said that the JRP paid \"little respect to Bilcon and its experts.\"11 He uses as an example of a lack of respect a question of the President of the JRP, Dr. Fournier, asking if any of Bilcon\u2019s team knew what the scientific method was, and this, Mr. Fraser said, was a to a team composed of \"experienced and qualified engineers and scientists\". But reference to the actual transcript of the hearing shows that Mr. Fraser omitted the fact that Dr. Fournier had already put the question to two of Bilcon\u2019s experts and they had been unable to answer it.12 This of course places the question put by Dr. Fournier in a totally different light.\n\nHugh Fraser Witness Statement, p. 5, para. 13.\n\nJRP Hearing Transcript, 18 June 2007, pp. 261-263.\n\n8.\n\nFor the majority, the central failing of the JRP was to rely on the concept of \"community core values\" which it says became the essential basis of its reasoning to recommend rejection of the Project. It was, in the words of the majority, the \"decisive and overriding consideration\".13 The term, the majority says, was \"fundamentally novel\",14 essentially unknown to environmental assessment.15 It had not been used in the environmental assessment guidelines for the JRP, the majority says, and the Claimant was never made aware that its Project was to be assessed against it.16\n\nAward, para. 452.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 573.\n\nThis is a rather odd claim, as the majority also says that the Claimant\u2019s expert Mr. Estrin stated that in the Sable Gas case \"community core values\" was addressed in a particular way. *Ibid,* para. 493.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 451.\n\n9.\n\nThe majority argues that the meaning of \"community core values\" is difficult to ascertain and \"open to a variety of possible interpretations\". It then divines four possible interpretations of \"community core values\" intended by the JRP and proceeds to explain why these are all legally and factually unsustainable.17\n\nIt should be noted that none of these meanings of \"community core values\" was proposed by either party in its written or oral pleadings before the Tribunal, or identified as the meaning of community core values by the JRP.\n\n10.\n\nThe first of these possible interpretations is that the concept of community core values is shorthand for majority public opinion. In supporting this potential linkage, the majority refers to nothing in the JRP report but to a question put by the Chair of the JRP to a witness during the public hearing, asking, \"in some small way this is a kind of referendum, isn\u2019t it?\"18 The question was never answered and the idea of a referendum appears nowhere else in the transcript of the hearing or in the JRP Report. In short, the majority here is simply erecting a \"straw man\".\n\nHearing Transcript, Volume 11, p. 2669.\n\n11.\n\nThe second potential meaning of community core values, identified by the majority, are values enshrined in certain key documents including \"Vision 2000\". This is a plausible description of what the JRP took into account in considering the importance of core values in the community.19 But as a sole description of the meaning of community core values, it is partial and does not, as I shall point out shortly, do justice to what the JRP actually said.\n\n*See,* JRP Report, p. 99, Exhibit C-34.\n\n12.\n\nThe third potential meaning of community core values, according to the majority, is local self-determination in planning matters. Once again the majority has taken a part of what the JRP said and criticized it, as if it were the whole. Local self-determination is mentioned by the JRP in elaborating what \"community core values\" can encompass,20 but there is no basis for concluding that this alone is what the JRP meant by the concept of community core values.\n\nJRP Report, p. 99.\n\n13.\n\nThe fourth meaning of community core values identified by the majority is \"community DNA\". The majority derives this meaning from what the JRP described as a \"biological analogy\" drawn by the JRP to provide \"a perspective on the potential impact on the proposed quarry and marine terminal on the communities of Digby Neck and Islands\". The analogy is described by the JRP itself as \"not perfect\",21 and at a certain point, the Panel admits that the analogy breaks down.22 The analogy may perhaps have been more meaningful to the scientists on the panel than to lawyers and it was offered purely on the basis that readers might find it helpful. There is nothing, however, in the report itself to suggest that the JRP saw \"community DNA\" as the primary way to view \"community core values\". The whole analogy was placed in a square box, as an aside, implying it was there for those who found it useful, but was not the basis on which the analysis of the JRP rested.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 100.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n14.\n\nThe majority has selected individual elements from the hearing or from the JRP report and suggested that they are potential interpretations of the concept of \"community core values\". In short, it has simply speculated on what the JRP might have meant by the term \"community core values\". What the majority has failed to do is to look at the JRP report itself and see how the concepts of \"core values\" and \"community core values\" arose and what were their referents. If this had been done it would have been seen that \"core values\" and \"community core values\" were simply names given to an important component of what the JRP in accordance with its terms of reference had to consider.\n\n**Community Core Values in the JRP Report**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Panel saw its mandate in the following terms: \"to identify, evaluate and report on the potential environmental effects of the Project on the physical, biological and human environments.\"23 It also stated that its report \"should include recommendations about either the approval, including mitigation measures, or the rejection of the Project.\"24 In undertaking its \"Environmental Effects Assessment\" the Panel covered \"terrestrial effects\", \"marine effects\", \"human environment effects\" and \"cumulative effects\".25 In each case the Panel reviewed the nature of the potential effects and how the Claimant had dealt with them in its Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and considered the adequacy of any mitigation measures proposed by the Claimant.\n\nJRP Report, p. 15.\n\n*Ibid.* The detailed terms of reference are set out in the Agreement of the Canadian Minister of the Environment and the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour on \"The Establishment of a Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal\", Exhibit R-27.\n\nJRP Report, pp. 66-84.\n\n16.\n\nIn making its assessment of the human environment effects, the Panel stated that the communities of Digby Neck and Islands have developed \"core values that reflect their sense of place, their desire for self-reliance, and the need to respect and sustain their surrounding environment.\"26 This appears to be the first reference to \"core values\" in the JRP report. Throughout its analysis of the human environment effects, the Panel points out that the Proponent27 had failed to provide an adequate analysis of such matters as Aboriginal peoples resource use,28 community history and heritage resources,29 community character and attitudes,30 and community health and wellness.31\n\n*Ibid,* p. 66\n\nSince the JRP refers to the Claimant as the Proponent in its Report, the two terms will be used here interchangeably.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 67. The Panel noted that the Proponent\u2019s attempts to consult with Aboriginal communities was unsuccessful and as a result traditional Aboriginal knowledge was left out of its assessment.\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 68-69. The Panel found the Proponent\u2019s archeological assessment inadequate, in part because it was undertaken after quarrying operations had taken place and disturbed the area, and lacked reference to traditional community knowledge.\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 69-72. The Panel considered that the EIS had failed to appreciate the strong commitment of the community through its organizations and community groups to sustainable development and may have exacerbated a \"them and us\" attitude. The Proponent had been unsuccessful in engaging in meaningful consultation with the community and was perceived by some in the community as having a dismissive or hostile response to their concerns.\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 72-79. In the Panel\u2019s view the EIS provided \"little socio-cultural information, such as patterns of family or community life\". Equally it provided little information on air quality, or noise, vibration, light and traffic, or inadequate information on the effect of the project on water wells and mitigation measure.\n\n17.\n\nThe inability of the Proponent to provide an adequate assessment of the human environment effects of the Project was perceived by the Panel in large part as a result of the failure of the Proponent to engage effectively in consultations with Aboriginal peoples, with fishers and with others in the community. The Proponent had established a Community Liaison Committee (CLC) chaired by a person from the community, but over time, only supporters of the Project attended.32 Some concluded that the Committee was just a vehicle for the Proponent to promote its Project and the Panel concluded that the Committee had \"mixed success\" in encouraging \"open exchanges on the issues in an unthreatening environment.\"33\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 69-72. The Panel considered that the EIS had failed to appreciate the strong commitment of the community through its organizations and community groups to sustainable development and may have exacerbated a \"them and us\" attitude. The Proponent had been unsuccessful in engaging in meaningful consultation with the community and was perceived by some in the community as having a dismissive or hostile response to their concerns.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 71.\n\n18.\n\nAn illustration of the difficulty community members found with the Community Liaison Committee is illustrated by an assertion made by the Proponent in a meeting on November 24, 2003 that the JRP could only recommend modifications to the Project; it could not prevent the Project from going ahead.34 In other words, the Proponent was saying, the project was going to go ahead regardless and attempts to prevent that were futile. This was hardly a basis on which an effective community consultation could be conducted. The JRP also considered that a defamation suit brought by the Proponent at an early stage against a local newspaper that had made negative comments about Bilcon \"undermined the willingness of local residents to enter into meaningful discussions with the Proponent and hardened local attitudes against the project.\"35\n\nCLC Minutes, 24 November 2003, p. 234, Exhibit R-299. \"Mr. Buxton noted that this project is a legal project and there is nothing in law to prevent this project from going ahead. He noted that there are hoops to jump through....\"\n\nJRP Report, p. 71.\n\n19.\n\nThe Panel\u2019s assessment of the effects of the human environment is an assessment in part of the so-called \"core values\" that ultimately became the basis for the Panel\u2019s recommendation that the project be rejected. The Panel said that the five elected officials, who had appeared before it, \"argued that approval would be inconsistent with community values and local initiatives\".36 This is a clear indication that the Panel understood community core values to be the substance of what was being said in submissions and at the hearing about the human environment. So, if there were any uncertainty about what the Panel meant by community values, core values or community core values, one can simply have reference to what those five elected officials were saying in the hearing.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 71\n\n20.\n\nThe officials did not use the terms community values, or core values; they spoke of fishing, of tourism, of air and water quality and generally about the quality of life in the Digby Neck and Islands area. They were concerned with the socio-economic effects of the project on their communities.37 Thus, when the Panel said that these witnesses were talking about community values, in the eyes of the Panel the concept of community values was an encapsulation of the matters discussed by it in the human environment effects assessment.\n\nJRP Hearing Transcript Vol. 8.\n\n21.\n\nThe Panel noted that the Proponent did not \"acknowledge community core values as defining features of these communities\".38 The Proponent\u2019s view appeared to be that this was a community in decline and that the economic opportunities provided by the project would help arrest that decline. However, the Panel saw several instances where the communities had discussed and set out in documents their vision of the community that encourages economic development, but provides a balanced approach combining economic, social and cultural issues. In the words of the Panel, \"they simultaneously advocate core values, quality of life and a sustainable environmental outcome\".39 A Proponent putting together an EIS for the project that provided a human environment effects assessment, would have undoubtedly been aware of these documents and the fact that some of them refer to the notions of \"local values\" and \"community values\".40\n\nJRP Report, p. 93.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 94.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n22.\n\nThis failure of the Proponent to consider the way in which the relevant communities have given consideration to community planning activities and policy outcomes, such as commonly identified priorities, core values, vision statements or future goals was regarded as a serious deficiency in the EIS. Indeed, in the Panel\u2019s view, such core values were to be regarded as a \"Valued Environmental Component as important to the broad ecosystem as any other part of the ecosystem\". This led to the Panel\u2019s key conclusion:41\n\nthe implementation of the proposed White\u2019s Point Quarry and Maine Terminal complex would introduce a significant and dramatic change to Digby Neck and Islands, resulting in sufficiently important changes to that community\u2019s core values that warrant the Panel describing them collectively as a Significant Adverse Environment Effect that cannot be mitigated.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 100.\n\n23.\n\nThus, the \"core values\" of the Digby Neck and Islands communities or the \"community core values\" revolved around the matters discussed in the human environment effects assessment made by the Panel. That assessment concerned the historical use of the area by Aboriginal peoples, fishing, eco-tourism, quality of life, air and water quality, a sense of community history and heritage, a belief in a certain community character and common attitudes, and were reflected, too, in views about the health of the community. And these views, the JRP considered, were reflected and developed through the various documents that were identified by the Panel.\n\n24.\n\nNone of these documents reflected formal community planning, nor did they constitute the views of the whole community. In the view of the Panel, the documents demonstrated an attempt to define what was important to the community and the same views emerged in many of the statements made by members of the public and NGOs at the hearing. The Panel obviously gave great credence to these manifestations of community values and the effect that the Project would have on the people in the community, their economy and values.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant asserted that the concept of community core values was completely new. The Claimant alleged that it had not been made aware that that it was a matter to be addressed before the JRP, let alone that the JRP\u2019s decision would be based on this concept. But when the JRP referred to \"community core values\", it was referring to precisely the matters relating to the human environment that according to the Panel had been dealt with so inadequately by the Proponent in its EIS. The Claimant knew that the EIS had to cover what the Panel saw as encompassed within community core values -aboriginal resource use, community history and heritage, community character and attitudes etc - and it heard what community members had to say at the hearing. But the Proponent failed to make connections with Aboriginal peoples, with fishers, and with other community members that might have allowed it to provide what was requested of it. And it did not attempt to respond in the hearing to the many views expressed on the effect of the project on the community of Digby Neck and Islands.\n\n26.\n\nRather than being unaware of what was required of a human environment effects analysis, what the Panel was to call \"community core values\", the Claimant simply did not or was unable to satisfy the Panel that the project could operate consistently with those core values. The Panel was entitled to make that assessment; it was clearly within its mandate to do so.\n\n27.\n\nThe majority treats the decision of the JRP as if it were in effect a \"zoning decision\".42 But, the JRP simply made its recommendation about the specific project before it. If the Proponent had been successful both in community consultations and in its EIS in assuaging the concerns of the community and the JRP about the socio-economic impact of the Project on the community, perhaps in modifying its proposal, perhaps in providing greater economic benefits, the recommendation might have been different. It is true that the JRP did make a recommendation in its report that Nova Scotia develop a coastal zone management policy and place a moratorium on future development until that had occurred. But this was a reflection of what it considered to be appropriate after going through the review process and can hardly be referred to as a surreptitious zoning decision by the JRP in its primary recommendation that the Project be rejected. In seeing the recommendation of the JRP as a \"kind of zoning decision\", the majority is relying on speculation about motives rather than looking at what the JRP actually said.\n\nAward, para. 454.\n\n**The Identification of Mitigation Measures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOnce the Panel made the determination that it should recommend the rejection of the project because it was inconsistent with human environment concerns and the attitudes of the community to those concerns, the question was whether it was required to identify mitigation measures to deal with those community concerns. The Panel took the view that it was not required to do so. In making its criticism of this conclusion, the majority refers to the words of the Panel that, it \u2019\u2019accepts that with the effective application of appropriate mitigation measures, competent project management and appropriate regulatory oversight, most project effects should not be regarded as \u2018significant\u2019,\" suggesting that the Panel\u2019s concerns could have easily been dealt with through mitigation measures. However, the words immediately following the above quotation state that the \"accumulation of concerns about adequacy leads the Panel to question the Project\".43\n\nJRP Report, pp. 83-84.\n\n29.\n\nIn short, the Panel took the view that while individual objections in isolation might be met by appropriate mitigation measures, the Panel was concerned with the effects of the project on the human environment as a whole - what it encapsulated in the term \"community core values\". Focusing on individual concerns within that panoply of human environment issues and questions did not, in the Panel\u2019s view, get to the central issue about the effect of the project as a whole. In the Panel\u2019s view, pointing out possible individual mitigation measures served no value when its concerns were much larger. This \"accumulation of concerns\" ultimately led the Panel to recommend the rejection of the project.\n\n30.\n\nThere is, of course, a question under Canadian law whether it was proper for the JRP to take such an approach to mitigation measures. And, there may well be a question whether using a term such as \"community core values\" to encapsulate the variety of human environment effects that the Proponent had failed to address adequately and that ultimately led to the recommendation to reject the Project, accords with the requirements of Canadian law. The majority quotes extensively from the expert opinions of Mr. David Estrin and Professor Murray Rankin, two highly respected Canadian environmental lawyers. Both took the view that Canadian environmental law had not been complied with by the JRP and that its decision would have been overturned if it had been taken to a Canadian federal court on judicial review.\n\n31.\n\nHowever, neither Mr. Estrin, nor Professor Rankin, is an expert on NAFTA, nor did either seek to give an opinion on whether the actions of the JRP constituted a violation of Article 1105. But that is the issue that this Tribunal had to decide. And whether Canadian law has been complied with is a relevant consideration in deciding whether there has been a violation of NAFTA Article 1105, it is not of itself sufficient to establish such a violation.44\n\n*GAMI, supra,* footnote 6.\n\n**The Applicable Standard under NAFTA Article 1105**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nI am in agreement with the majority45 that the appropriate standard to apply in the application of Article 1105 is that set out in *Waste Management.* There it was said:\n\nthe minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.46\n\nI am in agreement with the majority, too, that this is a high standard, but one that is not to be applied rigidly. There is some flexibility in its application and it must be applied in light of the facts in each particular case.\n\nAward, paras. 427 and 443.\n\n*Waste Management, supra,* footnote 2.\n\n33.\n\nThe majority\u2019s assessment of whether the *Waste Management* standard has been met relies first on frustration of the \"legitimate expectations\" of the Claimant created by the actions of officials of the governments of Nova Scotia that Canadian law would be properly applied. As pointed out earlier, the actions of Nova Scotia officials are irrelevant here because the expectation that Canadian law would be properly applied to it is an expectation that any investor would legitimately have, even in the absence of any assurances or encouragement. Thus, the \"legitimate expectations\" that the majority identifies are simply of no assistance in deciding whether there has been a violation of Article 1105.\n\n34.\n\nThe majority then argues that the actions of the JRP meet the *Waste Management* standard because they were arbitrary in that the JRP had created and applied a \" new standard of assessment, rather than fully carrying out the mandate defined by the applicable law\".47 This, then, is an allegation that the JRP did not comply with Canadian law. In this regard, the majority accepts the view of the Claimant\u2019s experts that Canadian law had not been complied with and rejects the view of the Respondent\u2019s expert that the JRP\u2019s approach was consistent with Canadian law. At the very least then, the matter was arguable and the Tribunal did not have the benefit of a determination by a Canadian federal court on the matter. At most, then, the majority is saying that there has been a violation of Article 1105 because of a potential violation of Canadian law by the JRP, and that adopting an approach that led to that potential violation was action that was arbitrary.\n\nAward, para. 591.\n\n35.\n\nThe majority, however, argues that this potential violation of Canadian law nonetheless meets the high threshold of the *Waste Management* standard. Again the majority reverts to the expectations of the Claimant, the lack of reasonable notice of the new approach and a reiteration of the language that the JRP \"had departed in fundamental ways from the standard of evaluation provided by the laws of Canada.\"48\n\n*Ibid,* para. 594.\n\n36.\n\nWith respect, none of this demonstrates anything more than that potentially the JRP approach would have been found by a federal court not to be in conformity with Canadian law. As I have pointed out, the Claimant\u2019s only legitimate expectation could have been that Canadian law would be properly applied and the majority takes the view that Canadian law had not been properly applied. But, a potential breach of Canadian law does not meet the high threshold of the *Waste Management* standard.\n\n37.\n\nThus, the only  basis for meeting the high threshold of Article 1005 is the assertion that the JRP\u2019s conduct was arbitrary. But here, with respect, I find the majority\u2019s reasoning somewhat circular. The majority concludes that the Panel actions were arbitrary. But the manifest arbitrariness seems to be that instead of applying Canadian law, the Panel \"effectively created, without legal authority or notice to Bilcon, a new standard of assessment\".49 In short, by deviating from Canadian law, the Panel acted arbitrarily. This reasoning suggests that any departure from Canadian law is arbitrary and thus any departure from Canadian law meets the threshold of arbitrariness under the *Waste Management* standard. Breach of NAFTA Article 1105, then is equated with a breach of Canadian law.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n38.\n\nThe majority makes no attempt, beyond an assertion of arbitrariness, to show how the actions of the JRP were, in fact, arbitrary. There is no suggestion that the Panel had deliberately or willfully disregarded the law to be applied. Indeed, the Panel thought that what it was doing was justified and within the law. The majority refers to a subsequent interview with the Chair of the JRP, who admitted that not listing mitigation measures was novel. But the Chair then went on to reiterate the justification given in the JRP\u2019s report for doing so.50 The Panel had taken the view that the problems with the project were such that mitigation measures could not save it. This was a principled position, and even if it turned out not to be supportable under Canadian law, the position can hardly be regarded as arbitrary within the meaning of the *Waste Management* standard.\n\nExhibit C-180.\n\n39.\n\nThe majority also claims that the actions of the Nova Scotia officials were unjust in encouraging investment by Bilcon,51 implying, it appears, that this was an alternative basis for finding that the *Waste Management* principle had been complied with. But, as pointed out, the expectations resulting from the actions of Novas Scotia officials could do no more than create an expectation the Bilcon would be treated in accordance with Canadian law. And, as pointed out already failure to treat someone in accordance with Canadian law does not of itself constitute a breach of Article 1105.\n\nAward, para. 592.\n\n40.\n\nIn short, the most the majority has shown is that there is a possibility that the JRP\u2019s analysis did not conform to the requirements of Canadian law and would have been overturned had it been subjected to judicial review by a Canadian federal court. I cannot agree that this meets the threshold set out in the *Waste Management* case. The actions of the JRP have not been shown to be arbitrary, nor has the majority shown that other *Waste Management* standards are met. The conduct of the JRP cannot be viewed as \"grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic,\" or that it \"involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\" It has simply been alleged the JRP applied a standard that is not in conformity with Canadian law. Thus, I do not believe that the JRP\u2019s actions constitute a violation of NAFTA Article 1105.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant was no doubt upset and disappointed with the result of the review process in which it has invested considerable human and financial resources. But there was never any guarantee that it would pass the review process and disappointment is not a basis for finding a violation of Article 1105. As the tribunal in *Robert Azinian et al* v. *The United Mexican States* famously said:52\n\nIt is a fact of life everywhere that individuals may be disappointed in their dealings with public authorities, and disappointed yet again when national courts reject their complaints...NAFTA was not intended to provide foreign investors with blanket protection from this kind of disappointment, and nothing in its terms so provides.\n\n*Robert Azinian et al v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, para. 83.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants did, of course, have an available recourse to deal with their disappointment with the report of the JRP. They could have taken the matter to the Federal Court of Canada, which could have reviewed the decision and perhaps overturned it. But, they chose not to do so and ultimately filed this NAFTA claim. Of course, they were entitled to choose a remedy through NAFTA rather than pursuing a domestic remedy under Canadian law.53 But the NAFTA standard is not the domestic law standard and a NAFTA claim must meet the NAFTA standard. Showing that domestic law could have been violated does not mean that there has been a violation of Article 1105.\n\nNAFTA Article 1121.\n\n43.\n\nBy treating this potential violation of Canadian law as itself a violation of NAFTA Article 1105 the majority has in effect introduced the potential for getting damages for what it is breach of Canadian law, where Canadian law does not provide a damages claim for such a breach. That is not what NAFTA was intended to do. You cannot get a remedy under NAFTA Chapter 11 for breach of Canadian law; you can only get a NAFTA remedy for a breach of NAFTA.\n\n**Implications of the Decision**\n--------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe majority takes great pains to deny that its decision interferes with Canada\u2019s ability to legislate on environmental issues.54 And, the case of course does not challenge Canada\u2019s laws; rather, it challenges the way they have been implemented. But there are two consequences of the majority\u2019s decision that have significant implications for the application of environmental laws by NAFTA Parties.\n\nAward, para. 598.\n\n45.\n\nFirst, by concluding that a potential violation of Canadian law, caused by the use of novel language by a Panel, even though it did all that was required of it in providing an environmental assessment, or caused by a failure to list at the end of its report possible mitigation measures that it had referred to throughout its report, meets the *Waste* *Management* standard and thus constitutes a violation of NAFTA Article 1105, will change the character of environmental review under a joint review panel and perhaps other forms of environmental review as well.\n\n46.\n\nA joint review panel is generally made up of scientists and environmental experts and not necessarily lawyers. It may use language that best expresses the views and conclusions it has reached, which may not be language familiar to lawyers and may not be the same as the language used by another joint review panel, expressing similar ideas. The real question is not what language has been used, but whether the Panel has done, in substance, what it has been asked to do.\n\n47.\n\nThere are two controls on an environmental review panel in the Canadian system. First, if the government does not consider that the Panel has done its job properly, it can reject the recommendation of the Panel. Second, a party that considers that the Panel has not acted in accordance with Canadian law can ask for the Federal Court of Canada to review the actions of the Panel. Neither event occurred in this case.\n\n48.\n\nWhat the majority has done is add a further control over environmental review panels. Failure to comply with Canadian law by a review panel now becomes the basis for a NAFTA claim allowing a claimant to bypass the domestic remedy provided for such a departure from Canadian law. This is a significant intrusion into domestic jurisdiction and will create a chill on the operation of environmental review panels. In the past, if they made an error - exceeded their jurisdiction or failed to comply with the law - they would have had their recommendations ignored by the governments to which they were made or overturned on review by a federal court. If the majority view in this case is to be accepted, then the proper application of Canadian law by an environmental review panel will be in the hands of a NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal, importing a damages remedy that is not available under Canadian law.\n\n49.\n\nSecond, and more troubling for the ability of a state to apply its environmental law, is that the result of the majority decision is that a review panel that put great weight on the effect of a project on the human environment and took account of the community\u2019s own expression of its interests and values results in the state being liable in damages to an investor. Thus, subjugation of human environment concerns to the scientific and technical feasibility of a project is not only an intrusion into the way an environmental review process is to be conducted, but also an intrusion into the environmental public policy of the state.\n\n50.\n\nIn effect, what occurred in this case was that an environmental review panel concluded that the socio-economic effects of a project were sufficiently negative that notwithstanding the existence of some positive benefits of the project, it should recommend against the project. In doing so, the Panel used terminology with which the Claimant argued it was not familiar to describe established and well-understood socio-economic and environmental effects. The Panel also decided not to recommend mitigation measures, because it believed that the overall effect of the project could not be mitigated. On that basis, the majority has concluded that Canada is liable in damages under NAFTA.\n\n51.\n\nThis result may be disturbing to many. In this day and age, the idea of an environmental review panel putting more weight on the human environment and on community values than on scientific and technical feasibility, and concluding that these community values were not outweighed by what the panel regarded as modest economic benefits over 50 years, does not appear at all unusual. Neither such a result nor the process by which it was reached in this case could ever be said to \"offend judicial propriety\".55 Once again, a chill will be imposed on environmental review panels which will be concerned not to give too much weight to socio-economic considerations or other considerations of the human environment in case the result is a claim for damages under NAFTA Chapter 11. In this respect, the decision of the majority will be seen as a remarkable step backwards in environmental protection.\n\n*Waste Management, supra,* footnote 2, para. 95.\n\n52.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with my colleagues\u2019 disposition of the claim under Article 1105. I would have found that there was no breach of Article 1105.\n\n53.\n\nI equally find that the actions of the JRP could not constitute a violation of Articles 1102 and 1103. In my view, the Claimants were treated in accordance with Canadian law, which all investors are entitled to expect, and thus there is no basis for a claim that there has been a violation of obligations of national treatment or of mostfavoured-nation treatment.\n\n54.\n\nIn all other matters I agree with the results reached by my colleagues and thus have nothing further to add."}], "Content": "Award on Jurisdiction and Liability\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **G** **LOSSARY OF**  **D** **EFINED**  **T** **ERMS** |\n| ANFO | Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil |\n| Bilcon | Bilcon of Nova Scotia, a limited liability company incorporated on 24 April 2002 in Nova Scotia and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bilcon of Delaware |\n| Blasting Conditions | Blasting conditions added to the Approval dated 30 April 2002 by the Province of Nova Scotia \"for the construction and operation of a Quarry, at or near Little River, Digby County in the Province of Nova Scotia\" pursuant to Part V of the Nova Scotia Environment Act |\n| Blasting Guidelines | Guidelines for the Use of Explosives In or Near Canadian Fisheries Waters, Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 2107 by D.G.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Investors acting as claimants in the present arbitration are Messrs. William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton and Daniel Clayton, all nationals of the United States of America, as well as Bilcon of Delaware, Inc., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Investors' addresses for service are as follows:\n\nMr. William Ralph Clayton Bilcon of Delaware, Inc.\n\nMr. William Richard Clayton 1355 Campus Parkway\n\nMr. Douglas Clayton Monmouth Shores Corporate Park\n\nMr. Daniel Clayton Neptune, NJ 07753\n\nPO Box 3015 United States of America\n\nLakewood, NJ 08701\n\nUnited States of America\n\n2.\n\nThe Investors are represented in these proceedings by Mr. Barry Appleton of Appleton & Associates, 77 Bloor Street West, Suite 1800, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 1M2, Canada.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent in the present arbitration is the Government of Canada. Its address for service is Trade Law Bureau (JLT), Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, 125 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0G2, Canada.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in these proceedings by the following counsel at the Trade Law Bureau:\n\nMs. Sylvie Tabet Mr. Scott Little Mr. Shane Spelliscy Mr. Reuben East Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9bert\n\n5.\n\nThe Parties'1 dispute revolves around the Investors' proposal to operate a quarry and a marine terminal2 in Nova Scotia at Whites Point in Digby Neck (\"Whites Point project\"). Beginning in 2002, the Whites Point project underwent a lengthy environmental assessment (\"EA\") by Nova Scotia and the Canadian Federal Government. Both governments rejected the project on environmental grounds in line with the recommendations of a Joint Review Panel (\"JRP\") at the end of 2007. The Parties differ starkly as to the appropriateness of various aspects of the EA and the treatment that the Investors received during this process. While the Investors contend that the treatment they received at every stage of the EA was unfair, politically biased and discriminatory, the Respondent maintains that the relevant authorities dealt with the proposal fairly and professionally. In the Respondent's view, it was the Investors who acted unprofessionally at various stages of the EA.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the use of the phrase \"disputing parties\" within the text of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, as defined in Article 1139, in distinction to the NAFTA contracting \"Parties\". In the interest of better readability, the Tribunal will reserve the terms \"Party\" and \"Parties\" in this Award to designate the parties to the present arbitral proceedings.\n\nAlthough the Investors also refer to the marine-based construction as \"marine terminal\" in their Reply (*e.g.*, Reply, paras. 59, 62, 64), in their Memorial, they use the term \"dock\" and emphasize that \"it was not a \u2018marine terminal' at all within the meaning of the *CEAA*, Canada's federal environmental authority\" (Memorial, para. 487, referring to First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 164). Without prejudice to the Investors' position on the qualification of marine terminal for the purposes of the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act* (\" *CEAA* \") and for the decision to scope the quarry and the marine terminal in the federal EA, the Tribunal will use the term \"marine terminal\".\n\n**B. THE ESSENCE OF THE INVESTORS' CASE**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Investor's position is essentially as follows.\n\n7.\n\nThe Clayton Group of Companies, founded over fifty years ago, are principally engaged in supplying building materials, including concrete. The Clayton Group was managed by Mr. William Ralph Clayton, and his three sons, Mr. William Richard Clayton, Mr. Douglas Clayton and Mr. Daniel Clayton were also involved in the corporate operations. In 2008 the senior Mr. Clayton reduced his workload and transferred his interest in the Clayton Group to his sons. The Clayton Group requires a substantial, secure and economical supply of aggregate for its projects. The Clayton Group has a long history of providing needed products in a lawful manner. Its activities help to supply the roads, bridges and buildings needed by both the public and private sectors.3 The Clayton Group has been recognized for its leadership in corporate social responsibility, especially in the areas of health and education.4\n\nMemorial, paras. 32-42; Witness Statement of William Richard Clayton, paras. 1-3.\n\nMemorial, para. 33 (full details of the corporate family's official awards and honours provided in a lengthy footnote).\n\n8.\n\nAs will be described later in detail, Bilcon of Delaware, Inc., is a member of the Clayton Group and was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2002. The shareholders are the Clayton brothers. In the same year, Bilcon of Delaware, Inc., in turn incorporated as a subsidiary a new Nova Scotia company, Bilcon of Nova Scotia (\"Bilcon\"), to operate the Whites Point project, the purpose of which was to provide a reliable supply of aggregate for Bilcon of Delaware and the Clayton Group of Companies. Bilcon entered into a partnership with a Nova Scotia company, Nova Stone Exporters, Inc. (\"Nova Stone\"), to develop a quarry and marine terminal at Whites Point Quarry. The partnership was acquired entirely by Bilcon in 2004.\n\n9.\n\nFor the purposes of its Chapter Eleven claims, the Investors are defined as Bilcon of Delaware and four individual investors, Messrs. William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton and Daniel Clayton. The Investors define their Investment as including Bilcon of Nova Scotia and the tangible and intangible property of the Investors associated with the Whites Point project.5\n\nMemorial, para. 43.\n\n10.\n\nBilcon submits that the Province of Nova Scotia had a publicly stated policy of encouraging investment in its mining industry. Its political and technical officials were informed of the interest by Bilcon in developing a mining quarry and marine terminal at Whites Point, in Digby County, Nova Scotia. They welcomed Bilcon's interest and provided political and technical support. The overall regulatory framework in place in Nova Scotia and federal Canada includes requirements for environmental assessment and approval. Both jurisdictions have legislated policies of \"sustainable development\". The core of this philosophy is to encourage and promote economic development while conserving and promoting environmental quality.6 Bilcon was from the outset committed to complying with the environmental processes and standards of both federal Canada and Nova Scotia. It expected that it could address all relevant concerns about potential adverse effects by consulting with the community, assembling expert evidence on physical, biological and social impacts, and putting in place appropriate plans to prevent and mitigate environmental harm. It was interested in sound environmental practices as a matter of its own sense of corporate social responsibility.\n\n*CEAA*, preamble.\n\n11.\n\nBilcon contends, however, that its legitimate expectations, created by the regulatory framework and specific expressions of encouragement by governments, were frustrated unfairly and in breach of the safeguard that Chapter Eleven of NAFTA provides for investors and investments concerning non-discrimination (Articles 1102 and 1103) and fair treatment (Article 1105).\n\n12.\n\nIn 2001, the Investors began to consider a project at Whites Point, in Digby County, Nova Scotia. Nova Stone applied to Nova Scotia environmental regulators for approval of a 3.9 hectare (\"ha\") quarry at that location. Nova Scotia regulators recommended approval. Shortly thereafter, Bilcon entered into a partnership agreement with Nova Stone to develop and operate the Whites Point Quarry. Nova Stone's original application, however, was sent back as it turned out to actually exceed 4.0 ha.\n\n13.\n\nNova Stone revised the application to meet the 3.9 ha ceiling, and attempted to obtain industrial approvals to operate a small quarry on the site of the eventual project. It wanted to conduct test blasts. The results would assist in planning the project and making the case to regulators and the public that the quarry would be safe for the environment. Even though a small land-based quarry is ordinarily within provincial jurisdiction, Nova Scotia regulators stipulated, unlawfully, contends Bilcon, that blasting could only be carried out in accordance with federal Canada's guidelines on marine blasting.\n\n14.\n\nApproval to conduct the test blast, however, was never obtained. First, federal Canada's officials wrongly stated that Bilcon needed to conduct the blasts as far as 500 metres from the shore. The officials later realized that this was a mistake and the blasting guidelines only required a 100 metre setback but, they delayed disclosing the truth to Bilcon. The key federal Canada official with respect to marine mammals, Mr. Jerry Conway, informed his colleagues that he had \"no concerns\" about the impact of blasting if care was taken to avoid blasting if whales were sighted within a kilometre from the test site. Again, disclosure of this fact to Bilcon was long delayed. Bilcon tried for several more years to obtain the cooperation of regulatory authorities to conduct test blasts, but eventually gave up. Concerns over the environmental impact of blasting, however, ended up being cited by the JRP that recommended against the project.\n\n15.\n\nBilcon submits that behind the scenes there was inappropriate political interference in the regulatory process. The Federal Minister of Fisheries was also the Member of Parliament representing the local area in which the project was located. He was aware that some constituents strongly opposed the idea of a quarry and marine terminal project. He would eventually, at the JRP, argue against its proceeding. One senior federal Canada official noted \"[The Minister] wants process dragged out as long as possible\".7 Aware of the Minister's desire, officials recommended that the project be subjected to a JRP. This process is the most rigorous, protracted and expensive kind of review. It involves public hearings and a report by an independent panel.\n\nJournal note by Bruce Hood, undated, p. 801619, Exhibit C-370.\n\n16.\n\nAccording to Bilcon, JRPs were never used except with respect to projects of far greater risk or magnitude. Referring the Bilcon project to such a panel was in stark contrast to another project on the Digby Neck Peninsula, the Tiverton Quarry. The Minister supported that project, which was locally owned. Approval was promptly granted with respect to test blasting in that case, even though it involved carrying out explosions in the ocean rather than in a land area set back from the shore. The environmental assessment process used for the Tiverton project was a mere screening rather than a JRP.\n\n17.\n\nBilcon argues that federal Canada officials knew full well that the referral to a JRP was unwarranted. Federal officials believed that the scope of any federal environmental assessment should be confined to the marine terminal, not the quarry.8 They were aware of court cases that had taught that environmental assessments by a provincial or federal government should not encroach on the authority of the other level of government. Under the federal laws of the time, federal Canada officials were also aware, contends Bilcon, that there was no basis to believe that any projected activities at the quarry triggered an environmental assessment under the *CEAA*. There was no reasonable basis to be concerned that blasting or other land activities would damage fish habitat or endanger marine mammals.\n\nE-mail from Bruce Hood to Reg Sweeney, dated 9 December 2003, Exhibit C-62.\n\n18.\n\nOnce the matter was referred to a JRP, Bilcon exercised every reasonable effort to address the issues identified by federal Canada's and Nova Scotia's environmental assessment laws and that were specifically mentioned in the Terms of Reference for the JRP. In 2006 Bilcon filed an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") of over 3,000 pages, comprising 17 volumes. It was the product of millions of dollars of work involving thirty-five experts.9 It attempted to address physical, biological and social impacts of the project. Bilcon responded to numerous requests from the JRP for additional information.\n\nMemorial, para. 472, citing Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 70.\n\n19.\n\nThe hearing itself, however, did not afford Bilcon a reasonable opportunity to present its case. Over the course of ninety hours of hearings, Bilcon's experts testified for only about ninety minutes. Instead, the Panel permitted the hearing to become a forum for the expression of antiAmerican venting by a variety of citizens, representatives of organizations, and politicians\u2014 including former Minister of Fisheries Mr. Robert Thibault. The Panel did not act to limit or criticize condemnations that were grounded in nationality-based bias and lacking in scientific merit, but instead at times displayed its own scolding and disrespectful tone.10\n\nWitness Statement of Hugh Fraser, para. 13.\n\n20.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Chair of the JRP at one point referred to the process as \"in a small way\" a \"kind of a referendum\".11 The JRP Report in the end decided that \"community core values\" were the overriding consideration in assessing the project. The community, reported the JRP, had an \"exceptionally strong and well defined vision of its future\"12 that precluded the development. \"The imposition of a major long-term industrial site would introduce a significant and irreversible change to Digby Neck and Islands, resulting in sufficiently important changes to that community's core values to warrant the Panel assessing them as a Significant Adverse Environmental Effect that cannot be mitigated\".13\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 512.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 4, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 14, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n21.\n\nIn Bilcon's submission, the finding on \"community core values\" was indeed the overriding consideration in the JRP Report. The latter did not make clear and comprehensive findings on whether all the specific impacts of the project would leave \"significant adverse effects after mitigation\", which is the standard required under the *CEAA*. Instead, having decided that the project was incompatible with the \"community's core values\", the Panel found it unnecessary to methodically assess the project's impact in terms of identifying risks, likelihood of each risk, magnitude of the risk and the existence of measures that might prevent the risk from being realized or mitigate it by way of restorative measures or compensation. Instead, the Panel identified a series of risks, largely driven by worst-case-scenarios, but made no thorough evidence-based effort to measure them against the standard of the *CEAA* and make recommendations on how they could be addressed by the proponent.\n\n22.\n\nBilcon submits that the JRP also misapplied the statutory requirements in other fundamental respects.14\n\nMemorial, para. 242 et seq.\n\n23.\n\nBilcon contends that \"community core values\" are not among the environmental impacts that are the lawful or proper scope of an environmental assessment process under the laws of federal Canada or Nova Scotia.15 The guidelines for the JRP refer to various social effects, like impact on values such as \"sense of place\", but do not refer to the concept of \"community core values\" that was decisive for the JRP. While social impacts can be considered, it should be in the context of a rational and evidence-based process whereby specific effects are identified and measures to avert or mitigate them are considered. As the concept is used by the JRP, \"core values\" in effect grant to local opponents a veto over the project16 which cannot be addressed effectively by any possible measure involving consultation, investigation and planning. No preventive or restorative measure could possibly be put in place to overcome it.\n\nMemorial, para. 257.\n\nMemorial, para. 258.\n\n24.\n\nBilcon contends that it was provided no notice that the concept of \"core values\" was a factor the Panel was going to consider,17 let alone a predominant one. Even within the ambit of its own overriding concern with \"community core values\", submits Bilcon, the JRP acted unfairly and unreasonably. Its conclusions disregarded the evidence before it that there were strong supporters, as well as opponents of the project;18 indeed, thirty per cent of the residents had signed a petition supporting the project. There was no basis to characterize opposition to the project as authorized to define the values of the community as a whole or to disregard the substantial measure of local support that existed and was publicly manifested, notwithstanding the intimidating tactics of some of the opponents.\n\nMemorial, para. 256.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 250-251.\n\n25.\n\nFollowing the submission of the JRP Report, Bilcon argues, the Governments of Nova Scotia and federal Canada each had a statutory duty to consider objections from Bilcon about flaws in the JRP's process or conclusions. Under the Nova Scotia Environment Act (\" *NSEA* \"), the Minister of the Environment had a duty to consider whether to approve the project and to impose such conditions as the Minister deems appropriate.19 When a project is rejected, the Minister must provide reasons in writing.20 The Minister, however, declined to meet with the proponent to hear its concerns, did not invite or receive any detailed written submission, and accepted the report.21 In this way, the Minister abdicated his responsibility to exercise his independent discretion, denied procedural fairness to Bilcon, and failed to explain his decision.22 The Government of federal Canada similarly abdicated its responsibilities, and instead \"rubberstamped\" the JRP's recommendations.\n\n*NSEA*, s. 39(2).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 39(3).\n\nMemorial, para. 270.\n\nMemorial, para. 275.\n\n26.\n\nIt is Bilcon's perspective that its project was consistent with both environmental integrity and economic development. The quarrying would have taken place in modest increments each year, with each area restored after it was used up. Natural visual barriers and designed buffer zones could have protected the land areas from disruption, and the marine terminal would have been built and operated in a manner consistent with preserving the natural habitat and industries, such as ecotourism and marine resource harvesting. The project would have provided needed jobs in an area that was threatened with the ongoing loss of population due to insufficient economic opportunities. Bilcon was taking on the investment risk needed to create the economic development in accordance with general and specific encouragements from government officials at both the political and technical levels to pursue a coastal quarry investment in Nova Scotia and indeed at the Whites Point area. All concerned expected that the project would have to go through environmental assessment in accordance with the laws of federal Canada and Nova Scotia, but Bilcon did not expect that it would be subjected to an adverse process and standard of evaluation different from that accorded to other investors, including Canadian investors, and that was not legally mandated.\n\n**C. THE ESSENCE OF THE RESPONDENT'S CASE**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe essence of Canada's case is as follows.\n\n28.\n\nCanada submits that the site of the White Points Quarry was in an ecologically sensitive area.23 The site had not previously been home to industrial development of the nature of the proposed Bilcon project. Whatever encouragements of a general or specific nature from governments concerning mining and export projects were subject to the clear understanding that the proponent would have to comply with both federal and provincial laws concerning the environment.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 22-32.\n\n29.\n\nAs officials of Nova Scotia and federal Canada became aware of the project, including by way of a request for permission to conduct test blasts, federal and provincial officials consulted with each other in a normal and lawful manner. It was reasonable and appropriate for Nova Scotia officials to consult with federal Canada officials on matters such as the potential damage to marine life and to draw on their expertise in matters such as the appropriate conditions to attach to test blasting.24\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 71.\n\n30.\n\nMinister Thibault submitted a sworn affidavit25 to the effect that when he first heard of the project he remembers thinking that it might be good news for his constituents, but he also heard from the outset about opposition to it. He understood that environmental assessment should not be used for the purpose of either rubber stamping or stopping a project. While he wanted to stay informed about events in his own riding, as Minister of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, at no time did he interfere with the work of public servants and only made decisions when they requested him to do so. He swore that he found it incomprehensible that anyone would think that it was in his interests to delay the environmental assessment of the project. Bilcon chose not to cross-examine Minister Thibault.\n\nAffidavit of Robert Thibault, dated 26 November 2011.\n\n31.\n\nCanada introduced affidavit evidence from a number of officials who were involved in the various decisions along the way from consideration of the test blast application to the decision to refer the matter to a JRP. Some of them appeared at the hearing and were subjected to rigorous cross-examination. Canada submits that unless it was demonstrated by Bilcon that these officials were not telling the truth, the conclusion must be that they indeed acted throughout in a reasonable and good faith manner.26 Canada argues that it is important, in assessing the various steps taken, to not view any particular observation or step in isolation, but to recognize that there was a collaborative process among officials carried out over a course of time. Various officials weighed in with their perspectives from time to time in light of a developing understanding of the facts and issues involved.27\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 280.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 258-259.\n\n32.\n\nCanada contends that the decision to refer the project to a JRP must be appreciated in context. A marine terminal project of this size would, in any event, by law have to be subjected to a Comprehensive Study, which in itself is an extensive and rigorous kind of environmental assessment.28 Carrying out the most summary form of assessment, a screening, was not a lawful option. It was a lawful and reasonable interpretation of the *CEAA*, as then stated and interpreted by officials and judges, that the quarry would be assessed along with the marine terminal as the former was sufficiently connected with the latter and because the quarry raised concerns within the scope of federal jurisdiction, such as impact of blasting on marine mammals.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 133.\n\n33.\n\nThe referral to a federal Canada Review Panel rather than a Comprehensive Study, was a lawful and reasonable decision in light of concerns about environmental impacts and concerns expressed by a number of members of the local community.29 Federal Canada officials and Nova Scotia officials concurred that a JRP would be an appropriate means of coordinating the assessments by the two jurisdictions.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 150.\n\n34.\n\nIn Canada's submission, Bilcon's emphasis on alleged failures to comply with the *CEAA* was misguided. Both federal Canada and Nova Scotia had to approve of the project under their environmental assessment laws. The provincial law was more expansive than federal Canada's with respect to the scope of assessment. Nova Scotia had rejected the project following the submission of the JRP Report and before Canada's final decision. Any alleged errors in the JRP's application of federal Canada's law or by Canada in making a final decision were therefore moot.30\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 300.\n\n35.\n\nCanada submitted a report by an experienced and independent expert that reviewed the procedural path and report of the JRP. In his opinion, the mandate of the JRP, the composition of the Panel and the manner in which it conducted the hearings were proper. The analysis and conclusions in the report were appropriate within the overall framework of federal Canada and Nova Scotia environmental assessment laws. Any Investors' complaints based on the alleged scope of assessments under the former were irrelevant in light of the latter. With respect to the \"community core values\" approach, the environmental assessment guidelines stipulated by the JRP provided adequate notice to Bilcon and the approach itself was consistent with both the mandate of the JRP and the overall framework of federal Canada and provincial law governing environmental assessments. The JRP did not treat the matter as a \"referendum\"; its lengthy and detailed final report in fact reviewed the environmental impact of the project in light of its thorough review of all the evidence. The Investors are responsible for the inadequacies in their own environmental impact statement, and the JRP had the duty to consider and take into account the submissions of community members, including information about \"community core values\" and the impact the project would have on them. After the JRP reported, the Investors had a fair opportunity to submit their position to federal Canada and Nova Scotia before the authorities arrived at their final determinations in light of the information and analysis provided by the JRP.\n\n36.\n\nWith respect to any NAFTA challenge, Canada submitted a number of jurisdictional defences. Canada contended that part of the Investors' complaint concerned events that could not be the subject of a NAFTA claim because they were barred by the time limitation periods under Chapter Eleven. Further, argued Canada, the JRP was not an entity for which Canada was accountable in international law. To the extent that the JRP had jurisdiction over the various complaints by Bilcon, Canada argued that it was necessary to evaluate the facts in light of a proper understanding of the relevant norms for state conduct in Chapter Eleven. The \"minimum international standard\" is meant to address matters where state conduct is egregious. NAFTA precedents concerning the minimum standard under international law have consistently emphasized that there is a high threshold of seriousness that must be reached before alleged misconduct raises to a level that implicates international responsibility on the basis that it breaches the minimum international standard of fair and equitable treatment. While NAFTA does not require that local remedies be exhausted before bringing a complaint, the fact remains that any complaints of the Investors could have been considered in a judicial review process by Canadian courts under Canadian law and were not matters that triggered international responsibility.\n\n37.\n\nWith respect to Article 1102, National Treatment, and Article 1103, Most Favored Nation, the cases invoked by the Investors did not involve investors in \"like circumstances\". It is important to appreciate the distinct facts of this case, which involved a long-term industrial scale marine terminal and quarry project in an environmentally sensitive area in which many members of the local community expressed strong concerns and objections. Consequently, a JRP was commissioned rather than some other mode of assessment.\n\n38.\n\nCanada submitted that Bilcon's complaint should be dismissed entirely at the liability stage, thereby concluding the matter.\n\n39.\n\nThis Award addresses the Respondent's challenges to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as well as the Respondent's liability in principle pursuant to NAFTA Chapter Eleven. As agreed between the Parties, the quantification of damages will be dealt with in a separate phase of the present arbitration if and to the extent that the Tribunal finds liability in principle.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nOn February 5, 2008, the Investors served upon the Government of Canada a Notice of Intent to submit a Claim to Arbitration (\"Notice of Intent\") in accordance with NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1119 with respect to Respondent's alleged violation of its obligations under Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n41.\n\nOn 26 May 2008, the Investors filed a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules and NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1120. On 5 August 2008, the Parties agreed that the effective filing date of the Notice of Arbitration was 17 June 2008.\n\n42.\n\nThe Investors appointed Professor Bryan Schwartz as the first arbitrator. The Respondent appointed Professor Donald McRae as the second arbitrator. On 26 January 2009, the Parties invited Judge Bruno Simma to act as President of the Tribunal. On 29 January 2009, Judge Bruno Simma accepted the invitation. The Parties confirmed the proper constitution of the Tribunal at the first procedural meeting, as recorded in Procedural Order No. 1 of 9 April 2009.\n\n43.\n\nOn 30 January 2009, the Investors filed their Statement of Claim.\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 March 2009, the Parties and the Tribunal held a first procedural meeting in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\n45.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which fixed Toronto, Ontario, Canada as the place of arbitration and provided that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") would administer the arbitral proceedings and provide registry services and administrative support.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Statement of Defense on 4 May 2009.\n\n47.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 providing the Parties with guidance on the appropriate classification of confidential information. The Order also provided that any hearings would be open to the public except when necessary to protect confidential information.\n\n48.\n\nOn 11 May 2009, the Respondent applied for bifurcation of the proceedings between a liability phase and a damages phase. The Investors objected on 14 May 2009. On 3 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 ordering the bifurcation of the proceedings as between jurisdiction/liability, on the one hand, and quantum, on the other hand. In the same Order, the Tribunal established principles for the taking of evidence in the present arbitration, including by making provision for document production.\n\n49.\n\nOn 16 June 2009, the Respondent filed a motion challenging the Investors' designation of confidential information in the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim. The Tribunal resolved the question in its Procedural Order No. 4 dated 17 July 2009, after considering comments from both sides.\n\n50.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, at the Tribunal's direction, the Investors submitted an Amended Statement of Claim, elaborating certain aspects of their claims.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent submitted an Amended Statement of Defense on 18 December 2009.\n\n**B. DOCUMENT PRODUCTION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. The Process for Document Requests and Objections**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nPursuant to the direction of the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3, the Parties exchanged requests for documents in the possession, custody or control of the other side on 2 July 2009.\n\n53.\n\nOn 9 July 2009, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Investors to amend their document production requests on the ground that they lacked the specificity required by the Tribunal's earlier direction. After receiving the views of the Parties, on 24 July 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which it ordered the Investors to revise certain document requests and invited the Respondent to interpret other requests \"in light of the Disputing Parties' previous submissions (in particular, the Investors' Statement of Claim)\".\n\n54.\n\nOn 20 August 2009, following an exchange of documents, and notices from both sides refusing to produce certain documents, the Investors requested that the Tribunal grant an extension of time for it to comment on the Respondent's production, alleging that the Respondent's failure to provide an index of the documents that it had produced prejudiced the Investors in respect of their ability to respond. After receiving the views of both sides, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on 26 August 2009, denying the Investors' requested extension.\n\n55.\n\nOn 11 September 2009, both sides submitted to the Tribunal an application in the form of a Redfern Schedule detailing requests for documents, the objections of the opposing side, and the requesting Party's replies thereto.\n\n56.\n\nOn 16 October 2009, the Tribunal held a first case management meeting with the Parties in Toronto to discuss the process for their ongoing document production and explore ways in which the Parties' disagreement might be limited. The Tribunal was assisted in this regard by briefs submitted by the Parties on 13 October 2009.\n\n57.\n\nOn 20 November 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, providing further instructions concerning document production. The Tribunal also defined a process for dealing with claims of cabinet privilege, political sensitivity, or legal privilege in a separate process.\n\n58.\n\nOn 25 November 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, in which it provided guidance on the scope and nature of production and ordered the Parties to produce, by 18 December 2009, all remaining documents requested by the other side, with the exception of documents subject to a privilege claim. On 2 December 2009, the Respondent filed an application for an extension of the time period set out in Procedural Order No. 8 for it to complete its document review and production. The Respondent estimated that its lawyers were required to review at least 75,000 documents to respond to the Investors' requests.\n\n59.\n\nOn 14 December 2009, the Tribunal revised the timetable for production set out in Procedural Order No. 8, fixing 25 April 2010 as the new deadline for the production of remaining documents (except for documents subject to privilege claims), and invited the Parties to report periodically on the progress made in the location, review and production of documents. The Parties filed their first reports in response to the Tribunal's invitation on 25 February 2010.\n\n60.\n\nOn 12 April 2010, the Respondent reported again on the progress of its document production and requested \"an indefinite extension\" of the deadline for document production. The Tribunal denied the Respondent's requested extension by letter dated 11 May 2010. On 14 June 2010, the Respondent provided a third status report on document production.\n\n61.\n\nOn 28 June 2010, the Tribunal held a second case management meeting with the Parties in Toronto to discuss the progress of the Parties' document production. On 16 July 2010, in light of the discussion at the meeting and following additional submissions from both sides, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 giving guidance to the Parties on outstanding questions regarding document production, such as indexing and automized searches on the basis of date parameters and search terms. The Tribunal also established that some documents\u2014Category A documents\u2014would be produced as a matter of priority, whereas other documents\u2014Category B documents\u2014would be produced no later than the due date of the Respondent's CounterMemorial.\n\n62.\n\nFollowing a further status update from the Respondent on 19 August 2010, and additional communications from both Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 on 2 September 2010, in which it fixed a revised timetable for the remaining phases of document production.\n\n**2. Documents Not Produced for Reasons of Privilege**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn their 11 September 2009 request for the production of documents, and subsequent amended requests, the Investors objected to the Respondent's refusal to produce certain documents due to what the Respondent called their \"special political or institutional sensitivity\" as well as other documents over which the Respondent claimed solicitor-client privilege and attorney work product privilege.\n\n64.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, further to a request by the Tribunal, each Party commented on the legal principles governing the Tribunal's consideration of claims of legal privilege and political sensitivity, as well as the process and schedule for the Tribunal's consideration of privilege objections. As noted above, following the 16 October 2009 case management meeting with the Parties, the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 7 dated 20 November 2009 defined a process for the exchange of privilege logs justifying claims that documents should not be produced for reasons of privilege or sensitivity.\n\n65.\n\nOn 10 March 2010, following a review of the Parties' document production status reports of February 2010, the Tribunal reiterated that the Parties would be invited to exchange privilege logs following the completion of document production by 25 April 2010.\n\n66.\n\nOn 16 April 2010, the Investors requested that the Respondent be required to file an interim privilege log on all documents reviewed up to that date. The Respondent answered on the same day, arguing that the preparation of an interim privilege log would further delay the production of documents. On 6 May 2010, the Investors complained to the Tribunal that the Respondent had indicated it would not comply with the Tribunal's instruction to provide any privilege logs.\n\n67.\n\nFollowing the 28 June 2010 case management meeting, the Tribunal revised the timeline and procedure for the exchange of privilege logs, setting out these changes in Procedural Order No. 9.\n\n68.\n\nOn 27 August 2010, the Tribunal denied a request by the Investors to require the Respondent to produce letters exchanged between Canada's Trade Law Bureau and other government departments, agencies and individuals. The Respondent had maintained that the disclosure of these letters served no useful purpose and that, in any event, they were protected by solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege. The Tribunal considered that production of those letters would not assist the document production process.\n\n69.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, the Investors informed the Tribunal that the Respondent advised them that it \"may have inadvertently disclosed documents... which it now contends are covered by privilege\". After reviewing the comments of both Parties on the matter, the Tribunal, on 19 April 2011, informed the Parties that it would take up the issue of the inadvertently disclosed documents together with the other issues of privilege.\n\n70.\n\nOn 21 June 2011, the Investors requested an extension to file their Memorial to review the newly produced documents that the Respondent had belatedly located. The Tribunal granted the Investors' request on 29 June 2011.\n\n71.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, the Investors filed a motion requesting that the Tribunal order that the Respondent explain all redactions, including the identity of those who made the determination that redaction was needed, the timing of the determination, and the criteria used for making the determination; that the Respondent produce non-redacted copies of all documents that had been redacted on any basis other than privilege; and that the Investors and their experts be entitled to adduce any resulting evidence in subsequent successive rounds of pleadings. In reply, the Respondent argued by letter dated 20 July 2011 that it had complied with its document production obligations by redacting documents that were either partially irrelevant or privileged.\n\n72.\n\nOn 10 August 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, in which it directed that redactions made for reasons of privilege be noted in the Respondent's privilege log. It requested that, with regard to documents redacted on the basis of partial irrelevance, the Respondent provide the Investor with the full unredacted documents; however, if the Respondent had reason to believe that the disclosure of such information would prejudice a third party, the Respondent could apply for an exception to the direction.\n\n73.\n\nOn 15 February 2012, the Investors filed a motion in which they requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to make available for examination Mr. Yves LeBoeuf, Vice President of Operations at the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (\"CEA Agency\"), who provided a statement supporting the Respondent's representation of its privilege submission.\n\n74.\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the Tribunal suspended the timetable of the Investors' replies on the Respondent's objections to production in respect of such documents for which the Respondent relied on Mr. LeBoeuf's affidavit to justify their privileged status. On 23 February 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would reserve its decision on the Investors' request concerning Mr. LeBoeuf until it had a full picture of the Parties' contested privilege claims and accompanying evidence.\n\n75.\n\nFollowing the submission of several revised privilege logs from the Parties and exchanges of views on each Party's privilege claims, on 2 May 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, in which it established standards to be applied to the Parties' claims regarding solicitor-client privilege and work product privilege, and determined that the Respondent had not waived privilege over the inadvertently disclosed documents. The Tribunal ordered that the Respondent review its claims of privilege in light of the elaborated standards and produce any documents that did not qualify for protection under those standards.\n\n76.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, the Investors informed the Tribunal that they no longer wished to examine Mr. LeBoeuf at the procedural hearing planned for 8 June 2012. The Respondents asserted on 18 May 2012 that the procedural hearing was therefore \"no longer necessary as all of the outstanding contested claims of privilege may be resolved without requiring the disputing parties to incur the significant costs of an oral hearing\". On 23 May 2012, having considered the Parties' correspondence, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the 8 June 2012 procedural hearing would be maintained. The hearing was held in Toronto.\n\n77.\n\nOn 11 July 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 addressing the objections to document production on the basis of special political or institutional sensitivity. It required that certain documents be reviewed again by the Respondent in light of the Tribunal's interpretation of the rules on privilege applicable in NAFTA Chapter Eleven arbitrations; and concluded that the Respondent had shown that other documents had been subject to sufficient review in good faith to be considered privileged and did not need to be disclosed.\n\n78.\n\nBy separate letter also dated 11 July 2012, in response to a request by the Respondent concerning the Investors' blanket privilege claim over documents created after 1 October 2007, the Tribunal ordered the Investors to provide the Respondent with a supplemental privilege log listing all such privileged documents responsive to the Respondent's earlier document request.\n\n**3. Documents in the Possession of Third Parties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nDuring the 28 June 2010 case management meeting, and in two letters dated 30 June 2010 and 5 July 2010, as well as in a 16 July 2010 motion, the Investors requested that the Tribunal issue an interim award ordering that certain electronic records said to be under the control of former JRP members involved in the Whites Point project EA be preserved, and that the Investors be allowed to examine the JRP members.\n\n80.\n\nHaving considered the views of both Parties, the Tribunal noted in its 27 August 2010 letter to the Parties that it did not consider it appropriate to make an order or to issue an interim award in respect of non-parties to the proceedings as requested by the Investors; however, the Tribunal asked the Respondent to undertake certain efforts to seek further information from the three former JRP members on the topic of the existence and preservation of electronic correspondence in respect of the Whites Point project.\n\n81.\n\nOn 30 September 2010 and 14 October 2010, the Respondent provided the Tribunal and the Investors with copies of letters from the members of the JRP responding to the query set out by the Tribunal.\n\n82.\n\nOn 3 November 2010, the Investors alleged that the JRP members did not fully answer the questions they were asked and, on 23 November 2010, the Investors filed a supplemental motion for the examination of the JRP members. On 9 December 2010, the Respondent provided additional correspondence from the JRP members in response to the questions put to them.\n\n83.\n\nFollowing a further exchange of views with the Parties, the Tribunal on 30 December 2010 stated that it would not require the examination of the JRP members at that stage and reserved the Respondent's request for the allocation of costs for further consideration.\n\n**4. Documents Post-dating 5 February 2008**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nOn 10 August 2012, the Investors sought an order from the Tribunal that the Respondent disclose documents dated later than 5 February 2008 (the date of the Notice of Intent). On 15 August 2012, the Respondent replied that it did not possess any such documents and noted its view that \"anything that postdates February 5th, 2008, can't be relevant for this claim, can't be relevant or responsive to a document request for this claim\".\n\n85.\n\nOn 17 August 2012, the Tribunal asked the Respondent to clarify:\n\nwhether there are - or may be - any documents that are responsive to the Investors' request and were created after 5 February 2008. If that is the case, the Tribunal requests the Respondent to provide... a short submission... in support of its position that it need not produce any documents created subsequently to the Notice of Intent in the present proceeding.\n\nThe Tribunal invited the Investors to comment on the Respondent's clarification and/or submission.\n\n86.\n\nOn 24 August 2012, the Respondent replied that it was not aware of any documents responsive to the Investors' request for documents created after the date of the Notice of Intent. In addition, according to the Respondent, the Investors had waived the question of a cut-off date by not raising the issue earlier in the proceedings. Finally, the Respondent argued that to carry out an additional search for such documents would be overly time-consuming and burdensome.\n\n87.\n\nHaving considered the communications of both Parties, on 19 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14. In this Order, the Tribunal affirmed the Parties' continuing duty to disclose new information relevant and material to the arbitration and responsive to an opposing Party's request. However, the Tribunal also considered that it \"would not be productive for the Disputing Parties to conduct an additional search for documents post-dating February 5, 2008 that may be responsive to the opposing Party's document production requests\", referring to procedural economy and the small likelihood that such a search would result in the production of new evidence of significant probative value. Without prejudice to this general direction, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to produce certain letters that the Respondent had already identified in prior correspondence, the identification of which accordingly did not require a new search.\n\n88.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, the Investors informed the Tribunal that they believed that the Respondent had omitted certain non-privileged documents post-dating 5 February 2008 when it produced responsive documents on 19 October 2012 pursuant to Procedural Order No. 14. They requested that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference against the Respondent on the ground that its 19 October 2012 production did not include \"relevant documents that obviously exist, or that must be taken to exist\".\n\n89.\n\nOn 15 November 2012, taking note of the Parties' correspondence regarding the \"nonproduction of relevant documents\", the Tribunal reserved its decision as to whether any adverse inference should be drawn from the Respondent's alleged non-production.\n\n**C. INTERROGATORIES**\n----------------------\n\n90.\n\nOn 9 May 2012, the Investors sought leave to issue a set of interrogatories to the Respondent including: questions seeking further document production or clarification regarding the existence of documents; questions seeking clarification of facts articulated in the Respondent's Counter-Memorial; and, questions related to information contained in witness affidavits.\n\n91.\n\nFollowing direction from the Tribunal at the 8 June 2012 procedural hearing, on 9 July 2012, the Respondent submitted its responses to the Investors' interrogatories. On 10 August 2012, the Tribunal requested that the Respondent provide more information in response to one of the Investors' interrogatories, regarding which the Respondent could likely provide an immediate response. The Respondent replied on 11 September 2012.\n\n92.\n\nOn 11 January 2013, the Respondent filed an application for leave to file interrogatories directed to the Investors.\n\n93.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, after receiving comments from both sides, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17, granting the Respondent leave to file a limited number of interrogatories and setting out the process in this regard.\n\n94.\n\nOn 11 February 2013, the Investors submitted their responses to the Respondent's interrogatories.\n\n**D. WRITTEN PLEADINGS**\n------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Investors submitted their Memorial on 25 July 2011.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on 9 December 2011.\n\n97.\n\nAfter considering comments from the Parties concerning a proposed timetable, on 17 October 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 in which it adopted a revised procedural calendar and confirmed that the hearing on jurisdiction and merits would take place from 17 to 28 June 2013.\n\n98.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Investors submitted their Reply.\n\n99.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n100.\n\nOn 28 March 2013, the Tribunal offered the non-disputing NAFTA Parties an opportunity to make submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128. On 19 April 2013, the Tribunal received a submission from the United States of America.\n\n**E. HEARING ON JURISDICTION AND MERITS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nOn 16 April 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 18, which addressed logistical and procedural matters concerning the hearing on jurisdiction and merits and which asked the Parties to provide an agreed timeline of facts relevant to the dispute.\n\n102.\n\nOn 26 April 2013, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 18, each of the Parties identified the witnesses and experts it intended to cross-examine at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.\n\n103.\n\nOn 17 May 2013, each side provided the Tribunal with its version of a timeline of relevant facts.\n\n104.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing on jurisdiction and merits had to be postponed. On 17 June 2013, the Parties agreed to the Tribunal's proposed revised dates for the hearing: from 22 October to 1 November 2013.\n\n105.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and merits was held in Toronto from 22 October to 25 October 2013, and from 28 October to 31 October 2013. The following persons attended the hearing:\n\n**For the Investors:**\n\nMr. Barry Appleton\n\nMr. Gregory J. Nash\n\nMr. Frank S. Borowicz\n\nDr. Alan Alexandroff\n\nMr. Kyle Dickson-Smith\n\nMr. Josh Scheinert\n\nMs. Celeste Mowatt\n\nMr. Chris Elrich\n\nProfessor Robert Howse\n\nMs. Sue Ki\n\nMr. Josh Hauser\n\nMr. John Evers\n\nMr. David Consky\n\nMs. Jessica McKeachie\n\nMs. Jennifer Montfort\n\nMs. April Jangkamolkulchai\n\nMs. Sandra Albia\n\nMs. Mary Grace Ruaya\n\nMs. Lauren Wilcocks\n\nMr. Michael Pogorzelski\n\nMr. Vasyl Didukh\n\nMr. William Richard Clayton\n\nMr. John Lizak\n\nMr. Paul Buxton\n\nMr. David Estrin\n\nProfessor Murray Rankin\n\n**For the Respondent:**\n\nMr. Scott Little\n\nMr. Shane Spelliscy\n\nMr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9bert\n\nMr. Stephen Kurelek\n\nMr. Reuben East\n\nMr. Adam Douglas\n\nMr. Robert Connelly\n\nMs. Elizabeth Hrubesz\n\nMs. Cheryl Fabian-Bernard\n\nMr. Alex Miller\n\nMs. Chris Reynolds\n\nMs. Jasmine Rokolj\n\nMr. Alex George\n\nMr. David Bartol Mr. Kevin LeBlanc Mr. Neil Bellefontaine Mr. Stephen Chapman Mr. Christopher Daly Mr. Bruce Hood Mr. Mark McLean Mr. Bob Petrie Mr. Lawrence E. Smith\n\n**The Arbitral Tribunal:**\n\nJudge Bruno Simma Professor Donald McRae Professor Bryan Schwartz\n\n**For the Registry:**\n\nDr. Dirk Pulkowski Ms. Kathleen Claussen\n\n106.\n\nOn 20 December 2013 and 14 February 2014, the Parties submitted annotated versions of their opening and closing statements, respectively, as presented at the hearing.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal has made every effort to ensure that both Parties have had a full and fair opportunity to discover and present relevant evidence. It ordered the production of documents from both sides, an exercise which resulted in the identification and review of thousands of documents and the production to the other side of a great many of them. The Parties, with an exemplary level of diligence and skill, submitted detailed written submissions that reviewed the documentary evidence, identified and argued vigorously for their view of the law, and proposed how the law applied to the facts. The Parties then participated in an eight-day hearing on jurisdiction and merits in which they cross-examined selected witnesses from each side.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully studied the submissions of both Parties, both on fact and law. It listened attentively throughout eight days of the hearing on jurisdiction and merits and has reviewed the transcripts. In writing this Award, the Tribunal has attempted to provide a reasonably concise explanation of its reasoning and conclusions. The fact that not all evidence and arguments have been referred to in these reasons should not be construed in any way as an omission to take conscientiously into consideration the entire record in the course of its deliberation. The Tribunal has in fact reviewed with care all the material submitted. In presenting its conclusions, however, the Tribunal has attempted to proceed in a reasonably focused manner. It is hoped that this distilled approach will assist the Parties and the international community in understanding the Tribunal's conclusion and contribute to the understanding and development of the law in this area.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. THE INVESTORS**\n--------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Investors request the following relief:\n\n(a) A declaration that Canada has acted in a manner inconsistent with its Chapter 11 obligations of national treatment, most favored nation treatment, and international law standards of treatment, in breach of its obligations under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105;\n\n(b) A declaration dismissing Canada's jurisdictional objections;\n\n(c) A declaration that the claim proceed forthwith to the Quantification of Damages;\n\n(d) Damages arising from the delays, suppression of evidence, and non-production of documents by Canada; and\n\n(e) An award in favor of the Investors' for all costs, disbursements and expenses incurred in the merits phase of the arbitration for legal representation and assistance, plus interest, and costs of the Tribunal.31\n\nMemorial, para. 779.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent requests the following relief:\n\nCanada respectfully requests that this Tribunal render an award dismissing the Claimants' claims in their entirety and ordering the Claimants to bear the costs of the arbitration in full and to indemnify Canada for its legal costs, disbursements and expenses incurred in the defence of this claim, as well as the costs of the Tribunal, plus interest. Canada also requests the opportunity to make submissions on the costs that it has been forced to incur as a result of this claim.32\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 491; Rejoinder, para. 215.\n\n**IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n--------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe present arbitration results from the Parties' disagreement as to the appropriateness of the treatment accorded by the Respondent to the Investors in the context of the EA of the Whites Point project.\n\n112.\n\nAs noted earlier, various corporate entities were involved in the project proposal on the Investors' side. Bilcon is a company incorporated in Nova Scotia; it is a wholly owned subsidiary company of Bilcon of Delaware, Inc., a company incorporated in Delaware, which is in turn owned and controlled by Messrs. Douglas Clayton, William Richard Clayton and Daniel Clayton.33\n\nMemorial, paras. 32 et seq.\n\n113.\n\nTogether with Nova Stone, also a company incorporated in Nova Scotia, Bilcon formed Global Quarry Products (\"GQP\"), a partnership registered in Nova Scotia in April 2002.34 On 1 April 2004, Bilcon acquired Nova Stone's interest in GQP. As a result, GQP was dissolved, and Bilcon itself entered into a lease agreement with the owners of the Whites Point property.\n\nThe Investors refer to 24 April 2002 as the relevant date of the partnership. Partnership Agreement between Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Nova Stone Exporters, Inc., Exhibit C-22; Letter of Intent from Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. to Nova Stone Exporters, dated 28 March 2002, Exhibit C-5; Memorial, para. 46. The Respondent refers to 25 April 2002 as the relevant date. Application for Registration of a Business Name, Sole Proprietorship or Partnership by Nova Stone Exporters Inc. and Bilcon of Nova Scotia, Corp., dated 24 April 2002, Exhibit R-291; Global Quarry Products Certificate of Registration, dated 25 April 2002, Exhibit R-292; Counter-Memorial, para. 41.\n\n114.\n\nIn addition to members of the Clayton family, Mr. Paul Buxton, the registered agent and project manager for Bilcon, played a material role in the planning and application for regulatory approval of the Whites Point project. Much of the relevant communication in relation to the project application was relayed to Respondent's authorities through Mr. Buxton.\n\n115.\n\nKey actors on the Respondent's side include: Mr. Robert Thibault, former Department of Fisheries and Oceans (\"DFO\") Minister and the Member of Parliament for the riding in which the Whites Point project was located; the Honourable Kerry Morash, Minister of Nova Scotia's Department of Environment and Labour (\"NSDEL\"); and Mr. Gordon Balser, former Minister in Nova Scotia, who was the provincial member of the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly for the constituency in which the Whites Point project was located.\n\n116.\n\nAt the civil servant level, the Parties frequently refer to Mr. Robert (\"Bob\") Petrie, District Manager in the Regional Environmental Monitoring and Compliance Division at the NSDEL and Mr. Bruce Hood, former Senior Liaison Officer for Habitat Operations at the DFO in Ottawa.\n\n117.\n\nTwo general remarks should be made at the outset. First, while the Investors' core claim stems from the decisions of Nova Scotia and Canada to reject the Investors' Whites Point project proposal, the Investors also advance numerous specific claims with regard to their treatment by the federal and provincial authorities from when these authorities began to evaluate a proposal by Nova Stone to operate a 3.9 ha quarry. The factual summary focuses mainly on the EA of the Whites Point proposal by Nova Scotia and Canada, and is hence not exhaustive. The Parties discuss many of the disputed facts in connection with their legal arguments. To limit repetition, the Tribunal summarizes certain facts in Part VI concerning the merits of the Investors' claims rather than in the present Part. Secondly, the Investors do not consistently distinguish between Bilcon and GQP. By contrast, the Respondent distinguishes these two different undertakings as it contests the standing of Bilcon to bring claims with respect to Nova Stone's industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry. For the sake of clarity and without prejudice to the Investors' position, the Tribunal follows the Respondent's terminology and distinguishes between the different undertakings, except when it quotes from the submissions of the Investors.\n\n118.\n\nFor the purpose of the present Award, the Tribunal has reviewed a voluminous record of evidence, documenting all aspects of the case that the Tribunal has found to be relevant to the Parties' claims and defences in detail. Accordingly, the Tribunal is confident that it was put in a position where it was able to reach an informed determination of the facts, without the need to have recourse (as the Parties' have invited the Tribunal to do) to the drawing of adverse inferences.\n\n119.\n\nDue to the large number of disputed facts, the Statement of Facts is divided into four main sections, which are organized chronologically: the request for an industrial approval to operate a 3.9 ha quarry; the interactions between the government entities and the Investors in the lead-up to the EA; the referral to the JRP, the establishment and the work of the JRP; and finally the ministerial decisions following the recommendation made by the JRP.\n\n**A. THE REQUEST FOR AN INDUSTRIAL APPROVAL TO OPERATE A 3.9 HA QUARRY**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n120.\n\nOn 6 February 2002, Nova Stone applied to the Canadian Coast Guard under s. 5 of the *Navigable Waters Protection Act* (\" *NWPA* \") for a permit to build a \"floating loading dock\" in Nova Scotia at Whites Point in Digby Neck.35\n\nMemorial, para. 103; Application Form by Nova Stone Exporters Inc., 6 February 2002, Exhibit C-35.\n\n121.\n\nOn 18 February 2002, Nova Stone applied to the NSDEL for a permit to construct and operate a quarry on the Whites Point project site. The NSDEL rejected this application on 15 April 2002 as it concluded that the proposed quarry exceeded 4 ha, the maximum size permitted through the basic NSDEL approval process.36 Any quarry greater than 4 ha requires an EA before it can proceed in Nova Scotia.37\n\nThe Respondent states that the first application was redesigned by the Investors and submitted as a new application (Counter-Memorial, para. 66; Application for Approval, 23 April 2002, Exhibit R-78). In its Rejoinder, it states that the 15 April 2002 application was rejected (para. 52). The Investors do not specifically address the two applications.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 66; E-mail from Mark McLean to Brad Langille and Bob Petrie, dated 11 April 2002, Exhibit R-76.\n\n122.\n\nOn 23 April 2002, Nova Stone submitted a new application for a permit to build a quarry at the Whites Point project site that was limited to 3.9 ha.38 The NSDEL issued this permit on 30 April 2002. The approval was made subject to certain blasting conditions added at the DFO's request (the \"Blasting Conditions\").\n\nRejoinder, para. 52, n.92; Nova Stone Application for Approval, 23 April 2002, Exhibit R-78.\n\n123.\n\nThe Blasting Conditions required Nova Stone to carry out blasting in accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Explosives In or Near Canadian Fisheries Waters (the \"Blasting Guidelines\"); and to submit a report in advance of any blasting activity verifying that the intended charge size would not have an impact on marine mammals in the area.39 As explained further below, the Parties disagree on whether the DFO had authority to attach certain of the Blasting Conditions to the permit and whether the concerns about the impact of blasting on marine mammals in the Bay of Fundy were genuine.\n\nApproval for the Construction and Operation of a Quarry at or near Little River, Digby County in the Province of Nova Scotia, 30 April 2002, Exhibit C-31.\n\n124.\n\nBetween September and November 2002, Nova Stone submitted three blasting plans to the NSDEL and the DFO in connection with Blasting Conditions applicable to the 3.9 ha quarry. The DFO requested additional information with regard to the first two blasting plans. As explained below, the Parties diverge on the reasons that led the DFO to request further information. While the third blasting plan was sufficiently detailed, the DFO did not allow Nova Stone to proceed with blasting, maintaining that the determination on the blasting plan had become tied to the determinations necessary for the EA of the Whites Point project.40\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 90\n\n125.\n\nOn 29 May 2003, the DFO found that the proposed blasting activity on the 3.9 ha quarry required authorization under s. 32 of the *Fisheries Act* (\" *Fisheries Act* \") and directed a setback distance of 500 meters from the shoreline.41\n\nLetter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 29 May 2003, Exhibit C-129.\n\n126.\n\nNova Stone's permit for the 3.9 ha quarry terminated on 1 May 2004.\n\n**2. Disputed Facts**\n---------------------\n\n127.\n\nSeveral facts are in dispute: whether Digby Neck was already an industrialized area prior to Bilcon's investment or whether it was an area of particular environmental concern; whether provincial and federal authorities encouraged the investment in the area of Digby Neck in the summer of 2002; whether the DFO had authority to attach certain of the Blasting Conditions to the 3.9 ha permit of 30 April 2002; whether the concerns about the impact of blasting on marine mammals in the Bay of Fundy were genuine; and, whether the blasting plans submitted by Nova Stone were unfairly not approved.\n\n**(a) Whether Digby Neck was an Industrialized Area**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Investors contend that Nova Scotia is \"no stranger to industry\".42 They maintain that rock quarries have a long history in Nova Scotia. The Investors point to documents made available by provincial entities such as a circular of the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, entitled \"Industrial Minerals in Nova Scotia,\"43 its leaflet entitled \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia,\"44 and another leaflet entitled \"Take Advantage of Mineral Exploration and Development in Nova Scotia\".45 According to the Investors, these pamphlets illustrate the government's encouragement for and recognition of the mineral industry by exploration and mining activities as part of its overall industrial strategy. In these documents, the province recognized mineral exploration and mining \"as a key sector contributing to jobs, wealth and a high quality of life for Nova Scotians\".46\n\nReply, para. 31.\n\nNSDNR, Information Circular ME 24, \"Industrial Minerals in Nova Scotia\", dated 1992, Exhibit C-10.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", dated 1996, Exhibit C-7.\n\nNSDNR, Information Circular, \"Take Advantage of Mineral Exploration and Development in Nova Scotia\", dated 1996, Exhibit C-8.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", dated 1996, Exhibit C-7, p. 1.\n\n129.\n\nThe Investors further observe that the proposed site of the quarry is in a sparsely populated rural area separated from local communities by a mountain. According to the Investors, the quarry site had been clear-cut logged and used as a gravel pit to build roads and highways in Nova Scotia.47\n\nReply, para. 36; Supplemental Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, paras. 4-6 (\"Whites Point had a history of industrial use\").\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes the importance and uniqueness of the biophysical and human environment in Digby Neck and the adjacent Bay of Fundy.48 It maintains that \"there are no large-scale quarries or other industrial developments and no significant marine terminals [in the area of Digby Neck]. Further, efforts to establish such projects have been firmly resisted by the community\".49 The Respondent argues that the Bay of Fundy is the habitat of many endangered species and the economy of the local area is based on the region's ecological assets. Fishing and ecotourism have been strong components of the local economy in recent years, according to the Respondent.50\n\nThe Atlas of Canada, UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, Natural Resources Canada, Exhibit R-282 and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Information, Southwest Nova, Exhibit R-460; Rejoinder, para. 14; *see also* Affidavit of Neil Bellefontaine, paras. 25-28.\n\nWhites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Public Hearing Transcript (\"JRP Hearing Transcript\"), Vol. 5, dated 21 June 2007, pp. 1062-1063, Exhibit R-284.\n\nHearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, pp. 125-127.\n\n131.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent alleges that:\n\nGiven the surrounding biophysical and human environment of the Digby Neck and the sheer magnitude of the Whites Point project, any proponent who had seriously considered the regulatory environment would have known that it was naive to believe that only a \u2018minimal environmental assessment' would be required.51\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 7.\n\n**(b) Whether the Investors were Encouraged to Invest in the Digby Neck Area**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Investors allege that Nova Scotia actively solicited industrial-quarry investments.52 More specifically, the Investors submit that the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources encouraged the investment in Digby Neck. Gordon Balser, a minister in the Nova Scotia government, actively supported the project.53\n\nReply, para. 32-33; Memorial, paras. 48-54; Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, paras. 16, 18-19, 22; Witness Statement of William Richard Clayton, paras. 16-17; Dan Kontak, Jarda Dostal and John Greenough, 2006, \"Geology and Volcanology of the Jurassic North Mountain Basalt, Southern Nova Scotia\", p. 112, Exhibit C-6; Witness Statement of John Lizak, paras. 11, 19; Internal Stratigraphy of the Jurassic North Mountain Basalt, Nova Scotia, Dan J.

As the Tribunal heard at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, when the Investors' geological expert visited the region, he was taken on a helicopter ride around potential sites in the region and provided with other \"perks\" that were, in his experience, unusual in that they \"wouldn't happen [on the east coast] U.S\" and impressive to the point where he stated that the access and treatment he received made it \"kind of a dream project\" or the \"gem in the Crown\".54\n\nHearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 237, lines 22-24; p. 255, lines 17-25.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the alleged \"encouragement\" or \"invitation\" to invest in Nova Scotia did not amount to more than standard investment promotion activities, falling far short of any specific inducement or assurance.55 In any event, according to the Respondent, investment promotion activities took place in late 2002 and 2003\u2014after Bilcon had decided to invest.56\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 393.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 393.\n\n135.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, any encouragement that was made would have been made to Nova Stone, the entity that applied for, and was granted, the permit for the 3.9 ha quarry.57 That permit was never transferred to GQP and, as a result, Bilcon was never involved in the 3.9 ha quarry in any way.58\n\nFirst Affidavit of Bob Petrie, para. 15.\n\nHearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, pp. 18-21; Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 145.\n\n**(c) Whether the DFO had Authority to Issue Blasting Conditions**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Investors contend that they applied for a standard quarry permit for the 3.9 ha quarry on the understanding that no Blasting Conditions would be attached.59 According to the Investors, internal correspondence between the NSDEL and the DFO reveals that DFO \"contrived to assert authority over the application on the pretext of the potential effect of blasting on whales\".60\n\nMemorial, paras. 99-100; Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 38; Fax from Danette Daveau to Mark Lowe re Standard Terms and Conditions\u2014Rock Quarry Permit Approval, dated 25 January 2002, Exhibit C-29; Nova Stone Application for Approval, dated 23 April 2002, Exhibit C-30; Approval for the Construction and operation of a Quarry at or near Little River, Digby County in the Province of Nova Scotia, dated 30 April 2002, Exhibit C-31.\n\nMemorial, para. 105.\n\n137.\n\nThe Investors contend that, even though the DFO admitted that there were no genuine concerns about such effects at Whites Point and hence \"no legitimate federal government authority to apply the *Fisheries Act* to restrict blasting at Whites Point on the basis of risk to whales,\" the DFO still imposed blasting conditions.61 The Investors claim that internal departmental correspondence exchanged in relation to the *NWPA* floating dock application shows that the DFO saw \"no real whale concerns in the Whites Point area\".62\n\nMemorial, paras. 106-107.\n\nMemorial, para. 106; Fisheries and Oceans Comments on the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Blasting Protocol, undated, Exhibit C-401; E-mail from Phil Zamora to Norman Cochrane, dated 17 February 2005, Exhibit C-400.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, the Investors maintain that \"[i]t is extraordinary that a federal government department [the DFO] inserted itself into a wholly provincial approval process\".63\n\nReply, para. 45.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that it is common for small quarries to be subjected to conditions.64 Moreover, due to Canada's federal system, it is common for provinces to approach the DFO when a proposed project has the potential to impact either fish or fish habitat. In these cases \"there is no such thing as a purely provincial assessment process\".65 For Nova Scotia to reach out \"for DFO's advice and expertise on blasting activities that had the potential to harm both fish and fish habitat on other Nova Scotia projects\" was, according to the Respondent, standard practice.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 67; First Affidavit of Bob Petrie, paras. 5-6; Nova Scotia Department of the Environment, Pit & Quarry Guidelines, dated May 1999, Exhibit R-74.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 70-71; First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 144.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 71; Nova Scotia Department of the Environment, Pit & Quarry Guidelines, dated May 1999, Exhibit R-74.\n\n140.\n\nThe NSDEL, due to the proximity of the blasting operation to the Digby Neck coastline, raised concerns regarding the effect of the proposed blasting operation on the 3.9 ha quarry on marine mammals in the Bay of Fundy.67 Therefore, \"NSDEL reached out to DFO for advice and input. Specifically, on April 9, 2002 NSDEL's Brad Langille contacted DFO's marine mammals advisor, Jerry Conway, to discuss whether Nova Stone's proposed blasting engaged DFO concerns\".68\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 68; Engineer's Report on the Nova Stone Exporters, Inc.

S. 37 of the *Fisheries Act* expressly authorized the DFO to request reports.72\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 72; E-mail from Brian Jollymore to Bob Petrie, dated 26 April 2002, Exhibit R-86.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 72.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 73-78 (explaining the rationale behind the blasting conditions); Exhibit R-86; Blasting Guidelines, pp. 3-4, Exhibit R-115; First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, paras. 148-149.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 78; *Fisheries Act*, s. 37.\n\n**(d) Whether Nova Stone's Blasting Plans were Inappropriately Disapproved**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Investors maintain that their blasting plans were sufficiently detailed to receive approval to blast.73 In the Investors' view, the real reason for the delay in approval of the plans was a political desire by the provincial and federal authorities to prolong the process as much as possible, and to prevent the project proponent from gathering data that was necessary to its EIS.74 The Investors maintain that internal correspondence shows that the DFO was satisfied with the second blasting plan submitted on 15 October 2002 but subsequently changed its position due to political pressure:\n\nHaving reviewed the blasting plan, Jim Ross, the section head of DFO's Habitat Management Division, wrote to Bob Petrie at NSDEL that the blasting plan \"seems to be within the *Guidelines* \". This conclusion was shared by Dennis Wright, a co-ordinator of Environmental Affairs at DFO's Central and Arctic Region and a co-author of the DFO Guidelines referred to in 10.h.15. Mr. Wright also informed Mr. Ross that the DFO *Guidelines* \"are designed chiefly to protect fish,\" adding \"When we use them for protection of marine mammals, we are really flying by the seat of our pants\". [...] Jerry Conway, a whale specialist at the DFO, wrote to Mr. Ross saying that \"I have no concerns in respect to marine mammal issues in respect to this specific proposal\".75\n\n*See, e.g.,* Engineer's Report on the Nova Stone Exporters, Inc. Quarry, by Robert Balcom, dated 21 March 2002, Exhibit R-79; Letter from Jim Ross to Bob Petrie, dated 30 September 2002, Exhibit R-117.\n\nThe Investors point to excerpts from several communications: \"I have been advised by the Minister's office (Nadine) that we are not to accept a report on the effects of blasting on Marine Mammals as per section (i), item 10 of the NS Approval issued April 30th until such time as the Minister's office has reviewed the application.\" E-mail from Tim Surette to Neil Bellefontaine, dated 26 June 2002, Exhibit C-256. *See also* E-mail from Derek MacDonald's to Stephen Chapman, dated 10 June 2003, Exhibit C-403: \"Although not proceeding with the 3.9 ha operation is arguably the \u2018high road', there is no clear legal impediment to its operation. A cynical view might be that DFO wants to avoid making a decision on the blasting plan and the Agency is a convenient scapegoat. The proponent is clearly frustrated, and with good reason, I think. I find it frustrating and it's not even my money.\"\n\nReply, paras. 48-50 (internal citations omitted); Action Log Report re Whites Cover-Quarry Construction, p. 005554, Exhibit C-675. *See also* Testimony of Neil Bellefontaine, Hearing Transcript, 28 October 2013, p. 274, lines 23-24.\n\n143.\n\nOn 3 December 2003, \"the Minister of NSDEL, the Honourable Kerry Morash, wrote to Bilcon assuring it that a blasting permit would be issued upon satisfying conditions [the \"Blasting Conditions\"].\"76 No such permit was ever issued. The Investors assert that DFO withheld necessary information that GQP required for the blasting permit.\n\nReply, para. 67; Letter from Kerry Morash to Paul Buxton, dated 3 December 2003, Exhibit C-617.\n\n144.\n\nIt is the Investors' position, therefore, that the Respondent deliberately delayed test blasting for 15 months,77 to deprive Bilcon of the opportunity to collect blasting data that were a necessary input for the EIS.78 In the meantime, the Respondent imposed overly onerous conditions in the form of an excessive setback distance79 for blasting for which the DFO refused to give any justification and, moreover, concealed from the Investors after confirming that the setback was in fact excessive.80\n\nMemorial, paras. 176-184; Letter from Paul Buxton to Derek McDonald, dated 20 April 2003, requesting approval to conduct test blasting on the 3.9 ha test quarry, Exhibit C-128.\n\nMemorial, para. 182; Journal note by Bruce Hood, dated 26 October 2005, p. 801579, Exhibit C-330.\n\nE-mail from Larry Marshall to Peter Amiro and Rod Bradford, dated 23 May 2003, Exhibit C-129.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 67, lines 8-25 (citing testimony and exhibits).\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was only Nova Stone's third blasting plan of November 2002, submitted more than seven months after the issuance of the industrial approval that was sufficiently detailed for governmental review to commence. The delay due to the inadequacy of the two earlier blasting plans was, in the Respondent's view, Nova Stone's responsibility.81\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 82-90; E-mail exchange between Paul Buxton and Dr. Paul Brodie, dated 3 June 2002, Exhibit R-300; Report of Dr. Paul Brodie re: Proposed blasting activity at Whites Point, dated 19 June 2002, Exhibit R-301; E-mail from Brian Jollymore to Bob Petrie, dated 26 April 2002, Exhibit R-86 (noting that the Second Application is for a quarry of less than 4 ha, but that \"the company intends to get much larger\"; expressing concern as to the possible effects of blasting on marine animals; and requesting that conditions 10.h and 10.i be added to the approval).\n\n146.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Nova Stone's first blasting plan of 17 September 2002 omitted the issue of marine mammals altogether.82 It was silent on the issue even though Nova Stone's own expert, Dr. Paul Brodie, had raised concerns regarding the impact of the quarry on marine mammals and examined possible steps to mitigate such impact.83 On 30 September 2002, noting \"insufficient detail\" in the second blasting plan, the DFO requested the \"additional information that Nova Stone should have provided under the Blasting Guidelines\".84\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 86; Blasting Guidelines, Application Procedure, p. 8, Exhibit R-115.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 83; E-mail exchange between Paul Buxton and Dr. Paul Brodie, dated 3 June 2002, Exhibit R-300.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 86; Letter from Jim Ross to Bob Petrie, dated 30 September 2002, Exhibit R-117.\n\n147.\n\nOn 15 October 2002, Nova Stone filed an additional one-page document regarding its blasting plan, again without information regarding the potential impact of blasting on marine mammals. On 30 October 2002, the DFO provided Nova Stone with further information about necessary components to the blasting plan, noting that this information was required before the plan could undergo internal review within DFO.85\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 87; Letter from Paul Buxton to Bob Petrie, dated 8 October 2002, received by NSDEL on 15 October 2002, Exhibit R-118; Letter from Jim Ross to Bob Petrie, dated 30 October 2002, Exhibit R-119.\n\n148.\n\nOn 20 November 2002, Nova Stone submitted a third, more detailed, blasting plan. DFO review commenced immediately, according to the Respondent. \"However... by the time the plan was submitted, GQP had already taken steps that triggered an EA of the Whites Point project, which subsumed the 3.9 ha quarry. As such, the outcome of DFO's review of the 3.9 ha quarry blasting plan became tied to the determinations that had to be made in connection with the EA of the Whites Point project\".86\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 90; Letter from Paul Buxton to Bob Petrie, dated 20 November 2002, attaching \"Whites Point Quarry Blasting Plan\", dated 18 November 2002, Exhibit R-80.\n\n149.\n\nThe conditional industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry was obtained before the EA of the Whites Point project was under way.87 GQP could have still obtained a blasting permit for the 3.9 ha quarry, if the blasting plan had been appropriately modified and limited to gathering data for the EA. Based on Mr. Buxton's response to a request for information, the \"proposed blasting on the 3.9 ha quarry was to be used to commence quarry operations and construct infrastructure for the larger project (which subsumed the 3.9 ha quarry and was now under EA)\".88\n\nRejoinder, para. 20; Nova Stone Approval to Construct and Operate a quarry near Little River, Digby County, dated 30 April 2002, Exhibit R-87; Whites Point Quarry\u2014Project Description, faxed from Paul Buxton to Helen MacPhail, dated 30 September 2002, Exhibit R-129.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 129; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 29 May 2003, Exhibit R-55.\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the DFO remained open to allowing a test blast on the 3.9 ha quarry site, as test blasts for the purpose of gathering data for an EA are not considered to \"enable a project to proceed in whole or in part\". However, Nova Stone never took steps to redesign the blasting plan as suggested by the DFO. Nor did it ever agree to limit blasting on the 3.9 ha quarry for the generation of data for the EA process. Further, neither Nova Stone, nor GQP, nor Bilcon, ever submitted a blasting plan describing a test blast or requesting a *Fisheries Act* authorization in connection with the impacts that a test blast might have on fish or fish habitat.89\n\nThe Investors did not need a permit to test blast, *see* Hearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 136, lines 10-18, 19-24.\n\n151.\n\nAs for the setback distance, the Respondent maintains that the DFO calculated setback distances for Nova Stone's quarry out of a bona fide concern over the potential impacts of the blasting activity on endangered salmon and whales.90 It emphasizes that the setback affected only Nova Stone, not any of the claimants in these proceedings.91 The Respondent further attributes the lack of DFO communication, which it acknowledges, to the Investors' \"fragmented\" approach to seeking regulatory approval.92 The Respondent further notes that Mr. Mark McLean and Mr. Stephen Chapman testified that by the time DFO determined a revised setback might be feasible, the project was already under the review of the JRP.93\n\nRejoinder, para. 125; First Affidavit of Mark McLean, paras. 21, 40; E-mail from Peter Amiro to Phil Zamora, dated 27 May 2003, Exhibit R-150; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 29 May 2003, Exhibit R-55.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 147, lines 10-12.\n\nRejoinder, para. 127; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 29 May 2003, Exhibit R-55.\n\nSecond Affidavit of Mark McLean, paras. 4-5; Second Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, para. 4.\n\n**B. DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT LEADING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Parties agree that, under s. 5 of the *CEAA*, industrial activity that affects rivers and oceans which are habitat for fish and marine life generally comes under federal legislative authority; put differently, and more specifically, the federal legislation sets out that a EA is required where the responsible federal authority concludes that a project poses a risk of destruction of fish, disruption of fish habitat, or a danger to marine life owing to work in navigable waters.94 These three potentialities are referred to as \"triggers\" for a federal EA. Industrial activity on land generally comes under provincial authority; there, a provincial authority may also conclude there is a need for an EA.95\n\nMemorial, para. 65.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *NSEA*, s. 31(1).\n\n153.\n\nBetween August 2002 and March 2003, GQP went through three rounds of filing project descriptions with NSDEL that would be used for an EA of the intended project.96 The final, accepted description included project infrastructure that consisted of a 152 ha quarry and a 170 m long marine terminal.97\n\nThe Investors refer to both 9 August 2002 and 30 September 2002 as the relevant date of the project description; *see* Memorial, para. 113, n.98; Fax from Paul Buxton to Helen MacPhail, dated 9 August 2002, attaching a Draft Whites Point Quarry Project Description List entitled \"Environmental Component Outline\", Exhibit C-47; Draft WPQ Project Description, dated 30 September 2002, Exhibit C-48.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 13; Letter from Paul Buxton to Derek McDonald, copied to Christopher Daly, attaching third project description, dated 10 March 2003, Exhibit R-181.\n\n154.\n\nWhile the project description exchange was ongoing with the Nova Scotia authority, on 8 January 2003, GQP filed a Navigable Waters Protection Application with the Canadian Coast Guard related to the building of the marine terminal at Whites Point. On 17 February 2003, the Coast Guard determined that GQP's marine terminal required a permit under the *NWPA* which triggered a federal EA.\n\n155.\n\nIn addition, on 7 April 2003, the DFO determined that the Whites Point project as described in its third project description submitted to NSDEL required a so-called HADD authorization under s. 35(2) of the *Fisheries Act* which is also a federal trigger for an EA. On 14 April 2003, the DFO advised GQP that the scope of the project for its EA purposes would include both the quarry and marine terminal.\n\n156.\n\nOnce it is determined that a federal EA is required, the *CEAA* sets out factors for deciding the type of EA to be applied to the project. Relevant to the Whites Point project are the following determinations: (1) whether the project is included in the \"Comprehensive Study List Regulations\"; (2) the project's potential for \"significant adverse environmental effects\"; and (3) the \"public concerns\" associated with the project.98\n\n*CEAA*, ss. 20(1)(c), 23(b), 25 and 28.\n\n157.\n\nOn 20 June 2003, the DFO and the NSDEL agreed to conduct a joint EA of the Whites Point project by way of a JRP. On 26 June 2003, Minister Thibault wrote to the federal Minister of the Environment, David Anderson, recommending that the Whites Point project be referred to a JRP. On 7 August 2003, Minister Anderson referred the Whites Point project to a JRP.\n\n**2. Disputed Facts**\n---------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Parties differ on the following points: whether there was a sufficient basis to refer the project to a JRP; whether the Investors were led to believe that the EA would take the form of a comprehensive study and not a JRP; whether the scope of the EA was unnecessarily broad.\n\n**(a) Whether There Was Sufficient Basis to Refer the Project to a JRP**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Investors take issue with the commencement of the EA for the Whites Point project in two principal respects. First, they maintain that Nova Scotia could only commence an EA of a quarry larger than four ha if they registered the Whites Point project as required under the *NSEA* ; thus, in their view, commencing the EA process was beyond the authority of the provincial government as the preliminary registration process was not carried out for the larger quarry until 2006 (the 3.9 ha quarry was exempt).99\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 12, lines 1-7; Testimony of Bob Petrie, Hearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 36, lines 21-25, p. 40, lines 5-14, pp. 46-47, lines 25-3.\n\n160.\n\nSecondly, the Investors dispute the federal government's \"trigger\" to carry out a federal EA. The Investors claim that the DFO had acknowledged to the NSDEL that it did not have any legislative basis to require an environmental assessment of the quarry under the *CEAA*.100 They maintain that the DFO \"contrived internally\" to create another pretext for carrying out an EA in the context of the *NWPA* application by determining that the dock was designed to handle vessels larger than 25,000 DWT [deadweight tonnage].101\n\nMemorial, paras. 108-109. *See also* Proponent's Guide to Environmental Assessment, Nova Scotia Environment and Labour, s. 5.1, p.14, Exhibit R-163.\n\nE-mail from NSDEL to DFO, dated 16 January 2003, Exhibit C-46.\n\n161.\n\nEven accepting that a federal EA was needed, the Investors note the rarity of JRPs as the adopted method for the EA and argue that their project did not fall within the small category of projects requiring JRP review. The Investors submit that there was insufficient evidence for the EA to take the form of a JRP as \"there was no empirical evidence of any public concern\" regarding the Whites Point project nor did the environmental impact of the project rise to the level of other projects subjected only to a comprehensive study.102\n\nMemorial, para. 137, n.134; Memorandum to Deputy Minister prepared by Barry Jeffrey, dated 17 April 2007, Exhibit C-69; Briefing note approved by Peter Sylvester, dated 19 October 2007, Exhibit C-70; Executive Summary, JRP Report, 22 October 2007, Exhibit C-71.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent underscores that the Whites Point project would, at a minimum, have had to undergone a comprehensive study EA under federal legislation.103 It asserts that the project had attracted considerable scrutiny since its inception, and not just from those living in the Digby Neck area, but also from the people of Nova Scotia more generally.104 It contends that there was a \"persistent flow of letters of concerns sent to both the federal and provincial governments\"105 between July 2002 and October 2003. Many voiced criticism of the Whites Point project in the Community Liaison Committee that was established as part of a public information program under the conditional approval for the 3.9 ha quarry obtained by Nova Stone and in the months leading up to DFO's determination regarding the appropriate type of assessment to be used in March and May 2003. These events showed the DFO \"how engaged and opposed the local community was to the project\",106 precipitating the decision to carry out a JRP.\n\n*CEAA Comprehensive Study List Regulations*, SOR/94-638, Exhibit C-265. *See also* Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 14 April 2003, Exhibit R-54; Counter-Memorial, para. 133.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 143.

The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Investors contend that the DFO led them to believe that the type of EA would be a comprehensive study109 and that federal officials \"were manoeuvring behind the scenes to elevate the quarry proposal into a JRP\".110 They argue that \"political considerations affected the actions of officials involved in what was supposed to be an empirical process\".111\n\nReply, para. 63; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 14 April 2003, Exhibit C-28.\n\nReply, para. 68. *See also* Reply, para. 663.

It also advised the ADM that it had \u2018yet to be determined' whether both projects would be scoped together, even though by this time it had already told Bilcon it would do so\".115\n\nMemorial, para. 130; Journal note by Bruce Hood, dated 12 May 2003, p. 801615.

In this context, the Investors highlight the following statements in Mr. Hood's journal notes: \"Minister sensitive because [it's] in his riding\",118 and that the DFO knew it \"had no trigger for [the] quarry\". According to the Investors, Mr. Hood's journal notes demonstrate \"that political pressure was being put on the DFO by the CEA Agency and by the Province of Nova Scotia, to include the quarry within a federal environmental assessment\".119\n\nMemorial, para. 126; Journal note by Bruce Hood, disclosing a statement made by Minister Robert Thibault evidencing his use of powers to lengthen the environmental assessment of the Whites Point Quarry, undated, p. 801619, Exhibit C-370.\n\nMemorial, para. 132; Journal note by Bruce Hood, undated, p. 801641, Exhibit C-381; Journal note by Bruce Hood, undated, p. 801639, Exhibit C-382.\n\nMemorial, para. 120; Journal note by Bruce Hood, noting that the DFO did not possess a valid legislative trigger which would provide jurisdiction to include the quarry within the federal environmental assessment, dated Fall 2007, p. 801603, Exhibit C-365.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent contends that at no point were GQP or Bilcon misled about the EA's likely character. It is the Respondent's position that government officials were consistent in advising the Investors that, given the nature of their project and the environment for which it was proposed, it could be referred to a review panel.120\n\nRejoinder, para. 31; Christopher Daly's notes of 6 January 2003 meeting with GQP, Exhibit R-178; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 14 April 2003, Exhibit R-54.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, due to the presence of the marine terminal as an integral part of the Whites Point project, officials concluded early on that the project would require at a minimum a comprehensive study.121 However, this determination was just a starting point:\n\nFrom the time of their review of GQP's first rudimentary project description, government officials believed that these statutory grounds were likely to be engaged by this project. In particular, DFO officials commented early on that \"given the level of public concern, potential for numerous federal *CEAA* triggers and environmental issues as well as the size, extent and duration of the overall project a Panel Review may be warranted\". They even discussed this possibility with GQP representatives at their January 6, 2003 meeting.122\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 133-134; Exhibit R-54.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 134 (internal citations omitted).\n\n172.\n\nThe NSDEL first met with GQP on 14 June 2002123 and there advised GQP that the project would require a provincial EA and might also require a federal EA. A second meeting took place on 25 July 2002. The Respondent maintains that federal and provincial officials notified GQP that public concerns had already been raised and that DFO took public consultation \"very seriously\". It is the Respondent's position that there is no evidence that any representative of the Investors took issue with the potential approaches to an EA laid out by DFO.124\n\nThe Investors do not expressly dispute that this meeting took place. They do not refer to this meeting in their Memorial, Reply or their Timeline of Relevant Facts of 17 May 2013.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 94.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent expressly rejects the Investors' interpretation of the content of the 6 January 2003 meeting: \"The Claimants' assertion in their Memorial... that it was \u2018agreed' at the January 6, 2003 meeting that the type of EA would be a \u2018comprehensive study' is, thus, demonstrably wrong\".125 According to the Respondent's account of this meeting with GQP on 6 January 2003, it informed GQP that a JRP remained a possibility:\n\n... As to the type of EA that would be used, officials advised GQP that while \"comp study is more than likely\" there was \"possibility of a panel\" in light of the \"likely significant effects\" and \"public concerns\" being voiced over the project. So that a decision could be made on the type of assessment, officials requested GQP to submit a more thorough project description.126\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 134, n.293; Christopher Daly's Notes of 6 January 2003 meeting with GQP, Exhibit R-178.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 101; Christopher Daly's notes of 6 January 2003 meeting with GQP, Exhibit R-178; Lorilee Langille's notes of 6 January 2003 meeting with GQP, Exhibit R-132. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 134; E-mail from Reg Sweeney to Jim Ross and Thomas Wheaton, dated 4 December 2002, Exhibit R-130.\n\n174.\n\nOn 31 March 2003, an intergovernmental working group considered the third project description. Participants agreed in principle to harmonize the required federal and provincial EAs. A comprehensive study was considered to be \"the most likely federal EA track\" but participants recognize that public reaction \"may influence [the] EA track decision\".127 At this meeting, the possibility of referral to the JRP remained on the horizon:\n\na \"Highlights and Action Items\" summary prepared after the meeting acknowledged the possibility that the project could be referred to a review panel, indicating that \"Comprehensive Study is the most likely federal EA track\" but that \"[p]ublic reaction to Scope and MOU may influence EA track decision\". Mark McLean's notes of this meeting also indicate that \"public review/concerns can bump CSR [Comprehensive Study Review] to panel\" and \"will be challenged on decision on comp study,\" implicitly acknowledging the public concerns that could warrant referral to a panel.128\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136; Highlights and Action Items Whites Point Inter-Agency EA Meeting, dated 31 March 2003, Exhibit R-145.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136 (internal citations omitted).

In this letter, DFO stated \"that because of the size of the marine terminal \u2018the type of screening used for the EA will therefore be a \u2018comprehensive study'\". However, it was made clear in the letter that \"although the type of assessment being used for this project is a \u2018comprehensive study', *CEAA* (s. 23) includes the provision that the project could be referred to a mediator or review panel\".129\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 137; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 14 April 2003, Exhibit R-54.\n\n176.\n\nIn May 2003, DFO officials reached a decision to recommend that the Whites Point project be referred to a JRP on the basis that the statutory criteria had been satisfied.130 On 20 June 2013 the NSDEL confirmed that Nova Scotia was interested in participating in a JRP of the project.131 The Respondent describes the chain of events as follows:\n\nOnce Nova Scotia confirmed its interest, DFO officials prepared a briefing note for decision to DFO Minister Thibault, recommending that he refer the project to the Minister of the Environment for referral to a review panel. This was the first decision DFO officials had requested from their Minister in the context of the Whites Point EA. Over the course of the previous ten months, DFO officials had provided him with informational briefings to keep him and his office advised on the matter. Given that Minister Thibault was the Member of Parliament for Southwest Nova (which includes the Digby Neck), it is not surprising that he was interested in the proposal. However, as both Minister Thibault and Neil Bellefontaine make clear, the determinations made by DFO officials were their own, and Minister Thibault did not in any way interfere in the work of officials, or otherwise direct or instruct them in their work. The only guidance that the Minister ever offered was that the EA process used to review the Whites Point project would \"need to ensure public concerns over the project were adequately heard and addressed\" and that it was to be \"a full and fair comprehensive environmental assessment of the proposal that strictly complied with the rules, did not cut any corners and allowed the public to have a voice\".132\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 146; Affidavit of Neil Bellefontaine, para. 40; Memorandum for the Assistant Deputy Minister, Oceans\u2014Environmental Assessment of Proposed Quarry and Shipping Terminal, Whites Cove Digby County, Nova Scotia Pre-Meeting for Meeting with Associate Deputy Minister, dated 26 May 2003, Exhibit R-69.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 148; Letter from Paul Boudreau to Christopher Daly, dated 20 June 2003, Exhibit R-70; Letter from Christopher Daly to Paul Boudreau, dated 20 June 2003, Exhibit R-71.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 149 (internal citations omitted).\n\n177.\n\nMinister Thibault explains that he was convinced that the overwhelming amount of public concern that had been expressed over the project, as well as the significant environmental concerns associated with it, more than justified a referral to a review panel.\n\n**(c) Whether the Scope of the EA Was Overly Broad**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Investors assert that the scope required for their EA was unnecessarily broad. They argue that the quarry was included in the assessment for purely political reasons.133 As noted above, a trigger is required to activate the jurisdiction of the federal government over the environmental aspects of a certain project. According to the Investors, as late as 2007, government officials admitted that the DFO had no trigger for the quarry.134 Correspondence among and notes of government officials suggest that the scope of the EA had been politicized.135\n\nBut *see* Memorandum for the Assistant Deputy Minister of Oceans, \"Environmental Assessment of Proposed Quarry\" and Shipping Terminal, Whites Cove, Digby County, Nova Scotia Pre-Meeting for Meeting with Associate Deputy Minister\", Exhibit C-509: \"... the proposed project has been very controversial and the Province is therefore anxious to have federal involvement with assessment of both the terminal and quarry... DFO has determined that the marine terminal will require *CEAA* assessment, however, it has yet to be determined if there is a trigger for assessment of the quarry. It is likely, due to public opposition of the proposal that there will be a court challenge if the scope of project for the *CEAA* assessment does not include both the quarry and the terminal.\"\n\nJournal note by Bruce Hood, noting that the DFO did not possess a valid legislative trigger which would provide jurisdiction to include the quarry within the federal environmental assessment, undated, p. 801603, Exhibit C-365.\n\nJournal note by Bruce Hood, noting that the public would be upset if the quarry was not included in the scope of the DFO's assessment, dated Fall 2007, p. 801604, Exhibit C-366 (\"[T]he public will likely be mad if DFO doesn't scope in [the] quarry\"); Journal note by Bruce Hood, dated 25 April 2003, p. 801610, Exhibit C-284 (\"Every time we scope broadly to accommodate someone else we get screwed. We want to get our Minister off this file\"); Journal note by Bruce Hood, undated, p. 801619, Exhibit C-380 (\"don't mention scoping... don't send up note\").\n\n179.\n\nThe Investors assert that DFO's practice at the time had been to \"scope to the trigger\" and not beyond, meaning that the only elements of a project that would be included in any EA would be the piece(s) that triggered federal oversight and nothing further.136 For their project, however, the Investors maintain that the evidence demonstrates collusion between the federal and provincial authorities to go beyond the trigger of the marine terminal and to drag out the process as long as possible.137\n\n*See, e.g.,* E-mail from Bruce Hood to Reg Sweeney, dated 9 December 2003, Exhibit C-62: \"[b]ased on our present practice of project scoping to DFO legislative authority.\" The Investors also rely on the Mining Watch case, *Mining Watch Canada v. Canada* (Fisheries and Oceans), 2010 SCC 2, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 6.\n\nThe Investors highlight the following excerpts from the Journal note by Bruce Hood: \"Thibault wants this process dragged out as long as possible.\" Journal note by Bruce Hood, dated Fall 2007, p. 801619, Exhibit C-370; \"Minister sensitive because it's his riding\"; \"flood of Ministers letters\". Journal note by Bruce Hood, undated, p. 801641, Exhibit C-381.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that under Nova Scotia law, a quarry in excess of 4 ha requires approval of the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour which in turn requires that an EA must be conducted in accordance with Nova Scotia law.138 Thus, an EA would have to be conducted of the quarry regardless of the Investors' assertions that the *federal* government did not have a trigger in the quarry. According to the Respondent, because the federal and provincial officials decided to harmonize their EAs,139 this meant the scope would have to include both the quarry and the marine terminal.\n\nFirst Affidavit of Christopher Daly, paras. 4, 7-17; *NSEA*, ss. 31-32.\n\nConsistent with the *CEAA* 's purpose of eliminating unnecessary duplication the EA process, *see CEAA*, s. 4(b.1).\n\n181.\n\nIn any event, there was nothing improper in the Respondent's view of the manner through which the DFO asserted its oversight over the quarry component in the context of the EA.140 The Respondent observes that under *CEAA*, s. 15, the \"scope of project\" can include components of a project or projects in addition to those that triggered the *CEAA* in the first place.141 It notes that all officials involved in the reviewing process concluded that the scope of the project should include both the marine terminal and the quarry, and that GQP never challenged that determination.142\n\nThe Respondent notes that in respect of the hearing on jurisdiction and merits in these proceedings, the Investors chose not to cross-examine Minister Thibault who said in his then unchallenged witness statement that the issues surrounding approval of the Whites Point project were not political.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 55; *CEAA*, s. 15. *See also* Expert Report of Robert Connelly, paras. 42-44.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 117; First Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, paras. 15-18; Affidavit of Neil Bellefontaine, paras. 29-34; Affidavit of Mark McLean, paras. 36-38; Affidavit of Bruce Hood, paras. 11-17.\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that this decision was made for several reasons: First, the two elements were interdependent, even as presented by the proponent, and therefore should have been considered together for that reason.143 Secondly, the DFO had determined that the quarry might require authorization under the *Fisheries Act* so it was prudent to include it; in fact, DFO concluded in May 2003 that the proposed blasting at the 3.9 ha quarry would require authorization under the *Fisheries Act*, triggering an EA.144 The Respondent comments that the Investors' assertion that \"DFO acknowledged the lack of a trigger for the quarry\"145 identifies correspondence exemplifying an \"academic discussion\" occurring before any visit to the site.146\n\nBruce Hood Notes, dated March-June 2003, pp. 801602-801604, Exhibit R-260: \"if we don't scope in the quarry, [we will be] contrary to the advice of [the] Agency and EA practices.\" *See also* E-mail from Brian Jollymore to Brad Langille, dated 22 April 2002, Exhibit C-38: \"I would like to add.

We are legislated to follow the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Under that piece of legislation, project splitting for review purposes is not permitted. The wharf would be required by the quarry.

THE ESTABLISHMENT AND WORK OF THE JRP**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe federal Minister of the Environment and the provincial Minister of the NSDEL released a draft JRP Agreement and the JRP's Terms of Reference (\"TOR\") for public comment on 11 August 2003. The final JRP Agreement and associated TOR were signed on 29 October and 3 November 2004 respectively.\n\n184.\n\nOn 5 November 2004, the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of the NSDEL jointly announced the establishment of the JRP and the appointment of the panellists: Dr. Robert Fournier (as chair), Dr. Gunter Muecke and Dr. Jill Grant. Dr. Fournier is a professor of oceanography at Dalhousie University; he had prior experience as chair of another JRP. Dr. Muecke is a professor emeritus of geochemistry, geology and environmental studies at Dalhousie University. Dr. Grant is a professor at the School of Planning at Dalhousie University.\n\n185.\n\nOn 10 November 2004, the CEA Agency and the NSDEL released draft EIS guidelines for public comment (the \"draft EIS Guidelines\"). After the JRP held four public scoping meetings on the draft EIS Guidelines in four different locations in southwest Nova Scotia from 6 to 9 January 2005, Bilcon submitted its comments on the draft EIS Guidelines. In total, the CEA Agency received 148 public submissions. On 31 March 2005, the JRP issued the final EIS guidelines (the \"EIS Guidelines\").\n\n186.\n\nOn 26 April 2006, thirteen months after the issuance of the EIS Guidelines, Bilcon submitted its EIS to the JRP. A day later, the JRP invited the public and the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia to comment on Bilcon's EIS. Between June and July 2006, the JRP issued two sets of comments and information requests to Bilcon in relation to the EIS. By 11 August 2006, the closing date for comments by the public on Bilcon's EIS, the JRP had received about 250 comments.\n\n187.\n\nBetween August 2006 and April 2007, Bilcon submitted its responses to the JRP's information requests and public comments. On 1 May 2007, the JRP announced two weeks of public hearings in Digby, Nova Scotia, commencing on 16 June 2007.\n\n188.\n\nThe JRP held public hearings between 16 and 30 June 2007. On 22 October 2007, the JRP submitted its report to the federal Minister of the Environment and the Minister of the NSDEL, recommending that the Whites Point project not be permitted to proceed (the \"JRP Report\"). Specifically, the JRP concluded and recommended:\n\n1. The Panel recommends that the Minister of Environment and Labour (Nova Scotia) reject the proposal made by Bilcon of Nova Scotia to create the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal and recommends to the Government of Canada that the Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects that, in the opinion of the Panel, cannot be justified in the circumstances.\n\n2. The Panel recommends that the Province of Nova Scotia develop and implement a comprehensive coastal zone management policy or plan for the Province.\n\n3. Because of the special issues associated with coastal quarries, the Panel recommends a moratorium on new approvals for development along the North Mountain until the Province of Nova Scotia has thoroughly reviewed this type of initiative within the context of a comprehensive provincial coastal zone management policy and established appropriate guidelines to facilitate decision-making.\n\n4. The Panel recommends that the Province of Nova Scotia develop and implement more effective mechanisms than those currently in place for consultation with local governments, communities and proponents in considering applications for quarry developments.\n\n5. The Panel recommends that the Province of Nova Scotia modify its regulations to require an environmental assessment of quarry projects of any size.\n\n6. The Panel recommends that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency develop a guidance document on the application of adaptive management in environmental assessments and in environmental management following approvals.\n\n7. The Panel recommends that Transport Canada revise its ballast water regulations to ensure that ships transporting goods from waters with known risks take appropriate measures to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of unwanted species.147\n\nExecutive Summary, JRP Report, 22 October 2007, pp. 4-5, Exhibit C-71.\n\n189.\n\nOn 23 October 2007,148 the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia released the JRP Report to the public.\n\nThe Investors state in their Memorial that this release to the public occurred on 26 October (Memorial, para. 239) but the Reply refers to 23 October (Reply, para. 129, referring to News Article, headed Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia Release Findings of the Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, dated 23 October 2007, Exhibit C-651), which is the same date stated in the Respondent's Timeline of Relevant Facts, dated 17 May 2013, p. 9.\n\n**2. Disputed Facts**\n---------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the following issues: when the Investors were notified of the referral of the Whites Point project to a JRP; whether the appointment of the JRP members was fair; whether the Scoping Meetings, the EIS Guidelines and the JRP's considerations conformed to statutory requirements and the TOR; whether the Investors were unresponsive and acted unprofessionally in responding to requests for information, drawing out the EA; whether the hearing held before the JRP was conducted fairly and impartially; whether the JRP unlawfully recommended rejection of the project under the *CEAA* ; and whether the local community support for the Whites Point project was indeed extensive.\n\n**(a) When the Investors Were Notified of the Referral to the JRP**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Investors take issue with being formally notified of the decision to refer the project to a JRP only on 10 September 2004,149 a month after the federal Minister of the Environment had taken it.\n\nReply, para. 65; *see also* Memorial, paras. 139, 142. The Investors' Timeline of Relevant Facts (dated 17 May 2013) mistakenly refers to 10 September 2003.\n\n192.\n\nAccording to the Investors, Bilcon only learned about the referral to a JRP when Mr. Buxton read about it in the Halifax *Chronicle Herald* on 7 July 2003. On 28 August 2003, Mr. Buxton met with representatives of the CEA Agency, the DFO and the NSDEL. When Bilcon asked why it had not been informed about the referral of the project to a JRP, Mr. Chapman, the CEA Agency Project Manager, told him that the recommendation process was not public.150\n\nMemorial, para. 140; Letter from Stephen Chapman to Paul Buxton, regarding the environmental assessment process, dated 10 September 2003, Exhibit C-75. The Respondent states that this meeting occurred on 29 August 2003; *see* Respondent's Timeline of Relevant Facts, p. 6.\n\n193.\n\nThe Investors maintain that, when the federal Ministry of the Environment and the NSDEL released the draft JRP Agreement and the draft TOR for public comments on 11 August 2003, Bilcon had yet to be: a) officially informed that the Project had been referred to a JRP; b) told of why the project had been elevated from a Comprehensive Study to a JRP; and c) told how it could comply with conditions that DFO itself had laid down for a separate quarry and that, without consultation, was being merged into the larger quarry.151\n\nReply, para. 79.\n\n194.\n\nThe Investors also maintain that \"despite its repeated requests, Bilcon was never informed of when, how, or why, the referral was accepted by the Minister of Environment\".152\n\nMemorial, para. 142; Letter from Stephen Chapman to Paul Buxton, dated 10 September 2003, Exhibit C-75.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that GQP was officially informed of the JRP Agreement and the TOR on 29 August 2003, when federal and provincial officials met with GQP \"to discuss the JRP process and to invite comments on the draft JRP Agreement and Terms of Reference\". Having received no comments, the Agency on 10 September 2003 asked the GQP again for input. Yet GQP once again remained silent.153 On 11 November 2003, \"Mr. Buxton advised NSDEL that GQP \u2018regarded the Draft Memorandum of Understanding as a reasonable document and hence did not feel the need for comment.' Mr. Buxton added that \u2018[t]he fact that we did not comment should not be construed as a blanket endorsement of the document or of the fact that a Panel Review is required for this project.'\"154\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 155; Letter from Stephen Chapman to Paul Buxton, dated 10 September 2003, Exhibit R-228; First Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, para. 32.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 156 (referring to a Letter from Paul Buxton to Christopher Daly, dated 11 November 2003, Exhibit R-229, and stating at n.349 that \"[a]lthough Mr. Buxton erroneously refers to a \u2018Draft Memorandum of Understanding,' it is clear his comment concerns the draft JRP Agreement and Terms of Reference.\").\n\n**(b) Whether the Appointment of the JRP Members was Fair**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Investors allege that the JRP lacked diversity, as all three members were \"environmental activists, all from the same university\".155 The CEA Agency \"was aware that Robert Fournier and Gunter Muecke had both been Board Members of the Ecology Action Centre, a selfdescribed environmental activist organization\".156 According to the Investors, \"it was a notorious public fact that the Ecology Action Centre was an active and vocal opponent of the quarry\".157 The Investors further refer to the following facts:\n\nIn 2002, the Faculty of Planning and Architecture of Dalhousie University, where Jill Grant was employed, together with the same Ecology Action Centre, organized a three-day conference that advocated for the \"greening\" of Nova Scotia. Jill Grant was a moderator at the Conference.\n\nQuestion 8 of the CEA Agency's Panel Interview Questions, specifically asked potential panelists to address real, potential or perceived conflicts of interest. The candidates' answers have not been disclosed.158\n\nMemorial, para. 157.\n\nMemorial, para. 151; R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Robert Fournier, Exhibit C-285; R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Gunter Muecke, Exhibit C-286.\n\nMemorial, para. 152; JRP Hearing Transcript, Vol. 10, dated 27 June 2007, p. 2459, Exhibit C-109.\n\nMemorial, paras. 153-154; Whites Point Quarry: Panel Members\u2014Interviews, dated 20 August 2004, Exhibit C-110.\n\n197.\n\nThe Investors further submit that the CEA Agency rejected another candidate who was a professional engineer in Nova Scotia with over thirty years of professional experience with natural resource management and environmental planning.159 According to the Investors, in \"internal e-mails the CEA Agency concluded that [this other candidate] was \u2018bright and had a wealth of experience', \u2018but may be too much in favor of industry'\".160\n\nMemorial, para. 155; Curriculum Vitae of John Amirault, Exhibit C-390.\n\nMemorial, para. 156 (citing an E-mail from Bill Coulter to Jean Crepault, providing opinions on the suitability of John Amirault and Anne Fouillard, dated 19 January 2004, Exhibit C-112).\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that JRP members were selected in accordance with the *CEAA*. JRP members must be \"unbiased and free from any conflict of interest relative to the project and. have knowledge or experience relative to the anticipated environmental effects of the project\".161 According to the Respondent, \"[g]iven the nature of the Whites Point project, officials sought individuals with expertise in marine sciences, geology, mining operations, mineral engineering, and socio-economic studies\".162\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 161, referring to *CEAA*, s. 41(b), and stating that \"[t]he JRP Agreement, which was being negotiated at the time between the Agency and NSDEL, contains an identical requirement at Article 3.3.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 161; First Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, para. 39.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent highlights the credentials of Drs. Fournier, Muecke and Grant and the reasons they were considered suitable for a position as JRP members.163 According to the Respondent, not only did Bilcon not raise any objection to the appointment of the JRP members when informed of their selection before the public announcement, but Mr. Buxton approved of the appointment of those members.164\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 162-165; Affidavit of Christopher Daly, paras. 49, 51; Backgrounder\u2014Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project Joint Review Panel Members Biographical Notes, Exhibit R-313; Curriculum vitae of Dr. Gunter Muecke, Exhibit R-379; Curriculum vitae of Dr. Robert Fournier, Exhibit R-380; Curriculum vitae of Dr. Jill Grant, Exhibit R-381; Questions for Interviewing Review Panel Candidates, Exhibit R-206.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 167; Letter from Minister of the Environment St\u00e9phane Dion to Dr. Robert Fournier, dated 3 November 2004, Exhibit R-208.\n\n**(c) Whether the JRP's Work Conformed to Statutory Requirements and its TOR**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Investors argue that the draft EIS Guidelines and the final EIS Guidelines exceeded the JRP's TOR,165 as well as the legislative framework for the EA, and imposed \"onerous requirements\" on them.166 Specifically, the Investors contend that the scoping meetings conducted by the JRP also focused on issues that were outside the TOR.167\n\nMemorial, para. 163.\n\nMemorial, para. 167; News Release, Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project Joint Review Panel issues final Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines, dated 31 March 2005, Exhibit C-442.\n\nMemorial, paras. 165-166; Part II, para. 2 of the Appendix to Agreement concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel, dated 3 November 2004, Exhibit C-363; Transcript of Scoping Meeting #1 in Sandy Cove, dated 6 January 2005, Exhibit C-116; Transcript of Scoping Meeting #2 in Digby, dated 7 January 2005, Exhibit C-117; Transcript of Scoping Meeting #3 in Wolfville, dated 8 January 2005, Exhibit C-118; E-mail from Phil Zamora to Derek McDonald, regarding the topics and issues discussed by residents of Digby Neck at the Joint Review Panel Scoping Meetings, undated, Exhibit C-441.\n\n201.\n\nThe Investors maintain that the final EIS Guidelines \"departed substantially from the expected scientific and technical focus of an EIS, and also required Bilcon to address non-scientific and non-technical questions\".168 These requirements included a distorted precautionary principle,169 \"the influence of the *NAFTA* and the *Kyoto Protocol* on the Whites Point Quarry\",170 the need to consider traditional knowledge,171 a strong emphasis on sustainable development,172 a more stringent ecosystem analysis approach,173 cumulative effects,174 as well as other improper considerations that influenced the JRP's recommendations,175 such as the precedential impact of approving the Whites Point project on access to the Canadian market under the NAFTA in relation to similar future projects.176\n\nReply, para. 95; Letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 31 March 2005, ss. 9.3.1., 9.3.8., Exhibit C-120.\n\nMemorial, para. 168; Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines for the Review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, dated March 2005, s. 3.5, Exhibit C-168.\n\nMemorial, para. 169; Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines for the Review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, dated March 2005, s. 6.6, Exhibit C-168.\n\nMemorial, para. 170; Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines for the Review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, dated March 2005, s. 3.1, Exhibit C-168.\n\nMemorial, paras. 171-172.\n\nMemorial, para. 173; Exhibit C-169, s. 8.0.\n\nMemorial, para. 173; Exhibit C-168, s. 11.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Reply, paras. 95-96; Letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 31 March 2005, ss. 9.3.1., 9.3.8., 10, Exhibit C-120.\n\nMemorial, paras. 215-223.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the harmonized EA and the EIS Guidelines met the statutory requirements under federal and Nova Scotia law.177 Moreover, the Respondent submits that the \"draft JRP Agreement and Terms of Reference were based on similar agreements and Terms of Reference prepared in other EAs and were consistent with the Agency's 1997 *Procedures for an Assessment by a Review Panel* \".178 Because the purpose of a JRP is to carry out the necessary review for both jurisdictions (federal and provincial), the Whites Point JRP was, according to the Respondent, necessarily mandated to review and assess information pertaining to any and all environmental effects under both the *CEAA* and the *NSEA*.179\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 152-153; Expert Report of Robert Connnelly, paras. 102-105; *see also CEAA*, s. 2. *See also* Rejoinder, paras. 33-37.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 152; Procedures for an Assessment by a Review Panel, dated November 1997, Exhibit R-26.\n\nRejoinder, para. 33; Expert Report of Robert Connelly, paras. 102-104; First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, paras. 132, 230-246.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes in particular that federal law required the EA to evaluate \"\u2018any change that the project may cause in the environment' including \u2018any effect of any change [in the environment]. on health and socio-economic conditions', and \u2018physical and cultural heritage'\".180 Similarly, Nova Scotia law required the EA to take into account \"any change, whether positive or negative, that the undertaking may cause in the environment, including any effect on socio-economic conditions, on environmental health, physical and cultural heritage or on any structure, site or thing\".181 The Respondent comments that the Investors' Expert, Mr. Estrin, acknowledged that as part of an EA in Nova Scotia, the necessary inquiry may include consideration of whether the effects of the project would be consistent with the community's core values.182\n\nRejoinder, para. 34; *CEAA*, s. 2. *See also* Expert Report of Robert Connelly, para. 73 and First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 284.\n\n*NSEA*, s. 3 (v). *See also* First Affidavit of Christopher Daly, para. 5.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 230 (\"inconsistency with community core values... is a pure socio-economic effect\").\n\n204.\n\nAs a result of these statutory requirements, the JRP Agreement signed between Canada and Nova Scotia made reference to the requirements of both the *CEAA* and the *NSEA*, that is, both environmental and socio-economic effects. Likewise the EIS Guidelines sought information on the \"Existing Human Environment\" and on \"Social and Cultural Patterns\".183 The Respondent also submits that GQP and Bilcon raised the respective concerns for the first time in this arbitration, noting again that GQP did not avail itself of the opportunity to comment on the JRP Agreement and the TOR at a meeting held on 29 August 2003 (*see* para. 195 above).\n\nJRP Agreement, para. 6.3; Appendix to the JRP Agreement (Terms of Refrence for the JRP, Part III), Exhibit R-27; EIS Guidelines, p. 45, Exhibit R-210.\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, although the JRP released the draft EIS Guidelines for public comment on 10 November 2004, Bilcon provided no comments on the draft EIS Guidelines at the time.184 On 15 December 2004, the JRP requested Bilcon to review the draft EIS Guidelines and to provide comments. According to the Respondent, Bilcon provided \"cursory\" comments of two-and-a-half pages on the draft EIS Guidelines on 16 January 2005.185 Bilcon's principal comment was a request that the concept of \"adaptive management\" be included in the EIS Guidelines.186 The Respondent emphasizes that Bilcon never registered \"a concern that the draft EIS Guidelines went beyond the scope of the JRP's Terms of Reference\"187 and that Bilcon failed to object to the scope or content of the draft EIS Guidelines.188\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 171; Letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 15 December 2004, Exhibit R-242.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 171-173; Letter from Paul Buxton to Stephen Chapman, dated 16 January 2005, Exhibit R-243.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 173.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 173; First Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, para. 46.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 176. *See also* Letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 31 March 2005, Exhibit R-210.\n\n**(d) Whether the Investors Delayed the Review Process**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\ni.

The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n207.\n\nIn relation to the establishment of the JRP, the Respondent submits that the final JRP Agreement was ready for implementation by February 2004, but that a request by Bilcon, seemingly made without Nova Stone's knowledge, to stay the execution of the agreement pending the restructuring of the GQP partnership caused substantial delay.192 Once the GQP partnership had been dissolved, Bilcon was left as the sole proponent of the Whites Point project.193 As explained in more detail in the arguments on jurisdiction, the Respondent takes the view that under Canadian law, the conditional, and non-transferable industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry became null and void as of the date of GQP's dissolution. Thus, in the Respondent's view, any measures involving the 3.9 ha quarry would have no bearing on the present case for that reason, and also because the permit for the quarry terminated on 1 May 2004, which predates this Tribunal's jurisdiction.194 Bilcon did not apply for a new permit.195\n\nMemorial, paras. 157-159; E-mail from Jean Cr\u00e9pault to Brian Torrie, dated 27 February 2004, wherein Mr. Cr\u00e9pault states that GQP's lawyer contacted him to advise \"that his clients would prefer to sort out this issue of two projects [the 3.9 ha quarry and the larger quarry and marine terminal] and two proponents [Nova Stone and GQP] first before signing the joint review agreement,\" Exhibit R-230; E-mail from Boris de Jonge to Jean Cr\u00e9pault, dated 1 March 2004, Exhibit R-203.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 159; Letter from Paul Buxton to Jean Cr\u00e9pault, dated 13 August 2004, Exhibit R-93.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, pp. 228-229, lines 16-25, 1-15 and pp. 233-234, lines 11-25, 1-12.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 160.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the EIS was finally submitted on 26 April 2006, six months after the date (24 November 2005) indicated by Bilcon.196 According to the Respondent, the delay caused by Bilcon reflects its cavalier approach to the preparation of the EIS and the EA.197 For most of the EA, Bilcon did not retain the services of an expert consulting firm.198 In reviewing the EIS, the JRP discovered \"significant deficiencies\" in substance and form, including Bilcon's failure to follow the EIS Guidelines, as well as \"apparent contradictions\".199\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 180.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 177-178.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 178; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 14 April 2003, Exhibit R-54.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 181; Information Request No. 1 from the JRP to Bilcon, dated 28 June 2006, Exhibit R-250; Letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 28 July 2006, attaching EIS Information Request of 28 July 2006, Exhibit R-219. *See also* Counter-Memorial, paras. 182-188.\n\n209.\n\nAs a result, the JRP requested additional information from Bilcon on 28 June and 28 July 2006. Bilcon again missed its self-imposed deadline, and filed what were, in the Respondent's view, \"piecemeal responses\" up until 12 February 2007.200 The Respondent alleges that Bilcon did not take the EA seriously, regarding it merely as \"hoops to jump through\" and \"a mere licensing process\"201 as reflected in the internal e-mail sent by Mr. Buxton to a colleague stating that they \"need to cobble something together to satisfy the system\".202 Insofar as the Investors now contend that they were misled into thinking it was a purely scientific exercise, the Respondent maintains they were poorly advised by Mr. Buxton, since the legislation expressly lists additional criteria for which they should have been prepared, including socioeconomic considerations. Bilcon's unprofessional behaviour during the course of the EA had a serious impact on the JRP's view of the Whites Point project. In sum, Bilcon's EA was \"ill-prepared\", \"incomplete\", \"raised more questions than answers\" and \"eroded the JRP's confidence \u2018in the conceptual design and associated quantitative underpinnings'\".203\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 186; E-mail from Josephine Lowry to Debra Myles, dated 12 February 2007, Exhibit R-256. *See also* letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 27 February 2007, Exhibit R-252.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 206; CLC Minutes, dated 24 November 2003, p. 234, Exhibit R-299; Presentation of Bilcon to Various Ministers of the Government of Nova Scotia, dated 10 January 2007, p. 12, para. 6, Exhibit R-330.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 187; E-mail from Paul Buxton to Uwe Wittkugel, dated 26 March 2007, Exhibit R-318.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 188; JRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 87, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n**(e) Whether the Hearing Held before the JRP was Conducted Fairly and Impartially**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni.

The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n213.\n\nAccording to the Investors, the JRP Report was \"based on the Panel's subjective views of the Whites Point Quarry\" and not on \"objective environmental factors\".215 The JRP's recommendations included what were, in the Investors' view, six flawed public policy recommendations that exceeded the JRP remit.216 These six recommendations were also \"in themselves fundamentally flawed\".217 The Investors allege that the JRP was bound to base its recommendation exclusively on the \"factors set out in s. 16 of the *CEAA*, and Part IV of the Nova Scotia Environment Act\".218 It was impermissible for the JRP to consider the public interest beyond the requirements explicitly set out in the Act.219 The applicable test was whether the project has a \"major or catastrophic\" adverse environmental effect.220\n\nMemorial, para. 242; First Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 484, 492, 501-502.\n\nMemorial, para. 241; JRP Report, dated October 2007, pp. 104-107, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nReply, para. 135.\n\nMemorial, para. 248; *CEAA*, s. 34; Cl. 6.3 of the Agreement concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel, dated 3 November 2004, p. 5, Exhibit C-114.\n\nReply, para. 142; JRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 4, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nReply, para. 130; SAEE Reference Guide, November 1994, p. 188, Exhibit C-384.\n\n214.\n\nIn failing to address the prerequisite mitigation measures, criticizing Bilcon's adaptive management approach,221 and relying on outside factors (such as public involvement, ecosystem approach, sustainable development, an improperly expansive precautionary principle, community core values and effects on future similar projects under the NAFTA),222 the JRP exceeded its TOR and effectively \"advance[d] its own view of environmental law reform\".223 The Investors take the view that the JRP's report contained numerous errors224 and was aimed at setting environmental policy.225\n\nMemorial, paras. 244 and 252; First Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 241, 321, 364-365, 381, 408.\n\nMemorial, paras. 246, 250-261; JRP Report, dated October 2007, pp. 14, 20, 83, 92-93, 128, Exhibit C-34/R-212; First Expert Report of David Estrin paras. 321, 408; Transcription of CBC radio interview of Robert Fournier (JRP), dated 20 December 2007; Exhibit C-180.\n\nReply, para. 132.\n\nMemorial, para. 269; JRP Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, dated 16 June 2007, p. 149, line 18, where Paul Buxton noted: \"If that situation stays as it is, then of course we will live with it and we have designed around it, and we feel that we can accommodate it.\", Exhibit C-153.

The JRP was mandated under Part IV of the *NSEA* to consider the socio-economic effects of a project in particular, an inquiry that can include whether the proposed project goes against the community's core values.227 These requirements for the JRP to go beyond the impact of a project on the physical environment were also reflected in the EIS Guidelines, in particular the requirement for the proponent to provide information on the \"Existing Human Environment\" and on \"Social and Cultural Patterns\".228\n\nRejoinder, paras. 33-37; First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, paras. 282-291.\n\nRejoinder, para. 35 (referring to First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 230 and Second Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 306, 311); *NSEA*, s. 3; First Affidavit of Christopher Daly, para. 5.\n\nRejoinder, para. 36; JRP Agreement, paras. 4.1, 6.3, Exhibit R-27; EIS Guidelines, p. 45, Exhibit R-210; First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, paras. 262-275.\n\n216.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent observes that the JRP makes only a recommendation and does not constitute in itself a legally binding determination on the Investors of which they can complain in this setting.229\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 175.\n\n**(g) Whether the Local Community Support for the Whites Point Project was Extensive**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni.

THE WHITES POINT EA GOVERNMENT DECISIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n220.\n\nOn 22 October 2007, the JRP submitted its report to the federal Minister of the Environment and the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour, recommending rejection of the proposal.236 Between 29 October and 16 November 2007, Bilcon requested in writing that the government of Nova Scotia dismiss the JRP's recommendations.237 Nevertheless, on 20 November 2007, Nova Scotia adopted the JRP's recommendations to reject the Whites Point project.238 The next month, the Canadian Government also accepted the JRP's recommendation and announced its decision not to issue the permits and authorizations that Bilcon had requested in connection with the Whites Point project.239\n\nJRP Report, Environmental Assessment of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, October 2007.\n\nLetter from Paul Buxton to Minister Mark Parent, dated 29 October 2007, Exhibit C-195; Letter from Paul Buxton to Minister Mark Parent, dated 8 November 2007, Exhibit C-196; Letter from Paul Buxton to Minister Mark Parent, dated 16 November 2007, Exhibit C-2.\n\nLetter from Minister Mark Parent to Paul Buxton, dated 20 November 2007, Exhibit C-541.\n\nOrder in Council re Approval of the Government of Canada's response to the Environmental Assessment Report of the Review Panel, dated 13 December 2007, Exhibit C-205.\n\n**2.

The Investors' Position\n--------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Investors allege that the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour \"blindly endorsed\" the JRP Report, without giving Bilcon an opportunity to respond or to meet with the Minister.240 The Investors point to what they call a \"failure\" on the part of the Respondent to arrange for a face-to-face meeting between the Minister and the Investors during his decisionmaking.\n\nMemorial, paras. 270-276; Letter from Paul Buxton to Nancy Vanstone, regarding a meeting that was scheduled with Bilcon, dated 9 January 2008, Exhibit C-199; Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 84; Reply, para. 161.\n\n223.\n\nThe Investors mount similar allegations in respect to the federal Minister for the Environment. According to the Investors, both tiers of government \"failed to exercise the discretion they were obligated by law to exercise\", a violation of the principles of natural justice.241 The Investors assert that the Respondent was obliged to provide detailed reasons as to why the project could not be justified.242\n\nMemorial, paras. 277-282; Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, paras. 83, 85; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 534; Reply, paras. 161-165.\n\nMemorial, para. 281.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Investors that a thorough consideration of the JRP's recommendations and independent decision-making was required of both levels of government,243 but submits that this standard was met.244 The Respondent distinguishes the EA process under the auspices of the JRP, which is focused on information gathering, from the decision-making involving the federal and Nova Scotia governments, which accepted the JRP's recommendation. While the JRP could only make recommendations,245 the second part of the process involved the two levels of governments making autonomous decisions in light of their respective legislative regimes.246 Still, the Respondent contends that accepting the JRP's recommendation is not akin to acknowledging and adopting the JRP's conduct in reaching that recommendation.247\n\nRejoinder, para. 38; Expert Report of Robert Connelly, para. 131.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 207-212.\n\nRejoinder, para. 38.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 205.\n\nHearing Transcript, 30 October 2013, p. 180, lines 6-12.\n\n225.\n\nIn respect of the Investors' concern regarding the absence of a face-to-face meeting, the Respondent maintains that Canadian law and natural justice \"require one hearing, not two\".248\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 275.\n\n**(b) Whether the Federal and Provincial Governments Considered the JRP's Recommendations Independently**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni.

THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn international arbitration, it is for the applicant to establish that a tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and decide a matter. A Chapter Eleven tribunal only has authority to the extent that is provided by Chapter Eleven itself.\n\n229.\n\nIn Chapter Eleven, the NAFTA Parties, in the interest of ensuring \"a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment\"253 established protections for investors. They also enabled investors to bring a host state directly to arbitration for a legally binding decision. These remedial mechanisms mean that investors possessing the nationality of another NAFTA Party do not have to depend on their home state to espouse their grievances, as would be the case in general international law. Instead, investors can proceed directly to arbitration on their own. General international law also provides that a state is not automatically subject to the jurisdiction of international adjudicatory bodies to decide in a legally binding way on complaints concerning its treatment of a foreign investor, but must give its consent to that means of dispute resolution. The heightened protection given to investors from other NAFTA Parties under Chapter Eleven of the Agreement must be interpreted and applied in a manner that respects the limits that the NAFTA Parties put in place as integral aspects of their consent, in Chapter Eleven, to an overall enhancement of their exposure to remedial actions by investors. The Parties to NAFTA chose to go as far, but only as far, as they stipulate in Chapter Eleven towards enhancing the international legal rights of investors.\n\nNAFTA, Preamble.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent advances five objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. First, the Respondent contends that the Investors' claims regarding the industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry do not \"relate to\" the Investors or their investment, as required by NAFTA Article 1101. Secondly, the Respondent maintains that some of the Investors' claims regarding the industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry are time-barred by NAFTA Chapter Eleven's limitation period. Thirdly, the Respondent submits that the JRP is not an organ of Canada and that, therefore, its actions cannot be attributed to the Respondent. Fourthly, the Respondent alleges that the Investors' claims concern measures that could not have caused them any loss. Fifthly, the Respondent raises an objection to the inclusion of William Ralph Clayton as a claimant in these proceedings on the basis that he maintains no ownership or direct financial interest in Bilcon of Delaware. This last objection was made on the fourth day of the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, and the Investors oppose it as untimely pursuant to Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n231.\n\nThese defences will be addressed in sequence.\n\n**A. WHETHER THE INVESTORS' CLAIM \u2018RELATES TO' THE INVESTORS AND THEIR INVESTMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent's first jurisdictional objection arises from NAFTA Article 1101(1), which reads:\n\nThis Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Investors' claim regarding the decisions and actions of the DFO in respect of the 3.9 ha quarry relate to Nova Stone only254 rather than to the Investors as required by NAFTA Article 1101. Nova Stone, not Bilcon, obtained the industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry from the NSDEL on 30 April 2002; Bilcon joined Nova Stone in partnership thereafter but it never had any rights over the 3.9 ha quarry.255\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 221.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 216 (referring to Memorial, paras. 459-460).\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the interpretation by the *Methanex* tribunal,256 according to which, Canada contends, the phrase \"relating to\" in Article 1101(1) requires a \"legally significant connection between the measure and the investor\".257 Thus, according to the Respondent, the *Methanex* tribunal plainly rejected the Investors' proposition that \"NAFTA tribunals have interpreted Article 1101... by deciding that a measure \u2018relates to' an investor or investment if it affects the investor or investment\".258\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 217-218.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 218 (referring to *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, First Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 147).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 218, n.466 (referring to Memorial, para. 748).\n\n235.\n\nAs the *Methanex* tribunal did not define \"legally significant connection\", the question whether a legally significant connection exists between an impugned measure and an investor or investment must be decided on a case-by-case basis.259 Here, the Respondent emphasizes that \"the industrial approval was issued to Nova Stone and, as a matter of Nova Scotia law, neither the Claimants nor their investment had any rights or obligations under that approval.\"260 Moreover, the *NSEA* provided that Nova Stone was prohibited from transferring, selling, leasing, assigning or otherwise disposing of the approval without the written consent of the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour. Nor could the execution of the partnership agreement between Bilcon and Nova Stone, entered into on 2 May 2002, extend the protection of the treaty to Bilcon in respect of the 3.9 ha quarry, after the issuance of the industrial approval.261 In the Respondent's view, the industrial approval could not, therefore, have any \"legally significant connection\" to the Investors.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 218; Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 173.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 219-220; First Affidavit of Bob Petrie, paras. 15-17.\n\nRejoinder, para. 50; First Affidavit of Bob Petrie, para. 15; *NSEA*, s. 59(1).\n\n236.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent concludes that the Investors lack standing since, under international law, a claimant does not have standing to bring a claim on behalf of or for losses or damages suffered by one of its partners.262\n\nRejoinder, para. 51 (referring to *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Investors argue, first, that the Respondent's measures fit the definition of \"measures\" in NAFTA Article 201(1), which defines measures as \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\".263 The Investors then argue that \"there is a direct and significant connection\" between the Respondent's measures and their impact on the Investors and the investment:264\n\nThe failure to grant the license to operate a 3.9 quarry to Nova Stone on April 30, 2002 constitutes a measure which directly relates to the Investor and its Investment. The joint-venture agreement called for the initial operation of a 10 acre quarry. This direct inclusion in the agreement satisfies the test for a \"legally significant connection\" between the Investors and measure established in *Methanex.* Furthermore, the industrial approvals to operate a quarry were the contribution that Nova Stone was making to the joint venture. The failure to obtain licenses hence directly and specifically relates to the Investment the Investor was seeking to make. Bilcon was directly involved in this project from the beginning.265\n\nMemorial, para. 742. NAFTA Article 201(1) provides: \"For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified:.measure includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.\"\n\nMemorial, para. 747.\n\nReply, para. 711 (referring also to *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, First Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 147).\n\n238.\n\nIn any event, the Investors argue that \"the drafters of NAFTA did not limit \u2018relating to' with prefixes like \u2018directly' or \u2018substantially'\".266 The Investors further argue that \"Canada's *Statement on Implementation* supports the interpretation that NAFTA Article 1101 was intended to broadly bring foreign Investors and investments within Chapter 11's protection\".267 The Investors refer to decisions in the *Pope & Talbot* and *GAMI Investments* cases, in which the tribunals accepted that a measure need not have a direct link to the investor or investment to be \"relating to\" it; \"it is also a measure relating to investment insofar as it might affect an enterprise owned by an investor of a Party\".268 The Investors submit that the NAFTA practice is consistent with jurisprudence from international dispute resolution bodies considering other international treaties.269\n\nMemorial, para. 743; Black's Law Dictionary, 5th ed. (St Paul: West Publishing Co, 1979), p. 1158, Exhibit CA-92.\n\nMemorial, para. 743; Canadian Statement on Implementation, NAFTA, p. 148, Exhibit CA-45.\n\nMemorial, paras. 748-749 (referring to *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award Concerning \"Measures Relating to Investment\" Motion, 26 January 2000, paras. 33-34).\n\nMemorial, paras. 744, 750-751 (referring to *Indonesia\u2014Certain Measures Affecting the Automobile Industry,* Report of the Panel, WT/DS54/R, WT/DS55/R, WT/DS59/R, WT/DS64/R, 2 July 1998, para. 14.82, and citing the WTO Appellate Body: \"We agree with the Panel that the word \u2018affecting' refers primarily to \u2018the way in which [measures] relate to a covered agreement.' As the Appellate Body stated in *EC\u2014Bananas III*, \u2018[t]he ordinary meaning of the word \u2018affecting' implies a measure that has \u2018an effect on' something else.\" *United States\u2014Subsidies on Upland Cotton,* Report of the Appellate Body, WT/DS267/AB/R, 3 March 2005, para. 261).\n\n239.\n\nThe partnership agreement states that the partners agree to carry on a quarry and terminal business, that Nova Stone will transfer its lease over the property to the partnership as well as all necessary or desirable licenses or permits. Under the agreement, Bilcon would pay Nova Stone several hundred thousand dollars at an initial stage\u2014until a mining license and dock permit were obtained\u2014and then millions more, in stages, as the project progressed.270\n\nPartnership Agreement, Nova Stone and Bilcon, Exhibit R-293.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the holding of the *Methanex* tribunal that, to relate to investors of another Party, it was not enough for a measure to have an economic impact on an investor. Such an approach would expose host states to claims not only from an investor affected directly by a government measure, but also for example, the investor's suppliers, the suppliers to the investor's suppliers, and so on. Rather, the *Methanex* tribunal found that there must be a \"legally significant connection\" between a state measure and an investor. The *Methanex* tribunal acknowledged that \"whilst the exact line may remain undrawn, it should still be possible to determine which side of the divide a particular claim must lie\".271 The present Tribunal considers the *Methanex* approach to be a sound basis for deliberation on this case.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 218, citing *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, First Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 147.\n\n241.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, Bilcon had a significant legal connection with the proposed 3.9 ha quarry\u2014and with the larger quarry and terminal project\u2014as a result of its partnership agreement with Nova Stone. At this point Bilcon qualified as an investor for the purposes of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA. Bilcon had standing to raise challenges under Chapter Eleven in respect to government measures addressing matters such as industrial permits sought by Nova Stone, transfers of such permits to the partnership, approvals sought by Nova Stone, and applications by Nova Stone or the partnership for environmental licenses.\n\n**B. TIMELINESS OF THE INVESTORS' CLAIMS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Respondent's second jurisdictional objection arises from NAFTA Article 1116(2), which reads:\n\nAn investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Investors' claims are time-barred, referring to the NAFTA provision just quoted, which it asserts \"requires an investor to challenge a measure within three years of its first acquiring actual or constructive knowledge: (1) of the measure giving rise to the breach; and (2) that it has incurred loss or damage as a result of the breach\".272\n\nRejoinder, para. 54. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 225; Letter from Meg Kinnear to Barry Appleton, dated 18 June 2008, Exhibit R-501; Letter from Barry Appleton to Meg Kinnear, dated 5 August 2008, Exhibit R-502.\n\n244.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Investors, through Mr. Buxton, had actual knowledge of the measures upon which the Investors rely and of the alleged losses suffered at least five years before submitting their claim to arbitration on 17 June 2008.273 It is undisputed that the industrial approval for the 3.9 ha quarry was null and void as of 1 May 2004.274\n\nRejoinder, para. 60; Letter from Paul Buxton to NSDEL, dated 25 June 2003, Exhibit R-382; Excerpt from 2003 Journal of Derek McDonald, dated 10 June 2003, Exhibit R-551.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 222; First Affidavit of Bob Petrie, para. 17. *See also* Counter Memorial, paras. 223-258; Rejoinder, paras. 54-60; Hearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 228, lines 16-25.\n\n245.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Investors' interpretation of Article 1116(2), requiring a demonstration that a claimant had \"concrete knowledge of actual loss\",275 is contrary to the ordinary meaning as affirmed by other NAFTA tribunals. Concrete knowledge of the actual amount of loss or damage is not a pre-requisite to the running of the time period under Article 1116(2). In support of its interpretation, the Respondent relies on the NAFTA awards in *Grand River*, *Mondev* and *UPS*.276\n\nRejoinder, para. 59 (referring to Reply, para. 727).\n\nRejoinder, para. 59 (referring to *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006, para. 77 (\"A party is said to incur losses, expenses, debts or obligations, all of which may significantly damage the party's interests, even if there is no immediate outlay of funds or if the obligations are to be met through future conduct. Moreover, damage or injury may be incurred even though the amount or extent may not become known until some future time.\"); *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para. 87 (\"a claimant may know that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent or quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear\"); *United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, para. 29 (\"The fact that the exact magnitude of the loss was not yet finally determined would not have been enough... to avoid the time bar if the time bar otherwise would have applied.\")).\n\n246.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, a textual interpretation of the word \"first\" in NAFTA Article 1116(2) confirms that the word identifies the start of a period or event.277 While the NAFTA Contracting Parties contemplated that investors could challenge \"continuing measures\" under Chapter Eleven, the Respondent asserts that they \"nonetheless addressed the precise moment at which the time bar applicable to such claims would apply. The running of the time bar is to be calculated from the \u2018first' acquisition of relevant knowledge, not subsequent, repeated or ultimate acquisition of such knowledge\".278 Thus, \"[w]hether a measure continues or ends is irrelevant to the operation of the NAFTA time bar because calculation of the three-year period is triggered by \u2018first' knowledge of breach and loss\".279 The Respondent submits that all three NAFTA Contracting Parties support this interpretation of Article 1116(2), which also amounts to subsequent practice under Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.280\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 226; Shorter Oxford Dictionary, 5th ed.

The Respondent argues that *United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, on which the Investors rely was wrongly decided on this point\u2014a view shared by all three NAFTA parties.\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the measures that pre-date 17 June 2005 were \"continuing\" and argues that the continuing \"effects\" of a measure do not transform it into a \"continuing measure\".281 The industrial approval and the Blasting Conditions contained therein were null and void by 1 May 2004 when Nova Stone withdrew from the project and ceased to control the 3.9 ha parcel.282 According to the Respondent, any loss or damage incurred from that measure had to be known by that date, as can be seen in a letter from Mr. Buxton to NSDEL of 25 June 2003.283 Mr. Buxton's letter states that:\n\n*There are serious financial consequences which arise from our inability to operate in accordance with the Permit, and we are imploring the Province to stand behind the authority and enforce the conditions of the Permit.*\n\nThe Company has suffered significant costs due to the delay and the jurisdictional machinations employed by DFO. This Company has acted in good faith and we expect the same of the Province in interpreting and enforcing the Permit. We feel we have satisfied all conditions and we ask that you confirm that for us so that we may proceed with the work contemplated by the Permit. To do otherwise will make the Province complicit in the DFO conduct.\n\n*Failure to act will cause severe economic hardship to the Company and the project.* It will also send a clear message on the excessive difficulty and high level of uncertainty that companies face when they seek to invest in Nova Scotia.284\n\nFurther, Bilcon entered into a new lease agreement with the owners of the land containing the 3.9 ha parcel that was subject to the industrial approval. It was thus Nova Stone and the Investors themselves who invalidated the industrial approval.285\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 255; First Affidavit of Bob Petrie, para. 17; Rejoinder, para. 57.\n\nLetter from Mr. Paul Buxton to Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Labour, dated 25 June 2003, Exhibit R-382. *See also* Hearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 228, lines 16-25.\n\nLetter from Mr. Paul Buxton to Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Labour, dated 25 June 2003, Exhibit R-382 (cited in Counter-Memorial, para. 251) (emphasis added).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 256.\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Investors' contentions that the Blasting Conditions allowed the DFO to refuse permission to Bilcon to carry out test blasting during the EA or prevented Bilcon from accumulating the necessary data.286 The Respondent submits that the Blasting Conditions had no impact on Bilcon's ability to gather the necessary data for its EA;287 as Mr. Buxton testified, the Investors did not attempt to carry out test blasting during the EA process, though they could have done so.288 Further, the \"lack of test blasting\" was not relied upon by the JRP as a reason to recommend against approval of the Whites Point project.289\n\nRejoinder, para. 56 (referring to Reply, para. 700).\n\nHearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 136, lines 10-18.\n\nHearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 137, lines 10-16.\n\nRejoinder, para. 58; Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 153, lines 8-14; JRP Report, dated October 2007, pp. 14, 101-107, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the DFO decisions to which the Investors refer for their claims in this case had no continuing aspect. The scoping decision was made with immediate effect on 14 April 2003; the decision that at least a comprehensive study would be needed was made also on 14 April 2003; the referral to a JRP occurred on 26 June 2003.290 To the extent that these decisions entailed additional cost or expense as alleged by the Investors, those were known or should have been known before 17 June 2005.291\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 259-266; Rejoinder paras. 61-62; Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 148, lines 16-21.\n\nRejoinder, para. 62; Counter-Memorial, paras. 259-266.\n\n**2. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nIt is the Investors' position that there are two prerequisite conditions for the timing to commence on the three-year limitation period in NAFTA Article 1116(2). First, the investor must have acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the breach at issue. Secondly, the investor must have acquired knowledge that it has incurred loss or damage as a result of that breach. Only then does the period begin to run.292\n\nReply, para. 717.\n\n251.\n\nThe Investors assert that they suffered numerous continuous breaches with ongoing and direct effect until the ministerial decision on 17 December 2007.293 Those breaches include:\n\na) The conduct of the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Labour, jointly and separately, in relation to Bilcon's attempt to operate a quarry at Whites Point, which was set in motion by the industrial approval of its application on April 30, 2002. This measure includes:\n\ni) The ongoing effect of the imposition, interpretation and application of blasting conditions on the Investment such that they were never able to be satisfied;\n\nii) The taking of jurisdiction by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to address questions outside of the purported marine issues when it lacked said jurisdiction;\n\nii. The ongoing effect of the requirement to subject the Investment to a Comprehensive Study.\n\nb) The actions of the federal government and government of Nova Scotia, jointly and separately, to compel the Investors and the Investment to seek approval from the Joint Review Panel, which resulted in ongoing harm and damage to the Investors beginning on September 10, 2003 and continued through the Joint Review Panel process until the final Ministerial decisions. This measure includes:\n\ni) Continuous unlawful and unilateral actions of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans\n\nii) The ongoing impact of the requirement that the Investment be referred to the Joint Review Panel;\n\niii) The application of the relevant domestic rules by failing to apply the binding transitional provisions of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act to the Investment's permit application.294\n\nReply, para. 699 (but compare with the Memorial, para. 754, where the Investors stated that \"[t]he effects of the loss of the Whites Point Quarry upon the Investment and its Investors continue to this day\").\n\nReply, para. 698.\n\n252.\n\nAt the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, the Investors emphasized how their inability to carry out test blasting at the 3.9 ha site prevented them from gathering \"valuable scientific data that [they] could use for the purpose of developing the larger parcel\"295 as was seen in the JRP's criticism of the absence of appropriate data.296 The Investors likewise argued at the hearing that there was an \"intimate link\" between the smaller and larger quarries, contributing to their theory of a continuing act.297\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 280, lines 13-15; *see also* p. 284, lines 20-23, elaborating on the continuous effect of the \"original prevention of Bilcon being able to conduct a test blast going right through the piece all the way to the end of the JRP Report.\"\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 284, lines 5-19.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 290, lines 6-9.\n\n253.\n\nThe Investors argue that in international law continuing measures are well recognized298 and \"time limit rules do not prohibit claims challenging acts that are still continuing, because time limits only begin at the end of a continuing act\".299 Referring to case law arising under the European Convention on Human Rights, such as *De Becker*, the Investors submit that \"[i]nternational tribunals have consistently refused to bar claims challenging acts that are still continuing\".300\n\nReply, para. 713, referring to Article 14(2) of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\").\n\nMemorial, para. 725, referring to *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of its Thirtieth Session: 8 May-28 July 1978*, Document A/33/10, 1978 Yearbook of the International Law Commission, p. 91, n.437, Exhibit CA-77: \"... in the case of a \u2018continuing' wrongful act, however, this *dies* [ *a quo* of the time limit] can be established only *after* the end of the time of commission of the wrongful act itself.\".\n\nMemorial, para. 729, citing *De Becker v. Belgium*, European Court of Human Rights Application No. 214/56, 9 June 1958, Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights (1958-1959), p. 214, Exhibit CA-79.\n\n254.\n\nMoreover, the Investors maintain that NAFTA Article 1116(2) does not bar claims challenging continuing acts, pointing to the decisions in *Feldman* and *UPS*301 in which, they assert, the tribunals found that repeated action constitutes a separate breach each day it is repeated.302 In the Investors' view, the drafters intended for the NAFTA agreement to apply to continuing measures, which, in the context of the present dispute, are those that were brought into existence before 27 December 2003, but that the Respondent maintained beyond that date.303\n\nMemorial, paras. 734-737; Reply, para. 725.\n\nMemorial, para. 734.\n\nReply, para. 714.\n\n255.\n\nReferring to other NAFTA cases and Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,304 the Investors submit:\n\nIt is precisely at this point where the concept of continuing breach dovetails with that of non-continuing breach. Bilcon could not know of the loss it incurred from Canada's continuing measures until those measures were actually applied to it in concrete situations. That is, the time-bar on continuing measures could not possibly start to run until those measures were applied to Bilcon in particular circumstances.305\n\nThe Investors differentiate the *Grand River* case on which the Respondent relies, on its facts.306\n\nReply, para. 729.\n\nReply, para. 730.\n\nReply, para. 719; *see also* Investors' interpretation of this decision in paras. 720-724.\n\n256.\n\nIn the alternative, the Investors submit that they only acquired knowledge that they incurred loss or damage at the moment in which they learned of the federal Minister's acceptance of the JRP Report.307 The DFO's refusal to authorize blasting did not cause any loss or damage and therefore did not trigger the limitation period to run.308 The Investors state that it was not until December 2007 that \"it became official that the federal and provincial governments accepted the Joint Review Panel's recommendation to reject Bilcon's application; thereby, making it official, for the first time, that Bilcon would not be able to move forward in its planned investment\".309\n\nReply, para. 737.\n\nReply, para. 739.\n\nReply, para. 740.\n\n257.\n\nThe Investors argue that their interpretation of \"loss or damage\" under NAFTA is supported by decisions of NAFTA tribunals which require that the breach of NAFTA be the cause for the \"loss or damage\" suffered by the investor.310\n\nReply, para. 741, referring to *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para. 87, and *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Second Partial Award, 21 October 2002, para. 140.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the general rules of international law on time-limits and their consequences are applicable to the question before it, but is also aware that specific terms of NAFTA might enjoy priority as *leges speciales*. Thus, case law must be viewed in the context of the particulars of the laws at play and the factual situations in each case.\n\n259.\n\nThe Investors begin their review of general international law by citing the *De Becker* case.311 In that case, in 1947 a Belgian Military Tribunal had confirmed a conviction of the applicant for wartime collaboration and modified his death sentence to life imprisonment. By operation of statute law various disabilities attached to the conviction, including a ban from practising De Becker's profession of journalism. In 1955, the European Convention on Human Rights entered into force. Basing himself on the Convention, De Becker filed a complaint against the ban over a year later. The Convention precluded recourse to the European Commission on Human Rights *ratione temporis* until domestic remedies were exhausted, further a complaint had to be made within six months of \"the final decision\". The Commission found that the six-month bar was not applicable. The disabilities were an ongoing state of affairs. The applicant was not challenging the 1947 conviction, but rather the ongoing operation of law for which there was no domestic legal remedy. The Commission found that under international law, restrictive provisions concerning timeliness were not to be given a \"broad interpretation\", and that this was especially the case when human rights were at issue.\n\n*De Becker v. Belgium*, European Court of Human Rights Application No. 214/56, 9 June 1958, Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights (1958-1959), p. 214, Exhibit CA-79.\n\n260.\n\nTo indicate the complications that can arise in trying to applying case law in one area to other contexts, *De Becker* differs from the case before the Tribunal in respects that include the following: the issue here does not involve human rights; there is here no question of the applicability of new domestic law to events that began before its inception; and the challenge here concerning timeliness is to decisions (such as the referral to a JRP) that interpret and apply a law in specific relation to Bilcon, rather than to a law itself.\n\n261.\n\nThe most relevant case law concerns timeliness in the NAFTA context. In the *UPS* case, the core issue was the maintenance of the monopoly of Canada Post, embodied in statute law, over small parcel deliveries, to the exclusion of the investor, a state of affairs which had been in place for more than three years before the filing of the investor's claim. Bilcon refers to the passage of the award already quoted by the Tribunal above, in which the view is expressed that continuing courses of conduct constitute continuing breaches and renew the limitation period accordingly.312 However, the tribunal in *UPS* clarified that in the case of a continuing breach the claimant can only obtain compensation in respect of the loss occurring within the three years prior to the filing of the NAFTA claim:\n\nAlthough we find that there is no time bar to the claims, the limitation period does have a particular application to a continuing course of conduct. If a violation of NAFTA is established with respect to any particular claim, any obligation associated with losses arising with respect to that claim can be based only on losses incurred within three years of the date when the claim was filed. A continuing course of conduct might generate losses of a different dimension at different times. It is incumbent on claimants to establish the damages associated with asserted breaches, and for continuing conduct that must include a showing of damages not from the inception of the course of conduct but only from the conduct occurring within the period allowed by article 1116(2). This is not, however, a matter we need to address further at this point apart from the specific claims.313\n\nThe *UPS* tribunal dismissed the NAFTA claim on the merits.\n\nMemorial, para. 735 (citing *United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, para. 28).\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, para. 30.\n\n262.\n\nIn the *Mondev* case, on which Canada relies heavily, the issue was whether liability for certain state actions attributable to the United States was barred because these actions had occurred prior to the entering into force of NAFTA in 1994. The tribunal excluded from eligibility various actions that had taken place prior to NAFTA's entering into force, and considered on the merits a court decision that had been rendered after that date. With respect to the pre-1994 actions, the tribunal stated that, as they did not trigger NAFTA liability in the first place, they could not be the subject of ongoing duties by state authorities to remedy NAFTA breaches that remained virulent after NAFTA had entered into force. With respect to the investor's theory of continuing breaches, the tribunal stated as follows:\n\nSince the claims within the Tribunal's jurisdiction are limited to those under Article 1105 which challenge the decisions of the United States courts, no question arises as to the time bar. The present proceedings were commenced within three years from the final court decisions. If it had mattered, however, the Tribunal would not have accepted Mondev's argument that it could not have had \u2018knowledge of...loss or damage' arising from the actions of the City and BRA prior to the United States court decisions. *A claimant may* *know that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent or quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear. It must have been known to Mondev, at the latest by 1 January* *1994, that not all its losses would be met by the proceedings LPA had commenced in Massachusetts.* In any event, the words \u2018loss or damage' refer to the loss or damage suffered by the investor as a result of the breach. Courts award compensation because loss or damage has been suffered, and this is the normal sense of the term 'loss or damage' in Articles 1116 and 1117. Thus if Mondev's claims concerning the conduct of the City and BRA had been continuing NAFTA claims as at 1 January 1994, they would now be time-barred. This is a further reason for limiting the Tribunal's consideration of the substantive claims to those concerning the decisions of the United States' courts.314\n\nCanada places strong emphasis on the italicized passage.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para. 87 (emphasis added).\n\n263.\n\nThe *Feldman* case involved taxation of the investor in respect of its cigarette sales. The facts included a complicated series of legislative acts, administrative decisions and court challenges that unfolded over a number of years, many of them before the three-year period began. The tribunal considered, and upheld on the merits, claims concerning the denial of a set of specific requests for tax rebates, each request having been filed within the three years.315\n\n*Marvin Feldman v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, para. 203.\n\n264.\n\nIn the *Grand River* case, federal and state authorities within the United States had enacted a series of laws in connection with a Master Settlement Agreement reached between a group of U.S. states and a group of tobacco manufacturers. The tribunal held that claims in respect of enactments at the federal and state level, including requirements for producers to make payments based on a percentage of their sales into escrow funds, were barred by the three-year rule. The tribunal allowed claims to be considered on the merits, however, in respect of later enactments to strengthen the scheme established by the Master Settlement Agreement and to pressure other manufacturers into joining that agreement. The tribunal's reasoning was as follows:\n\nIn the circumstances here, the Tribunal has difficulty seeing how NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) can be interpreted to bar consideration of the merits of properly 37 presented claims challenging important statutory provisions that were enacted within three years of the filing of the claim and that allegedly caused significant injury, even if those provisions are related to earlier events. As the Permanent Court observed, while \"a dispute may presuppose the existence of some prior situation or fact...it does not follow that the dispute arises in regard to the situation or fact.\" The *Mondev* and *Feldman* tribunals both considered the merits of claims regarding events occurring during the three-year limitations period, even though they were linked to, and required consideration of, events prior to the limitations period or to NAFTA's entry into force. In *Mondev*, the Tribunal considered (and rejected) the Claimant's claim that it had suffered a denial of justice in connection with state court proceedings occurring after NAFTA entered into force, although the dispute underlying the litigation arose years before. In *Feldman*, the Tribunal awarded damages in respect of discrimination occurring during the three-year limitations period, but its analysis of this and other claims again required consideration of earlier events.316\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al, v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006, para. 86 (internal citations omitted).\n\n265.\n\nWhile the Parties to the present case have sharply different views on whether *UPS* was correct or not in its handling of the three-year rule, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to decide the matter. *UPS* involved its own set of facts, including some measures that predated NAFTA or were of wide application rather than being specifically directed at the investor only.\n\n266.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal finds it possible and appropriate, as did the tribunals in *Feldman*, *Mondev* and *Grand River*, to separate a series of events into distinct components, some time-barred, some still eligible for consideration on the merits.\n\n267.\n\nThe essential acts and omissions concerning governmental approval of Nova Stone's 3.9 ha quarry application and the referral of the environmental assessment to a JRP were completed before 17 June 2005. Nova Stone's application expired on 1 May 2004, before the three year period began to run.317 The referral to the JRP was made by the Minister on 7 August 2003. The *effects* of various decisions concerning the attaching of conditions to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans permit or the refusal to issue it and the referral of the case to a JRP might have extended into the three-year period and beyond, but that is not sufficient to turn them into ongoing acts for the purposes of the three-year limitation period. The key decisions with respect to the Nova Stone permit and the referral to the JRP were made in respect of the specific project of concern to the Investors and relayed to the Investors several years before the three-year period even began.\n\nAs explained in Counter-Memorial, para. 160, n.363, relying on First Affidavit of Bob Petrie, para. 17.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal's position that an act can be complete even if it has continuing ongoing effects, is in line with the view of the tribunal in *Mondev*, and further consistent with Article 14(1) of the International Law Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, according to which:\n\nThe breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character occurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.\n\n269.\n\nThe Investors refer in their submissions to the ongoing effect of imposing blasting conditions, the ongoing effect of requiring (initially) a comprehensive study of the investment and the ongoing impact of the referral of the project to the JRP.318 These ongoing impacts, however, do not establish that there were ongoing acts.\n\nMemorial, para. 753.\n\n270.\n\nThe task of the JRP, in the Tribunal's understanding, was not to sit as a reviewing or appellate body with respect to earlier decisions by officials belonging to the executives of Nova Scotia and Canada. The Investors might have had various domestic remedies with respect to these earlier decisions, considered in their own right, including perhaps judicial review. If they had been of a sufficiently serious character, some of these acts might in themselves or in combination have constituted the basis for a NAFTA claim.\n\n271.\n\nEven if a distinct act has been completed, however, the three-year period does not begin to run until that investor \"first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage\".\n\n272.\n\nWith respect to the issuing of the permit for the 3.9 ha quarry, which would have allowed blasting, the conditional permit expired long before the three-year period began to run. Compliance with federal Canada's Blasting Guidelines was one of the conditions attached to industrial approval issued by the Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Labour on 30 April 2002.319 The permit expired two years later. The Investors were informed on 12 November 2004, that officials had earlier provided mistaken information concerning the need for a 500 meter setback in order to comply with federal fisheries guidelines.320 On 10 September 2003, Bilcon received notice that the project had been referred to a JRP.\n\nLetter from Bob Petrie to Paul Buxton, with approval attached, dated 30 April 2002, Exhibit R-87.\n\nE-mail from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 12 November 2004, Exhibit R-531.\n\n273.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of Article 1116(2), it is necessary, however, that the investor has actual or constructive knowledge not only of an \"alleged breach\" of Chapter Eleven, but also that the investor has incurred \"loss or damage\". In this regard Bilcon argues that the time limitation in Article 1116(2) should not be interpreted and applied in a way that effectively requires an investor to already file a claim when it has \"incurred loss in some abstract sense\" rather than having a \"concrete knowledge of the actual loss it has incurred as a result\".321\n\nReply, para. 727.\n\n274.\n\nAs against this, Canada submits that the \"overwhelming weight of authority\" from the case law of NAFTA tribunals is to the effect that \" *concrete* knowledge of the *actual* amount of loss or damage is *not* a prerequisite to the running of the time period under Article 1116(2)\".322 The Tribunal recalls that Canada cites to this effect the following NAFTA decisions: (i) *Grand River* : \"A party is said to incur losses, expenses, debts or obligations, all of which may significantly damage the party's interests, even if there is no immediate outlay of funds or if the obligations are to be met through future conduct. Moreover, damage or injury may be incurred even though the amount or extent may not become known until some future time\".323 (ii) *Mondev* : \"[A] claimant knows that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent or quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear\".324 (iii) *UPS* : \"The fact that the exact magnitude of the loss was not yet finally determined would not have been enough to avoid the time bar if the time bar otherwise would have been applied\".325\n\nRejoinder, para. 59.\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006, para. 77.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para. 87.\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, para. 29.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of its predecessors on this point. The plain language of Article 1116(2) does not require full or precise knowledge of loss or damage. It might be that some qualification can be read into the plain language, such as a requirement that the loss be material. To require a reasonably specific knowledge of the amount of loss would, however, involve reading into Article 1116(2) a requirement that might prolong greatly the inception of the three-year period and add a whole new dimension of uncertainty to the time-limit issue; it would have to be determined in each case not only whether there is actual or constructive knowledge of loss of damage, but whether the investor has knowledge that is sufficiently \"actual\" or \"concrete\".\n\n276.\n\nThere might be some practical advantages resulting from a decision by an investor to forego bringing a claim until the investor is reasonably certain in its own mind about the precise nature and amount of loss or damage. The investor would be in a better position to gauge the potential gains from successful litigation in comparison to its cost. The host state would be in a better position to assess its financial exposure, and make decisions about whether to settle and how much to invest in defending the claim.\n\n277.\n\nHowever, pragmatic observations like the ones just mentioned are not all on the side of interpreting Article 1116(2) in a manner that expands the timing options open to an investor. A host state can be prejudiced by a loss of institutional memory or documents on its part concerning the alleged breaches. Delay in bringing a claim might result in a situation where a host state is unknowingly carrying on acts or omissions for which it might be ordered to pay compensation.\n\n278.\n\nWith respect to knowledge of damage or loss concerning the 3.9 ha quarry, Canada submits to the Tribunal's attention a letter dated 25 June 2003, from Mr. Buxton, the lead Nova Stone representative in dealing with the authorities involved, to Mr. Petrie, an official at the NSDEL.326 The letter states that Nova Stone was in a position to begin the production of aggregate and that it has complied with all the terms of its Nova Scotia permit, including compliance with the DFO Blasting Guidelines. It expresses concern about the failure to that point of the DFO to confirm compliance. It urges Nova Scotia to not permit the DFO to effectively override provincial jurisdiction.\n\nLetter from Paul Buxton to Bob Petrie, dated 25 June 2003, Exhibit R-382.\n\n279.\n\nWith respect to loss and damage from decisions by federal Canada and Nova Scotia to refer the matter to a JRP, an expert report by Mr. David Estrin, submitted by Bilcon, explains how rare it is to conduct an assessment at this most demanding of levels, and explains that:\n\nthe use of a Review Panel process clearly can, as is demonstrated in the WPQ case, be prejudicial to a project proponent, in terms of burden, cost, time as well as outcome. The following terms describe important negative aspects of a Review Panel process compared to a screening or even a comprehensive study EA for a project proponent: \u2018timeconsuming', \u2018complex', \u2018expensive' as well as \u2018less predictable as to outcome'.327\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 28.\n\n280.\n\nThe Investors must have known of the expense and delay associated with participating in a JRP process long before 17 June 2005. A massive EIS was submitted by the Investors on 24 April 2006. According to Paul Buxton, he had worked on it for three and a half years.328\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 70.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal takes the view, therefore, that as regards the breaches identified by the Investors that arose prior to the beginning of the three-year period starting on 17 June 2005, the corresponding claims must be considered time-barred. They were distinct and completed events, specifically brought about by executive officials in relation to the project rather than of general application, and the Investors had actual or constructive knowledge that these breaches would cause significant loss or damage, even if the full extent of their ongoing adverse effects was not known.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates the thorough effort both sides in this dispute have made to investigate, document, present witnesses and argue regarding the events which the Tribunal has found to be time-barred. Some of these efforts provide necessary context to the consideration of the merits in respect of the rest of the case. While Article 1116(2) bars breaches in respect of events that took place more than three years before the claim was made, events prior to the three-year bar, however, are by no means irrelevant. They can provide necessary background or context for determining whether breaches occurred during the time-eligible period. Whether a party is an investor, or has made an investment, can depend in a case on activities that took place before the three-year clock began to run. The legitimate expectations of an investor\u2014a factor that may be part of an overall analysis of whether treatment has breached the minimum standard of fairness\u2014may depend crucially on contracts, assurances or the legal landscape, including existing statutes and judicial and administrative precedents, that existed before an alleged breach took place. The Tribunal is supported in this respect by the following passage from the *Mondev* award:\n\nOn the other hand, it does not follow that events prior to the entry into force of NAFTA may not be relevant to the question whether a NAFTA Party is in breach of its Chapter 11 obligations by conduct of that Party after NAFTA's entry into force. To the extent that the last sentence of the passage from the Feldman decision, quoted, appears to say the contrary, it seems to the present Tribunal to be too categorical, as indeed the United States conceded in argument.\n\nThus events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach.329\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, paras. 69-70 (internal citations omitted).\n\n**C. ATTRIBUTION OF THE ACTS OF THE JRP TO THE RESPONDENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that it is responsible for the acts of the following entities: the DFO, the Agency and NSDEL. There is also no dispute that Canada is responsible as a matter of international law for the acts of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the Minister of the Environment or the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour when they act in their Ministerial capacities. Finally, there is no dispute between the Parties that Canada is responsible for the acts of Nova Scotia, one of its constituent political subdivisions.330\n\nRejoinder, para. 63, n.112. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 65.\n\n284.\n\nHowever, in respect of the Investors' claim concerning the JRP, the Respondent advances four main arguments, referring to NAFTA Articles 1101 and 1116. First, the Respondent argues that the JRP is not an organ of the Government of Canada nor are the members of the JRP agents of the CEA Agency.331 Secondly, the JRP was not acting in a governmental authority in its role vis a vis the Investors' project.332 Thirdly, the JRP was not acting under the instructions or effective control of Canada when it committed the complained-of acts. Fourthly, Respondent has not acknowledged or adopted any of the complained-of acts as its own.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 269.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 269.\n\n**(a) The JRP is Not an Organ of Canada**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nReferring to Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles and to the *Genocide Convention* case decided in 2007 by the International Court of Justice, the Respondent maintains that \"a person or entity is an organ of a State at international law if it has the status of an organ in a State's internal law.\"333 The Respondent contends that neither JRPs as entities, nor the individual members of those panels, have that status in Canadian law nor do they meet the test articulated in the *Genocide Convention* case and adopted by certain NAFTA tribunals requiring that the entity act in \"complete dependence\" on the State.334 In its interpretation of the ILC Articles, the Respondent relies on the investment arbitration case *Jan de Nul v. Arab Republic of Egypt*.335\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 273.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 280-281 (referring to *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/1, Award, 14 July 2006, paras. 149-150; and to *GAMI Investments Inc. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Final Award, 15 November 2004, para. 110).\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008; Counter-Memorial, paras. 288, 295; Rejoinder, paras 69-70.\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that none of the key statutes of relevance in Canadian administrative law apply to a JRP or its members and that, therefore, they cannot be considered organs of the Government.336 At Canadian law, the Supreme Court has recognized that merely because an entity is subject to judicial review in Canada does not mean that it is a governmental entity.337\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 274. The Respondent refers to the Financial Administration Act, Library and Archives Act, Information Act and the Privacy Act as examples of such key statutes (Counter-Memorial, paras. 275-277).\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 170, lines 19-22, citing Counter-Memorial, paras. 277-279.\n\n287.\n\nThe Respondent argues that not one of the instances of Canadian case law referred to by the Investors supports the proposition that a JRP is an organ of Canada.338 Moreover, the Respondent argues that in Canada, \"judicial review is, in theory, available with respect to any entity that is a creature of statute. Thus, the mere fact that an entity is subject to judicial review in Canada does not mean that it is an organ of the government\".339 The Respondent also relies on the Supreme Court of Canada decision in *McKinney v. University of Guelph* to argue that \"the fact that an entity is a statutory body performing a public service and thus subject to judicial review \u2018does not in itself make [it] part of government'\".340\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 278.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 278.\n\nRejoinder, para. 67 (referring to *McKinney v. University of Guelph*, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, p. 48, Exhibit R-384). *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 278.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, \"while JRPs are created by government, they govern their own process from the time of their constitution until the time they finish their report. In particular, once the review panel is constituted, it takes no instruction from government, and operates completely independently\".341 According to Respondent, \"when a government organ offers evidence to the JRP on a topic within its expertise, it is treated as offering merely an expert opinion, not direction\".342\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 283; Expert Report of Robert Connelly, para. 63.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 284; Expert Report of Robert Connelly, para. 63.\n\n**(b) The JRP was Not Exercising Elements of Governmental Authority**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, \"when a person or entity that is not an organ is empowered to exercise certain government authority, only actions that occur during the exercise of that authority are attributable to the State\".343 Canada refers to Article 5 of the ILC Articles which summarizes this rule of customary law344 and to the *Jan de Nul v. Egypt* case in which the tribunal established a relevant two-part test: \"first, the act must be performed by an entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority [and] second, the act itself must be performed in the exercise of governmental authority\".345 The Respondent submits that a distinction should be drawn between public service and governmental authority as was done by the *Jan de Nul* tribunal. By evaluating information and making a recommendation to the government,346 the JRP was not exercising governmental authority in the exercise of public power, though it may have performed a public service.347 Thus, in the Respondent's view, applying the *Jan de Nul* test to this case shows that \"none of the alleged wrongful acts committed by the JRP can be attributed to Canada\".348\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 286.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 287.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 288 (citing *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v.

The Respondent further submits that during the Whites Point EA, the JRP did not exercise any of those functions.350 The fact that the JRP's \"organization and conduct of the public hearings in the Whites Point EA were done in the general fulfillment of both the public and government interest in environmental assessment... is not enough to show that these actions are governmental in nature\".351 The Respondent emphasizes that the decision on the EA, and whether to allow the project to proceed, remains exclusively with government organs.352\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 290; *CEAA*, s. 35.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 293.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 294. The Respondent relies on the decisions of the *Jan de Nul* and *UPS* tribunals; Counter-Memorial, paras. 295-296. Rejoinder, paras. 69-70.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 291. The Respondent refers also to the Supreme Court of Canada's *Fireman's Fund* case in which the court considered a recommendation by a body composed of government officials not to be attributable to the government. *See* Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 185, lines 1-5.\n\n291.\n\nWith regard to the Investors' reliance on the decisions of Canadian courts to argue that the JRP is an organ of Canada, the Respondent submits that this point is irrelevant because \"[t]he question here is whether, as a matter of international law, which the Tribunal is bound to apply, the JRP could be deemed to be exercising delegated governmental authority\".353 The Respondent further submits that, even if Canadian law were considered, the factors to determine whether an entity is performing a governmental function stated in *Godbout v. Longueuil* show that the JRP did not perform a governmental function.354\n\nRejoinder, para. 71.\n\nRejoinder, para. 72 (referring to Reply, para. 758).\n\n**(c) The JRP Did Not Act Under the Instructions or Effective Control of Canada**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors fail to set out the applicable test under international law for a determination of whether the JRP acted under the instructions or effective control of Canada, and that their argument should be dismissed on the basis of this failure alone.355\n\nRejoinder, para. 73.\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent refers to Article 8 of the ILC Articles and the *Genocide Convention* case in which the International Court of Justice elaborated on the notion of \"effective control\".356 Accordingly, the Respondent submits:\n\nWhile the JRP operated within the general mandate of its Terms of Reference (which could be considered general instructions), the JRP was an autonomous body. It organized its own internal procedures, determined how it would conduct the hearing, and decided itself on what it believed to be the appropriate approach to topics such as a cumulative effects analysis, the precautionary principle, adaptive management, mitigation measures, and information requests of the Claimants.357\n\nRejoinder, paras. 74-75 (referring to the *Genocide Convention* case, Exhibit RA-12, para. 400).\n\nRejoinder, para. 76.\n\n294.\n\nThus, even under the appropriate and applicable test, the JRP was not in dependence on Canada nor was Canada in control of the JRP.358 This conclusion is further supported by testimony that the JRP members wrote their report independent of any assistance from government liaisons.359\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 172, lines 12-14.\n\nHearing Transcript, 29 October 2013, p. 238, lines 3-22.\n\n**(d) The Respondent has Not Adopted Any of the Complained-of Acts**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors failed to describe and apply the relevant test in international law regarding adoption by a State of action undertaken by a non-governmental entity pursuant to Article 11 of the ILC Articles.360 The Respondent refers to the commentary to Article 11, which explains that \"international law requires a \u2018clear and unequivocal' acknowledgement or adoption of the \u2018conduct in question' in order for this rule to apply. It further clarifies that the \u2018language of \u2018adoption' carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct.'\"361\n\nRejoinder, para. 77.\n\nRejoinder, para. 79 (referring to ILC Articles and Commentary to Article 11, p. 53, Exhibit RA-60).\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the Minister's response to the JRP Report, issued on 17 December 2007, concluding that, after having \"carefully considered\" the report, as well as a series of letters from the Investors including their criticisms,362 the Government \"accepted\" and \"supported\" the ultimate recommendations made by the JRP. According to the Respondent, \"there is no acknowledgement or adoption of the JRP's conduct.\"363\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 187, lines 14-22.\n\nRejoinder, para. 80.\n\n**2. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The JRP is an Organ of Canada**\n-------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Investors argue that the JRP is an \"integral part of the government apparatus of Canada\".364 The JRP is a governmental entity established under the *CEAA* from which it derives its powers, exercises an executive function, and contributes an essential step in the environmental assessment process.365 The Investors also contend that the JRP is an instrument of the CEA Agency and that the \"members of the Joint Review Panel were individually and collectively agents of the CEA Agency\".366\n\nMemorial, para. 707.\n\nMemorial, para. 707 (referring to *Alberta Wilderness Assn. v. Canada*, p. 7 (F.C.A.), Exhibit C-261).\n\nMemorial, para. 706.\n\n298.\n\nThe Investors submit that \"the Canadian judiciary has confirmed that a Joint Review Panel comes within the meaning of a \u2018federal board, commission or other tribunal' under the *Federal Courts Act* of Canada\".367 This determination, according to the Investors, confirms that the JRP is \"part of the executive branch of the Canadian government\",368 and that it satisfies the requirements of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.369 The Investors reject the Respondent's reference to *McKinney v. University of Guelph*,370 maintaining that the relevant holding from that case was reversed in a later case.371 The Investors also note that the Respondent's expert \"acknowledges that the Whites Point Quarry review panel was carrying out a \u2018joint federal and provincial *mandate* '\".372\n\nMemorial, para. 709; *Federal Courts Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nAs a result of the Tribunal's ruling (above) to apply the time-bar to events predating 17 June 2005, the focus of the Tribunal's deliberations must necessarily shift to the JRP. Canada submits, however, that it is not responsible under NAFTA for the actions of the JRP. A party is only responsible for measures \"adopted or maintained by a Party\".\n\n306.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal's analysis is Article 105 of NAFTA, which reads:\n\nThe Parties shall ensure that all necessary measures are taken in order to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement, including their observance, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, by state and provincial governments.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has regard to relevant provisions of the ILC Articles, which provide as follows:\n\n*Article 4: Conduct of organs of a State*\n\nThe conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether that organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\nAn organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n\n*Article 5: Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority*\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n307.\n\nThe ILC Articles quoted here are considered as statements of customary international law on the question of attribution for purposes of asserting the responsibility of a State towards another State, which are applicable by analogy to the responsibility of States towards private parties.387\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, para. 156.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the Investors' contention that the JRP is an \"integral part of the government apparatus of Canada\".388 Even if it were not, the Investors submit, it is empowered to exercise elements of Canada's governmental authority. The Tribunal agrees. The JRP is not a body with an existence that precedes the assessment of a particular project or survives after its tasks are completed. Its members are appointed by the Minister of the Environment for Canada.389 Panel members may be appointed from a roster established by the Minister.390 The members must be \"unbiased and free from any conflict of interest relative to the project\". A body that exercises impartial judgment, however, can well be an organ of the state; Article 4 of the ILC Articles, just quoted, specifically includes those exercising \"judicial\" functions. The functions that the JRP must discharge are of a governmental nature. According to s. 34 of the *CEAA* :\n\n34. A review panel shall, in accordance with any regulations made for that purpose and with its terms of reference,\n\n(a) ensure that the information required for an assessment by a review panel is obtained and made available to the public;\n\n(b) hold hearings in a manner that offers the public opportunity to participate in the assessment;\n\n(c) prepare a report setting out\n\n(i) the rationale, conclusions and recommendations of the panel relating to the environmental assessment of the project, including any mitigation measures and followup program; and\n\n(ii) a summary of any comments received from the public; and\n\n(d) submit the report to the Minister and the responsible authority.\n\nMemorial, para. 707.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 33(1).\n\n*CEAA*, s. 33(1)(ii) and 33(2).\n\n309.\n\nThe assessment referred to here must be \"an assessment of the environmental effects of the project that is conducted in accordance with this Act and the regulations\".391 To carry out this statutory responsibility, the *CEAA* cloaks a Review Panel with the powers of a court with respect to summoning witnesses to testify and produce documents.392 The members of a Review Panel are vested with immunity from \"any action or other proceeding\" against them during the course of or for the purposes of the assessment.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 2.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 35.\n\n310.\n\nThe report of a Review Panel is an integral part of the process of decision-making by government. S. 37 of the *CEAA* provides that a Review Panel Report must be \"considered\" by the \"responsible authority\", that is, the part of the Canadian executive branch that makes the final decision over allowing the project to proceed. The responsible authority may issue approval if, after taking into account any mitigation measures it considers appropriate, that authority decides that:\n\nthe project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects;\n\nthe project is likely to cause significant adverse effects, but these are justified in the circumstances.393\n\n*CEAA*, s. 37(1).\n\n311.\n\nThe final decision of the responsible authority, when the assessment is made by way of a Review Panel, must be exercised with the approval of the Governor-in-Council\u2014that is, the federal cabinet, the senior decision making body in the executive of Canada.394\n\n*CEAA*, s. 37(2).\n\n312.\n\nThe report of the Review Panel, while not determinative, is therefore a mandated part of the environmental deliberation process.\n\n313.\n\nA Review Panel that is joint is similarly part of the apparatus of the Government of Canada and in any event exercising elements of Canadian governmental authority. The *CEAA* authorizes Canada to enter into agreements with authorities in other jurisdictions, including at the provincial level, to establish a JRP.395 A mandate of a JRP must always include the assessment of the project in accordance with the criteria set out in s. 16 of the *CEAA*.396 The chair must be appointed or approved by the Minister or else the Minister must appoint a co-chair. At least one other member of the panel must be appointed by the Minister. The Minister must fix or approve the terms of reference. The JRP has all the powers of summoning witnesses that the *CEAA* vests in ordinary review panels.397\n\n*CEAA*, s. 40.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 41.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 41.\n\n314.\n\nIn respect of the particular JRP under consideration in the present case, a Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement provided that Canada and Nova Scotia would each make nominations to the Panel and agree on the choice of a chair. The federal Canada Minister of the Environment would appoint three individuals to serve. Nova Scotia was made responsible for establishing the Secretariat for the Panel. Costs of the Panel were shared between Canada and Nova Scotia.398\n\nAgreement concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project between the Minister of the Environment, Canada and the Minister of Environment and Labour, Nova Scotia (Exhibit R-27; also contained in Investors' binder of Statutes, Regulations, Guidelines and Terms of Reference for Merits Phase Hearing).\n\n315.\n\nThe Respondent notes that various statutes, such as the *Financial Administration Act* and other statutes, among them the *Freedom of Information Act,* extend to a wide range of federal government entities, but do not apply to review panels.399 It has not been shown, however, that any of these broadly ranging statutes\u2014which do not in all cases apply to the same set of government institutions\u2014are intended to incorporate an exhaustive list of all the entities that Canada considers to be organs of government for the purposes of attribution in the context of State responsibility. In any event, the decisive issue is whether the JRP is part of the Government of Canada according to international law. As the commentary to the ILC Articles observes in relation to Article 4, \"a state cannot avoid responsibility for the conduct of a body which does in truth act as one of its organs merely by denying it that status under its own law\".400\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 276.\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session, Official Records of the General Assembly, fifty-sixth session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) chapter IV.E.2.\n\n316.\n\nCanada refers to several cases in which the acts of a private entity were not attributed to a government.401 In *Jan de Nul v Arab Republic of Egypt*, the tribunal found that the acts of the Suez Canal Authority were not attributable to Egypt. With respect to ILC Article 4, the same tribunal found that the Suez Canal Authority had been established in the context of a law that, in the words of the Tribunal, \"expressly insists on the commercial nature of the SCA activities and its autonomous budget\".402 With respect to Article 5, the tribunal concluded that the Suez Canal Authority \"[i]n its dealing with the Claimants during the tender process, acted like any contractor trying to achieve the best price for the services it was seeking. It did not act as a State entity\".403 In the present case, however, the JRP neither generally engaged in commercial activities nor did it display any commercial character in conducting its hearings.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 288, 295; Rejoinder, paras. 69-70.\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, para. 161.\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, para. 169.\n\n317.\n\nCanada submits that in *McKinney*,404 the Supreme Court of Canada decided that the fact that an entity is performing a public service and is subject to judicial review is not sufficient in itself to make it part of government for the purposes of being bound by the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.405 The *McKinney* case concerned employment decisions of a University. The Supreme Court of Canada found that universities in Canada are not part of government, and that they are not exercising governmental functions in their employment of academic staff. Rather, they are, by tradition and law, self-governing institutions that pursue their own goals.\n\n*McKinney v. University of Guelph*, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229 at p. 48, Exhibit R-384.\n\nRejoinder, para. 67, referring to *MicKenney v. University of Guelph*, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229 at p. 48.\n\n318.\n\nA JRP by contrast is established, and its members appointed, by governmental authorities to contribute to government decision-making, rather than pursuing its own mission.\n\n319.\n\nCanada has also drawn to the Tribunal's attention several NAFTA decisions concerning attribution of an entity's conduct to a state. In *Fireman's Fund*, however, the issue was whether Mexico had expropriated an investment. An informal working group of officials from various Mexican state agencies had been involved in consultations with stakeholders and making recommendations to the government. The tribunal agreed with the investor that regardless of how the domestic law of Mexico characterized the role of the working group, Mexico could not escape responsibility for an entity that acted on behalf of Mexico vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.406 On the evidence, however, the tribunal was not able to identify any commitment to investors made by the working group on behalf of Mexico. It seems that the officials from the government and the private parties with whom they engaged in discussions regarded the process as incomplete.407 In the present case, by contrast, the JRP was *de jure* an organ of Canada, equipped with a clear statutory role that included making formal and public recommendations to state authorities which the latter were obliged by law to consider - and indeed ended up accepting.\n\n*Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/1, Award, 17 July 2006, paras. 149-150.\n\n*Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/1, Award, 17 July 2006, para. 154.\n\n320.\n\nIn the *Gami* case, the tribunal rejected the claim as to attribution in part because certain measures depended on consultations involving private actors as well as government, and it was not clear in this context that the treatment of the investment was directly attributable to the government.408 There is no such mix of actors with respect to the JRP in the present case. The members of the JRP were all appointed by governments for the specific purpose of discharging a set of governmental duties connected with the environmental assessment of the project. The source of the claimed injury was a governmental decision-making process in which the JRP had a statutorily mandated and important role.\n\n*GAMI Investments Inc. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award, 15 November 2004, para. 110.\n\n321.\n\nEven if the JRP were not, by its nature, a part of the apparatus of the Government of Canada, the fact would remain that federal Canada and Nova Scotia both adopted its essential findings in arriving at the conclusion that the project should be denied approval under their environmental laws. Article 11 of the ILC Articles provides as follows:\n\nArticle 11\n\nConduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\n\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.409\n\nCited in Reply, para. 767.\n\n322.\n\nIt is possible to imagine a case in which a government arrives at the same conclusion as a recommendatory body, but in which the government does so by pursuing investigations and reasoning that are so distinctly its own that it might not be viewed as acknowledging and adopting the conduct of the recommendatory body. On the facts of the present case, however, Article 11 would establish the international responsibility of Canada even if the JRP were not one of its organs.\n\n323.\n\nThe Government of Canada's response to the JRP Report noted that the government had studied the Report \"carefully\" and concluded in its next sentence that: \"[t]he Government of Canada accepts the conclusion of the Joint Review Panel that the Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects that cannot be justified in the circumstances.\"410 In his expert report commissioned by the Government of Canada, Mr. Smith proposed the general proposition, that \"the Panel Report will provide ample analysis and reasoning for its recommendation. If accepted by the governments, the reasons for doing so are manifest on the face of the Panel Report.\"411 Mr. Smith's general proposition is applicable in the circumstances of this case. The JRP only made a specific finding of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation in respect of \"community core values\", and the reasonable inference is that the Government of Canada agreed with both the recommendation and the \"community core values\" approach that was at its foundation. There is no indication in the evidence of a level of independent fact-finding, legal analysis or other deliberation by the Government of Canada that would be inconsistent with the view that Canada was acknowledging and adopting the essential reasoning and conclusions of the JRP.\n\nQuoted in First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 532. On 13 December 2007, the federal Cabinet\u2014or in official terms, the Governor General in Council\u2014issued Order in Council PC 2007-1965 which stated that pursuant to s. 37(1.1)(a) of the *CEAA*, the Cabinet \"hereby approves the response of the Government of Canada to the Environmental Assessment Report of the Joint Review Panel on the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project 3.\"\n\nFirst Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 439.\n\n324.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Minister for the Environment informed Mr. Buxton by telephone that he had accepted the first recommendation of the JRP.412 In a separate letter of the same date, 20 November 2007, Minister Parent stated that the decision was ultimately for him to make as Minister, but that he had carefully considered the JRP Report and concluded that the project would have likely significant adverse effects after mitigation.413 Here again, the Tribunal concludes that the link between the findings and recommendations of the JRP and the Minister's final decision would be sufficient to constitute an acknowledgement and adoption for the purposes of Article 11 of the ILC Articles.\n\nTranscript of telephone conversation between Paul Buxton and Mark Parent, dated 20 November 2007, Exhibit R-560.\n\nLetter from Minister of the Environment and Labour to Paul Buxton, dated 20 November 2007, Exhibit R-331.\n\n**D. WHETHER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DECISION CAUSED ANY DAMAGE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent refers to NAFTA Article 1116's requirement that an investor must have \"incurred loss, or damage, by reason of, or arising out of\" the alleged breach and argues that measures not capable of causing loss or damage may not be considered by the Tribunal.414\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 299.\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the decision of the federal Government to accept the JRP's recommendation on 17 December 2007 did not cause the Investors loss or damage because one month earlier, on 20 November 2007, Nova Scotia's Minister of Environment and Labour had already rejected the proposal to construct and operate the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal.415 According to the Respondent, once Nova Scotia decided to reject the proposal, the project was effectively terminated.416 Although the federal Government had to make its own decision, \"the federal decision as to whether or not to issue any requested authorizations was academic\".417 The Respondent also rejects the Investors' assertion that \"the Federal Government decision to refuse to issue the authorizations and approvals requested by the Claimants \u2018caused additional damage to Bilcon'\".418\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 300; Letter from Minister of the Environment and Labour to Paul Buxton, dated 20 November 2007, Exhibit R-331.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 300.\n\nRejoinder, para. 83. *See also* First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 444.\n\nRejoinder, para. 86 (referring to Reply, para. 782).\n\n327.\n\nFinally, the Respondent denies the Investors' assertion that Nova Scotia and federal officials aligned their decisions.419 It argues that this \"speculation\" has no support and that \"Nova Scotia made and announced its decision before the federal Cabinet even met to consider the Federal Government response\".420\n\nRejoinder, para. 84.\n\nRejoinder, para. 85. *See also* Second Affidavit of Christopher Daly, para. 4.\n\n**2. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Investors contend that the federal and provincial governments coordinated their respective responses.421 It is the Investors' position that Canada's environmental legislation obliges the Respondent independently to determine the project and that therefore it cannot rely on Nova Scotia's decision to fulfill its statutory requirement.422 Moreover, \"Nova Scotia's acceptance of the JRP's first recommendation to reject Bilcon's application was not dispositive of the application\".423\n\nReply, paras. 773-775; Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 333.\n\nReply, para. 778. *See also* Reply, para. 777.\n\nReply, para. 779.\n\n329.\n\nIn the Investors' view, accepting the Respondent's argument \"would deny Bilcon the opportunity to attempt to persuade the federal Minister that his provincial counterpart ought to reconsider his decision\".424 Accordingly, the Investors submit that \"[a] review by the federal government of the irregularities and errors in the JRP report and process could have led to a reconsideration of the Nova Scotia decision.\"425 Likewise, the Investors assert that a difference of view between the governments could have been addressed through mitigation measures.\n\nReply, para. 777 (referring to Expert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 163).\n\nReply, paras. 779-780.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nCanada contends that the Investors' case is based on the allegation that the JRP Report did not adopt an approach compatible with federal Canada law, but the fact of the matter is that federal Canada's acceptance or rejection of the case was a moot point. Article 1116(1) of NAFTA only permits claims to be made where a breach has resulted in \"loss or damage\" to the claimant. Nova Scotia had already disposed of the project pursuant to the recommendations of the JRP which, Canada argues, were consistent with the more flexible requirements of the laws of Nova Scotia.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken careful note of the Respondent's jurisdictional objection pursuant to which the Investors' challenge of the decision by federal Canada fails because of the prior rejection of the Project at a provincial level. In view of the close links of this objection with the merits of the case, the Tribunal shall address this objection below, within Part VI.A.3(c)v of this Award.\n\n**E. WHETHER WILLIAM RALPH CLAYTON QUALIFIES AS AN INVESTOR**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that Mr. William Ralph Clayton does not qualify as an \"investor\" because\u2014as became apparent from the testimony of his son, Mr. William Richard Clayton, at the first day of the Hearing426\u2014he does not maintain ownership or direct financial interest in Bilcon of Delaware.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 13, lines 13-17.\n\n333.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent alleges that Mr. William Richard Clayton's testimony indicated that (i) Bilcon of Nova Scotia is wholly owned and controlled by Bilcon of Delaware427 and Mr. William Ralph Clayton has no ownership interest in it;428 (ii) Mr. William Ralph Clayton was neither a director of Bilcon of Delaware429 nor a director or officer of Bilcon of Nova Scotia;430 (iii) he did not actually run the business;431 and (iv) his financial interest in the quarry was \"indirect, because it is a family business and it is family money\".432 In the Respondent's view, such involvement of Mr. William Ralph Clayton does not qualify him as an investor under NAFTA, which would require direct or indirect ownership or control.433 \"[T]he fact that family money is involved cannot be enough under NAFTA\".434\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 5, lines 19-23 (citing Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 192, lines 18-21).\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 6, lines 4-7 (citing Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 192, lines 15-17).\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 6, lines 11-14 (citing Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 193, lines 1-3).\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, pp. 6-7 (citing Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 193, lines 4-11).\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 7, lines 9-16 (citing Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 193, lines 12-17).\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 8, lines 4-11 (citing Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 243, lines 16-25).\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, pp. 8-9, lines 12-25 and 1-8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 8, lines 22-23.\n\n334.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it raised this objection at the earliest opportunity during the Hearing, out of fairness to the Investors,435 so as to put them on notice and give them an opportunity to address the objection.436 The objection \"has arisen from the testimony\"437 of Mr. William Richard Clayton and was thus not untimely.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 14, line 2.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 13, lines 19-20.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 13, lines 13-17.\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, on the fourth day of the hearing, in light of answers provided by Mr. William Richard Clayton, counsel for the Respondent stated that Canada wished to raise a \"point of procedure\"; Canada was going to argue that Mr. William Ralph Clayton did not qualify as an Investor under the Article 1139 definition, which requires direct or indirect ownership or control of an investment. Counsel stated that Canada was raising it now in fairness to the Investors, rather than leaving it to closing argument. The Respondent suggested that the point was of negligible significance from a practical point of view as all the other claimants would remain as Investors, but wished to raise it as a matter of principle.\n\n**2. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Investors allege that the objection is untimely because, pursuant to Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"all jurisdictional defences must be raised not later than the filing of the statement of defence\".438 The Respondent filed the Statement of Defence on 18 December 2009\u2014four years before Canada had raised this new argument.439 The Investors also point out that information about Bilcon's corporate officers and directors is a matter of public record that was always available to the Respondent.440 Finally, the Investors observe that it was \"entirely inappropriate\" for Canada to have raised a jurisdictional issue in the middle of the witness phase of the hearing.441\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 124, lines 22-24.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 125, lines 13-15.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 125, lines 15-19.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 127, lines 15-19.\n\n337.\n\nThe Investors submit that evidence clearly indicates that Mr. William Ralph Clayton runs a \"family business. for the benefit of his children\"442 as well as \"funded the investment in Nova Scotia and. continues funding [its] continuing operation\".443 Moreover, \"the government was aware that the investment was being made by the Clayton family\".444 There is also evidence that Mr. William Ralph Clayton met with Minister Balser in Nova Scotia.445\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 125-126.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 126, lines 3-5.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 126, lines 7-8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 126, lines 17-22; Affidavit of William Richard Clayton, paras. 16-17.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Respondent's fifth point was brought to the Tribunal's attention in an unusual manner. However, the Tribunal has no doubt that Canada acted in good faith in raising the issue, including alerting the Investors to it as soon as counsel for Canada first appreciated that the issue was genuinely contentious. This was a very complex matter on the whole, and the inclusion or exclusion of one of the particular claimants might be of some formal significance, but it is far from being among the central issues.\n\n339.\n\nIt might be argued that Canada had reasonable notice of at least some aspects of the issue much earlier; for example, it is clear from the Investors' Memorial446 that the other individual claimants were investors and shareholders of Bilcon of Delaware, Inc., whereas no mention is made of Mr. William Ralph Clayton in either respect. The Memorial further mentions that Mr. William Ralph Clayton transferred his interest in the Clayton Group and reduced his workload in respect of its affairs in 2008.447 On the other hand, it is for the Investors as the claimants to make sure that the Tribunal has before it all relevant facts to verify that the conditions for the exercise of its jurisdiction are met. One might have expected the Investors to set out on their own volition the circumstances that should lead the Tribunal to conclude that Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an \"investor\" under NAFTA.\n\nMemorial, para. 4.\n\nMemorial, para. 34, including n.6 thereto.\n\n340.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is mindful of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal is firmly of the view that it cannot avoid the question of Mr. William Ralph Clayton's qualification as an investor on the basis that the Respondent would have been precluded from raising a jurisdictional objection. While Article 20 may operate in such a way in commercial arbitration proceedings, its application is problematic in proceedings under international law. The mandate of an investment tribunal is confined by the terms of the particular treaty under which the claim is brought. It is not open to the investor and the respondent in a particular case (tacitly) to rewrite these terms. In other words, the principle of preclusion cannot establish any jurisdiction where the underlying treaty confers none.\n\n341.\n\nIt is well established that tribunals constituted under international law are competent to rule on their jurisdiction even in the absence of a jurisdictional challenge. As the International Court of Justice held in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case, neither the claimant nor the respondent has a burden of proof in respect of jurisdictional questions. The ICJ held:\n\n[E]stablishment or otherwise of jurisdiction is not a matter for the parties but for the Court itself. Although a party seeking to assert a fact must bear the burden of proving it... this has no relevance for the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction, which is a \"question of law to be resolved in the light of the relevant facts\". That being so, there is no burden of proof to be discharged in the matter of jurisdiction. Rather, it is for the Court to determine from all the facts and taking into account all the arguments advanced by the Parties.448\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada)*, Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, 4 December 1998, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 432, paras. 37-38 (internal citations omitted).\n\n342.\n\nVarious arbitral tribunals under international law have similarly affirmed a duty of arbitral tribunals to verify their jurisdiction.449 Suffice it to refer to the award of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in the *Burton Marks and Harry Umann* case, in which the Tribunal stated that \"Claimant's argument that respondent has waived its jurisdictional objections by not raising them is unavailing. Article 21(3) of the Tribunal Rules does not purport to preclude the Tribunal from raising jurisdictional issues on its own motion.\"450\n\n*Rio Grande Irrigation and Land Company, Ltd. (Great Britain) v. United States*, 28 November 1923, VI UNRIAA, p. 135.\n\n*Burton Marks and Harry Umann v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, 29 June 1985, 8 Iran-U.S.CTR, p. 296.\n\n343.\n\nInvestment tribunals have likewise considered themselves under a duty to rule *sua sponte* on their jurisdiction.451 The tribunal in *Micula v. Romania* held:\n\nThe Tribunal understands its duty to determine its jurisdiction, including through examination of the jurisdictional requirements, *sua sponte*, if necessary, as it has an obligation to reject a claim if the record shows that jurisdiction is lacking. Or, put differently, a tribunal can rule on and decline its jurisdiction even where no objection to jurisdiction is raised if there are sufficient grounds to do so on the basis of the record. However, a tribunal's duty to ascertain jurisdiction *sua sponte* does not include an obligation to re-open the evidentiary proceedings, far less to launch its own investigation, unless there are compelling reasons to do so (such as where it has been impossible for a party to have made such an investigation itself or where the other party has concealed relevant facts or evidence).452\n\n*See* *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001, para. 101 (although the respondent did not challenge that the project qualified as an investment, the tribunal, *sua sponte*, examined the relevant agreement in light of Article 25(1) of the Washington Convention).\n\n*Ioan Micula et al. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, para. 65.\n\n344.\n\nIn the NAFTA context, the tribunal in *UPS v. Canada* affirmed that \"[it is] plain that a claimant party's mere assertion that a dispute is within the Tribunal's jurisdiction is not conclusive. It is the Tribunal that must decide.\"453 The present Tribunal therefore has no difficulty to affirm its competence to render a decision on the jurisdictional issue as to whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an \"investor\".\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 November 2002, para. 34.\n\n345.\n\nThe difficulty that the Tribunal does confront as a result of the late pleading of the issue is rather a procedural one. In the Tribunal's view, it would only be appropriate for it to make a determination in respect of Mr. William Ralph Clayton's quality as \"investor\" in the present Award if the matter were ripe for a decision. This would be the case if all relevant facts for the Tribunal's decision formed part of the record.\n\n346.\n\nPursuant to Article 1139 NAFTA, an investment must be either owned by the investor or \"controlled directly or indirectly\" by the investor:\n\ninvestment of an investor of a Party means an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party;\n\ninvestor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment;\n\n347.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that Mr. William Ralph Clayton does not formally hold any equity in any relevant entities of the Bilcon group. As far as the criterion of ownership is concerned, the issue is therefore ripe for a decision. However, the same cannot be said as far as the criterion of control is concerned.\n\n348.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidentiary record, the Tribunal has doubts as to Mr. William Ralph Clayton's exercise of \"control\" over the investment. He was not to be found among the directors, officers or recognized agents of Bilcon of Nova Scotia before the date of filing of the Notice of Arbitration.454 Neither the Directors' Register455 nor the Officers' Register456 make a reference to Mr. William Ralph Clayton. His name is not on the certificate of incorporation of Bilcon of Delaware among the elected directors either; it only bears his sons' names.457 The only time when Mr. William Ralph Clayton's name is present is on the letterhead of the Letter of Intent from Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. to Nova Stone Exporters, Inc., dated 28 March 2002. The letterhead reads \"Ralph Clayton & Sons\" but the letter predates the formation of Bilcon of Delaware. As the letter reads:\n\nThe purpose of this letter of intent (\"Letter\") is to set forth certain non-binding understandings and certain binding agreements between Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. (\"BD\") a New Jersey corporation *to be formed* and wholly owned by individuals of the Clayton family and Nova Stone Exporters, Inc., a corporation formed pursuant to the laws of Nova Scotia, Canada (\"NSE\").458\n\nCorporate Search for Bilcon of Nova Scotia, dated 2 October 2007, Exhibit C-12.\n\nDirectors' Register, undated, Exhibit C-16.\n\nOfficers' Register, undated, Exhibit C-17.\n\nBilcon of Delaware Certificate of Incorporation, dated 15 April 2002, Exhibit C-4.\n\nLetter of Intent from Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. to Nova Stone Exporters, Inc., dated 28 March 2002, Exhibit C-5 (emphasis added).\n\n349.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also considers that the evidentiary record does not exclude any reasonable possibility that Mr. William Ralph Clayton exercised indirect control in other\u2014less formal\u2014ways, as the Investors contended at the hearing.\n\n350.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal feels that it would benefit from further evidence before arriving at a final determination. The Tribunal therefore reserves its position as to whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an \"investor\" for purposes of NAFTA. Accordingly, since the Tribunal has not been in a position positively to affirm its jurisdiction in respect of Mr. William Ralph Clayton, the Tribunal's decisions in respect of the merits of the case, below, do not apply to him.\n\n351.\n\nIt might turn out that, in the aftermath of this Award, the Parties can settle on compensation without further proceedings before this Tribunal, or that both Parties will concur that it is not necessary or economical to further litigate the issue of the procedural status of Mr. William Ralph Clayton. Alternatively, the point could be further argued and finally adjudicated in the context of the next phase of the proceedings.\n\n**VI. THE MERITS OF THE INVESTORS' CLAIMS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe following sections summarize the Parties' submissions on the legal issues that pertain to the merits of the dispute. In short, the Investors claim that the Respondent has breached its NAFTA obligations set out in Articles 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment); 1102 (National Treatment); and 1103 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment). The Respondent rejects the Investors' arguments and disputes the Investors' interpretation of these NAFTA obligations.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal does not undertake to illustrate here all the arguments set out by the Parties. Rather, it selects the most salient arguments for purposes of its decisionmaking and the emphases put on each issue by the Parties.\n\n**A. NAFTA ARTICLE 1105\u2014MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Sources of Law that Apply to NAFTA Article 1105(1)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nIn the Investors' view, the fair and equitable treatment protection granted in NAFTA Article 1105(1) is an autonomous standard, not limited to requiring treatment only in accordance with customary international law. The Investors also submit that the Tribunal in interpreting Article 1105(1) is not limited to customary law and must apply other sources of law, as enumerated in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.459\n\nReply, paras. 170-195.\n\n355.\n\nThe Investors accept that according to NAFTA Article 1131(2), the Tribunal must apply the Notes of Interpretation issued by the Free Trade Commission (\"FTC Notes\"). The Investors argue that the FTC Notes consider customary international law as a ceiling or cap on the liability of the host state under Article 1105. According to the FTC Notes, a NAFTA tribunal must therefore \"check customary international law to ensure that its interpretation of NAFTA Article 1105 as applied to the facts does not lead to liability on the part of the host state for actions or omissions that are not *also* violations of custom.\"460\n\nReply, para. 242.\n\n356.\n\nIt is the Investors' position, however, that the Tribunal's interpretation based on the FTC Notes still must not override or exclude the normal application of rules of interpretation.461 That is, the Tribunal should rely on the customary rules of treaty interpretation enshrined in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.462 Despite these views on interpretation, the Investors submit that, in any event, the autonomous fair and equitable treatment standard and the customary international law standard have converged.463\n\nReply, para. 174.\n\nReply, para. 174.\n\nReply, paras. 205-209.\n\n**(b) The Content and Scope of NAFTA Article 1105(1)**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Investors submit that the fair and equitable treatment standard stipulated in Article 1105(1) is guided by the principle of \"good faith\" and requires Respondent to:\n\na) Act in accordance with basic fairness and fundamental justice; b) Act in a non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory manner; c) Respect foreign investors' legitimate expectations; d) Deal with foreign investors according to basic principles of openness and transparency; e) Ensure that it not abuse its rights in regulating foreign investors; and f) Provide foreign investors with a basic level of security of the legal and business environment.464\n\nReply, para. 210. *See also* Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 18, lines 10-19.\n\n358.\n\nIn the Investors' view, a violation of the fair and equitable treatment does not require a breach of every element stated above. A breach of any one of the elements suffices.465 The Investors further submit that undue delay can constitute a breach of international law.466\n\nReply, para. 221.\n\nReply, para. 214; Application for Review of Judgment No. 158 of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, [1973] ICJ Reports, para 92, Exhibit CA-225; Judgment No. 2867 of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization, Advisory Opinion, 1 February 2012, para 30, Exhibit CA-227. *See als* o Reply, paras. 215-217.\n\n359.\n\nIt is the Investors' position that the Respondent confuses \"arbitrariness\" with (lack of) \"fair and equitable treatment.\"467 Referring to the decisions of the tribunals in *Thunderbird* and *Waste Management II*, the Investors maintain that fair and equitable treatment requires the Respondent not only to act in a non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory manner but also to act reasonably.468 The Investors also argue that \"the fair and equitable treatment obligation includes the obligation to protect legitimate expectations\".469\n\nReply, para. 228.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 77; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award, 26 January 2006; *Waste Management, Inc. v.

Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 25 April 2005. *See also* Memorial, paras. 341-346.\n\n360.\n\nThe Investors also refer to the requirement of full protection and security enumerated in Article 1105,470 stating that, in their view, it requires a host country to exercise reasonable care to protect investments against injury by private parties.471 The Investors also assert that recent tribunals have found that the obligation to provide full protection and security includes an obligation on governments to provide a stable legal and business environment to foreign investors.472\n\nMemorial, para. 357.\n\nMemorial, para. 357.\n\nMemorial, para. 364.

Lack of Due Process, Natural Justice and Fairness and Reasonableness Prior the JRP Panel Process\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Investors submit that the DFO carried out the following actions on its own and in collaboration with the NSDEL in violation of due process, natural justice and fairness and reasonableness.478\n\nReply, para. 481. *See also* Memorial, paras. 459-463.\n\n365.\n\nFirst, the NSDEL and the DFO imposed Blasting Conditions on the Investors' project without authority to do so.479 It is the Investors' position that the imposition of condition 10(h) was \"superfluous\"480 and condition 10(i) was beyond the jurisdiction of the federal government.481 The Investors refer to the similar Tiverton Harbour project where test blasting was underway without restriction.482 Likewise, the Investors maintain that the Blasting Conditions imposed were impossible to meet or fulfill despite their attempts to seek guidance on amending them.483 The conditions blocked the Investors' ability to blast and deprived them of an ability to seek necessary information.484\n\nReply, paras. 482-484; NSDEL Approval to Nova Stone Exporters, Inc., Construction and operation of a Quarry, dated 30 April 2002, Exhibit C-31.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 14, lines 8-13.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 14; Reply, para. 484.\n\nReply, para. 484; Expert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 84.\n\nReply, paras. 481 and 485.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 80, lines 1-5.\n\n366.\n\nThirdly, the Investors argue that the agencies imposed blast setback distances based on models they knew were inappropriate. The DFO staff acknowledged that the excessive setback distance of 500m was not suited for the Investors' project; yet, the DFO did not share this information with the Investors.485 To the contrary, DFO officials, on six occasions, refused to explain or justify these setback distances.486\n\nReply, paras. 488 and 481; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, requiring the proponent to obtain authorization under s. 32 of the *Fisheries Act*, dated 29 May 2003, Exhibit C-249.\n\nInvestors were not told until November 2004 about the truth concerning the setback calculations and DFO assessment on mitigation and whales; Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 68.\n\n367.\n\nFourthly, the Investors take issue with the NSDEL and DFO's decision to scope the quarry and the marine terminal into one project despite knowing that they lacked a legal trigger.487 As counsel for the Investors argued at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits: \"At the time Minister Anderson referred the Bilcon marine terminal and the Bilcon quarry to a JRP, federal officials in both the DFO and CEA Agency knew that no lawful basis had been established to include the quarry in a federal environmental assessment of the marine terminal.\"488 The Investors also submit that the decision failed to conform to the DFO standard practice from 1999 through 2004 \"that the project component included in the *CEAA* assessment would be only the immediate activity for which a DFO permit was required\".489 They argue that \"[t]he DFO knew that a decision to scope in the quarry was contrary to environmental assessment practices across Canada, but decided to do so in order to \"share the grief\" with the Province of Nova Scotia\".490 According to the Investors, Minister Thibault later acknowledged that \"[t]he federal government had no jurisdiction over the quarry itself\u2014only its possible impact on marine life and habitat\".491 Finally, the Investors submit that the DFO should have consulted the Investors before scoping both pieces of the project.492\n\nReply, paras. 481, 490-493. *See also* Memorial, paras. 487-497.

The Investors argue that this was a clear violation of Canadian practice as set out in the *Red Hill* decision, *see* Memorial, para. 506.\n\nReply, para. 492 (referring to Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 57).\n\nMemorial, para. 521 (referring to Journal note by Bruce Hood, dated Fall 2007, and arguing that Mr. Hood stated \"that the CEA Agency and the NSDEL placed pressure on the DFO to include the quarry within their scoping of the Whites Point Quarry environmental assessment\", p. 801617, Exhibit C-367).\n\nReply, para. 493 (referring to Robert Thibault, \"Thibault rejects proposed quarry\", Digby Courier, 26 May 2004, Exhibit C-511).\n\nReply, paras. 481, 493. Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 24-25.\n\n368.\n\nFifthly, the agencies needlessly imposed requirements on the Investors based on purported concerns about the safety of various species of whales and salmon while contemporaneous communications among DFO staff indicate that the agency knew there were no whales in the area and that their concerns about Inner Bay of Fundy (\"iBoF\") salmon were unwarranted.493 The Investors note that the DFO expressed \"no concern about iBoF salmon to the proponents of the nearby Tiverton quarry when approving its blasting activities directly in the water\".494\n\nReply, paras. 494, 497; E-mail from Jerry Conway to Jim Ross, dated 2 December 2002, Exhibit C-605.\n\nReply, para. 500; Response to Undertaking 31 by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Exhibit C-417. *See also* Memorial, para. 495.\n\n369.\n\nThe Investors take issue with every aspect of the referral to the JRP, noting that a JRP is \"rare in the extreme.\"495 Considering what the governments knew at the time of the referral, the referral was, in the Investors' view, *ultra vires*. No other marine terminal or quarry had been referred to a JRP before.496\n\nHearing Transcript, 30 October 2013, p. 44, line 20; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 30 October 2013, p. 44, lines 21-25.\n\n370.\n\nThe Investors further submit that the Respondent's failure to ensure that appropriate persons were appointed as members of the JRP constituted a breach of natural justice. According to the Investors, the JRP \"was not comprised of persons with the requisite professional credentials and experience\"497 and these persons were not \"\u2018comfortable' with standard environmental assessment processes and proceedings in the Province of Nova Scotia and Canada\".498 Moreover, the Investors argue that\n\nthe Respondent did not appoint candidates that were \"unbiased and free from any conflict of interest relative to the project\" but deliberately chose panel members who were manifestly biased. In this regard, the Investors recall that two of the panel members, Mr. Fournier and Mr. Muecke, had previous involvement with a provincial environmental activist group, the Ecology Action Centre, and the third member, Ms. Grant, was an advocate for greater community participation in environmental decision-making.499\n\nMemorial, para. 461; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 515.\n\nMemorial, para. 463; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 514.\n\nMemorial, para. 462; R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Robert Fournier, Exhibit C-285; R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Gunter Muecke, Exhibit C-286.\n\nii. Lack of Due Process, Natural Justice and Fairness and Reasonableness During the JRP Process\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nThe Investors argue that a number of incidents during, or features of, the JRP process indicate a lack of due process, natural justice, and fairness and reasonableness. First, the Investors maintain that the JRP misused the Draft EIS Guidelines which had been prepared by the CEA Agency and the NSDEL. The Investors argue that the JRP misused the mandatory public scoping sessions on the Draft EIS Guidelines by relying upon \"the activist opinions of the public advocated to in effect dispense with the Draft EIS Guidelines entirely\".500 In particular, the Final EIS Guidelines imposed by the JRP required the Investors to satisfy the Panel with \"perfect certainty\" about issues not in the Terms of Reference.\n\nMemorial, para. 465; Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines for the Review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, dated March 2005, s. 6.6, Exhibit C-168; E-mail from Phil Zamora to Derek McDonald, undated, Exhibit C-441.\n\n372.\n\nAccording to the Investors, JRP's misuse of the public scoping sessions included disparaging the United States identity of the Investors, making misleading comments about the NAFTA, distorting the precautionary principle, discussed further below, and expanding the definition of \"traditional knowledge\" issues from aboriginal issues to the current views of all residents in the area.501 These errors could have been corrected by other authorities of the Respondent, but they were not.\n\nMemorial, para. 465; Transcript of Scoping Meeting #1 in Sandy Cove, dated 6 January 2005, pp. 77-78, 118, Exhibit C-116.\n\n373.\n\nIn this context, the Investors also submit that the JRP: abused its discretion by altering the standard ecosystem approach analysis to compel the Investors to address factors that were functionally impossible to address at the preliminary planning stage of the project502; deviated from Canadian law and normal EIS requirements by imposing a review of \"cumulative effects\" that forced the Investors to examine purely hypothetical propositions and imposed a \"spurious standard of \u2018induced' activities\";503 insisted on specific and excessively detailed facts and thereby ignored the dynamic character of projects;504 disregarded the ordinary legal standard in EAs and instead demanded \"perfect certainty\" from Bilcon;505 gave disproportionate weight to \"aboriginal traditional knowledge\";506 sent \"numerous, onerous \u2018information requests' to Bilcon leading to an EIS that exceeded 3000 pages\";507 failed to question the Investors' many experts; and facilitated the summary dismissal of Bilcon's adaptive management approach.\n\nMemorial, para. 466.\n\nMemorial, para. 467.\n\nMemorial, para. 468; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 357.\n\nMemorial, para. 469; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 360.\n\nMemorial, para. 470.\n\nMemorial, para. 471; JRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 16, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n374.\n\nThe Investors also submit that the JRP violated their due process rights, natural justice, fairness and reasonableness by not sending presentations of the regulatory agencies and experts' CVs to the Investors in advance of the hearing, thereby depriving Bilcon of the opportunity to prepare for the hearing; by conducting the hearing in a \"biased and prejudicial manner\" toward the Investors, evidenced by the actions set out in the preceding paragraph; by denying the Investors the opportunity to address the concept of \"community core values\", despite its obvious importance to the JRP's view of the Project; and by the JRP's dismissive attitude toward the EIS and a series of irrelevant information requests.508\n\nReply, para. 501. *See also* Reply, paras. 502-507.\n\n375.\n\nThe Investors also criticize the JRP's use of \"cumulative effects\" during the JRP proceedings and in its final report. In the Investors' view, the Panel applied an \"inappropriate and indeed illegal concept of \u2018cumulative effects'\";509 and interpreted \"cumulative effects\" in such a way that the Investors had to include all \"past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects\" in their EIS, which led to unreasonable information requests by the JRP. Still, the JRP rejected the Investors' review of cumulative effects not on the basis of what it had covered in its EIS but what it had omitted:510 Further, the Investors contend that the JRP ignored the follow-up and monitoring programs and abused its discretion by assessing how a hypothetical breakwater could \"alter the local marine ecosystem\", without giving the Investors the opportunity to discuss it.511\n\nMemorial, para. 478.\n\nMemorial, para. 478; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 431.\n\nMemorial, para. 480; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 472.\n\n376.\n\nAt the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, the Investors highlighted that even if the Tribunal were to dismiss the actions of the JRP as not attributable to the Respondent, the events and behavior outlined above and elaborated upon below could have been corrected by authorities of the Respondent; the failure to do so is, in the Investors' view, a violation of the obligation of full protection and security.512\n\nHearing Transcript, 30 October 2013, p. 79, lines 15-17.\n\niii. Lack of Due Process, Natural Justice and Fairness and Reasonableness in the JRP Report\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nAccording to the Investors, the content of and conclusions drawn in the JRP Report constitute violations of their due process rights, natural justice, fairness and reasonableness. First, the Investors maintain that the recommendations made by the JRP did not accord with the information including expert information provided to the JRP. Secondly, the JRP ignored important scientific and other information provided by the Investors. Thirdly, the JRP failed to apply the legal and regulatory requirements of the environmental scheme for an assessment. As a fourth point, the JRP's conclusions were not based on science or fact. As a fifth point, the JRP used and applied unknown rules and standards, in particular the \"artificially concocted\" concept of \"community core values\". As a sixth point, the JRP unduly focused on the reasons why the Whites Point project might not work, and showed no interest in how the project could work. As a seventh point, six out of the seven recommendations of the JRP are general policy recommendations, falling outside the scope of the Terms of Reference. As an eighth point, the JRP failed to consider and propose mitigation measures \"listed in the *CEAA* as a factor to be considered when a Panel makes recommendations\".513 Lastly, the JRP brushed over strong community support, reflected in a petition by more than 30 percent of the local population.\n\nReply, para. 520. *See also* Reply, para. 521.\n\n378.\n\nIn this regard, the Investors further submit that \"[t]he JRP failed to assert how its conclusions conformed to the CEA Agency's Guidelines for Reference Panels\".514 The Investors also argue that the JRP had no jurisdiction or authority to recommend the rejection of the Whites Point project based on the notion of \"community core values\" because this notion has no basis in the Constitution of Canada, the administrative law framework, the environmental legislation or any other relevant law. Moreover, the Investors submit that they were unaware that \"community core values\" were distinct from general socioeconomic concerns, which they addressed at length during the hearing. The Investors maintain they could not have reasonably foreseen that the EA would turn on this irrelevant consideration. The Investors further submit that the use of \"community core values\" \"highlight[s] the JRP's determination to give a preferential voice to those in the community who opposed the project\".\n\nReply, para. 509.\n\n379.\n\nThe Investors argue that the \"JRP manifestly misunderstood the role of a JRP\".515 In the Investors' view, the JRP should be \"engaged in the planning stage of a project, not at the detailed design stage. The JRP unfairly demanded that the Investors provide detailed designs, purporting to assume the role of an industrial regulator\".516\n\nReply, para. 513.\n\nReply, para. 513; Supplemental Witness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 58.\n\n380.\n\nThe Investors also argue that the JRP incorrectly applied the two crucial concepts of adaptive management and the precautionary principle. The JRP mentioned adaptive management only in a cursory fashion.517 The JRP Report criticized the Investors for its reliance on adaptive management even though the interpretation and use of this concept was correct \"and had been used in environmental assessments of three other contemporaneous projects: Elmsdale, Glenholme and Lovett Road and Miller's Creek Gypsum Mine Expansion\".518 With regard to the precautionary principle, the Investors contend that\n\nthe Panel applied a patently incorrect definition notwithstanding the fact that this principle is defined in the *Nova Scotia Environment Act,* and had been correctly applied previously by Dr. Fournier when he chaired the JRP in the Sable Gas Review. The proper application reflects the fact that the precautionary principle does not require scientific certainty. The Whites Point JRP did not recognize this and interpreted the principle as requiring \"that a proposed action will not lead to serious or irreversible environmental damage; verifiable scientific research and high-quality information\".519\n\nReply, para. 515; Environmental Impact Study Guidelines for the Review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, dated 31 March 2005, p. 31491, Exhibit R-210.\n\nReply, para. 515. *See also* Reply, paras. 516-517.\n\nReply, para. 518; Second Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 218-219. *See also* Reply, para. 519.\n\n381.\n\nThe Investors argue that the JRP Report ignored evidence that was before it by failing to acknowledge the Investors' commitment to exceed regulators' requirements to mitigate the potential for any significant adverse environmental effects.\n\n382.\n\nThe Investors contend that the Report unfairly criticized them for their use of ANFO in blasting,520 even though the DFO admitted that blasting with ANFO could be permitted and that this type of blasting was not uncommon and was employed at various other industrial projects.521\n\nReply, para. 523; JRP Report, dated October 2007, pp. 5, 34, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nReply, para. 523.\n\n383.\n\nThe Investors submit that the \"JRP report also ignored numerous government regulators\",522 such as Natural Resources Canada and Health Canada,523 \"who praised Bilcon for the thoroughness and detailed nature of the evidence it provided\".524 The JRP Report also ignored the Investors' significant community outreach and agreement to \"comply with lighting standards at night requested by government to protect migrating birds\".525\n\nReply, para. 524.\n\nReply, para. 524(a) and (b).\n\nReply, para. 524.\n\nReply, paras. 524(c) and (d).\n\niv. Lack of Due Process, Natural Justice and Fairness and Reasonableness After the Issuance of the JRP Report\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe Investors argue that they were denied due process by federal and provincial ministers vested with the authority to approve or reject their project. They maintain that the ministers refused to hear them and that such refusal is a denial of natural justice. Moreover, in the Investors' view, the federal minister's decision, which according to them, relied upon \"community core values\" by adopting the JRP recommendation, fell outside his jurisdiction and statutory mandate.526 The Investors also submit that both ministers gave a \"rubber stamp\" to the Panel's recommendation. \"By doing so, the ministers failed to conduct their own independent analysis as required under s. 37(1)(b) of *CEAA* \".527 Thus, the Investors contend that neither minister had a proper basis upon which to make his decision.\n\nReply, para. 530; Expert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 167.\n\nMemorial, para. 485.\n\nv. Two-Track Process/Lack of Full Transparency, Fairness and Honesty toward Bilcon\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Investors argue that their \"legitimate and reasonable expectations that [they] would be dealt with transparently and honestly were not met\".528 In particular, DFO and provincial regulators misled them to believe that it would be possible to conduct test blasting at the 3.9 ha quarry when this was not so; DFO continued to lead them into believing that the 3.9 ha quarry could become operational; and, DFO misled them to believe that the environmental assessment would take the form of a comprehensive study.529 On the latter point, according to the Investors, regulators notified a lawyer for a citizens group that the review would be conducted by a JRP in July 2003 but only informed the Investors in September 2003.530\n\nReply, para. 532.\n\nReply, para. 532. *See also* Reply, paras. 533-536.\n\nReply, para. 535; E-mail from Stephen Chapman to Bruce Young, dated 7 July 2003, Exhibit C-678; Letter from Stephen Chapman to Paul Buxton, regarding the environmental assessment process, dated 10 September 2003, Exhibit C-75.\n\nvi. Abuse of Process\n--------------------\n\n386.\n\nThe Investors submit that they were subjected to \"abuses of process by regulators and the JRP, all of which failed to respect the regulatory process\".531 The Investors refer to the DFO's involvement in assessing the 3.9 ha quarry without adequate legal basis.532 In particular, the Investors submit that: DFO Minister Thibault's office \"inject[ed] itself\" into the regulatory process and took actions to prevent regulators from approving blasting plans;533 the JRP failed to adhere to its role as an assessor of the project, rather than of EA in Nova Scotia more generally;534 Dr. Fournier saw himself as a reformer who improperly saw his task as coming up with general policy recommendations;535 all seven recommendations by the JRP exceeded its TOR;536 and the federal Minister of the Environment abused and exceeded his jurisdiction by rejecting the project based on the JRP's recommendation of a significant adverse environmental effect on community core values.537\n\nReply, para. 537.\n\nReply, paras. 538-539. *See also* Memorial, paras. 487-496.\n\nReply, para. 540; E-mail from Wayne Stobo to Faith Scattolon, dated 27 June 2002, pp. 801717-801718, Exhibit C-256.\n\nReply, para. 541; NSDEL Power Point Presentation titled Response to Panel Report on Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal, dated 13 November 2007, Exhibit C-654; E-mail from Mike Murphy to Mark G.

Arbitrariness and Discrimination\n-------------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Investors argue that decisions made both by regulators and the JRP were arbitrary and discriminatory and that they suffered prejudice as a result.538 The Investors refer to the imposition of \"impossible\" conditions for the operation of the quarry \"in a highly politicized process\",539 and to the setting of blasting setback distances.540 With regard to the latter, the Investors assert that under Canadian law the arbitrary distances would be considered inappropriately arbitrary.541\n\nReply, para. 545.\n\nReply, para. 546.\n\nReply, para. 547.\n\nReply, para. 548; Expert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 97.\n\n388.\n\nIn addition, the Investors take issue with the involvement of Minister Thibault who, in their view, used his position to exaggerate and misconstrue the factors involved in deciding whether the project should undergo a comprehensive study or other review.542 The Investors further argue that the Minister's public statements constituted an \"unwarranted interference that inflamed the situation and polarized public opinion\".543 Referring to Mr. Hood's journal and correspondence where it was stated that the \"file is extremely important to the Minister,\" that it was \"such a politically hot file,\" and that the Minister wants the \"process dragged out as long as possible,\" the Investors maintain that political motivations inappropriately directed the process.544\n\nMemorial, para. 500; Letter from Robert Thibault to David Anderson, dated 26 June 2003, Exhibit C-61. *See also* Memorial, paras. 501-506.\n\nMemorial, para. 507.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 70-71.\n\n389.\n\nIt is the Investors' position that the JRP was wrongly antagonistic toward them during the proceedings.545 The Investors argue that the values of the majority of community members who supported the project were ignored.546 Moreover, the Investors submit that the JRP reasoning suggests an \"undercurrent of xenophobia or anti-Americanism\".547\n\nMemorial, para. 509; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 103.\n\nMemorial, para. 510; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 234; Letter from Cindy Nesbitt to Stephen Chapman, dated 7 December 2004, Exhibit C-557.\n\nMemorial, para. 511; First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 436; Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 40, lines 5-7.\n\n390.\n\nThe Investors contend that the anti-NAFTA and anti-American sentiment was fuelled by so called \"citizen-advocates\" and politicians who testified at the public hearing548 and that the JRP was preoccupied with the implications of the project under the NAFTA:\n\nThe involvement of DFAIT in an environmental assessment process was novel, and together with an outside independent NAFTA expert's report, emphasizes how the Joint Review Panel members' interest in the NAFTA did not stem from their own knowledge or experiences with the implications of the NAFTA and its connection to environmental assessments for quarry projects. Thus, Bilcon was entitled to have the legal and regulatory criteria, and related jurisprudence and practice, applied to it in a manner no less favorable than to domestic investors who were proponents under the regulatory scheme as well as investors who are nationals of non-NAFTA states.549\n\nMemorial, paras. 516-517, 519-520.\n\nMemorial, paras. 513, 515.\n\nviii. Delay\n-----------\n\n391.\n\nThe Investors argue that it was clear to officials that the federal minister's desire was to delay the regulatory process as long as possible.550 Moreover, they contend that the delay they experienced can be contrasted to the treatment afforded to the proponents of the Tiverton quarry \"where Minister Thibault's office assured them it would do all it could to speed up the process\".551 There, the governments moved the project through rapidly to meet funding deadlines, according to the Investors.552\n\nReply, para. 550. *See also* Memorial, paras. 521-525.\n\nReply, para. 552; Journal note by Bruce Hood, disclosing a statement made by Minister Robert Thibault evidencing his use of powers to lengthen the environmental assessment of the Whites Point Quarry, undated, p. 801619, Exhibit C-370.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 46, lines 5-15.\n\nix. Full Protection and Security and Stable Legal Environment\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe Investors argue that the Respondent failed to accord them full protection and security by the following acts/omissions: not takings steps to protect them from discriminatory and arbitrary treatment in the environmental regulatory process;553 not following its own laws with respect to governmental regulatory authority over the proposed quarry;554 and failing to accord the investors a fair hearing and reasonable decision with regard to the JRP process and Report.555 In this context, the Investors submit that Respondent should have been aware of the impact of the JRP's allegedly xenophobic attitude toward them on the security of their investment.556 The Investors further submit that:\n\nAt no time did DFAIT ever take steps to ensure that the Joint Review Panel protected the fairness, integrity and due process rights of the Investors and the Investment, nor did it ever advise the Joint Review Panel to ensure that discriminatory or unfair evidence was not to be used.\n\nInstead, DFAIT's participation in the Joint Review Panel's public hearings fueled the anti- Americanism that prevailed throughout Bilcon's environmental assessment...\n\nDFAIT's participation facilitated and endorsed the Joint Review Panel's pre-occupation with the impacts of the NAFTA on Bilcon's project and amplified the obsession of the environmental activists who promoted an anti-American tone, against Bilcon's American parent company, and the export of aggregate to the United States, thus depriving Bilcon of a secure investment environment which Canada was obligated by the NAFTA to provide in its environmental assessment of Bilcon's project.557\n\nMemorial, para. 526.\n\nMemorial, para. 527.\n\nMemorial, para. 527.\n\nMemorial, para. 530. *See also* paras. 528-529.\n\nMemorial, paras. 531, 532, 535.\n\n393.\n\nFinally, the Investors submit that CEA Agency's officials were not free to express their honest opinions about the project and therefore the investment climate was \"not a stable environment free from political interference\".558\n\nReply, para. 557; E-mail from Stephen Chapman to Derek McDonald, stating that Whites Point Quarry related issues should not be documented, dated 11 June 2003, Exhibit C-404.\n\nx. Legitimate Expectations under Article 1105\n---------------------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe Investors also argue that their legitimate expectations to operate the quarry were frustrated.559 Those legitimate expectations were formed from the extensive encouragement of Nova Scotia officials to invest in a quarry in the area, but rejected by the acts reviewed above.\n\nReply, para. 563.\n\n395.\n\nThe Investors rely on the three factors stipulated in the *Mobil* award for establishing that the events elaborated above met the test for a NAFTA Article 1105 breach of the Investors' legitimate expectations.560 First, according to the Investors, a \"permit is a clear and explicit representation to induce investment\".561 They argue that a \"permit grant implies political support and is an explicit representation that something will be permitted\".562 Thus, the Investors argue that the permit induced the investment and \"[h]ad Nova Scotia not granted the Permit, they would have invested in their alternate site\".563\n\nReply, para. 566, referring to *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. & Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, para. 152. The three factors enumerated by the tribunal are that the treatment occurs against the background of clear and explicit representations made by or attributable to the NAFTA host State in order to induce the investment; that such representations were made by reference to an objective standard, reasonably relied on by the investor; and that these representations were subsequently repudiated by the NAFTA host State.\n\nReply, para. 566(i).\n\nReply, para. 569.\n\nReply, para. 570.\n\n396.\n\nSecondly, the Investors argue that an investor should be able to reasonably and objectively rely upon a permit. As the Investors observe, Nova Stone's obtaining the permit was shown to be a pre-condition for capital contributions by the Investor.564\n\nReply, para. 571; Letter of Intent from Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. to Nova Stone Exporters, Inc., Article 6(a) and (b), dated 28 March 2002, Exhibit C-5.\n\n397.\n\nThirdly, Nova Scotia and Canada \"repudiated the permit by refusing to allow its conditions to be met\".565 This allegedly occurred in two steps: First, the Respondent interpreted the conditions in a manner that made them impossible to fulfill. Secondly, it refused to allow the 3.9 ha quarry to operate once the project was referred to a JRP (purportedly because it had been subsumed by the larger project).566\n\nReply, para. 571(iii).\n\nReply, para. 572. *See also* Reply, paras. 629-630.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Sources of Law that Apply to NAFTA Article 1105(1)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, according to the FTC Notes, which are, in the Respondent's view, binding on and determinative for NAFTA tribunals in respect of the interpretation of Article 1105(1), Article 1105(1) requires application of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.567\n\nRejoinder, para. 90. *See also* Rejoinder, paras. 91-105.\n\n**(b) The Burden of Proving Breach of NAFTA Article 1105(1)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors bear the burden of proving that the conduct in question breaches the treaty obligation contained in Article 1105(1) as reflected in customary international law.568\n\nRejoinder, para. 107. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 106.\n\n**(c) The Content and Scope of NAFTA Article 1105(1)**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondent first submits that the threshold for a breach of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment under Article 1105(1) is high. In particular, the Respondent refers to the decision of the *Mobil* tribunal, which concluded that\n\nArticle 1105(1) \u2018protects against egregious behaviour' such as \u2018conduct attributable to a NAFTA Party and harmful to a claimant that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, or is discriminatory and exposes a claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.569\n\nRejoinder, para. 108 (referring to *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. & Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, paras. 152-153); Rejoinder, paras. 109-116.\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that NAFTA Article 1105(1) does not include a stand-alone obligation protecting legitimate expectations, although legitimate expectations may be relevant to determining whether a measure amounts to the type of egregious conduct that would breach Article 1105(1).570 In the Respondent's view, the *CMS Gas*, *Rumeli*, and *Azurix* awards overstated that the minimum standard of treatment has converged with the FET standard. Rather, the *Glamis* and *Cargill* tribunals rightly stated that the jurisprudence relevant to a NAFTA Article 1105 interpretation is that which applies the customary minimum standard of treatment.571 According to the Respondent, this principle should likewise be extended to the Investors' allegations as to an obligation of transparency owed by the Respondent.\n\nRejoinder, para. 156.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 233-235.\n\n**(d) The Alleged Breach of NAFTA Article 1105(1)**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors have failed to establish that any of the measures about which they have complained constitutes a breach of its Article 1105(1) obligations.572 The Respondent divides its response into five categories: measures taken by the DFO and the NSDEL prior to the JRP process; the joint decision of the federal Minister of the Environment and the province of Nova Scotia on the selection of members of the JRP; the acts of the JRP prior to the issuance of its Report; the approach taken by the JRP in its Report; and, the government decisions in responding to the JRP Report. In the context of these categories, the Respondent addresses the Investors' arguments regarding lack of transparency, abuse of process, arbitrariness and discrimination, and delay. The Respondent addresses separately the Investors' arguments on full protection and security and a stable legal environment.573\n\nRejoinder, paras. 117-160.\n\nRejoinder, para. 118.\n\ni. The Measures Taken by the DFO and the NSDEL Prior to the JRP Process\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the DFO set the Blasting Conditions in accordance with the procedure in its Blasting Guidelines and its legal authority under s. 37(1) of the *Fisheries Act*.574 It is the Respondent's position that the calculation of the setback for Nova Stone's quarry was based on \"a *bona fide* concern over the potential impacts of Nova Stone's blasting activity on endangered iBoF salmon and whales that could be found in close proximity to the site\".575 The fact that DFO's opinion on this issue evolved does not, in the Respondent's view, challenge the validity of its initial concerns or suggest any breach of Article 1105(1), nor does disagreement with DFO's Blasting Conditions,576 because the quarrying activities on the 3.9 ha were \"tied to the advancement of the larger project\", which was already under an EA.577 According to the Respondent, this linkage between the 3.9 ha quarry and the larger project was also the reason why the DFO decided not to discuss mitigation measures with Nova Stone on its 3.9 ha quarry in the form of revised setback distances in the summer of 2003.578\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 338; Rejoinder, para. 124.\n\nRejoinder, para. 125. The Respondent maintains that the minister did not know that the calculations were wrong before making the JRP referral; *see* Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 260; Hearing Transcript, 29 October 2013, p. 211, lines 11-17.\n\nRejoinder, para. 125 (citing *S.D.

Thus, because Nova Scotia law required the quarry to be subject to an EA, as soon as there was an agreement to establish a JRP, any question of the scope of the EA of the Whites Point project was rendered moot.582\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 344.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 346.\n\n406.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the, referral of the project by Minister Thibault to the Minister of the Environment for submission to a JRP was based on the advice of DFO officials who concluded, in their discretion under s. 21 of the *CEAA*, that there was likelihood of significant adverse environmental effects and significant public concern.583\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 347-348, 355.\n\n407.\n\nIt is the Respondent's position that it did not breach any transparency obligation by not notifying the Investors about the referral of the Whites Point project to a JRP, or because it led them to believe otherwise.584 As a preliminary matter, Article 1105(1) does not include a transparency obligation.585 Secondly, the Respondent argues that the Investors should have anticipated that Whites Point project could be referred to a JRP given that government regulators consistently noted the possibility.586\n\nRejoinder, para. 132.\n\nRejoinder, para. 133 (*see* relevant references of the Respondent in this para. to decisions of other tribunals that rejected the argument that Article 1105(1) includes a transparency obligation).\n\nDFO specifically informed GQP, as early as 6 January 2003, that referral to a review panel was a distinct possibility in light of the project's potential significant adverse environmental effects and the public concern that it had created. Further, in initially notifying GQP that the project would be assessed, at the very least, through a comprehensive study, DFO made expressly clear that \"although the type of assessment being used for this project is a CS [comprehensive study], *CEAA* (Section 23) includes the provision that the project could be referred to a mediator or review panel\".

The Joint Appointment of the JRP members\n--------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Investors allegations that the appointments of Drs. Fournier, Muecke and Grant to the JRP constituted a violation of Article 1105 on the grounds that they lacked \"requisite professional credentials and experience,\"587 and were \"manifestly biased.\"588 The Respondent argues that the Investors recognized the qualifications of the JRP members upon their appointment in 2004, referring to comments made in the lead-up to the constitution of the JRP stating that all three members were \"competent and are respected in their fields\".589 Furthermore, the Respondent submits that \"there is simply no basis to conclude now, and certainly none that would have led to a conclusion at the time, that Drs. Fournier, Muecke and Grant were in any way biased against Bilcon or the Whites Point project\".590\n\nMemorial, para 461.\n\nMemorial, para 462.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 359, referring to CLC Minutes, dated 24 November 2004, p. 235, Exhibit R-299.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 360; Questions for Interviewing Review Panel Candidates, Exhibit R-206; First Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, para. 41; First Affidavit of Christopher Daly, paras. 48-49.\n\niii. The Acts of the JRP Prior to the Issuance of its Report\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Investors never voiced a concern that they were prevented from adequately preparing for the hearings, or that their experts were not afforded a fair opportunity to present their evidence.591 They also never exercised their right to request additional time from the JRP.592\n\nRejoinder, para. 136.\n\nRejoinder, para. 136.\n\n410.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Investors' assertion that Bilcon did not have an opportunity to address the concept of \"community core values\" and argues that the Investors' assertion:\n\nignores completely the fact that every component of what the JRP discussed as community core values was identified in detail in the \u2018Final EIS Guidelines' which, as the title suggests, was supposed to guide Bilcon in the preparation of its evidence.593\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Investors had several opportunities to comment on or question the EIS Guidelines but did not.594\n\nSecond Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 138, cited in Rejoinder, para. 137.\n\nRejoinder, para. 137, referring also to Second Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 148.\n\niv. The Preparation of the JRP Report\n-------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nAs explained above (see paragraphs 283-295 of this Award), the Respondent argues that the actions and report of the JRP are not attributable to the Respondent. Even if these actions were attributable to it, it is the Respondent's position that the Investors have not established that the JRP's actions or report breached Article 1105(1).595\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 365. *See also* Counter-Memorial, paras. 267-297.\n\n412.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the JRP's role is to gather information to make recommendations. Therefore, in the Respondent's view, the only relevant question is whether the JRP's actions in any way deprived the Claimants of a fair process during the information gathering stage of the EA. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that \"the actions of the JRP were reasonable, fair, and at all times conformed to the applicable legislative and regulatory framework\".596\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 366; Letter from Paul Buxton to Debra Myles, dated 9 July 2007, Exhibit R-259.\n\n413.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors were given a reasonable opportunity to be heard throughout the EA process, and that the JRP conducted the hearings impartially, duly exercising its mandate. It notes that before the JRP was constituted, the Investors elected not to comment on a draft of the JRP Agreement and Terms of Reference. In addition, although the JRP sought the Investors' comments on the draft EIS Guidelines, the Investors \"chose not to speak at the scoping hearings, and submitted only brief written comments on the draft,\" according to the Respondent.597\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 368.\n\n414.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Investors' argument that the JRP should have asked them and their experts more questions, arguing that the Investors bore the burden of proving that their project would not cause significant adverse environmental effects. Finally, the Respondent denies that the JRP required \"an impossible standard of \u2018perfect certainty'\".598 The Respondent argues that, here, the problem was that the proponent failed to provide complete and deficient information.599\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 370 (citing Memorial, para. 469).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 370.\n\n415.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, nothing in the JRP report suggests that the members of the JRP were biased against the Investors or their project. The Respondent maintains that the critical comments complained of reflect nothing more than frustration with the presentations made by the Investors.\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the EIS Guidelines made clear that the JRP would be focusing on concepts like traditional knowledge, the precautionary principle, and the project's socioeconomic effects, such as the effects on community core values.600 The JRP was entitled, under the JRP Agreement, to include some of these factors as a result of public comments, and the Investors did not object to these factors at the time that they were added.601\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 375. *See also* Rejoinder para. 143.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 376.\n\n417.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"the factors that the JRP addressed in the EA were rooted in the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks of Canada and Nova Scotia\".602 Thus, the reliance on the notion of \"community core values\" was based on the JRP Agreement, which \"directed the JRP to apply not only the *CEAA* but also Part IV of the *NSEA*, which expressly requires consideration of broad socio-economic effects\".603 The Investors' expert witness, Mr. David Estrin, acknowledged that effects on \"community core values\" are socioeconomic effects.604\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 378; First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 378; JRP Agreement, Part III, Exhibit R-27.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 379; First Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 230, 243.\n\n418.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that all the Investors' arguments regarding the other factors that the JRP considered or failed to consider605 are not only wrong but also do not rise to the level of egregious conduct required for a violation of Article 1105.606 Even if any of the factors considered by the JRP were inconsistent with typical practice in Canadian law, or were outside of the Panel's mandate, that does not, in the Respondent's view, citing the *Cargill* case, amount to a breach of Article 1105.607 The Respondent notes that the Investors did not raise any claims in the domestic courts about the JRP process and even admitted contemporaneously that \"[t]he [JRP] process ran smoothly and efficiently\".608\n\nThe Respondent refers to the arguments of the Investors regarding \"(1) the consideration by the JRP of the potential cumulative environmental effects of the project, (2) the review by the JRP of the traditional knowledge of the community (not just aboriginal people), the use by the JRP of the precautionary principle, (4) the rejection by the JRP of Bilcon's overreliance on the concept of adaptive management, and (5) the consideration by the JRP of whether the project could be justified\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 381). *See also* Rejoinder, paras. 146-147, for a similar reply with regard to the Investors arguments regarding the \"precautionary principle, adaptive management, mitigation measures and an alleged (but unsubstantiated) failure to take note of evidence\".\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 381.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 227-229, rejecting the Investors' arguments concerning *Mobil, Cargill,* and *Glamis.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 383; Letter from Paul Buxton to Debra Myles, dated 9 July 2007, Exhibit R-259.\n\n419.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the JRP applied the definition of \"significant adverse environmental effects\" set out in the *Nova Scotia EA Regulations* which do not require that an adverse effect rise to the level of \"major or catastrophic\" for it to be deemed \"significant\". In the Respondent's view, as the JRP had to satisfy the requirements of both the federal and provincial regulatory frameworks, it was entirely reasonable for it to use the definition of \"significant\" that afforded the highest standard of environmental protection.609\n\nRejoinder, para. 144.\n\n420.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Investors' assertion that the JRP's conclusion with respect to community core values \"gave a veto to those opposed to the project\" and argues that the JRP effectively detailed the reasons why it concluded that the project would be inconsistent with the community's core values.610\n\nRejoinder, para. 145.\n\nv. The Ministerial Decisions following the JRP Report\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the ministerial decision to adopt the recommendation of the JRP did not breach Article 1105(1). First, the Respondent observes that, under s. 37 of the *CEAA*, it was the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, not the federal Minister of the Environment, that was required to prepare a response to the JRP report, seek the approval of the Governor-in-Council, and issue the response.611 It is the Respondent's position that the Minister came to a reasoned conclusion on the basis of the JRP's recommendations as evidenced by the careful consideration given to the submissions of the Investors.612 The Respondent notes that there is no requirement in Canadian law that Ministers must receive comments or hear views from the various stakeholders on a JRP's recommendations.613\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 362.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 363. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 150.\n\nRejoinder, para. 149. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 364.\n\nvi. Full Protection & Security\n------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"the obligation to provide full protection and security extends only to guaranteeing the physical security of investors and their investment\".614 According to the Respondent, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens \"does not extend to \u2018regulatory security' and certainly not to the type of \u2018protection' the Claimants seek\".615 Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Investors failed to provide evidence that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment includes an obligation to provide a stable legal environment for investors.616\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 384. *See also* Counter-Memorial, paras. 385-386, and Rejoinder, para. 154.\n\nRejoinder, para. 154. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 385.\n\nRejoinder, para. 154. *See also* Counter-Memorial, para. 385.\n\n423.\n\nThe Respondent submits that although the Investors' claim to have been denied a stable legal environment due to political interference, the evidence they have submitted does not substantiate such interference.617\n\nRejoinder, para. 155.\n\nvii. Legitimate Expectations\n----------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 1105(1) does not include a stand-alone obligation protecting legitimate expectations and that a breach of legitimate expectations can only be a relevant factor in considering whether a measure violated Article 1105(1).618 It is the Respondent's position that the Investors must demonstrate that they had objective expectations which arose from specific assurances made by the Respondent to induce their investment at Whites Point before they can substantiate any breach thereof.619\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 389-391; Rejoinder, para. 156.\n\nRejoinder, para. 156; Counter-Memorial, para. 392.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent argues that all the meetings with Canadian politicians and officials to which the Investors refer do not support the Investors' contention because all these meetings occurred in late 2002 and well into 2003, after the Investors had decided to invest in the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal.620\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 393. *See also* Counter-Memorial, paras. 35-41.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the assertion that the conditional approval to Nova Stone for a 3.9 ha quarry at the Whites Point project site created a legitimate expectation for the Investors that they would be permitted to develop a 152 ha quarry and a 170 m long marine terminal that would operate for 50 years.621 According to the Respondent, a conditional approval does not give rise to an objective expectation arising from a specific assurance.622\n\nRejoinder, para. 157.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 158-159.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The International Minimum Standard**\n------------------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nNAFTA Article 1105 has by now been the subject of considerable analysis and interpretation by numerous arbitral tribunals. The Tribunal in the present case is guided by these earlier cases, particularly the formulation of the international minimum standard by the *Waste Management* Tribunal.\n\n428.\n\nArticle 1105 provides:\n\nArticle 1105: Minimum Standard of Treatment\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and notwithstanding Article 1108(7)(b), each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, and to investments of investors of another Party, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife.\n\n3. Paragraph 2 does not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or grants that would be inconsistent with Article 1102 but for Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n429.\n\nAfter a number of NAFTA claims had been filed, and in light of some of the early awards that had by then be rendered, the Free Trade Commission on 31 July 2001 issued the following Notes of Interpretation:\n\n1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment of another Party;\n\n2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment;\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).623\n\nNAFTA Free Trade Commission Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, 31 July 2001, at B, Exhibit RA-49.\n\n430.\n\nArticle 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties calls on treaty interpreters to take into account \"any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\". Yet NAFTA Article 1131(2) contains a *lex specialis*, which goes further in providing that \"[a]n interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section\". Under the general rule on interpretation set out in the Vienna Convention, a NAFTA tribunal would only need to \"take into account\" the subsequent agreement.624 However, by virtue of NAFTA Article 1131(2), acts of authentic interpretation by the States parties to the Agreement, like the Notes just referred to, are binding and conclusive.\n\nHearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 179. *See also* Anthea Roberts, *Power and Persuasion in Investment Treaty Interpretation: The Dual Role of States*, 104 AM. J. INT'L L. 179, 199 (2010).\n\n431.\n\nThe disputants in the present case both agree that the FTC Notes are binding, although they disagree on their interpretation.625 Their disagreement concerns the relationship between the minimum standard of international law and the concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\", particularly the question whether the Tribunal can look at other sources of international law beyond the FTC Notes to shed light on the meaning of Article 1105.\n\nMemorial, para. 288, cited in Counter-Memorial, para. 310.\n\n432.\n\nAccording to the Investors, the FTC Notes are only one element that the Tribunal should use,626 whereas Canada took the view that the Tribunal was limited to the authentic interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard provided by the FTC.627 The Tribunal agrees with Canada on this point. In light of the FTC Notes and in the specific context of NAFTA Chapter Eleven in which this Tribunal operates, \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" cannot be regarded as \"autonomous\" treaty norms that impose additional requirements above and beyond what the minimum standard requires.628\n\nReply, para. 191.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 102-105.\n\n*See* the discussion of the additive approach in *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, 10 April 2001, paras. 110 et seq.\n\n433.\n\nNAFTA Article 1105 is, then, identical to the minimum international standard. The crucial question\u2014on which the Parties diverge\u2014is what is the content of the contemporary international minimum standard that the tribunal is bound to apply. NAFTA awards make it clear that the international minimum standard is not limited to conduct by host states that is outrageous. The contemporary minimum international standard involves a more significant measure of protection.\n\n434.\n\nMany tribunals have reviewed the historical development of the international minimum standard, so that the present Tribunal can focus on the aspects that are particularly important for the present case. The starting point is generally the *Neer* case. A United States-Mexico Claims Commission was considering not an investment complaint, but the alleged failure of Mexico to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the death of a United States citizen. The *Neer* Commission held that a breach of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens requires treatment that amounts to \"bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\".629 The NAFTA tribunal in *Glamis* considered that the *Neer* articulation is still the standard, although notions may have changed about what in the circumstances constitutes outrageous conduct.630\n\n*LFH Neer and Pauline Neer (USA) v. United Mexican States* (1926), 4 RIAA 60, pp. 61-62.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award, 8 June 2009, para. 22.\n\n435.\n\nNAFTA tribunals have, however, tended to move away from the position more recently expressed in *Glamis*, and rather move towards the view that the international minimum standard has evolved over the years towards greater protection for investors. Thus, the NAFTA tribunal in *ADF Group* in 2003 held that the customary international law referred to in Article 1105(1) is not \"frozen in time\" and that the minimum standard of treatment does evolve.631 The tribunal in *Merrill* & *Ring*, in 2010, referred to practice, decisions and commentary within both NAFTA and in the wider world and concluded that:\n\nThe trend towards liberalization of the standard applicable to the treatment of business, trade and investments continued unabated over several decades and has yet not stopped. The examination of claims brought by many governments for settlement by agreement is also illustrative of such open-minded standard, including all kinds of property, rights and interests. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has also significantly contributed to this trend.\n\nConduct which is unjust, arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory or in violation of due process has also been noted by NAFTA Tribunals as constituting a breach of fair and equitable treatment, even in the absence of bad faith or malicious intention....\n\nA requirement that aliens be treated fairly and equitably in relation to business, trade and investment is the outcome of this changing reality and as such it has become sufficiently part of widespread and consistent practice so as to demonstrate that it is reflected today in customary international law as *opinio juris*. In the end, the name assigned to the standard does not really matter. What matters is that the standard protects against all such acts or behavior that might infringe a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness. Of course, the concepts of fairness, equitableness and reasonableness cannot be defined precisely: they require to be applied to the facts of each case.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the applicable minimum standard of treatment of investors is found in customary international law and that, except for cases of safety and due process, today\u2018s minimum standard is broader than that defined in the *Neer* case and its progeny. Specifically this standard provides for the fair and equitable treatment of alien investors within the confines of reasonableness. The protection does not go beyond that required by customary law, as the FTC has emphasized. Nor, however, should protected treatment fall short of the customary law standard.632\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, para. 113.\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, ICSID Administered Case, Award, 31 March 2010, paras. 207, 208, 210 and 213 respectively; other tribunal decisions noting the evolution of the standard include *Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para. 281, *ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, para. 179, and *Mondev v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para. 116.\n\n436.\n\nIn light of the FTC Notes, it is important to emphasize that the trend in the wider world outside NAFTA is only relevant to the extent that such trend has affected the international minimum standard under customary international law. There have been different abstract formulations of the kind of conduct that constitutes a breach of the international minimum standard. Yet all authorities agree that the mere breach of domestic law or any kind of unfairness does not violate the international minimum standard.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that international responsibility and dispute resolution, in the investor context, is not supposed to be the continuation of domestic politics and litigation by other means. Modern regulatory and social welfare states tackle complex problems. Not all situations can be addressed in advance by the laws that are enacted. Room must be left for judgment to be used to interpret legal standards and apply them to the facts. Even when state officials are acting in good faith there will sometimes be not only controversial judgments, but clear-cut mistakes in following procedures, gathering and stating facts and identifying the applicable substantive rules. State authorities are faced with competing demands on their administrative resources and there can be delays or limited time, attention and expertise brought to bear in dealing with issues. The imprudent exercise of discretion or even outright mistakes do not, as a rule, lead to a breach of the international minimum standard.\n\n438.\n\nAt the same time, the international minimum standard exists and has evolved in the direction of increased investor protection precisely because sovereign states\u2014the same ones constrained by the standard\u2014have chosen to accept it. States have concluded that the standard protects their own nationals in other countries and encourages the inflow of visitors and investment.\n\n439.\n\nThree additional considerations are relevant in applying the international minimum standard. First, third-party adjudicators must, in applying the international minimum standard, take into account that domestic authorities may have more familiarity with the factual and domestic legal complexities of a situation. Secondly, domestic authorities may also enjoy distinctive kinds of legitimacy, such as being elected or accountable to elected authorities. Thirdly, the NAFTA parties have expressly chosen not only to provide a third-party dispute settlement machinery, but to make it directly accessible to investors. Third-party adjudicators may have their own advantages including independence and detachment from domestic pressures.\n\n440.\n\nIn order to strike an appropriate balance and taking into account the FTC Notes, a number of NAFTA tribunals have attempted to identify a \"threshold of seriousness\" that an alleged breach of equity, fairness or law must attain before constituting a breach of the international minimum standard. Many NAFTA tribunals have shared the emerging consensus that the *Neer* standard of indisputably outrageous misconduct is no longer applicable, but there is no consensus yet on a formulation that best suits the modern evolution of the standard. For example, the *S.D. Myers* tribunal found that the investor must have been treated in \"such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective\". It also noted that a determination of a breach \"must be made in light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders\".633\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, para. 263, cited in Counter-Memorial, para. 321.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal in the present case agrees that there is indeed a high threshold for Article 1105 to apply.634 The language of Article 1105 itself is the necessary reference point in interpreting the international minimum standard. The search is to determine whether there has been a denial of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\". According to the FTC Notes, NAFTA tribunals are bound to interpret and apply the standard in accordance with customary international law. In interpreting the international minimum standard, the Tribunal also drew guidance from earlier NAFTA Chapter Eleven decisions.\n\n*Cf.* *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award, 26 January 2006, paras. 194, 197.\n\n442.\n\nThe formulation of the \"general standard for Article 1105\" by the *Waste Management* Tribunal is particularly influential, and a number of other tribunals have applied its formulation of the international minimum standard based on its reading of NAFTA authorities:\n\nTaken together, the *S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF* and *Loewen* cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\n\nEvidently the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.635\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)00/3, 30 April 2004, paras. 98 and 99, quoted in *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. & Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/04, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, para. 141, and in *Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para. 282.\n\n443.\n\nWhile no single arbitral formulation can definitively and exhaustively capture the meaning of Article 1105, the Tribunal finds this quote from *Waste Management* to be a particularly apt one. Acts or omissions constituting a breach must be of a serious nature. The *Waste Management* formulation applies intensifying adjectives to certain items\u2014but by no means all of them\u2014in its list of categories of potentially nonconforming conduct. The formulation includes \"grossly\" unfair, \"manifest\" failure of natural justice and \"complete\" lack of transparency.\n\n444.\n\nThe list conveys that there is a high threshold for the conduct of a host state to rise to the level of a NAFTA Article 1105 breach, but that there is no requirement in all cases that the challenged conduct reaches the level of shocking or outrageous behaviour. The formulation also recognises the requirement for tribunals to be sensitive to the facts of each case, the potential relevance of reasonably relied-on representations by a host state, and a recognition that injustice in either procedures or outcomes can constitute a breach.\n\n445.\n\nOn the facts, the *Waste Management* tribunal concluded that Mexico had not breached Article 1105. In setting out its persuasive test for breach of the international minimum standard, the tribunal noted *obiter* that the breach of reasonably relied-on expectations could be a relevant factor\u2014but concluded that no such representations had been made by the Mexican authorities. The tribunal's qualifier that the investor needs to have \"reasonably relied\" on the representations is important. The *Glamis* tribunal refers to \"objective expectations *in order to* *induce* investment and the subsequent repudiation of those expectations\".636 The *ADF* tribunal suggests that only representations made by authorized officials qualify for consideration in this context.637\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award, 8 June 2009, para. 22 (emphasis in original).\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, para. 189.\n\n446.\n\nIn the reasons that follow, the Tribunal will review the various aspects of the Investors' claim that there has been a breach of the international minimum standard. Even though the Tribunal by no means sustained all of these contentions, it finds that Canada breached Article 1105. This finding rests on the following factual and legal determinations.\n\n447.\n\nFirst, the Investors understood that they would only obtain environmental permission if the project satisfied the requirements of the laws of federal Canada and Nova Scotia. They expected, however, that absent any change in the federal or provincial law, the project site was not effectively zoned against development, and that their project would be assessed on the merits of its environmental soundness in accordance with the same legal standards applied to applicants generally.\n\n448.\n\nSecondly, the Investors reasonably relied on specific encouragements, at the political and technical level, to pursue the project not only in Nova Scotia but in the specific site they chose.\n\n449.\n\nThirdly, these encouragements contributed to the Investors' decision to not only proceed with their business plans, but to invest very substantive corporate resources\u2014including several millions of dollars\u2014in good faith to obtain and present an Environmental Impact Statement.\n\n450.\n\nFourthly, the JRP, by its own acknowledgment, adopted an unprecedented approach. This approach was inimical to the proponents having any real chance of success based on an assessment of their individual project on its merits in accordance with the laws in force at the time.\n\n451.\n\nFifthly, this \"community core values\" approach of the JRP was open to at least four possible interpretations. On any plausible interpretation, it was highly problematic in light of the applicable law and facts of the case. The Investors were given no reasonable notice that the JRP was going to adopt this unique approach and therefore had no opportunity to seek to clarify or contest it.\n\n452.\n\nSixthly, the \"community core values\" approach of the JRP was the decisive and overriding consideration. The JRP did not carry out its mandate to conduct a \"likely significant effects after mitigation\" analysis to the whole range of potential project effects, as required by the *CEAA*. The JRP thus arrived at its conclusions under both the laws of federal Canada and Nova Scotia without having fully discharged a crucial dimension of its mandated task. The ultimate decision makers in the governments of federal Canada and Nova Scotia were not provided with all the information that could have provided a proper foundation from which to arrive at their own final conclusions.\n\n453.\n\nIn the result, the Investors were encouraged to engage in a regulatory approval process costing millions of dollars and other corporate resources that was in retrospect unwinnable from the outset, even though the Investors were specifically encouraged by government officials and the laws of federal Canada to believe that they could succeed on the basis of the individual merits of their case.\n\n454.\n\nThe approach by the JRP that constitutes a breach of Article 1105 is not merely a matter of disputed judgments interpreting grey areas of the law, weighing contested points of evidence, or exercising scientific judgment. In the end the JRP's decision was effectively to impose a moratorium on projects of the category involved here\u2014a kind of zoning decision.\n\n**(b) The Encouragement of the Investment and Ensuing Expectations of the Investors**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nThe reasonable expectations of the investor are a factor to be taken into account in assessing whether the host state breached the international minimum standard of fair treatment under Article 1105 of NAFTA. In this context, the Tribunal will review what the Investors could reasonably expect in their interactions with officials of federal Canada and Nova Scotia and the legal and policy framework that existed at the time, in light of the general and specific encouragements Bilcon received to invest in a coastal quarry and marine terminal project in the Digby Neck area.\n\n456.\n\nThe official public policy of Nova Scotia has been to welcome investment in mining. This official welcome has extended to foreign investors, to tidewater developments (projects on or near the coastline taking advantage of Nova Scotia's access to markets through ocean transport) and to the extraction of aggregate for construction purposes.\n\n457.\n\nIn 1996, the Government of Nova Scotia issued its policy statement \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\". It extols the benefits that mineral exploration and production can bring to the Nova Scotia economy, including jobs and tax revenues.638 The business environment should be \"competitive at national and international levels, and supported by clear, fair and effective policies and regulations and promotion of the province's mineral potential\".639 It also notes that the strategic direction of Nova Scotia policy will lead to greater economic opportunities and higher levels of investment.640 The statement specifically acknowledges that Nova Scotia's mining history includes \"building stone, sand and gravel, and crushed rock\".641\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, pp. 4-5.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, p. 11.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, p. 3.\n\n458.\n\nThe Nova Scotia policy recognizes the need to \"ensure protection of the environment\".642 It calls for \"flexible planning strategies that accommodate many different resources and conservation interests. Rational choices between multiple resource and conservation uses should be made within an integrated decision-making system, which includes high-quality data on mineral resources\".643 There should be a \"one-window\" approach to regulatory requirements, consultation and assistance.644 The provincial government \"will promote the province's mineral resource potential at the community level and encourage municipalities and local economic development groups to consider exploration and mining as positive components in local economic development. The mining industry will be encouraged to identify and consider local concerns through consultation during the planning and development stages of mining projects\".645 The province will \"foster more cooperative working arrangements\"646 among stakeholders.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, p. 12.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, p. 11.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, p. 16.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, pp. 16-17.\n\nNSDNR, \"Minerals\u2014A Policy for Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, dated 1996, Exhibit 5 to Witness Statement of John Lizak, p. 16.\n\n459.\n\nAnother official provincial publication specifically dealt with marine quarries. It stated that:\n\nNova Scotia is very well situated on great circle shipping routes to Europe....and on established shipping routes to the United States Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast. Consumption of aggregates is increasing in the United States and this trend is to continue.647\n\n\"Potential Crushed Stone Deposits on Tidewater in Nova Scotia\", Gordon Dickie, Nova Scotia Department of Mines and Energy, dated November 1987, p. 1, Exhibit 3 to Witness Statement of John Lizak.\n\n460.\n\nAn accompanying map shows outward arrows from Nova Scotia to New York,648 among other locations. Another map, designating \"locations of potential crushed stone deposits in Nova Scotia\",649 indicates the kind of rock to be found in various parts of the province. The Digby Neck area is marked as \"sedimentary and minor volcanic rocks\".\n\n\"Potential Crushed Stone Deposits on Tidewater in Nova Scotia\", Gordon Dickie, Nova Scotia Department of Mines and Energy, dated November 1987, p. 2, Figure 1, Exhibit 3 to Witness Statement of John Lizak.\n\n\"Potential Crushed Stone Deposits on Tidewater in Nova Scotia\", Gordon Dickie, Nova Scotia Department of Mines and Energy, dated November 1987, p. 3, Figure 2, Exhibit 3 to Witness Statement of John Lizak.\n\n461.\n\nMr. Lizak, a geological expert retained by the Clayton Group in 2002, recalls that Nova Scotia officials specifically referred him to a document entitled \"Industrial Minerals in Nova Scotia\". It contains quotes such as the following:\n\nNova Scotia has a rich history in industrial mineral production spanning a period of over 200 years. From the earliest extraction of aggregate for local road construction the industry has developed into a supplier of numerous industrial commodities for local, interprovincial and international markets.\n\nIn addition, over 75 aggregate producers process mineral aggregate at numerous pits and quarries throughout the province.\n\n...[the mining] industry has also enjoyed the support and experience of several government agencies and the numerous excellent research facilities which are found here. The people and the Government of Nova Scotia are committed to the continued growth and development of industrial mineral production in our Province, ensuring a long and prosperous future for this vital industry.\n\nThe geology of Nova *Scotia offers excellent potential for the production of quality aggregate materials....Some of the deposits are in proximity to tidewater, opening the possibility of new marine quarry opportunities*.650\n\n\"Industrial Minerals in Nova Scotia\", Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, undated, pp. 10-11, Exhibit 4 to Witness Statement of John Lizak (emphasis added).\n\n462.\n\nMr. Lizak testified that between 2002 and 2005 he had at least ten meetings with provincial natural resources officials discussing the availability of quarrying sites. Provincial officials even took him on a helicopter tour of potential aggregate sites, although they did not specifically include Whites Point. Mr. Lizak conveyed to the Investors the following message resulting from his review of government documents and meetings: that Nova Scotia was encouraging investors to establish marine quarries, supported mining for export markets, and had an efficient \"one window\" environmental assessment process.651\n\nWitness Statement of John Lizak, p. 290.\n\n463.\n\nWhile Nova Scotia technical officials do not appear to have specifically promoted Whites Point among possible locations, once it was identified by the private developers, technical experts at Nova Scotia were highly supportive:\n\n... when they became familiar with the project...there was tremendous encouragement. They wanted this to go.652\n\nTestimony of John Lizak, Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 289, lines 15-17.\n\n464.\n\nMr. Daniel Kontak, a Regional Geologist at the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, met with Mr. Lizak and provided encouragement and technical information:\n\n[Mr. Daniel Kontak] visited the [Whites Point] site with me several times, overnighted on the site, provided countless publications. He sampled our core. He analyzed our core. He also reviewed, you know, documents that we prepared for the Whites Point quarry. It was a very collaborative process. I mean, I didn't ask for this help. You know, had I essentially had to pay for this, it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars.653\n\nTestimony of John Lizak, Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 290, lines 5-17.\n\n465.\n\nMr. William Clayton, a shareholder and senior executive with the Clayton Group of Companies, testified that Bilcon had been obtaining some of its crushed stone from a quarry in New Brunswick. The quarry was located on a tributary of the Bay of Fundy. It only partially met the company's need for crushed stone. The Clayton Group discovered, through research that the investment climate in Nova Scotia was \"very encouraging to companies seeking to quarry in Nova Scotia\".654 \"In light of Nova Scotia's favourable stance\", the Clayton Group decided to seek approval of a quarry near Whites Point Cove.655 In 2002, the Group formed a partnership with Nova Stone to develop the project and in April 2004 took over as sole proprietor.\n\nWitness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 6.\n\nWitness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 9.\n\n466.\n\nMr. Paul Buxton headed the approval process for the Group. He met with the Honourable Gordon Balser, the Nova Scotia Minister for Natural Resources and the member of the legislature for the Whites Point quarry area. Mr. Buxton reported to the Clayton Group that Minister Balser encouraged the project and \"kept discussing the need for new jobs in the area\".656 Mr. Clayton concluded that:\n\nBased on these meetings between Paul Buxton and Minister Balser, I became convinced that the Government of Nova Scotia looked on our Whites Point Quarry project favorably and would allow the project to be assessed in a fair, impartial and transparent way. In sum, I became convinced that Nova Scotia was a good place to do business.657\n\nWitness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 13.\n\nWitness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 13.\n\n467.\n\nMr. Clayton first became concerned about whether the environmental assessment of the project would be proceeding fairly around the spring of 2003. A Nova Scotia election was scheduled for August. \"The Whites Point Quarry project, as a result of this political tension, had become a political lightning rod in the election.\"658 Among other things, the Clayton Group had to learn through the media, rather than being informed directly, that the project would be referred to a JRP.659 Opponents of the project, on the other hand, had become informed of the referral even before the official announcement.660 Mr. Clayton wrote to the Nova Scotia Minister of the Department of Environment and Labour that \"[w]e would also like to assure you that we fully intend to comply with your regulations, your process and your laws. Our only expectation is that we will receive fair and equal consideration in return.\"661\n\nWitness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 23.\n\nWitness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 27.\n\nMemorial, para. 141, referring to Journal Note by Thomas Wheaton, dated 26 June 2003, Exhibit C-254.\n\nLetter from Mr. William Richard Clayton to Minister Morash, dated 24 October 2003, Exhibit 9 to Witness Statement of Mr. William Richard Clayton, para. 16.\n\n468.\n\nMr. Paul Buxton testified that in 2002 and 2003, the Province of Nova Scotia was engaged in a prominent advertising campaign proclaiming that \"Nova Scotia was Open for Business\". This campaign continued throughout the environmental assessment process for Whites Point.662 The Nova Scotia Minister for Natural Resources made available related publications to the public and to Mr. Buxton. Mr. Balser was \"very keen to have new jobs in his constituency\".663 Through 2002, Mr. Buxton \"had at least fifteen meetings and discussions with Mr. Balser, who always encouraged the Claytons' investment in the region, and kept reinforcing the positive impact the Whites Point Quarry would have on job creation and related investment in the area\".664 Mr. Balser's encouragement specifically extended to a project at the Whites Point area, rather than being of a more general nature:\n\nOn June 24, 2002, Bill Clayton Sr., Bill Clayton Jr., John Wall, and myself, attended a meeting with Minister Balser at his office. At that meeting, Minister Balser personally invited the Claytons to invest in a quarry at Whites Point.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Minister Balser, Bilcon received a letter from Minister Balser's office thanking the Claytons for meeting with him. Minister Balser's letter also said: I hope that you and your company will continue to move the project forward as I feel it has the potential to benefit both you and our area. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of any assistance.665\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 17.\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 17.\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 19.\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, paras. 22-23.\n\n469.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Premier himself, Mr. Rodney MacDonald, personally told the Claytons that the Province was \"open for business\". \"Like Minister Balser, the Premier was supportive of the quarry investment the Claytons were considering making in Nova Scotia.\"666\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 18.\n\n470.\n\nThe partnership documents between Nova Stone and Bilcon suggest, and Mr. Clayton confirmed in cross-examination, that it was Bilcon's initial plan that Nova Stone would bring to the partnership all necessary permits.667 When it emerged that Nova Stone did not have them, however, Bilcon continued with the project including spending years and millions of dollars on attempting to obtain approvals under federal Canada's and Nova Scotia's environmental protection regimes. A series of encouragements by Nova Scotia in policy pronouncements and directly by elected officials and civil servants, some highlights of which the Tribunal has quoted, created the expectation in the Investors, on which they could reasonably rely, that an environmental impact assessment of a coastal quarry and marine terminal project in the Whites Point area would be carried out fairly and impartially within the legislative framework provided by federal Canada and Nova Scotia. The specific encouragements were critical for the Investors' decision to continue with the project, including the commitment of significant resources to the environmental assessment process.\n\nTestimony of William Richard Clayton, Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, pp. 201 et seq.\n\n471.\n\nIn the process leading up to the referral to the JRP, the conduct of Canada's officials reinforced the Investors' belief that regulators' concerns could be addressed through a process whereby potential negative impacts would be identified in a rational and evidence-based manner and the Investors would be invited to find ways to prevent or mitigate such impacts by appropriate adjustments to project design and operation. With respect to the operation of a 3.9 ha quarry, regulators raised questions about impacts from blasting on marine mammals and fish, and the exchanges focused on official regulations and policies and the science of the extent of impacts and how they could be avoided.\n\n472.\n\nIn the letter from Minister Thibault to the Minister of the Environment requesting a referral to a JRP, Minister Thibault notes potential environmental impacts668 as well as the desirability of harmonizing the federal review with the Nova Scotia environmental assessment process. Under the *CEAA*, a responsible authority could request a Review Panel on two possible bases: that a project may cause significant adverse environmental effects after mitigation, or public concern. The referral letter mentions only the former, environmental impact.\n\nLetter from Robert Thibault, Minister to David Anderson, dated 26 June 2003, Exhibit C-466.\n\n473.\n\nMr. Clayton sought an explanation of the referral from federal officials. An official told him: \"You're in a Panel Review and we're not going to tell you why\".669 Mr. Clayton was rebuffed in his attempts to obtain a copy of the letter from Minister Thibault mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but it was finally revealed to him much later, by the JRP.670\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 54.\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 56.\n\n474.\n\nThe \"reasonable expectations\" analysis must take into account the regulatory framework for environmental assessments of the time and the direction provided by the JRP pursuant to its statutory mandate.\n\n475.\n\nThe *CEAA* sets out the law on environmental assessments. It includes: an overall set of objectives; a sequence of steps to be followed; an allocation of varying roles for project proponents, interveners, members of the public and regulators; a list of factors that must be considered in each and every environmental assessment, and finally a set of definitions.\n\n476.\n\nThe Act promotes the reconciliation, through assessment and planning, of economic development and protection of the environment. Its application is triggered by the involvement in projects of \"responsible authorities\"\u2014federal authorities that have a role in proposing a project, providing it with financial support or the use or transfer of federal government property or issues a permit or license.671 An environmental assessment should be carried out \"as early as practicable in the planning stages of the project and before irrevocable decisions are made\".672 The purpose of the Act is to ensure \"careful consideration\" of the environmental effects of projects before responsible authorities take actions in connection with them.673 Such actions should \"promote sustainable development and thereby achieve or maintain a healthy environment and a healthy economy\".\n\n*CEAA*, s. 5.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 11.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 4(1)(a).\n\n477.\n\nEnvironmental assessments can be carried out through various means that range, in the level of public involvement among other things, from a screening, over a comprehensive study to a panel review. Whatever mechanism is used\u2014screening, comprehensive study, panel review \u2014 \"there shall be\", according to s. 16 of the *CEAA*, a consideration of factors that include:\n\n\u2022 The environmental effects of the project. \"Environment\" means the \"components of the Earth\".674 An \"environmental effect\" means a change that the project may cause in the environment. There must therefore be a physical or biological pathway that connects a project with its impacts. To the extent that a project has social or economic impacts that are not caused by a biological or physical change, they are not considered environmental effects. If, however, the pathway exists, effects to be considered include \"health and socio-economic conditions, physical and cultural heritage, current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by aboriginal persons, or any structure, site or thing that is of historical, archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance\".675\n\n\u2022 Whether the effects are adverse: if there is a biological or physical effect in comparison to normal - \"baseline\" - conditions; then it must be assessed whether these will have a negative effect from a human perspective. The *CEAA* refers to impacts on \"health and socioeconomic conditions\" and \"physical and cultural heritage\". The Reference Guide on determining likely significant adverse effects by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency of 1994 interprets the *CEAA* as permitting the assessment of human impacts on factors that include health, \"wellbeing and quality of life\" and \"aesthetics\".676\n\n\u2022 The \"significance\" of these adverse effects: significance is not defined by the Act itself. An expert report submitted by Canada677 notes that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Reference Guide provides some guidance. This document is primarily directed to advising responsible authorities and the Minister of the Environment. Significance, it explains, can be evaluated by taking into account the magnitude (severity of the effect), geographic extent, duration and frequency, reversibility and ecological context (is the area pristine or ecologically sensitive?). Official standards established by federal, provincial or municipal authorities can sometimes be used in arriving at a determination of significance; for example, the emission of a chemical into the air might be within the standard of tolerance permitted by a legislated standard, and that might contribute to a determination that the effect is not significant.678\n\n\u2022 The likelihood of significant adverse effects: the probability of effects should be predicted along with information about the degree of the scientific uncertainty that is connected with the prediction. \"There will always be some scientific uncertainty associated with the information and methods used in EAs.\"679 Where numerical methods to make predictions and define uncertainty cannot be used, the assessment must be made by a responsible authority or the Minister using \"best professional judgment\".\n\n\u2022 Measures to mitigate significant adverse effects: an environmental assessment must include a consideration of \"measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would mitigate any significant adverse environmental effects of the project\".680 Mitigation measures can be restorative or compensatory as well as preventative. They consist of \"the elimination, reduction or control of the adverse environmental effects of a project, and include restitution for any damage to the environment caused by such effects through replacement, restoration, compensation or any other means\".\n\n*CEAA,* s. 2.\n\nAll definitions quoted are from the *CEAA*, s. 2.\n\nCanadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Reference Guide: Determining Whether A Project is Likely to Cause Significant Adverse Environmental Effects, dated November 1994, p. 187, Exhibit R-20; *see also* discussion in Expert Report Expert Report of Robert Connelly, para. 70.\n\nExpert Report of Robert Connelly, para. 77; Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Reference Guide: Determining Whether A Project is Likely to Cause Significant Adverse Environmental Effects, dated November 1994, Table 1, p. 189, Exhibit R-20.\n\nCanadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Reference Guide: Determining Whether A Project is Likely to Cause Significant Adverse Environmental Effects, dated November 1994, p. 191, Exhibit R-20.\n\nCanadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Reference Guide: Determining Whether A Project is Likely to Cause Significant Adverse Environmental Effects, dated November 1994, p. 193, Exhibit R-20.\n\n*CEAA*, s. 16(1)(d).\n\n478.\n\nThe specific and fair-minded consideration of the issues just listed is clearly required in any environmental assessment conducted under the *CEAA*, including JRPs. The task of assessing the existence of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation cannot, under federal law, be obviated by wider considerations of the public interest that might weigh for or against the project. The lawfully required task of a JRP is to gather information, including public input, and to evaluate it in light of the core s. 16 question of whether there are \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation?\" The Review Panel may be assigned additional tasks under s. 16(2), but they do not appear to include a mandate to consider whether \"all the circumstances\" warrant proceeding in the face of a project that does not pass muster under the irreducible s. 16 question. Even if the s. 16(2) mandate is construed in such a broad manner, it would not relieve the JRP of its duty to carry out the rest of its core s. 16(1) tasks.\n\n479.\n\nUnder the scheme of the *CEAA*, the responsible authority makes the decision of whether the public interest, in the circumstances, outweighs the existence of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation. The responsible authority exercises its own discretion. It may authorize the project to proceed taking into account mitigation measures that the responsible authority considers appropriate.681 It may add to or delete mitigation measures recommended by the JRP. If after such mitigation there are still likely significant adverse effects, the responsible authority may authorize the project to proceed on the basis that the project is justified in all the circumstances.682\n\n*CEAA*, s. 37(1)(a).\n\n*CEAA*, s. 37(1)(a)(ii).\n\n480.\n\nBilcon could reasonably expect that a JRP whose mandate included s. 16 of the *CEAA* would methodically review the potential impacts in light of the core s. 16 question, including consideration of mitigation measures. The JRP was required to provide a thorough report that would enable responsible authorities\u2014who are the ultimate decision-makers, not the JRP\u2014to make a final determination of whether the project should proceed in all the circumstances, even in the presence of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation.\n\n481.\n\nThe expectation of a thorough assessment of the impacts of the project in light of the \"likely significant effects after mitigation\" standard is reinforced in the case of a JRP by the fact that it necessarily involves public input. A reasonably complete and judicious assessment not only informs the ultimate decision maker, but helps to legitimize whatever decision it makes by ensuring that public comment is recognized and acknowledged.683 To the extent that the reputation, and not only the ultimate authorization, of a project and its proponent are at stake, proponents could reasonably expect that a JRP process and report would be balanced in its treatment of the s. 16 question. A report would be reasonably thorough in identifying and characterizing both the risks of a proposed project, including likelihood and significance of adverse effects, and any mitigation measures proposed by the proponent, interveners or the panel itself. Otherwise, the public may be left with an untrue or exaggerated impression that the proponent has been advancing a project in a manner that is insensitive to its environmental impact.\n\n\"A secondary, related purpose [of a review panel] is to legitimize government decisions about proposals. Opponents of a project that gets approved\u2014and supporters of a project that gets rejected\u2014are more likely to accept the outcome if they have been given a chance to have their say\"; Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 193.\n\n482.\n\nIn the present case, the Agreement between federal Canada and Nova Scotia provided, in accordance with s. 41 of the *CEAA*, that:\n\n*The Report shall include recommendations on all factors set out in section 16 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act* and, pursuant to Part IV of the Nova Scotia *Environment Act*, recommend either the approval, including mitigation measures, or rejection of the Project.684\n\nAgreement concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project between the Minister of the Environment, Canada and the Minister of Environment and Labour, Nova Scotia, para. 6.3, Exhibit R-27 (emphasis added).\n\n483.\n\nThe Agreement refers to the establishment of a JRP pursuant to paragraph 40(2)(a) of the *CEAA*. The JRP was therefore obliged by the Agreement as well as by federal statute, to carry out the essential mandate of any JRP under federal law as well as carrying out the mandate of a JRP under Nova Scotia law. The dual mandate did not detract from the necessity to fulfill each individual mandate. As Canada states in its Counter-Memorial:\n\nBut while two processes can be harmonized, the criteria ultimately applied, and the decisions ultimately made, remain the unique domain of each involved government, based on their own respective legislation.685\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 44.\n\n484.\n\nPart III of the Agreement addresses the scope of the environmental assessment and factors to be considered. It includes all the additional factors listed in s. 16(2) of the *CEAA*, including purpose of the project, need for the project, alternative means of carrying it out that are technically and economically feasible, and the environmental effects of any such alternative means. With respect to the core s. 16(1) mandate, the Agreement recapitulates that the assessment must include:\n\nh) the environmental effects of the Project, including the environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the Project and any cumulative environment effects that are likely to result from the Project in combination with other projects or activities that have been or will be carried out....\n\nm) measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would mitigate any significant adverse environmental effects of the Project..\n\np) residual adverse effects and their significance.686\n\nAgreement concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project between the Minister of the Environment, Canada and the Minister of Environment and Labour, Nova Scotia, p. 9, Exhibit R-27.\n\n485.\n\nThe JRP also had a mandate to carry out the functions of a Board under the *NSEA*, the Nova Scotia counterpart of the *CEAA*. The objectives of the provincial statute in many ways match those of the federal act. The provincial statute embodies the principle of \"sustainable development\". It affirms \"the linkage between economic and environmental issues, recognizing that long-term economic prosperity depends upon sound environmental management and that effective environmental protection depends on a strong economy\".687 The goal of reconciling environmental protection and economic development is further embodied in the statute by the statement of \"the principle of shared responsibility of all Nova Scotians to sustain the environment and the economy, both locally and globally, through individual and government actions\".688 The statute commits to the objective of providing \"a responsive, effective, fair, timely and efficient administrative and regulatory system\",689 recognizing that it is \"essential to promote the purposes of this Act through non-regulatory measures such as cooperation, communication, education, incentives and partnerships, instead of punitive measures\".690 It further affirms the goal of \"providing access to information and facilitating effective public participation in the formulation of decisions affecting the environment\".691\n\n*NSEA*, s. 2(b)(vi).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 2(b)(iv).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 2(i).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 2(i).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 2(h).\n\n486.\n\nThe provincial statute, like the federal act, sets out options for environmental screening and assessment. A project might be rejected on a review by the Minister because \"of the likelihood that it will cause adverse effects or environmental effects that cannot be mitigated\".692 The Minister has the option in some cases of referring a project to a Board. The latter must conduct a public hearing or review.693 The Board submits a report to the Minister to approve the undertaking, reject it, or approve it with conditions. The Minister may then approve the undertaking, reject it, or approve it with conditions that the Minister deems appropriate. The final decision, as with a federal review panel, is left with a senior politically accountable official, not the Board. The Nova Scotia statute, like the federal Canada statute, permits agreements whereby an assessment can be conducted jointly with another jurisdiction.694\n\n*NSEA*, s. 34(1)(f).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 39.\n\n*NSEA*, s. 47.\n\n487.\n\nThere are several differences between federal Canada and Nova Scotia statutes. Under the federal Canada statute, there must be a biological or physical pathway to an impact before it can be assessed. Under the Nova Scotia statue, the environmental effects that must be assessed in the context of Part IV of the Act include \"any change, whether negative or positive, that the undertaking may cause in the environment, *including any effect on socio-economic conditions, on environmental health, physical and cultural heritage* or on any structure, site or thing including those of historical, archeological, paleontological or architectural significance\".695 Under the federal Canada statute, the mandate of a Review Panel is to assess \"adverse effects\"; while under the Nova Scotia statute, positive effects must be assessed as well. Under the federal Canada statute, a Review Panel is not called upon to recommend for or against proceeding with the project; while under the Nova Scotia statute, the Board must recommend approval, rejection or approval with conditions.696 Under the federal Canada statute, the core s. 16(1) question\u2014of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\u2014is explicitly applicable to all forms of environmental assessment, including Review Panels, whereas this specific test is not expressly made applicable in the case of a Board review under the Nova Scotia statute.\n\n*NSEA*, s. 3(v)(i) (emphasis added).\n\n*NSEA*, s. 39(1).\n\n**(c) The JRP Process and Governmental Reactions to It**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. Commencement of the JRP Process and Selection of the JRP's Members\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted the decisions of federal Canada to: (1) define the scope of the project for federal Canada purposes as including both the quarry and the marine terminal; and (2) adopt the Review Panel mode of assessment.\n\n489.\n\nThese were distinct administrative decisions made in relation to this particular Investor and investment, and completed prior to the three-year period preceding the referral of the case to international arbitration pursuant to Chapter Eleven. These decisions could have been referred to a NAFTA Panel under Chapter Eleven at the time they were made. The question then arises whether in the present proceedings the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the issues of scope and level of assessment in respect of the continuation of the process (such as the JRP proceedings) after 17 June 2005.\n\n490.\n\nThe JRP was appointed on 24 November 2004. On 15 December 2004, the JRP wrote to Bilcon to request that it review the draft EIS Guidelines and provide comments. On 16 January 2005, Bilcon did so.697 It did not initially bring to the attention of the JRP any concerns about the scope or level of assessment at the commencement of the process. Bilcon in fact did not raise these issues at any time before the JRP or to federal Canada or Nova Scotia when they were considering the JRP Report. In these circumstances, the Tribunal takes the view that it would not be consistent with the letter and object of the timeliness provisions in Chapter Eleven to hold that the scope and level of assessment were issues that had a distinct life within the postreferral stages of this case. The eligible time to bring a claim in respect of scope and level of assessment was within three years of the referral itself. In the Tribunal's opinion, therefore, there are no issues concerning scope and level of assessment that have been brought on a timely basis.\n\nThese dates are taken from the timeline provided in Canada's chronology, Counter-Memorial, pp. xi-xvi.\n\n491.\n\nMr. Estrin, an expert retained by the Investors, testified that governments should have chosen panel members who were experienced in the assessment of industrial facilities, rather than the environment generally. He also states that:\n\nTo the extent governments appointed two panel members (Robert Fournier and Gunter Muecke) who had some previous involvement with a key Nova Scotia environmental advocacy group, the Ecology Action Centre, and also appointed a third panel member (Jill Grant) who had developed arguments for greater community participation in decisionmaking as part of her academic expertise, it was reasonably foreseeable that governments were expecting the Bilcon application would be evaluated with particular empathy to a position advocated by the Ecology Action Centre and/or a position advocating community control regarding new development.698\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 516.\n\n492.\n\nMr. Estrin observes that the Ecology Action Centre in fact did oppose the Bilcon project on the basis that it was inconsistent with \"community core values\", and the Panel in fact adopted this view. He testified that he had heard it said that Dr. Fournier might have been especially sensitive to the views of the Ecology Action Centre in the Whites Point context because the same group had been critical of the position of a JRP panel in an earlier case, Sable Gas, and in fact had urged on the first day of the hearings in that case that the Panel be disbanded because of alleged bias of several members apart from Dr. Fournier.\n\n493.\n\nAccording to Mr. Estrin's second expert report, the Chair of the Panel in the present case, Dr. Fournier, had also chaired the Sable Gas Panel, which addressed \"community core values\" in the following way:\n\nFor the Sable Gas panel (which was chaired by Robert Fournier, who also chaired the WPQ JRP), it was not enough for members of the community to voice their disapproval of the project; rather, the panel insisted on evidence of an adverse impact on the community:\n\nThe Panel appreciates the high value that rural residents place on their lifestyle, and the fear that the pipeline could undermine this lifestyle. However, the Panel is not convinced that a properly designed, constructed and maintained pipeline would have the significant adverse effects that some intervenors fear.699\n\nThe Sable Gas panel seems to be saying to the community that mere NIMBY-ism (\"not in my backyard\") is not a relevant consideration. Rather, what matters is whether the evidence indicates that there are likely to be significant adverse effects on the rural way of life. Some local residents may have fears about \"safety, adverse wildlife impacts, intrusions by outsiders, and the physical appearance of the right-of-way\"\u2014but those fears are not in themselves enough to ground the rejection of the project. The panel quite properly scrutinized those fears and measured them against the evidence about likely effects, and also took into account the proposed mitigation measures as well as the available rights of recourse if any of those fears were to result in actual damage.700\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 208 (emphasis in the original).\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 209.\n\n494.\n\nMr. Buxton stated at a community liaison meeting in 2004 that the Investors, if asked, might have suggested the same individuals.701 In his testimony at the hearing, Mr. Buxton explained that:\n\n... we had looked into the Sable Gas project, which [Mr. Fournier] chaired, and had spoken to one of our consultants, Mr. Fader, who was with Natural Resources Canada until he retired. And he had, I think, a fair amount to do with the Sable project and assured us that if Mr. Fournier was chair of the panel, that he would insist on decisions being made on a scientific basis. And that's basically what we wanted to hear.702\n\nSecond Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 216.\n\nCross-examination of Paul Buxton, Hearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 376.\n\n495.\n\nAs the Tribunal already noted, Mr. Estrin testified that he had \"heard it said\" that critical responses to Dr. Fournier's involvement in the Sable Gas matter might actually have influenced Dr. Fournier to adopt a less balanced approach in the Whites Point matter. Mr. Estrin was clear, however, that he could not confirm as a matter of his own judgment that there was a link between the Ecology Action Centre's criticisms of the Panel in the Sable matter and Dr. Fournier's later approach concerning Bilcon.703\n\nCross-examination of David Estrin, Hearing Transcript, 24 October 2013, p. 215.\n\n496.\n\nThe testimony of Mr. Estrin concerning earlier organizational connections and experiences of some of the Panel members appears to have a very limited purpose: to provide a possible explanatory context for the approach that the JRP eventually adopted. Mr. Estrin himself acknowledged that prior participation in an advocacy group does not necessarily disqualify an individual from serving on an administrative panel704 The Tribunal concludes that the evidence does not demonstrate that Canada's choice of Panel members was improper under either domestic or international standards.\n\nCross-examination of David Estrin, Hearing Transcript, 24 October 2013, p. 210.\n\nii. The JRP's Environmental Assessment Guidelines\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe federal Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement concerning the JRP provided that the CEA Agency would prepare draft guidelines for the scope of the EIS that the Investors would have to submit. The Panel would then conduct scoping meetings in locations in the project vicinity, take into account comments from the public and other stakeholders, and issue the final guidelines.705 The Panel proceeded to carry out these steps, but replaced the draft guidelines with a much lengthier set of its own, which included more extensive language on many matters, including \"social and cultural patterns\". Thus, the Investors were instructed to address:\n\n10.3.8 Social and Cultural Patterns\n\nDescribe and evaluate the potential impacts of the Project on social and cultural patterns and social organization. Consider effects on traditional lifestyles, values and culture. Consider any effects on patterns of family and community life (such as household and community organization, including the organization of work).\n\nConsider implications of the Project on residents' perceptions of quality of life and sense of place. Describe and evaluate potential impacts on social relations between residents, among generations, and between seasonal and full-time residents, among those who are employed and unemployed, and among those who support and oppose the Project.\n\nDescribe and evaluate how Project-related impacts on harvested resources or economic activities such as tourism may affect social and cultural patterns.706\n\nAgreement concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, between The Minister of the Environment, Canada, and The Minister of Environment of Labour, Nova Scotia, dated 3 November 2004, Part II, arts. 2-3, Exhibit R-27.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement Guidelines, for the review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, Joint Review Panel, dated March 2005, s. 10.3.8, p. 49, Exhibit R-210.\n\n498.\n\nIn his expert report, Mr. Estrin suggests that it was highly unusual for a Panel to be authorized to revise the guidelines issued by government agencies. Indeed, the Whites Point Quarry appears to be the only example where this was allowed after 1998.707 Mr. Estrin states that the revisions by the Panel resulted in a document that was excessively lengthy, detailed and onerous.708 Mr. Smith's Expert Report notes, however, that it was not unprecedented to have a Panel revise and finalize guidelines, and that such a process of revision was contemplated by the procedures governing the Whites Point assessment.709\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 350.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 347.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 252, citing Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Procedures for an Assessment by a Review Panel, A Guideline issued by the Honourable Christine Stewart, dated November 1997, sections 4.8.3, 4.8.4 and 4.8.5 at pp. 14-15, Exhibit R-26.\n\n499.\n\nThe Investors, however, did not at the time complain about the process for finalizing the EIS Guidelines or the length or onerousness of the final EIS. On the other hand, they did make several specific comments about the draft EIS. They pointed out that contrary to an implication of the draft EIS Guidelines, members of the public do not evaluate the project; they comment on it; the Panel and regulatory agencies do the evaluation.710 The Investors also requested that the concept of adaptive management be mentioned in the final EIS Guidelines.711 This concept involves monitoring impacts and revising mitigation measures. It could address situations where environmental harm is not likely, but where there is still uncertainty about the effectiveness of mitigation measures.712 The final EIS Guidelines did in fact make express provisions for Bilcon to propose such adaptive management measures.713\n\nLetter from Paul Buxton to the Joint Review Panel, dated 16 January 2005, p. 1, Exhibit R-243.\n\nLetter from Paul Buxton to the Joint Review Panel, dated 16 January 2005, p. 1, Exhibit R-243.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, paras. 356 et seq.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement Guidelines for the Review of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project (final), dated March 2005, p. 52, Exhibit C-168.\n\n500.\n\nMr. Estrin in his expert reports expresses concerns about the introduction of the \"precautionary principle\" into the final version of the EIS Guidelines. In the end, however, his concern related to the interpretation of the principle by the Panel, rather than its being considered. In Mr. Estrin's view, the JRP later construed the precautionary principle in a manner that placed an onus on Bilcon to prove that the project would not cause any environmental damage, rather than recognizing that uncertainty may be inevitable, cannot paralyze a project, and that adaptive management can be undertaken by means that include monitoring and revised mitigation measures.714\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 217.\n\n501.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the process and the end product of finalizing the EIS Guidelines did not in themselves constitute breaches of NAFTA.\n\niii. The JRP Report's Emphasis on Community Core Values\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nVarious issues concerning the way in which the JRP conducted the hearings are best understood in light of its eventual report.\n\n503.\n\nThe JRP Report concluded that the project should not be approved. The Report introduces a term not mentioned in any of the statutes, regulations, or EIS Guidelines: \"community core values\". The Report expressly identifies only one effect of the project as both significant and adverse, namely \"inconsistency with community core values\".715 With respect to other impacts of the project, the Panel allowed that \"with the effective application of appropriate mitigation measures, competent project management and appropriate regulatory oversight, most project effects should not be judged \u2018significant'\".716\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 84, Exhibit C-34/212; Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 207.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 84, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n504.\n\nFurthermore, the JRP does not propose any mitigation measures in respect of its point-by-point review of specific effects of the project. In summarizing its overall conclusion the Report states that the project would have significant adverse effects, but does not mention the test of \"after mitigation\", which is an integral part of the mandate of a Panel under s. 16 of the *CEAA*.717 The Chair of the Panel later explained in a radio interview:\n\nIn the past, almost always, Panels that, well, if you changed your mind or you overrule us this is what you have to do in order to let this go forward. We were so certain that this was a bad thing that it was inappropriate for that for that [sic] particular environment that we did not provide any of those mitigating recommendations at all. And I think many people pointed to that and that was a very conscious effort on our part.718\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 103, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nTranscript of Dr. Fournier's interview with CBC Radio, dated 20 December 2007, Exhibit C-180, discussed in Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 296.\n\n505.\n\n\"Community core values\" played a predominant role in the Report's conclusion that the project should not proceed, and in its abstention from identifying mitigation measures. In addressing the dispute over whether Bilcon was ever given a fair chance to make its case that blasting would not cause adverse environmental effects, counsel for Canada reaffirmed its position719\u2014and in the Tribunal's view, correctly\u2014as follows in closing argument:\n\nFirst the lack of test blasting on the 3.9 hectare quarry was not relied upon by the Joint Review Panel as a reason to recommend against the approval of the Whites Point project. The project's inconsistency with community core values was the reason underlying the panel's recommendation. This was confirmed by both Mr. Rankin and Mr. Estrin in their testimonies, and it was conceded by Mr. Appleton in his opening statement.720\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 253-256; Rejoinder, para. 58; JRP Report, dated October 2007, pp. 14, 101107, Exhibit C-34/R-212 are the references cited in Canada's annotated closing argument, Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 153.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 153.\n\n506.\n\nThe meaning of \"community core values\" is unclear from the JRP Report. There are at least four possible interpretations of \"community core values\" as used by the JRP, and the Tribunal will review the legal and factual tenability of each of them. The Tribunal is satisfied that even if these four interpretations were to be viewed as less than entirely exhaustive of what the JRP had in mind, they do, individually or in combination, reflect in at least large measure the JRP's intended meaning.\n\n*Community core values as the majority public opinion in the community about the project*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nThe concept of \"community core values\" might be interpreted as referring in part to current opinion about the acceptability of the project in the local communities in the project vicinity. At one point the Chair of the Panel stated:\n\nMr. Thibault, in some small way this is a kind of referendum, isn't it, in that, on one hand, you have people arguing for a traditional way of life that goes back more than a century, and you have others arguing that the future rests with industrialization or commercialization and so forth.721\n\nJoint Review Panel Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, Public Hearing, Volume 11, 28 June 2007, p. 2669, Exhibit C-163.\n\n508.\n\nThe JRP Report would later conclude that \"[t]he proposal is not consistent with core values and community visions of the future as expressed in documents, by community leaders and *by the majority of community members appearing before the Panel*.\"722 To the extent that the notion of \"community core values\" is construed as representing the level of local support for a project, the Tribunal concludes that there is no mandate in federal Canada's environmental assessment system or the Nova Scotia regime for a review panel to make recommendations on such a basis. The function of a review panel is to gather and evaluate scientific information and input from the community and to assess a project in accordance with the standards prescribed by law, not to conduct a plebiscite. On this point, all the experts, including Mr. Smith, concurred.723\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 70, Exhibit C-34/R-212 (emphasis added).\n\nTestimony of Lawrence Smith, Hearing Transcript, 30 October 2013, p. 142: \"First off, let me deal with the referendum aspect. You wouldn't have needed to have a hearing if it was a referendum. You know, there was a full, thorough, rigorous hearing fully detailed. So that would be my primary response to that one.\" First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 292: \"I am in agreement with Mr. Estrin that the *CEAA* does not grant a community \u2018veto' over proposed development. The Panel, however, did not confer such a veto upon the local community.\" Mr. Smith stated that in his view instead the Panel took into account effects on the community as per the Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines; ibid, para. 294. Expert Report of Murray Rankin, in paras 123-135, rejects the \"community core values\" approach in its entirety.\n\n509.\n\nAs Mr. Estrin testified, \"[a]n EA panel is not a forum that is meant to (or equipped to) ascertain the will of the majority\".724 As a matter of fact, what the balance of opinion was at the time of the hearing is difficult to know. The detailed studies Bilcon commissioned in the context of its community health and wellness report include a 2005 survey of community attitudes. The survey indicates strong awareness that a project might proceed, but many respondents were not knowledgeable about basic issues such as the site of the project, how many jobs it would create and how long it would last. Out of the 465 responses, 30.5% of respondents thought the project was a good idea, 48.2% thought it was a bad idea, and 21.3% did not know.725 At the hearing, most of the community members who spoke were opposed. Yet there were strong supporters as well, and over three hundred community members signed a petition in support that was submitted to the JRP.\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 193.\n\nHuman Health and Community Wellness Assessment for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Environmental Impact Statement, Digby Neck, Nova Scotia, Appendix B, p. 90, Exhibit C-431.\n\n510.\n\nThe petition states that the signers are \"of the opinion that the jobs that will be created by this project are vital to the economic future of this area given the catastrophic decline in the fishery\".726 Ms. Cindy Nesbitt testified at the hearing as follows:\n\n...why go ahead with this Project? Because the year-round local people want it. We present to you this evening a petition signed by locals, not tourists who will be here once, or property owners who live elsewhere and visit occasionally. This is the real thing. There would be more signatures, but people are still living in the shadow of intimidation..727\n\n[t]here are a number of people that still would have signed the petition, but for one reason or another, we didn't get a chance to speak to them or they were intimidated and didn't want to sign, and they weren't sure of where these names were going to go.728\n\nPetition to Federal Minister of the Environment, Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour, in support of the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal, signed by over 300 full-time residents, Exhibit C-182.\n\nJRP Hearing Transcript, Vol. 9, dated 26 June 2007, p. 2106, Exhibit C-162.\n\nJRP Hearing Transcript, Vol. 9, dated 26 June 2007, p. 2123, Exhibit C-162.\n\n511.\n\nMs. Nesbitt provided examples of the actions against her because of her role as Chair of the Community Liaison Committee:\n\nWell, at times things went quite well and at times I was treated like a pariah. My car was keyed. When I was invited back to see the sediment ponds early on, my car was keyed. Our business has been boycotted. That's not exclusive to me, though. One of our other representatives had her car keyed, and a number of people on the committee have found less than friendly responses at times from people who are opposed to the project.729\n\nJRP Hearing Transcript, Vol. 9, dated 26 June 2007, p. 2125, Exhibit C-162.\n\n512.\n\nMs. Nesbitt testified that the Community Liaison Committee wanted \"to have an opportunity to bring transparency to the process\". She expressed the hope that the Committee would be \"helping\" to \"bring this information to the community\", so it could \"make a decision based on information instead of propaganda or fear\". However, the Community Liaison Committee eventually stopped meeting \"because people were given a hard time over participating\".\n\n513.\n\nFurthermore, the state of local opinion is not a matter that is fixed prior to or at the outset of a Review Panel hearing. The environmental process is intended to be part of the earlier stages of a planning process in which input can be used to improve the design of a project and mitigation measures in the interest of protecting the environment. Public opinion may evolve in light of the information gathered at the public hearing, by experts and members of the public, by changes to the design of the project and mitigation measures proposed by the proponent or recommended by the Review Panel or the government, and by the assessment of the likelihood and magnitude of adverse effects after mitigation contained in the review Panel's Report. What the actual state of local public opinion would have been in the end, had the JRP Report carried out its required \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" mandate, cannot be known. Bilcon's EIS submitted that \"since no significant adverse environmental effects were identified by the environmental assessment, the project activities (construction and operation) are not expected to have an adverse effect on social cohesion as it relates to social capital.\"730\n\nEnvironment Impact Statement, Volume I, plain language summary, p. 40, Exhibit C-1.\n\n514.\n\nTo put the matter in terms of the \"referendum\" concept: even if a referendum had been the lawfully prescribed means of deciding the fate of the project\u2014which it was not\u2014the referendum question might be framed very differently if the JRP Report had first carried out the prescribed assessment of project impacts and proposed a set of mitigation measures, rather than allow \"community core values\" to override that part of its mandate. The answer provided by voters in a hypothetical referendum following a JRP Report might have been significantly influenced by a JRP Report that evaluated the likelihood and significance of the project in the comprehensive manner contemplated by the *CEAA*. It is not consistent with the *CEAA*, and it is fundamentally unfair, in the Tribunal's view, to subject a proponent to the very public venting of criticism at a public hearing, with all the attendant expense and reputational risk, without providing both the public and the ultimate government decision makers with a final report that includes the thorough and methodical assessment of environmental effects and consideration of mitigation measures promised by the *CEAA* based on a fair evaluation of all the evidence.\n\n*Community core values as local values enshrined in authoritative documents including the Vision 2000 statement*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nThe JRP Report might be interpreted, however, as understanding community core values as being defined not by the majority of opinion expressed at the hearing, but by reference to values previously crystallized in various authoritative documents. The JRP refers to a variety of vision statements and federal and provincial policies and laws. These include federal Canada and Nova Scotia environmental statutes, which require a JRP to consider the extent to which economic development can be reconciled with and reinforce environmental integrity. They do not preemptively determine that a project like the one proposed is prohibited, but rather set out a framework to evaluate the risks and consider mitigation measures. Policy statements at the provincial level, as already canvassed, welcomed coastal mining and export projects that were consistent with the protection of the environment. At several times the JRP referred to the document \" *Building Tomorrow-Vision 2000: Multi-year Community Action Plan for Annapolis and Digby Counties\"*. The JRP Report states that:\n\nThe Western Valley Development Authority was a regional development authority forged as a partnership among the two senior levels of government, the seven municipal governments found in Digby and Annapolis counties, and the public. In 1998 and 1999 it facilitated 23 community meetings to discuss values and hopes for the region's future. Additional activities addressed the role of culture in community building, surveyed businesses to assess the needs of the private sector, and engaged the community through an on-line dialogue. The outcome of these efforts was the document *Building Tomorrow -Vision 2000: Multi-year Community Action Plan for Annapolis and Digby Counties*.\n\nThe action plan addressed eight sectors of the human and natural environments. The four most relevant to the proposed project are described here. One goal is to develop a climate which supports local business development, entrepreneurship, investment, and the attraction of new business. Also of note are objectives to accelerate opportunities for growth through an export development strategy, to provide support for local entrepreneurs and to encourage a more diversified, year-round economy. Another goal is to develop a community-based plan for natural resource management that includes processing resources in the local area. *The planning exercise recognized that opportunities exist within the* *region to develop primary industries, including mining, and that primary processing of natural resources can be carried out in a way that both maintains and even enhances the region's unique culture and environment.* However, the residents of the area recognized that careful, sustainable use of the region's natural resources is required to ensure economic opportunities for many generations to come. The action plan identified the need for the development and implementation of sustainable management plans for each resource use sector and for those plans to be placed in the context of the regional ecology.\n\nThe Vision exercise found that the residents of Annapolis and Digby counties wish to promote environmental stewardship practices which preserve the region's biological diversity and ecological heritage. They embrace the concept of sustainable development and see future social activity carried out in a way that preserves and promotes ecological heritage. They recognize the need for an integrated approach to environmental management.\n\n**Is the Vision still valid?**\n\nThe seven partnering municipalities in the region endorsed *Vision 2000* as a policy document for future developments. Subsequently, some municipal governments withdrew their funding for the development authority and the WVDA ceased to operate. A new community economic development organization is now in place with a new planning process initiated.\n\nThe Proponent suggested that the collapse of the WVDA was related to new businesses failing to materialize. This position was not supported by community political representatives or others. Submissions to the Panel indicated that support for the policies of *Vision 2000* remain strong.\n\nRegardless of the current status of the development authority that facilitated the creation of the Vision, the Panel accepted that the *Vision 2000* document remained a valid expression of the residents of the region on their own future.\n\n*Vision 2000* establishes a goal of developing and promoting cultural heritage and tourism attractions. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is singled out due to its importance to Digby Neck and the Islands. The planning document speaks to the need for great care to be taken to prevent economic growth and development from eroding the qualities that continue to draw people to the region.731\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, pp. 119-120, Exhibit C-34/R-212 (emphasis added).\n\n516.\n\nTo the extent that the JRP views *Vision 2000* as authoritative because \"support for it remains strong\", there remains the difficulty of determining majority opinion and the fact that local majority rule was not a criterion for decision in any event.\n\n517.\n\nIf the *Vision 2000* statement is examined on its own terms, however, it cannot reasonably be deployed to override and pre-empt precisely the exercise that was mandated under the applicable federal Canada and Nova Scotia environmental laws. In the passage from the *Vision 2000* statement reproduced by the JRP, there is an express statement that \"[t]he planning exercise recognized that opportunities exist within the region to develop primary industries, including mining, and that primary processing of natural resources can be carried out in a way that both maintains and even enhances the region's unique culture and environment.\" The *Vision 2000* does state that \"great care\" must be taken to preserve the qualities that attract people to the region. The carrying out of an environmental assessment by a JRP, however, ought precisely to be an exercise in taking great care in all respects concerning the environment.\n\n518.\n\nThe *Vision 2000* statement elsewhere proposes that \"it seems clear to residents of the region that our carrying capacity, our ability to generate wealth from our natural resources, is greater than that currently being exploited. New opportunities in farming, fishing, mining and forestry beckon for those who can adequately reconcile the twin concerns of economic growth and resource utilization\".732 The reconciliation of those concerns\u2014economic development and environmental integrity\u2014is, of course, precisely the objective of both federal Canada and Nova Scotia's environment assessment statute. There is no more thorough process contemplated by these statutes, and none more engaging of public input, than the process of involving a Review Panel.\n\nBuilding Tomorrow, Vision 2000, p. 29, Exhibit C-181.\n\n519.\n\nThe proponent submitted that the project would not, after mitigation measures, likely cause significant adverse effects. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that many, indeed most, industrial mining projects in the Digby area would not pass muster under an environmental assessment, the issue before the JRP would still be whether *this particular project* could be designed and carried out in a way that avoided likely significant adverse effects after mitigation. The proponent contended, with the support of its EIS and all the scientific expertise and community consultation that went into it, that its particular project would address all the concerns identified under federal Canada and Nova Scotia laws, as particularized in the EIS Guidelines.\n\n*Community core values as local self-determination in planning matters*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nThe JRP Report suggests in places that community core values include local community planning and self-determination, and that proceeding with the project would damage those values. The Panel at one point states that:\n\nThe Municipality of the District of Digby has not adopted a municipal planning strategy or zoning. Given that municipalities cannot regulate mining or quarrying, a community plan would not give the municipality any ability to control land use in this case. As participants in the review process argued, the lack of a plan does not mean that the people of Digby Neck and the Islands do not have a vision for their future. The Panel accepted this position and sought direction from other planning policies.733\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 119, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n521.\n\nThe JRP refers to community \"self-determination\" in a number of ways. First, \"these reports [in the Vision 2000 Statement] strongly articulate the community's desire for co-operative self-determination\".734 Secondly, \"the Panel concludes that the Project is generally not consistent with government or community policy about community economic development\".735 Thirdly, \"individuals repeatedly referred to the importance of community unity and the need for local participation in any decision process. People in Digby Neck and Islands believe strongly in selfdetermination and self-sufficiency\".736 Finally, \"[t]he imposition of a major long-term industrial site on a community that has spoken in strong terms about the need to take a different development path could transform the community with a randomness that communities seek to avoid by engaging in deliberative processes of vision and planning to identify desirable futures\".737\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 93, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 95, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 99, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 100, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n522.\n\nIn a radio interview after the release of the JRP Report, Dr. Fournier stated:\n\nThis is a community that has defined itself before the assessment began as environmentally oriented and it defined itself in such a way as that there really was not very much room there for a quarry as was being proposed.738\n\nTranscription by Appleton & Associates of the CBC Interview with Robert Fournier, dated 20 December 2007, Exhibit C-180.\n\n523.\n\nAs noted above, all three experts who testified on the point, Mr. Estrin, Mr. Rankin and Mr. Smith, however, agreed that there was no \"community veto\" under the law. In the Tribunal's view, where the law of a province did not vest authority in a municipality or a particular group of citizens within it to decide on whether a quarry project should proceed, it could not have been within the authority of the JRP to effectively confer such authority. Neither did the provincial laws in place effectively place a moratorium on quarry applications being approved until a local community planning process was in place.\n\n524.\n\nLooking at the specific facts of this case, it is difficult to see how \"community core values\" that emphasized local planning could be elevated to an overriding factor that militated against the Bilcon project\u2014one that pre-empted the usual \"likely adverse significant effects after mitigation analysis\" to the whole range of effects\u2014given the fact that the local government had not adopted a planning strategy or zoning. The *Vision 2000* Statement had suggested that many in the local community were indeed interested in local planning, and the Tribunal accepts the JRP's finding that many still were, but the planning process established by binding provincial law and administrative decisions at the time included a JRP, with all the opportunities for community input prior to and at the hearings.\n\n525.\n\nA general observation on \"community core values\", no matter which interpretation is adopted of the JRP's approach to them, concerns the compatibility of the concept with the *CEAA* requirement that there be a biophysical pathway to effects that are assessed. The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Estrin's analysis that incompatibility with \"community core values\" absent some ecological impact is not within the scope of what is assessable under the terms of the *CEAA*.739\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 257-268.\n\n526.\n\nMr. Estrin testified that there was a constitutional, and not merely statutory, limitation on importing \"community core values\" concept into an environmental assessment under the terms of the *CEAA* :\n\nEven Robert Thibault, the former federal Fisheries Minister (and then still the local Member of Parliament), acknowledged as much in his appearance before the JRP:\n\nThe Federal Government's responsibility is on the environmental side and protection of the water and protection of marine habitat. When you get to the quality of life side, what do you want in your community, then that's a provincial responsibility. And in most areas within that, it's delegated to the municipalities where you can have zoning by-laws and you can regulate what is happening in your communities.\n\nThe Federal Government simply had no jurisdiction to consider such purely local questions in making its decision about whether or not to allow the project to proceed.740\n\nMr. Rankin, when asked, took no position on the constitutional issue.741 Mr. Smith took the view that the review was a joint federal-provincial exercise, and that whatever the scope of federal Canada's authority was, Nova Scotia did have a constitutional authority over local matters.742 The Tribunal recognizes that constitutional doctrine can be complex, controversial and shifting, and that none of the three experts were specialists in constitutional law. The Tribunal is not convinced on the basis of that evidence or the materials submitted as a whole that the constitutional objection identified by Mr. Estrin is sufficiently clear to be a factor in the Tribunal's decision that there was a breach of the international minimum standard.\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 306-307 (emphasis added in Mr. Estrin's Report).\n\nHearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 645.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 205.\n\n527.\n\nMr. Smith suggested that socio-economic impacts unmediated by biophysical pathways are contemplated by the Nova Scotia legislation. Even if this is so, it would not relieve the JRP and ultimately federal Canada authorities of their duty to identify whether the project passed muster under a thorough review of potential effects under the *CEAA* standard of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation.\n\n528.\n\nMr. Estrin and Mr. Rankin both testified743, however, that \"community core values\" as used by the JRP were not within the scope of environmental assessment contemplated by the Nova Scotia as well as federal Canada statute. They were matters of philosophical belief, not effects that could be assessed and mitigated. Although the point about the Nova Scotia statute is not decisive in the present case, the Tribunal agrees. The statutes are concerned with effects on actual biophysical and socioeconomic conditions rather than with matters of political or philosophical belief, such as that a local community should have a veto over a project even if the law does not so provide. Mr. Smith himself appeared to be referring to not only the federal Canada statute, but rather Nova Scotia's as well, when he confirmed his agreement that there was no \"community veto\" under the law.\n\nTestimony of David Estrin, Hearing Transcript, 22 October 2013, p. 247; Testimony of Murray Rankin, Hearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 642.\n\n*Community core values as \"community DNA\"*\n------------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nThe JRP Report attempted to explain and defend its \"community core values\" concept by way of analogy:\n\nThe following analogy, although not perfect, provides a perspective on the potential impact of the proposed quarry and marine terminal on the communities of Digby Neck and Islands.\n\nDNA occurring in all living cells can be thought of as the cell's \"core values\" in that it is a repository of information acquired through evolution that ultimately defines the form and function of that cell. The information contained in the DNA is transferred through the \"expression\" of specific protein molecules that eventually confer unique characteristics to that cell, thereby defining it relative to other cells. A community's core values are also acquired through time and interaction; they represent information that governs the uniqueness of the community. The information contained in a community's core values is \"expressed\" in the community through specific outcomes such as: the elaboration of a common community vision; an understanding as to the role of environment in economic development; or general acknowledgment of the importance of traditional values. These outcomes are characteristics that define and distinguish one community from another.\n\nUnwanted changes often occur in DNA, resulting from chance mutations during cell division or as a result of some long-term environmental impact, e.g., exposure to toxic chemicals or excessive ultraviolet light. The changed DNA then produces altered protein molecules that irrevocably alter the cell's defining characteristics. In a similar way, unwanted long-term impacts on a community can bring about transformation of its core values, resulting in altered outcomes that irrevocably change the community.\n\nChange is a natural and often welcomed occurrence in both cells and communities. In biology, it is the fundamental underpinning of the process of natural selection, a random process in which success is measured, over very long time spans, by an organism's \"fitness\" in its environment. Many mutations result in changes that create organisms totally unfit for their surroundings, and those organisms are unsuccessful; mutations that make an organism better adapted will be reproduced, contributing to evolutionary change.\n\nWith communities the analogy breaks down at this point because humans exercise reason and free will. People are free to take stock and they are free to make changes in concert with accepted community standards. In other words, community change need not be a random process. Deciding on development directions typically involves a process of thoughtful deliberation, community introspection and conscious decision-making. Such a participatory community development approach has been reinforced by higher levels of government and recognized nationally and internationally as integral to a model of sustainable community development.\n\nThe imposition of a major long-term industrial site on a community that has spoken in strong terms about its intention to take a different developmental path could transform the community with a randomness that communities seek to avoid by engaging in deliberative processes of visioning and planning to identify desirable futures.\n\nThe Panel considers the community's core values to be a Valued Environmental Component, as important to the broader ecosystem as any other part of the environment. From the body of accumulated evidence, the Panel concludes that the implementation of the proposed Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal complex would introduce a significant and dramatic change to Digby Neck and Islands, resulting in sufficiently important changes to that community's core values that warrant the Panel describing them collectively as a Significant Adverse Environmental Effect that cannot be mitigated.744\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 100, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal's understanding is that the whole purpose of a JRP process was not to submit to \"randomness\" but precisely to engage in a thorough, methodical, evidence-based, consultative and deliberate planning exercise, and thereby address the risks of the project, assess their magnitude and likelihood and help find ways to mitigate them. Bilcon's position, supported by its scientific submissions and some community members, was not simply that it would take the community on a different development path. Rather, Bilcon's position was that the development would provide job opportunities that would help to sustain a community that was losing its young people to outmigration, and could be carried out in a way that would not have the likely effect of significantly damaging other valued components of the ecosystem. Bilcon, in response to the final EIS Guidelines, had submitted a volume on impacts on the various social issues therein identified.\n\n531.\n\nTo avoid any possible misunderstanding, the Tribunal has absolutely no doubt that the extent to which community members value various assessable components can be an entirely legitimate part of an environmental assessment. If some or all members of a community place a significant value on auditory quiet or a view of nature unmarred by development, or the ability to continue engaging in traditional economic or recreational activities, or community cohesion, these effects might be included in an assessment under the laws of Canada, and in fact in appropriate cases could lead to a finding of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation. A wide range of potential social effects were in fact mandated for study by the EIS Guidelines in our case, and Bilcon devoted considerable resources to commissioning and presenting studies on them. The Tribunal takes issue with the \"community core values\" approach as presented and applied by the JRP, not with the notion that the valuation placed on assessable components can be an integral part of conducting a proper assessment, including the assessment of social effects.\n\n532.\n\nTo sum up so far, \"community core values\" as used by the JRP might have meant any or some combination of: majority opinion in the community on the project at the time of the hearings; the existence of earlier community statements such as *Vision 2000* that supposedly crystallized community values and determined against locating an industrial mine and quarry project in the area; an implicit requirement that a local community planning process has authorized the project; and the protection of the \"community DNA\" from random mutations.\n\n533.\n\nIt might be that the JRP intended that various facets of its \"community core values\" approach should be combined in some fashion to produce its overall meaning. The end product, however, would be at least as problematic as the parts considered individually. It would not be consistent with what the JRP actually said and did to subtract all of these facets and insist instead that \"community core values\" is merely a compendious term for a certain set of environmental effects that were assessed in the ordinary and expected manner.\n\n534.\n\nWhatever interpretation is taken of the \"community core values\" approach by the JRP, it was at the very least a highly problematic basis for the Tribunal to rest its recommendations. Moreover, it was a serious breach of the law on procedural fairness that Bilcon was denied reasonable notice of the \"community core values\" approach as taken by the Tribunal, and the opportunity to seek clarification and respond to it.\n\n535.\n\nWhile it is not strictly necessary to decide the point in order to resolve this case, the Tribunal's respectful view is that the \"community core values\" approach actually went beyond being just problematic and that on any of its plausible interpretations it does not by itself warrant a finding of \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\". In any event, it appears certain to the Tribunal that the JRP was, regardless of its \"community core values\" approach, still required to conduct a proper \"likely significant effects after mitigation\" analysis on the rest of the project effects. By not doing so, the JRP, to the prejudice of the Investors, denied the ultimate decision makers in government information which they should have been provided.\n\n536.\n\nWith respect to the issue of reasonable notice, Mr. Buxton states in his witness statement:\n\nNever, during the entire environmental assessment process, was I or any of Bilcon's experts required to address the concept of \"core values\". \"Core Values\" was never mentioned in the EIS Guidelines or the Terms of Reference.745\n\nWitness Statement of Paul Buxton, para. 76.\n\n537.\n\nIn his oral testimony, Mr. Buxton confirmed that he \"never heard the term during the entire process, including at the hearings\"746 and that \"it was not mentioned anywhere in the document, and I even have a problem now reading the definitions in the panel report and trying to discern exactly what the panel was getting at by core values\".747\n\nTestimony of Paul Buxton, Hearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 471, lines 3-5.\n\nTestimony of Paul Buxton, Hearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 471, lines 22-24.\n\n538.\n\nWhen asked at the hearing whether Dr. Fournier's reference to a \"bit of a referendum\" gave him a \"head's up\" that the community core values approach was in play, Mr. Clayton responded:\n\nI wouldn't have attached community values or core values, or whatever they were, to that statement, but it certainly shocked me that, in any way, shape or form, the panel should think that it was there to do a head count of who was for and who was against the quarry.\n\nThat really, really shook me.748\n\nTestimony of William Richard Clayton, Hearing Transcript, 23 October 2013, p. 507, lines 21-25; p. 508, lines 1-3.\n\n539.\n\nMr. Rankin in his expert report states that Bilcon was denied its right under public administrative law to have fair notice of the case to be met. He specifically addresses the expert opinion of Mr. Smith that the EIS Guidelines, although not using the term \"community core values\", provided sufficient notice in respect of the JRP's eventual application of that concept. Mr. Rankin notes that the JRP, in elaborating on its \"community core values\" concept, says that some might refer to the area as a \"sacred landscape\". Mr. Rankin observes:\n\nThe question must be posed: how could any proponent effectively participate in an environmental review where the notion of operating in a \"sacred landscape\" is raised? As a matter of procedural fairness, absolutely no notice was provided that this was the \"case to meet\" for Bilcon. This standard is even more unattainable when one considers the fact that other quarries, such as the Tiverton Quarry\u2014presumably likewise located in a closely neighboring \"sacred landscape\"\u2014did not even require a panel review.749\n\nExpert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 134.\n\n540.\n\nMr. Rankin further expresses the opinion that various references in the EIS to specific items such as \"community health\" did not amount to adequate forewarning of the JRP's adoption of its much more wide-ranging \"community core values\" concept.750\n\nExpert Report of Murray Rankin, paras. 129-132.\n\n541.\n\nMr. Estrin arrived at the same conclusion as Mr. Rankin concerning the lack of fair notice concerning \"community core values\". He states:\n\nMr. Smith points to certain vague terms that were included in the Guidelines, such as the \"social and cultural health\" of local communities. But he does not refute my essential point, which is that the Guidelines did not speak of \"community core values\" per se, and did not \"give any hint, except perhaps in hindsight, that the Panel considered community core values to be, in and of themselves, a \u2018valued environmental component' that must be protected.\" I disagree with Mr. Smith's assertion that Bilcon had \"clear and detailed instructions from the Panel about what would be required to fulfil the requirements of the Final EIS Guidelines.\"\n\nBilcon clearly felt blindsided by the Panel's reliance on this notion. In a letter to the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment and Labour shortly after the Panel Report was released, Mr. Buxton wrote on behalf of Bilcon:\n\nThe Panel made up the notion it called the \"core values\" of the community.... We had no indication the Panel was going to do this. We have had no opportunity to respond.751\n\nIn his Affidavit, Mr. Buxton states:\n\nNever, during the entire environmental assessment process, was I or any of Bilcon's experts required to address the concept of \"core values\". \"Core Values\" was never mentioned in the EIS Guidelines or the Terms of Reference.\"752\n\nI stand by the view I expressed in my First Report that Bilcon's frustration was reasonable, and that the Panel's reliance on the novel concept of community core values was a breach of the duty of fairness.753\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 212-213.\n\nCited in Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 214.\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 215.\n\n542.\n\nMr. Rankin quotes in support of his analysis an on-line commentary by a trio of environmental lawyers in response to the Whites Point JRP Report. The commentary concludes:\n\nWhile a consideration of \"core values\" could potentially fit within a significance determination structure, by making sustainability a separate, stand-alone consideration, the Panel's analysis is inconsistent with the significant effects analysis upon which a panel must base its recommendations.\n\nThere is no question that sustainable development remains a noble aim and a fundamental objective of environmental assessment. The two decisions discussed above illustrate that review panels, on their own initiative and inappropriately, are moving towards expanding the role of sustainable development in their analysis and decision making within environmental impact reviews. The problem with this development is that is not consistent with, nor is it supported by, existing environmental assessment legislation. It therefore presents a risk to project proponents presently bringing forward their projects within the current legal framework.\n\nEnvironmental assessment is a legal process and the express direction articulated in environmental assessment legislation must be respected and adhered to. If policy-makers wish to see sustainable development take on a more prominent role in the process, those legislative changes should be pursued.754\n\nExpert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 135, quoting from S. Denstedt et al, \"Joint Review Panels Exceed Mandate with use of Sustainability Framework\", dated March 2008, Exhibit C-834. The Denstedt commentary also identifies the decision of the *Kemess Mines* JRP as also adopting an approach that was outside of its legal mandate. Whether that criticism of *Kemess* is valid the Tribunal need not itself decide. The *Kemess* JRP Report was issued after the Bilcon hearings were concluded, and only very shortly before the Bilcon JRP Report. The latter makes no mention of the former. Mr. Smith notes that the *Kemess* Report refers to concerns over matters such as \"spiritual values\" of a community in the project area, but that community is an Aboriginal one, and as Mr. Estrin points out, Aboriginal peoples have a distinctive, constitutionally protected position in the Canadian legal system.\n\n543.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Bilcon lacked reasonable notice of the \"community core values\" approach. The opinions of two eminent experts support the objective reasonableness of its surprise in this respect, as does the reaction of several independent commentators at the time. On its own review of all of the evidence, the Tribunal concurs that Bilcon had been denied a fair opportunity to know the case it had to meet and to address it.\n\n544.\n\nWith respect to the failure of the JRP to carry out the legally mandated analysis, Dr. Fournier in a radio interview made it clear that the Panel was very deliberate in its decision not to provide governments with recommendations as to possible mitigation measures:\n\nIn the past, almost always, Panels that, well, if you changed your mind or if you overrule us this is what you have to do in order to let this go forward. We were so certain that this was a bad thing that it was inappropriate for that particular environment that we did not provide any of those mitigating recommendations at all.755\n\nTranscription by Appleton & Associates of the CBC Interview with Robert Fournier, dated 20 December 2007, Exhibit C-180.\n\n545.\n\nMr. Estrin comments:\n\nThis statement is of particular concern. It demonstrates not only that the Panel considered the WPQ a \"bad thing\" but also indicates that the Panel refused to address possible mitigation measures in a deliberate effort to tie the hands of the governments whose statutory role was to decide whether to approve the project or not. In other words, the Panel structured its Report so that, even if Canada or Nova Scotia disagreed with the Panel's analysis of the environmental effects, it would be exceedingly difficult for either government to approve the project. This in my view was improper.756\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 297.\n\n546.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the Whites Point Quarry JRP was legally obliged under s. 16 of the *CEAA* to report on all factors mentioned there, including mitigation measures,757 The JRP could not \"take a pass\" on this part of its mandate. Mr. Estrin in fact concluded that \"the WPQ Panel was, as far as I can tell, the only panel under *CEAA* or a joint review process to have recommended the outright rejection of a project, without providing recommendations regarding mitigation should the government decision makers decide to approve it. Indeed the WPQ Panel chair, Robert Fournier, acknowledged to the press that this was unprecedented\".758 Even when all other JRPs recommended against a project, or abstained from making a recommendation, their standard practice, as required by applicable law, was to present possible mitigation measures.759\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 286\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 295.\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 290-294, citing the examples of *Kemess North Copper-Gold Mine* Project (where 32 mitigation measures were proposed in case Canada proceeded notwithstanding the Panel's recommendation against the project), Exhibit R-411; *Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine* Project (24 such recommendations), Exhibit R-429; and *Lower Churchill Hydroelectric Generation* Project (dozens of such recommendations), Exhibit R-414.\n\n547.\n\nThe JRP acknowledges that mitigation measures were possible in respect of many project effects of the WPQ project, although it does not choose to provide them. It does not explain why no mitigation measures at all were possible in respect of the \"community core values\", even if in the view of the JRP they would not have been entirely sufficient.\n\niv. Further Characteristics of the JRP Process and Report\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n548.\n\nA more detailed examination of how some of the specifics of the project were dealt with will further illustrate the Tribunal's concerns about the JRP's failure to fulfil its mandate under federal Canada's environment laws to conduct a rigorous analysis of the specifics of a project, including careful and comprehensive information-gathering, estimation of risks, and identification and evaluation of means of preventing or mitigating adverse effects.\n\n549.\n\nThe case law in Canada has affirmed that environmental assessment \"must be conducted as early as practicable in the planning stages of a project. By its very nature, the proceedings are subject to some uncertainty\".760 Project details may evolve during and after a Panel hearing. \"Since projects are submitted for environmental assessment at an early stage of their development, final determination of and amendment to project design and construction will continue well beyond the assessment stage.\"761 Given the early role of the environmental assessment process, environmental assessment panels in many cases attach conditions that will be enforced by licensing authorities, some of them cast in general terms that identify a goal or standard, rather than providing exhaustive detail as to how to achieve it.\n\n*Inverhuron & District Ratepayers Association v. Canada (Minister of the Environment),* 201 FCA 2013, para. 55, quoted in First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 355.\n\n*Pembina Institute for Appropriate Development v. Canada (Attorney General),* [2008] FCJ NO 324, para. 23, quoted in First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 356.\n\n550.\n\nJRPs have a positive duty by the end of the process to make sure there is sufficient information to make an assessment. S. 34 of the *CEAA* provides:\n\n34. A review panel shall, in accordance with any regulations made for that purpose and with its term of reference,\n\n(a) ensure that the information required for an assessment by a review panel is obtained and made available to the public.\n\n551.\n\nA JRP is cloaked with the authority to summon witnesses, including those not requested by the proponent intervener, and may retain its own experts. Panels are inquisitorial finders of fact, with a responsibility and the authority to obtain information where the submissions of participants in the process are otherwise insufficient to permit it to carry out its statutory mandate.762 The Terms of Reference for the Whites Point Quarry Panel provided that public hearings should only begin \"once the Panel is satisfied that sufficient information has been provided\".763\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 264.\n\nAgreement Concerning the Establishment of a Joint Review Panel for the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, between The Minister of the Environment, Canada and the Minister of Environment and Labour, Nova Scotia, Terms of Reference, Part II, para. 8, p. 8, Exhibit C-363.\n\n552.\n\nBilcon submitted a 17-volume EIS, which had been compiled over three and a half years, and included 48 experts' reports and 35 studies commissioned for the proposed project. In a least one respect, its analysis of impacts on biological organisms, a Nova Scotia official described the Statement as \"among the best I've seen\".764 The response of the JRP, however, was not consistent with the view that there was sufficient information to commence the public hearing processes. Mr. Hugh Fraser, an experienced journalist who attended the hearings as a public relations consultant to Bilcon, stated in his witness statement that:\n\nAs a professional observer, it appeared to me throughout that the Panel was taking sides, and showed little respect to Bilcon and its experts. The demeanour and conduct of Dr. Fournier, in particular, surprised me. Dr. Fournier is a well-regarded, popular weekly science columnist on CBC Radio on mainland Nova Scotia. His performance on radio is invariably scholarly, friendly, good humoured, educative, and professional. Dr. Fournier's performance at the Joint Review Panel hearings was far different. I recall observing at the hearings that he appeared more like a professor committed to embarrassing an unpopular student, while showing the entire class who was in charge and who had the right answers to all of the questions he was asking. *For example, at one point, Dr. Fournier inquired if any member of Bilcon's presentation team knew what \"the scientific method\" was*. The team, of course, consisted of experienced and qualified engineers and scientists.765\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, referring to testimony of Mark Elderkin from the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, para. 361.\n\nWitness Statement of Hugh Fraser, para. 13 (emphasis added).\n\n553.\n\nThe JRP made many information requests to Bilcon; its doing so, of course, is a reasonable part of a Panel's diligently carrying out its task. The JRP, however, barely questioned the experts assembled by Bilcon who were in attendance. As Mr. Estrin states in his expert report:\n\nBilcon had 19 experts in attendance at various points of the hearing. It would appear from a review of the transcripts that many of them were never asked a single question by the Panel, including experts in:\n\n\u2022 Accidents and malfunctions\n\n\u2022 Noise and air quality\n\n\u2022 Marine biology\n\n\u2022 Marine geology\n\n\u2022 Marine acoustics\n\n\u2022 Fisheries compensation\n\n\u2022 Bathymetry-Hydrogeology\n\nOthers were asked only cursory questions, including Carlos Johansen, a marine terminal engineer who flew in from Vancouver for the hearings. Following the hearings, Mr. Johansen wrote to the Federal Minister of the Environment and the Provincial Minister of Environment and Labour:\n\nI am a consultant to Bilcon of Nova Scotia and have been providing engineering services related to the shipping facilities for the proposed Whites Point Quarry. I have now been advised that the panel has recommended against the project proceeding. At great expense to Bilcon, I was asked to fly across Canada and be available on the first day of the Joint Panel hearings (June 16, 2007). I must express my disappointment at the proceedings. After sitting almost all day, I was finally asked one simple question related to the ship loading facilities. I was prepared to answer many more questions, but for whatever reason the panel chose not to question me further. I have not yet read every word in the panel's report, but I note reference to unanswered questions about ship loading and shipping. I wish I had been asked about some of them.766\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 417-418.\n\n554.\n\nAs noted in Mr. Fraser's Witness Statement, and quoted in Mr. Rankin's Expert Report the fact is:\n\nOver the 90 hours of hearings, Bilcon's experts testified for only 90 minutes or so.767\n\nWitness Statement of Hugh Fraser, para. 14, quoted in Expert Report of Murray Rankin, para. 102.\n\n555.\n\nThe JRP's Report on the specific issues is reflective of the overriding importance attached to \"community core values\" rather than the methodical examination of the specifics in the prescribed manner.\n\n556.\n\nAddressing potential concerns about the environmental impact of blasting was an objective of Bilcon from the early days of its involvement in the project. Its predecessor and then Bilcon itself had attempted to obtain a 3.9 ha quarry permit for purposes that included conducting test blasts. Bilcon claims it was unfairly and unlawfully frustrated in its attempts to obtain the permit years before the JRP commenced.\n\n557.\n\nThe JRP Report criticized Bilcon for submitting varying estimates of the amount of explosive material, Ammonium Nitrate-Fuel Oil, needed per tonne of basalt. The record demonstrates that Bilcon's evidence, provided by a blasting expert, was in fact consistent throughout the hearing. While Bilcon's EIS had originally estimated 0.4 kg per tonne, its expert explained at the hearing that that figure was based on a generic and typical value for the industry, but that the basalt material at the Whites Point site required only 0.23 kg of Ammonium Nitrate-Fuel Oil per tonne. He also conveyed this figure as one pound of explosive for two tonnes of rock. The JRP was mistaken to recall this estimate as one pound for one tonne of rock.768 The JRP ended up concluding that an estimate of 0.23 kg of Ammonium Nitrate-Fuel Oil per tonne was not \"credible\". The JRP's only basis for this conclusion, apart from its own misunderstanding of Bilcon's plainly stated evidence, was that a \"retired mining engineer\" had questioned Bilcon's blasting and noted inconsistencies in Bilcon's estimates.769 The \"retired mining engineer\" in question, however, was neither independent nor an expert in the relevant area. He was a leading opponent of the Whites Point Quarry from its outset. He had an education and experience in mining, but acknowledged at the hearing that he was \"not a blaster\" and had \"not been involved in blasting\".770 The JRP did not itself obtain an independent expert opinion, although it was dissatisfied with Bilcon's evidence and had the authority to do so.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 445-446, referring to John Melick's testimony at the public hearing (27 June 2007) and to the JRP Report, p. 28.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 448, referring to the JRP Report, pp. 28-29.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 450.\n\n558.\n\nIn citing concerns about blasting, the JRP did not invoke the language of \"likely\" or \"significant\" and did not provide analysis and conclusions that were equivalent to making such findings.\n\n559.\n\nThe JRP did not suggest any possible mitigation measures. Its failure to provide any such recommendations was inconsistent with the earlier history of government consideration of Bilcon's blasting. When attempts were made to obtain a 3.9 ha quarry permit, officials at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans had suggested such measures to prevent harm as requiring blasts to be a minimum distance from shore (a \"setback\")\u2014initially calculated by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans at 500 metres, and later modified to 100 meters771\u2014and monitoring the presence of whales and refraining from blasting if they were observed.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 150, citing Letter from Phil Zamora to Stephen Chapman, dated 17 September 2003, Exhibit C-188.\n\n560.\n\nThe Tiverton project on the Digby Peninsula was only ten kilometres away from the Whites Point area. It involved blasting on the seabed itself of 65,000 tonnes of rock to produce material for a new breakwater. This notwithstanding, the Tiverton project, which was carried out by the government of federal Canada and supported by Mr. Thibault, was approved after a screening, rather than a comprehensive study or JRP. Concerns about blasting were resolved by requiring mitigation measures. These included installing shock wave padding to minimize blast transmissions through the water. Adaptive management was part of the scheme. Monitoring of impacts, such as turbidity, was required, and if problems were detected, the work would be stopped and a federal official would be contacted to determine if additional mitigation measures were required.772 Blasting was permitted if it was in accordance with an existing plan approved by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, but the proponent was allowed flexibility in arriving at a final plan to carry out the project; if changes to the blasting plan were required, they would again be subject to approval by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix G, p. 4.\n\n561.\n\nCanada argues that the Tiverton project was different from Whites Point in a number of respects, such as the fact that blasting would only occur during construction rather than being an ongoing part of a long-term project. The Tribunal has no hesitation in acknowledging that such differences existed. It is certainly conceivable that the factual differences could justify different recommendations from an environmental assessment process. Federal Canada law, however, required consistency in the methodology of the assessments, including the need to thoroughly and objectively evaluate the impacts of the projects in terms of likelihood of adverse effects, their significance and possible mitigation.\n\n562.\n\nThe JRP cast doubt on various potential mitigation measures on the basis that they would not leave the project economically viable. Yet Bilcon itself had testified that it could still proceed with the project if mitigation measures were taken such as expanding the proposed coastal buffer zone from 30 metres to 100 metres. The JRP had no evidentiary basis to reject Bilcon's own estimates of economic viability in this respect.773\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 469.\n\n563.\n\nThe JRP at times used another rationale, closely related to its emphasis on community core values, for steering away from the lawfully prescribed and generally practiced approach to assessment methodology under the federal Canada system. The JRP focused at times on the relative extent to which project benefits and risks were local, regional, national and international. Thus, the JRP Report stresses the extent to which, in its view, the benefits of the project would be international and the burdens local, regional or national.\n\n564.\n\nSuch accounting is arguably somewhat skewed. Nowhere is it mentioned in the burden list, for example, that in return for whatever benefits would ensue, it was Bilcon that was taking on the very substantial investment risk. The litany of \"burdens\" does, however, list the fact that local governments do not impose a royalty tax on mineral extraction. It is not clear that this should be counted as a negative factor; whether it is a missed opportunity for a positive would depend in part on whether increasing the overall tax burden on investors might discourage out-of-province investors that Nova Scotia was seeking for its mining sector.\n\n565.\n\nIn any event, in the case of the Rabaska project a JRP774 identified the risks in unduly emphasizing the relative distribution of benefits and risks as between a local community and society in general. It noted that deferring to the objections of the community at the project site\u2014 which community might bear a disproportionate share of the environmental risk\u2014might at first sight seem fair. To apply this principle, however, on a society-wide basis would make \"the conduct of public affairs difficult, if not impossible\".775 A project that is in the general interest could not, in the end, actually be sited anywhere in particular. Mr. Estrin submits that it was in no way part of the mandate of a JRP under the *CEAA* to engage in balancing the social equities; it must evaluate environmental impacts that are likely to be caused by the project after mitigation through biophysical pathways, and \"public interest\" balancing is a concern for responsible authorities only where a project might have likely significant adverse effects after mitigation.776\n\nRabaska Project\u2014Implementation of an LNG Terminal and Related Infrastructure, Joint Review Panel, Main Report, dated May 2007, Exhibit R-432.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 489, quoting from Rabaska JRP Report, pp. 174-175.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 506.\n\n566.\n\nIn Mr. Estrin's view, the focus on the international benefits of the project was \"a useful subterfuge\" for an undercurrent of anti-Americanism. Mr. Estrin concludes that \"the very strong theme conveyed by the Whites Point Quarry Panel is that the Project is not worthy of approval because it will benefit U.S. corporations and consumers rather than the local citizens of Digby Neck\".777 The Tribunal is not convinced that it should adopt a characterization of the JRP's approach that is as stark as Mr. Estrin's. The JRP does acknowledge that the project would produce at least some local benefit as well as burdens, and it does not adopt the kind of overt anti-American rhetoric used by some participants. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the JRP Report is candid that its analysis of issues such as the \"significance\" of effects is strongly influenced by its perception of the relative distribution of benefits and burdens between the local and international communities:\n\nGiven the limited economic and social benefits of the Project to the local communities, the province, and the country, the Panel found the Project should not proceed in a situation where endangered species and a local way of life would be at risk due to project effects.778\n\nEven if it is assumed that the JRP had the authority under the *CEAA* to engage in a balancing of social equities, such public interest analysis could not relieve the JRP to also discharge its mandate of carefully investigating and evaluating specific project impacts in accordance with the prescribed methodology, including reporting on likely significant adverse effects after mitigation.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 505.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 103, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n567.\n\nAnother example of the JRP's approach to specific issues, referred to earlier, concerns the release of ballast water by ships arriving from other areas, which raises concerns about introducing invasive species. Bilcon committed to complying with federal Canada's Ballast Water Control and Management Regulations. The JRP, however, noted that these only require removal of 95%, rather than 100% and so does not eliminate risk altogether. The Panel does not provide an assessment of the likelihood and significance of the incremental risk caused by the project in comparison to that posed by traffic that would occur apart from the project. The JRP finds that Bilcon's proposed monitoring concerning invasive species for five years would not be sufficient to address situations where an unwanted organism has already been dispersed. The JRP does not indicate either what standard Bilcon should meet or what specific measures Bilcon should take to attain that standard. Rather, the JRP recommended in a general way that the applicable federal Canada regulations be rewritten\u2014a proposal not acted upon by federal officials. The treatment of the issue by the JRP stands in sharp contrast to the environmental assessment of the *Belleoram Quarry* and *Marine Terminal* project\u2014which was also sited in an environmentally sensitive coastal area and close to a community, and involved larger volumes of production of stone. The proponent in that case was a Canadian-controlled company. Federal Canada officials accepted as sufficient the proponent's undertaking to comply with federal Canada's regulations on ballast and to carry out other measures such as not releasing ballast water at the terminal site.779 The contrast is rendered even sharper by the fact that federal officials had recognized the similarity of the Belleoram and Whites Point projects, and many of the same offices and officials were involved with both.780\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 44.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 46, referring to E-mail from Barry Jeffrey to Steven Zwicker, dated 5 May 2006, Exhibit C-454.\n\n568.\n\nThe objective and rigorous evaluation of mitigation measures was further undermined by the JRP's unwarranted seizing on some proposed mitigation measures as themselves carrying environmental risks. Mr. Estrin's Expert Report notes the following:\n\nThe WPQ Panel questioned the proponent's purchase of additional buffer lands during the hearing process:\n\nAnd the buffer, what are called buffer properties that have been purchased by Bilcon of Delaware in the vicinity of the Project, there are a number of different kinds of uses that are suggested for those properties in the EIS buffer habitat areas. What prevents that from eventually becoming added to the quarry project site?\n\nThe proponent assured the WPQ Panel that the acquisition of such \"buffer properties\" was for the purposes of maintaining a buffer strip around the quarry, and that it was willing to consider proposals for conservation easement-type status for buffer lands to address the concern that these lands would be used for expansion:\n\nWe have no intention of employing that land other than as buffer strips. We have made the statement that if the local community wants to come to us and approach us for perhaps other uses of the lands, we would contemplate that.\n\nThe WPQ Panel appears to reject Bilcon's evidence in relation to the buffer lands, and to substitute its own view of Bilcon's plans for these lands. After reading in an intention to expand the quarry in the face of the proponent's explicit evidence to the contrary, the Panel then criticizes the proponent for failing to consider this \"expansion\" in the assessment of cumulative effects:\n\nOwnership of adjacent properties provides the Proponent with the potential opportunity of expansion. The Panel believes that expansion of the present Project and the development of an additional quarry or quarries is reasonably foreseeable, and that scenarios such as that should have been evaluated in the cumulative effects assessment.781\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 303-305.\n\n569.\n\nMr. Estrin testified that:\n\nGiven that the \"expansion\" at issue existed only in the minds of the WPQ Panelists\u2014and was explicitly denied by the proponent during the WPQ Panel hearings\u2014this critique of the proponent is at the least bewildering, but also consistent with bias against the project proceeding.782\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 306.\n\n570.\n\nThe JRP in the end recommended that \"coastal quarries should be viewed as special cases, warranting special consideration, especially within the context of a coastal management policy that defines principles relating to coastal land use\".783 The JRP Report further states that \"because of the special issues associated with coastal quarries, the Panel recommends a moratorium on new approvals for development along the North Mountain until the Province of Nova Scotia has thoroughly reviewed this type of initiative within the context of a comprehensive provincial coastal zone management policy, and established appropriate guidelines to facilitate decision-making\".784\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, p. 104, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\nJRP Report, dated October 2007, pp.104-105, Exhibit C-34/R-212.\n\n571.\n\nBilcon however could reasonably expect that its project would be considered within the context of the laws of the day. There was no provincial zoning policy in place that declared the Whites Point area a \"no go\" zone for quarries. There was in fact strong general encouragement from a number of politicians and technical officials and various policy statements for mining enterprises to pursue coastal opportunities, and there were very specific expressions of support from some elected politicians, including the representative for the area, and some technical officials to pursue a project in the Whites Point area. Bilcon was not told by Minister Thibault or officials of federal Canada or Nova Scotia at any time prior to the JRP's decision that the area was off-limits to quarry development, rather than having to be considered in the context of existing laws, policies and processes. The JRP, in its EIS Guidelines, did not indicate that a moratorium should be observed or the area should in effect be viewed as having a zoning plan in place that precluded major quarries.\n\n572.\n\nThis case would be more difficult if the issue were a duly enacted change by authorized lawmaking authorities to the zoning status of the Whites Point area while the Bilcon environmental assessment was already in progress, and substantial expenditures had taken place. NAFTA cases, such as *Mobil*785 and *Waste Management*,786 express a cautious approach about using investor expectations to stifle legislative or policy changes by state entities that have the authority to revise the law or policy. As lessons of experience are learned, as new policy ideas are advanced, as governments change in response to democratic choice, state authorities with the power to change law or policy must have reasonable freedom to proceed without being tasked with having breached the minimum standard under international law. That freedom is not absolute; breaches of the international minimum standard might arise in some special circumstances\u2014such as changes in a legal or policy framework that have retroactive effect, are not proceeded by reasonable notice, are aimed or applied in a discriminatory basis or are contrary to earlier specific assurances by state authorities that the regulatory framework would not be altered to the detriment of the investor.\n\n*Mobil Investments Canada Inc. & Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/04, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004.\n\n573.\n\nThe reality confronting Bilcon, however, is not that it was contending with a change in law or policy concerning the zoning of Whites Point by authorized authorities. It was faced with a fundamentally novel and adverse approach by an administrative body, the JRP, that had a mandate to apply existing federal Canada and Nova Scotia laws rather than to amend them.\n\n574.\n\nFinally, Bilcon submitted a witness statement from Mr. Hugh Fraser, an experienced journalist who attended the hearings as a consultant to Bilcon. His statement includes concerns about what might be called the \"atmospherics\" of the hearing. These include matters such as the allegedly scolding tone of the Chair's approach to Bilcon, the failure of the JRP on some (but not all) occasions to direct that those in attendance refrain from applauding denunciations of Bilcon or the project, and the Panel's tolerance of inflammatory statements from members of the public or politicians, including references to \"outsiders\" who wanted to \"rape and pillage\" the landscape.787 Mr. Fraser was not called for cross-examination, and no one who actually attended the hearing offered contrary evidence. The Tribunal has considered Mr. Fraser's evidence carefully, and reviewed the entire transcript to see the extent to which it finds support in the transcript. The Tribunal acknowledges that cold print does not always convey matters that can be felt by participants arising from such matters as the tone of voice and body language of those presiding at a hearing, making oral statements, or demonstrating on the sidelines.\n\nWitness Statement of Hugh Fraser, p. 9.\n\n575.\n\nFairness requires that a JRP conduct itself in a way that makes principals, advocates and witnesses for different sides all feel that their voices are being listened to by the Panel, and that they should not feel under emotional duress to refrain from providing their sincerely held points of view, and that the Panel has not closed its mind before all the submissions are in and duly considered. Those conducting a public hearing must have reasonable latitude, however, to express their thoughts and feelings as they go along, and give the participant the opportunity to respond and potentially change initial thoughts and sentiments. It can be important as well that participants and the public be able to draw assurance from the conduct of those presiding that they are engaged in a searching examination of the risks of a project, rather than accepting at face value the proponent's position and evidence. It is to be expected that members of the public, even politicians, addressing the audience at a public hearing on a controversial issue on which there is a division of thought and emotion in the community, will in some cases express themselves in a manner that reveals strong feelings about general issues, the project, or its proponent.\n\n576.\n\nIn the end, the Tribunal is not convinced from all the evidence that it should find a breach of NAFTA arising from the emotional environment at the JRP hearing.\n\nv. Governmental Acceptance of the JRP Report\n--------------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nAs both Parties agree, it was ultimately a set of decisions taken by the Governments of federal Canada and Nova Scotia, not the JRP Report itself, that led to the rejection of the Investors' project. The Tribunal shall accordingly deal with two related issues discussed by the Parties\u2014 the relationship of the decisions at both levels of Government and the level of independent scrutiny that these Governments were required to exercise in reviewing the JRP's recommendations.\n\n*Could the other part of the JRP's mandate, under the laws of Nova Scotia, justify or render moot conduct that would ordinarily be contrary to federal Canada law?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n578.\n\nAs noted earlier, Canada itself agrees that the dual mandate of the JRP required it to carry out its role under both federal Canada and Nova Scotia law; the existence of a second mandate does not justify failure to carry out a first one.\n\n579.\n\nCanada argues, however, that *NSEA* provides a broader or more flexible mandate than does its federal Canada counterpart, and that some contested aspects of the JRP's conduct are in fact justified by the Nova Scotia statute; and that in any event, if the Nova Scotia track, including environmental assessment and ultimate government decision-making, led to rejection of the project, any mistakes on the federal track were moot.\n\n580.\n\nThe Tribunal has already identified many problems with the adoption of the \"community core values\" approach, including lack of fair notice in this particular case, that extend to its adoption under the laws of Nova Scotia as well as federal Canada. Let it be supposed, however, for the sake of argument, that the JRP would and could still have recommended against the project under Nova Scotia law pursuant to a \"community core values\" approach supposedly permitted under Nova Scotia law. The fact would remain that the JRP might still have concluded that the project, at least with mitigation measures recommended by the JRP, passed muster under the federal Canada environmental law framework. With the benefit of a report compliant with the *CEAA* requirements, and a positive recommendation from the JRP on the federal Canada track, Nova Scotia decision-makers might have ultimately exercised their own discretion in favor of approving the project. Federal Canada officials might have concurred with the proponent in trying to persuade Nova Scotia officials of the merits of approving the project, even in the face of a negative recommendation from the JRP based on \"community core values\". Mr. Estrin testified that federal and provincial officials generally try to coordinate the content as well as the timing of their responses to a JRP,788 and the evidence in this case is that federal Canada and Nova Scotia officials were indeed in contact with each other shortly after the release of the JRP Report to discuss the likely response at each level.\n\nSecond Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 332, referring to E-mail from Peter Geddes to Stephen Chapman, dated 13 September 2007, Exhibit C-781, and E-mail from Paul Bernier to Nicole Gagnier, Exhibit C-782.\n\n581.\n\nA positive decision on the federal Canada track could have simplified and reduced Bilcon's challenges in other ways. In some scenarios, Bilcon might have successfully sought judicial review to achieve success on the Nova Scotia track, and thereby achieved the overall ability to proceed with its project.\n\n582.\n\nIndeed, even if the JRP had recommended against the project under both federal Canada and Nova Scotia mandates, a variety of scenarios remained possible whereby the project could still have been authorized. At the federal Canada level, decision makers could have decided to disagree with the JRP recommendation against the project, and approved it. The same could have occurred at the Nova Scotia level. At each level, decision-makers could have decided that conditions, possibly including ones not earlier recommended by the JRP, attached to their approval would ensure that adverse environmental impacts would now be satisfactorily addressed. At each level, decision-makers could in the alternative have determined that the broad public interest in all the circumstances warranted proceeding even if some significant adverse effects would likely still occur even if all conditions concerning mitigation were observed.\n\n583.\n\nWith respect to Bilcon's application, however, the decision-makers at both levels were hampered in carrying out their mandate by the fact that the JRP did not provide the comprehensive investigation, information-gathering and analysis, including identification of feasible mitigation measures, contemplated under the *CEAA*. Instead, among other deficits, the JRP made the deliberate decision not to identify mitigation measures\u2014many of which, it acknowledged, were actually possible. The JRP was so convinced, on the basis of its own \"community core values\" approach, that the project was unacceptable that it did not want to provide ideas that the governmental decision-makers might incorporate into an ultimate approval. This approach amounted to an unauthorized pre-emption, by the role of a body charged with gathering information and making recommendations, of the discretion of those who were vested with the ultimate authority to decide.\n\n*Did Canada and Nova Scotia fail to give the JRP Report sufficient independent scrutiny, including* *providing Bilcon an opportunity to voice its objections and as governments to provide reasons for* *rejecting Bilcon's application?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the decision-makers in Nova Scotia and federal Canada had the authority and duty to make their own decision about the future of the Bilcon project. If they had considered the methodology report flawed, they could have sent it back to the JRP for clarification or further work. They could have provided for different or additional mitigation provisions. They could have agreed that the project likely had significant adverse effects after mitigation, but still approved it on public interest considerations in all the circumstances. Both Nova Scotia and then federal Canada, however, accepted the conclusion of the JRP that the project likely would have significant adverse effects on \"community core values\" and rejected it.\n\n585.\n\nBilcon asked for the opportunity to meet with the Ministers of Nova Scotia and federal Canada to explain their objections. In both cases, Bilcon' request was refused. The Tribunal can readily understand that an in-person meeting might be considered objectionable, inasmuch as it would potentially follow up a public hearing process with one which was less transparent and which might in practice exclude many stakeholders who would also want to directly speak to the ultimate decision-makers. The Tribunal agrees, however, with the evidence of Mr. Rankin that the decision-makers did have a duty to give Bilcon an opportunity to voice its objection to the JRP's Report, even if the format was a written submission. The fact of the matter is that Bilcon did send a concise outline of its objections, including its comments and objections on \"community core values\", to the responsible Nova Scotia Minister, and included that correspondence in its communications with the federal Canada Minister.789 The Nova Scotia Minister stated that he had reviewed the submissions from Bilcon \"very, very carefully\".790\n\nSecond Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 223, referring at n.337 to Bilcon Letter to The Honourable John Baird, dated 21 November 2007, Bilcon Letter to The Honourable Mark Parent, dated 8 November 2007, Bilcon Letter to The Honourable Mark Parent, dated 16 November 2007 and Fax Cover Sheet and Transmission Verification Report, dated 28 November 2007 (Exhibit C-204).\n\nSecond Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 223, referring to Transcript of telephone conversation between Paul Buxton and Mark Parent, dated 20 November 2007, Exhibit R-560.\n\n586.\n\nThe federal Canada official response states that the JRP Report was carefully considered by officials of Fisheries and Oceans and Transport Canada.791 There does not appear to be a comparable statement to that of the Nova Scotia Minister to the effect that the competent authorities actually considered the Investors' criticisms of the JRP Report. At the same time, there is no affirmative evidence that federal Canada failed to consider the written submission of Bilcon that was passed on to it by Nova Scotia. While there are grounds for concern, supported by both the Estrin and Rankin expert reports, that federal Canada did not open its mind to at least considering that the methodology of the JRP was mistaken, in the end, the Tribunal is not convinced that it has a sufficient basis in evidence to arrive at a definitive finding adverse to Canada in this respect.\n\nThe Government of Canada's Response to the Environmental Assessment Report of the Joint Review Panel on the Whites Point Quarry and Marine Terminal Project, issued on 17 December 2007, quoted in Memorial, para. 281, cited in First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 535.\n\n587.\n\nThe common law version of public administrative law in Canada, and a specific statutory requirement under the *NSEA*, require that decision-makers provide reasons for their decisions. Neither Canada nor Nova Scotia provided detailed explanations for their adoption of the recommendations of the JRP. It is clear, however, that both adopted the essential finding of the JRP, which on its part had provided a lengthy explanation of its findings and analysis. In all the circumstances, the Tribunal does not find that there was a failure to provide reasons that constitutes a breach of the international minimum standard. There was on the public record an explanation by federal Canada and Nova Scotia which gave the Investors a basic appreciation of the foundation of the decisions made.\n\n**(d) Conclusions Regarding the International Minimum Standard**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal has referred to the *Waste Management* epitome of the minimum standard, and will now specifically apply it to the facts of this case.\n\n589.\n\nThe *Waste Management* standard calls for a consideration of representations made by the host state which an investor relied on to its detriment. What is needed are specific representations, rather than abstract references to the general legal framework in relation to an investment or general statements about the attractiveness of an investment destination. In the present case, they were very clear, repeated encouragements by authorities of Nova Scotia that Bilcon was welcome to pursue its coastal quarry and marine terminal project, including at the specific Whites Point location. All the relevant encouragement was in the context of Bilcon being required to present a project that would comply with federal and provincial laws concerning the environment. There was no indication in either the encouragements from government or in the laws themselves that the Whites Point area was a \"no go\" zone for projects of the kind Bilcon was pursuing, regardless of their individual environmental merits, carefully and methodically assessed.\n\n590.\n\nThe *Waste Management* standard calls for a consideration of procedural as well as substantive fairness. Bilcon was denied a fair opportunity to know the case it had to meet. It had no reason to expect, under the law or any notice provided by the JRP, that \"community core values\" would be an overriding factor; that this factor would pre-empt a thorough \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" analysis of the whole range of project effects; and that this factor would contain elements that would effectively preclude any real possibility that an application could succeed, even if Bilcon showed in each and every respect mentioned in the EIS Guidelines that the project would, after mitigation, likely have no significant adverse effects on environmental, social and economic conditions. Bilcon in fact submitted extensive expert evidence to address the issues raised in the EIS Guidelines, including social effects. Bilcon could not be faulted for failing in its initial submissions to anticipate the unprecedented approach that the JRP articulated in its final report. As for the JRP hearings themselves, the Tribunal has noted the relative lack of interest displayed by the JRP in hearing from the experts Bilcon had assembled\u2014devoting to Bilcon's experts only 90 minutes out of 90 hours of the hearing (less than 2 percent of the total hearing time).\n\n591.\n\nThe *Waste Management* test mentions arbitrariness. The Tribunal finds that the conduct of the joint review was arbitrary. The JRP effectively created, without legal authority or fair notice to Bilcon, a new standard of assessment rather than fully carrying out the mandate defined by the applicable law, including the requirement under the *CEAA* to carry out a thorough \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" analysis.\n\n592.\n\nViewing the actions of Canada as a whole, it was unjust for officials to encourage coastal mining projects in general and specifically encourage the pursuit of the project at the Whites Point site, and then, after a massive expenditure of effort and resources by Bilcon on that basis, have other officials effectively determine that the area was a \"no go\" zone for this kind of development rather than carrying out the lawfully prescribed evaluation of its individual environmental merits.\n\n593.\n\nCanada is one entity for the purposes of NAFTA responsibility. There is a saying that sometimes \"the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing\". For the purposes of state responsibility the combined impact of its left hand and right hand can be determinative even if the actions of either in isolation do not rise to the level of a breach. In this case there were opportunities for federal Canada to harmonize its deliberations. Federal Canada as well as Nova Scotia were able to provide input to the JRP. Both had the later opportunity to address its problematic aspects of the JRP Report.\n\n594.\n\nThe *Waste Management* standard involves a high threshold before conduct will be considered as rising to the level of international responsibility under NAFTA. From the Tribunal's perspective, mere error in legal or factual analysis, is by no means sufficient to rise to that threshold. However, the Tribunal considers the breach here to rise to that threshold, in light of: the Investors' reasonable expectations and major consequent investment of resources and reputation in a process that is the most rigorous, public and extensive kind provided under the laws of Canada; the fact that the JRP's distinctive approach in adopting the concept of community core values was not proceeded by reasonable notice; and the fact that the approach of the JRP departed in fundamental ways from the standard of evaluation required by the laws of Canada rather than merely being controversial in matters of detailed application.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this case involves environmental regulation, and that there is substantial concern among the public and state authorities that investor-state treaty provisions not be used as obstacles to the maintenance and implementation of high standards of protection of environmental integrity. The Tribunal therefore wishes to make several points very clear.\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the statement in the Preamble of NAFTA according to which the Parties are resolved to \"ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment\", but the same Preamble also refers to a resolve to \"strengthen the development and enforcement of environmental law\". NAFTA places no inherent limits on how demanding the standards of a domestic statute may be. The concepts of promoting both economic development and environmental integrity are integrated into the Preamble's endorsement of the principle of sustainable development.\n\n597.\n\nEnvironmental regulations, including assessments, will inevitably be of great relevance for many kinds of major investments in modern times. The mere fact that environmental regulation is involved does not make investor protection inapplicable. Were such an approach to be adopted\u2014and States Parties could have chosen to do so\u2014there would be a very major gap in the scope of the protection given to investors. The Laws of Canada and Nova Scotia, as well as the NAFTA itself, expressly acknowledge that economic development and environmental integrity can not only be reconciled, but can be mutually reinforcing.\n\n598.\n\nIn arriving at its conclusion in this case, the Tribunal is not suggesting that there is the slightest issue with the level of protection for the environment provided in the laws of Canada and Nova Scotia. Each is free under NAFTA to adopt laws that are as demanding as they choose in exercising their sovereign authority. Canada and Nova Scotia have both adopted high standards. There can be absolutely no issue with that under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA. The Tribunal's concern is actually that the rigorous and comprehensive evaluation defined and prescribed by the laws of Canada was not in fact carried out.\n\n599.\n\nIt was open under NAFTA for legislatures to adopt different environmental assessment standards and processes than they had in place at the time of the Bilcon Project. Nova Scotia lawmakers could, for example, have provided that local governments must approve the project or that it could not proceed without support in a local referendum. Federal Canada could by legislation have relaxed its requirement that to be assessable, an effect must have a biophysical pathway.\n\n600.\n\nThe problem in this case is whether the Investors' application was assessed in a manner that complied with the laws that Canada and Nova Scotia actually chose to adopt. The Tribunal has considered all the evidence from participants and experts on both sides, and concluded, based on the reports of two highly experienced and respected experts in Canadian environmental law that there was in fact a fundamental departure from the methodology required by Canadian and Nova Scotia law.\n\n601.\n\nThe Tribunal would further reiterate that under the laws of Canada and Nova Scotia, social impacts can be within the scope of a valid assessment. Furthermore, the value placed by members of a community on distinctive components of an ecosystem can be taken into account in an assessment under the laws of Canada and Nova Scotia. The Tribunal has respectfully taken issue with only the distinct, unprecedented and unexpected approach taken by the JRP to \"community core values\" in this particular case.\n\n602.\n\nThis Tribunal also wishes to be very clear that it has not purported in these reasons to conduct its own environmental assessment, in substitution for that of the JRP. The Tribunal at this stage simply holds that the applicant was not treated in a manner consistent with Canada's own laws, including the core evaluative standard under the *CEAA* and the standards of fair notice required by Canadian public administrative law. The Tribunal is not here deciding what the actual outcome should have been, including what mitigation measures should have been prescribed if the JRP had carried out the mandate contained in applicable laws.\n\n603.\n\nThe Investors' position is that, properly considered, their application would have led to a project that would have promoted the economic and social vitality of a local community; that would have helped to diversify the economy at a time when some traditional industries were suffering; and that it was designed to be carried out in a manner that would not be deleterious in areas such as human safety, the protection of animal and plant life, the continuation of traditional economic activities and the aesthetics of the area. The basis of liability under Chapter Eleven is that, after all the specific encouragement the Investors and their investment had received from government to pursue the project, and after all the resources placed in preparing and presenting their environmental assessment case, the Investors and their investment were not afforded a fair *opportunity* to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided in accordance with applicable laws.\n\n604.\n\nFor the reasons given, the Tribunal concludes that the approach to the environmental assessment taken by the JRP and adopted by Canada resulted in a breach of Article 1105.\n\n**B. NAFTA ARTICLE 1102 (NATIONAL TREATMENT) AND ARTICLE 1103 (MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nThe Investors argue that an investor of another NAFTA party is entitled to claim the benefit of the best standard of treatment afforded to a Party's own nationals under NAFTA Article 1102, as well as that afforded to another Party or a non-Party under Article 1103.792\n\nReply, para. 419.\n\n606.\n\nIn the Investors' view, the non-discrimination obligations set out in Articles 1102 and 1103 contain parallel elements which impose a similar analytical approach. The inclusion of certain phrases common to both Articles suggests, according to the Investors, that the interpretation of both articles requires a comparison between different treatment and between the two \"circumstances\", the comparators, to which different treatment is accorded. Moreover, in the Investors' view, they are entitled to the benefit of the \"better treatment\" by virtue of NAFTA Article 1104 without having to allege and prove breach under Articles 1102 and 1103.793 Despite the similarities in language, as the Tribunal sets out below, the Investors make distinct arguments about Article 1102 and Article 1103\n\nReply, para. 420; Canada's Statement of Implementation, p. 149, Exhibit CA-45.\n\n**(a) The Interpretation of NAFTA Article 1102**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nThe Investors submit that GATT/WTO experience with national treatment is useful to the Tribunal's interpretation of the content and scope of NAFTA Article 1102.794 The Investors argue that a successful claim based on Article 1102 must satisfy the following three elements: first, the Respondent \"must accord foreign investors and/or their investments treatment that is \u2018no less favorable' than that which it accords to its own investors and investments\".795 Secondly, \"the differential treatment must be accorded with respect to investors and/or investments \u2018in like circumstances'\".796 Thirdly, \"the differential treatment\" must be extended to \"the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments\".797 In the Investors' view, the analysis begins with an evaluation of like circumstances.798\n\nReply, para. 262. *See also* Reply, paras. 255-261.\n\nReply, para. 264.\n\nReply, para. 264.\n\nReply, para. 264.\n\nReply, para. 265, referring to Memorial, para. 373.\n\ni. Like Circumstances\n---------------------\n\n608.\n\nIt is the Investors' position that the element of like circumstances requires a comparison between the Investor and domestic investors engaged in similar economic activities and/or regulated by the same general legal framework.799 When carrying out the likeness analysis under NAFTA Article 1102, the Investors suggest that the analysis should focus on the competitive relationship between investors.800 This element does not, in the Investors' view, require \"identical\" or \"most like\" circumstances.801\n\nReply, para. 271. *See also* Reply, paras. 272-291.\n\nReply, para. 297. *See also* Reply, paras. 331-350.\n\nReply, paras. 292-297.\n\n609.\n\nThe Investors contend that, because of the shared federal-provincial jurisdiction over the EA in Canada,802 the comparators for the purpose of like circumstances are the general class of applicants applying for consideration under the EA scheme. All applicants come before the governmental authorities in similar situations seeking the same treatment, and in relation to this treatment, must be considered to be in like circumstances.803\n\nReply, para. 353; *The Constitution Act*, 1867, s. 92A, Exhibit CA-217; Expert Report of Murray Rankin, paras. 46, 49; Rejoinder, para. 166.\n\nReply, para. 357; *Occidental v.

Less Favorable Treatment\n----------------------------\n\n610.\n\nThe Investors submit that, under the \"less favorable treatment\" protection, \"a party cannot modify the \u2018competitive opportunities' to the detriment of another parties' investors and its investments\".804 According to the Investors, this is an objective test. The Investors further maintain that differences in treatment between firms in the same economic sector shift the burden to the respondents to show that the treatment is no less favorable.805\n\nReply, para. 361. *See also* Memorial, paras. 415-426.\n\nReply, para. 324; Appellate Body Report in EC-Asbestos, Exhibit CA-50; Appellate Body Report in US-Cloves Cigarettes, Exhibit CA-196.\n\n611.\n\nThe Investors reject the Respondent's argument that in order to establish a breach of NAFTA, what is required is a showing of discriminatory intent based on nationality.806 NAFTA tribunals have not adopted this approach. In any event, the Investors contend that the treatment that was afforded to Bilcon \"establish[es] a strong presumption of nationality-based discrimination\".807\n\nReply, paras. 369-376.\n\nReply, para. 388.\n\n612.\n\nThe Investors rely also on NAFTA Article 201(1) to argue that the Agreement takes a very broad view of what qualifies as a measure.808 According to the Investors, \"[d]uration **[** of the environmental assessment process **]** is clearly a measure and this constitutes a form of treatment to the Investors and their Investment\".809\n\nReply, para. 395.\n\nReply, para. 397; *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

The Establishment, Acquisition,... or other Disposition of Investments\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n613.\n\nWith regard to the third element\u2014the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments\u2014the Investors argue that \"[i]n the context of environmental regulatory measures, the aspects of an investment affected by NAFTA Article 1103 would by definition have to address the establishment, expansion, conduct or operation of economic activity proposed by the investor\".810 The Investors further submit that the treatment in question concerned the operation of the investment.811\n\nReply, para. 409.\n\nReply, para. 363.\n\n**(b) The Alleged Breach of NAFTA Article 1102**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nThe Investors argue that all proponents and their projects seeking regulatory approval under Canada's environmental assessment scheme are in like circumstances with the Investors and the Whites Point project.812 The Investors further submit that some Canadian investors received better treatment in other EAs. In particular, the Investors suggest that Canadian-owned projects and Canadian investors received better treatment in respect of the assessment of cumulative effects, the precautionary principle, adaptive management and mitigation measures, information requests, blasting and the scoping and level of EAs.813 The Investors maintain that, as a result of the Respondent's failure to meet its national treatment obligation, they and their investment have been harmed.814\n\nReply, para. 576; Memorial, paras. 538-545.\n\nReply, para. 577.\n\nMemorial, para. 603; Witness Statement of William Richard Clayton, paras. 31-33.\n\ni. Cumulative Effects\n---------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Investors submit that EAs in Canada must factor in the cumulative environmental effects of other projects that have been or will be carried out.815 According to the Investors, \"the imposition of a more stringent, and incorrect, cumulative effects standard compared to other projects going through the same regulatory process constitutes less favorable treatment\".816\n\nReply, para. 578 (citing First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 423).\n\nReply, para. 580.\n\n616.\n\nThe Investors submit that the JRP for the Whites Point project applied an \"incorrect and prejudicial standard\", which led the JRP to view the Investors' cumulative effects assessment as inadequate.817 The Investors maintain that, in contrast to their treatment by the JRP, the cumulative effects standard that was applied in the EAs of the projects at Voisey's Bay, Eider Rock LNG, Deltaport Third Berth Project, and Belleoram Coastal Quarry was the appropriate standard under Canadian law, not requiring any speculation about future, speculative projects.818\n\nReply, para. 580.\n\nReply, para. 582.

Precautionary Principle\n---------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe Investors argue that the Whites Point project was also not afforded like treatment in the application of the precautionary principle because, in contrast to the Voisey's Bay and Sable Gas projects, the JRP in the Whites Point project applied \"a definition of the precautionary principle that failed to recognize the absence of full-scientific certainty\".819 The Investors further contend that while the Whites Point Quarry was subject to the same legislative regime as several other pre-2003 projects for which a precautionary principle was not employed, the precautionary principle was applied for the Whites Point project EA.820\n\nReply, para. 589. *See also* paras. 588-592. *See also* Memorial, para. 577 (regarding the precautionary principle and the Voisey's Bay project) and para. 684 (for general description of the Sable Gas project).\n\nMemorial, para. 557. *See also* para. 556 (for description of the Aguathuna Quarry project).\n\niii. Mitigation Measures and Contingent Approval\n------------------------------------------------\n\n618.\n\nThe Investors object to the JRP's consideration, or lack thereof, of their proposed mitigation measures. For one, it is the Investors' view that, in contrast to the treatment afforded to the projects of Canadian companies,821 the JRP in Bilcon's case did not view adaptive management as an effective mitigation tool and dismissed it in the assessment process.822 The Investors maintain that their presentation of adaptive management for mitigation purposes should have been considered as in those Canadian cases.\n\nReply, paras. 596-599.\n\nReply, para. 600; JRP Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, dated 16 June 2007, p. 120, Exhibit C-154.\n\n619.\n\nAccording to the Investors, the Canadian proponents for Lower Churchill, Keltic, Rabaska and Kemess received better treatment than the Investors in the course of their review processes because each of those panels considered mitigation measures before making a determination on significant adverse environmental effects, unlike the Whites Point JRP.823 In particular, the Investors state that despite the fact that the Kemess JRP recommended outright rejection of that project, the panel identified 32 mitigation measures in the event that the project was approved.824 Likewise, the Deltaport Third Berth project's comprehensive study report benefited from mitigation measures.825\n\nReply. para. 614. *See also* paras. 601-613. *See also* Memorial, paras. 570-572 (for discussion regarding the Keltic Project).\n\nReply, para. 602; Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 292.\n\nReply, para. 603. *See also* Memorial, para. 563.\n\niv. Information Requests\n------------------------\n\n620.\n\nThe Investors submit that they were subject to \"unreasonable, arbitrary and highly burdensome information requests\" after the submission of their EIS,826 in contrast to the treatment afforded to the GSX Pipeline project where a JRP ruled out unduly burdensome information requests submitted by the public.\n\nReply, para. 615; Letter from Robert Fournier to Paul Buxton, dated 28 June 2006, Exhibit C-150.\n\nv. Blasting\n-----------\n\n621.\n\nAccording to the Investors, they were prevented from carrying out test blasts that would have assisted their presentation to the JRP due to the imposition of unachievable and inappropriate Blasting Conditions set by the DFO, as well as the DFO's subsequent refusal to provide information regarding blasting setback calculations\".827 Based on the figures showing the blasting charge and minimum setback of the Whites Point project as compared to those for Tiverton Harbour, Tiverton Quarry and Belleoram, the Investors conclude that proponents for those projects received better treatment than the Investors did with regards to blasting.828\n\nReply, para. 618.\n\nReply, para. 619. *See also* Memorial, paras. 547-550 (for more details on Tiverton Quarry), paras. 553-555 (for more details on Tiverton Harbour), paras. 559-560 (for more details on Belleoram).\n\n622.\n\nIn particular, the Investors refer to Tiverton Harbour, which is owned by a Canadian government agency, and is located 10 km away from the Whites Point Quarry on the same body of water. The Investors submit that, since the blasting at Tiverton Harbour was in the water, there was far greater potential for disruption and destruction of fish and fish habitat than at the Whites Point Quarry.829 Nevertheless, despite the fact that iBoF salmon was already raised as an issue in the assessment of the Whites Point Quarry in May 2003, the Tiverton Harbour habitat study that the DFO conducted in September 2003 did not mention iBoF salmon. Only in October 2003, as a result of questions Bilcon raised, did the DFO engage in a consideration of iBoF salmon in relation to Tiverton.830 The Investors argue that despite concerns regarding the negative effects of this project on oceanography raised by the DFO,831 the project received HADD authorization just one month later due to, according to the Investors, inappropriate intervention by DFO's Habitat Management Division in the drafting of the Tiverton Screening Report.832\n\nReply, para. 621; Expert Report of Murray Rankin, paras. 83-84.\n\nReply, paras. 622-623; Letter from Phil Zamora to Paul Buxton, dated 29 May 2003, Exhibit C-687. *See also* Memorial, para. 555.\n\nReply, para. 624; Fax from Faith Scattolon to Neil Bellefontaine, and Briefing Note, dated 7 January 2004, Exhibit C-692.\n\nReply, paras. 625-626.\n\n623.\n\nThe Investors submit that the preferential treatment afforded to Tiverton Harbour and its proponent, a Nova Scotia company, also included the restrictions in respect of effects of blasting on whales.833 In Tiverton Harbour, DFO's Science Sector provided a one-page memo regarding the effects of blasting at Tiverton on marine mammals,834 while for the Whites Point project, DFO-Science produced a 17-page report. Moreover, the Investors submit that at Tiverton, the \"blasting, not just to build an access road, was allowed to occur even before an actual [a]pproval had been given\".835\n\nReply, para. 627.

Scoping\n-----------\n\n627.\n\nThe Investors submit that the Canadian proponents for the Tiverton Quarry, Belleoram, Bear Head LNG, and Keltic projects also received better treatment than the Investors in respect of the scope of their assessments. For those projects, DFO did not scope in the land-based aspects of these projects, resulting in a far less onerous environmental assessment process, according to the Investors.844\n\nReply, para. 651. *See also* paras. 652-662. *See also* Memorial, para. 551 (regarding Tiverton Quarry) paras. 559-560 (regarding Belleoram), paras. 571-572 (regarding the Keltic project).

Level of Assessment847\n---------------------------\n\nIn the introduction to the arguments on the violation of Article 1102 in the Reply, the Investors do not list this as an independent treatment but as part of scoping (item (g) in para. 577). However, they do refer to it as an independent item (h) in their arguments (*see* title between paras. 662 and 663).\n\n629.\n\nThe Investors point out that the Whites Point project is the only quarry in Nova Scotia \"of the 33 proposed quarries assessed under the 2000 Nova Scotia Environment Act to have been sent to a panel review\".848 In particular, the Investors refer to the Prosperity Gold-Copper Project, proposed by a Canadian company849 and argue that on that occasion the proponent was able to put pressure on provincial and federal regulators to avoid a JRP process.850\n\nReply, para. 664; Second Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 145.\n\nReply, para. 665.\n\nReply, para. 666.\n\nviii. Other Forms of Preferential Treatment\n-------------------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nThe Investors also argue that the following projects received other forms of preferential treatment, such as a shorter and less stringent EA: Tiverton Quarry;851 Tiverton Harbour;852 Aguathuna Quarry;853 the Belleoram Quarry Project;854 the Deltaport Third Berth Project,855 the Bear Head LNG Project;856 the Keltic Project;857and Voisey's Bay.858\n\nMemorial, paras. 551-552.\n\nMemorial, paras. 554-555.\n\nMemorial, paras. 556-557.\n\nMemorial, paras. 559-560.\n\nMemorial, para. 563.\n\nMemorial, paras. 566-569.\n\nMemorial, paras. 571-572.\n\nMemorial, para. 574.\n\n**(c) The Interpretation of NAFTA Article 1103**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nThe Investors submit that a NAFTA Party breaches Article 1103 when it fails to provide equality of competitive opportunities to investors and investments.859\n\nReply, para. 416; United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Most-FavouredNation Treatment, UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements 1999, p. 8, Exhibit CA-238.\n\n632.\n\nThe Investors submit that the likeness tests under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 differ:\n\nNotwithstanding the similar legal elements of NAFTA Article 1102 and 1103, the Investors submitted separate claims to acknowledge that these provisions involve two distinct comparisons that coexist in the NAFTA non-discrimination obligations.860\n\nReply, paras. 422, 424. *See also* Memorial, paras. 374, 434.\n\n633.\n\nIn the Investors' view, despite the similarities between Articles 1102 and 1103, a likeness test under Article 1103 differs from that under Article 1102 in that 1103 requires a comparison between the \"like circumstances\" of investors and their investment and the general class of applicants from any other NAFTA party or non-party.861 The Investors argue that:\n\na meaning of likeness has to be related to the aspect of the economic activity that has been regulated.

The mine faced significant public opposition, but was only assessed by a comprehensive study lasting a little over two years and not a review panel despite various social and environmental concerns.869 It is the Investors' position that the Respondent failed to explain why this project was subject to a comprehensive study, and they submit that the Respondent's explanation that the project site was isolated, lacking an eco-tourism industry, is contrary to the facts.870 Moreover, the Investors reject the Respondent's assertion \"that the post-2003 *CEAA* amendments made a Joint Review Panel unnecessary for the Victor Diamond Mine project\", and argue that \"the Comprehensive Study Report for the Victor Diamond Project expressly notes that the post-2003 *CEAA* amendments did not apply\".871 Lastly, the Investors submit that despite the likelihood of future projects in the area, the comprehensive study of the Victor Diamond Mine only required inclusion of cumulative effects related to known projects, unlike the requirements placed on the Whites Point Project.872\n\nReply, para. 669. *See also* Memorial, para. 622.\n\nReply, para. 672 (citing Counter-Memorial, para. 470).\n\nReply, para. 673.\n\nReply, para. 669 (citing Comprehensive Study Report for Victor Diamond Project, Undated, Exhibit C-803). *See also* Memorial, para. 623; Victor Diamond Project Draft Comprehensive Study Guidelines, dated 17 November 2003, Exhibit C-191.\n\n638.\n\nThe Investors argue that significant industrial activity at the Diavik Diamond project site, a joint venture between a UK mining company and a Canadian mining company,873 was even more pronounced than at the site of the Whites Point project.874 Despite public calls for a review panel, it was nevertheless only subjected to a comprehensive study.875 Likewise, according to the Investors, in contrast to the analysis of cumulative effects of hypothetical projects that the JRP required Bilcon to conduct, the scope of cumulative effects analysis that the Diavik Diamond project needed to provide was limited to \"[a]ll activities in operation up to and including 1996, the year the project was proposed; and.

In further contrast to the Whites Point project, the responsible authority chose to narrowly scope the project to include only the marine terminal and the nearby waterways. Last, the Respondent contends that the cumulative effects in the Sechelt Carbonate project were limited to \"effects that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities that have been or will be carried out\" unlike at Whites Point.891\n\nMemorial, para. 624; About Pan Pacific Aggregates, Exhibit C-584.\n\nMemorial, para. 625; Sechelt Carbonate Project Description, dated 9 June 2006, Exhibit C-337.\n\nMemorial, paras. 625-626.\n\n645.\n\nAccording to the Investors, the Southern Head project included investors of different nationalities and origins, and involved the construction and operation of a refinery and marine terminal.892 The Investors submit that the assessment of the Southern Head project took less than 19 months, was limited to the marine terminal, and was conducted as a comprehensive study.893 The Investors also argue that the Responsible Authority for the Southern Head project relied upon the applicable exemption in s. 28(c) of the *Comprehensive Study List Regulations* to remove the processing facilities from the scope of the comprehensive study, while the Whites Point Quarry was not afforded the same exemption.894\n\nMemorial, para. 618; Project Registration for Newfoundland & Labrador Refinery Project at Southern Head at the Head of Placentia Bay, NL, dated 16 October 2006, Exhibit C-332. *See also* Memorial, para. 617.\n\nMemorial, para. 618.\n\nMemorial, para. 618.\n\n646.\n\nWith regard to cumulative effects, the Investors submit that the analysis of cumulative effects for this project was limited to future projects that met specific conditions.895 The Investors also submit that although consideration of the precautionary principle was required according to the *CEAA*, the principle was not mentioned in the comprehensive study of the Southern Head project.896\n\nMemorial, para. 619; Comprehensive Study Report for the Southern Head Marine Terminal, dated 27 September 2007, p. 187, Exhibit C-336. *See also* Memorial, para. 620.\n\nMemorial, para. 621; Comprehensive Study Report for the Southern Head Marine Terminal, dated 27 September 2007, Exhibit C-336.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n647.\n\nThe Respondent analyzes NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 jointly as, in its view, Article 1103 prescribes a similar obligation to the one prescribed in Article 1102 but on a most-favored-nation basis.897 The Respondent asserts that, for the Investors to be successful on their Article 1102 and 1103 claims, they must demonstrate that:\n\n(1) a government accorded them \"treatment\" during the EA of the Whites Point project and that the same government accorded treatment to other domestic or foreign investors or investments; (2) the treatment this government accorded to the Claimants or their investment was \"less favourable\" than that which it accorded to these other domestic or foreign EA proponents; and (3) the government accorded the allegedly discriminatory treatment in question \"in like circumstances\".898\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 398-399.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 192-93.\n\n648.\n\nThe Respondent adds that this analysis has to be conducted in light of the object and purpose of Articles 1102 and 1103, which is to prevent discriminatory treatment based on the nationality of an investor or its investment.899\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 400-401.\n\n**(a) Treatment**\n-----------------\n\n649.\n\nThe Respondent relies on *Merrill & Ring* in support of the proposition that \"treatment accorded to foreign investors by the national government needs to be compared to that accorded by the same government to domestic investors... just as the treatment accorded by a province ought to be compared to the treatment of that province in respect of like investments\".900 The Respondent contends that the same logic applies when treatment is accorded concurrently by two jurisdictions.901 The Respondent further submits that one cannot compare EAs conducted on behalf of different state entities. For the same reasons, the Respondent rejects the Investors' comparison of the JRP's approach to conducting the EA under terms of reference based on federal and Nova Scotia law, with the approach employed by government authorities or review panels operating in or under different provincial jurisdictions.902\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v.

This requirement has two elements that the Investors must prove, according to the Respondent:903 First, they must show that the treatment they were accorded was, in fact, less favorable than that accorded to domestic investors. Secondly, the Investors must show that the less favorable treatment was accorded to them on the basis of their nationality.904 According to the Respondent, the second element requires objective evidence that the Investors have been discriminated against by reason of nationality.905\n\nRejoinder, para. 169.\n\nRejoinder, para. 170.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 191, lines 4-12, citing the *Loewen* and *Feldman* cases.\n\n651.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Investors' assertion that duration of the process constitutes treatment that can cause a breach of NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103.906 According to the Respondent, \"it is the \u2018acts' of a State during a regulatory process, not the amount of time the process takes, that constitute \u2018treatment' under NAFTA\".907\n\nRejoinder, para. 163.\n\nRejoinder, para. 163.\n\n**(b) Less Favorable**\n----------------------\n\n652.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors have failed to demonstrate any difference in the way they were treated as compared to the treatment accorded to other EAs. It is the Respondent's position that even if or where the Investors have identified different treatment, they have failed to show that the different treatment was less favorable.908\n\nRejoinder, paras. 172 and 174.\n\n**(c) Nationality-Based Discrimination**\n----------------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, even if the Investors were to demonstrate that the treatment they were accorded was objectively less favorable than that accorded to other domestic or foreign investors, they have failed to demonstrate that they were accorded this treatment because of their nationality as required by Articles 1102 and 1103.909 The Respondent rejects the Investors' interpretation of Articles 1102 and 1103 that, it argues, require the contracting parties to provide the \"\u2018best' treatment, i.e. treatment no less favorable than every single domestic investor\".910\n\nRejoinder, para. 178. *See also* Counter-Memorial, paras. 417-420.\n\nRejoinder, para. 179, referring to Reply, paras. 367-368.\n\n**(d) In Like Circumstances**\n-----------------------------\n\n654.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Investors fail to demonstrate the treatment they challenge was accorded \"in like circumstances\" to the treatment accorded to other EA proponents. Specifically, the Respondent submits that the Investors' analysis is conducted irrespective of the specific factors at play in the EA process for the other projects. According to the Respondent, the Investors' analysis also \"ignores how the quality of the information and evidence a proponent supplies can affect the administration of the EA process\".911\n\nRejoinder, paras. 181-182.\n\n655.\n\nThe Respondent clarifies that, in its view, \"in like circumstances\" does not require identical or most like circumstance.912 Rather, \"it is the circumstances *underlying* the way in which Canada treats two investors that are determinative of whether or not treatment was accorded in like circumstances... including consideration of a State's policy objectives in according the treatment in question\".913 The Respondent elaborates that \"treatment needs to be compared to that accorded by the same government to domestic investors.\"914 No NAFTA tribunal has found to the contrary.\n\nRejoinder, para. 185.\n\nRejoinder, para. 185 (emphasis in the original). *See also* Rejoinder, paras. 186-187.\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, p. 196, lines 7-15.\n\n**(e) The Treatment in the EA Processes Identified by the Investors Was Not Accorded in Like Circumstances**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n656.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Investors fail to show that any of the alleged instances of treatment in the Whites Point EA were accorded in like circumstances to those accorded in the comparator EAs.915 It is the Respondent's position that decisions taken in the EA process are based upon the professional judgment of officials and experts, as informed by the unique facts of each case, and as long as they are rational, in light of these facts, they are not to be second-guessed by a NAFTA tribunal.916\n\nRejoinder, para. 192; Counter-Memorial, paras. 432.\n\nRejoinder, para. 192. *See also* paras. 193-214.\n\n657.\n\nThe Respondent also takes issue with the Investors' characterization of the Whites Point EA which it contends is misleading. For example, where the Investors complain of an inability to carry out test blasting, the Respondent notes that they never made any request to the JRP to do so.917 These misleading allegations further detract from any comparisons the Investors attempt to carry out.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 132. *See also* paras. 99, 112-113.\n\n658.\n\nIn respect of the marine terminal at the Bear Head project, the Respondent submits that this marine terminal required only a screening assessment because the Bear Head site had been zoned \"Port Industrial\", suitable for \"fuel bunkering, marine terminals and other heavy industrial or port activities as required\" in a municipal planning strategy. According to the Respondent, the zoning statutorily exempted the marine terminal at that site from an EA as a \"comprehensive study\" pursuant to the *Comprehensive Study List Regulations*, whereas the Whites Point project could not, as a matter of law, be granted the same exemption.918 Furthermore, the Respondent argues that \"[i]n light of the nature of the surrounding environment, the type of activity involved, and the lack of public opposition, there was no need to elevate the EA of the Bear Head project from a screening to a review panel\".919\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 434.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 435. *See also* Counter-Memorial, paras. 436-437.\n\n659.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it was not necessary to refer the Keltic LNG Terminal project to a review panel because of the industrialized setting of the proposed project, the more minimal impacts of a liquid natural gas terminal, and the lack of public opposition.920 The Respondent asserts that to the extent there was public concern, an EA by way of a comprehensive study in the post-amendment era provided an effective forum for addressing public concerns. The October 2003 amendments did not apply to the Whites Point EA, and thus, in contrast to the situation with Keltic, the best way to ensure effective public participation there was, in the Respondent's view, an assessment by a review panel.921\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 440.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 441.\n\n660.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the site proposed for the Surface Gold Mine922 was located far inland from the coast of Nova Scotia. As a result, DFO scientists determined that the proposed project would not require any *Fisheries Act* authorizations. Thus, unlike the Investors' project, there was no federal jurisdiction over the Surface Gold project, and it could not be referred to a joint federal-provincial review panel.923\n\nAlso referred to as the Torquoy Gold Project.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 443; Letter from Mark McLean to Sue Belford, dated 7 March 2008, Exhibit R-347.\n\n661.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the proposed site for the Surface Gold Mine project was a historical site for gold mining. Moreover, the project was operationally quite limited. The open pit mine was to be operational for just 5 to 7 years (not 50 years like Whites Point), and it was not reliant on marine transportation.924 Finally, the Respondent argues that the project received \"broad public support\".925\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 444.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 445.\n\n662.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's view on the Tiverton project, Nova Scotia did not have jurisdiction to require an EA since the Tiverton Quarry was less than 4 ha in size and \"did not qualify as either a Class I or Class II undertaking pursuant to the Nova Scotia *Environmental Assessment Regulations* \".926 The Respondent further submits that there was no federal jurisdiction over the project that would have allowed an EA under the *CEAA*. The blasting at the Tiverton site was infrequent and occurred no closer than 400 meters from the Bay of Fundy. As a result, DFO scientists determined that the blasting would not require the *Fisheries Act* authorizations.927\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 446.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 447.\n\n663.\n\nThe Respondent highlights several differences between the Nova Stone and Tiverton projects and argues that these differences explain \"the initial blasting conditions to which Nova Stone and the Tiverton Quarry proponent were subjected when they received their industrial approvals\".928 These differences also explain why the Investors' request that the conditional approval issued to Nova Stone should \"be amended to reflect the terms and conditions of the nearby Tiverton Quarry was never granted\", according to the Respondent.929 In contrast to the Whites Point project, the Respondent submits that the Tiverton Quarry never engaged a concern with regard to iBoF salmon and was not in like circumstances.930 But in any event, once iBoF salmon became an issue for DFO at Whites Point, no blasting took place before DFO conducted a review of the blasting design and setback distances at the Tiverton Quarry and determined that there would be no adverse impacts on iBoF salmon or other endangered species.931\n\nRejoinder, para. 207. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 206.\n\nRejoinder, para. 207 (citing Reply, para. 84).\n\nRejoinder, para. 204, n.382.\n\nRejoinder, para. 209.\n\n664.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that since Tiverton Quarry was not subject to an EA, blasting on Tiverton Quarry was only subject to consent of the local residents. The Respondent maintains that, in contrast to the Whites Point project, there was no public opposition to Tiverton Quarry and the proponent obtained the required consent of the local residents.932 In short, Tiverton received the same treatment as Whites Point, but a different outcome was reached.933\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 448.\n\nHearing Transcript, 25 October 2013, p. 261; Hearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 212-213.\n\n665.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was reasonable to assess the Tiverton Harbour as a screening due to limited potential environmental effects from this harbour and the fact that there were no public concerns or opposition to the project.934 The Respondent also submits that the Tiverton Harbour blasting plan, which included blasting under water, was subject to several mitigation measures to address potential impacts to iBoF Atlantic salmon and North Atlantic Right Whales. The primary mitigation measure was that no blasting would take place between July and late December, which is the period during which these species could be present in the area. A similar mitigation measure could not be applied to the proposed Whites Point project, as it required consistent and large-scale blasting adjacent to the Bay of Fundy every two weeks in order to maintain a steady supply of rock for a project scheduled to operate over 50 years.935\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 450-452.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 451.\n\n666.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a separate federal EA of the marine terminal was completed for the Eider Rock project because the provincial and federal processes were not harmonized. Because of the marine terminal's size, the federal EA was done as a comprehensive study\".936 The Respondent argues that Investors have not proven that they were accorded less favorable treatment as compared to Eider Rock because they refer only to the analysis of cumulative effects which did not affect the outcome in the Whites Point project.937\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 453; Eider Rock Comprehensive Study Report, September 2009, pp. 7-10, Exhibit R-364.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 454.\n\n667.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the EA in respect of the Voisey's Bay project resembled the EA for the Whites Point project, and if anything, was more burdensome. That JRP followed nearly the same process as did the Whites Point JRP, including: the issuance of draft EIS Guidelines, the holding of scoping meetings, the issuance of final EIS Guidelines, the submission of an EIS by the proponent, a period of time during which the public could review and comment on the EIS, an information request phase, an additional period of time to review responses to information requests, and a public hearing.\n\n668.\n\nAs a second point, according to the Respondent, scoping meetings for Voisey's Bay were more extensive than in the Whites Point EA as they were held over 17 days at 10 different locations. Thirdly, the Voisey's Bay public hearings were held over 32 days at 11 different locations, and the panel reviewed the project's anticipated effects on a wide range of socio-economic factors such as \"aboriginal land use\", \"employment and business\", and \"family and community life, and public services\". The Respondent maintains that these details indicate that Voisey's Bay did not receive more favorable \"scope and level of assessment\" treatment.938\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 456-457.\n\n669.\n\nIn respect of the Aguathuna Quarry and Marine Terminal, the Respondent explains that the project was subjected to a screening assessment under the Newfoundland and Labrador's *Environmental Protection Act* and related regulations. Newfoundland and Labrador did not take steps to coordinate and harmonize provincial and federal EA processes, and in fact completed its EA prior to federal officials even becoming involved. As a result, a separate federal comprehensive study assessment was conducted. According to the Respondent, like the Whites Point EA, this assessment considered both the quarry and the marine terminal.939\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 458.\n\n670.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Aguathuna project did not warrant a referral to a review panel because the proposed site had already operated as a limestone quarry and shipping facility for a period of more than 50 years (1913-1964);940 the quarrying at Aguathuna was to take place farther back from the water than at Whites Point; the proponent managed to address the major fisheries concern regarding this project;941 and, the Aguathuna project enjoyed public support, which the Respondent claims the Investors admit.942\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 459.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 460.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 461 (citing First Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix F, p. 5).\n\n671.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a separate federal EA was carried out for the Belleoram project because the province did not reach out to the federal government to coordinate processes. The federal EA considered only the marine terminal aspect of the project because, according to the Respondent, scientists at DFO determined that the blasting at the Belleoram quarry would not require the *Fisheries Act* authorizations that were required at Whites Point (*i.e.* an authorization to destroy fish habitat under s. 35(2) and to kill fish by means other than fishing under s. 32).943\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 462.\n\n672.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that there was no reason to refer the assessment of the Belleoram project to a review panel in light of the nature of the area proposed for the project and the lack of public opposition to it.944 Finally, in response to the Investors' complaint of the differences in approach taken to assessing cumulative environmental effects in the Belleoram and Whites Point EAs,945 the Respondent argues that the Investors neglect to acknowledge that *CEAA* policy and practice afford responsible authorities full discretion to consider hypothetical projects in a cumulative effects assessment.946\n\nHearing Transcript, 31 October 2013, pp. 205-206.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 463, n.933 (referring to Memorial, paras. 594-596).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 463, n.933 (referring to First Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, paras. 369-389).\n\n673.\n\nThe Respondent differentiates the projects further, arguing that in the Belleoram Marine Terminal EA, there was no active fishery in the vicinity of the proposed blasting, no evidence that blasting would have an adverse impact upon species at risk such as Right Whales, no local whale watching and ecotourism industry, and an absence of public concern. There was therefore no need for blasting conditions at Belleoram similar to those included in Nova Stone's conditional permit.947\n\nRejoinder, para. 211.\n\n674.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the federal assessment of the Southern Head Oil Refinery and Marine Terminal project was carried out as a comprehensive study and not by a review panel due to the size of the proposed marine terminal;948 the industrial nature of the proposed site (Placentia Bay) of this project;949 the different considerations taken into account when assessing oil refineries;950 and the minimal public opposition.951\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 465.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 465.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 465.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 465.\n\n675.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Deltaport project did not require a review panel despite being located in a busy industrial area and was only an expansion of an existing port facility.952 Secondly, \"unlike the Whites Point project, the Deltaport project did not involve large-scale blasting, extraction and shipment of a resource\".953 Thirdly, while there was some public opposition to this project, the EA addressed all of the substantive comments of the public. Moreover, like the Keltic project, the Deltaport project was subject to the post-October 2003 version of the *CEAA*.

The federal and provincial governments agreed that they would harmonize their respective EAs. Thus, the Respondent states, \"[l]ike the Whites Point EA, this harmonization meant that the entire project, including the mine and the marine terminal, would be included in the EA.\"955\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 468.\n\n677.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that in light of public concern, the proponent made significant revisions including moving the proposed marine terminal from the originally proposed area (Sechelt Inlet) to a location closer to a larger and more industrial area (Georgia Strait).956 According to the Respondent, a comprehensive study would have been required due to the increased size of the relocated marine terminal.957 In June 2007, however, the proponent postponed the project indefinitely.958\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 469.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 469.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 469.\n\n678.\n\nThe Respondent submits that unlike at Whites Point, there were no grounds to refer the assessment of the Victor Diamond Mine to a review panel.959 First, the project was located in an isolated area with no ecotourism.960 Secondly, the Victor Diamond Mine was scheduled to operate for only 12 years, according to the Respondent, as contrasted with the Whites Point's 50 years. Last, there was, according to the Respondent, some public concern, but, as explained above in respect of the Keltic project, \"an EA by way of comprehensive study in this postamendment [of the *CEAA* ] era provided an effective forum for addressing these concerns\".961\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 471.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 471.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 472.\n\n679.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the NWT Diamond Mine received the same treatment as the Investors did.962 Like the Whites Point project, because of the potentially adverse environmental effects and public concern associated with NWT Diamond Mine, it was referred to a review panel.963 This review panel also held a scoping meeting and public hearings during the EA of the project.964\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 474.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 474.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 474.\n\n680.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the Diavik project was referred to a comprehensive study under the *CEAA* because of the construction of an airstrip. By contrast, there was no need to conduct a panel review, largely because such a review had already been completed for the adjacent NWT Diamonds project in June 1996.965 In addition, the Respondent notes that \"the project also had to be considered by the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board before the Minister of the Environment could make a decision on the project. This nine-member Review Board participated in all phases of the *CEAA* -initiated comprehensive study of Diavik\".966\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 476.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 477.\n\n681.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Whites Point and Sable Gas JRPs reached two different conclusions because they had different impacts.967 With regard to the Investors' complaint as to alleged preferential treatment that the North Head Harbour project received, the Respondent maintains that the Investors' project was rejected by the JRP on grounds that were simply not engaged by the North Head Harbour project.968 The Respondent also submits that blasting in the Miller's Creek Gypsum Mine Extension did not give rise to the same concerns as the blasting at Whites Point because it only was an extension of an existing gypsum mine that already occupied 477 ha of land and that had been in operation since the 1950s, far from the Bay.969\n\nRejoinder, para. 195 (citing Second Expert Report of Lawrence Smith, para. 137).\n\nRejoinder, para. 212.\n\nRejoinder, para. 213.\n\n**(f) Additional Arguments on Like Circumstances**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nIn addition to the specific arguments regarding each of the comparators identified by the Investors, the Respondent also submits that the cumulative environmental effects analysis of the Whites Point JRP was entirely consistent with Agency policy, and was based upon specific evidence before the JRP that led it to conclude that the establishment of additional quarries on the Digby Neck was reasonably foreseeable.970 By contrast, the entities responsible for the EA of other projects, such as Victor Diamond Mine, Belleoram Marine and Terminal and the Voisey's Bay, had no such evidence before them.971\n\nRejoinder, para. 196.\n\nRejoinder, para. 197.\n\n683.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Investors' comparison of the JRP's decision not to consider mitigation measures with decisions in other projects ignores \"the relevant legal frameworks of these different JRPs\".972 Unlike the terms of reference of the EA of the Kemess, Prosperity Mine and Lower Churchill projects, the TOR of the Whites Point project did not mandate the JRP to suggest potential mitigation measures in case the JRP concluded that the project should be rejected.973 With regard to the Investors' complaint that unlike in the Whites Point EA, mitigation measures were identified in the Deltaport, Keltic and Rabaska EAs, the Respondent submits that in each of these EAs the recommendation was made that the project should be approved. Had the Whites Point JRP similarly recommended approval, its TOR would have also required it to include mitigation measures with its recommendation.974\n\nRejoinder, para. 198.\n\nRejoinder, para. 198; JRP Agreement, para. 6.3, Exhibit R-27.\n\nRejoinder, para. 198, n.367.\n\n684.\n\nIn contrast to the Investors' arguments, the Respondent also submits that: the JRP \"was actually very interested in the issue of adaptive management\", rather than \"hostile\" to it;975 the JRP \"considered mitigation measures throughout its report in assessing the significance of the environmental effects of the Whites Point project\";976 in light of Bilcon's lack of responsiveness to relevant information requests and the poor quality of the information presented by it during the EA, the JRP noted that \"the accumulation of concerns about adequacy leads the Panel to question the Project\"977 and the JRP \"was not satisfied that Bilcon had proven itself capable of using either adaptive management or mitigation as effective tools for monitoring and responding to unforeseen environmental effects\";978 and the lack of quality and responsive information provided by the Investors \"was one of the most important circumstances governing how the Whites Point JRP managed the process....

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n685.\n\nBilcon submits that its application was evaluated not only according to criteria that departed from the core standards of the *CEAA*, but that this valuation was less favorable than the treatment accorded to a number of Canadian investors in like circumstances.\n\n686.\n\nNAFTA Article 1102 reads:\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n3. The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.\n\n4. For greater certainty, no Party may:\n\n(a) impose on an investor of another Party a requirement that a minimum level of equity in an enterprise in the territory of the Party be held by its nationals, other than nominal qualifying shares for directors or incorporators of corporations; or\n\n(b) require an investor of another Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment in the territory of the Party.\n\n687.\n\nBilcon refers to a number of projects involving quarries and marine terminals in ecologically sensitive zones where the project was evaluated on a more favorable basis than Bilcon's. Bilcon emphasizes that the issue is not whether the outcome of the review was different, but rather whether Canada provided less favorable treatment concerning the mode of review (JRP) and the evaluative standard, including the application of the usual *CEAA* standard of likely significant adverse effects after mitigation.\n\n688.\n\nWith respect to the mode of review, the evidence is clear that subjecting the Bilcon project to a Review Panel at either the federal Canada or joint level, was unusual. The Expert Report of Mr. Estrin shows that only about 0.3% of environmental assessments under the *CEAA* take the form of a panel review or mediation. About 98.8% are carried out by screenings, and 0.9% by comprehensive study.980 None of these projects involved a quarry.981 The areas of projects that were assessed by review panels were generally much larger than the Whites Point Quarry,982 and sometimes involved novel or inherently dangerous activities such as the handling of liquified natural gas or radioactive materials.983 The Tribunal has already determined, however, that Bilcon is barred by limitation periods in Chapter Eleven from challenging whether the referral to a JRP was itself a breach of NAFTA.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 8, citing the lists of assessment maintained by the CEA Agency.\n\nFirst Export Report of David Estrin, para. 29.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 29.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 19.\n\n689.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, will focus its analysis on the application of the \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" standard rather than the choice of the mode of review.\n\n690.\n\nCanada suggests that the only projects that should be compared to Bilcon's are those where there was a joint federal Canada-provincial review panel.984 Canada has also suggested that a comparator is only in \"like circumstances\" if the JRP had to deal with significant opposition within a local community.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 411.\n\n691.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that it should confine an Article 1102 analysis in this case to such a narrow range of possible comparators.\n\n692.\n\nArticle 1102 refers to situations where investors or investments find themselves in \"like circumstances\". The language is not restricted as it is in some other trade-liberalizing agreements, such as those that refer to \"like products\". Article 1102 refers to the way in which either the investor or investment is treated, rather than confining concerns over discrimination to comparisons between similar articles of trade.985 Moreover, the operative word in Article 1102 is \"similar\", not \"identical\". In addition to giving the reasonably broad language of Article 1102 its due, a Tribunal must also take into account the objects of NAFTA, which include according to Article 102(1)(c) \"to increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties\".\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, Final Award, 1 July 2004, para. 175.\n\n693.\n\nThe Investors note that in the *Occidental* case, a violation of national treatment was alleged under a bilateral investment treaty that stipulated national treatment for investors in \"like situations\" to domestic investors. The investor complained of unfavorable treatment of an oil producer compared to other exporters. Ecuador argued that comparators must be confined to oil exporters. The *Occidental* tribunal disagreed. It observed that \"the purpose of national treatment is to protect investors as compared to local producers, and this cannot be done by addressing exclusively the sector in which the particular activity is conducted\".986 The tribunal found that there was a denial of national treatment when a scheme for calculating the VAT taxes on an oil exporter was more burdensome than that applied to domestic exporters of other products, such as those selling flowers or mining products.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, Final Award, para. 173.\n\n694.\n\nCases of alleged denial of national treatment must be decided in their own factual and regulatory context. In the present case, what is at issue is whether the Investor was treated less favorably for the purpose of an environmental assessment. The federal Canada law in question, the *CEAA*, is one of very general application. It applies the \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" standard of assessment as a necessary component of environmental review across a wide range of modes and industries, including any marine terminals or quarries that are assessed under its provisions.\n\n695.\n\nThe Investors argue that \"the NAFTA Tribunal should consider all enterprises affected by the environmental assessment regulatory process to be in like circumstances with Bilcon\".987 While that broad proposition might be correct, adopting it would commit this Tribunal to a more abstract and sweeping proposition than is necessary to decide this case. The Tribunal finds, that on examination of their particular facts, many of the comparison cases brought forward by the Investors qualify as \"sufficiently\" similar to sustain an Article 1102 comparison for the purposes of this case.\n\nMemorial, para. 407.\n\n696.\n\nThe actual comparison cases brought forward by the Investors in the present case generally involve federal Canada or JRP assessments of mining projects, including oil and gas exploration, accompanied by exports that involve sea routes. A number of them specifically involved quarry and marine terminal export projects that had the potential to affect a local community. At least three of them involved assessments that included the marine terminal component of a project that was connected to a quarry and took place in an ecologically sensitive coastal area. The fact that assessments in these cases were carried out in accordance with the usual \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" analysis is sufficient to conclude that they received more favorable treatment than did the Investors in like circumstances. The Tribunal finds that these three cases, *Belleoram, Aguathuna* and *Tiverton,* are definitely among those in which domestic investors were accorded more favorable treatment than Bilcon in circumstances that are sufficiently \"like\" to sustain a comparison under Article 1102.\n\n697.\n\nThe *Belleoram* Project involved developing a quarry and terminal project that would have covered six times the area and produced up to 300% more rock annually than the proposed project at Whites Point.988 An official of Canada itself noted that the Whites Point Quarry and Belleoram Projects were \"very similar.\"989 The Belleoram Project was to be carried out by a Canadian controlled company with the financial support of federal Canada. The Belleoram Project was located one kilometre away from populated areas. It was geared to the export market. It was not subjected to a JRP process. Only the marine terminal was assessed for the purposes of the laws of federal Canada. Many of the issues considered in the review were similar to those at Whites Point. Indeed, federal officials recognized early on in the Bilcon process that \"many of the environmental concerns will be similar\" to Belleoram.990 The comprehensive study route was adopted for the purposes of the laws of Canada and completed in only a year and a half. The report identified a variety of likely significant adverse effects and considered that all of them would be mitigated to a satisfactory extent by the adoption of mitigation measures that could reasonably be applied.991 The Tribunal emphasizes again that it does not preclude the possibility that different outcomes could still have been reasonably obtained in Whites Point and Belleoram if the same standard had been applied. What is of critical importance here is that the Whites Point project did not receive the expected and legally mandated application, for the purposes of federal Canada environmental assessment, of the essential evaluative standard under the *CEAA.*\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix E, p. 2.\n\nInternal Environment Canada E-mail from Kevin Blair to Jeanette Goulet, Exhibit C-189.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix A, p. 3, referring to e-mail from Barry Jeffrey to Steven Zwicker, dated 5 May 2006.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix E, p. 14.\n\n698.\n\nThe Tribunal would adopt a similar analysis with respect to another quarry and marine terminal project in Newfoundland and Labrador, the *Aguathuna Quarry and Marine Terminal.*992\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix F (Aguathuna Quarry and Marine Terminal Project).\n\n699.\n\nAnother Canadian-owned comparator invoked by Bilcon is the *Tiverton Harbour* project in Nova Scotia. The proponent was federal Canada. Tiverton involved the construction of a new harbour facility, which was \"just down the road\" from the Whites Point Quarry location.993 Construction involved producing approximately 65,000 tonnes of rock and stone to create a new breakwater.994 Some of the blasting had to be carried out underwater, with potentially much greater destruction of fish habitat than would have resulted from blasting on land at some setback from the water, as in Bilcon's proposed project.995 Fish habitat might also have been affected by construction of a break-water, installation of floating docks, dredging the basin and constructing the wharf. The potential for damage to fish habitat was greater at Tiverton because there was underwater blasting and the deposit of a large volume of rock on the harbor floor.996\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix G, p. 1.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix G, p. 1.\n\nMemorial, para. 553, citing First Expert Report of David Estrin, para. 63.\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix G, p. 1.\n\n700.\n\nThe Tiverton Harbor project was subjected, at the federal Canada level, only to a screening and not a comprehensive study or panel review, which took about a year. Potential adverse effects were identified and addressed, to the satisfaction of authorities in Canada, by various mitigation measures, including the replacement of fish habitat. It appears that the standard *CEAA* analysis was carried out; mitigation measures were identified in respect of potential effects and it was determined that there would be no likely significant adverse effects after mitigation measures with respect to specific identified components of the environment.997 Canada contends that Tiverton involved a quarry that would only be operated for several months to provide material for the terminal. Furthermore, there was no significant public opposition.998 These points might weigh both on whether it was reasonable to conduct a lower-level of environmental assessment (a comprehensive assessment or screening rather than review panel) of the quarry or even of the terminal, notwithstanding that the environmental impacts might have been as serious, even potentially more serious in some respects, than the Bilcon project. They might provide a basis for explaining why the analysis by the JRP in this case could focus considerable attention on reporting and analyzing concerns raised by members of the local community. These points do not explain, however, why the Bilcon project was not, as part of the analysis, subjected in all of its likely adverse effects to the same thorough application of the approach\u2014including identifying mitigation measures\u2014required by s. 16 of the *CEAA.*\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, Appendix G, p. 7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 449-452.\n\n701.\n\nTo summarize the possible points of distinction, and why the Tribunal rejects them, the following observations need to be made. First, it is true that with respect to the projects\u2014 Belleoram, Agathuna and Tiverton\u2014federal Canada did not refer the marine terminal to a review panel. A \"likely significant adverse effects analysis\" under the *CEAA* must be at least part of the analysis carried out by an environmental assessment, regardless of whether the mode of review is a screening, a comprehensive study, a federal Canada review panel, or a joint review panel. Confining the choice of comparators to review panels or joint review panels appears to unreasonably limit the examination of comparisons that are relevant in light of the objects of Chapter Eleven.\n\n702.\n\nSecondly, it is also true that in this trio of cases, there was no joint federal-provincial panel. As Canada itself has conceded, a JRP must carry out both its federal Canada and provincial mandates. It is a real point of departure from the standard of host state conduct required by Article 1102 if a foreign investor is treated less favorably than domestic investors in like circumstances for the purposes of the laws of its central government.\n\n703.\n\nA further potential point of distinction is that the quarry was not subjected to a federal Canada review in all three comparison cases. Again, such a distinction cannot be dispositive. Discrimination in respect of the assessment of a major component of a project can amount to a material breach of Article 1102.\n\n704.\n\nOne more potential point of distinction is that these cases, while potentially having effects on local communities, did not produce strong local community opposition.999 Such a distinction might justify a different approach to commissioning a review panel rather than a comprehensive study or screening, thereby ensuring a more thorough and transparent canvassing of public concerns. Furthermore, the concerns raised by a local community must be fully considered and potential effects on the community assessed in accordance with the federal Canada legal framework. The distinction does not, however, under the laws of federal Canada, warrant an environmental assessment that fails to properly carry out, as at least a component, \"a likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" analysis.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 463.\n\n705.\n\nFinally, Canada argues that the outcomes of different reviews of projects involving quarries and marine terminals might be legitimately different based on the facts. The Tribunal agrees. Bilcon argues, however, that it is part of the analysis of \"treatment\" whether a less favorable evaluative standard applied. The Tribunal again agrees. When a quarry project is combined with a marine terminal, and one or both components are assessed under the laws of federal Canada or Nova Scotia, it can be a denial of national treatment to apply a harsher standard to the nonCanadian project in like circumstances.\n\n706.\n\nThe JRP in *Rabaska,* a case mentioned earlier in this Award,1000 provides a particularly telling comparator. Similar circumstances included: the assessment was carried out by a JRP; the assessment concerned resource processing and export\u2014a liquefied national gas terminal connected to a pipeline; the export was to the United States, and concerns were expressed about the balance of local benefits and burdens compared to those applying outside of Canada; the project was in a bucolic rural area where many residents cherished the peace and natural beauty of the area; the project was to be located near the St. Lawrence River, with attendant concerns about the consequences of ice, high density of shipping and collisions; there was a nearby community that was divided over the project, with many of the residents expressing opposition and the local government challenging the project under local zoning laws.1001\n\n*See* para. 565 above.\n\nA detailed comparison is set out in the First Expert Report of David Estrin, paras 288-300.\n\n707.\n\nThe Rabaska JRP fully acknowledged in its final report the reviews of both supporters and opponents, including reporting in plain language the fear and anxiety of some local residents about the dangers associated with the plant. The Rabaska JRP, however, did not take one side or the other in the local community debate, or allow local opposition to pre-empt the carrying out of a \"likely significant effects after mitigation\" assessment of the environmental effects of the project. The JRP proposed a number of mitigation measures to specifically address the concerns of local residents, including providing a program of financial compensation for residents located near the project who wished to relocate, a compensation program for those who might sustain losses in their property values and compensation for residents whose insurance premiums might rise due to the project. The Rabaska JRP further proposed ongoing requirements on the proponent to inform and meet with the public.\n\n708.\n\nThe Rabaska JRP in the end found that the project, after mitigation, would have no likely significant adverse effects. It is not the particular outcome on the facts, however, that is the basis for a finding in this Award of less favorable treatment for Bilcon's project; it is the fact that the Rabaska JRP followed the legally required standard in carrying out and reporting its assessment.\n\n709.\n\nAnother relevant comparator is the *Cacouna Energy LNG Terminal Project*. As noted in the first expert report of Mr. Estrin:\n\nLike the WPQ project, the Cacouna project was located next to a sensitive marine environment, and involved a marine terminal component. In both cases there was significant community opposition, including concerns about the impact on tourism. In both cases, the RAs were DFO and Transport Canada.\n\nThe Cacouna hearings revealed that, like in the case of the WPQ project, there were two competing visions for the community. The Cacouna Panel noted that there were \"two visions of development in the area: on one hand industrial, and on the other hand development based on the natural environmental and heritage resources.\" Unlike the WPQ Panel, however, the Cacouna Panel did not select which of these two visions was representative of the community's \u2018core values'. And the Cacouna Panel certainly did not determine that any effects of the proposal on the community's values constituted a significant adverse environmental effect. The Cacouna Panel ultimately recommended that the project could proceed.\n\nLike the Rabaska Panel\u2014but unlike the WPQ Panel\u2014the Cacouna Panel recommended measures that could facilitate community acceptance of the project. Specifically, the Cacouna Panel stated:\n\nThe Panel is of the opinion that Health Canada and the Centre de sant\u00e9 et de services sociaux de Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, in collaboration with the community and the proponent, should participate in determining the need for follow-up on the social impacts on the community of Cacouna. The Panel invites the concerned parties to look at existing public participation techniques in order to determine the best tool for achieving this objective.1002\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 337-339.\n\n710.\n\nThe first expert report of Mr. Estrin observes more generally that:\n\nThe WPQ Panel was the first and only Panel established under *CEAA* to recommend the rejection of a project on the basis of \"community core values\" or any similar concept.\n\nNone of the 29 reports ever issued by a review panel or a joint review panel under *CEAA*, except for the WPQ Panel Report, refers to \"community cores values\". Indeed, other projects that were highly divisive in their community have been recommended for approval, such as the Rabaska Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal in Quebec, discussed above...1003\n\nFirst Expert Report of David Estrin, paras. 334-335.\n\n711.\n\nThe Chair of the JRP in the present case, Mr. Fournier, in his radio interview cited previously, compares the JRP's approach to that of other panels.\n\nYes, there were people who said this was inappropriate, but I think it was only inappropriate if you judged it against previous reports, because previous reports hadn't done this. What we are saying is those previous reports could have done this or perhaps should have done this looking at the social component, you see.1004\n\nTranscription by Appleton & Associates of the CBC Interview with Robert Fournier, dated 20 December 2007, Exhibit C-180.\n\n712.\n\nFrom his own perspective, then, the distinctive approach of the JRP was not merely due to unique circumstances, but due to the Panel's innovative understanding of the general way in which assessments should be carried out.\n\n713.\n\nThere is another aspect of the JRP's approach that requires examination in the context of an Article 1102 analysis: the JRP's emphasis on a local/regional/national/international matrix to analyze the potential benefits and burdens of the project.\n\n714.\n\nThe EIS Guidelines for the Bilcon's project did not specifically refer to a mandate to compare the relative distribution of benefits and burdens along international, as opposed to local, regional or national lines. As noted earlier, the JRP's actual characterization of benefits and burdens appears in some respects to be skewed against the Investors: for example, the fact that the Investors would be risking millions of dollars to fund the project is not seen as a \"burden\" to counterbalance its potential benefits by way of access to construction material. The fact that governments will not gain from the investment by way of royalty taxes is portrayed as a burden; the fact that local governments are not required to invest in the project is not portrayed as a benefit.\n\n715.\n\nThe emphasis on the comparative balance of burdens and benefits, and the emphasis on \"community core values,\" raises the serious question of whether the project would have received more favorable treatment if the investor had not been foreign. Had the investor been local, for example, would the JRP have considered the impact on \"community core values\" to be decisive, without examining mitigating effects?\n\n716.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded, quite apart from considering the impact and implications of the local/national/regional/international matrix, that the JRP's approach amounted to unequal and unfavorable treatment of Bilcon. It is not necessary, therefore, for the Tribunal to arrive at a definitive conclusion about the extent to which the use of the matrix may have contributed to a breach of Article 1102.\n\n717.\n\nCanada submits that according to the *UPS* award the burden of proof is on Bilcon to show: that a government accorded Bilcon or its investment \"treatment\" during the environmental assessment and \"that the same government accorded treatment to other domestic or foreign investors or investments\"; that the treatment was \"less favorable\" than that accorded other domestic or foreign proponents; and \"the government accorded the allegedly discriminatory treatment in question \u2018in like circumstances'\".1005\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 400, citing *United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, paras. 83-84.\n\n718.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that Bilcon had the affirmative burden of proving these three points, but finds that it has done so.\n\n719.\n\nIt should be noted that the *UPS* test does not require a demonstration of discriminatory intent. The *Feldman* tribunal explained:\n\nIt is clear that the concept of national treatment as embodied in NAFTA and similar agreements are designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of nationality, or \"by reason of nationality\". (U.S. Statement of Administrative Action, Article 1102.) However, it is not self-evident, as the Respondent argues that any departure from national treatment must be *explicitly* shown to be a result of the investor's nationality. There is no such language in Article 1102. Rather, Article 1102 by its terms suggests that it is sufficient to show less favorable treatment for the foreign investor than for domestic investors in like circumstances. In this instance, the evidence on the record demonstrates that there is only one U.S. citizen/investor, the Claimant, that alleges a violation of national treatment under NAFTA Article 1102 (transcript, July 13, 2001, p. 178), and at least one domestic investor (Mr. Poblano) who has been treated more favorably. For practical as well as legal reasons, the Tribunal is prepared to assume that the differential treatment is a result of the Claimant's nationality, at least in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.1006\n\n*Marvin Feldman v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, para. 181.\n\n720.\n\nIf a *prima facie* case is made under the three-part *UPS* test, can a host state still show that there is no breach because the discriminatory treatment identified is somehow justified, or that the discriminatory treatment is not sufficiently linked to nationality, but merely an incidental effect of the reasonable pursuit of domestic policy objectives?\n\n721.\n\nArticle 1102 is not attached to any \"justification\" clause, such as Article XX of GATT, 1947, which permits an exception to its norms in cases where a state has adopted reasonable measures to pursuing certain domestic policy objectives. Article XX reads in part:\n\nSubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures.\n\n(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health.\n\n722.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Pope & Talbot*, however, held that:\n\nDifferences in treatment will presumptively violate Article 1102(2), unless they have a reasonable nexus to rational government policies that (1) do not distinguish, on their face or *de facto*, between foreign-owned and domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly undermine the investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA.1007\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, 10 April 2001, para. 78.\n\n723.\n\nThe approach taken in *Pope & Talbot*, would seem to provide legally appropriate latitude for host states, even in the absence of an equivalent of Article XX of the GATT, to pursue reasonable and non-discriminatory domestic policy objectives through appropriate measures even when there is an incidental and reasonably unavoidable burden on foreign enterprises. Consistently with the approach taken in the *Feldman* case, however, the present Tribunal is also of the view that once a *prima facie* case is made out under the three-part *UPS* test, the onus is on the host state to show that a measure is still sustainable within the terms of Article 1102. It is the host state that is in a position to identify and substantiate the case, in terms of its own laws, policies and circumstances, that an apparently discriminatory measure is in fact compliant with the \"national treatment\" norm set out in Article 1102.\n\n724.\n\nIn the present case the Tribunal is unable to discern any justification for the differential and adverse treatment accorded to Bilcon that would satisfy the *Pope & Talbot* test with respect to the standard of evaluation under the laws of federal Canada. The \"community core values\" approach adopted by the JRP was not a \"rational government policy\"; it was at odds with the law and policy of the *CEAA*. The approach of the JRP was not consistent with the investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA; indeed the Tribunal has found it to be incompatible with Article 1105.\n\n725.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Canada has denied national treatment to the Investment of the Investors. That decided, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine whether there was a distinct denial of national treatment to the Investors rather than to the Investment.\n\n726.\n\nThe Investor submits that Canada is also in breach of NAFTA Article 1103, the text of which is as follows:\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of investors of any other Party or of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n727.\n\nBilcon cites a series of projects in which the proponent was a foreign company or a Canadian subsidiary of a foreign company. All of them involved activities in which some form of land-based project (such as a refinery or mine) was involved as well as a marine terminal. The alleged better treatment in every case includes being subjected to a review of smaller scope (such as terminal only) at the federal level and using a screening or comprehensive study rather than a review panel. The Tribunal has, however, decided that challenges concerning the scope and level of review are barred by the timing provisions of NAFTA, thereby rendering a major component of every comparison irrelevant for the purposes of deciding this case. Thus a major dimension of the comparisons drops away.\n\n728.\n\nThe Investors also complain that issues such as \"cumulative effects\" and the precautionary principle were handled differently and more favorably in the comparison cases with respect to Article 1103. Whereas a set of detailed appendices provide in-depth analyses of some of the comparator projects that the Investors have invoked in the contest of its Article 1102 argument, there is no similarly detailed analysis in respect of the projects compared for the purposes of Article 1103. In the course of elaborating its Article 1103 argument the Investors do, however, devote several pages to describing various comparator projects and refer to some of the related documents.\n\n729.\n\nIt is understandable that neither side devoted a large part of its submissions to the Article 1103 issue. The comparisons in respect of Article 1103 are far closer (they all involve quarry and marine projects), and if a breach is found in respect of Article 1102, a further finding of liability under Article 1103 would not, in any plausible scenario, effect the measure of damages.\n\n730.\n\nIn view of the limited information provided, the immateriality of any finding in any plausible scenario, and the relative lack of attention to the issue by both sides, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary or prudent to decide the Article 1103 allegation.\n\n731.\n\nFor the reasons given, the Tribunal concludes that the approach taken by the JRP and adopted by Canada resulted in a breach of Article 1102.\n\n**VII. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. NEXT PROCEDURAL STEPS**\n----------------------------\n\n732.\n\nThe Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3 accepted Canada's position that this proceeding should be divided into a merits phase and a damages phase. The Tribunal has found that Bilcon has established breaches of Article 1102 and 1105 of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA. To the extent that there is any possible legal requirement at the merits phase to make a *prima facie* case for the existence of at least some loss or damage, Bilcon has done so. The Tribunal makes no prejudgment whatsoever about the ultimate outcome on compensation if the Parties do not settle this case by agreement. Both Parties will have the opportunity, if they do not resolve the matter through a settlement, to submit evidence and argument to this Tribunal concerning the quantum of a compensation award for loss or damage and concerning the allocation of the costs of this arbitration.\n\n**B. ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n733.\n\nSince a draft of this Award was prepared, the majority of the Tribunal has had the privilege and benefit of reviewing the opinion of our distinguished colleague, who in the end agrees with many parts of the Award but dissents from its finding with respect to a breach of Article 1105 **.** Our colleague's thoughtful critique on some aspects contributed to some refinements to the final draft above.\n\n734.\n\nThe majority would add only a few observations that are intended primarily to address concerns raised by our colleague about possible wider implications of this Award.\n\n735.\n\nThe finding in this Award is not based on any view that environmental assessors should be wary of robustly and fully carrying out their assigned mandates. The concern here is that the JRP, whatever else it was assigned or volunteered to do, was required to implement the part of its mandate that involved a proper analysis of \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\".\n\n736.\n\nAn analysis of \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" does not place economics or technology above human concerns. Rather, it seeks to assess potential impacts on the environment, and to determine whether these effects can be mitigated in their own right, rather than being overborne by economic or public interest considerations. While political preferences or values are not environmental effects in and of themselves, the value that human beings place on potentially affected components of the ecosystem is indeed integral to the analysis. Scientific and technical concerns, along with public input, inform an assessment of potential effects and the exploration of options for reducing or eliminating them.\n\n737.\n\nThe express objectives of NAFTA do include the encouragement of investment. Chapter Eleven does seek to avoid \"investor chill\" that might result from the prospect of certain kinds of discrimination or unfair treatment. In interpreting and applying these provisions, however, the majority of the present Tribunal agrees with the concern of our colleague that a NAFTA tribunal must be sensitive to the need to avoid \"regulatory chill\", including with respect to protection of the environment.\n\n738.\n\nIt may bear reiterating, therefore, the Tribunal's view that under NAFTA, lawmakers in Canada and the other NAFTA parties can set environmental standards as demanding and broad as they wish and can vest in various administrative bodies whatever mandates they wish. Errors, even substantial errors, in applying national laws do not generally, let alone automatically, rise to the level of international responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis foreign investors. The trigger for international responsibility in this particular case was the very specific set of facts that were presented, tested and established through an extensive litigation process.\n\n739.\n\nIn the present case the evidence shows that some of the individual factual elements were highly unusual in their own right. The unprecedented nature of the JRP's approach is confirmed by remarks of the Chair of the Panel. Extensive and detailed expert testimony confirmed that the approach was not only at variance with the existing legal framework, but also with the actual treatment provided in comparable cases. The comparators included situations involving coastal mining and marine terminals as well as situations where a local community was politically divided over the project.\n\n740.\n\nThe distinctive and exceptional overall set of facts that came together to produce a finding of liability in this particular case include:\n\n\u2022 representations from state officials that welcomed investors to pursue coastal quarry and marine terminal projects, and to these investors specifically to do so at the particular site;\n\n\u2022 reliance by the Investors on those encouragements to devote very substantial resources to engaging in the statutorily mandated environmental assessments, including the attempt to design the project to meet all legal requirements concerning environmental protection;\n\n\u2022 an approach to the assessment by the JRP that effectively found the area to be a \"no go\" zone for projects of this kind, rather than including, as at least a major part of its work, a proper assessment of likely significant adverse effects on the environment and of the means by which these effects might have been mitigated;\n\n\u2022 lack of prior notice to the investor of the unprecedented approach the JRP was going to adopt, thereby denying the investor a fair opportunity to seek clarification and respond;\n\n\u2022 the role of the JRP in the overall system as legislated includes providing in its report an impartial and thorough assessment of facts and of mitigation options that can be used by the ultimate decision makers in government and that can inform public opinion.\n\n741.\n\nThe *CEAA* prescribes finding ways to promote both dimensions of sustainable development, that is to say, environmental protection and economic growth. The *NSEA* acknowledges that protection of the environment requires a strong economy. The regional *Vision 2000* statement observes that activities of primary industries, including mining, can be carried out in a way that maintains and even enhances the region's culture and environment. Whether or not their case would have prevailed if appropriately evaluated, the Investors' case was that this particular project could in fact be constructed and operated in a way that would satisfy both economic and environmental concerns. It would, in the Investors' submission, have diversified the local economy, which was stressed by limitations on harvesting the living resources of the sea, and encouraged community residents to remain in the community while at the same time it would have preserved an environment that supports traditional industries and modern ecotourism and that is valued for its beauty and tranquility. The Tribunal's respectful conclusion is that in all the particular and unusual circumstances of this case, the Investors were denied an expected and just opportunity to have their case considered on its individual merits.\n\n**VIII. DISPOSITIF**\n--------------------\n\n742.\n\n**In light of the foregoing, and having considered carefully the Parties' arguments and the evidence before it, the Tribunal,**\n\n**a) In respect of Mr. William Richard Clayton, Mr. Douglas Clayton, Mr. Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc.,**\n\n**i.** ***Unanimously*** **decides that the Tribunal has jurisdiction insofar as these Investors base their claims on events occurring on or after 17 June 2005; the Respondent's jurisdictional objection is upheld insofar as the Investors base their claims on events occurring prior to that date;**\n\n**ii.** ***By majority vote*** **decides that the Respondent has failed to accord to investments of these Investors treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, in breach of Article 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment);**\n\n**iii.** ***By majority vote*** **decides that the Respondent has failed to accord to investments of these Investors treatment no less favorable than that it has accorded, in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors, in breach of Article 1102 (National Treatment);**\n\n**b) In respect of Mr. William Ralph Clayton,** ***unanimously*** **reserves its position as to whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an \"investor\" for purposes of NAFTA; accordingly, the Tribunal makes no decision in respect of the merits of the case in relation to him;**\n\n**c)** ***Unanimously*** **defers any decision on the quantum of compensation owed to the Investors as well as any decision on costs to a later stage of these proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Award on Damages", "Type": "Compensation", "Date": "2019-01-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Concurring Opinion of Professor Bryan Schwartz", "Type": "Concurring Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Concurring Opinion of Professor Bryan Schwartz\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI concur with the compensation figure reached by the Tribunal in its Award on Damages. In my respectful view the Tribunal's Award presents a thorough account of the Parties' submissions and a well-articulated analysis of the legal principles and their application to the facts of this case.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal's view is that the Investors did not satisfy the burden of showing that they would have obtained regulatory approval had the environmental assessment been conducted in a NAFTA-compliant manner. I agree that the evidence does not support an approach in which regulatory approval risk is essentially disregarded, and compensation is then awarded on the basis of estimates of future profitability of a project over the long life of the project's fully-expected operation.\n\n3.\n\nIn this separate concurring opinion, I wish to consider an approach to valuing the Investors' compensation based on viewing its losses as a lost *chance -* not a certainty - of obtaining regulatory approval and then operating the project profitably. The value of the chance would be based on the expert evidence of jurists on the likelihood of success at a judicial review and a regulatory do-over and on the expert evidence of specialists in business projections concerning future profitability.\n\n4.\n\nMy route to the same compensation figure outcome as the Tribunal takes into account the following two considerations:\n\n\u2022 that in my understanding, in an appropriate case, an investor might be able to recover compensation where it is able to demonstrate a substantial probability that an investment would have received regulatory approval to proceed had it been considered in a manner consistent with the applicable international law on investor protection. In appropriate factual circumstances, in my view, the just measure of compensation will be for a lost opportunity. The best measure of compensation in some circumstances might take into account an estimate of the probability of obtaining a permit and an estimate of the likely profits if a permit was granted.\n\n\u2022 the evidence shows, in my respectful view, that the Investors actually had a high probability of obtaining a permit on economically viable terms had the environmental assessment been carried out in a NAFTA-compliant manner in the first place. It would similarly have had a high probability of eventual success had a judicial review been pursued of the initial regulatory determinations and a \"do-over\" of the permitting process had been ordered and carried out.\n\n5.\n\nBased on these considerations, I support the Tribunal's determination of quantum of damages for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 as a primary reason, *the Investors had a duty to mitigate their damages.* Assuming a high likelihood of success in eventually obtaining a permit, the Investors cannot reasonably claim all of its lost profits after abandoning the investment rather than pursuing it. The more powerful the case is that the Investors could have succeeded on a judicial review in the courts of Canada and a \"do-over\" of the regulatory approval process, the more powerful the case is that they reasonably should have sought to mitigate their damages by pursuing those avenues.\n\n\u2022 as a secondary and supporting reason, there is a substantial measure of uncertainty about what the profits would have been had Canadian authorities granted the permit. The Tribunal heard from two experts who impressed me as doing their best to be impartial, and who exhibited a sophisticated understanding of the general principles of estimating damages, and of the facts of this particular case. Yet their estimates were radically different. The approach adopted by the Tribunal by contrast, has the advantage of fixing damages based largely, although not exclusively, on evidence of actual past expenditures. This consideration about the uncertainty of lost profits is not by itself decisive for me. If justice otherwise clearly required, I might have been prepared to make a reasonable estimate of lost profits, multiply it by a reasonable estimate of the likelihood of obtaining a permit on a NAFTA-compliant basis, and award compensation on that basis.\n\n6.\n\nThese considerations reinforce each other on the facts of this case. By pursuing mitigation measures, the Investors could have potentially eliminated much of the uncertainty about their losses. They could have pursued judicial review, sought a do-over of the permitting processes, and potentially proceeded with the project and realized the actual profits. They might still have recovered losses under NAFTA - e.g., for the extra costs of going through these processes and the delays in commencing profitable operations compared to obtaining regulatory approval on the first go-round - but there would be no need for the Tribunal to weigh drastically different expert reports on future long-term profits.\n\n**II. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES ON DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nBefore elaborating these concrete points further, I will review the basic principles concerning damages.\n\n8.\n\nThe general principle under international law is that a wronged party should receive compensation that fully offsets the losses that result from an internationally wrongful act. Under NAFTA there is no specific formula provided for a breach of Articles 1102 and 1105. (By contrast, there is a particular damages formula in the case of expropriations; Article 1110.) International law does, however, provide guidance on the considerations that are involved in interpreting and applying the general principle to the facts of a particular case. These guiding principles include:\n\n\u2022 the onus of proof is on the claimant;\n\n\u2022 the standard of proof is similar or identical to that used in civil proceedings in many domestic legal systems, rather than the exceptionally high standard used in criminal cases, such as beyond a reasonable doubt. \"In all probability\" is the phrase used in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, but modern tribunals in investment law cases have deployed language that might be interpreted as still demanding, but perhaps not quite as high. In *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1 (2014), at paragraph 38, the tribunal refers to \"persuasive evidence of damages from actions alleged to constitute breaches of NAFTA obligations\". In *Gold Reserve Inc. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1 (2014), paragraph 385, the tribunal states, after reviewing all the authorities submitted by the parties in that case, that \"balance of probabilities\" is the standard of proof at both the liability and quantum stages. I tend to agree with the *Gold Reserve* formulation;\n\n\u2022 damages may not be awarded to the extent that they flow from an unlawful act, but were not within the range of adverse outcomes that could be reasonably expected; for a general discussion of requirements of proximate cause, see the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries 2001, Article 31, footnote 10;\n\n\u2022 the claimant has a duty to mitigate its losses; see International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries 2001, Article 31, footnote 11;\n\n\u2022 the mere difficulty of arriving at precise figures should not necessarily preclude a claimant from receiving a reasonable measure of compensation. \"[I]t is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred. In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not an exact science\"; *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.* Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (formerly *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentine Republic)*. A tribunal should, however, avoid arriving at figures that are wholly speculative.\n\n**III. APPLYING THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES TO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn my view, international law supports the proposition that the determination of compensation can, depending on the facts, be based on several different approaches that include:\n\n\u2022 \"sunk costs\". The investor is compensated for the investment costs it expended before the project ceased;\n\n\u2022 \"lost profits from an expected successful project\". The Investors in this case proposed compensation based on \"discounted cash flow\" for the life of a project that, in its submission, was \"virtually certain\" to have obtained regulatory approval had it been considered in a NAFTA-compliant manner;\n\n\u2022 an in-between approach, in which the investor is compensated for a lost opportunity - not a certainty - of obtaining regulatory approval and otherwise being able to proceed with the project, absent the internationally wrongful act.\n\n10.\n\nAn analogy in domestic law to the third option might be a case in a domestic legal system where a lawyer negligently misses a limitation period for bringing a complex action. Damages against the lawyer might be based on expert estimates of the likelihood of success and the likely damages in the event of success. A plaintiff might not be denied recovery merely because of the inevitable uncertainties associated with litigating a complex case. Experts might provide informed estimates based on their own experience with similar litigation and statistics about success rates in other cases. There might be various market indicators of the value of the opportunity to proceed with the litigation - e.g., the stock market price of shares in a publicly traded company might drop a certain amount on disclosure that its lawyer missed a filing deadline. There might also be evidence about whether any lawyers did or would have taken on the case on a contingency fee basis.\n\n11.\n\nRegulatory approval risk, it seems to me, can be built into damages under international investment law in other contexts. For example, where a business is expropriated, compensation might be based on fair market value - which could include the market's assessment of the likelihood of various regulatory approvals. With a publicly-traded company, the value of shares might often incorporate probabilities (as assessed by stock market traders) of various regulatory outcomes. A fair market value award to an expropriated business, therefore, would compensate an investor in circumstances where regulatory approval is a substantial possibility, but considerably far from certain.\n\n12.\n\nThere are international investment case law precedents and academic commentary that directly acknowledge that damages to an investor can represent the value of a lost opportunity. These developments are reviewed in an article submitted by Canada, Borzu Sabahi and Luk\u00e1s Hoder, \"*Certainty in Recovery of Damages for Losses to New or Incomplete Businesses - Three Paradigms: Biloune v. Ghana, Gemplus v. Mexico, and Siag v. Egypt\";* The Journal of Damages in International Arbitration Law. The authors point out, on pages 103-4, that:\n\n\"Some legal systems allow recovery for 'loss of opportunity' or 'loss of chance'. Article 7.4.3(2) of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, which draws upon domestic legal systems, for example, provides that:\n\n'Article 7.4.3 - *Certainty of Harm*\n\n(1) Compensation is due only for harm, including future harm, that is established with a reasonable degree of certainty.\n\n(2) *Compensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence*.\n\n(3) Where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty, the assessment is at the discretion of the court'. (emphasis added)\n\nRipinsky and Williams [Damages in International Investment Law] in this connection note that:\n\n'Where a tribunal cannot accept a claim for lost profits as not sufficiently certain, it may choose to award, instead, a compensation for the loss of business (commercial) opportunity, or for the loss of a chance. This head of damage appears to be a sub-species of lost profits, which is resorted to when the available data does not allow making a more precise calculation of lost profits.... It is suggested that a chance of making a profit is an asset with a value of its own, and that compensation for the loss of a chance is an alternative to the award of lost profits proper in cases where the claimant has failed to prove the amount of the alleged loss of profit with the required degree of certainty, but where the tribunal was satisfied that the loss in fact occurred.\n\nLoss of a chance can thus be used as a tool allowing the injured party to receive some form of compensation for the loss of a chance to make a profit. In theory, the loss of a chance is assessed by reference to the degree of probability of the chance turning out in the plaintiff's favour, although in practice the amount awarded on this account is often discretionary.'\"\n\n13.\n\nThe authors then point out that the \"lost opportunity\" approach was applied in *Sapphire v. National Iranian Oil Company*, [March 15, 1963], 35ILR136 (1967) and, under modern investment treaty arbitration practice, in *Gemplus S.A., SLP S.A., Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. and Talsud S.A. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4 Award (June 16, 2010), IIC 488 (2010). In that case, an enterprise in its early stages of development was expropriated. The tribunal there adopted an approach between lost investment costs and discounted future cash flow of a successful business. \"The concept of certainty is both relative and reasonable in its application, to be adjusted to the circumstances of the particular case.\" Instead, it adopted the \"lost opportunity\" approach, based on its finding that there was no certainty of profitability as the project was originally envisaged, but that there was nonetheless a reasonable opportunity for success.\n\n14.\n\nIf it were not for the application of the mitigation of damages principle, I might have adopted a particular way of valuing the lost opportunity. Damages would have been based on multiplying two estimates: first, the probability of obtaining regulatory approval based on the evidence of legal experts, and second, the likely future profits in the event of regulatory approval based on the evidence of the experts on business projections. (The estimates of likely profits would take into account estimates of the cost of environmental mitigation measures that a NAFTA-compliant JRP would recommend and that governments would adopt or that governments would impose on their own). Judgment would have to be exercised in arriving at those figures; precise calculation would not be possible in this particular case. As the onus of proof is on the claimant, estimates of probabilities would have to avoid being unduly optimistic about the prospects of the project. At the same time, given the expert evidence on both regulatory approval risk and future profits, it might have been appropriate to make an award to the Investors in this case that was considerably higher than this Tribunal's actual result.\n\n**IV. MITIGATION OF DAMAGES**\n-----------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe principle of mitigation of damages is that a claimant is required to make reasonable efforts to reduce the extent of its losses. The causal connection between the wrongful act and a loss is diminished or eliminated to the extent that the claimant could have avoided it. By taking positive steps to reduce its own losses, a claimant may also benefit the community as a whole. A project like that of the Investors has the potential, on eventually receiving permits from government, to benefit not only its investors but also its employees, its suppliers, and the general public in the form of tax revenues.\n\n16.\n\nThe principle of mitigation in this case must be applied in the context of what measure of damages is sought.\n\n17.\n\nThe Investors chose to walk away from its investment after it was denied permits in the initial go-round. It brought this NAFTA claim. The Investors could have, however, pursued in parallel a claim for judicial review in the courts of Canada.\n\n18.\n\nIf the issue is framed as \"should the Investors recover some amount reasonably close to their investment costs in the project\" then the Investors did not fail to take reasonable measures to mitigate their losses. (The quantum of the Tribunal's Award is equivalent in amount to investment costs plus a modest return on them). Rather, the Investors made a reasonable judgment in not pursuing judicial review. It might have taken a number of years to instead seek judicial review of the rejection of its applications for government approval. A judicial review might have taken several years to complete. If successful, it would likely have resulted in a Joint Review Panel (\"JRP\"), differently constituted, conducting an assessment. The Investors might have then found it necessary to participate in a further environmental assessment process, again with no certain assurance of obtaining regulatory approval, and no certainty as to the terms and conditions for permits that governments would have attached. The Investors might have had to spend millions of dollars along the way in further process costs and on maintaining the property.\n\n19.\n\nIf the issue is instead framed as \"should the Investors recover all of their estimated profits for over a half century of mining operations\" then, the Investors' claim that they took reasonable steps to mitigate their damages is not sustainable. The Investors would reap all the benefits of an operation they never actually carried out - without having attempted a process that might have enabled them to do so, and which had a high chance of success. An additional expenditure of perhaps five or six more years and several million dollars in process costs to pursue judicial review and then a regulatory \"do-over\", if successful, could have netted - relying on the Investors' own estimates in this case - a fifty year profitable operation that would have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits.\n\n20.\n\nThe Investors have presented testimony that they felt no confidence in the Canadian processes after the initial rejection. The issue of an investor's duty to mitigate, however, has to be looked at more objectively. The requirement is of reasonable efforts to mitigate. The evidence is that looking at the matter in an informed and dispassionate manner, the Investors actually had strong prospects had they pursued Canadian domestic remedies, including a judicial review and a doover of the environmental permitting process.\n\n21.\n\nAt the liability stage, the Investors produced two eminent experts on Canadian environmental law who presented detailed and cogently reasoned and documented analysis that the approach of the JRP was contrary to Canadian law. The Tribunal's Award on Jurisdiction and Liability accepted their essential conclusions about non-compliance with Canadian law in the course of the Tribunal's arriving at the wider and crucial conclusion about a breach of international obligations under NAFTA.\n\n22.\n\nAt the quantum of damages stage, Canada submitted a report from the Honourable John M. Evans with respect to the potential effectiveness for the Investors of pursuing judicial review in Canada. Mr. Evans served on the Federal Court of Appeal for over a decade, is a widely published and award-winning scholar, and is acknowledged by the Supreme Court of Canada as a leading expert in the area of judicial review of administrative tribunals. The Investors chose not to cross-examine him. I find his testimony persuasive on these points, among others:\n\n\u2022 even if the application had been contested all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada -which only grants leave in a minority of cases - a judicial review could likely have been completed in no more than five years1; a review of up to and including the Federal Court of Appeal could likely have been completed within three years;2\n\n\u2022 the fact that the governments of federal Canada and Nova Scotia rejected the Investors' application would not have precluded the courts from directly reviewing the prior report of the JRP;\n\n\u2022 the legal errors in the JRP Report that were identified by this Tribunal at the liability stage would have warranted a grant of relief by the courts of Canada. \"[T]he courts would likely have found the JRP's interpretation of CEAA and the NSEA to be unreasonable, and thus erroneous in law.\"3\n\n\u2022 the courts would also likely have identified as an error the JRP's failure to identify reasonable measures to minimize adverse effects.4\n\n\u2022 \"It is thus clear, in my opinion, that if the Claimants had made applications for judicial review of the JRP Report, the legal errors that the Tribunal identified in the JRP Report and recommendations would have warranted the grant of relief.\"5\n\n\u2022 the reviewing courts would have remitted the matter back for redetermination in accordance with the courts reasons.6\n\n\u2022 \"In order to avoid an appearance of bias as a result of a pre-judgment of the dispute, the reviewing courts would also have been likely to accede to a request from the Claimants that the JRP should be differently constituted for the redetermination, despite the additional costs and delays inherent in a remittal to new panel members.\"7\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 49.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 44.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 73.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 74.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 76.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 77.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 78.\n\n23.\n\nThe parties submitted different estimates of the costs of a judicial review and subsequent second JRP hearing. Canada proposes an overall figure of about one million dollars.8 The Investors submit it would have cost more, based on the assumption that only a small fraction of the material from the first JRP hearing could have been resubmitted.9 In light of the costs of the original JRP proceedings, and the relatively low costs of judicial review itself, it is clear that the overall costs of a judicial review and a regulatory do-over would not have been more than about three or four million dollars.\n\nJohn M. Evans, First Expert Report, para. 79.\n\nPaul Buxton, Second Witness Statement, August 18, 2017, paras. 46-47.\n\n24.\n\nThe cost of pursuing a judicial review and second hearing, therefore, was only at worst about one per cent of the profits that the Investors say they would have achieved over the life of the project.\n\n25.\n\nThe Investors could reasonably take into account, however, not only the costs of a judicial review and second JRP, but also the likelihood that this path would lead to a favourable outcome for the Investors.\n\n26.\n\nBased on the evidence of the Investors' experts in environmental law, and that of Mr. Evans, there was a strong likelihood that a court would have ordered a second hearing in front of a newly populated JRP.\n\n27.\n\nTrue, it is not possible to say with both precision and certainty what the outcome of a second environmental assessment process would have been. The original JRP Report did not express an opinion on some important issues, and a new JRP might have come to different conclusions on some other issues where the original JRP did opine. Participants at the new JRP could have submitted new evidence. It is not certain what mitigation measures that the new JRP would have proposed had it carried out its mandate of not only identifying potential adverse effects, but reasonable mitigation measures. The Governments of Nova Scotia and Canada might have considered additional information, and proposed different or supplemental measures to lessen environmental impact.\n\n28.\n\nThe law of Canada, however, is that administrative discretion must be exercised reasonably. The fact that the first environmental process went awry does not mean that there would have been departures from lawfulness and reasonableness on the part of a second JRP or by the governments of federal Canada and Nova Scotia after a second JRP Report.\n\n29.\n\nThe Investors' witnesses made it clear that after the treatment received in Nova Scotia, they had no confidence that a lawful and reasonable consideration would ensue if they pursued judicial review and a do-over of the permitting process. However disillusioned the directing minds of the Investors may have been with their treatment on the initial attempt to secure project approval, there were objectively many reasons for it to believe it had a reasonable prospect for success if it had pursued judicial review and a regulatory redetermination. These factors include:\n\n\u2022 according to the evidence of Mr. Evans, \"in my experience as a Judge of the Federal Court of Appeal, a second judicial review is rarely needed to correct legal errors in a fresh administrative process conducted following a successful challenge to a first decision. Nor am I aware that the administrative law literature has questioned the practical utility of court-ordered re-determinations. The Claimants provide no evidence to support their assertion that a second environmental assessment in this case would have been legally flawed\";10\n\n\u2022 the Investors had already prepared an extensive environmental impact statement;\n\n\u2022 even the JRP acknowledged that most of the environmental impacts that the JRP identified could be mitigated;\n\n\u2022 the policy of the Government of Nova Scotia was to encourage mining development;\n\n\u2022 as noted at length in the Tribunal's ruling on Article 1102 - concerning discriminatory treatment of the Investors - the legal approach taken by the JRP was exceptional compared to previous projects. The chair of the JRP in this case acknowledged the innovative nature of the approach it adopted. As the Investors demonstrated at the liability stage, particularly through evidence from Mr. Estrin, the legally mandated approach taken in reasonably comparable cases was for regulators to project impacts and propose mitigation measures. Even in cases where an area was environmentally sensitive and local communities were split in their initial view on the matter, environmental reviews and government decision makers identified ways to lessen or eliminate adverse effects and allowed the project to proceed.\n\n\u2022 in the context of arguing for \"lost profits over the lifetime of the project\", the Investors submitted evidence that if the JRP had not made the errors identified by the Tribunal, it was a virtual certainty that the project would have been approved on the first attempt. Mr. Estrin's submitted evidence, with his usual painstaking thoroughness and rigour of analysis, that include the following:\n\n\"First, it is standard practice in maritime Canada, and Nova Scotia in particular, for quarry and marine terminal environmental assessments to be approved, and not be rejected. Many such projects have been evaluated and the appropriate mitigation measures required to prevent likely SAEE are well known. In the period 2000-2016, no complete quarry or marine terminal EA application in Nova Scotia has been rejected, other than WPQ. All were approved with the use of essentially standard types of terms and conditions -including BPQ, a project much larger than WPQ. BPQ features an active quarry area more than twice the size of WPQ; has 4 times WPQ's rock reserves; will generate 4 times WPQ's annual aggregate production; will require blasting at full production on average about 4 days a week, compared to WPQ's full production blasting average of less than one blast every two weeks; and requires the use of nearly twice as many aggregate ships per year passing through commercial and indigenous fishery areas as WPQ. Also notable is that BPQ will require the irreversible destruction of a large area of wetland habitat, approximately 33 hectares (81 acres), an undoubtedly significant adverse environmental effect.\n\nSecond, no federal or provincial government agency or official took the position before the JRP that the WPQ should not be approved, nor did any assert that, considering mitigation, it would cause likely significant adverse environmental effects. The WPQ's predicted environmental effects were typical of similar projects which were approved. There was no reasonable basis to determine that WPQ would have different or more significant environmental effects with mitigation than other comparator projects.\n\nThird, the 2016 approval of the BPQ under CEAA and the Nova Scotia Environment Act (NSEA), importantly substantiates that even a mega quarry is approvable under the standard EA approach by Nova Scotia and Canada to these projects. The BPQ approval especially supports the conclusion that there would be no reasonable basis for the WPQ not to have been accepted. The WPQ EIS used similar EA methodology as that applied in BPQ and was even broader in content than the BPQ EIS. The types of potential environmental effects considered were similar in each case, although for BPQ, some effects would be more intensive and affect larger areas (e.g. noise, destruction of significant wetland areas and fish habitat). Strikingly, despite the differences in magnitude of effects, the EIS for each project predicted that residual effects on valued environmental components (VECs) after mitigation would be \"not significant\", and in some cases positive. The BPQ EIS arrived at its findings by applying similar mitigation measures as those proposed in the WPQ EIS.\n\nFourth, the JRP had no legitimate basis to recommend the project not proceed. The JRP did not find any residual SAEE likely to result within the definition and proper ambit of the CEAA. As this Arbitral Tribunal has found, community values and beliefs - CCV to the JRP - are not an \"environmental effect\" under NSEA or CEAA.\n\nFifth, there was no reasonable basis for either government to lawfully deny approval of WPQ.\n\nConsidering:\n\n(i) that no federal or provincial official or agency took the position that WPQ should not be approved;\n\n(ii) that no federal or provincial official or agency told the JRP that the WPQ would likely cause significant adverse \"environmental effects\" as defined in CEAA that could not be mitigated; nor did any of these officials state that WPQ would cause \"adverse effects\" or \"environmental effects\" as defined by the Nova Scotia Environment Act (NSEA) that cannot be mitigated;\n\n(iii) that the sole basis on which WPQ was referred by Canada to a JRP was potential environmental effects (i.e., fisheries), not public concern;\n\n(iv) the unequivocal standard Nova Scotia EA practice since at least 2000, being to issue approval under the NSEA for every complete EA application for a quarry or marine terminal; and\n\n(v) the unequivocal standard practice of the Governor General in Council (GIC) under CEAA in the period 2000-2013, being to approve every project that had received a positive recommendation from a CEAA or JRP,\n\nthe 2007 decisions by the GIC and Nova Scotia to deny approval of WPQ in these circumstances were unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory.\"11\n\nJohn M. Evans, Second Expert Report, para. 22.\n\nDavid Estrin, First Expert Report, paras. 7-11.\n\n30.\n\nMr. Estrin's evidence supports the view that after a successful judicial review, the Investors would also have had good grounds for optimism about the outcome of a \"do-over\" of the environmental assessment process. In light of the high probability of success in pursuing judicial review and in a do-over of the environmental permitting process, in my respectful view, the Investors cannot reasonably abandon the project and then claim all the potential massive profits from its long-term operation.\n\n31.\n\nAs noted in the Tribunal's Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, NAFTA damages and domestic remedies - when warranted by their own corpus of substantive law - can each play their own distinct role in securing justice for an investor. Judicial review in Canada might have mandated a do-over of the regulatory application process, but not have awarded damages. A Chapter 11 Tribunal can award damages, but not a do-over.\n\n32.\n\nThe Investors could have pursued both their domestic and NAFTA remedies. After their initial applications were rejected, had already sustained losses compensable under NAFTA - including millions of dollars spent participating in regulatory process that were not NAFTA compliant. If necessary to avoid missing the three-year deadline for filing a NAFTA claim, the Investors could have filed a notice under Chapter 11 even while still pursuing domestic remedies that included judicial review and a pursuant do-over of the regulatory approval process. Under Article 1121 of NAFTA, the Investors would have been required to waive any claim for damages under Canadian law. Judicial review in Canada, however, is in the nature of \"declaratory, injunctive or other extraordinary\" proceedings rather than a claim for monetary compensation.\n\n33.\n\nA NAFTA tribunal could then have managed its own deliberations and proceedings, including the timing of various steps, to take into account the proceedings in Canada. The Investors or Canada or both, might have requested the Tribunal at various points to wait, if practicable, for the outcome of various stages in Canada.\n\n34.\n\nEven if the Investors had eventually obtained regulatory approvals, the Investors might have still recovered damages under NAFTA. A compensatory award could have offset not only some unnecessary process costs in Canada but also lost profits due to delays in starting operations due to an initial regulatory assessment that was not NAFTA-compliant. If recourse in Canada had instead failed, the NAFTA tribunal could have been satisfied that the Investors had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate their losses. Then, depending on all the circumstances - including whether the regulatory do-over was itself non-compliant with NAFTA - the tribunal might have made a very large damage award involving projections of decades of lost profits.\n\n35.\n\nIf the Investors had pursued both the domestic and internal tracks for redress, the remedies provided in Canadian domestic proceedings under Canadian law would have been distinct and complementary to the remedies provided in NAFTA proceedings under international law. There would have been no unnecessary proliferation or duplication of proceedings at various levels. Rather, they would have instead worked together constructively.\n\n36.\n\nThe Investors chose to abandon the project rather than pursue domestic as well as NAFTA remedies. In that light, it is just that the Investors should recover the quantum of compensation that this Tribunal has awarded. It would not, however, be just that the Investors would obtain potentially tens of millions of dollars, even hundreds of millions of dollars for a project they did not further pursue.\n\n**V. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n37.\n\nMy opinion here is intended to complement the Tribunal's analysis by exploring a particular \"middle ground\" approach to damages. This approach would potentially have produced a different outcome than both the lost future profits proposal of the Investors and the lost investment costs proposal that Canada favoured in the event that any damages were awarded.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal has arrived at a compensation figure that is itself a \"middle ground\". Conceptually, it places a value on a lost opportunity, rather than confining compensation strictly to the investment costs in this case. The particular approach I have explored might have provided for far greater compensation. The mitigation of damages concern, however, places an upper bound on quantum in the context of my approach that is essentially the same as the figure determined by the Tribunal. In all the circumstances, I respectfully conclude that the Tribunal's result is both just and in accordance with the applicable principles of international law."}], "Content": "Award on Damages\n----------------\n\n**D****EFINED** **T****ERMS**\n-----------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **2002 GQP Formation** | Formation in 2002 of GQP as a result of a partnership agreement between Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Nova Stone |\n| **2004 GQP Buyout** | Sale by Nova Stone of its [REDACTED] in Global Quarry Products to Bilcon of Nova Scotia |\n| **2007** [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] to purchase the Whites Point Project from the Investors |\n| **Bickford Reply Statement** | Reply Witness Statement of Mr. George Bickford, dated 8 August 2017 |\n| **Blouin Report** | Expert Report of Dr. Tony Blouin, dated 9 June 2017 |\n| **Brattle Group Rejoinder** | Expert Rejoinder Report of Mr. Darrell B.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 5 February 2008, the Investors served upon the Government of Canada a Notice of Intent to submit a Claim to Arbitration (\"Notice of Intent\") in accordance with Articles 1116 and 1119 of the North America Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), alleging violations by the Respondent of its obligations under Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n7.\n\nOn 26 May 2008, the Investors filed a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") and NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1120. On 5 August 2008, the Parties agreed that the effective filing date of the Notice of Arbitration was 17 June 2008.\n\n8.\n\nThe Investors appointed Professor Bryan P. Schwartz as the first arbitrator. The Respondent appointed Professor Donald McRae as the second arbitrator. Following an invitation from the Parties, Judge Bruno Simma accepted to act as President of the Tribunal on 29 January 2009. The Parties confirmed the proper constitution of the Tribunal at the first procedural meeting, as recorded in Procedural Order No. 1 of 9 April 2009.\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 January 2009, the Investors filed their Statement of Claim.\n\n10.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, following a first procedural meeting with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, in which it fixed Toronto, Ontario, Canada as the place of arbitration and provided that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") would administer the arbitral proceedings, and provide registry services and administrative support.\n\n11.\n\nOn 4 May 2009, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defense.\n\n12.\n\nOn the same day, following a joint proposal by the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 providing guidance on the appropriate classification of confidential information. The Order also provided that any hearings would be open to the public except when necessary to protect confidential information.\n\n13.\n\nOn 11 May 2009, the Respondent applied for bifurcation of the proceedings between a liability phase and a damages phase. The Investors objected on 14 May 2009. On 3 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 ordering the bifurcation of the proceedings between jurisdiction/liability, on the one hand, and quantum, on the other hand. In the same Procedural Order, the Tribunal established principles for the taking of evidence in the present arbitration, including by making provisions for document production.\n\n**B. AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 July 2011, the Investors submitted their Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability.2\n\nEntitled \"Memorial of the Investors\".\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 December 2011, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability.3\n\nEntitled \"Government of Canada Counter-Memorial\".\n\n16.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Investors submitted their Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability.4\n\nEntitled \"Reply Memorial of the Investors\".\n\n17.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability.5\n\nEntitled \"Government of Canada Rejoinder\".\n\n18.\n\nThe Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits was held in Toronto from 22 October to 25 October 2013, and from 28 October to 31 October 2013. The Hearing was live-streamed on the website of the PCA, and the recordings remain available on the PCA's Case Repository.6\n\nAvailable at: https://www.pcacases.com/web/view/50.\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 March 2015, the Tribunal rendered an Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the dispositive part of which provides:\n\n742. In light of the foregoing, and having considered carefully the Parties' arguments and the evidence before it, the Tribunal,\n\na) In respect of Mr. William Richard Clayton, Mr. Douglas Clayton, Mr. Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc.,\n\ni. Unanimously decides that the Tribunal has jurisdiction insofar as these Investors base their claims on events occurring on or after 17 June 2005; the Respondent's jurisdictional objection is upheld insofar as the Investors base their claims on events occurring prior to that date;\n\nii. By majority vote decides that the Respondent has failed to accord to investments of these Investors treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, in breach of Article 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment);\n\niii. By majority vote decides that the Respondent has failed to accord to investments of these Investors treatment no less favorable than that it has accorded, in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors, in breach of Article 1102 (National Treatment);\n\nb) In respect of Mr. William Ralph Clayton, unanimously reserves its position as to whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an \"investor\" for purposes of NAFTA; accordingly, the Tribunal makes no decision in respect of the merits of the case in relation to him;\n\nc) Unanimously defers any decision on the quantum of compensation owed to the Investors as well as any decision on costs to a later stage of these proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nProfessor McRae disagreed with some of the Tribunal's findings and conclusions, and appended a dissenting opinion to the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n**C. DETERMINATION OF THE PROCEDURAL TIMETABLE ON DAMAGES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 29 May 2015, the Investors requested that a hearing be scheduled to establish the procedural calendar for the damages or quantum phase.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 June 2015, the Respondent filed an application to set aside the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (\"Set-Aside Application\") in the Federal Court of Canada. On 17 June 2015, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal stay the proceedings pending a decision of the Federal Court of Canada on the Set-Aside Application.\n\n23.\n\nHaving considered two rounds of submissions by the Parties regarding the Respondent's application for a stay, on 10 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 denying the application.\n\n24.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal advised that the Parties confer and provide their views on a possible pleading schedule for the quantum phase, the need for document production, and the likely duration of a hearing.\n\n25.\n\nOn 4 September 2015, in a joint letter, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed on a provisional pleading schedule, and considered that the required duration of the hearing would be between five and ten days.\n\n26.\n\nOn 15 September 2015, the Respondent submitted a motion requesting the Tribunal to consider the principles relevant to the quantification of damages and the scope of issues to be addressed in the damages phase as preliminary matters. The Tribunal's treatment of this subject as a preliminary matter, the Respondent contended, would serve to enhance the efficiency of the damages phase. The Investors requested that the Tribunal deny the motion, arguing that, should the motion be granted, they would be deprived of a full opportunity to present their case.\n\n27.\n\nOn 5 January 2016, having considered the Parties' views, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 ruling that the Arbitration shall proceed with a single, undivided quantum phase. Consequently, the Tribunal set out a procedural timetable, which was based on the Parties' agreed schedule contained in their joint letter dated 4 September 2015.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 January 2016, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal recalled the due dates for the document production phase at the quantum stage of the arbitration as they stood after the modifications of the procedural calendar in Procedural Order No. 20. According to the Tribunal's letter, the Parties were to exchange (i) document requests by 10 February 2016, (ii) objections to any document requests by 25 February 2016, (iii) responses to such objections by 11 March 2016, and (iv) replies to such responses by 21 March 2016.\n\n29.\n\nOn 16 March 2016, the Respondent requested an extension for the filing of replies to 29 March 2016, to which the Investors consented. On the same day, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request.\n\n30.\n\nOn 29 March 2016, having considered the Parties' view that further time was required to discuss outstanding objections, the Tribunal granted the Parties' request for a further extension to 11 April 2016.\n\n31.\n\nFollowing the Parties' correspondence regarding the steps to follow in the document production phase, on 28 April 2016, the Tribunal requested that the Investors submit by 11 May 2016 additional comments on the Respondent's objections provided in the Redfern Schedule dated 11 April 2016. On 3 May 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Respondent was allowed to revise its replies taking into account the Investors' comments by 18 May 2016.\n\n32.\n\nOn 6 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21, in which it decided on the Investors' requests for the production of documents to which the Respondent maintained its objections.\n\n33.\n\nOn 4 July 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and comment on the expected duration and the dates of the hearing.\n\n34.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, the Parties submitted their responses to the Tribunal's letter dated 4 July 2016. The Parties disagreed on the expected duration of the hearing. The Investors proposed that ten days be reserved for the hearing, whereas the Respondent suggested that five days should be sufficient.\n\n35.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, the Tribunal requested that the Parties hold two time periods in early 2018 in reserve, during which the hearing could be held.\n\n**D. WRITTEN PLEADINGS ON DAMAGES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nOn 7 November 2016, the Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement on the extension of the due dates for the first round of submissions on quantum. Accordingly, the time for the filing of the Investors' Damages Memorial and supporting materials was extended to 16 December 2016.\n\n37.\n\nOn 17 December 2016, the Investors' submitted their Damages Memorial. The Investors informed the Tribunal, however, that one further expert report would be submitted at a later stage. In addition, the Investors designated the Damages Memorial as confidential in its entirety.\n\n38.\n\nOn 12 January 2017, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal bar the Investors from filing the delayed expert report. Alternatively, should the Tribunal admit the report, the Respondent contended that the Tribunal should deem the Investors' Damages Memorial incomplete and suspend the subsequent deadline for the submission of the Respondent's Damages CounterMemorial.\n\n39.\n\nOn the same day, in a separate letter to the Investors, the Respondent contested the Investors' designation of the entire Memorial as confidential. The Respondent proposed that the whole document be deemed public should the Investors fail to provide a redacted version of the Damages Memorial. In addition, the Respondent asserted that the Investors had failed to provide all of the sources and evidence upon which their experts and witnesses relied in their reports and statements, and requested that such missing sources be provided.\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 February 2017, having considered the Parties' comments in relation to the delay in the Investors' filing of the expert report, the designation of the Investors' Damages Memorial as confidential, and the obligation to produce evidence relied upon in the submission, expert reports, and witness statements, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 resolving these procedural disputes. As for the first matter, the Tribunal requested that the Investors choose to either treat their submitted Damages Memorial as complete as it stood or, resubmit their Damages Memorial with the expert report. Should the Investors pursue the second option, the time period for the Respondent's submission of its Damages Counter-Memorial would be adjusted accordingly. As regards the second matter, the Tribunal ordered that the Investors provide a redacted version of the Damages Memorial by 6 March 2017. As to the third matter, the Tribunal ordered that the Investors provide the Respondent and the Tribunal with certain additional sources upon which their experts and witnesses had relied in their written reports and statements.\n\n41.\n\nOn 20 February 2017, the Investors informed the Tribunal that they had decided to resubmit the Memorial.\n\n42.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, the Investors resubmitted the Investors' Damages Memorial (\"Memorial\").\n\n43.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 23, in which it addressed the Parties' disagreement on the Respondent's request for the production of additional source documents relied upon by the Investors' experts and witnesses.\n\n44.\n\nOn 9 June 2017, the Respondent submitted the Government of Canada's Damages CounterMemorial (\"Counter-Memorial\").\n\n45.\n\nOn 14 August 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 24 addressing the Parties' disagreement on the production of additional source documents relied upon by the Respondent's experts and witnesses in their reports and statements.\n\n46.\n\nOn 23 August 2017, the Investors submitted the Investors' Reply Damages Memorial (\"Reply\").\n\n47.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, the Respondent submitted the Government of Canada's Damages Rejoinder Memorial (\"Rejoinder\")\n\n48.\n\nOn 30 and 31 January 2018, pursuant to Section 7.2 of Procedural Order No. 25 and the Tribunal's direction of 17 November 2017, the Parties submitted electronic copies of confidential and public (redacted) versions of every pleading, witness statement, expert report, and exhibit to the other disputing Party, the Members of the Tribunal, and the PCA. The PCA subsequently made the redacted version available to the public on its Case Repository.\n\n**E. SUBMISSIONS OF THE NAFTA NON-DISPUTING PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nOn 9 November 2017, following the receipt of the Respondent's Rejoinder, the Tribunal invited the NAFTA non-disputing parties to make any submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 by 21 December 2017.\n\n50.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that their request to extend the deadline to 15 January 2018 for their responses to any submissions from the NAFTA non-disputing parties had been granted.\n\n51.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the United States of America requested an extension to file its observations pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 on or before 31 December 2017. On 22 December 2017, the Tribunal granted the request.\n\n52.\n\nOn 31 December 2017, the United States of America filed its submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (\"United States' Submission\"), which notably addressed the application of NAFTA Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1); questions of causation; and the appropriate valuation date for compensation of NAFTA breaches.\n\n53.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Investors submitted their Response to the United States' Submission. The Respondent did not avail itself of the opportunity to submit any comments.\n\n**F. CONFIDENTIALITY DESIGNATIONS TO THE PARTIES' WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 31 October 2017, the Respondent submitted its objections to the Investors' confidentiality designations of their Memorial, Reply, expert reports and witness statements, and proposed a schedule according to which the Parties' disputes on confidentiality designations would be resolved.\n\n55.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, the Investors replied to the Respondent's letter of dated 31 October 2017, requesting the Tribunal to reject the Respondent's proposed schedule.\n\n56.\n\nOn 17 November 2017, the Tribunal established a schedule for the Parties to file objections to the confidentiality designations submitted by the other Party.\n\n57.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, the Investors submitted their reply to the Respondent's objections to the Investors' confidentiality designations of their Memorial, Reply, expert reports and witness statements.\n\n58.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 26, in which it identified the confidentiality designations of the Investors that it considered justified, and ordered that the Investors submit revised redacted versions of materials that were subject to blanket confidentiality designations.\n\n59.\n\nOn 13 December 2017, the Investors submitted revised redacted versions of all the materials that had been subject to blanket confidentiality designations.\n\n60.\n\nOn 15 December 2017, the Respondent submitted its proposed confidentiality designations to its Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder, expert reports, witness statements, and exhibits.\n\n61.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, the Investors submitted their objections to the Respondent's confidentiality designations.\n\n62.\n\nOn 19 January 2018, the Respondent filed its response to the Investors' objections to the Respondent's confidentiality designations.\n\n63.\n\nOn 26 January 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision on the confidentiality designations to the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder, expert reports, witness statements and exhibits.\n\n**G. ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE HEARING ON DAMAGES**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, following the filing of the Investors' Reply, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and advise the Tribunal on their preferred time period for the hearing, the number of hearing days that was required, and the location and venue of the hearing.\n\n65.\n\nOn 8 September 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal about points on which they agreed and points on which disagreement remained.\n\n66.\n\nOn 3 October 2017, in preparation for the hearing on damages, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and provide their views on a draft Procedural Order No. 25, addressing logistical and procedural aspects of the hearing.\n\n67.\n\nOn 20 October 2017, the Investors submitted a revised draft of Procedural Order No. 25 agreed by both sides, and in a separate letter the Respondent identified three points on which the Parties continued to hold different views, namely the amount of time to be reserved for rebuttal statements during the closing statements, the treatment of the Parties' presentation of new documents and the procedure for addressing potential disputes between the Parties concerning confidentiality during the hearing.\n\n68.\n\nOn 17 November 2017, having considered the Parties' further comments, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 25 addressing procedural aspects of the hearing, including those on which the Parties had been unable to reach agreement.\n\n69.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 25, the Parties sent the Tribunal a list of witnesses and experts they wished to cross-examine at the damages hearing.\n\n70.\n\nOn 17 January 2018, the Investors submitted a new Expert Report of Prof. Lorne Sossin (\"New Sossin Report\") and a new Expert Report of Mr. David Estrin (\"New Estrin Report\", and together with the New Sossin Report, \"New Expert Reports\"), which, according to the Investors, responded to the Expert Report of the Hon. Thomas Cromwell (\"Cromwell Report\") and the Witness Statement of Mr. Mark McLean (\"McLean Statement\"),7 both submitted with the Respondent's Rejoinder.\n\nExpert Report of the Hon. Thomas Cromwell, 6 November 2017 (\"Cromwell Report\") (**Ex. RE-17**); Witness Statement of Mr. Mark McLean, 6 November 2017 (\"McLean Statement\") (**Ex. RW-1**).\n\n71.\n\nOn 18 January 2018, the Respondent objected to the filing of the documents, as it was contrary to the procedure established in Procedural Order No. 20. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal reject the purported filing or, in the alternative, allow the Respondent the same amount of time in order to respond to the submissions, which would result in a postponement of the hearing.\n\n72.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal invited the Investors to provide any comments on the Respondent's objection and stated that, while this issue was not resolved, the New Expert Reports would not form part of the record and the Tribunal would refrain from reading them.\n\n73.\n\nOn 22 January 2018, the Investors made available for download a number of additional authorities and fact exhibits that they wished to include in the evidentiary record. On the same day, the Respondent objected to the filing, noting that several of those documents appeared to be annexes to the disputed New Expert Reports and reiterating its arguments in opposition to the admission of any new evidence shortly before the hearing. The Respondent requested the Tribunal not to open, review, or give any consideration to the documents until the question of their admissibility had been resolved.\n\n74.\n\nOn 24 January 2018, the Respondent submitted its response to the question of admissibility of the Investors' New Expert Reports and the additional documentary evidence. The Respondent objected to the admission of any new evidence on the basis that it would contravene the procedural rules established by the Tribunal and the due process rights of the Respondent. Therefore, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal deny the admission of such new evidence. If the Tribunal were to decide to admit it, the Respondent requested at least 60 days to submit further evidence in response to the New Expert Reports.\n\n75.\n\nOn 25 January 2015, the Investors replied to the Respondent's letter, arguing that, as a matter of procedural fairness, the Tribunal should consider all the relevant evidence. The Investors suggested that the Respondent's experts should be in a position to respond to the Investors' New Expert Reports within 21 days, such that the hearing dates could be maintained.\n\n76.\n\nOn 26 January 2018, the Tribunal denied the Investors' request for leave to file New Expert Reports, additional facts exhibits and additional authorities. Accordingly, those documents would not form part of the record. The Tribunal noted that it remained open to the Investors to critique the Cromwell Report and the McLean Statement at the forthcoming hearing in their opening and closing statements, and probe the strength of the McLean Statement during cross-examination. The Tribunal also decided that it remained open to the Investors to submit, by 29 January 2018, an application to the Tribunal to exclude specific statements in the Cromwell Report and the McLean Statement on the basis that they are unresponsive to the Investors' Reply Memorial.\n\n77.\n\nAlso on 26 January 2018, pursuant to Section 9.1 of Procedural Order No. 25, the Tribunal identified several issues and questions to which the Parties should give consideration during the hearing. Specifically, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider the following points (footnotes omitted):\n\n**Jurisdiction**\n\n1. The Tribunal recalls its decision in the 2015 Award to \"reserve[] its position as to whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an 'investor' for purposes of NAFTA; accordingly, the Tribunal makes no decision in respect of the merits of the case in relation to him\". Noting that no specific submissions have been made since the 2015 Award as to Mr. William Ralph Clayton's status as an investor, the Investors are invited briefly to confirm whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton continues to pursue any claim in the present arbitration.\n\n**NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117**\n\n2. Could Canada clarify the nature of its objection that the Investors' claim is \"impermissible\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 29) pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117? Does Canada consider that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim as brought; does Canada consider the claim inadmissible; or does Canada regard NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 as imposing substantive limitations as to the types of losses that the Investors can claim (and the Tribunal can award)?\n\n3. In light of the Parties' answers to Question No. 2, what is the relevance of pleadings or awards in previous NAFTA Chapter Eleven proceedings for the current proceeding, in which the Tribunal is to determine the amount of compensation due to the Investors following a finding of liability?\n\n4. Could the Parties please comment on the argument that \"barring the Investors' Article 1116 claim at this late stage, ten years later, would be grossly unfair to the Investors. Canada has raised this argument for the first time in its Counter-Memorial on Damages. Having failed to raise it in any way in the Jurisdiction and Liability phase of these proceedings, let alone at the outset, Canada ought now to be estopped from even raising the argument.\" Similarly, could the Parties please elaborate on the merits of the argument that the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117 is, at least in cases where the investment is wholly owned and controlled by the investors, a \"formality\".\n\n5. In light of the foregoing questions, do the Parties have any further comment on the appropriateness of permitting the Investors to amend their claim to ensure that the NAFTA Articles 1116/1117 issue is moot?\n\n**Causation**\n\n6. Considering the role of a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal, including vis-a-vis domestic courts, what is the appropriate approach of this Tribunal in assessing the likelihood that (i) an expert panel would have recommended approval of the Whites Point quarry and (ii) Ministers of the Canadian Government would have approved the project, in the event that the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal obligations under NAFTA?\n\n7. What is the consequence under NAFTA and/or general international law of factual uncertainty as to whether the damage would have occurred in the absence of a breach of international law? The Parties are invited to consider, in this regard, the holding of the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCIJ\") in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case, referred to by the Parties:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\n\nand the holding of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") in the *Genocide* case, referred to by the United States:\n\nThe question is whether there is a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act... and the injury suffered... Such a nexus could be considered established only if the Court were able to conclude from the case as a whole and with a sufficient degree of certainty that the [injury] would in fact have been averted if the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal obligations.\n\n8. Assuming a different (hypothetical) JRP process for the Whites Point project that was conducted on a basis which was compliant with NAFTA, what is the degree of certainty that such a JRP would have recommended the approval of the project? What hypothetical JRP recommendations, or government licensing conditions, should the Tribunal assume with respect to the mitigation of potential adverse effects of the project on the environment? Does this analysis lead to a conclusion that is different from the Investors' approach of focusing on the *existing* JRP Report with a deemed deletion of findings on community core values?\n\n**Mitigation**\n\n9. As a matter of international law, can the duty to mitigate damage extend to the pursuit of judicial review and renewed administrative proceedings in a situation where conduct in the same type of administrative proceedings has given rise to the breach of international law? How does the duty of reparation by \"re-establish[ing] the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if [the unlawful] act had not been committed\" relate to such a duty of mitigation?\n\n10. Assuming that a duty of mitigation through judicial review and administrative proceedings exists, what is the specific evidence on the record of bias on the part of the \"political, administrative and bureaucratic environment within which the Whites Point Quarry was considered\", which would render mitigation measures futile?\n\n**Valuation**\n\n11. In the event that the Tribunal were to conclude that the injury caused by the Respondent's NAFTA breaches is the loss of an opportunity, how should the value of such an opportunity be determined? What case law under public international law, if any, should guide the Tribunal in determining such value? What evidentiary standards should apply?\n\n12. The Tribunal notes that the Investors submit their valuation of damages exclusively on the assumption that the Tribunal will award lost profits, without presenting any calculations in the alternative. Should the Tribunal rule that lost profits are not recoverable in this case, what is the approach to be taken by the Tribunal? To what extent do the Investors disagree with the Respondent's valuation of mitigation costs, process costs, or investment costs set out in its written submissions?\n\n13. In the event that the Tribunal were to assume hypothetical JRP recommendations, or government licensing conditions, with respect to mitigating potential adverse effects of the project (*see* Question 8), how would such recommendations/conditions impact the costs, viability or profitability of the project?\n\n**H.

A viewing room, separate from the hearing room, to which the oral proceedings were live-streamed, was set up for the public.\n\n80.\n\nFollowing the examination of the Parties' witnesses and experts, pursuant to Section 9.2 of Procedural Order No. 25, the Tribunal indicated to the Parties that it did not see the need to identify any further issues and questions that the Parties should consider addressing in their closing statements, in addition to the issues and questions already put to the Parties in writing on 26 January 2018.\n\n81.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, the Investors informed the Tribunal that \"[w]ith regard to William Ralph Clayton, he withdraws his claim and does not continue to pursue any claim in the arbitration.\"8\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2438, lines 4-6.\n\n82.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed on modalities for implementing corrections to the transcript of the hearing and corrections to the scope of the portions of the transcript which one or both Parties had designated as confidential. On 1 May 2018, the Tribunal granted the Parties' request for an extension of the deadlines for such corrections to 11 May 2018.\n\n83.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, the Parties provided their list of corrections to the hearing transcripts, the majority of which were agreed upon. On 15 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the corrections agreed between the Parties and issued a decision in respect of one proposed amendment to the transcript that remained disputed between the Parties.\n\n84.\n\nOn 4 June 2018, the court reporter provided a corrected version of the transcript on the basis of the corrections agreed between the Parties and ordered by the Tribunal.\n\n85.\n\nFollowing further exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal, and the PCA, on 22 June 2018, the Parties provided the Tribunal with a final version of the transcript containing annotations to their opening and closing statements.\n\n86.\n\nOn 28 June 2018, the Parties provided the PCA with a public (*i.e.* redacted) version of the hearing transcript. The public version of the hearing transcript has been published on the PCA's Case Repository.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. THE INVESTORS' REQUESTS**\n------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Investors requested:\n\na) an order that Canada pay the Investors full reparation damages of US$ 443,350,772;\n\nb) all legal fees and disbursements, and the costs of this arbitration.9\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 255.\n\n88.\n\nNo formal request was contained in the Investors' Reply.\n\n89.\n\nAt the hearing, the Investors requested \"an award in the amount of the proven loss, with the tax equity adjustment needed to achieve full reparation.\"10\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2447, lines 7-10.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUESTS**\n--------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent requested an order:\n\na) dismissing the Claimants' damages claim in its entirety;\n\nb) awarding Canada its costs, with applicable interest, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1135(1) and Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules; and\n\nc) granting any other relief that may seem just.11\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 163.\n\n91.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent requested an order:\n\na) dismissing the Claimants' damages claim in its entirety;\n\nb) awarding Canada its costs, with applicable interest, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1135(1) and Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules; and\n\nc) granting any other relief that may seem just.12\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 184.\n\n92.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal \"dismiss the case.\"13\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2598, line 8.\n\n**IV. REPARATION FOR THE INJURY CAUSED BY THE INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn the present Award, the Tribunal considers the content of the Respondent's obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by its internationally wrongful acts, *i.e.* the Respondent's breaches of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal shall briefly address the legal standard of reparation under international law, including the applicable test for causation. The Tribunal shall then recall the breaches of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102 that it had determined in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability. On that basis, the Tribunal shall examine which injury, if any, of the Investors was caused by the Respondent's breaches of NAFTA. It falls to the Tribunal to determine which situation would have prevailed in the absence of the NAFTA breaches found in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability\u2014in other words, the applicable \"but for\" scenario. The Tribunal recalls that pursuant to NAFTA Article 1116, an investor is entitled to recover only damage incurred \"by reason of, or arising out of\" a breach.\n\n**A. LEGAL STANDARD OF REPARATION**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Investors submit that the principle that \"the state must make 'full reparation' to compensate for the loss caused by its conduct\", set out by the PCIJ's judgment in the *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* is applicable in determining the compensation that is due for the Respondent's violation of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102.14 The relevant part of the PCIJ's judgment reads:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it-such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation for an act contrary to international law.15 (Investors' emphasis)\n\nInvestors' Memorial, paras. 232-234, referring to *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes that \"under customary international law, Canada has to make full reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful acts\".22 The Respondent emphasizes, however, that \"[t]he principle of causation is an essential element of the obligation to make full reparation.\"23\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 167, lines 13-16.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 167, lines 16-17.\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the pronouncement in *Chorz\u00f3w* that \"reparation must as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\" as a general rule of international law.24 The implication of this test is that the Tribunal is \"by necessity engaged in a hypothetical exercise, not some alleged ordinary course exercise\"25 as alleged by the Investors. The Respondent emphasizes that the obligation to make full reparation applies only for losses caused by the specific breach or internationally wrongful act of a State26\u2014in the present case, the breach of NAFTA as identified by the Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 42.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2468, lines 21-23.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 42, referring to the Commentary to the ILC Articles, Article31, para. 9 (\"ILC Articles Commentary\") (**Ex. RA-60**).\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent submits that causation is a key element of the Investors' claim for compensation.27 According to the Respondent, it is \"a principle of customary international law that the claimant bears the burden of proving both the fact of the injury that it says it suffered as a result of a wrongful act, as well as the compensation to which it thinks it's entitled.\"28 Pursuant to Article 1116(1), it is the Investors' burden to prove that they have incurred loss \"by reason of, or arising out of\" the breach, *i.e.* that there is a \"sufficient causal link\" or an \"adequate connection\" between the breach and the loss as determined by several investment treaty tribunals.29 In other words, the damage must not be too indirect or remote *vis-a-vis* the breach.30\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 36, citing *Biwater Gauff*, para. 778 (**Ex.

CA-205**).\n\n102.\n\nIn support of its position, the Respondent also refers to Article 31 of the ILC Articles.31 The ILC Articles Commentary to Article 31 explains that \"the subject matter of reparation is, globally, the injury resulting from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences flowing from an internationally wrongful act.\"32 The Respondent argues that an approach that is consistent with the ILC Articles Commentary was adopted in *Biwater Gauff v. United Republic of Tanzania* and *Nordzucker AG v. Republic of Poland*. In particular, the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff* noted that \"'causing *injury'* must mean more than simply the wrongful act itself [...], otherwise the element of causation would have to be taken as present in every case,\"33 (Emphasis in original) and the tribunal in *Nordzucker* dismissed the claimant's claim for lost profits as it failed to prove that its loss was caused by the respondent's breach.34\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 42, citing *Chorz\u00f3w*, p. 47 (**Ex.

RA-130**).\n\n103.\n\nAs regards the *Lemire* award, the Respondent argues that it \"offers no relevant guidance to this Tribunal\" considering the difference between the breaches found in *Lemire* and in this arbitration.35 The *Lemire* tribunal held that the respondent in that case not only deprived the claimant of \"some chance to win\" a radio license36 but \"actually prevented the claimant from owning a radio license\" after it had won a tender.37 In contrast, the present Tribunal ruled that the Investors merely lost a fair opportunity to have their case considered and assessed.38\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, para. 56; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2582, referring to *Lemire* (**Ex. CA-325**); *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18), Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010 *(\"Lemire - Decision on Liability\")* (**Ex.

RA-153**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, para. 56.\n\n104.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues, the *Crystallex* award does not support the Investors' case. The tribunal in *Crystallex* held that, for Crystallex's claim for lost profits to be successful, it must prove that (i) \"it had engaged or *would have engaged* in a profitmaking activity but for the respondent's wrongful act, and that such activity would have indeed been profitable\" (Emphasis in original); and (ii) there is \"a reasonable basis to assess such loss of profits.\"39\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 113, quoting from *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2), 4 April 2016, paras. 875-876 (\"*Crystallex*\") (**Ex. CA-317**).\n\n105.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent submits that \"even where it can be established that an identified breach was a \"but for\" cause in the chain of causation, recovery of damages sought is not permitted unless the claimant can prove that \"the wrongful conduct was a *sufficient*, *proximate*, *adequate*, *foreseeable*, *or direct* cause of the injury.\"40 (Respondent's emphasis) Put differently, \"a claimant cannot be compensated 'for the deprivation of a right that it never possessed.'\"41 The Respondent adds that it is the Investors' burden to prove this causal link between the damage claimed by them and the breach of NAFTA obligations held in the Jurisdiction and Liability Award.42 According to the Respondent, the Investors have to prove \"not only causality and fact or factual causation but also what is often referred to as legal or proximate causation.\"43\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 45-46, citing S.

The United States' Article 1128 Submission**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe United States suggests that, as Articles 1116 and 1117 allow the recovery of loss \"by reason of, or arising out of\" a breach, the investor is required to demonstrate \"proximate causation\" between the loss and the breach.44\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 23.\n\n107.\n\nIn elaborating on the standard of proximate causation, which is \"an applicable rule of international law\"45 and has been endorsed by several NAFTA investment tribunals,46 the United States cites the ICJ decision in *Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro).* The ICJ held:\n\nThe question is whether there is a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the injury suffered [\u2026] Such a nexus could be considered established only if the Court were able to conclude from the case as a whole and with a sufficient degree of certainty that the [injury] would in fact have been averted if the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal obligations.47\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 25.\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 26, referring to *S.D.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThere is no substantive disagreement between the Parties as to the applicability, under NAFTA Chapter Eleven and in the present case, of the standard of full reparation set out by the PCIJ in its 1928 judgment in *Chorz\u00f3w.* The same standard has been laid down in Article 31 of the ILC Articles and adopted by NAFTA tribunals.48 Therefore, Article 31 is the starting point of the Tribunal's analysis:\n\n*Article 31 Reparation*\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\n\n*S.D. Myers I*, paras. 309-312 (**Ex. CA-313 / RA-65**); *Archer Daniels Midland Co. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05), Award, 21 November 2007, paras. 278-282 (**Ex. RA-3**); *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/1) Award, 30 August 2000 (\"*Metalclad*\"), para. 122 (**Ex. RA-41**). *See* Patrick Dumberry, The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: A Guide to NAFTA Case Law on Article 1105 (Kluwer Law International 2013), p. 301 (\"[NAFTA] tribunals have generally turned to customary international law [\u2026] to determine appropriate compensation in cases not involving expropriation. The starting point of their analysis is [\u2026] the *Chorzow Factory* case and the relevant provisions of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\") (**Ex. CA-312**).\n\n109.\n\nThe Parties however focus on different elements of that standard. While the Investors emphasize the content of the duty of reparation, namely that \"reparation must undo the harm caused by the breach and make the wronged party whole to the extent possible\",49 the Respondent underlines the requirement of causation, namely that any liability is limited to injury resulting from the NAFTA breaches identified by the Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability.50\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 25.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 42.\n\n110.\n\nAuthorities in public international law require a high standard of factual certainty to prove a causal link between breach and injury: the alleged injury must \"in all probability\" have been caused by the breach (as in *Chorz\u00f3w*), or a conclusion with a \"sufficient degree of certainty\" is required that, absent a breach, the injury would have been avoided (as in *Genocide*). While the facts of the *Genocide* case were of course markedly different from those underlying the present arbitration, there is an important similarity: the ICJ, as the Tribunal in the present case, was confronted with a situation of factual uncertainty, where in the view of one of the parties, the same injury would have occurred even in the absence of unlawful conduct.\n\n111.\n\nAn even stricter approach was established in *Nordzucker,* where the tribunal enquired whether the State's conduct \"necessarily\" led the investor to act in ways that harmed its profitability.\n\n112.\n\nThe case law also suggests that a distinction must be drawn between two aspects of quantum: first, whether causation between the unlawful act and the alleged injury has been established; and, secondly, assuming that such causation has been established, what the precise amount of the loss suffered is. As the *Crystallex* tribunal held:\n\n862. [\u2026] [I]n this arbitration, the actual issue is [...] a matter of proof of *the causal link* and of *the quantum* of the damage sustained [\u2026].51 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Crystallex*, para. 862 (**Ex. CA-317**).\n\n113.\n\nSimilarly, the *Lemire* tribunal ruled:\n\nOnce causation has been established, and it has been proven that the *in bonis* party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.52\n\n*Lemire*, para. 246 (**Ex. CA-325**).\n\n114.\n\nAs a threshold question, the Tribunal must first consider whether a causal link between the Respondent's breach of international law and any injury of the Investors has been established at all. In this regard, the test is whether the Tribunal is \"able to conclude from the case as a whole and with a sufficient degree of certainty\" that the damage or losses of the Investors \"would in fact have been averted if the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal obligations\" under NAFTA.53 Alternatively, the Tribunal must be convinced that the Investors' alleged injury would, \"in all probability\", not have occurred if the NAFTA violation had not been committed.54\n\n*Genocide*, para. 462 (**Ex. RA-012**).\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w*, p. 47 (**Ex. CA-327**).\n\n115.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal's analysis of causation in the specific circumstances of this case will proceed in two steps: it will, in a first step, identify the NAFTA violation by the Respondent, as determined by the Tribunal in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, before considering, in a second step, which injury (if any) suffered by the Investors ensued from this violation.\n\n**B. THE NAFTA BREACHES FOUND BY THE TRIBUNAL IN ITS AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Parties emphasize different aspects of the Tribunal's reasoning and disagree as to the scope of issues of fact and law that are to be considered *res judicata*. It is therefore incumbent upon the Tribunal to clarify the basis of the Respondent's liability before considering how the Investors would have stood in the absence of the NAFTA breaches by the Respondent.\n\n**1. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nAccording to the Investors, the Tribunal has already decided that the federal and Nova Scotia Ministers, relying upon the Joint Review Panel Report (\"JRP Report\"), disapproved the Whites Point quarry and marine facility project (\"Whites Point Project\") on the basis of \"community core values\", which is beyond the scope of the reviewing mandate of the Joint Review Panel (\"JRP\", and its reviewing process, \"JRP Process\") under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (\"CEAA\") and the Nova Scotia Environment Act (\"NSEA\").55 As a result, despite the Tribunal's ruling that \"the Ministers could have denied approval of the [q]uarry independently from the JRP's recommendation,\"56 the Investors argue that the Respondent is now precluded from raising in this quantum phase the argument that \"the Government decisions to reject the Whites Point project, not the JRP's acts that breached NAFTA, were the reason that the Whites Point project did not proceed\".57\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 305.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 307.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 309, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 59.\n\n118.\n\nRelying upon the Expert Reply Report of Mr. David Estrin (\"Estrin Reply Report\"), the Investors assert that \"[t]his Arbitral Tribunal previously found that the only 'significant adverse environmental effect' (SAEE) likely to arise from the [Whites Point Project] identified by the JRP was community core values - a factor with no legal relevance under applicable legislation,\" and that \"the JRP did not make any other findings of [significant adverse environmental effect], even though they referenced other potential environmental effects.\"58 In this respect, Mr. Estrin refers to part of the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability which states:\n\nThe [JRP] Report expressly identifies only one effect of the project as both significant and adverse, namely \"inconsistency with community core values\". With respect to other impacts of the project, the Panel allowed that \"with the effective application of appropriate mitigation measures, competent project management and appropriate regulatory oversight, most project effects should not be judged 'significant'.59\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 291, quoting from Expert Reply Report of Mr. David Estrin, 20 August 2017, paras. 79 (\"Estrin Reply Report\").\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 291, quoting from Estrin Reply Report, para. 7, which in turn cites Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 503.\n\n119.\n\nAccordingly, the Investors submit that, \"in the absence of significant adverse environmental effects that could not be mitigated, there was no lawful basis for the JRP not to recommend approval of the [q]uarry.\" Thus, \"but for Canada's breaches of the NAFTA, the Whites Point [q]uarry would have been approved and permitted.\"60\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 287.\n\n120.\n\nFurther, the Investors argue that the Tribunal's factual findings and legal conclusions are *res judicata*, and as such cannot be reargued.61 In this regard, the present case is no different from other arbitrations in which tribunals have made findings and conclusions in an earlier bifurcated phase of an arbitration.62 In respect of such findings and conclusions, the Tribunal is *functus officio*,63 and the principle of estoppel, which requires that the Parties be precluded from relitigating issues of fact and law already decided, applies.64 The Investors contend that allowing the Respondent to relitigate matters already decided would result in an abuse of process, as it would be contrary to the true purpose of bifurcation.65 In addition, it could lead to contradictory reasons and findings, which would consequently undermine the integrity of this arbitration.66\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 306, 316.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 329, citing Gaillard and Savage, eds, Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration, p. 741 (Wolter Kluwers 1999) (**Ex.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Investors' assertion that the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability has *res judicata* effect but objects to \"the erroneous characterization by the Claimants and Mr. Estrin of the issues actually decided in the Award.\"67 In this regard, the Respondent criticizes that the Investors seek to rely upon Mr. Estrin, an expert in Canadian environmental law, in support of their argument on the effect of *res judicata* under international law; Mr. Estrin's interpretation of the Tribunal's Award on Jurisdiction and Liability actually \"ha[s] nothing to do\" with his qualification as an independent expert on Canadian environmental assessment law.68\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 64.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 62.\n\n122.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's reading of the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal made two key findings.69 First, the Tribunal held that it was the JRP's approach in concluding the JRP Report that constituted breaches of NAFTA obligations.70 In other words, the JRP's \"failure to conduct the 'likely significant adverse environmental effects after mitigation'\" analysis and, instead, its resort to the consideration of community core values in excess of its mandate, were the basis of the Respondent's liability.71 Secondly, the Tribunal held that these violations resulted in the Investors' loss of a fair opportunity to have their Project justly assessed in accordance with domestic law.72 The Respondent highlights that, \"in finding fault with the JRP, the award made no determination as to what the outcome of the EA should have been and, again, nor could it have.\"73\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 166, lines 3-6.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 159, lines 16 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 50-55; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 166, lines 7-12.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 166, lines 13-17.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 165, lines 14-17.\n\n123.\n\nBased on such understanding, the Respondent argues that \"what is *res judicata* between the parties is that the JRP Report was incomplete and did not contain the information required by Canadian law.\"74 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that, in the Tribunal's causation or \"but for\" analysis, the Tribunal should consider \"(1) whether, in the but-for world, after analyzing 'the whole range of potential project effects', the JRP might have found other likely significant adverse environmental effects that could not be mitigated, or that might otherwise warrant a recommendation for rejection; and (2) with the JRP's mandate having been properly and fully discharged, how government decision-makers might have decided on the Whites Point Project.\"75\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 68. *See also*, Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, pp. 183 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 69.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nIn the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal held that the approach taken by the JRP breached Articles 1105 and 1102 of the NAFTA. In this second phase of the arbitral proceedings, the Parties have however characterized the Tribunal's analysis differently. The Tribunal will accordingly recall its findings in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, which in the Tribunal's view leave no doubt as to the basis of the Respondent's liability.\n\n**a. The JRP's Unprecedented Approach in respect of \"Community Core Values\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal concluded that the Whites Point Project was assessed in a manner that involved \"a fundamental departure from the methodology required by Canadian and Nova Scotia law.\"76 The reliance on \"community core values\" was a \"distinct, unprecedented and unexpected approach taken by the JRP\".77 The Investors were \"not treated in a manner consistent with Canada's own laws, including the core evaluative standard under the CEAA and the standards of fair notice required by Canadian public administrative law\".78\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 600.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 601.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 602.\n\n126.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concluded that \"the Investors and their investment were not afforded a fair opportunity to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided in accordance with applicable laws\" in the context of the environmental assessment (\"EA\").79 \"The Tribunal's respectful conclusion is that in all the particular and unusual circumstances of this case, the Investors were denied an expected and just opportunity to have their case considered on its individual merits.\"80\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 603.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 741.\n\n127.\n\nIn taking issue with the unprecedented approach of the JRP, the Tribunal however recognized that socio-economic considerations may in principle be included within the scope of any valid assessment: \"social impacts can be within the scope of a valid assessment. Furthermore, the value placed by members of a community on distinctive components of an ecosystem can be taken into account in an assessment under the laws of Canada and Nova Scotia.\"81\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 601.\n\n**b. The JRP's Failure to Analyze \"Likely Significant Effects after Mitigation\"**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that, pursuant to section 16 of the CEAA, the JRP was legally obliged to report on all factors mentioned there, including mitigation measures.82 The Tribunal concluded:\n\n[T]he JRP was, regardless of its \"community core values\" approach, still required to conduct a proper \"likely significant effects after mitigation\" analysis on the rest of the project effects. By not doing so, the JRP, to the prejudice of the Investors, denied the ultimate decision makers in government information which they should have been provided.83\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 546.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 535.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal reviewed other projects that were similar to the Whites Point Project in some or several aspects and were subject to an EA by a JRP. The JRP reports of all these other projects complied with the legal standard of the CEAA in identifying likely significant adverse effects and proposing mitigation measures. Unlike the JRP for the Whites Point Project, all other JRPs addressed the \"likely significant adverse effects after mitigation\" of the project under assessment.84\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, paras. 697, 708.\n\n**c. No Prejudgment by the Tribunal as to Approval or Approvability of Project**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal finally made it clear that it was not conducting, in the present proceedings, \"its own environmental assessment, in substitution for that of the JRP.\"85 Therefore, it was not for the Tribunal to decide \"what the actual outcome should have been, including what mitigation measures should have been prescribed if the JRP had carried out the mandate contained in applicable laws\".86\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 602.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 602.\n\n131.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal did not prejudge the decision that should have been adopted by the decision-makers in Nova Scotia and federal Canada on the basis of the JRP Report. The Tribunal limited itself to the finding that \"the decision-makers in Nova Scotia and federal Canada had the authority and duty to make their own decision about the future of the Bilcon project.\"87\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 584.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that \"the Investors and their investment were not afforded a fair *opportunity* to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided in accordance with applicable laws\".88 This was again emphasized in the Tribunal's concluding statement at the very end of its Award: \"The Tribunal's respectful conclusion is that in all the particular and unusual circumstances of this case, the Investors were denied an expected and just opportunity to have their case considered on its individual merits\".89\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 603 (Emphasis in original).\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 741.\n\n**C. INJURY PROVEN TO BE CAUSED BY CANADA'S NAFTA BREACHES**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal shall now turn to the situation that would have prevailed \"in all probability\" or \"with a sufficient degree of certainty\" had these breaches of NAFTA not occurred. Based on the Tribunal's findings in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, there is no disagreement between the Parties that the Investors, as a result of the NAFTA breaches identified by the Tribunal in that Award, lost a fair opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. The Parties disagree, however, as to whether the Investors have proven any injury beyond that with the required degree of certainty.\n\n134.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal will briefly review the \"but for\" scenarios discussed by the Parties. The principal bone of contention between the Parties is the likelihood that, but for the NAFTA breaches, the Whites Point Project would have obtained all relevant regulatory approvals. The Investors assert that \"but for Canada's breaches of the NAFTA, the Whites Point [q]uarry would have been approved and permitted and would have produced and shipped stone.\"90 In contrast, the Respondent argues that there was no certainty that the Whites Point Project would have been approved but for the breach.91 In other words, it is entirely possible that the same outcome would have obtained even in the event that an EA had been conducted on a basis that was consistent with NAFTA.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 287.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 38.\n\n135.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, the following stages of project approval can be distinguished: (i) assessment of the Whites Point Project by a JRP; (ii) assessment of and approval decision with regard to the Whites Point Project by Ministers at the federal and Nova Scotia levels on the basis of the report of the JRP; and (iii) subsequent industrial approvals. It is only after completion of these steps that the Investors' Whites Point Project could have been built and operated.\n\n**1. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAccording to the Investors, but for the Respondent's breaches of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102, the Whites Point Project \"would have been approved and permitted and would have produced and shipped stone.\"92\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 215; Investors' Reply, para. 287.\n\n137.\n\nThe Investors rely on the Estrin Reply Report to explain that the JRP Report identified the Whites Point Project's inconsistency with community core values as the only significant adverse environmental effect.93 As a result, given the Tribunal's ruling that the JRP's consideration of community core values was beyond the scope of the JRP's mandate under Canadian law, according to the Investors, the Tribunal should treat the JRP Report as if no assessment of community core values had been made. In other words, the Investors suggest, the Tribunal should assume \"that the JRP report satisfied the requirements of CEAA and that additional information was not required in order to make a decision.\"94 Since the JRP Report \"offered no other reason to reject the project, the JRP would otherwise have logically been compelled to recommend approval of the Whites Point [q]uarry.\"95 Contrary to the Respondent's argument, the Investors contend that leaving the concept of community core values out of the JRP Report would not have rendered the Report incomplete, as the JRP itself noted in its Report that \"it did have sufficient information to fulfill its mandate.\"96\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 291, referring to Estrin Reply Report, para. 7; Investors' Memorial, para. 215, citing Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 535.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 292, referring to Estrin Reply Report, paras. 18-19.\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 217.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 292.\n\n138.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Investors add that the Whites Point Project complied with all the relevant requirements of the federal and Nova Scotia EA processes, particularly since \"with ordinary mitigation there would have been no significant adverse environmental impact.\"97 To explain the compliance of the Whites Point Project with relevant Canadian environmental law in detail, the Investors refer to the Estrin Reply Report, in which Mr. Estrin argues that \"[t]his Arbitration Tribunal previously found that the only 'significant adverse environmental effect' (SAEE) likely to arise from the [Whites Point Project] identified by the JRP was community core values.\"98 He thus concludes that \"it is irrelevant for the Tribunal in this phase of the proceedings to now consider possible further reasons as to why the project might cause [significant adverse environmental effects].\"99 Therefore, if community core values had been \"excluded as a relevant criterion, there would have been no reasonable basis to conclude that all EA requirements had not been satisfied.\"100\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 218; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 109, lines 18-21.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 291, referring to Estrin Reply Report, para. 7.\n\nEstrin Reply Report, para. 10.\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 218.\n\n139.\n\nIn comparison to other precedents involving environmental approval in Nova Scotia, the Investors note that \"before the Whites Point [q]uarry, there was no project of any kind assessed by a CEAA review panel that was not ultimately approved.\"101 In this regard, the Investors cite Mr. Estrin's testimony during the hearing:\n\n[The mitigation measures of] Whites Point, Black Point, Aguathuna, [...] were essentially similar. That's another reason why it can be objectively determined that there isn't really anything unique about Whites Point that would stand in the way of some approvability except politics. The Black Point Quarry is a much larger quarry than Whites Point, would be much more blasting, much larger, much more shipping, all of those things. In the result, [the decision-makers] came up with mitigation measures that were ones that Bilcon itself had anticipated were required ten years ago because of all the expertise that they had involved.102\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 91 line 14 - p. 92, line. 13.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2394, line 17 - p. 2395, line. 20.\n\n140.\n\nAs for the decision-making at the government level, the Investors explain that the federal Minister of Environment and the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment are responsible of approving the Whites Point Project, pursuant to the CEAA and the NSEA, respectively. However, neither can exercise its authority without legal constraints, such as the rule of l aw.103 That is, any exercise of discretion must be carried out in accordance with the legislative purpose, which in this case \"is to balance environmental protection and economic development.\"104 Given the absence of any other significant adverse environmental effects found in the JRP Report, the Investors argue that the Ministers at the federal and provincial levels would have had no reasonable basis for refusing the approval of the Whites Point Project.105 On this point, the Investors refer to the Expert Reply Report of Prof. Sossin (\"Sossin Reply Report\"), in which Prof. Sossin takes the following view:\n\n[W]here there is no evidence of such significant adverse environmental effects, a Minister does not retain discretion to nevertheless deny approval to a project. There is no corresponding phrase in section 37(1)(b) of CEAA that says something along the following lines: \"if a project will not have significant adverse environmental effects, a refusal can nonetheless be justified in the circumstances.\". If the project does not give rise to significant adverse environmental effects, in other words, there is no provision in CEAA that would allow the Responsible Authority (\"RA\") (or GIC [Governor in Council]) to turn it down for reasons of political expediency, policy preference, economic reasons, or in response to public opposition.106\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 219, 220; Investors' Reply, para. 294, citing *Reference re Secession of Quebec*, [1998] 2 SCR 217, paras 70-71 (**Ex. CA-816**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 98, line 25 - p. 99, line 2; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2409, line 22 - p. 2410, line 9, referring to the Purpose section and Section 2 of the NSEA.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 297-299, citing Expert Reply Report of Prof. Lorne Sossin, 3 August 2017, paras 2223, 62 (\"Sossin Reply Report\"); Investors' Memorial, para. 218; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2402, line 24 - p. 2403, line 5.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 298, quoting from Sossin Reply Report, para. 22.\n\n141.\n\nThe Investors refer to Canadian administrative jurisprudence on the rule of law to assert that, for their exercise of power to be lawful, the public authorities have an obligation to consider all relevant factors and discard all irrelevant ones.107 Accordingly, there was \"no lawful basis in the circumstances on which Ministers could lawfully deny environment approval.\"108 Relying on the Expert Report of Prof. Sossin and the Sossin Reply Report, the Investors submit that, in the present case, \"there was no basis on which the [M]inisters, acting reasonably, could have lawfully denied regulatory approval of the Whites Point [q]uarry.\"109 As such, the Investors conclude that the Ministers could only have approved the Whites Point Project.110\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 224\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 225.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 97 lines 9-13, referring to the Expert Report of Prof. Sossin, 10 December 2016; and Sossin Reply Report.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 298-99.\n\n142.\n\nThe Investors also highlight stipulations made by the Respondent in the document production phase of the present Arbitration and in an earlier undertaking made by the Government of Nova Scotia during the JRP hearings to the effect that there are no records of projects that did not receive the granting of industrial permits after having obtained environmental approval. In particular, the undertaking states that the Government of Nova Scotia had \"no record of any project that had received an Environmental Assessment approval, but was subsequently denied approval under Part V [Industrial Permits] of the Environment Act.\"111 The relevant stipulations submitted by the Respondent in this arbitration are:\n\n**Request 37:** Canada stipulates that it has no examples where a proponent of a project which received environmental assessment approval from the Government of Canada (under the version of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act applicable to the Whites Point EA), and applied to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Transport Canada, or Natural Resources Canada for any permits, licences or authorizations required for the operation of the project, was denied those permits, licenses or authorizations.\n\n**Request 38:** Canada stipulates that it has no examples where a proponent of a project which received Nova Scotia environmental assessment approval, and completed applications for Part V approval and/or other relevant permits, licences or authorizations required for the operation of the project, was denied that approval or those permits, licences or authorizations.112\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 228, quoting from List of Undertakings, Public Hearings of 16 June to 30 June 2007 (Ex. C-550); Expert Report of GHD Limited (Peter Oram), 6 December 2016, p. 5 (\"GHD Report\").\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 228.\n\n143.\n\nThe Investors therefore conclude that, in the ordinary course, after obtaining environmental approval, Bilcon of Nova Scotia's applications for all necessary permits to build and operate the Whites Point Project would have been granted by the Nova Scotia Ministry of the Environment.113\n\nInvestors' Memorial, paras. 227-231; Investors' Reply, paras. 300-303, referring to Estrin Reply Report, paras. 265, 300-301, 320-322; GHD Report, p. 4; Reply Witness Statement of Mr. Paul Buxton, 18 August 2017, para. 9 (\"Buxton Reply Statement\"); Expert Reply Report of SNC-Lavalin (Bill Collins), 14 August 2017, pp. 1-2 (\"SNC Reply Report\"); Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 121, lines 3-12.\n\n144.\n\nSummarizing their case on causation, the Investors conclude that \"[b]ut for Canada's breach, the JRP would, in the ordinary course, have recommended approval. The Ministers would, in the ordinary course, have granted approval. And the industrial permits necessary for operation would, in the ordinary course, have been issued. The evidence proves beyond the required - far beyond the required - balance of probabilities a direct causal link between the breach and the [I]nvestors' loss of the Whites Point project.\"114\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2391, lines 12-21.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the breach of NAFTA found by a majority of the Tribunal did not cause the damages sought by the Investors.115 In particular, the Respondent argues that it was the Governments' decisions, not the JRP's acts constituting the NAFTA breach, which \"were the reason that the Whites Point project did not proceed.\"116\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 58.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 59.\n\n146.\n\nThe Respondent adds that it is not the function of this Tribunal to determine what the Governments' decisions should have been but for the breach,117*i.e.* whether they should have issued all necessary approvals and permits so that the Whites Point Project could proceed.118 In this regard, the Respondent cites the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, in which the Tribunal stated:\n\nThis Tribunal also wishes to be very clear that it has not purported in these reasons to conduct its own environmental assessment, in substitution for that of the JRP. The Tribunal at this stage simply holds that the applicant was not treated in a manner consistent with Canada's own laws, including the core evaluative standard under the CEAA and the standards of fair notice required by Canadian public administrative law. The Tribunal is not here deciding what the actual outcome should have been, including what mitigation measures should have been prescribed if the JRP had carried out the mandate contained in applicable laws.119\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 60.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 61.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 60, referring to Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 602.\n\n147.\n\nIn the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Respondent notes, the Tribunal clearly determined that the Investors merely lost the fair opportunity to have their Project considered, assessed and decided in accordance with applicable laws.120 In other words, the Investors \"never had an approved and operating project. Nor did they have the right to one, even absent the NAFTA breach,\"121 given that the Tribunal ruled in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability:\n\nThe basis of liability under Chapter Eleven is that, after all the specific encouragement the Investors and their investment had received from government to pursue the project, and after all the resources placed in preparing and presenting their environmental assessment case, the Investors and their investment were not afforded a fair *opportunity* to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided in accordance with applicable laws.122 (Respondent's emphasis)\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 61.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 54.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 61, referring to the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 603.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Investors for asking the Tribunal to \"reverse the majority's circumscribed decision in the jurisdiction and liability phase, and to now act as the JRP, the Nova Scotia government, and the federal government in order to issue the approvals and permits that would have been necessary for the Whites Point project to proceed.\"123 According to the Respondent, \"[t]o award the Claimants lost profits on the basis that the project was permitted and operating would be simply inconsistent with the findings in the Award and would compensate the Claimants for the deprivation of a right that they never possessed.\"124\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 61.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 61.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that a NAFTA tribunal \"is not equipped to assume the role of both the JRP and government decision-makers.\"125 It adds that if domestic courts are not allowed to assess the possibility of a certain outcome in a flawed regulatory review, there is no reason why a NAFTA tribunal should have that power.126\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 176, lines 19-21.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 178, lines 15-23.\n\n150.\n\nHaving emphasized that it is inappropriate for the Tribunal to speculate about possible government decisions that would have been taken but for the breaches,127 the Respondent subsequently analyzes the Investors proposed \"but for\" scenario and contends that the following assumptions on which it is based are flawed: (i) that the JRP would have submitted a report with findings and recommendations in favour of approving the Whites Point Project; and (ii) that the government decision-makers would have approved the Whites Point Project.128\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 179, lines 1-10.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 62.\n\n151.\n\nIn considering these two assumptions, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal must follow \"the guidance of authorities\" such as the PCIJ's judgment in *Chorz* \u00f3 *w* (*i.e.* \"in all probability\") and the ICJ's judgment in *Genocide* (*i.e.* \"sufficient degree of certainty\").129 These authorities thus establish a test that requires a conclusion with a sufficient degree of certainty; according to the Respondent it is up to the Investors to show that this certainty exists.130 In applying these standards, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal will find \"the injury alleged by the [Investors] far too remote to serve as the basis for Canada's reparation obligation, and any one of the [steps, hurdles and events in play here] could also break an alleged chain of factual causation.\"131\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 180, line 3 - p. 181, line 24; *see* Section IV(A)(2) above.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 181, lines 22-24.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 182, lines 9-15.\n\n152.\n\nRegarding the first assumption (that the JRP would have submitted a report with findings and recommendations in favour of approving the Whites Point Project), the Respondent states that the Investors' expert, Mr. Estrin, \"overlooks the requirements of the Nova Scotia EA regime\" and \"ignores the evidence in the JRP's public EA record and the many findings and conclusions in the JRP Report which provided a reasonable basis for the JRP to have made recommendations that would not be supportive of project approval.\"132\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 63.\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with Mr. Estrin's assessment that the Whites Point Project should have been approved given the lack of input from government officials that the Whites Point Project would cause significant adverse environmental effects. Government submissions, the Respondent contends, are only part of the whole information needed to be considered by the JRP.133 Particularly, the JRP works independently and its resolution does not hinge exclusively upon information or opinions submitted by the Government.134\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 72-74.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 73-74.\n\n154.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that Mr. Estrin's approach of comparing findings in different review processes is inappropriate, as each review is context-specific.135 In any case, should the JRP be compelled to consider the findings of other projects, the Respondent contends that none of them would be appropriate comparators \"due to the differences in the predicted environmental effects of each project.\"136 This is particularly so in this case due to the uniqueness of the Whites Point Project, as \"its proposed site was in a highly sensitive area, which included the presence of an endangered population of North Atlantic right whales and a highly valued lobster fishery.\"137\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 75-78.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 79.\n\n155.\n\nInstead, the Respondent refers to the Expert Report of Dr. Tony Blouin (\"Blouin Report\") and the Expert Report of Ms. Lesley Griffiths (\"Griffiths Report\") in support of its position that the JRP's findings on bio-physical and socio-economic effects of the Whites Point Project would have reasonably resulted in an inclusion of adverse, or likely or potential adverse, environmental effects in the JRP Report.138 Dr. Blouin focused on the precepts of the NSEA, while Ms. Griffiths focused on the approach under the CEAA.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 63-67, referring to Expert Report of Dr. Tony Blouin, 9 June 2017 (\"Blouin Report\") (**Ex. RE-2**); Expert Report of Ms. Lesley Griffiths, 9 June 2017 (\"Griffiths Report\") (**Ex. RE-1**); Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 70, 82.\n\n156.\n\nWith regard to the CEAA, the Respondent relies on the testimony of Ms. Griffith for the proposition that \"but for\" the NAFTA breach it does not follow that the JRP Report would have provided findings and results, supportive of the Whites Point Project's approval. In fact, \"the JRP could have reasonably concluded that the project would have likely resulted in significant adverse environmental effects on the right whale and the lobster, taking into account proposed mitigation.\"139\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 192, lines 14-18.\n\n157.\n\nWith regard to the NSEA, the Respondent refers to the observation of Dr. Blouin that the JRP Report had found that the Whites Point Project would have an adverse environmental effect or likely or potential adverse environmental effect on several valued ecosystem components. These results could have led to a recommendation not to approve the Whites Point Project. Thus, but for the NAFTA breach, the Whites Point Project may not have been approved pursuant to the NSEA.140\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 192, line 19 - p. 193, line 8.\n\n158.\n\nBoth experts discuss the effect of the Whites Point Project on endangered marine mammals, such as the North Atlantic right whale and the American lobster, and on the coastal wetland.141 On the basis of this expert evidence, the Respondent contends that \"it would be impossible to conclude with confidence that absent the NAFTA breach, a review panel would find no likely significant adverse environmental effects from the Whites Point Project.\"142\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 68-71, referring to Blouin Report (**Ex. RE-2**) and Griffiths Report (**Ex. RE-1**); Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 79.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 71.\n\n159.\n\nRegarding the second assumption (that the government decision-makers would have approved the Whites Point Project), the Respondent contends that provincial and federal decision-makers have discretionary authority to decide on the approval of the Whites Point Project.143 They make decisions by taking into account a broad range of environmental effects, especially socio-economic conditions,144 and the JRP Report is but one of the sources on which these decisionmakers rely, besides staff assessments and public comments.145\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 83; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 83.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 77.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 74, referring to Report of Mr. Peter Geddes, 9 June 2017, para. 24 (\"Geddes Report\") (**Ex. RE-4**); Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 87.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Sossin Reply Report is flawed on several grounds. First, it is based on the incorrect premise that, if findings on community core values had been excluded, the JRP would not have found any other significant adverse environmental effects. Rather, the JRP Report should be deemed deficient, as the JRP did not properly carry out its mandate, and a new evaluation must be made.146\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 84-85.\n\n161.\n\nSecondly, relying on the Cromwell Report and Expert Rejoinder Report of the Hon. John M. Evans (\"Evans Rejoinder Report\"), both written by former Canadian judges, the Respondent argues that Prof. Sossin fails to acknowledge the broad discretion the Government has as long as its decision is based on a reasonable ground in the applicable law.147 Moreover, the Respondent concludes from the oral testimony of Mr. Robert G. Connelly that, pursuant to the CEAA, \"it was very clear no department, no minister wanted to give an environmental assessment panel the authority to make decisions. They wanted these panels to be advisory.\"148\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 87-88, referring to Cromwell Report; Expert Rejoinder Report of the Hon. John M. Evans, 6 November 2017, paras. 62-65 (\"Evans Rejoinder Report\") (**Ex. RE-14**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2478, lines 19-24.\n\n162.\n\nLastly, absent the JRP's findings on community core values, the JRP Report would be incomplete, and \"the Ministers would likely seek additional information from the JRP, or ask it to reconvene and complete its mandate.\"149\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 89, citing Cromwell Report, paras. 61-62 (**Ex. RE-17**); Expert Rejoinder Report of Mr. Robert G. Connelly, 6 November 2017, para. 15 (\"Connelly Rejoinder Report\") (**Ex. RE-11**).\n\n163.\n\nOn the basis of this expert evidence, the Respondent concludes that there is no \"but for\" scenario under which the Government would be legally required to approve the Whites Point Project: in the event that \"references to 'community core values' are simply excised from the JRP Report and that the rest of the report remains unchanged,\"150 as the Investors suggest, the government decision-makers would send the Report back for clarification or would request additional information, because it would lack a conclusion regarding possible significant adverse environmental effects as mandated by the CEAA.151 If the JRP were subsequently to conclude that \"certain project effects were likely significant adverse environmental effects,\" it would be reasonable for the Government to reject the approval of the Whites Point Project.152 Alternatively, if the JRP found no likely significant adverse environmental effects, the \"JRP report [would not be] binding on the [Government]\", and the CEAA \"imposes no restrictions' on the [Government's] exercise of its discretion.\" The Government can thus \"reject a panel's findings and recommendations.\"153\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 81.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 81; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 89; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 198 lines 1-6, citing Expert Report of Mr. Robert G. Connelly, 9 June 2017, para. 89 (\"Connelly Report\") (**Ex. RE-3**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 82; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 90.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 88.\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent, relying upon the Expert Report of Mr. Robert G. Connelly (\"Connelly Report\"), argues that, pursuant to CEAA, the Governor in Council (the ultimate decision-maker at the federal level) \"could still have reasonably denied approval to the Whites Point Project\" and that with the conclusions on community core values excised, the JRP Report would lack conclusions on significant adverse environmental effects and accordingly become deficient.154 In any case, the Respondent argues the Governor in Council is not legally bound to follow the JRP's findings, as the JRP's role is merely to gather information. Rather, the Governor in Council has to take into account various policy considerations and can consider additional material not addressed by the JRP.155 Therefore, it is uncertain that, but for the NAFTA breaches, the Governor in Council would have approved the Whites Point Project.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 196, line 21 - p. 198, line 6, referring to Connelly Report, paras. 8889 (**Ex. RE-3**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 199, line 14 - p. 201, line 14, referring to Evans Rejoinder Report, paras. 62-65 (**Ex. RE-14**); Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2472, line 9 - p. 2473, line 9.\n\n165.\n\nAs regards decision-making at the Nova Scotia level under the NSEA, the Respondent asserts that the Nova Scotia Minister of the Environment as the ultimate decision-maker \"can take into account a wide range of considerations so long as they are relevant, having regard to the purposes of the NSEA,\"156 and the JRP Report is only one element in such considerations.157 In exercising this decision-making function, the Respondent notes that the Minister has broad discretion in evaluating the environmental effects of a project under review.158 Referring to the Expert Report of Mr. Peter Geddes (\"Geddes Report\"), the Respondent explains that there is no standard EA practice. As such, \"[g]overnment reviewers, may raise issues, identify means of mitigation, or suggest that there is inadequate information.\"159 \"[T]he minister must look at the entire picture, which includes the definition of environmental effect, the overall principle of balancing economic development with environmental sustainability and the positive or adverse effects of a project. And at the end of the day, the minister is the final decision maker regardless of the recommendation that's put before him or her.\"160 In addition, should the Minister find a JRP Report incomplete, the Minister could \"direct the JRP to fulfil its mandate.\"161\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 201, line 14 - p. 202, line 6.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 202, line 18 - p. 203, line 7, referring to Geddes Report, para. 52 (**Ex. RE-4**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 205, line 9 - p. 206, line 11, citing Cromwell Report, para. 50 (**Ex.

RE-17**).\n\n166.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent submits that \"the degree of certainty that such a [NAFTA-compliant] process would result in [a JRP's] positive recommendations and positive [government] decisions is [zero],\"162 and therefore the NAFTA breach previously found by the majority did not cause the loss of profits claimed by the Investors.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018 p. 208, lines 11-14. *See* Slide 95 of the Respondent's Opening PowerPoint Presentation.\n\n167.\n\nGiven the Investors' refusal to present other alternative claims, the Respondent thus requests that the Tribunal award the Investors no damages.163 This approach, the Respondent argues, was adopted by the tribunal in *Nordzucker*.164\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 84; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 155, line 23 - p. 156, line 17, p. 212, line 7-10.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 84-85, referring to *Nordzucker*, paras. 65-66 (**Ex. RA-130**).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nApplying the standards articulated by the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f3w* and the ICJ in *Genocide*, set out above, the Tribunal must conclude that the causal link between the NAFTA breach and the injury alleged by the Investors has not been established. While the Tribunal has no doubt that there is a realistic possibility that the Whites Point Project would have been approved as a result of a hypothetical NAFTA-compliant JRP Process, it cannot be said that this outcome would have occurred \"in all probability\" or with \"a sufficient degree of certainty\".\n\n169.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, various outcomes of a NAFTA-compliant JRP Process are reasonably conceivable. First, a different, NAFTA-compliant process could have reasonably concluded that the Whites Point Project would have serious adverse effects on right whale and lobster habitats, which are not capable of mitigation. In this regard, a JRP could have relied on the assessment of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada's report on the North Atlantic right whale in Canada,165 and the recovery plans for the North Atlantic right whale recommended to the Canadian Government.166 While the Tribunal does not consider that such a conclusion was necessarily the most likely one, given the approval, albeit with conditions, of other Canadian quarry projects,167 it would certainly be a possible conclusion on the basis of the record before this Tribunal.\n\nCommittee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, Assessment and Update Status Report on the North Atlantic Right Whale Eubalaena Glacialis in Canada, 2003 (**Ex. R-591**).\n\nThe Right Whale Recovery Team, Canadian North Atlantic Right Wale Recovery Plan, September 2000 (**Ex. R-595**).\n\nAs noted by Mr. Estrin, the Aguathuna Quarry and Marine Terminal (1999) and Belleoram Quarry and Marine Terminal (2006-2007) were approved with conditions, *see* Estrin Report, paras. 20-22.\n\n170.\n\nSecondly, a different, NAFTA-compliant process could have reasonably concluded that, on balance, serious socio-economic adverse effects, which are not capable of mitigation, persist. While the Tribunal took issue with the manner in which the JRP relied on community core values, it did not call into question the relevance of socio-economic effects in the EA process. The record shows that the Whites Point Project was assessed to have both positive and negative socioeconomic effects. As discussed by the Tribunal in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the prospect that the Whites Point Project would create employment opportunities, notably for younger people who might otherwise have to leave the region as a result of the decline of fishery, was put to the JRP by members of the local community as an expected positive effect.168 Other members of the community suggested negative effects on tourism and the community's well-being.169 This Tribunal cannot speculate as to whether the expected negative socio-economic effects, once properly assessed by a JRP, could have outweighed the expected positive effects and justified the rejection of the Whites Point Project.\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 196; Petition, dated 26 June 2007, (**Ex. C-182**); Witness Statement of William Richard Clayton, para. 13.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 184; First Affidavit of Stephen Chapman, para. 50.\n\n171.\n\nThirdly, a different, NAFTA-compliant JRP Process could have reasonably recommended that the Whites Point Project be approved with conditions that would render it economically unviable.170 Such conditions might notably have included provisions for the protection of human health or animal health (*e.g.*, to reduce noise pollution). It would be pure speculation were this Tribunal to attempt to predict what conditions regulators might deem appropriate now or over the 50-year duration of the Whites Point Project, and what their economic effect on it might be. It suffices to note that it does not seem impossible that such conditions could render the Whites Point Project economically unviable.\n\nArticle 40(1)(b) of the NSEA; Article 53 of the CEAA.\n\n172.\n\nFourthly, even in the event of a positive recommendation by a JRP in a NAFTA-compliant JRP Process, it is not impossible, though perhaps less likely, that the federal Minister or the Nova Scotia Minister would subsequently have denied approval or approved the Whites Point Project with conditions that would render it economically unviable. The factors that were brought to the federal Cabinet's attention in 2007, in a federal Cabinet Briefing Document, included environmental effects, impacts on the tourism and fishing industries, the aesthetics of the landscape, and the way of life of the local population.171 It cannot be excluded that some of these grounds that were ostensibly considered by the Governor-in-Council in its decision to deny project approval in 2007 would also have been given weight in the event that the JRP Process had been conducted in a NAFTA-compliant fashion. Similarly, the denial of approval of an expansion of the Bayside quarry172 supports a finding that environmental approval of quarry projects, at least in the Inner Bay of Fundy, was uncertain. The Tribunal is not prepared to assume, on the basis of the evidence before it, that ministerial approval was beyond question once the JRP Process had led to a positive recommendation.\n\nBackground/Analysis Note annexed to the Whites Point Memorandum to Cabinet, 27 November 2007 (**Ex. R-620**).\n\nTestimony of Mr. Tom Dooley, Hearing Transcript, 23 February 2018, p. 1526, line 8 - p. 1527, line 4; Testimony of Dan Fougere, Hearing Transcript, 23 February 2018, p. 1574, lines 16-23.\n\n173.\n\nAs an alternative argument, the Investors' EA expert, Mr. Estrin, sought to point out that all other comparable projects in Nova Scotia were approved.173 However, while Mr. Estrin's general point that Nova Scotia has overall been a welcoming environment for quarry projects stands, the Tribunal does not believe that it should draw any specific conclusions for the approvability of the Whites Point Project from this practice.\n\nTestimony of David Estrin, Hearing Transcript, 20 February 2018, p. 519, lines 11-21.\n\n174.\n\nNor is the Tribunal convinced that the recent approval of a (substantially larger) quarry at Black Point, Nova Scotia,174 is a reliable indicator of the approvability of the Whites Point Project. Black Point is located on the Atlantic Ocean side of Nova Scotia, while Whites Point is on the Bay of Fundy. The ecology in both areas is evidently different, as is exemplified, to cite only one element, by the substantial difference in the number of whale sightings in each area. While the Digby Neck area of the Bay of Fundy shows a particularly high concentration of whale sightings, very few such sightings occur on the Atlantic side.175\n\nInvestors' Memorial, paras. 52-54.\n\nWhalesitings Database, Population Ecology Division, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Dartmouth, NS, 11 October 2017 (**Ex. R-769**).\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal must accordingly conclude that no further injury has been proven beyond the injury that is substantially uncontroversial between the Parties on the basis of the majority's finding in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, namely that the Investors were deprived of an opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. In particular, the Investors have not proven that \"in all probability\" or \"with a sufficient degree of certainty\" the Whites Point Project would have obtained all necessary approvals and would be operating profitably.\n\n176.\n\nThe Investors are thus only entitled to compensation equivalent to the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner.\n\n**V. MITIGATION OF LOSS**\n-------------------------\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Investors should have mitigated their loss by seeking domestic judicial review, \"which would have expeditiously restored the Claimants' lost opportunity.\"176 Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the Investors should only be compensated for the costs of judicial proceedings in Canadian courts and the costs of a new environmental assessment process.177\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 96.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 96; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 113.\n\n178.\n\nThe Investors deny that they were under a duty to mitigate their damages in the circumstances of the present case, as judicial review could not guarantee that their losses would be effectively remedied.\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that, should the Tribunal consider that a causal link between the Investors' damages claimed and the Respondent's violations of NAFTA is established, \"[the Tribunal] must start by determining the value of what the Claimants actually lost when they were denied the opportunity to have the project considered in accordance with Canadian law.\"178 In assessing the compensation that is due to the Investors, however, the Respondent submits that the Investors' duty to mitigate their loss must be taken into account. Since \"mitigation was reasonably available to the Claimants and Bilcon of Nova Scotia in the form of judicial review in the Canadian courts,\"179 the Respondent argues that the Investors should only be compensated for the costs of judicial proceedings in the Canadian courts and the costs of a new environmental assessment process.180\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 87.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 87. *See also,* Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 281, line 23 -p. 282, line 2.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 96; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 113.\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that a duty to mitigate is a general principle of international law applicable in the present proceedings. The principle is recognized in the ILC Articles Commentary to Article 31, which states that \"[e]ven the wholly innocent victim of wrongful conduct is expected to act reasonably when confronted by the injury\" and that \"failure to mitigate by the injured party may preclude recovery to that extent.181 In the *Case Concerning the Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project,* the ICJ noted Slovakia's argument that the mitigation of damages was a general principle of international law, but stated that:\n\nIt would follow from such a principle that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided. While this principle might thus provide a basis for the calculation of damages, it could not, on the other hand, justify an otherwise wrongful act.182\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 88, quoting from ILC Articles Commentary, Article 31, para. 11 (**Ex. RA-60**); Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 282, line 23 - p. 283, line 6.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 88, quoting from *Case Concerning the Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/Slovakia) (ICJ Reports 1997) Judgment, 25 September 1997 (\"*Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros*\"), para. 80 (**Ex. RA-116**).\n\n181.\n\nLikewise, according to the Respondent, investor-State arbitral tribunals have frequently applied this rule,183 the objective of which is \"to avoid the aggrieved party passively sitting back and waiting to be compensated for harm which it could have avoided or reduced.\"184\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 88; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 95, referring to *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co.

RA-141**).\n\n182.\n\nAs regards the relationship between the duty to mitigate loss and the conventional requirement to exhaust local remedies, the Respondent advises that, while there is no requirement to exhaust local remedies under NAFTA, the Investors are not exempt from the duty to mitigate.185 The two rules are separate and distinct: \"While the exhaustion rule relates to jurisdiction, the duty to mitigate is a damages issue.\"186 According to the Respondent, the fact that the Investors had recourse to Chapter Eleven of NAFTA does not override their duty to mitigate damages.187 In support of this position, the Respondent cites the award in *Dunkeld International Investment Limited v. The Government of Belize*, which provides:\n\n[R]ecourse to local remedies is not strictly linked to the mitigation of losses, such that any duty to mitigate should require the exhaustion of local remedies or require a party to prefer a local remedy to one that may be available to it through international arbitration. Nevertheless, it may be the case that local administrative procedures may offer a remedy that appears more rapid or certain than that of an international claim, such that a party would be derelict in failing to attempt the local process.188\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 290, lines 4-22.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 98-99, referring to *Interhandel Case (Switzerland v.

Government of Belize* (UNCITRAL) Award, 28 June 2016, para. 197 (\"*Dunkeld*\") (**Ex. RA-115**).\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that \"judicial review was also an effective remedy that would have fully restored the claimants' lost opportunity to have [their] project considered, assessed, and decided in accordance with applicable laws.\"189 Specifically, since the JRP Report was not in compliance with the legal standards set forth in the CEAA and the NSEA, the courts would \"have remitted the matter back for redetermination in accordance with the Court's reasons,\" and/or ordered that the JRP be constituted with new members. These measures \"would have *fully* restored [the Investors'] opportunity to have\" their Whites Point Project assessed in accordance with Canadian laws.190 (Emphasis in original)\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2589, lines 9-13.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 92-95, referring to Expert Report of the Hon. John M. Evans, 9 June 2017, paras. 64-66, 74-78 (\"Evans Report\") (**Ex. RE-6**), Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, pp. 283 *et seq*.\n\n184.\n\nRegarding the Investors' argument that judicial review would not provide them with effective remedies equivalent to the ones available under NAFTA Chapter Eleven, particularly regarding damages, the Respondent points out that, while Article 1135 only allows tribunals to award monetary damages, restitution of property, and any applicable interest, judicial review would have allowed for a redetermination by a new JRP, effectively remedying the NAFTA breach, and allowing the Whites Point Project to proceed. The Respondent adds that there is no basis for the Investors to believe that a new JRP would have been unfair, unreasonable or unlawful.191\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2590-2591.\n\n185.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that Article 1121 of NAFTA does not prevent the Investors from seeking judicial review before Canadian courts. This is because, whereas Article 1121(1) and 1121(2) order that an investor and its enterprise first waive its right to pursue their claims in domestic courts of a host State before embarking on NAFTA arbitral proceedings, the provision does not prevent them from launching \"proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages\" in parallel.192\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2589, lines 18-24.\n\n186.\n\nIn response to the Investors' argument that Canadian courts, if faced with a damages claim, would not require a claimant to mitigate loss through judicial review, the Respondent argues that Canadian domestic law is not applicable here since NAFTA Article 1131 expressly provides that the dispute shall be decided in accordance with NAFTA and the applicable rules of international law.193 In any case, even if Canadian law were relevant, the Respondent submits that a recent Supreme Court of Canada case, *Ernst v. Alberta Energy Regulator,* supports its assertion that judicial review is an appropriate mitigation tool.194 It also rejects the Investors' reliance upon another Supreme Court of Canada case, *Attorney General v. TeleZone*, by noting that the case did not involve a ruling on liability or damages.195\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 94, Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2587, line 23 - p. 2588, line 4.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 97, referring to *Ernst v.

THE INVESTORS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Investors submit that domestic judicial review is not an adequate remedy in the present circumstances. This is, they argue, because the Investors have been subjected to misconduct by officials of the Canadian Government for several years, and requiring them to go through additional years of judicial proceedings and another JRP Process could not guarantee that their losses would be effectively remedied.196 In particular, the Investors note that what they had encountered was not \"a mere misapplication of Canadian law that could have been rectified through judicial review.\" Rather, \"[t]he political, administrative and bureaucratic environment within which the Whites Point [q]uarry was considered was biased against the Investors from the start and throughout.\"197\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 234, 242.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 240.\n\n188.\n\nFor this reason, the Investors argue that a possibility that a second JRP Process might be commenced as a result of judicial review would lead to \"a hopeless cycle between a biased administrative process and a court system ill-equipped to correct it,\" as the process is likely to be conducted in \"the same poisoned environment.\"198 Relying on the Respondent's expert, the Hon. John Evans, the Investors argue that even in their likely best outcome, they would have had to go through lengthy judicial review proceedings, as a result of which their case would have been referred back to another JRP, without any assurances that the Whites Point Project would eventually be approved.199 In any event, the Investors assert that, notwithstanding various obstacles, they had always been actively engaged in alleviating the losses suffered from the Respondent's conduct by trying their best to navigate through the JRP Process in good faith.200\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 12-15, 246.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2435, lines 3-10.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 249.\n\n189.\n\nConsequently, the Investors should not be required to pursue local remedies in this case. As the tribunal in *Dunkeld* observed, the duty to mitigate through domestic means would be required only when such means could provide a more rapid and certain remedy than an international claim.201\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 244, citing *Dunkeld*, para. 197 (**Ex. RA-115**).\n\n190.\n\nThe Investors also argue that the passage in the ICJ's judgment in *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* quoted by the Respondent did not reflect the ICJ's own understanding of the duty to mitigate, but merely paraphrased an argument made by the Slovak Republic. Ultimately, the Investors suggest that the ICJ did not examine the question of mitigating losses at all.202\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 277, referring to *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros*, paras. 80-81 (**Ex. RA-15**).\n\n191.\n\nFurthermore, the Investors observe that if this were a dispute in a Canadian court, there would not have been an obligation to mitigate loss by first seeking judicial review before seeking damages.203 To support their case, they cite the Supreme Court of Canada decision in *Attorney General v. TeleZone*, which states:\n\nIf the claimant is content to let the order stand and instead seeks compensation for alleged losses (as here), there is no principled reason why it should be forced to detour to the Federal Court for the extra step of a judicial review application (itself sometimes a costly undertaking) when that is not the relief it seeks. Access to justice requires that the claimant be permitted to pursue its chosen remedy directly and, to the greatest extent possible, without procedural detours.204\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 250, referring to Expert Report of Professor John McCamus, 14 August 2017, para. 26.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 251-258, quoting from *TeleZone*, para. 19 (**Ex. CA-445**).\n\n192.\n\nIn any case, there is no guarantee that, had the Investors pursued judicial review, the Canadian courts would have ordered a sufficient remedy given the broad scope of discretion available to them on judicial review cases.205\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 257, referring to *TeleZone*, para. 56 (**Ex. CA-445**).\n\n193.\n\nIn addition, the Investors argue that imposing upon them a duty to mitigate their losses through judicial review is effectively tantamount to requiring them to exhaust local remedies, an obligation which does not exist under NAFTA.206 As such, \"[i]f Canada cannot bar a NAFTA claim [directly] because a prospective claimant has not exhausted local remedies, it should not be able to eviscerate the NAFTA claim by [indirectly] raising the [argument] at the damages phase.\"207 Under NAFTA, the Investors assert, they had a right to choose their remedy, and they chose the option to go through the NAFTA process.208\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 259-261, 269-270.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 262.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2435, lines 18-20.\n\n194.\n\nAlternatively, should the Tribunal decide that the duty to mitigate applies in this case, the Investors argue that such duty is nonetheless governed by the standard of reasonableness209 (*i.e.* \"the Investors only need to take reasonable steps to mitigate\"), and it should not be applied in a manner that unduly favours the wrongdoer.210 In this regard, the question as to what mitigation measure is reasonable is a factual matter, and the burden of proof is on the Respondent, having raised the mitigation defence.211\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 271.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 275, referring to Irmgard Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law (Oxford University Press 2017), paras. 3,256-3.257 (**Ex.

Existence of Duty of Mitigation in International Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there are no reasons why the duty to mitigate, as an important aspect of the law on State responsibility, and as elaborated by various international courts and tribunals, should not also apply in a NAFTA context.\n\n196.\n\nUnder international law, a failure by an injured State to take reasonable steps to limit the losses it incurred as a result of an internationally wrongful act by another State may result in a reduction of recovery to the extent of the damage that could have been avoided. This principle has been affirmed by the ILC212 and applied by international tribunals.213\n\nILC Articles Commentary, Article 31, para. 11 (\"Even the wholly innocent victim of wrongful conduct is expected to act reasonably when confronted by the injury. Although often expressed in terms of a 'duty to mitigate,' this is not a legal obligation which itself gives rise to responsibility. It is rather that a failure to mitigate by the injured party may preclude recovery to that extent.\") (**Ex. RA-60**).\n\n*See Gabcikovo-Nagymaros,* para. 80 (\"[A]n injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.\") (**Ex. RA-15**); U.N. Compensation Commission, Governing Council decision 15, *Compensation for Business Losses Resulting from Iraq's Unlawful Invasion and Occupation of Kuwait where the Trade Embargo and Related Measures Were also a Cause*, 8th sess., 14-18 Dec. 1992, U.N. Doc. S/AC.26/1992/15 (1992), para. 9 (IV) (\"The total amount of compensable losses will be reduced to the extent that those losses could reasonably have been avoided.\"); U.N. Compensation Commission, Governing Council, *Report and Recommendations Made by the Panel of Commissioners Appointed to Review the Well Blowout Control Claim*, 15 Nov. 1996, U.N. Doc. S/AC.26/1996/5/Annex (18 Dec. 1996), para. 54 (\"[U]nder the general principles of international law relating to mitigation of damages [...] the Claimant was not only permitted but indeed obligated to take reasonable steps to [...] mitigate the loss, damage or injury being caused\") (\"*Well Blowout Control Claim*\"). Investment tribunals have also recognized the principle of mitigation of damages. *See, e.g.*, *Middle East Cement*, para. 167 (**Ex. CA-322**); *Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6), Award, 7 July 2011, paras. 246, 250-251.\n\n197.\n\nThe ILC Articles Commentary bases the duty to mitigate in public international law on the ICJ's judgment in *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* and the UNCC decision on the *Well Blowout Control Claim*.214 On one view, and as the Investors in this case maintain,215 the ICJ in the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* judgment at paragraph 80 merely summarized Slovakia's argument that when Slovakia carried out Variant C, it was mitigating damages and that this duty amounted to a general principle of law.216 In paragraph 81, the ICJ went on to hold that there was no need for it to further examine such duty, given that Slovakia's operationalization of Variant C amounted to an internationally wrongful act. Thus, arguably, the ICJ made no conclusive finding on the duty to mitigate.217\n\nILC Articles Commentary, Article 31, para. 11, fns. 467-468 (**Ex. RA-60**).\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 277, referring to *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros*, paras. 80-81 (**Ex. RA-15**).\n\n*Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros*, para. 80 (**Ex. RA-15**).\n\nSergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (BIICL 2008), p. 320 (**Ex. RA-133 / CA-381**).\n\n198.\n\nOn another view, however, the ICJ in *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* implicitly endorsed a duty to mitigate when it stated that *\"while [the mitigation] principle might thus provide a basis for the calculation of damages,* it could not, on the other hand, justify an otherwise wrongful act.\"218 (Emphasis added) This reading appears to be shared by ILC Special Rapporteur Crawford219 and Judge Higgins220 in their commentaries on the ILC Articles.\n\n*Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros*, para. 80 (**Ex. RA-15**).\n\nJames Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 495 (\"the Court can be seen to have accepted that the failure of an injured party to mitigate damage may preclude recovery to that extent\").\n\nRossalyn Higgins, 'Overview of Part Two of the Articles on State Responsibility', in Crawford, J., Pellet, A. and Olleson, S. (eds.), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford University Press) 537, p. 540 (\"[I]t would seem that here the Court was making a slightly different point from that which is cited. While implicitly approving the principle of mitigation as articulated by Slovakia, which it had cited immediately before (and which is also reproduced in the Commentary), the Court was stating that measures taken to mitigate could not be those which themselves were wrongful in terms of the legal relationship between the parties. Put differently, wrongfulness in State responsibility is not precluded by the act in question being in mitigation of damages potentially due from the other party for a prior breach of an obligation.\")\n\n199.\n\nThis last mentioned view is also supported by a second case that the ILC cited in support of the existence of the duty to mitigate in the law of State responsibility, the *Well Blowout Control Claim*. The UNCC Panel considered that \"under the general principles of international law relating to mitigation of damages [...] the Claimant was not only permitted but indeed obligated to take reasonable steps to [...] mitigate the loss, damage or injury being caused.\"221 Many international commissions and tribunals have endorsed this same position.222\n\n*Well Blowout Control Claim* (Report of 15 November 1996 (S/AC.26/1994/5); 92 AJIL 287, 290. The guidelines of the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission mention the duty to mitigate, see Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission, Decision of 6 March 1992, S/AC.26/1992/9, 'Propositions and Conclusions on Compensation for Business Losses: Types of Damages and Their Valuation', \u00a76 and Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission, Decision of 4 January 1993, S/AC.26/1992/15, 'Compensation for Business Losses Resulting from Iraq's Unlawful Invasion and Occupation of Kuwait where the Trade Embargo and Related Measures Were also a Cause', \u00a7 9(IV)(i).\n\n*Execution of German-Portuguese Arbitral* (Germany, Portugal), Award, 30 June 1930, reprinted *in* III RIAA 1371-1386; *Eritrea's Damages Claims*, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission, Final Award, 17 August 2009, reprinted *in* 26 RIAA 505, 554; *Alan Craig v.

In *Middle East Cement v. Egypt*, the tribunal considered that the \"duty to mitigate damages is not expressly mentioned in the BIT. However, this duty can be considered to be part of the General Principles of Law which, in turn, are part of the rules of international law which are applicable in this dispute.\"223 The *Hrvatska v. Slovenia* tribunal also affirmed a duty to mitigate, stating that \"general principles of international law applicable in this case require an innocent party to act reasonably in attempting to mitigate its losses.\"224 Likewise, the *AIG v. Kazakhstan* tribunal affirmed that \"[m]itigation of damages, as a principle, is applicable in a wide range of situations. It has been adopted in common law and in civil law countries, as well as in International Conventions and other international instruments.\"225 The *EDF v. Argentina* tribunal considered that \"the duty to mitigate damages is a well-established principle in investment arbitration.\"226 In *Dunkeld*, the tribunal premised the requirement to resort to a domestic compensation process in certain circumstances on the existence of duty to mitigate.227\n\n*Middle East Cement*, para. 167 (**Ex. CA-322**).\n\n*Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d. v. Republic of Slovenia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/24), Award (17 December 2015), para. 215.\n\n*AIG Capital Partners, Inc. & CJSC Tema Real Estate Co. v.

RA-115**).\n\n201.\n\nAs well as being recognized as a principle, several investment tribunals have applied the duty to mitigate. For instance, the *BRIDAS v. Turkmenistan* tribunal reduced compensation of US$ 495 million by US$ 50 million due to the claimant's failure to mitigate.228 In *Achmea v. Slovak Republic*, the tribunal held that the suspension of operations was \"a reasonable defensive measure, intended to minimize the risk of further losses,\" and accordingly rejected the respondent's argument that the claimant failed to mitigate loss.229\n\n*BRIDAS S.A.P.I.C. et al. v. Government of Turkmenistan et al.*, (ICC Case No. 9058/FMS/KGA), Third Partial Award and Dissent, 2 September 2000, p. 13.\n\n*Achmea BV v. The Slovak Republic* (UNCITRAL, PCA Case No 2008-13 (formerly *Eureko BV v. The Slovak Republic*)), Final Award, 7 December 2012, para. 320.\n\n202.\n\nNAFTA contains no express *lex specialis* with respect to the duty to mitigate. As a result, the general rules of State responsibility apply.\n\n203.\n\nHaving established that, in principle, a duty of mitigation of damages can arise in public international law, including in the context of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, the Tribunal shall now turn to the content of such a duty.\n\n204.\n\nBy its nature, the duty to mitigate is a restriction on compensatory damages. The rationale of the duty to mitigate damages is to encourage efficiency and to minimize the consequences of unlawful conduct (such as a breach of treaty). The duty to mitigate applies if: (i) a claimant is unreasonably inactive following a breach of treaty; or (ii) a claimant engages in unreasonable conduct following a breach of treaty.\n\n205.\n\nThe first limb of the mitigation principle concerns the unreasonable failure by the claimant to act subsequent to a breach of treaty, where it could have reduced the damages arising (including by incurring certain additional expenses). The second limb, conversely, concerns the unreasonable incurring of expenses by the claimant subsequent to a treaty breach, which results in increasing the size of its claim.\n\n**2. Content of Duty of Mitigation in the Present Case**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nIn the present case, there is no suggestion that the Investors have incurred unreasonable expenses after the NAFTA breach, for which they now seek compensation from the Respondent (the second limb of the mitigation principle). In fact, any expenses incurred in the weeks after the adoption of the JRP Report in 2007 appear to be minimal, and ostensibly directed at influencing or reversing the subsequent decisions of the federal and Nova Scotia Governments. Rather, the Respondent's mitigation argument is focused on the first limb of the mitigation principle. The Respondent contends that the Investors were unreasonably inactive following the NAFTA breach, by failing to have recourse to judicial review of the decisions of the federal and Nova Scotia Government where that could be expected of them.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that what the Respondent considers judicial review could achieve is not so much the mitigation of the damages incurred by the Investors, but a reversal of the Investors' injury. The Tribunal has doubts, however, that the Investors' duty to mitigate extends so far as to undo the injury (rather than limiting the consequent financial damages).\n\n208.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal observes that it has not found, in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability or the present Award, that the Investors would have had an automatic right to another JRP process if only they had resorted to judicial review. Rather, as the Respondent and its principal expert on this point, Justice Evans, appear to acknowledge, judicial review would only have offered the Investors the opportunity to try to obtain the right to another JRP process.230 While Justice Evans regards the granting of such remedy to be likely, \"in view of the errors of domestic law identified by the Tribunal\",231 it remains the case that \"[t]he grant of relief is in the discretion of the reviewing court\".232\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2590, lines 7-12 (\"In judicial review, the Courts determine the legality, rationality, and procedural fairness of administrative action and will normally provide a remedy when the action under review does not meet these standards.\"); Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2592, lines 14-17 (\"If there are concerns regarding the unfairness or bias against the claimants, the Court could have remitted the EA back to a new panel.\").\n\nEvans Report, para. 77 (**Ex. RE-6**); Evans Rejoinder Report, para. 2 (**Ex. RE-14**).\n\nEvans Report, para. 31 (**Ex. RE-6**).\n\n209.\n\nIn any event, in the Tribunal's view, judicial review could not have reversed entirely the injury incurred by the Investors in this case (*i.e.* the loss of the opportunity to be subject to a process that was consistent with NAFTA requirements). In its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal concluded that the conduct of organs of the Canadian Government was inconsistent with NAFTA Chapter Eleven (rather than with Canadian law); whether or not a Canadian court in domestic judicial review proceedings would and could have remedied that specific violation of international law is an open question, on which the Parties have not briefed the Tribunal. Conceptually, however, the loss of an opportunity to have one's project assessed consistently with Canadian law is distinct from the loss of an opportunity to have one's project assessed consistently with an international treaty. It is the loss of the latter opportunity that constitutes the Investors' injury in the present case.\n\n210.\n\nFurthermore, in the Tribunal's view it cannot be said that judicial review followed by a new EA would have restored to the Investors the same opportunity that they have lost. Judicial review would have offered a different remedy, with its own advantages and disadvantages, but it could not have fully mitigated the specific injury caused in this case. The qualitative difference of administrative or judicial review and damages claims is recognized NAFTA Article 1121, as the Respondent has rightly pointed out in another context.233\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2589, lines 14-24.\n\n211.\n\nIt is correct that the duty of mitigation under public international law may in principle include recourse to administrative remedies and/or judicial review. In *Dunkeld*, an arbitration arising out of a shareholder challenge of Belize's compulsory acquisition of shares, the tribunal found that Dunkeld was obliged in the specific circumstances to mitigate its loss, and did so on the facts by availing itself of the domestic compensation process in Belize.234 The paragraph of the *Dunkeld* award which the Respondent cited in its Counter-Memorial underscores that the duty to mitigate may require that the claimant attempt local remedies,235 especially in circumstances where domestic administrative procedures offer a \"more rapid or certain\" remedy.236 However, the *Dunkeld* tribunal emphasized that this duty was limited to *reasonable* steps in the specific circumstances of each case,237 and that such duty could not lead to the claimant having to forego international remedies.\n\n*Dunkeld*, para. 196 (**Ex. RA-115**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 90, quoting from *Dunkeld*, para. 197 (**Ex. RA-115**).\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 244, citing *Dunkeld*, para. 197 (**Ex. RA-115**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 90, quoting from *Dunkeld*, para. 199 (**Ex. RA-115**). The tribunal applies the reasonableness criterion in section 2 below.\n\n212.\n\nThe present case differs in an important respect from *Dunkeld*. *Dunkeld* was concerned with the narrow question of compensation for the direct expropriation of shares for which the Government of Belize established a dedicated domestic valuation process. It was common ground that the Government of Belize had acquired the shares. In the present case, by contrast, the questions that Canadian courts would have considered on judicial review, and that this Tribunal has considered, are the main complex of questions concerning the Respondent's compliance with applicable Canadian laws and, insofar as this Tribunal is concerned, with NAFTA Chapter Eleven in conducting an EA.\n\n213.\n\nFinally, it would seem to this Tribunal that, in assessing what remedies a claimant may be expected to have recourse to in a given case in fulfilment of a duty of mitigation, a court or tribunal should take account of the procedural rights granted to that claimant under the underlying treaty. In particular, the mitigation requirement must not lead to the imposition of a requirement of exhausting local remedies where there is none provided for in the treaty. Many forms of injury for which NAFTA Chapter Eleven provides a forum for damages claims might in theory be mitigated by pursuing local remedies, possibly involving several layers of court review. The NAFTA drafters did not intend to require claimants to systematically pursue local remedies before recovering their losses in international proceedings. The Tribunal must give effect to that judgment of the parties to NAFTA (\"NAFTA Parties\") and avoid introducing a local remedies requirement through the backdoor of mitigation.238\n\n*Dunkeld*, para. 197 (**Ex. RA-115**) (There is no strict link between the duty to mitigate and the requirement to exhaust local remedies); *see also* Thomas Walde and Borzu Sabahi, 'Compensation, Damages and Valuation' in Peter T. Muchlinski, Federico Ortino, Christoph Schreuer (eds.), *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (OUP 2008) 1097 (\"...reasonable, practically and easily available domestic remedies do have to be used to mitigate damages, but that should be within a relatively wide 'margin of appreciation' for the claimant. The mitigation principle should also not be used to bring in through the back door the principle of exhaustion of domestic remedies when the treaties have clearly excluded it\").\n\n214.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that in the present case the duty of mitigation of damages did not entail a duty to challenge the JRP Report through local judicial review.\n\n**3. Reasonableness of Non-Pursuit of Judicial Review after the Treaty Breach**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nIn any event, even if one considered that the duty of mitigation of damages in the present case did extend to judicial review, the Tribunal finds that it was not unreasonable for the Investors to refrain from seeking to re-establish the lost opportunity of having their project assessed consistently with NAFTA through judicial review proceedings.\n\n216.\n\nAfter the JRP Process had proceeded the way it did, it was not unreasonable for the Investors to assume that it would be difficult to rebuild the relationship with the local population around Whites Point. Following the JRP Process, a significant proportion of the local population was opposed to the Investors and their project.239 The Tribunal recalls that, in the first phase of these proceedings, it was presented with evidence of vandalism against the Investors' property and threats against them and their supporters while the EA process was ongoing.240 The point here is not, as the Investors have argued, that there was an environment of systematic bias against the Investors within the Canada's federal or provincial Governments (a proposition that the Tribunal does not regard as established);241 rather, the Tribunal accepts that there was a reasonable basis for the Investors to judge that, even if they succeeded in judicial review, such legal remedy would not necessarily undo the loss of their opportunity. Successful judicial review may not have returned to them the opportunity they lost, given the persisting effects of the NAFTA breach on the ground.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Liability, paras 507-14.\n\nMemorial of the Investors, para. 201, citing Joint Review Panel Public Hearing Transcript, Vol. 9, 26 June 2007, at 5:2125, 6:2125, 8:2125, 10:2125, 11:2125, and 16:2125 (**Ex. C-162**).\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 240.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that it was not unreasonable for the Investors to conclude, as they did, that a do-over of the environmental assessment would have been costly. As Mr. Buxton has testified, the data submitted during the original EA was unlikely to be current enough to be resubmitted to a new JRP.242 The Tribunal tends to regard Mr. Buxton's view as more plausible than the Respondent's suggestion, based on Justice Evans' report, that the same expert reports could have been resubmitted in essentially the same form.243 In any event, the Tribunal has no doubt that the Investors were reasonably advised by their technical consultant, Mr. Buxton, that the costs of a new EA would be significant.\n\nBuxton Reply Statement, para. 46.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 98, citing Evans Report, para. 79 (**Ex. RE-6**).\n\n218.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it was not unreasonable for the Investors in the specific circumstances of the case to refrain from engaging in judicial review.\n\n219.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal expressly leaves open the question whether mitigation measures might have been reasonably expected of the Investors to minimize the size of a claim for lost profits. One might have expected the Investors actively to have identified other quarry projects, in Canada or elsewhere, that could have met the Investors' needs for the five decades to come. One might equally contemplate whether, in a \"but for\" scenario where the profitable operation of a quarry at Whites Point for five decades was virtually certain, the Investors would have been expected to seek approval of a redesigned quarry project through a new EA application. Given its conclusion above that the Investors have not established causation in respect of lost profits, however, the Tribunal is not required to make any findings with regard to such a \"but for\" scenario.\n\n**VI. CALCULATION OF DAMAGES**\n------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nHaving determined the heads of damages to which the Investors are entitled, the Tribunal shall now turn to the quantification of such damages. It is evident that the amount of damages to be awarded is closely related to questions of causation and mitigation. The Parties have presented arguments on quantum in respect of different, mutually exclusive causation and mitigation scenarios:\n\n- Were the Tribunal to find that the Respondent's NAFTA breaches could have been mitigated easily, the Respondent argues that the Investors should be entitled only to the costs they would have incurred to mitigate their losses (\"Mitigation Costs\").\n\n- Were the Tribunal to find that the Respondent's NAFTA breaches cannot be proven to have affected the ultimate result of the permit application, the Respondent argues that the Investors should be entitled only to the reimbursement of the costs of the faulty JRP Process, having lost a fair opportunity to have their application considered but no more (\"JRP Process Costs\").\n\n- Were the Tribunal to conclude that, but for the breach, the permit would have been granted and the Whites Point Project would have proceeded, the types of damages to be awarded by the Tribunal would be different. Under this scenario, the Investors argue that they should be awarded lost profits on the basis of a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method (\"Projected Lost Profit\").244 The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that, since the investment was never in operation and its future profitability is uncertain, the Investors are only entitled to damages equivalent to their actual investment costs (\"Investment Costs\").245\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 174-204.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 107-115.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that the Investors are entitled to compensation equivalent to the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. In its analysis below, the Tribunal will thus address only the quantification of that opportunity. Before doing so, however, the Tribunal will briefly restate the Parties' positions in respect of the various causation and mitigation scenarios discussed by them.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' VALUATION UNDER VARIOUS CAUSATION AND MITIGATION SCENARIOS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent's primary case is that the Tribunal should award no damages to the Investors.246 In the alternative, the Respondent suggests that the Investors might be entitled to Mitigation Costs; in the further alternative, the Respondent considers that the Investors might be entitled to JRP Process Costs; and in the further alternative, the Respondent argues that the Investors should at most be entitled to sunk Investment Costs. The Respondent's three alternative approaches to valuation are summarized below. The Tribunal will finally summarize the Investors' case for Projected Lost Profit.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 84; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 155, line 23 - p. 156, line 17, p. 212, line 7-10.\n\n**1. Mitigation Costs**\n-----------------------\n\n223.\n\nUnder the first scenario, the assumption is that it would have been possible for the Investors to mitigate all their losses suffered as a result of the NAFTA breaches by the Respondent by means of domestic judicial review, which would have been followed by a fresh and untainted JRP Process.\n\n**a. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent submits that, pursuant to the Investors' obligation to mitigate their losses, the damage incurred by the Respondent's NAFTA breaches would have been easily and effectively cured, had the Investors pursued their remedies before Canadian domestic courts. Accordingly, the Investors would be entitled to total costs of C$ 1,150,644.247 The amount proposed by the Respondent is based on the Expert Report of Mr. Darrell B. Chodorow of the Brattle Group (\"Brattle Group Report\") which. The mitigation costs include: (i) legal costs in the judicial review process: C$ 77,982;248 and (ii) costs of remitting the assessment back to a newly constituted JRP: C$ 1,072,662.249\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 97-98, referring to Evans Report (**Ex. RE-6**); Expert Report of The Brattle Group (Mr. Darrell B. Chodorow), 9 June 2017 (\"Brattle Group Report\") (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 97, citing Brattle Group Report, Table E.16 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 98, citing Brattle Group Report, Table C.3 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\n**b. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Investors do not expressly dispute the Respondent's calculation, since they exclusively argue that they are entitled to recover lost profits and focus their valuation of damages on that presumption.\n\n**2. JRP Process Costs**\n------------------------\n\n226.\n\nUnder the second scenario, the assumption is that a different JRP Process conducted on a basis that was consistent with NAFTA might still have led to the rejection of the Whites Point Project, either as a result of the recommendation of the JRP or as a result of the Government's exercise of its discretion in deciding on the approval of the Whites Point Project.\n\n**a. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nIn this scenario, the Respondent submits that the Investors can only recover the costs incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia in the JRP Process which, first, can be substantiated, and, secondly, occurred when the JRP Process was ongoing, *i.e.* between 3 November 2004 (the date when the JRP was established) and 22 October 2007 (the date when the JRP issued its Report),250 as this is the period during which the Tribunal found that the Respondent's violations of NAFTA took place: \"The JRP could not have taken any actions either before it was constituted or after it submitted its Report.\"251\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 119.\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the amount of damages has to be proven by the Investors and can by no means exceed C$ [REDACTED] In arriving at this number, the Respondent refers to the Brattle Group Report, pursuant to which the following estimates are made: (i) payment to individuals and firms contributing to the EA (\"Consulting Experts\"): C$ [REDACTED] (ii) payments to government entities for the JRP itself and related costs (\"Panel Costs\"): C$ [REDACTED] and (iii) payments for office and operational expenses (\"Office & Operations\"): C$[REDACTED] Yet, according to the Respondent, as of the date of the submission of the Respondent's Rejoinder, only C$ [REDACTED] of said amount had been substantiated.254\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 124, citing Expert Rejoinder Report of The Brattle Group (Mr. Darrell B. Chodorow), 6 November 2017, para. 41, Table 3 (\"Brattle Group Rejoinder Report\") (**Ex. RE-13**).\n\n**b. The Investors' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nIn their written submissions, the Investors do not expressly dispute the Respondent's calculation, since they exclusively argue that they are entitled to recover lost profits and focus their valuation of damages on that presumption.\n\n230.\n\nHowever, some objections to the Respondent's assumptions are found in the Reply Witness Statement of Mr. Paul Buxton (\"Buxton Reply Statement\"), in which Mr. Buxton notes that \"all of the costs incurred by the Investors in relation to the environmental assessment should be included in the calculation of historic costs,\"255 and the calculation should cover the period from the end of May 2002 (the moment when Mr. Buxton started preparing a study on the Whites Point Project) to 17 December 2007 (the date when the Whites Point Project was formally rejected by the Respondent).256\n\nBuxton Reply Statement, para. 79.\n\nBuxton Reply Statement, paras. 70-78.\n\n**3. Actual Investment Costs or Projected Lost Profits**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nUnder the third scenario, the assumption is that, had there been no breach, the permit to operate the Whites Point Project would have been granted, and the Whites Point Project would have been brought to profitable operation. Assuming such a \"but for\" scenario, the Parties disagree on the type of compensation/damages to which the Investors are entitled. The Investors contend that they are entitled to compensation of their lost profits, to be calculated on the basis of a DCF approach. The Respondent submits that the Investors are entitled at most to a reimbursement of their actual investment costs. Moreover, even assuming that the Investors should be compensated for lost profits, the Parties disagree as to the methodology for quantifying such lost profits.\n\n**a. Actual Investment Costs**\n------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Investors are entitled at most to a reimbursement of the actual investment costs, because the Whites Point Project \"is not a going concern, does not have a sufficient history of dealings, or has no legal right to exploit the project site.\"257 The Investors, on the other hand, object to compensation assessed on the basis of investment costs.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 115; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, pp. 253-257.\n\ni. The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n233.\n\nShould the Tribunal conclude that the Investors' Whites Point Project would have been approved, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should award compensation only for the actual amount invested by the Investors.258\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 107, referring to ILC Articles Commentary, Article 36, commentary (27) (**Ex.

Republic of Kazakhstan*,265 and *Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v.

RA-146**); *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15), Award, 1 June 2009, paras. 510, 567-570 (**Ex. CA-335**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 142.\n\n238.\n\nAs regards the *Crystallex* and *Gold Reserve* awards (relied upon by the Investors), the Respondent acknowledges that the tribunals in question awarded lost profits as compensation to the claimants notwithstanding the incipient state of their investments. Nevertheless, the Respondent argues that the facts in those two cases are different from the present one. Namely, in *Crystallex*, the Respondent asserts that the claimant in that case satisfied its burden to prove that Bolivia had deprived the profits the claimant would have actually earned \"given the \"breath of activities\" undertaken by the claimant to bring the mine to a \"shovel-ready\" state, and the contemporaneously prepared feasibility studies establishing the size of the deposits.\"274 Similarly, in *Gold Reserve,* the claimant \"had vested mining rights\";275 it was granted required permits, undertook substantial mining work, and established contemporaneous feasibility studies.276 Yet, the tribunal did not award lost profits in relation to the \"North Parcel\" to which the claimant had no rights.277 Likewise, in *Rosoro*, the claimant held a number of concessions and contracts, some of which were in the production stage. Nonetheless, the tribunal rejected the DCF approach, elaborating that it is not a panacea.278\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 113; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 130, citing *Crystallex*, paras. 664, 875-876, 880, 945 (**Ex. CA-317**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 129.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 114, citing *Gold Reserve*, paras. 11-12, 578-579 (**Ex.

CA-345**).\n\n239.\n\nAs a consequence, given the Investors' lack of a vested right279 and the \"very early stage of project development\" of the Whites Point Project (*i.e.* the absence of operating permits and the lack of feasibility study on the deposits),280 the Respondent submits that the use of DCF is \"too remote, uncertain, and speculative.\"281 Instead, \"the only appropriate way to value the Whites Point project at the date of the breach would be to examine the amounts Bilcon of Nova Scotia had invested in the project\" from 24 April 2002 (the date when Bilcon of Nova Scotia was incorporated) to 22 October 2007 (the date of the breach),282 amounts that would have to be substantiated by evidence and should not be higher than C$ [REDACTED] In arriving at this amount, the Respondent refers to the Brattle Group Report, which lists costs under the following categories: (i) Consulting Experts: C$ [REDACTED](ii) Panel Costs: C$ [REDACTED] (iii) Office & Operations: C$ [REDACTED] and (iv) payments to buy Nova Stone Exporter Inc.'s (\"Nova Stone\") stake in Global Quarry Products (\"GQP\", the joint venture between Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Nova Stone): C$ [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 131.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 116.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 131.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 117-118.\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, for the Investors to be entitled to this amount of damages, they have to first prove that it \"is supported by invoice evidence and is therefore verifiable.\"285 As of 6 November 2017 (the date on which the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder), the Respondent argues, the proven amount of the investment costs was C$ [REDACTED] That said, since the Investors have not claimed this type of loss, the Tribunal should consider awarding no damages at all to them.287 Indeed, the Respondent argues that the Investors have not requested a sunk costs award but a lost profits award. Thus, the Tribunal cannot award damages that the Investors have not requested.288\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 123, citing Brattle Group Report, para. 53 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 144.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2503, lines 19-24.\n\nii. The Investors' Position\n---------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Investors elaborate that the principle of full reparation requires that tribunals \"[examine] the investor's actual financial situation and [compare] it with 'the one that would have prevailed had the act not been committed'. In other words, the comparison is made with the situation which would have hypothetically prevailed using a 'but for' scenario,\"289*i.e.* the \"differential method\". In this respect, the DCF valuation method is used to calculate loss of future profits,290 where on a balance of probabilities basis291 \"the future cash flow is reasonably ascertainable and not purely speculative,\"292 even if the investment has not yet been operational.293 For these reasons, the Investors contend that the Tribunal should award them compensation based on the calculation of lost profits.294 The Investors accordingly decline to specifically address the Respondent's calculation of their sunk investment costs.\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 237, quoting from Patrick Dumberry, The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: A Guide to NAFTA Case Law on Article 1105 (Kluwer Law International 2013), pp. 300-301 (**Ex.

Projected Lost Profits**\n-----------------------------\n\n242.\n\nAssuming that the Investors are entitled to compensation of their lost profits, there remain numerous points of disagreement between the Parties as regards the methodology for quantifying such lost profits, including the valuation date, the assessment of market conditions and associated risks, the projection of future revenue, the projection of costs, and the discount rate to be applied to the projected net cash flow.295 Moreover, the Parties disagree on the relevance of past transactions and buy-out proposals in connection with the investment.296 The Investors submit that they are entitled to compensation in the form of lost profits, to be quantified in accordance with a DCF approach. By contrast, the Respondent asserts that a DCF approach should not be relied upon to calculate lost profits, and that at any rate the Investors' DCF model \"is rife with flaws that result in a gross overvaluation of the project's potential profits.\"297\n\nInvestors' Reply, Part II(B); *cf.* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, Part VII.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 205-206; *cf.* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 135-136.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 148.\n\ni. Valuation Date in respect of Future Earnings\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the valuation of damages (lost profits) should be made based on information available at the date of the breach or the date of the award. While the Investors argue that, for them to be fully compensated, the valuation must be made on the date of award, taking recent developments up to such date into consideration,298 the Respondent asserts that the date of the breach (22 October 2007) is the appropriate valuation date.299\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 23-41.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 107.\n\n*(a) The Investors' Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Investors argue that, to \"reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that [wrongdoing] had not been committed,\"300 \"the appropriate date to value the Investors' investment is the date of the arbitration Award.\"301 This will \"ensure that the Investors will be properly compensated, by taking into account the events and conditions which have actually transpired in the ten years since Canada's wrongdoing.\"302 Otherwise, the Tribunal would have to \"artificially create a proxy for the market outlook as of the breach date.\"303\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w*, p. 47 (**Ex.

Republic of Hungary*, *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation*, and *Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe*.304 The different tribunals in these cases essentially ruled that, \"where the valuation date was in dispute, compensation for [a] State's illegal conduct (whether it is an expropriation or [a] breach of another treaty provision) should be based on the higher value of the investment at the date of the award\" so that the principle of full reparation is respected.305\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 34-39, citing *ADC Affiliate Limited v.

The Russian Federation* (UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA227), 18 July 2014, para. 1763 (\"*Yukos*\") (**Ex. CA-331**); and *Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), Award, 28 July 2015 (\"*von Pezold*\") (**Ex. CA-332**).\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 36.\n\n*(b) The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nWhile the Respondent agrees with the Investors that the principle of full reparation is applicable, it disagrees with the Investors' application of that principle. The Respondent contends that the subject of valuation in this case is the Investors' loss of opportunity to have their Whites Point Project fairly assessed by the Government, and \"if the loss of that opportunity is best valued by calculating the lost profits of the Project, then those profits must be calculated as of the date the opportunity was lost,\" which was 22 October 2007, *i.e.* the date when the JRP issued its Report.306\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 139.\n\n247.\n\nParticularly, the Respondent argues that using the date of the Award as the valuation date does not put the Investors back in a position as if the breach had not occurred. Rather, it is the valuation based on \"the date immediately prior to the breach\" that will result in full reparation.307 In addition, the Respondent argues that a valuation at the date of the award, as requested by the Investors, would \"[enhance] the problem of hindsight.\"308 This is because the ability to \"choose between the 'better' of two valuation dates\" would allow the Investors \"to select, after-the-fact, which valuation date best resolves the risk they faced.\"309 Accordingly, such approach would result in more speculation and allow the Investors to adjust their business plan solely for the objectives of calculating damages.310 Moreover, the Respondent contends that calculating damages at the date of the Award means that \"none of [the Investors'] profits were subject to any risk prior to [that date].\"311\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 159.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 161.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 161, referring to Brattle Group Rejoinder Report, para. 166 (**Ex.

First, the *Yukos* award has been set aside.312 Secondly, the awards in *ADC* and *Von Pezold* cannot be applied to this case because both awards concern unlawful expropriation cases where the value of the expropriated investments significantly increased after the expropriation took place.313 Lastly, the Respondent points out that all of the cases cited by the Investors involve investments that were going concerns,314 unlike the Whites Point Project, which was in its early development stage.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 159.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 160, referring to *ADC*, paras. 496-497 (**Ex.

CA-332**).\n\n*(c) The United States' Article 1128 Submission*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nGiven the requirement that compensation must be causally related to the breach, the United States suggests that the Tribunal should be cautious when valuing damages at the date of an award instead of at the date of the NAFTA breach in question, as events occurring after the breach may lack \"sufficient causal connection to the breach.\"315\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 27.\n\nii. Market Conditions and Associated Risks\n------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThere is disagreement between the Parties in respect of the market conditions in the New Jersey and New York aggregates markets in the years following the Respondent's breach, the risk associated with the Whites Point Project, and the relevance of such factors for the purposes of determining the Investors' compensation for lost profits.\n\n*(a) The Investors' Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n251.\n\nAs a general matter, the Investors emphasize that \"the fact of a loss\" and \"the quantum of that loss\" are two different elements. That is, while a claimant is obliged to prove on a balance of possibilities that the fact of a loss is certain, it is not required to prove the exact amount of loss with the same degree of certainty, as such quantification is inherently speculative and difficult to prove, and always involves some degree of estimation.\n\n252.\n\nBearing that in mind, the Investors view the market conditions in which they would have operated but for the breach as very favourable ones. They submit that construction spending in New York City and New Jersey \"reached record levels in recent years\"316 and, overall, \"stone imports [in the United States] have been growing at an average annual rate of roughly 8% since 1993.\"317 Similarly, the aggregate production in Nova Scotia has consistently risen since 1925.318 While the Investors admit that the 2008 economic crisis led to difficult years thereafter, they contend that \"the market was rebounding\" by 2012.319 Further, they argue that the market entry of products from the Whites Point Project would not have driven down the overall market price, [REDACTED] Lastly, the Investors argue that given their strong record of success and their expertise in the industry, the Whites Point Project would not have encountered project development and permitting risks as asserted by the Respondent (provided that their investment had received \"fair, honest, and non-discriminatory treatment\" from the Government at the permitting stage).321\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 30, citing Expert Report of Mineral Valuation & Capital, Inc.

It notes that \"market conditions leading up to the global financial crisis were uncertain and that prospects for the aggregates markets were negative,\"324 and that \"[i]n particular, construction spending in the United States was in decline, shipments of aggregate had dropped, and the last quarter of 2007 was the seventh sequential downturn in aggregates demand.\"325 According to the Respondent, this assessment is supported by another operators' decision not to proceed because of the \"Financial Meltdown\", despite its project being released from environmental review in 2007.326 Specifically, citing the Brattle Group Report, the Respondent asserts that \"[s]hipments [of] aggregates had dropped by nearly 20% between 2006 and 2007, and the last quarter of 2007, when the alleged breach occurred, was the seventh sequential downturn for aggregates markets.\"327 The Respondent notes that due to this negative market development the proponents of the Belleoram project decided not to proceed notwithstanding the project approval.328\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 128, referring to Brattle Group Report, para. 160 (**Ex.

Lizak, Wick, and Rosen wrongly focus on the prices of the aggregates in New York in their analyses.332\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2539-2572.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2573, lines 7-13.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2573, line 14 - p. 2574, line 1.\n\n257.\n\nLastly, given the early stage of development of the Whites Point Project when the breach occurred, the valuation has to take into consideration development and permitting risks.333\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 151-157.\n\niii. Projected Production Costs\n-------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Parties disagree significantly as to the projected amount of the costs of the Whites Point Project. While there are various points to note (as summarized below), the principal difference appears to lie in the estimated yield rate of the aggregate production at the Whites Point Project. Whereas the Investors believe that their facilities [REDACTED]\n\n*(a) The Investors' Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n259.\n\nRelying upon the Expert Report of LB&W Engineering Inc. (\"LB&W Report\"), the Investors submit that the total cost for plant and infrastructure was to be US$ [REDACTED] and the total mobile equipment required for operating the Whites Point Project cost was to be US$ [REDACTED] LB&W's calculation is fundamentally based on quarry design information gathered from Messrs. Bickford and Wall.338 The Investors assert that the total costs of running the Whites Point Project can also be found in Exhibit 11 to the Witness Statement of Mr. Dan Fougere (\"Fougere Statement\").339\n\nInvestors' Memorial, paras. 162, 164, referring to LB&W Report, paras. 1, 4, 10, 12; Witness Statement of John Wall, 8 December 2016, para. 62 (\"Wall Statement\").\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2426-2427, citing Witness Statement of Mr. Dan Fougere, 12 December 2016, Exhibit 11 (\"Fougere Statement\").\n\n260.\n\nThe Investors dispute the accuracy of the SCMA Report in respect of the calculation of capital and operating costs. In their view, the SCMA Report miscalculates the yield of marketable aggregate and the number of personnel required to operate the plant, and wrongly uses other quarries as comparators to the automated Whites Point Project. Such miscalculations subsequently result in the overestimation of associated costs.340 Relying upon the Reply Witness Statement of Mr. George Bickford (\"Bickford Reply Statement\"), the Respondent explains how the plant [REDACTED]\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 119-122, referring to SCMA Report.\n\n261.\n\nThe operating costs of the Whites Point Project, which include personnel costs and the maintenance and repair costs over the 50-year lifetime of the Whites Point Project, are specified in tables attached to the Witness Statement of John Wall (\"Wall Statement\"), the Witness Statement of Mr. Paul Buxton (\"Buxton Statement\"), the LB&W Report, and the Expert Report of SNC-Lavalin (\"SNC Report\").343\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 169-72, referring to Wall Statement, paras. 79-80; Wall Statement, Exhibit 8 (**Ex.

Projected Shipping Costs\n----------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the projected costs for shipping aggregate to the New Jersey/New York market. The Investors calculate shipping costs on the basis of estimated freight rates, fuel rates, shipment volumes and average speed. The Respondent argues that the Investors' calculation is based on estimations that are most favourable to the Investors, and provides alternative estimations of the relevant variables.\n\n*(a) The Investors' Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n266.\n\nAccording to the Investors, they planned to ship the aggregate to New York City and New Jersey [REDACTED] In this regard, Mr. Morrison of Tamarack Resource, Director of Marketing & Customer Service at CSL for approximately 20 years, submitted a report [REDACTED]\n\n267.\n\nIn addition, the Investors contend that the Expert Report of Dr. Arlie G. Sterling of Marsoft, Inc. (\"Marsoft Report\") relied upon by the Respondent, is based on faulty assumptions [REDACTED]\n\n*(b) The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nAs for the freight cost, the Respondent, referring to the Marsoft Report, argues that Mr. Morrison [REDACTED]\n\nAs such, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should rely on the Marsoft Report in its decision on the correct estimation freight costs.360\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 150.\n\n269.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent argues that the Investors would have [REDACTED]\n\nv. Discount Rate\n----------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the discount rate to be used in the context of a DCF valuation. While the Respondent argues that there are numerous mistakes in the Investors' calculation of the discount rate, the Investors dispute that differences in their approach to discount rates lead to any methodological flaws.\n\n*(a) The Investors' Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Investors argue that while the FTI Valuation and the Brattle Group Report adopt different approaches in designating the discount rate, this does not lead to \"methodological flaws\".364 In fact, Mr. Rosen has agreed with the Brattle Group Report's approach in one respect\u2014regarding the \"unlevered betas\", which results in a reduction of Mr. Rosen's discount rate from 5.78% to 5.41%. Ultimately, Mr. Rosen submits that, by adopting all the adjustments that the Brattle Group Report points out, the discount rate would decrease from 5.78% to 5.10%.365\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 140, citing Rosen Reply Report, para. 5.72.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 141, citing Rosen Reply Report, paras. 5.72, A2.4-A2.5, A2.17; 5.73, A2.18.\n\n*(b) The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Mr. Rosen made four mistakes when he calculated the discount rate. First, he relied on a backward-looking cost of debt input in calculating forward-looking cash flows. Secondly, he incorrectly calculated the \"unlevered betas\" underlying his own discount rate. Thirdly, he applied a wrong formula to convert his own nominal discount rate to a real discount rate. Lastly, he used only the 2017 and 2018 inflation rates \"when longer-term rates would have been more appropriate.\"366\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 154, citing Brattle Group Report, paras. 124-127 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\nvi. Past Transactions and Other Comparable Transactions in the Market\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Parties disagree over the use of pre-breach transactions or proposed transactions as \"market indicators\" of the value of the Whites Point Project for the purposes of determining the Investors' compensation for lost profits.\n\n*(a) The Investors' Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe Investors assert that these transactions are in no way relevant to their lost profits. They refer to the Expert Reply Report of Mr. Howard Rosen (\"Rosen Reply Report\"), in which Mr. Rosen notes that \"[f]ull reparations are ultimately concerned with the perspective of the Investors rather than the views of the general market.\"367 In any case, according to the Investors, these past transactions referred to by the Respondent do not represent accurate market indicators as they either took place at the time when the Whites Point Project was still at its very early stage or were not in the Investors' interest.368\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 206-207, citing Rosen Reply Report, paras. 4.4-4.5, 4.7.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 208, citing Buxton Reply Statement, paras. 83-84, 88-90, 92-94; Reply Witness Statement of William Richard Clayton, 21 August 2017, paras. 4-5, 7-9, 13-15 (\"Clayton Reply Statement\").\n\n*(b) The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nConversely, the Respondent argues that the Investors' DCF valuation \"is exponentially higher than their past behavior and other market indicators.\"369 Thus, \"[t]hese transactions illustrate the excessive results that the Investors' DCF calculation of lost profits produces.\"370\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 172, citing Brattle Group Rejoinder Report, para. 140, Figure 8 (**Ex. RE-13**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 173, citing Brattle Group Rejoinder Report, para. 122 (**Ex. RE-13**).\n\n**4. The Tribunal's Comments on the Valuation Approaches Proposed by the Parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nAs the Tribunal has noted above, the Investors have failed to prove, to the standard applicable under international law, that the Whites Point Project would have obtained environmental approval. The Tribunal's analysis of the Investors' lost profits claim ends here, as, without a high degree of certainty as to regulatory approval, it goes without saying that no damages based on the profitable operation of the quarry can be awarded.\n\n277.\n\nIn view of the volume of the evidence exchanged by the Parties regarding the business plan for the Whites Point Project's operation, which the Tribunal has carefully reviewed, the Tribunal would nonetheless add that, even in the event of an approval, the long-term future profitability of the Whites Point Project must be regarded as uncertain. This is notably due to (i) possible changes in the Bay of Fundy ecology; (ii) possible new environmental regulations affecting quarry operation and/or shipping; (iii) possible market changes affecting the need for basalt over time; and (iv) possible macro-economic changes that may occur over the five decades of the projected life of the quarry.\n\n278.\n\nWhile uncertainty may in principle be reflected in DCF valuations, many tribunals have declined to resort to DCF valuations of future profits where the investment is not yet a going concern, which has not generated any historic cash flows. In the present case, the uncertainty affecting future income streams is particularly pronounced. Not only was the quarry not a going concern so that future cash flows, positive and negative, are difficult to predict; more significantly, the evidence before the Tribunal is such that the Tribunal cannot, with a sufficient degree of confidence, conclude that the Whites Point Project could have generated long-term profits.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, even if it had found (contrary to its determination above) that environmental approval for the Whites Point Project would have been a virtual certainty, it would nonetheless have declined to award the Investors lost profits/compensation valued in terms of future earnings.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S VALUATION OF THE OPPORTUNITY LOST BY THE INVESTORS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal must now address the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner, which it has found the Investors have lost as a result of the Respondent's breach of NAFTA. There are several indicators of value in the evidence on the record, to which the Tribunal will have regard.\n\n**1. Primary Indicator of Value: Amounts Expended by the Investors**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nAs a first and significant indicator of the value of the lost opportunity, the Tribunal has regard to the expenditures incurred by the Claytons in pursuing the opportunity of developing a quarry site at Digby Neck. From an economic perspective, the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner is broadly equivalent to the value of the opportunity to develop the quarry site subject to the EA, as the EA was a significant milestone on the path toward building the quarry, and there was no other reason to undertake the EA than the intended quarry development. In the Tribunal's view, it is appropriate to take account of all expenses reasonably incurred by the Claytons (i) in the preparation for the environmental assessment, (ii) during the JRP Process, and (iii) immediately after the JRP Process to prevent and react to negative decisions from the Nova Scotia and federal Ministers.\n\n282.\n\nThe rationale for this approach is simple: based on the evidence presented to it, the Tribunal has no doubt that the Claytons have generally conducted their business operations like rational business people. The Tribunal finds that this is also true in respect of their engagement in Nova Scotia. Accordingly, the expenditures incurred by the Claytons, while not conclusive proof of the value of their investment, may be presumed to stand in an objective relationship to the value of the opportunity pursued. The expenditures are, in other words, an indicator for the value that a rational business person would have seen in the opportunity presented by the Whites Point Project in its pre-approval stage.\n\n283.\n\nThe expenditures made by the Claytons in pursuance of the opportunity of the development of a quarry at Digby Neck are not substantially disputed between the Parties. While the Investors' representative in Nova Scotia, Mr. Buxton, estimates the expenditures to amount to C$ [REDACTED] the Respondent's expert arrives at a slightly lower global figure of C$ [REDACTED] The latter figure was confirmed by the CFO of the Clayton Group of Companies (the \"Clayton Group\"), Mr. Forestieri, at the hearing. The Tribunal, having reviewed the compilation of expenditures in Annex C to the Brattle Group Report, adopts the figure of C$ [REDACTED] as a starting point.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that it would be appropriate to take account of additional expenditures that would have been generated in the immediate aftermath of the negative recommendations of the JRP. Following years of engagement with government entities at the federal and provincial level, it was reasonable for the Investors to seek to protect or restore their opportunity by engaging with government officials and ministers in the face of the negative JRP recommendations. In contrast, expenditures that relate to the preparation of a legal case against the Respondent, as they appear to have been occurred as of 2008, are not relevant indicators of the value of the Investors' opportunity. The Tribunal considers that expenditures incurred up to December 2007 should be taken into account in establishing the value of the Investors' lost opportunity.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal is inclined to make a deduction in respect of the remaining value of Nova Stone's share in GQP, which was ultimately absorbed by Bilcon of Nova Scotia. In the Tribunal's view, there is no reason to assume that the value of that stake would have completely disappeared after the JRP's negative recommendations, although one may certainly expect that its value would have declined. The Tribunal understands that nothing would have precluded another company from taking over the lease over the quarry site with a view to developing a quarry itself, at a price that would have reflected the opportunities presented by the site as well as the (by then confirmed) permitting risks.\n\n286.\n\nThe fact that the Investors have not submitted payment slips or receipts in respect of all invoices making up the amount referred to above is not relevant here.373 The Tribunal recalls that it is not seeking to establish the amounts invested by the Claytons with a view to ordering their reimbursement to the entity that paid them. Rather it is seeking to establish the expenditures that were necessary to generate the opportunity lost by the Investors in the present case. Invoices are suitable documentation for the expenditures that were necessary.\n\nBrattle Group Rejoinder Report, Appendix C, Table C.1 (**Ex. RE-13**).\n\n287.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the minimum value of the opportunity lost by the Investors must have been in the order of C$ [REDACTED] (or US$ [REDACTED] corresponding approximately to the amount expended by the Claytons in pursuing the investment in Nova Scotia until it had become apparent in late-2007 that the federal and provincial decisions denying the EA approval would not be reversed.\n\n**2. Secondary Indicators of Value: Past Transactions Regarding the Quarry Site**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe amount of C$ [REDACTED] however, does not reflect any prospect that return on the investment might have been generated in the event of the successful permitting, construction and operation of the Whites Point Project. No reasonable business person would spend over US$ [REDACTED] on an opportunity whose value does not exceed that amount by some reasonable margin. As the *Gemplus* tribunal has noted, even where income-based approaches are inappropriate in view of the uncertainty of future income streams, the prospect of future earnings must not be disregarded entirely. Such prospects inform the value of the opportunity that a claimant has lost.375\n\n*Gemplus S.A., SLP S.A., and Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Cases No. ARB(AF)/04/3), Award, 16 June 2010, paras. 13-70 (\"*Gemplus*\") (**Ex. CA-321**).\n\n289.\n\nIn establishing the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors in the present case, the Tribunal need not rely solely on an \"exercise of its arbitral discretion\",376 as the *Gemplus* tribunal appears to have done. Rather, the Tribunal has the benefit of being able to refer to certain past transactions made in relation to the Whites Point Project site, which allow it to establish an implied value range of the investment opportunity presented by the Whites Point Project, as it was seen by economic operators at different points in time. Three transactions in particular have been discussed by the Parties.\n\n*Id.*, paras. 13-100.\n\n290.\n\nFirst, in 2002, Bilcon of Nova Scotia paid US$ [REDACTED] to acquire a [REDACTED] from Nova Stone. Against this backdrop, Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Nova Stone entered into a [REDACTED] pursuant to which the partnership named GQP was formed (\"2002 GQP Formation\"). The Respondent's expert, Mr. Chodorow, asserts that the total value of the whole business of GQP contingent upon permitting would be US$ [REDACTED] at the time of the transaction in 2002.377 On the other hand, the Investors argue that the purchase price did not reflect the true value of the Whites Point Project as it failed to take into account \"the unique circumstances and qualities of buyers and sellers\", [REDACTED]\n\nBrattle Group Report, para. 75 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\n291.\n\nSecond, in 2004, GQP decided to dissolve its partnership. To complete the dissolution, Nova Stone agreed to sell its [REDACTED] in GQP to Bilcon of Nova Scotia for US$ [REDACTED] (\"2004 GQP Buyout\"). Consequently, according to Mr. Chodorow, the value of the Whites Point Project absent relevant permits in 2004 was roughly US$ [REDACTED] Mr. Buxton however contends that this amount did not reflect the true value of the Whites Point Project [REDACTED]\n\n292.\n\nThirdly, [REDACTED]\n\n293.\n\nMr. Chodorow has provided the following graphical representation of the value implied by each of these transactions. The dark blue column represents the implied value as indexed to the valuation date contended by the Respondent, 22 October 2007:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(*Source: Brattle Group Report, Figure 14*)\n\n294.\n\nIn an alternative calculation, Mr. Chodorow has indexed these same indicators of implied value to the valuation date used by the Investors' expert, Mr. Rosen, which is 31 December 2016:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(*Source: Brattle Group Rejoinder Report, Figure 8*)\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal's task is to establish the value of the Investors' opportunity when they lost it, *i.e.* in late-2007. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds the figures set out in the first graph above, submitted by Mr. Chodorow with his first report, to be more significant for its present purposes. Since the damages awarded to the Investors are subject to interest, which begins to run on 22 October 2007 (*see* paragraphs 316 *et seq.* below), the appreciation of the value of the Investors' opportunity between 2007 and 2018 is, at least partly, accounted for by the award of interest.384\n\nThe Tribunal feels that it should not rely on a value indexed to 2018 *and* award interest starting to run as of 2007, as this might compensate the Investors twice for inflation in the eleven years between the date of the breach and the issuance of the present Award.\n\n296.\n\nAs noted by Mr. Chodorow, the three transactions at issue - [REDACTED]\n\nare not directly comparable to each other, or to the condition of the Project just before the breach, because they reflect different stages of development and assumptions about permitting. The offers, in particular, must be analyzed with care because they do not reflect completed transactions.385\n\nBrattle Group Report, para. 63 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\n297.\n\nIn considering the three transactions at issue, the Tribunal stresses that the 2004 GQP Buyout is the only transaction in which a price was fixed expressly based on an unpermitted quarry. It therefore encompasses fully the permitting risks that were attached to the investment opportunity pursued by the Investors. Moreover, by 2004, the Investors and its joint-venture partner had conducted various geological studies, and could thus be expected to have formed a realistic view of the site's economic potential.386 At the same time the EA process before the JRP, elements of which the Tribunal has found to be inconsistent with NAFTA, was still in its early stages; accordingly, there was little risk that the purchase price would have reflected elements of the JRP's conduct with which the Tribunal has taken issue.\n\nBrattle Group Report, para. 79 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\n298.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also accepts the Investors' argument that the Claytons may have paid less than the market value of the [REDACTED] As Mr. Buxton explains, [REDACTED]\n\n299.\n\nThe implied value of the 2002 GQP Formation, of US$ [REDACTED] was contingent on permitting. Bilcon of Nova Scotia protected itself against permitting risks by limiting the amount of capital it would have to contribute prior to the issuances of permits, and it [REDACTED] Through these contractual mechanisms, Bilcon of Nova Scotia essentially avoided the economic risks of the permitting process. The purchase price it paid is therefore not a reliable indicator of the value of a mere opportunity to participate in a NAFTA-compliant EA process with an uncertain outcome. Moreover, as noted by Mr. Buxton, [REDACTED] \"the environmental approval process would take the form of a Comprehensive Study\".390 To the extent that the 2002 GQP Formation reflects permitting risks at all, such risks would thus have been underestimated. Finally, the Tribunal must bear in mind that, in 2002, the exploration of the quarry site was less advanced than in 2004. Given the more limited knowledge of the parties to the 2002 transaction, it is thus possible that that transaction understates or overstates the value of the Whites Point Project.\n\nBuxton Reply Statement, para. 89.\n\n**3. Conclusions in Respect of Valuation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nHaving regard to the evidential record of the case, the comments by the Parties on it in their written and oral pleadings, and the analysis of Messrs. Chodorow and Rosen, the Tribunal finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors exceeded the amount of C$ [REDACTED] by a reasonable margin.\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers, on the balance of probabilities, that the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors remained below US$ [REDACTED] in light of the early stage of the Whites Point Project's development and permitting risks. While the extent of the permitting risks is difficult to measure, it is telling that market players other than the Claytons, on two occasions in 2002 and 2007, appeared to have been unwilling to absorb permitting risks. This suggests to the Tribunal that such risks were considered significant. The implied values of the two transactions that do not \"price in\" permitting risks must therefore be adjusted downward to serve as indicators of the value of the opportunity pursued by the Claytons.\n\n303.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal determines the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors in respect of the Whites Point Project to be **US$ 7 million**.\n\n**VII. THE REQUESTED TAX GROSS-UP**\n-----------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal must finally address the Investors' request to gross up the amount of any damages for lost profits awarded to them to offset the expected tax treatment of the damages in the United States. The Investors submit that, in order to achieve full reparation, the Tribunal should take into account the tax treatment of lump sum damages in its calculation of the Investors' loss. The Respondent objects to the requested gross-up on grounds of both law and fact. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not consider that a tax gross-up is called for in this case.\n\n**A. THE INVESTORS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nSpecifically, the Investors submit that, in order to achieve full reparation, the Tribunal should take into account the tax treatment of lump sum damages in its calculation of the Investors' loss.392 As the damages will be paid to the Investors, not to Bilcon of Nova Scotia, the Investors add that these damages \"would be considered income of the Bilcon Delaware shareholders either directly or indirectly through Bilcon Delaware,\"393 which will be subject to U.S. tax laws.394 Particularly, the Investors contend that they will not gain any foreign tax credit from the receipt of damages.395 For this reason, the overall effective rate taxable on damages is higher than the overall effective rate of tax payable on profits, which is the direct outcome of the Respondent's breach.396 Thus, the Tribunal should allow a tax equity adjustment so that the Investors are fully compensated.397\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 251, citing Rosen Report, para. 8.1; Investors' Reply, paras. 149-150, citing Expert Report of Stephen Shay, 19 August 2017, paras. 2.5, 6.4.1-6.4.2 (\"Shay Report\").\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 152, quoting from Shay Report, para. 6.3.1.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 153.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 154, citing Shay Report, para. 6.4.1.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 157-158.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 155, citing Shay Report, paras. 2.5, 6.4.2.\n\n306.\n\nAs for the Respondent's contention that the Investors' tax claim is based on the U.S. law that has recently been repealed, the Investors assert that this adjustment does not have \"any effect on the tax equity adjustment as calculated by Professor Shay\".398 In any case, the Respondent asserts that, as a common practice, the valuation of damages must take into account the legislation in place at the time of valuation. Should there be any significant legal development thereafter, the Tribunal should order the expert to modify its calculation in response to the change.399\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2428, lines 7-8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2428, lines 9-23.\n\n307.\n\nThe Investors cite the award in *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v. The Republic of Ecuador* to support their position. In this case, the tribunal ruled that a consideration of taxation is needed to make the claimants whole, provided that the taxes are certain.400 Given that \"in this case, the applicable taxes have been established with certainty, including with regard to the established practice between Canada and the United States under the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention,\" the Investors should be entitled to tax equity adjustment.401 In contrast, the Investors contend that the Respondent's opposition based on the awards in *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. and Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada* and *Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic* is unfounded, as the claimants in those two cases failed to prove the actual tax consequences of the tribunals' awards of damages.402\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 163, referring to *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v.

THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Investors' argument is based on the flawed assumption that the damages awarded to Bilcon of Nova Scotia will subsequently be paid as dividends to its shareholder, Bilcon of Delaware, and in turn be transferred to the other Investors.403 In fact, there is no guarantee that the damages paid to Bilcon of Nova Scotia will be definitely transferred as dividends to the Investors in the United States, and consequently be subject to United States tax as claimed by the Investors.404 In any event, the Respondent argues that the Investors are not entitled to compensation for damage incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia under NAFTA Article 1116.405\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 157.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 158.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 157; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 178.\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent adds that even if the Tribunal were to accept the Investors' argument that the damages owed to Bilcon of Nova Scotia will be transferred as dividends to the Investors, past investment arbitration awards do not support the Investors' request for a tax gross-up.406 The Respondent cites the awards in *Mobil Investments*, *Ceskoslovenska*, and *Rusoro Mining Limited v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* in support of its position.407 According to the Respondent, in those cases the tribunals consistently held that \"tax consequences in a foreign jurisdiction are not relevant to determining the level of compensation.\"408 As for the award in *Chevron* cited by the Investors,409 the Respondent contends that the situations in these cases were not comparable, and the Respondent should not be responsible for another sovereign State's income taxation of damages awarded.410\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 159.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 159; citing *Mobil Investments*, para. 485 (**Ex. RA-127**); *Ceskoslovenska*, para. 367 (**Ex. RA-112**); Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 179-180, citing *Rusoro*, para. 854 (**Ex. CA-345**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 179.\n\n*Chevron*, paras. 306, 311 (**Ex. CA-377**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 181.\n\n310.\n\nAt the hearing on damages in February 2018, the Respondent added that the tax code upon which the Investors rely had been repealed.411 The Respondent added that the possibility that foreign tax legislation can change is another reason why it objects to the Investors' tax gross-up claim.412\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 221, lines 23-24.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2578-2579.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nIn considering the Investors' request for a gross-up of the amount of damages on account of the expected tax treatment of compensation for lost profits, the Tribunal recalls, first, that it has declined to award to the Investors damages based on lost profits, and has instead awarded an amount reflecting the value of the opportunity the Investors have lost.413 Thus, the Parties' analysis of the tax treatment afforded under United States tax law to profits of Bilcon of Nova Scotia has only limited relevance, since no compensation equivalent to lost profits has in fact been granted.\n\n*See* paras. 276-279 above.\n\n312.\n\nSecondly, in *Chevron*, the only award relied upon by the Investors in which a tax gross-up was granted,414 the tribunal grossed up the damages award taking into account the tax law of the *host State*, and not, as requested by the Investors here, the tax law of the *investor's home State*.415 The Tribunal recalls in this context that the Investors concede that no tax issues arise under Canadian tax law. The Shay Report submitted by the Investors confirms that Canadian tax law will not tax a damages award made by the present Tribunal:\n\n[T]*he fact that Canada does not tax damages* means the amount of \"residual\" U.S. tax will be different if Operating Profits are paid after Canadian tax compared with the same cash amount of (as the after-tax Operating Profits) paid as damages not subject to Canadian tax.416 (Emphasis added)\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 163.\n\n*Chevron*, para. 306 (**Ex. CA-377**).\n\nShay Report, para. 4.2.3.2.\n\n313.\n\nTo the extent that tribunals have considered the tax situation in the investor's home State,417 they appear to have concluded that there is no legal requirement on the part of a host country to compensate an investor for taxes incurred there. For instance, the *Ceskoslovenska* tribunal held that \"[i]ncome taxes [...] are unrelated to the obligation of one party to fully compensate the other party\",418 and the *Rusoro* tribunal similarly held that \"[a]ny tax liability arising under [the investor's home country's] tax laws [...], does not qualify as consequential loss\".419 The Tribunal therefore observes that there is no relevant precedent in support of the Investors' claim.\n\n*Mobil Investments*, para. 485 (**Ex. CA-326 / RA-89**); *Ceskoslovenska*, para. 367 (**Ex. RA-112**); *Rusoro*, para. 854 (**Ex. CA-345**).\n\n*Ceskoslovenska*, para. 367 (**Ex. RA-112**).\n\n*Rusoro*, para. 854 (**Ex. CA-345**).\n\n314.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal does not consider that it would have before it all the necessary information to calculate the amount of applicable taxes. The most current expert reports in respect of this issue, submitted by the Investors, are dated August 2017, and they analyze the Investors' tax liability under the tax system then in force in the United States. The tax system in the United States has since undergone changes,420 as was recognized by Mr. Forestieri, Bilcon's CFO, at the hearing.421 The amounts of the Investors' U.S. tax liabilities for the present Award, if any, are thus uncertain.\n\nNotably as a result of the United States' Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Public Law No. 115-97), 22 December 2017.\n\nHearing Transcript, 20 February 2018, p. 401 line 23 - p. 405, line 6.\n\n315.\n\nAccordingly, the Investors' request to indemnify them for any taxes that may apply to the present Award in the United States is denied.\n\n**VIII. INTEREST**\n------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal shall finally address the question as to the suitable interest rate and how such interest rate should be applied to the amount of compensation quantified in the preceding Section.\n\n317.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the Investors are entitled to pre-award interest.422 The Investors have also made submissions on post-award interest,423 which were neither specifically addressed nor contested by the Respondent.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras 147-148; *cf.* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 161.\n\nInvestors' Memorial para. 252; Investors' Reply, para. 148.\n\n318.\n\nBoth sides agree that the Investors' proposed interest rate, the one-year U.S. Treasury bill yield, is appropriate.424 In addition, while the question of whether simple or compound interest should be applied has not been addressed by the Parties themselves, the Parties' experts concur that the yearly compounding of interest would be a reasonable or standard practice.425\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 252; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 161.\n\nRosen Reply Report, para. 7.2; Brattle Group Rejoinder Report, para. 180, fn. 243 (**Ex. RE-13**).\n\n319.\n\nIn relying on the reports prepared by the Parties' experts, the Tribunal is conscious that the experts have considered the appropriateness of pre-award interest in respect of a remedy that is different from the one ultimately ordered by the Tribunal, namely in respect of compensation for future positive cash flows to be generated by the Whites Point Project. Given that, as Messrs. Chodorow and Rosen agree, positive cash flows could not have been generated prior to 2015, any interest on the Whites Point Project's net cash flows can only be calculated from 2015 on.426\n\nRosen Report, para. 7.7; Brattle Group Report, Table 5 (**Ex. RE-5**).\n\n320.\n\nAs described above, however, the Tribunal has decided to award compensation for the loss of the value of the Investors' opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. The Tribunal has already noted that it considers that opportunity to have been lost on 22 October 2007.427 Accordingly, any interest must begin to accrue as of that date. In the Tribunal's view, the experts' positions in respect of the rate of interest, and its compounding, nonetheless offer helpful guidance to the Tribunal in determining the appropriate interest in this case.\n\n*See* paras. 293 and 295 above.\n\n321.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent shall pay to the Investors interest on the principal amount of US$ 7 million,428 at the rate of the average one-year U.S. Treasury bill yield for each corresponding calendar year. Such interest shall begin to accrue on 22 October 2007, and shall run until full payment of the present award has been made. Such interest shall be compounded annually on the first business day of each calendar year.\n\n*See* para. 305 above.\n\n**IX. PERMISSIBILITY OF COMPENSATION TO BE AWARDED UNDER NAFTA ARTICLE 1116**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the relief requested by the Investors in the damages phase of the present arbitration is impermissible under NAFTA Article 1116. In the present case, various possible heads of damage were pleaded, ranging from mitigation costs to process costs, to \"sunk\" investment costs, to lost profit. The Tribunal need not address the permissibility of all these claims under NAFTA Article 1116. Rather, it will focus on the permissibility under Article 1116 of the relief that it has decided to award\u2014namely compensation in an amount equivalent to the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors.\n\n323.\n\nNAFTA Article 1116 provides:\n\n1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n\n(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A,\n\nand that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n2. An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\n\n324.\n\nNAFTA Article 1117 reads:\n\n1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n\n(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A,\n\nand that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n2. An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in paragraph 1 if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.\n\n3. Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the investor or a noncontrolling investor in the enterprise makes a claim under Article 1116 arising out of the same events that gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of the claims are submitted to arbitration under Article 1120, the claims should be heard together by a Tribunal established under Article 1126, unless the Tribunal finds that the interests of a disputing party would be prejudiced thereby.\n\n4. An investment may not make a claim under this Section.\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Investors had originally brought their claim pursuant to NAFTA Article 1116. Specifically, the Investors' Notice of Arbitration, which marks the formal commencement of the arbitration proceedings pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, provides as follows:\n\nPursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL\") Rules of Arbitration and Articles 1116 and 1120 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), the Investors, **WILLIAM RALPH****CLAYTON, WILLIAM RICHARD CLAYTON, DOUGLAS CLAYTON, DANIEL CLAYTON** and **BILCON OF DELAWARE**, initiate recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration.429 (Investors' emphasis)\n\nNotice of Arbitration, 26 May 2008, para. 1.\n\n326.\n\nAt that time, the loss alleged consisted in the higher prices of aggregates to be paid by Bilcon of Delaware as a result of the failure of the Whites Point Project\u2014an injury of the Investors. There is no question (and the Respondent does not dispute) that the original claim was correctly brought under Article 1116.430 In the Memorial, however, the Investors focused on losses to Bilcon of Nova Scotia to establish the amount of compensation owed to the Investors. This has raised the question whether the new damages theory alters the nature of the Investors claim, such that it could only be brought under Article 1117.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 217, line 12 - p. 218, line 11; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 236, lines 4-13; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2499, lines 22 *et seq*.\n\n327.\n\nWhile the Respondent argues that the Investors \"are precluded from personally recovering damages in respect of wrongs done to the corporation [reflective loss]\" pursuant to Article 1116,431 the Investors argue that they actually request damages for their own injury, *i.e.* \"the loss in value of *their* interest in Bilcon of Nova Scotia.\"432 (Investors' emphasis)\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 15.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 340.\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 1116 does not entitle an investor to recover losses incurred by its enterprise, *i.e.* reflective loss. First, as the Investors' claim for damages is based fundamentally on their expert's calculation of losses incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia, *i.e.* reflective loss, the Respondent asserts that the Investors have no standing under Article 1116 and that their claim is \"impermissible\" under Article 1116.433 The Respondent adds that it is irrelevant that Bilcon of Nova Scotia is in effect wholly owned by the Investors, as shareholders are not the only relevant stakeholders in this instance.434 Secondly, according to the Respondent, it follows that the Investors have no standing to seek the lost profits of Bilcon of Nova Scotia, nor can they recover the costs paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia, as they were the enterprise's losses.435 Thirdly, although it recognizes that the Investors had standing under Article 1116 for their original claim, the Respondent argues that as the Investors abandoned this path at a later stage of the proceedings and never provided evidence to substantiate that original claim, they no longer have standing.436 Fourthly, as regards to the Investors' contention that, should its Article 1116 claim fail, the Tribunal should treat their claim as if it were submitted under Article 1117, the Respondent argues that the erroneous framing of their claim is no one's but the Investors' fault. Consequently, the Tribunal should not act as counsel and revise the Investors' pleadings at this late stage of the Arbitration.437 If the Tribunal would allow the Investors to amend and refile their claim under Article 1117, it would be considered \"unduly delayed, time barred and prejudicial to Canada.\"438 For these reasons, the Investors' claim for damages based on their experts' calculation of the amount of loss incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia must fail.439 Also, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal cannot grant an award on sunk costs.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 29-31, referring to Investors' Memorial; Rosen Report; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, pp. 217 *et seq* ; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2491, lines 18-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 32, citing *Case Concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo* (Republic of Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo) (ICJ Reports 2010) Judgement, 30 November 2010, para. 155 (\"*Diallo 2010*\") (**Ex. RA-114**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2492, lines 1-3.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2492, lines 24 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 49.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2492, lines 7-8.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 11.\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent's first argument is that the Investors have no standing under Article 1116 to claim damages for loss incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia. The Respondent argues that Articles 1116 and 1117 deal with distinct matters, which the Tribunal should not conflate. While Article 1116 concerns losses of the investors' (shareholders') interest in relation to the enterprise, Article 1117 concerns losses incurred by the enterprise itself.440 Specifically, the Respondent asserts that: (i) Article 1116 must be read together with Article 1117 as they collectively implement the same principle of corporate law; (ii) Article 1121, if correctly interpreted, supports the Respondent's position; (iii) the distinctive treatment of Articles 1116 and 1117 is consistent with the object and purpose of NAFTA; and (iv) the NAFTA Parties' subsequent agreement and practice are in line with this proposition.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 223, lines 4 *et seq*. ; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2493 *et seq*.\n\n330.\n\nFirst, the Respondent suggests that \"Article 1116 must be interpreted in the context of Article 1117,\" which derogates from the fundamental corporate legal principle of separate legal personality: Article 1117 allows investors to bring claims on behalf of their enterprises for damages suffered by the latter, and the damages awarded shall be paid directly to the enterprises under Article 1135(2).441 Under Article 1116, an investor may recover damages caused by a loss of, *inter alia*, the right to receive dividends, of the right to vote, of an ability to transfer ownership. Under Article 1117, the damages that may be recovered are lost profits or loss of an asset of an enterprise.442 \"Permitting investors to use Article 1116 to recover damages for losses incurred by their enterprise,\" the Respondent notes, would inaptly render Article 1117 \"redundant\" or of \"inutility\".443\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 18, referring to M. Kinnear, A. Bjorklund and J. Hannaford, Investment Disputes under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to NAFTA Chapter 11 (Kluwer, 2006), pp. 1116.4-1116.5 (**Ex. RA-125**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2493 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 21, referring to World Trade Organization, United States - Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline, WT/DS2/AB/R, 29 April 1996, p. 23 (**Ex. CA-125**); Hearing Transcript, p. 228, lines 10-16.\n\n331.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that Article 1117(3) only creates a presumption that Article 1116 and Article 1117 claims arising out of the same events should be consolidated;444 it cannot be interpreted to support the Investors' argument that a claim for reflective loss is permitted, and certainly does not guarantee that, should the claims be consolidated, \"monies paid to the investment should flow through to the investor,\" as contended by the Investors.445\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 31, referring to *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05), Decision on the Requests for Correction, Supplementary Decision and Interpretation, 10 July 2008, para. 21 (**Ex. RA-147**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 30-31.\n\n332.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent rejects the Investors' argument that the interpretation of Article 1116 in the context of Article 1121, entitled \"Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\",446 suggests that claims for reflective loss are permissible. Rather, the Respondent argues, Articles 1121(1) and 1121(2) set out conditions precedent for claims brought under Articles 1116 and 1117 respectively.447 Moreover, the Respondent submits that the phrase \"loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise\" (Respondent's emphasis) pursuant to Article 1121(1)(b) does not refer to \"the enterprise's own interests.\" An \"interest in an enterprise,\" as stipulated in Articles 1121(1)(b), 1139(e) and 1139(f),448 the Respondent adds, means \"the entitlement or right to certain benefits regarding the enterprise\" (such as legal entitlements to receive dividends, vote, ownership, or transfer ownership),449 and does not cover \"fluctuating frequency or amount of dividends\" paid to the enterprise's investors or reflective loss.450 In this case, as Bilcon of Nova Scotia is still in existence, despite being non-operational, the Investors still retain all the legal entitlements in relation to the enterprise. Therefore, they have no standing under Article 1116.451\n\nArticle 1121 provides:  \n1. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if:  \n(a) the investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and  \n(b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.  \n2. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1117 to arbitration only if both the investor and the enterprise:  \n(a) consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and  \n(b) waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1117, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.   \n3. A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.  \n4. Only where a disputing Party has deprived a disputing investor of control of an enterprise:  \n(a) a waiver from the enterprise under paragraph 1(b) or 2(b) shall not be required; and  \n(b) Annex 1120.1(b) shall not apply.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 225, lines 8-16; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2494, lines 12-19.\n\nArticle 1139(e) defines investment as \"an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise\". Article 1139(f) defines investment as \"an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of that enterprise on dissolution, other than a debt security or a loan excluded from subparagraph (c) or (d)\".\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 27; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, pp. 225-226.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 26.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 28-29.\n\n333.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Investors cannot argue that the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117 is a mere formality when it comes to an investment \"wholly owned and controlled by the investors.\"452 Article 1116 does not contain an exception for these kind of investments and so, the tribunal cannot rely on an interpretation that expands its jurisdiction beyond the consent given by the NAFTA Parties, pursuant to Article 1122.453\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 226, lines 13-17.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 226, line 18 - p. 227, line 1.\n\n334.\n\nIn addition, such interpretation would adversely affect other stakeholders (*i.e.* secured and nonsecured creditors, and non-claimant shareholders) of the enterprise. As an example, the Respondent cites Article 1135(2), which provides that any award granted under Article 1117 shall be paid to the enterprise. NAFTA Article 1135(2) protects the interests of others, such as the minority shareholders and the creditors.454 If shareholders were allowed to directly recover their reflective losses, it would introduce \"different priority rankings over corporate assets,\" which in turn would particularly harm creditors as well as minority shareholders455 and unsettle predictability;456 it would also alter tax treatments of the damages paid.457\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 227, line 9 - p. 228, line 2.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 33, referring to D. Gaukrodger, Investment Treaties as Corporate Law: Shareholder Claims and Issues of Consistency, OECD Working Papers on International Investment, No. 2013/3, p. 44 (\"*Gaukrodger* 2013\") (**Ex.

CA-40**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 21, referring to *Mondev*, para. 84 (**Ex. RA-46**).\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the object and purpose of NAFTA of ensuring a predictable commercial framework, promoting conditions of fair competition, and increasing investment opportunities require that the Tribunal maintain a clear distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117. Awarding damages to shareholders for reflective loss\u2014in the present case to the Investors for losses incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia\u2014\"will weaken the corporation's separate legal personality, create unpredictability [for stakeholders], create unfair conditions of competition among these different sorts of investors, and hence inevitably decrease the opportunities for investment in the NAFTA Parties.\"458 In addition, it would \"reduce the assets available to creditors and non-claimant shareholders,\" and lessen the possibility that a settlement be reached between an enterprise and its counterpart, for the settlement would not prevent shareholders from individually pursuing their claims.459\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 26, referring to NAFTA Article 102(1)(b) - (c) (**Ex. RA-47**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 37-38.\n\n336.\n\nThe Respondent additionally points out that the situation of multiple and overlapping claims by minority shareholders is another concern, as this might lead to difficulties in the quantification of damages, risks of double recovery, and inconsistency of awards.460 Lastly, allowing shareholders to claim reflective loss would disturb the corporate management structure, as a shareholder's move might harm the enterprise's interests when its management is of the view that bringing a claim against the State would not be an appropriate strategy.461\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 23, citing *GAMI Investments Inc. v.

RA-119**).\n\n337.\n\nThirdly, pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) and 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), the Respondent asserts that subsequent agreement and practice in the application of NAFTA by the NAFTA Parties must be taken into account.462 In this respect, the Respondent suggests that all three NAFTA Parties treat Articles 1116 and 1117 as distinct provisions and acknowledge that investors can only recover direct damage, not reflective loss, under Article 1116.463 In this respect, the Respondent submits that an interpretation of the Free Trade Commission (\"FTC\") is not the only mechanism from which subsequent agreement and practice of States parties can be inferred.464\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 27, citing A.

In accordance with Article 1122, the NAFTA Parties \"only consent to arbitrate claims submitted in accordance with the procedures of the agreement.\"473 In this case, the tribunal does not have any jurisdiction to hear a claim that the Respondent, the NAFTA Party, has not consented to arbitrate under Article 1116.474\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 42-43, citing *Pope & Talbot*, para. 80 (**Ex.

Government of Canada* the tribunal awarded damages for the investor's own out of pocket expenses.477 It also criticizes the *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada* tribunal's treatment of distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117 as \"almost entirely formal\"478 when these legal provisions on standing are actually concerned with \"what rights ought to be protected and how those rights should be defined\"479 and therefore are not \"trifling technicalities\".480 The Respondent noted that in this case the tribunal never granted an award on damages and \"to the extent that it allowed standing to claim indirect loss, it was wrong, and need not be followed.\"481 By contrast, the Respondent asserts that the *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* tribunal treated the distinction between the two provisions seriously, when it stated that \"a NAFTA tribunal should be careful not to allow any recovery, in a claim that should have been brought under Article 1117, to be paid directly to the investor,\" and that claimants should \"consider carefully whether to bring proceedings under Articles 1116 and 1117.\"482 These statements show, according to the Respondent, that \"if a claim can be brought under Article 1117 for the enterprise's losses, then it must not be brought under Article 1116\".483 As for the *GAMI Investments Inc. v. United Mexican States* award, the Respondent notes that the tribunal warned that permitting an award on reflective loss could lead to several insoluble challenges, like quantifying the amount a minority shareholder could recover, the risk of double recovery and the possibility of inconsistent decisions for the same loss to an enterprise.484\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2496, lines 3-5, referring to *Pope & Talbot*, para. 85 (**Ex.

The Investors have submitted a damages claim for the lost profits of the Whites Point Project, which are the loss of Bilcon of Nova Scotia, but not for any losses they incurred directly. As the Respondent explains, \"any dividends that they never gained are indirect losses based entirely on losses of Bilcon of Nova Scotia.\"485 Consequently, it recognizes that such a claim could have been made under Article 1117, but it is \"impermissible\" under Article 1116.486\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2497, lines 15-17.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2497, lines 1-20.\n\n343.\n\nFor the Respondent it is irrelevant whether the losses of Bilcon of Nova Scotia were reflected in the Investors' tax returns. It is not determinative of whether the damage is direct or indirect. What is determinative is \"whether the right that has been infringed belongs to the shareholder or the corporation.\"487 As the Respondent states \"a foreign jurisdiction's tax treatment for shareholders does not change the fact that the enterprise incurred the loss when it lost the profits.\"488 While the Investors have not gained any dividends from Bilcon of Nova Scotia, they still have retained all their rights and interest in it. Thus, their claim is simply one of indirect loss resulting from the loss incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia and so, they have no standing under Article 1116.489\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2498, lines 8-12, referring to *Barcelona Traction* (**Ex. RA-110**) and *Diallo 2010* (**Ex. RA-114**).\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2498, lines 13-16.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2498, line 13 - p. 2499, line 12.\n\n344.\n\nThe Respondent's third argument is that this claim could have been brought under Article 1117, but the decision not to do so was intentional, as the Investors revealed in their response to the United States' Submission.490 Therefore, the Tribunal should not amend the claim.\n\nInvestors' Response to the United States' Submission, para. 9.\n\n345.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that, contrary to the Investors' assertion that the Respondent should be estopped from raising this objection to jurisdiction at this late stage in the proceedings, the objection is not preliminary but was brought when the Respondent had its earliest opportunity.491 The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to \"hear this claim for compensation as brought by the claimants in the damages phase of the arbitration.\"492\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 237, lines 6-12; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2501 *et seq*.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 237, lines 14-16.\n\n346.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the claim presents a new theory of damages, which is different from the one first submitted by the Investors.493 In paragraph 39 of the Amended Statement of Claim, for example, the Investors stated underneath their \"Damages\" section:\n\nThe effects of these measures on the Investors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The Investors have suffered in excess of US in connection with expenses incurred over more than five years on their application for a permit to build and operate the quarry and marine terminal at Whites Point;\n\nb. The Investors have been deprived of a vital source of basalt aggregate to supply their business operations in the United States. Due to the resulting loss of the supply of basalt, the Investors have experienced a major strategic disadvantage, as the supply of aggregate in the Investors' markets has become consolidated in ever-fewer hands over the course of the environmental assessment process. As a result of this strategic disadvantage, Bilcon may be forced to satisfy market demand at much greater cost.494\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 237, lines 17-25.\n\nInvestors' Amended Statement of Claim, para. 39.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the Investors' Memorial in the Jurisdiction and Liability Phase to presume that the Investors came to the conclusion that investing in the Whites Point Project to obtain a stable and secure supply of aggregate, would be much cheaper - even if it had to be shipped to New Jersey - than acquiring aggregate to supply their operations at market price.495 So the damages they were originally claiming were\n\n[t]heir alleged loss in their Statement of Claim, their sunk costs as investors and the difference between the cost to supply their operations of New Jersey from Whites Point and the cost to supply their operations from purchasing on the open market.496\n\nInvestors' Memorial, para. 770; Witness Statement of William Richard Clayton in the Jurisdiction and Liability Phase, at paras. 4, 31; Hearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 237, line 19 - p. 242, line 8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 242, lines 3-8.\n\n348.\n\nThus, the Respondent concludes that this was the reason why the claim was brought under Article 1116. The Respondent recognizes that the original claim could have been appropriate under Article 1116.497 In order to defend the claim, the Investors would have had to provide evidence of sunk costs paid by the Investors, of actual purchases of aggregate made by the Investors at market prices in New Jersey, and evidence showing how much it would have cost to quarry and ship the same volume of aggregate from Nova Scotia to New Jersey. However, they did not.498 According to the Respondent, the Investors decided to \"trump up a phony business plan solely for the damages phase of this arbitration and make a claim for the lost profits of Bilcon of Nova Scotia.\"499\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2499, lines 24 *et seq*.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 242, lines 9-21; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, pp. 2505 *et seq*.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 243, lines 3-7.\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent nonetheless contends that the claim cannot be amended. The Respondent relies on Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules,500 which provides that\n\nDuring the course of the arbitral proceedings either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances. However, a claim may not be amended in such a manner that the amended claim falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause or separate arbitration agreement.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, pp. 243 *et seq*. ; Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2500, lines 8-14.\n\n350.\n\nThe Respondent concedes that amendments have been generally allowed if there was no undue delay or prejudice to the other party. Nevertheless, it argues that in this case, there has been an undue delay because the Investors knew about the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117, \"professed to have understood, and specifically and intentionally chose to file under Article 1116.\"501 As a result, this claim is \"impermissible\" under Article 1116 and \"it would be entirely unacceptable and prejudicial to Canada to allow the claimants to amend it now and advance a theory of damages that they never before had.\"502\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 244, lines 13-14.\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 244, lines 22-25.\n\n351.\n\nAdditionally, the second sentence of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules would not allow the amendment either. According to the Respondent, the scope of the arbitration clause is Article 1116 and 1117. Both include a time limitation for the submission of claims of three years as of the alleged measures. Since the JRP Report, *i.e.* the breaching measure, was published in 2007, the amended claim would have had to be submitted before 2010. The Tribunal cannot allow to bring a claim to be amended under Article 1117, as it considers it time-barred and outside \"Canada's time-limited consent.\"503\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 245, line 12 - p. 246, line 7.\n\n352.\n\nLastly, the Respondent explains why an award on sunk costs in the JRP Process is not appropriate under NAFTA Article 1116. First, because the vast majority of the expenditures on the Whites Point Project were paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia, constituting the losses of the enterprise. The appropriate standing for awarding these damages would be Article 1117. As a result, the Investors do not have any standing to recover through Article 1116 the losses resulting from the costs paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia.504 Secondly, even if Bilcon of Nova Scotia had standing under Article 1116 for the Whites Point Project's expenditures it had directly paid for, the Investors have not been able to establish an appropriate amount for Bilcon of Nova Scotia's sunk costs. While Mr. Forestieri agreed with the estimates of the amount invested in the Whites Point Project calculated by the Brattle Group, there is no distinction between the costs paid by the Investors and those paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia. The costs which the Investors, instead of the enterprise, paid for some consultants, for example, would not be included in the sunk costs award to Bilcon of Nova Scotia; nor would many of the receipts provided by the Investors which came from Ralph Clayton and Sons Materials LP, a legal entity different from Bilcon of Nova Scotia, be so included.505\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2503, lines 5-18.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2504, line 11 - p. 2505, line 3.\n\n353.\n\nAnother problem for any recovery under Article 1116 noted by the Respondent concerns tax deductions. Since the Investors deducted the losses of Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Bilcon of Delaware in their own tax returns, any damage award would have to be offset by the benefits they gained.506\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2506, lines 13-22.\n\n**B. THE INVESTORS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Investors complain that the Respondent has raised this submission on the \"threshold jurisdictional question of the [I]nvestors' standing under Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA\" for the very first time in the damages phase of this arbitration, instead of the jurisdictional and liability phase. Therefore, the Respondent should be estopped from pleading this argument ten years after the arbitration commenced.507\n\nHearing Transcript, 19 February 2018, p. 125, lines 7-18.\n\n355.\n\nNonetheless, the Investors' submission on this issue is based on two main arguments: that they seek damages for their own loss, *i.e.* \"the loss in value of *their* interest in Bilcon of Nova Scotia,\"508 (Investors' emphasis) and that, in any event, Article 1116 allows the Investors to claim for loss to their interest in an enterprise, *i.e.* reflective loss.509 In the alternative, should the Tribunal not accept these arguments, the Investors argue that the Tribunal should disregard a mere \"procedural defect\" and treat the claim as made under Article 1117.510\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 340.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 341.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 342.\n\n356.\n\nFirst, the Investors assert that their aim is to seek damages for losses incurred by the Investors themselves. In support of their position, the Investors rely on the Expert Report of Mr. Howard Rosen (\"Rosen Report\"). While the Investors admit that Mr. Rosen's valuation is first based on the calculation of Bilcon of Nova Scotia's lost profits, they contend that it subsequently determines \"the money that the Investors would have received from the quarry operations, and the loss of foreign tax credits that would have otherwise been available to the Investors.\"511 [REDACTED]\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 343-347, referring to Rosen Report, paras. 2.5-2.6.\n\n357.\n\nSecondly, the Investors submit that Article 1116 permits recovery of reflective loss. Like the Respondent, the Investors regard their reading of Article 1116 as consistent with Article 31 of the VCLT.515 As regards the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 1116, in light of the context of the provision, the Investors argue that Article 1116 \"does not limit or qualify the concept of loss or damage in any way.\"516 According to the Investors, reading Article 1116 in conjunction with Article 1121(1) confirms this position, because Article 1121(1)(b) stipulates that an investor's claim under Article 1116 can include a claim \"for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly\", although it specifies further that, in order to bring a claim under Article 1116, both the investor and the enterprise must waive their rights to bring another claim concerning the same impugned measure.517 The reading of Article 1117(3) also supports the Investors' argument in their view, since it envisages that the same disputed government measure may bring about a claim under both Article 1116 (for reflective loss incurred by the investor) and Article 1117 (for loss incurred by the enterprise).518 Consequently, the Investors suggest that whether a claim should be brought under either Article 1116 or Article 1117, or both, depends on the context and is subject to the Investors' choice.519\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 349.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 350.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 351-352.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 353.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 355.\n\n358.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that the Investors' interpretation would render Article 1117 redundant, the Investors argue that this would be the case only when claims are brought under both Articles 1116 and 1117.520 In addition, the Investors submit that Articles 1116 and 1117 serve a distinct purpose.521 In particular, Article 1117 grants a national enterprise standing in international arbitration, provided that the claim is brought by foreign investors on its behalf. Additionally, bringing a claim under Article 1117 could be a more suitable option, compared to Article 1116, should the enterprise be a going concern, as damages can be awarded directly to the enterprise.522 By contrast, if the enterprise is no longer operational, a claim under Article 1116 may be perceived as more practical.523\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 356.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 357.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 358.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 359.\n\n359.\n\nWith regard to the object and purpose of NAFTA, relying on the *Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v. United States* case, the Investors submit that \"Chapter 11 of NAFTA need not bear 'the whole weight of the diverse purposes set out in Article 102'\".524 Allowing recovery for reflective loss, the Investors argue, serves the purpose of encouraging better protection of foreign investment.525 Moreover, given that the Investors' interpretation of Article 1116 is in line with its \"settled meaning\" as endorsed by previous arbitral tribunals, applying the provision in this manner would preserve \"a predictable commercial framework\".526\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 360, quoting from *Canadian Cattleman for Fair Trade v. United States*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, IIC 316 (2008), 28 January 2008, para. 166 (\"*Canadian Cattleman*\") (**Ex.

RA-118**).\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 362, 376.\n\n360.\n\nIn support of its position, the Investors additionally rely on three NAFTA proceedings in which Canada served as respondent and raised a similar argument in relation to the recovery of reflective loss: (i) *Pope & Talbot* ; (ii) *SD Myers Inc v. Government of Canada* ; and (iii) *UPS*.527 The Investors submit that in these cases, the tribunals rejected Canada's argument.528 In addition, the Investors refer to two other NAFTA arbitrations in which the same issue was raised by the respondents but was likewise rejected by the tribunals: (i) *Mondev*, and (ii) *GAMI*.529 The Investors thus conclude \"that tribunals have developed a consistent interpretation of Article 1116 that supports the recoverability of reflective loss,\"530 and that this Tribunal should follow this approach to promote consistency, predictability, certainty, and credibility of investment arbitration.531\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 364-366, referring to *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Since there is no relevant FTC decision on the issue, the Tribunal should apply the settled interpretation put forward by the Investors.532\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 378-380.\n\n362.\n\nAddressing the policy considerations adduced by the Respondent, the Investors assert that investment tribunals have generally interpreted investment treaties in a way that allow shareholders to recover reflective loss,533 and that allowing claims for reflective loss is \"particularly important\" where the enterprise is no longer operational.534 That said, even if the Respondent's concerns were valid, the Investors submit that the text of Article 1116 is clear. Accordingly, should the Respondent feel the need to prevent shareholders from claiming for reflective loss, it must do so through amendment of the relevant NAFTA provisions.535\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 381-383, citing D.

Particularly, given that this matter is merely a \"procedural defect\", the Investors' claim should not be dismissed based solely on this ground.538\n\nHearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2445, lines 3 *et seq*.\n\nInvestors' Reply, para. 387.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 388-389, referring to *Mondev*, para. 86 (**Ex.

THE UNITED STATES' ARTICLE 1128 SUBMISSION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nPursuant to NAFTA Article 1128, the United States takes the view that Articles 1116 and 1117 are concerned with \"discrete and non-overlapping types of injury\":\n\nWhere the investor seeks to recover loss or damage that it incurred *directly*, it may bring a claim under Article 1116. However, where the alleged loss or damage is only to an enterprise that the investor owns or controls, the investor's injury is only *indirect*, and therefore, the investor must bring a derivative claim under Article 1117.539 (United States' emphasis)\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 4.\n\n365.\n\nThe United States asserts that all three NAFTA Parties have consistently adopted this position. As a result, pursuant to Article 31(3)(a)-(b) of the VCLT, the Tribunal shall take account of this subsequent agreement or practice of the NAFTA Parties in interpreting Articles 1116 and 1117.540\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 5.\n\n366.\n\nFurther, the United States advises that these provisions were specifically drafted to address two principles of customary international law: (i) that shareholders cannot bring claim for their corporation's loss541 and (ii) that a State's own national cannot bring an international claim against the State.542 In this regard, Article 1117 establishes an unconventional legal regime under which controlling foreign shareholders of a national enterprise of the host State are entitled to submit a claim on behalf of the enterprise for loss incurred by the enterprise.543 Conversely, Article 1116 \"adheres to the principle of customary international law that shareholders may assert claims only for *direct* injuries to their rights.\"544\n\nThe United States' Submission, paras. 6-8, citing *Barcelona Traction* (**Ex. RA-110**) and *Diallo 2010* (**Ex. RA-114**).\n\nThe United States' Submission, paras. 9 -10, citing Jennings & Watts, Oppenheim's International Law (9th ed., 1992), pp. 512-513 (**Ex. CA-270**).\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 11.\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 12.\n\n367.\n\nIn addition, the United States argues that the reference to an investor's \"interest in an enterprise\" under Article 1121(1)(b) is limited to \"legal entitlements or rights belonging to the investor (not the enterprise).\"545 The United States notes that this position also serves various policy objectives, such as the preservation of the separate legal identity of a corporation, the promotion of judicial economy, and the protection of other stakeholders.546 To support its position, the United States particularly cites the awards in *Mondev* and *GAMI*, which adopted a cautious approach in determining the shareholders' claims for losses incurred by their enterprises.547\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 13, referring to the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1139, which includes \"an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise\" and \"an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of that enterprise on dissolution\" within the definition of investment.\n\nThe United States' Submission, paras. 15-20.\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 21, referring to *Mondev*, paras. 84, 86 (**Ex. CA-40**); *GAMI*, paras. 116-121 (**Ex. CA-15**).\n\n368.\n\nLastly, the United States emphasizes that a decision to file a claim under either Article 1116 or 1117 is a serious choice to be made by an investor. It substantially affects subsequent litigation strategies and a NAFTA Party's consent to arbitrate, which hinges upon the different procedural requirements specified under each provision. In particular, such consent \"is limited to a claim for loss or damage available under the specific article(s) pled.\"548\n\nThe United States' Submission, para. 22.\n\n**D. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal is whether damages can be claimed in this case under NAFTA Article 1116. While the Investors initially brought their claim under Article 1116 in respect of their loss resulting from having to pay higher costs for aggregates as a result of the failure of the Whites Point Project, their claim in their Memorial focused on loss to Bilcon of Nova Scotia. This has led the Respondent to characterize the claim as one for \"reflective loss\" claimable only under Article 1117.\n\n370.\n\nNAFTA Article 1116 permits claims by an investor where there has been a breach of NAFTA and \"the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\". NAFTA Article 1117 permits claims by an investor in respect of an enterprise that it controls directly or indirectly where there has been a breach of NAFTA and \"the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\".\n\n**1. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nThe starting point for the interpretation of Articles 1116 is Article 31(1) of the VCLT under which treaties are to be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The critical question in this case is the meaning of \"the investor has incurred loss or damage\" arising out of the breach. The terms of Article 1116 do not make clear whether they are limited to direct loss or they can include indirect loss that is, reflective loss.\n\n372.\n\nHowever, if the words of Article 1116 are to be read \"in their context\" then Article 1117 has to be considered. This provision allows an investor to claim for loss to an enterprise thus providing for the recovery of reflective loss. As a result, to permit reflective loss to be recovered under Article 1116 would raise questions about the relationship between the two provisions perhaps rendering Article 1117 inutile. This is the point made by the Respondent. The Investors argue that the potential for conflict only arises when claims are brought under both Article 1116 and Article 1117, but this only reinforces the question of why Article 1117 was included into NAFTA if claims can be brought for reflective loss under Article 1116.\n\n373.\n\nBoth the Respondent and the United States in their submissions argue that the inclusion of separate provisions in Article 1116 and Article 1117 was deliberate. Article 1116 gave effect to the traditional rule of customary international law that a party can sue for its losses arising out of the breach of an international obligation. Article 1117 was designed to permit claims by an investor on behalf of its investment, thus permitting a claim for reflective loss. In the absence of that provision a claim for reflective loss would otherwise be barred under customary international law by virtue of the ICJ judgment in *Barcelona Traction*, which rejected the right of shareholders to bring claims in place of the corporation.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this to be a plausible explanation for the existence of the two separate provisions in NAFTA Chapter Eleven, which would argue against overlap between them and would mean that reflective loss could not be recovered under Article 1116.\n\n375.\n\nBoth Parties invoke the object and purpose of NAFTA in support of their position. The Respondent claims that ensuring a predictable commercial framework, promoting conditions of fair competition, and increasing investment opportunities all point to making a clear distinction between Article 1116 and Article 1117. However, the Investors argue that allowing recovery for reflective loss serves the purpose of encouraging better protection of investment. The Tribunal considers neither approach particularly helpful in the interpretation of Article 1116.\n\n**2. Subsequent Practice**\n--------------------------\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent and the United Sates reinforce their position on the interpretation of Article 1116 by arguing that it is confirmed by the consistent subsequent practice of the NAFTA Parties in their submissions to investor-State tribunals.549 The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent and the United States in this regard, notwithstanding the fact that subsequent practice is only one of several elements established by Article 31 of the VCLT to consider when interpreting a treaty.\n\nThe Government of the United Mexican States has chosen not to make any Article 1128 Submission to this Tribunal, having been duly invited to do so by the Tribunal on 9 November 2017.\n\n377.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Investors' argument550 that the power of the FTC to make authoritative interpretations of NAFTA replaces the rule in Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT that \"subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" shall be taken into account \"together with the context\". The NAFTA Parties have an option to make a binding interpretation under Article 1131(2) but the fact they have not done so means that treaty interpretation simply follows the normal interpretative rules, which include taking account of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice of the parties.\n\nInvestors' Reply, paras. 378-379.\n\n378.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the commentary to the ILC draft conclusions on \"Subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties\" includes \"statements in the course of a legal dispute\" as potentially relevant subsequent practice of States for the purposes of interpretation.551\n\nReport of the ILC, Seventieth Session, UN Doc. A/73/10, Chapter VI, para. 18.\n\n379.\n\nOn this basis, the consistent practice of the NAFTA Parties in their submissions before Chapter Eleven tribunals in making a clear distinction between the application of Article 1116 and Article 1117 can be taken into account in interpreting the provisions of NAFTA. Thus, the NAFTA Parties' subsequent practice militates in favour of adopting the Respondent's position on this issue, although only analyzing subsequent practices does not replace the primary rule of interpretation of Article 31(1).\n\n**3. NAFTA Chapter Eleven Jurisprudence**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nAs the Parties have pointed out, the distinction between Article 1116 and Article 1117 has been discussed by a number of NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals.\n\n381.\n\nIn *Pope & Talbot*, a U.S. company (Pope & Talbot Inc.), having a subsidiary in Canada (Pope & Talbot Ltd.), claimed for losses caused by Canada's export control regime for softwood lumber, which implemented the 1996 Softwood Lumber Agreement between Canada and the United States. Canada, the respondent in that case, argued that, since the investor had brought its claim under Article 1116, it could not recover damages incurred by its Canadian subsidiary.552 The tribunal found Canada's argument unconvincing for two reasons. First, the language of Article 1117 was permissive: it only provides that an investor, on behalf of its enterprise in the host State, \"may submit to arbitration.\"553 Secondly, the wording of Article 1121(1) did not support Canada's case. The tribunal concluded:\n\nIt could scarcely be clearer that claims may be brought under Article 1116 by an investor who is claiming for loss or damage to its interest in the relevant enterprise, which is a juridical person that the investor owns. In the present case, therefore, where the investor is the sole owner of the enterprise..., it is plain that a claim for loss or damage to its interest in that enterprise/investment may be brought under Article 1116. It remains of course for the Investor to prove that loss or damage was caused to its interest, and that it was causally connected to the breach complained of. But for immediate purposes the important point is that the existence of Article 1117 does not bar bringing a claim under Article 1116.554\n\n*Pope & Talbot*, paras. 75-78 (**Ex. CA-39**).\n\n*Pope & Talbot*, para. 79 (**Ex. CA-39**).\n\n*Pope & Talbot*, para. 80 (**Ex. CA-39**).\n\n382.\n\nThe dispute in *Mondev* concerned the claim of a Canadian investor, Mondev International Ltd, for losses caused by the City of Boston in the context of a land development project operated by Mondev's U.S. subsidiary. The claim was brought pursuant to Article 1116. Objecting to the tribunal's jurisdiction, the United States argued that the claim should instead have been brought under Article 1117. The United States emphasized \"the importance of the distinction between claims brought by an investor of a Party on its own behalf under Article 1116 and claims brought by an investor of a Party on behalf of an enterprise under Article 1117. The principal difference relates to the treatment of any damages recovered.\"555\n\n*Mondev*, para. 84 (**Ex. CA-40**).\n\n383.\n\nIn this regard, the *Mondev* tribunal stated, \"a NAFTA tribunal should be careful not to allow any recovery, in a claim that should have been brought under Article 1117, to be paid directly to the investor.\"556 The tribunal however noted that, even if the claim was brought under Article 1116 in such circumstances the same objective could easily be achieved and the tribunal was prepared to do so, by treating the claimant's claim under Article 1116 as if it were brought in the alternative under Article 1117. In other words, the tribunal appeared to treat the difference between Articles 1116 and 1117 as a mere formality, stating that \"[i]nternational law does not place emphasis on merely formal considerations, nor does it require new proceedings to be commenced where a merely procedural defect is involved.\"557 While the tribunal advised that it \"would have been prepared, if necessary, to treat Mondev's claim as brought in the alternative under Article 1117,\" it cautioned that prospective claimants should take account of the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117:\n\nIt is clearly desirable in future NAFTA cases that claimants consider carefully whether to bring proceedings under Articles 1116 and 1117, either concurrently or in the alternative, and that they fully comply with the procedural requirements under Articles 1117 and 1121 if they are suing on behalf of an enterprise.558\n\n*Mondev*, para. 86 (**Ex. CA-40**).\n\n*Mondev*, para. 86 (**Ex. CA-40**).\n\n*Mondev*, para. 86 (**Ex. CA-40**).\n\n384.\n\nIn *S.D. Myers*, a U.S. investor, S.D. Myers Inc. (\"SDMI\"), set up a subsidiary in Canada (*i.e.* Myers Canada Ltd.) to import Polychlorinated biphenyl (\"PCB\") waste from Canada for treatment in the United States. SDMI commenced arbitration pursuant to Article 1116, claiming for losses resulting from Canada's interim prohibition of the export of PCB waste to the United States. The tribunal in *S.D. Myers* briefly addressed the relationship of Articles 1116 and 1117 under the heading of causation:\n\nArticle 1116 is relevant to the scope of recovery. It states that an investor can claim for: *...loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of...* a breach of Section A of Chapter 11. Article 1117, which is not in issue in this arbitration, provides the same remedy when an investor claims on behalf of its investment.559 (Emphasis in original)\n\n*S.D. Myers II*, para. 143 (**Ex. CA-205**).\n\n385.\n\nBy contrast, the matter of derivative claims was at the heart of the parties' dispute in *GAMI*. A U.S. minority shareholder, GAMI Investments Inc. (\"GAMI\"), claimed for losses of the value of its shares in Grupo Azucarero Mexico SA de CV (\"GAM\"), a Mexican company, due to Mexico's expropriation of mills owned by GAM. The tribunal first addressed Article 1116 in the context of jurisdiction, holding that \"the fact that a host state does not explicitly interfere with share ownership is not decisive. The issue is rather whether a breach of NAFTA leads with sufficient directness to loss or damage in respect of a given investment.\"560 The tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over GAMI's claim for its losses.561 The tribunal returned to the issue of derivative claims in addressing GAMI's expropriation claim. In this regard, it identified certain difficulties attributable to the derivative nature of shareholder claims. First, the tribunal was concerned about the allocation of compensation between a shareholder and its subsidiary, especially in a situation where \"unsynchronised resolution\" of the same dispute by national and international jurisdictions was a \"practically certain scenario.\"562 Second, given that no dividend had ever been paid by GAM to its shareholders, it was not clear why \"GAMI's recovery [should] be debited on account of a payment to GAM.\"563 Ultimately, the tribunal did not have to decide these issues, as it held that the claimant had failed to prove that Mexico breached its NAFTA obligations.564\n\n*GAMI*, para. 33 (**Ex. CA-15**).\n\n*GAMI*, para. 43 (**Ex. CA-15**).\n\n*GAMI*, paras. 116-121 (**Ex. CA-15**).\n\n*GAMI*, para. 118 (**Ex. CA-15**).\n\n*GAMI*, para. 137 (**Ex. CA-15**).\n\n386.\n\nIn *UPS*, a U.S. company, United Parcel Service of America Inc. (\"UPS\"), operating through two subsidiaries in Canada (United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. (\"UPS Canada\"), and Fritz Starber Inc.), brought a case under Article 1116 claiming for losses resulting from Canada's measures in relation to UPS Canada. Canada objected to jurisdiction on the ground that UPS should have brought its case pursuant to Article 1117 as the conduct complained of \"primarily affects UPS Canada rather than UPS.\"565 The tribunal disagreed. Having made the observation that \"UPS is the sole owner of UPS Canada,\" it held that, at least in this case, the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117 was a purely formal one:\n\n[The distinction] is without any significant implication for the substance of the claims or the rights of the parties. UPS is the sole owner of UPS Canada. As such, it is entitled to file a claim for its losses, including losses incurred by UPS Canada. If there were multiple owners and divided ownership shares for UPS Canada, the question of how much of UPS Canada's losses flow through to UPS - the question posed by Canada here - may have very different purchase. Whether the damage is directly to UPS or directly to UPS Canada and only indirectly to UPS is irrelevant to our jurisdiction over these claims.566\n\n*UPS*, para. 32 (**Ex. CA-89**).\n\n*UPS*, para. 35 (**Ex. CA-89**).\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes from the above that no consistent position on the distinction in the scope of application of Article 1116 and Article 1117 has emerged in the Chapter Eleven cases. In neither *Pope & Talbot* nor *UPS* was a claim to reflective loss seen as precluded under Article 1116. Yet, in both *Mondev* and *GAMI* the distinction between the two provisions was seen as important. However, in both *Pope & Talbot* and *UPS*, the tribunals emphasized the fact that the claimants were the sole investors in the subsidiary. And, in *Mondev*, the tribunal warned against allowing any recovery being paid to the investor where the claim had been brought under Article 1116.\n\n388.\n\nThe tribunal's warning in the *Mondev* award not to allow payment of compensation to the investor in the context of a claim made under Article 1117 shows the importance of distinguishing claims for reflective loss under Article 1117 from claims under Article 1116. As the Respondent points out, to allow an investor to recover under Article 1116 damages that belong to its investment could have an impact on other stakeholders, including other investors in the investment. That is the reason why recovery of monetary damages in respect of claims made under Article 1117 are to be paid to the investment vehicle and not to the investor pursuant to Article 1135(2)(b). The lack of any equivalent provision in relation to Article 1116 carries the implication that reflective loss was not contemplated under Article 1116.\n\n389.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is persuaded that the Respondent and the United States are in principle correct. Articles 1116 and 1117 are to be interpreted to prevent claims for reflective loss from being brought under Article 1116. This follows from the wording of Article 1116 in its context, which includes Articles 1121 and 1135. Moreover, the Tribunal takes account of the common position of the NAFTA Parties in their submissions to Chapter Eleven tribunals.\n\n**4. The Relief Awarded in the Present Case**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe question arises whether the relief requested by the Investors in the damages phase of the present arbitration is impermissible under NAFTA Article 1116.567 As already noted above, various possible heads of damage were pleaded, ranging from mitigation costs to process costs, to sunk investment costs, to lost profit. The Tribunal need not address the permissibility of all these claims under NAFTA Article 1116. Rather, it will focus on the permissibility under Article 1116 of granting the relief that it has decided to award\u2014namely compensation in an amount equivalent to the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, the claim was brought pursuant to Article 1116. At that time, the loss alleged consisted of the higher prices of aggregates to be paid by Bilcon of Delaware as a result of the failure of the Whites Point Project - an injury of the Investors. There is no question (and the Respondent does not dispute) that the original claim was correctly brought under Article 1116. In the Memorial, however, the Investors focused on losses to Bilcon of Nova Scotia to establish the amount of compensation owed to the Investors. This has raised the question whether the new damages theory alters the nature of the Investors claim, such that it could only be brought under Article 1117.\n\n391.\n\nWould the award of compensation in an amount equivalent to the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner be an award of reflective loss? In the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal does not consider that to be so.\n\n392.\n\nFirst, it is clear that the opportunity to develop and submit the Whites Point Project for approval was entirely an opportunity of the Clayton Group in New Jersey, which is owned and run by the individual claimants in this case. They prospected quarry sites and invested their money in the opportunity.\n\n393.\n\nSecondly, all of the dealings between the Canadian and Nova Scotia authorities considering the location of, and establishing the necessary approvals for, the investment were conducted by or on behalf of the Clayton Group.\n\n394.\n\nThirdly, while for largely administrative reasons, the Investors conducted some of their dealings through Bilcon of Nova Scotia, the sole purpose of Bilcon of Nova Scotia was to build and operate a quarry, a role that it never got to fulfill. It was not an entity set up to establish and manage an investment in a quarry and a marine terminal with the Claytons just as passive investors. The fact that the Claytons used a local enterprise as an instrument for pursuing their opportunity, however, does not turn that opportunity into Bilcon of Nova Scotia's opportunity. Bilcon of Nova Scotia was no more than a conduit to facilitate the Claytons' operations.\n\n395.\n\nFourthly, to regard Bilcon of Nova Scotia as a separate entity in every respect would not be consistent with the facts of the case. As far as the Tribunal is concerned, the Clayton Group was not structured that way, nor did the Clayton brothers organize their involvement in the Clayton Group in such manner.\n\n396.\n\n[REDACTED] The opportunity to invest in a quarry and a marine terminal, which was denied by the Respondent's unlawful conduct, was an opportunity of the Investors and not an opportunity of Bilcon of Nova Scotia. Accordingly, compensation is owed directly to the Investors pursuant to Article 1116. It is not precluded by the prohibition against awarding \"reflective loss\".\n\n397.\n\nIn light of these conclusions, the Tribunal sees no need to address the Investors' contentions that the Respondent's argument that the damages claim under Article 1116 has been brought too late, or that the Tribunal should treat the claim as one made under Article 1117.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n398.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides, in relevant parts:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n399.\n\nHaving consulted with the Parties at the hearing on damages, the Tribunal has decided to fix the costs of arbitration, and to determine their allocation, in a separate, final award on costs. The Parties will be invited to file specific briefs regarding the costs of arbitration, taking into consideration the Tribunal's rulings in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award on Damages and any other circumstances that they regard as relevant.\n\nXI. DISPOSITIF\n--------------\n\n400.\n\n**In light of the foregoing, and having considered the Parties' arguments and the evidence before it, the Tribunal unanimously decides:**\n\n**a) The Respondent shall pay to Mr. William Richard Clayton, Mr. Douglas Clayton, Mr. Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. the amount of US$ 7 million as compensation for the Respondent's breaches of NAFTA established in the Tribunal's Award on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 17 March 2015;**\n\n**b) The Respondent shall pay interest on this amount at a rate of the average one-year U.S. Treasury bill yield for the corresponding calendar year, accruing annually on a compounded basis, starting on 22 October 2007 and until full payment has been made;**\n\n**c) All other claims are dismissed;**\n\n**d) Any decision on the costs of arbitration is deferred to a final award on costs.**"}]}
