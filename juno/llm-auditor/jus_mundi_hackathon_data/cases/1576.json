Those two findings are that: (i) the Claimants are entitled to a further award of compensatory damages in this ICSID Arbitration for the same loss in respect of which they have already received full compensation in the SCC Arbitration; and (ii) the Respondent violated the umbrella clause in The Netherlands/Georgia BIT on the basis of a breach of contract established in the SCC Arbitration (a finding of strict liability based on the \"elevation theory\" of the umbrella clause).\n\nI do not join the majority in their interpretation of the investment treaty obligations in the Award but as our differences do not change the outcome save as for the umbrella clause I will focus exclusively on that obligation in this dissenting opinion.\n\n**B DOUBLE COMPENSATION FOR A SINGLE LOSS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal has awarded damages twice for the same loss.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants Gardabani and Telasi brought claims for breach of contract under the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum, respectively, and were awarded USD 27,499,000 and USD 84,500,000 plus interest for these losses in the SCC Arbitration. The Final Award in the SCC Arbitration was rendered on 9 September 2022. The Claimants Gardabani and Silk Road (which owns 75.11% of Telasi) also pursued a claim for breach of the umbrella clause on the theory that the same breaches of contract are elevated to a breach of The Netherlands/Georgia BIT in the ICSID Arbitration. The ICSID Arbitration was consolidated with the SCC Arbitration before the same Tribunal. The majority today has awarded the Claimants the same damages again for the same loss in the SCC Arbitration.2\n\nThe only difference is that, in relation to Silk Road, the amount is reduced because it is shareholder of Telasi and the damages are calculated on a Free Cash Flow to Firm basis. In my dissenting opinion in the SCC Arbitration, I concluded that the amount awarded to Telasi by the majority represented a windfall that no party expected at the time the 2013 Memorandum was executed (the whole rationale of that contract was to guarantee to Telasi the recovery of its costs plus a reasonable rate of return and the parties had made detailed forecasts of what that was to mean in practice over the life time of the contract) and that the proper interpretation of the key terms of the 2013 Memorandum excluded the possibility of awarding that windfall.\n\n4.\n\nIt might have been expected when the parties in this case agreed to consolidate the contractual claims and the treaty claims into a single procedure before a single tribunal that that tribunal would avoid rendering awards that are contradictory and mutually exclusive. The SCC and ICSID Awards are contradictory and mutually exclusive because everyone agrees that they cannot both be enforced. The majority, however, considers that any mischief that might attend this state of affairs is eliminated by the Claimants' assurance that they will not seek double recovery. I do not agree.\n\n5.\n\n**First**, it is now open to the Claimants to seek the enforcement of each award in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. It is by no means certain that any undertaking on the part of the Claimants not to pursue double recovery will eliminate the risk of such. The Tribunal is *functus officio* upon the issuance of the ICSID Award and cannot supervise or enforce any undertaking given by the Claimants. Relying upon national judges in different jurisdictions (with powers, among other things, to order *ex parte* relief in enforcement proceedings) to somehow coordinate their actions to prevent double recovery is unrealistic. Even if one award is paid in full, how might the Claimants be compelled to give up their legal rights under the other award, which will remain valid and binding? To put all this in context, the Russian Federation is standing behind the Claimants, and the Georgia is the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\n**Second**, an arbitral award for a sum of money is a chose-in-action. It is a property right. It can be assigned to a third party and enforced by that third party.3 The Claimants' personal assurance about not pursuing double recovery operates *in personam* and has no impact on the proprietary rights created by each Award. What is the value of the Claimants' undertaking in circumstances where one or both Awards are assigned to third parties?\n\nE.g. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentina*, 902 F Supp 2d 367, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) where the rights of the assignee to enforce the award were upheld. At least four more ICSID awards against Argentina are known to have been assigned.\n\n7.\n\n**Third**, the majority's findings of liability and their quantification of damages in the ICSID Award are entirely parasitical upon their conclusions in the SCC Award. In other words, if they are wrong in the SCC Award about the interpretation of the contracts and the quantification of damages flowing from any breach, then they are also wrong in the ICSID Award. This is the consequence of their strict liability approach to the umbrella clause: a breach of contract is automatically a breach of the umbrella clause with the same entitlement to compensation. The SCC Award is currently being challenged before the courts at the seat of the arbitration in Stockholm. Suppose that challenge is successful, is it fair that the Claimants will possess the second ICSID Award for the same damages to enforce regardless? Is it fair that the Respondent will then be compelled to mount a separate challenge to the ICSID Award in order to resist enforcement?\n\n8.\n\nGiven (i) the serious practical and legal problems attending the existence of two awards of damages for the same loss, (ii) the considerable scope now granted to the Claimants to amplify the existing dispute by launching multiple and conflicting enforcement proceedings or assigning one or more of the awards to third parties who might be incentivized to do the same and, (iii) the absence of any precedent of a tribunal embarking upon this course of action in consolidated proceedings, one might expect that the legal principle invoked to cement the Claimants' right to two awards of damages for the same loss would be rather robust.\n\n9.\n\nBut it is not. The sole legal principle relied upon by the majority to justify awarding double the damages for a single loss is the distinction between contract claims and treaty claims. That distinction is a truism; it does not provide an answer to any specific legal problem. Pretending otherwise means that slogans will triumph over substance in the adjudication of investment disputes.\n\n10.\n\nContract claims have a different legal foundation to tort claims as well and yet there is unlikely to be a legal system that would allow a claimant to obtain a judgment for damages in respect of a loss resulting from a breach of contract, and then to pursue the respondent for a second judgment for damages in relation to exactly the same loss but on the basis of a delictual theory of liability. Some legal systems recognize a principle of concurrent liability in the sense that the same set of facts may give rise to claims in contract and tort (e.g. England after *Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd*4); others eschew the possibility of concurrent actions (e.g. France and the principle of \"*non-cumul des responsabilit\u00e9s contractuelle et d\u00e9lictuelle*\"5). But no legal system to my knowledge allows a claimant to obtain two judgments awarding full compensation for the same loss against a single respondent.\n\n[1994] 3 WLR 761.\n\nE.g. Cass. com., 4 d\u00e9cembre 2019, n\u00b017-20.032.\n\n11.\n\nA contract claim and a claim for breach of the umbrella clause have the same remedial objective: compensation for a particular loss suffered. In the circumstances where legal systems do allow the combination of remedies, it is because the remedies in question have different objectives. For instance, English law allows the combination of compensatory and exemplary damages (an exceptional remedy with the objective of punishing, deterring and expressing disapproval for a civil wrong).6 If the Claimants were to enforce both awards in these proceedings, then sums recovered in the second award would effectively amount to exemplary or punitive damages, despite the fact that international law does not recognize either.7 It does seem rather extreme that the Claimants have been granted a valid, binding and enforceable right to obtain exemplary or punitive damages subject only to their undertaking of self-restraint that the Tribunal will have no jurisdiction to supervise or enforce.\n\nS Watterson, 'Alternative and Cumulative Remedies: What is the Difference?' (2003) 11 *RLR* 7.\n\n*Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v Honduras (Compensation)* (1989) *Inter-Am. Ct.H.R., Series C, No 7*, 52.\n\n12.\n\nThe majority has offered no reason why the distinction between contract and treaty claims compels this result. Why should that be the position under international investment law? Why is it necessary to achieve justice between the parties to award damages twice for the same loss? No explanation is provided. As a matter of substantive law, it is not a result that is countenanced by the general principles of law of major legal systems in respect of the analogous instance of concurrent liability in contract and in tort. But it is also inconsistent with general principles of procedural law designed to prevent an abuse of process, which are finally attracting the attention of tribunals and scholars.8\n\nE.g. E Gaillard, 'Abuse of Process in International Arbitration' (2017) 32 *ICSID Review* 17; Y Fukunaga, 'Abuse of Process under International Law and Investment Arbitration' (2018) 33 *ICSID Review* 181.\n\n13.\n\nIn *Ampal-American Israel Corporation v Arab Republic of Egypt*,9 the tribunal hearing claims under the US/Egypt BIT had to consider a plea of abuse of process on the ground that there were claims against Egypt in parallel proceedings under the Poland/Egypt BIT brought by other entities in the same corporate chain as Ampal in relation to the same underlying dispute and same alleged loss. The tribunal said that this was \"*tantamount to double pursuit of the same claim in respect of the same interest*\".10 The tribunal continued:\n\nIn the tribunal's opinion, while the same party in interest might reasonably seek to protect its claim in two fora where the jurisdiction of each tribunal is unclear, once jurisdiction is otherwise confirmed, it would crystallize in an abuse of process for in substance the same claim is to be pursued on the merits before two tribunals.11\n\nICSID Case No ARB/1/12/11, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 February 2016.\n\nIbid \u00a7331.\n\nIbid \u00a7331.\n\n14.\n\nThe tribunal then directed Ampal to elect to pursue the overlapping portion of its claim exclusively in one or another forum.12\n\nIbid \u00a7339.\n\n15.\n\nIn *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*,13 which the majority has summarized in the ICSID Award,14 there was a similar scenario of multiple entities in the same corporate chain claiming damages for the same underlying loss. The tribunal found that certain claims were inadmissible and the pursuit of them constituted an abuse of right. The tribunal found that, whilst it may be legitimate to structure an investment through several layers of corporate entities, \"*[t]his possibility\u2026 does not mean that the host state has accepted to be sued multiple times by various entities under the same control that are part of the vertical chain in relation to the same investment, the same measures and the same harm*\".15 Further:\n\n[W]here multiple treaties offer entities in a vertical chain similar procedural rights of access to an arbitral forum and comparable substantive guarantees, the initiation of multiple proceedings to recover for essentially the same economic harm would entail the exercise of rights for purposes that are alien to those for which these rights were established.16\n\nICSID Case No ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017.\n\nAward, \u00a7476.\n\nICSID Case No ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, \u00a7542.\n\nIbid \u00a7543.\n\n16.\n\nThe majority says that all this is irrelevant in the present case for two reasons. The first is that we are concerned with a contract claim and a treaty claim rather than multiple treaty claims.17 But this is an argument of form over substance. The object of the contract claim and the treaty claim in this case is identical: for the Claimants to be put in the position as if the contract in question had been fully performed by an award of compensatory damages. There is no dispute that the Claimants fully achieved that object in the SCC Arbitration. According to the majority:\n\nThe Claimants say that damages for treaty and contractual breaches must restore claimants to the economic position they would have been in had the breaches not occurred\u2026\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the Parties' submissions on damages and in their Experts' joint reports, the Tribunal fixed the compensation payable by the Respondents for breach of contract in the SCC Final Award. The damages claimed by Silk Road and Gardabani in this arbitration under the umbrella clause in the BIT relate to the same underlying obligations and, with one exception, have been calculated in the same manner.18\n\nAward, \u00a7\u00a7475-6.\n\nAward, \u00a7745, \u00a7748.\n\n17.\n\nIt is also obvious from the manner in which tribunals in cases such as *Ampal v Egypt* and *Orascom v Algeria* treated the problem of the multiplicity of actions in respect of a single loss that they were concerned with substance over form: the abuse inherent in the \"*double pursuit of the same claim in respect of the same interest*\" is not deflected by the majority's simplistic insistence that contract claims and treaty claims are different:\n\nWhile the contractual agreements between Inter RAO, Telasi, Gardabani and Georgia, (and others), play an important role in the relationship between the Parties, the Claimants do not pursue claims for breach of contract in this arbitration. Rather, they claim breaches of various aspects of Article 3 of the BIT in relation to Georgia's conduct.19\n\nAward, \u00a7475.\n\n18.\n\nThis appeal to form over substance is brought into sharp relief if one considers the majority's reasoning in respect of its finding of liability under the BIT, which rests exclusively on a breach of the umbrella clause in Article 3(4). Despite the length of the ICSID Award, the majority's reasoning in applying its interpretation of the umbrella clause to the facts of the case is contained in a few sentences. In relation to the Claimant Silk Road:\n\nAs indicated above, in the SCC Arbitration the Tribunal determined the obligation to compensate that the Respondent was required to observe. Having failed to observe that obligation and compensate Silk Road, the Respondent has breached its obligation entered into in the 2013 Memorandum. Accordingly, the Respondent has failed to observe its obligation with respect to Silk Road's investment, Telasi.20\n\nAward, \u00a7701.\n\n19.\n\nAnd in relation to the Claimant Gardabani:\n\nIn the Partial Award on Liability and the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal determined that the Respondents, the Government, the MOE and the SSB, are required to compensate Gardabani and finally determined the extent of compensation due, in the amount of USD 27,499,000. As there is no indication that the Respondent has paid compensation to Gardabani to date, the Respondent must now compensate Gardabani in that amount pursuant to its obligation under Article 3(4) of the BIT.21\n\nAward, \u00a7705.\n\n20.\n\nThe brevity of this analysis is the natural consequence of the majority's strict liability approach to the umbrella clause: a breach of contract is *ipso facto* a breach of the treaty. I disagree with that approach and that is the subject of the second part of my dissent. But the idea that the law or justice requires the simultaneous pursuit of a contract claim and a treaty claim in respect of the same loss and two separate awards of compensatory damages for that loss is indefensible.\n\n21.\n\nThe second reason provided by the majority for rendering two awards of damages for the same loss is that \"*it was clear from the outset that the Claimants were pursuing remedies in the SCC and ICSID Arbitrations on the basis of largely the same facts and that the relief pursued would overlap*\" such that the Respondents \"*were content to proceed with coordinated, separate arbitrations and the issuance of separate awards in each case*\".22 The fact that these proceedings were consolidated and required the issuance of two separate awards does not in any way provide a justification for the majority's decision to render two awards of damages for the same loss. After the SCC Award made the Claimants whole, the Respondent was entitled to submit that the pursuit of further claims in relation to the same loss would be an abuse of process. There is obviously no contradiction between that position and the Respondent's original agreement to consolidate the two proceedings, even less some sort of implicit agreement with the proposition that the distinction between contract and treaty claims entails the award of double compensation for the same loss.\n\nAward, \u00a7479.\n\n22.\n\nAnd why does the prospect of the issuance of two awards rather than a single award make any difference? A tribunal constituted under an investment treaty can have jurisdiction over contract claims and treaty claims. Would a tribunal in its single award make an order of full compensation for the breach of contract claim, and then make a second order of the same amount of compensation for the breach of the umbrella clause, thereby doubling the damages for the single loss? There is no difference in substance between that approach and what the majority has done in this case.\n\n**C STRICT LIABILITY UNDER THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe so-called \"umbrella clause\" is contained in Article 3(4) of the BIT and reads: \"*Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.*\"\n\n24.\n\nThe majority has interpreted the umbrella clause in Article 3(4) of the BIT as supporting the following principles:\n\n24.1. A contractual obligation \"*entered into*\" by a Contracting Party with the foreign investment company that is a signatory to a contract is also an obligation towards any member of the corporate group of the signatory (i.e. the principle of privity of contract does not apply) such that any member of that corporate group has standing to invoke the umbrella clause in respect of that obligation;23\n\n24.2. A contractual counterclaim by the Contracting Party against the signatory is opposable against the member of the corporate group invoking the umbrella clause;24\n\n24.3. The umbrella clause is a strict liability regime: any breach of contract by the Contracting Party is automatically a breach of the umbrella clause;25\n\n24.4. \"*Any obligation*\" extends to obligations in legislation or regulations.26\n\nAward, \u00a7689.\n\nAward, \u00a7736.\n\nAward, \u00a7701 (in relation to Silk Road) and \u00a7705 (in relation to Gardabani).\n\nAward, \u00a7691.\n\n25.\n\nThe only authority cited by the majority in support of these propositions is the \"*plain meaning*\"27 of Article 3(4) itself. There is no analysis of the context or the object and purpose of the BIT or general rules of international law despite all these elements being an obligatory part of a single interpretative exercise under Article 31 VCLT.28\n\nAward, \u00a7\u00a7687-8.\n\nThe ILC made this point explicitly in its commentary on the draft articles that later became the VCLT:  \n\"The Commission, by heading the article 'General rule of interpretation' in the singular and by underlining the connection between paragraphs 1 and 2 and again between paragraph 3 and the two previous paragraphs, intended to indicate that the application of the means of interpretation in the article would be a single combined operation. All the various elements, as they were present in any given case, would be thrown into the crucible, and their interaction would give the legally relevant interpretation. Thus, Article [31] is entitled 'General *rule* of interpretation' in the singular, not 'General *rules*' in the plural, because the Commission desired to emphasize that the process of interpretation is a unity and that the provisions of the article form a single, closely integrated rule.\" [1966] *Yearbook of the ILC*, vol II, p 219, \u00a78.\n\n26.\n\nI disagree with all four of the majority's propositions in respect of the interpretation of the umbrella clause. I also do not fathom how these propositions can be said to be encrusted in the slender text of Article 3(4).\n\n27.\n\nI will first provide my own interpretation of Article 3(4) by reference to the elements in Article 31 VCLT and then consider the majority's propositions and the consequences that flow from them.\n\n**C1 The proper interpretation of the umbrella clause**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe treaty obligation in Article 3(4), like all the obligations in the BIT, is an obligation addressed to a Contracting Party as a sovereign\u2014a subject of international law that has the capacity to enter into treaty relations with another sovereign. From the perspective of international law, a State is a unitary entity and the internal separation between the different branches of power (legislative, executive and judicial) is largely irrelevant in respect of its engagements towards another State. When an organ of the State enters into a contract with a private party, however, it is not contracting on behalf of the State as a subject of international law. It is normally the government, or other manifestation of the executive branch, that enters into contracts with private parties, and it certainly does not bind the legislative or the judicial branches when it does so. This follows both from the distinction between the \"State\" as a subject of international law and the \"government\" as the internal division of the State that enters into contracts with private parties, as well as the fact that such contracts are governed by domestic law and not international law.29\n\nThe classic study of this distinction is by P Mayer, 'La neutralization du pouvoir normative de l'Etat dans le contrat d'Etat' (1986) 113 *Journal du droit international* 5.\n\n29.\n\nThis provides the essential context for Article 3(4). Article 3(4) is not addressed to the organs of the State that contract with private parties; it is addressed to the State as a subject of international law. It is not, in other words, directed to regulating the infinite number of contractual relationships entered into between executive organs of the State and private parties; it is rather directed to regulating the conduct of a State as a sovereign, just like every other obligation of protection in an investment treaty.\n\n30.\n\nThe State as a sovereign has plenary powers over persons and things within its territory and foreign investments are thus exposed to an abuse of those powers. The object and purpose of an investment treaty is to mitigate the sovereign risk associated with making investments in the territory of either Contracting Party to an acceptable degree and thereby encourage the inflow of foreign investment capital.\n\n31.\n\nThe State as a sovereign has the power to interfere in contractual relationships entered into between its executive organs and private parties and that power is regulated by Article 3(4). The State as a sovereign and subject of international law must not use its sovereign powers to undermine contracts that its organs have \"*entered into*\" with private parties. It must \"*observe*\" the obligations under these contracts. \"*Observe*\" is not the same thing as \"*perform*\". To \"*perform*\" a contractual obligation implies being a party to the contract in question. The State as a subject of international law and the Contracting Party to a treaty does not generally contract with any private party. The State as a subject of international law and unitary entity is also not \"*bound*\" in the contractual sense by obligations undertaken by state organs or other instrumentalities with private parties. That would be absurd: for instance, it would mean that the judicial branch would effectively be bound by obligations contracted by the executive branch despite that fact that the judiciary is often called to adjudicate disputes relating to those obligations.\n\n32.\n\nThe State as a sovereign and subject of international law must not use its sovereign powers to undermine contracts that its organs have \"*entered into*\" with private parties. And the State will be responsible for a failure to \"*observe*\" the obligations under these contracts whether that failure emanates from the executive, legislature or judiciary despite the fact that the legislative and judicial organs are not \"*bound*\" by contractual obligations entered into by an executive organ under the applicable domestic law. This makes perfect sense because the functional purpose of the umbrella clause is to protect the contractual bargain from extra-contractual (sovereign) interference. That interference can potentially come from any state organ exercising sovereign power whether or not it is bound by the contract in question. The State's duty on behalf of all its organs to \"*observe*\" contractual obligations undertaken towards foreign investments is apt to capture this.\n\n33.\n\nThe functional purpose of an umbrella clause can thus be succinctly stated. If a State uses its sovereign powers to interfere with a contractual bargain entered into between a state organ and a private party, then the State is stepping outside the contractual realm, to obtain an advantage that it could not secure within that realm. The equality of the parties to the contract is disrupted. International law needs to intervene.30\n\nSeveral tribunals have found that the umbrella clause, and investment protection obligations more generally, only relate to sovereign acts: *Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V. v Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9) Further Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 9 October 2012, \u00a7\u00a7240-1; *Consutel Group S.P.A. in liquidazione v People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (PCA Case No. 2017-33) Final Award, 3 February 2020, \u00a7321; *El Paso Energy International Company v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/15) Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, \u00a7\u00a777-85; *Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3) Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, \u00a7278; *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/11) Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, \u00a7\u00a772-82; *Muhammet \u00c7ap & Sehil In\u015faat Endustrive Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v. Turkmenistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/6) Award, 4 May 2021, \u00a7\u00a7709, 962. See also: T W\u00e4lde, 'The Umbrella Clause in Investment Arbitration\u2014a Comment on Original Intentions and Recent Cases' (2006) 6 *JWIT* 183.\n\n34.\n\nThus far I have focused on the text of the umbrella clause in Article 3(4), the context and the investment treaty's object and purpose. A further element of decisive importance by reference to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT is that this interpretation of the umbrella clause is harmonious with the general rules of international law. It upholds the principle of systemic integration31 and the idea conveyed by Verzijl that \"*[e]very international convention must be deemed tacitly to refer to general principles of international law for all questions which it does not itself resolve in express terms and in a different way.*\"32\n\nC McLachlin, 'The Principle of Systemic Integration and Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention' (2005) 54 *ICLQ* 279.\n\nVerzijl P, *Georges Pinson Case* (1927-8) AD No. 292.\n\n35.\n\nThe functional purpose that has been assigned to the umbrella clause is consistent with the orthodox position in general international law. In the words of Schwebel:\n\n[W]hile a mere breach by a State of a contract with an alien (whose proper law is not international law) is not a violation of international law, a 'non-commercial' act of a State contrary to such contract may be. That is to say, the breach of such a contract by a State in ordinary commercial intercourse is not, in the predominant view, a violation of international law, but the use of sovereign authority of a State, contrary to the expectations of the parties, to abrogate or violate a contract with an alien, is a violation of international law.33\n\nS Schwebel, *Justice in International Law* (1994) 431-2.\n\n36.\n\nFA Mann described the distinction between a State's contractual liability and its international responsibility for interference with contracts in the following illuminating terms:\n\nOne is thus confronted with the duality of the contracting State's capacities (and its firm appreciation is likely to assist in exposing the heart of the problem). The contracting State, as a fisc, is under contractual duties towards the alien to whom it is bound on the footing of private law; yet, in addition to or in place of that liability in private law, the contracting State, as a sovereign, may be under a delictual liability in international law towards the claimant State. The tort, if any, is of a very specific character: is it unlawful for a State to invoke its own legislative or executive measures, taken by it as a sovereign, to justify what *prima facie* constitutes a breach of its own contract made by it as a fisc?34\n\nFA Mann, 'State Contracts and State Responsibility' in *Studies in International Law* (1973) 303.\n\n37.\n\nThe inclusion of an umbrella clause in an investment treaty answers this question in the affirmative. It was a question that was far from controversial as the debate among the leading scholars before the rise of the modern investment treaty testifies. There was, therefore, ample justification to settle the matter by express language in an investment treaty.\n\n38.\n\nThe orthodox position thus reflects a fault-based ground for liability for interference in a contractual relationship with a foreign national: the State has abused its sovereign power to deprive the foreign national of a benefit or to impose an additional burden that was not envisaged under the terms of the contract or its applicable law. There is unlikely to be a remedy under the contract to redress this injustice, especially when the governing law of the contract is the law of the host State. The State can use its sovereign powers to modify that law and/or the contractual terms such that there will be no action available to the foreign national for any breach under the applicable law.35\n\nIbid 304, 313.\n\n39.\n\nThe identification of a ground of fault in the interpretation of the umbrella clause is important because general international law on the protection of aliens has always rested on fault and not strict liability36 and the other standard investment protection obligations in investment treaties have also generally been interpreted as encompassing fault-based liability as well.37 It would be surprising if the umbrella clause were to be a glaring exception against the background of general international law and the other obligations in the investment treaty itself. That, however, would be the consequence of adhering to the \"elevation theory\" of the umbrella clause and its insistence on strict liability.\n\nR Jennings & A Watts, *Oppenheim's International Law* (9th edn, 1996) 508-511.\n\nI recently examined the schism between the strict liability and fault-based notions of \"legitimate expectations\" as part of the FET standard in *Mathias Kruck et al v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No ARB/15/23) Partial Dissenting Opinion, 13 September 2022.\n\n40.\n\nThis fault-based interpretation of the umbrella clause does not only chime with general international law on the liability of States for the interference in contracts with foreign nationals. It is also harmonious with general international law on state immunity, which also provides relevant rules of international law for the purposes of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT when interpreting the umbrella clause. The law on state immunity also has a distinction between commercial acts (*jure gestionis*) and sovereign acts (*jure imperii*). That distinction is deployed to determine whether a dispute with a State is amenable to adjudication before a national court or instead should be resolved at the international level.38 If the dispute relates to a State's commercial acts, then it cannot invoke sovereign immunity before the courts of a foreign State with jurisdiction to adjudicate that dispute with a private party. If the dispute relates to a State's sovereign acts, then it can invoke sovereign immunity and the rationale is that such a dispute should be channelled to a form of international dispute resolution. Investment treaty arbitration is precisely that. A neat symmetry, therefore, arises between the circumstances in which a State is obliged to submit to adjudication before a foreign court (contractual disputes) and before an investment tribunal (sovereign acts relating a contract under the umbrella clause) by reference to the law of state immunity.\n\nH Fox, 'In Defence of State Immunity: Why the UN Convention on State Immunity is Important' (2006) 55 *ICLQ* 399, 405.\n\n41.\n\nThis recognition that the domestic and international legal orders have complimentary rather than conflicting roles to play in respect of disputes relating to state contracts with foreign nationals also resolves another perennial problem which is the significance of an exclusive jurisdiction clause or arbitration clause in those contracts. The majority in this case,39 and adherents to the \"elevation theory\" more generally, dismiss the relevance of such clauses by appealing to formalistic labelling: contract claims and treaty claims are different and these clauses are only concerned with the former. This does not, of course, explain why some contractual obligations are \"elevated\" but not others. More about that later. But pursuant to the majority's application of the umbrella clause, there is no substantive difference between the adjudication of a contract claim and a claim under the umbrella clause. As the previous extracts from the majority's reasoning in the ICSID Award reveal, the findings on the Claimants' claims for breach of contract were dispositive for their conclusion that there was also a breach of the umbrella clause. There is no independent analysis of additional elements pertaining to liability or quantum under the umbrella clause and no daylight between the claims. A breach of contract is *ipso facto* a breach of the umbrella clause.\n\nAward, \u00a7438.\n\n42.\n\nIf the function of an umbrella clause is to protect a foreign investment against sovereign abuse and that is the essence of an umbrella clause claim, then a contract claim and a treaty claim are different in substance and not just in form. An exclusive jurisdiction clause or arbitration clause in a state contract cannot apply *ratione materiae* to a claim that the State has abused its sovereign powers by acting outside the legal framework for the contractual relationship. It is no longer a dispute arising out of the contract and its governing law: the essence of the claim is precisely that the State has undermined the contractual bargain from outside the contractual realm. And the adjudication of such a claim is not preconditioned on the preliminary resolution of the full extent of any contractual dispute between the parties to the contract in accordance with its applicable law. As previously stated, international law needs to intervene in this context precisely because the aggrieved private contracting party is unlikely to have any contractual remedy if the State has used its sovereign powers to modify the applicable law or abrogate the contract.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n43.\n\nApplying this interpretation of the umbrella clause to the facts of this case, the Government of Georgia submitted to the contractual procedure for disputes arising under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA (the SCC Arbitration). In that arbitration, this Tribunal awarded Telasi and Gardabani full compensation on the basis that the Government had failed to indemnify them against the negative impact of changes to the tariff regime in breach of the express contractual obligations in those contracts in the amounts quantified by the Tribunal (which did not coincide with the positions taken by the Claimants or the Respondent). At no point has the Government sought to repudiate its contractual obligations or otherwise modify or abrogate the contracts by resorting to sovereign powers. This is a perfect example of a dispute that has never left the boundaries of a contractual dispute. There is no conduct on the part of Georgia that can be the object of a claim under the umbrella clause. Unless the function of an umbrella clause is to impose a supplementary punishment for a breach of contract upon a State, and there is no functional reason for international law to intervene in this dispute.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n44.\n\nAlthough it has become unfashionable to confront opposing arguments in investment treaty arbitration, I now propose to address the points made in the jurisprudence and the literature against the interpretation of the umbrella clause that I have defended here.\n\n45.\n\nThe **first** argument is that the rules of attribution in respect of the conduct of state organs apply to both commercial acts (*jure gestionis*) and sovereign acts (*jure imperii*) and hence it is impermissible to interpret the scope of the umbrella clause as extending to the latter but not the former. This logic is flawed. It amounts to arguing backwards from the content of the secondary rules of responsibility to fill in the content of the primary rules of responsibility (in this case the content of a substantive obligation of investment protection). The rules on attribution in the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility were drafted as the lowest common denominator of principles that would apply to the breach of any international obligation. Some primary obligations of international law are apt to extend to the commercial activities of States, others are not. The secondary rules had to cover all the possibilities that might arise from the diverse range of primary obligations in international law. There is no doubt that a breach of contract by a state organ is capable of being attributed to the State but that says nothing about the content of the relevant primary obligation. The commentary to the ILC's Articles makes this clear:\n\nIt is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as \"commercial\" or as \"*acta iure gestionis*\". Of course the breach by a State of a contract does not as such entail a breach of international law. Something further is required before international law becomes relevant, such as a denial of justice\u202640\n\nILC's Commentary to Article 4, \u00a76 in J Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility* (2002) 96.\n\n46.\n\nThe ILC's commentary gives several examples of debates about the inclusion of various elements in the secondary rules that were ultimately discarded for the reason that such elements could not be generalized across the entire spectrum of primary rules. The requirement of damage was one example; the role of fault was another. But the ILC was careful to emphasize that the exclusion of these elements from the secondary rules was without prejudice to their inclusion in primary rules.41\n\nCrawford's introduction to the ILC's Articles explains the position taken: \"It was sometimes suggested that the absence of any reference in Part One to damage, or to any form of fault (intention, lack of due diligence, etc.) implied that international law did not treat these as pre-requisites for responsibility. In the sense that it did not require these in every case this was true; but it might require them in some or many cases. By referring these issues to the interpretation and application of the primary rule, the Draft Articles took an essentially neutral position, neither requiring nor excluding these elements in any given case.\" J Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility* (2002) 13.\n\n47.\n\nThe **second** argument is that the distinction between commercial acts (*jure gestionis*) and sovereign acts (*jure imperii*) requires an analysis of the motives of a state organ in breaching a contract with all the problems that entails. This is false. Just like the law of state immunity from jurisdiction,42 what matters is the nature of the act alleged to violate the umbrella clause and not its purpose. The test is very straightforward: could the act in question have equally been adopted by the private party to the contract or does the act rest upon the exercise of sovereign power only available to a state organ?43\n\nH Fox & P Webb, *The Law of State Immunity* (2013, 3rd edn) 411.\n\nSee the detailed discussion and application of this test in: *Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V. v Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9) Further Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 9 October 2012, \u00a7\u00a7254-79.\n\n48.\n\nThe **third** argument is that the only way to give the umbrella clause an *effet utile* is to adopt the \"elevation theory\" because otherwise there would be too much overlap with the fair and equitable treatment obligation. This is more of a rhetorical device than an argument of legal principle. The truth is that there is much overlap between all the different obligations of investment protection. When, for instance, is an unlawful expropriation not also a breach of the FET standard? And yet it is extremely common in investment treaty practice to include both obligations. The umbrella clause reflects a basis for international responsibility in general international law just like the prohibition of unlawful expropriation and the other common investment protection obligations (including the FET standard for which the international minimum standard was at least the predecessor). There was thus a rationale for including it among the overlapping obligations in a typical investment treaty. The idea that the drafters of investment treaties must have intended to revolutionize the approach of international law to state contracts so that the umbrella clause would have an *effet utile* completely independent of the other investment protection obligations is quite absurd. It is certainly not supported by any available *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*. And one might expect that the revolutionary aims of the umbrella clause would have been spelt out in more than a single sentence of treaty text.\n\n**C2 The majority's interpretation of the umbrella clause: the \"elevation theory\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nI start by repeating Verzijl's statement that \"*[e]very international convention must be deemed tacitly to refer to general principles of international law for all questions which it does not itself resolve in express terms and in a different way.*\"44 This is the essence of the principle of systemic integration and Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. The burden is on those asserting that the umbrella clause encapsulates a fundamental departure from general principles of international law to make their case by reference to the interpretative elements set out in Article 31 VCLT (and the supplemental means envisaged in Article 32 if appropriate).\n\nVerzijl P, *Georges Pinson Case* (1927-8) AD No. 292.\n\n50.\n\nThere is not a single precedent in general international law for the proposition that a breach of contract is *ipso facto* a breach of international law.45 There has been debate among writers as to what additional element is required to attract the opprobrium of international law but there has never been serious dissent about the necessity of that additional element. This is the essential background to the interpretation of the umbrella clause and it would surely be reasonable to assume that if the drafters of investment treaties had intended to depart from the settled position in general international law then they would have expressed that intention clearly and unequivocally.\n\nIn an exhaustive account of the precedents and scholarly writings, FA Mann could cite only the pleadings of Switzerland and France as claimants in *Losinger & Co*, PCIJ (Series C) No 78 in support of this proposition (the Court ultimately did not render a judgment). FA Mann surmised: \"When one comes to judicial practice, it would appear that no international tribunal has ever expressed approval of the Swiss-French doctrine\u2026\" FA Mann, 'State Contracts and State Responsibility' in *Studies in International Law* (1973) 308-12.\n\n51.\n\nFar more importantly though, if the drafters had really intended to embark upon a radical departure from the position in general international law, they would have had to resolve the fundamental problems that arise from the elevation of contractual breaches to treaty breaches. These problems are reflected in some of the majority's four propositions, others do not arise in this case. For an interpretation of an umbrella clause to be coherent, however, it has to make sense if it is generalized for all cases. It must yield answers at least to the issues that have and will frequently arise in practice.\n\n52.\n\n**First**, I have already referred to the issue of how to give effect to dispute resolution clauses in contracts with state organs. In this case the problem was dodged because the contract claims were determined first in the SCC Arbitration by the same tribunal constituted to hear the treaty claims in the ICSID Arbitration in a consolidated procedure. But this is an extremely rare occurrence in practice; any interpretation of the umbrella clause has to work in all cases; and the problem generally arises when a claimant seeks to bypass an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract with a state organ by advancing an umbrella clause claim in investment treaty arbitration. What legal principle can be deployed to allow a claimant to enforce some obligations in the contract but ignore others? To approbate and reprobate in respect of the same contract? Unless a contract is applied holistically by a tribunal in accordance with its applicable law, the effect is to allow one party to rewrite the contractual bargain by securing the benefits and avoiding the burdens. Unless one adheres to the position that the claimant should have the right to pick and choose, the only other possibility is that the umbrella clause implicitly abrogates all dispute resolution clauses in contracts with state organs. That would be an extraordinary interpretation of the text of the umbrella clause and demonstrates the implausibility of the elevation theory.46\n\nSeveral tribunals have rejected a claimant's attempt to bypass the dispute resolution clause in a contract by labelling its claim as for breach of an investment treaty obligation: *Consutel Group S.P.A. in liquidazione v People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (PCA Case No. 2017-33) Final Award, 3 February 2020, \u00a7321 (\"The contract forms a whole, and the investor cannot, through an umbrella clause, invoke some of the clauses of the contract while exonerating others, such as the arbitration clause\"); *Kontinental Conseil Ing\u00e9nierie v. Gabonese Republic* (PCA Case No 2015-25) Final Award, 23 December 2016, \u00a7\u00a7180-3; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/6) Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004, \u00a7141; *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon* (ICSID Case No ARB/07/12) Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 September 2009, \u00a7202.\n\n53.\n\n**Second**, and continuing with the theme of having to apply the contract holistically, the majority in this case have sought to do just that by allowing the Government of Georgia to bring a counterclaim against the Claimants under the umbrella clause. This allows the majority to avoid driving a wedge between the findings on liability and quantum on the contract claims (and counterclaims) in the SCC Award and the conclusions on liability and quantum in respect of the umbrella clause in the ICSID Award. One is the mirror image of the other. That is in a sense laudable, but it is a result that cannot possibly be reconciled with the express terms of Article 3(4). The umbrella clause speaks only of obligations entered into by the State. It is expressed in unilateral terms like all other investment protection obligations because it is addressed solely to the State as a subject of international law. There is no textual basis in Article 3(4) for the proposition that a state organ's counterclaim for breach of contract in domestic law is opposable to the claimant who advances a claim under the umbrella clause in international law. One is forced into a result that is irreconcilable with the terms of Article 3(4) in their context because otherwise a claimant would be able to enjoy the benefits of the contract without the burdens. But this quandary is the direct result of the elevation theory.\n\n54.\n\nThe unilateral terms of the umbrella clause, by contrast, make perfect sense if the conduct sought to be regulated is the sovereign acts of the State. Only the State, and not the private contracting party, can abuse its sovereign power to interfere with the contractual bargain.\n\n55.\n\n**Third**, there is the problem of privity of contract. The majority has permitted Silk Road to enforce the rights of Telasi under the 2013 Memorandum on the basis that it has an equity interest in Telasi. More generally, the parties to an investment treaty arbitration in which an umbrella clause claim is being litigated are rarely the same as the parties to an investment contract with a state organ or instrumentality. On the side of the investor, the signatory party to the investment contract is often a locally incorporated company that is owned or controlled by a foreign investor with access to investment treaty arbitration. It is also often the case, especially for construction contracts, that there will be two or more parties representing different private interests: one or more joint venture parties signing on behalf of foreign investors, and another joint venture party signing on behalf of a local enterprise in circumstances where these parties have jointly tendered for the government works. On the side of the State, the signatory party might be a state organ but is also often an entity with separate legal personality and, in an event, the government as an executive organ is not the same as the State as a subject of international law.\n\n56.\n\nThe first difficulty arising from the idea that anyone with an equity interest in a signatory party to a state contract can enforce a benefit under it through the umbrella clause is that essential parties to what is in substance a contractual dispute will often be absent from the investment treaty arbitration. The rights of parties to the state contract who cannot be parties to the investment treaty arbitration are effectively eviscerated. It is a folly to assume that the contractual parties who have no standing in the investment treaty arbitration can always resort to the contractual forum to vindicate their rights. An order of full compensation on the basis of the elevation theory of the umbrella clause will effectively bring the contractual relationship to an end for those parties because the value of the state organ's contractual performance would have already been monetized and assigned to the party invoking the umbrella clause. Moreover, there will be no opportunity for those parties to present their positions on the interpretation of the contractual terms and their own entitlements under the state contract in the investment treaty arbitration (all of which might be relevant for the adjudication of the umbrella clause claim pursuant to the elevation theory). One of the reasons that parties to a contract include an exclusive jurisdiction clause or arbitration clause is to ensure that each and every party to the contract can vindicate its rights (both substantive and procedural) before a single forum.\n\n57.\n\nThe second difficulty is that allowing non-parties to enforce benefits under a state contract is to rewrite that contract. The question of who can and cannot enforce benefits under a contract is hardly something beyond the contemplation of the contracting parties and is expressly regulated by the contract and its applicable law.47 In jurisdictions that recognize exceptions to privity of contract for third party beneficiaries, the common position is that the stipulation of a benefit to a third party must be express and unequivocal in the contract itself.48 Merely having an equity interest in one of the signatory parties would obviously not suffice. Moreover, the *quid pro quo* for being allowed to enforce a benefit as a third party is often that any dispute resolution procedure in the contract be respected by that third party.49 The common theme here is that third parties cannot be permitted to undermine the sanctity of the contract.\n\nIn the words of the Ad Hoc Committee in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentina* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/08) Decision on the Application for Annulment, 25 September 2007, \u00a795: \"The effect of the umbrella cause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the parties to the obligation (i.e. the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella cause.\" The same conclusion was reached in: *Burlington Resources Inc. v Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No ARB/08/5) Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, \u00a7\u00a7214-7; *WNC Factoring Limited v The Czech Republic* (PCA Case No 2014-34) Award, 22 February 2017, \u00a7\u00a7321-3.\n\nThe French doctrine of *stipulation pour autrui* is one example; as is section 1 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (UK).\n\nFor instance, a third-party beneficiary would have to enforce any benefit against the parties to the contract though the arbitration clause in that contract pursuant to section 8 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (UK).\n\n58.\n\n**Fourth**, there is the problem of the applicable law. In this case, the majority has applied the elevation theory so that its conclusions in respect of liability and quantum under Georgian law in the SCC Arbitration are automatically replicated in international law under the umbrella clause in the ICSID Arbitration. The proposition that might be said to derive from this approach is that the contractual issues must be first adjudicated in accordance with their proper law and then those conclusions are elevated as findings on breach and quantum for the umbrella clause. But that is not how the elevation theory has been applied in most other cases. Tribunals have asserted that they do not need to resolve the contractual issues first in accordance with their applicable law, and in any event those issues can be characterized as factual questions in the eyes of international law and the umbrella clause.50 No explanation is ever provided as to how the disputed scope of a contractual term, for instance, can be resolved as a factual question in a void of the usual legal framework for interpretation. Ruling on issues of law by pretending they are issues of fact is likely again to result in rewriting the contract.\n\nThis following dictum is typical among tribunals taking this approach: \"The distinction between treaty claims and contract claims is well established, and it disposes of the Respondent's second admissibility objection.\u2026  \nIf, in order to assess whether there was a treaty breach, the Tribunal must first determine whether or not the relevant contractual obligations have been observed, then the Tribunal may hear evidence and make that determination. That some of the facts underlying the umbrella clause claim could also be the basis for a separate breach of contract claim\u2013in another forum, on another day\u2013is immaterial.\" *Georg Gavrilovi\u0107and Gavrilovi\u0107d.o.o. v Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No ARB/12/39) Award, 26 July 2018, \u00a7\u00a7420-421.\n\n59.\n\nOne is left with the notion that the approach to the applicable law of the contract by adherents of the elevation theory is strategic. If the claimant is seeking to leapfrog the contractually chosen forum to resolve disputes arising from the contract by bringing a claim under the umbrella clause, then the law governing the contract is necessarily irrelevant (it would not permit the claimant to bypass the exclusive jurisdiction clause or the arbitration clause and would insist on privity of contract) and contractual issues can be repackaged as issues of fact (to avoid the impression that the tribunal constituted under the investment treaty is usurping the role of the contractually chosen forum). If, however, the contractual forum has already decided the contractual issues (as is the case here), then those conclusions based on the law governing the contract can be adopted wholesale to condemn the State under the strict liability regime of the umbrella clause (as per the elevation theory).\n\n60.\n\nOne consequence of failing to apply the law governing the contract holistically is that the state organ may be deprived of a defence under that law for its non-performance of a contractual obligation despite the fact that the same defence would have been available to the private party if the shoe were on the other foot. How would a state organ, for instance, raise a defence based on force majeure or frustration or some other excuse for non-performance recognised by most systems of contract law if a tribunal applies the elevation theory to an umbrella clause?\n\n61.\n\nThe tribunal might say that: (i) the umbrella clause is a one-way street so a state organ cannot raise a contractual defence to the non-performance of an obligation; or (ii) it can raise that defence but not before the contractually-chosen forum as a legal question but as an issue of fact to be taken into account by the tribunal in its adjudication of the umbrella clause claim; or (iii) it can rely on the secondary rules on circumstances precluding wrongfulness (which include force majeure) as per the international law of state responsibility in place of any contractual defences; or (iv) the entire dispute under the contract should be adjudicated first in accordance with its proper law and then the tribunal's conclusion on non-performance of the state organ (if applicable) can be elevated to establish a breach of the umbrella clause. Each of these possibilities is deeply flawed:\n\n61.1. In respect of (i): Creating a mechanism whereby one party can enforce contractual benefits but escape any corresponding burdens or avoid defences available to the counterparty is obviously tantamount to rewriting the contract for the parties.\n\n61.2. In respect of (ii): To relabel a contractual defence as a question of fact is to deprive the party raising it of its legal rights under the law applicable to the contract.\n\n61.3. In respect of (iii): The rules on circumstances precluding wrongfulness in state responsibility are not applicable to a state organ's conduct as a contracting party. They apply only when a breach of an international legal obligation has been established. Contractual defences are defences to a breach of contract such that if they upheld then there is no breach. The functions of the doctrine of \"force majeure\" in state responsibility and in contract law are thus completely different, as are the legal tests for their application.\n\n61.4. In respect of (iv): Assuming the dispute resolution clause in the contract would not prevent an investment tribunal's adjudication of the contract dispute pursuant to its applicable law, this approach would not be possible unless the parties to the contract are the same parties to the investment treaty arbitration (otherwise it would result in rewriting the contract again). And like all these possibilities, it imposes strict liability in international law for a breach of contract.\n\n62.\n\n**Fifth**, the imposition of strict liability in international law by elevating a breach of a contractual obligation to a breach of the investment treaty violates basic notions of fairness and justice. The present case provides a good example. In the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal had to adjudicate highly complex and technical claims and counterclaims in respect of contractual provisions that were open to different interpretations by reasonable people. The Tribunal ultimately did not uphold the position advanced by either party and the Tribunal itself was split on one of the more difficult contractual issues. The Tribunal repeated on several occasions in the SCC Award and in the ICSID Award that both sides to the contractual dispute acted in good faith in presenting their alternative positions on the interpretation of the contacts in issue.\n\n63.\n\nDespite all this, one side to the contractual dispute is now being condemned as having violated international law for its breach of contract with all the consequences that might entail. So if a State, in good faith, contests the interpretation of a contract advanced by its private counterparty, and a tribunal concludes that the State's interpretation is wrong or at least partially wrong, then under the elevation theory it will be found to have violated the umbrella clause on the date of the breach of contract, despite submitting to a process of third-party adjudication to determine whether it has breached the contract at all. It follows that to avoid the risk of being condemned for a violation of international law, a State should accede to any plausible interpretation of a contract advanced by its private counterparty.\n\n64.\n\nThe general rationale for the imposition of strict liability is that the respondent should be liable if, in order to obtain a gain for itself, it has exposed the claimant to an especially high risk of loss. The classic example in national legal systems is when the respondent has engaged in hazardous industrial activities. There are very few examples of strict liability in international law but the same rationale applies. Article 7 of the Convention on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (1967) makes state parties strictly liable for damage caused by space objects launched from their territories to other state parties or their nationals. Needless to say that the functional justification for a strict liability regime in relation to damage caused by space objects is not easily transposed to a breach of contract situation.\n\n65.\n\n**Sixth**, the elevation theory of the umbrella clause is likely to result in increased costs in transacting with state parties and thus discourage foreign investment. The bottom line is that state parties can no longer rely on full force and effect being given to the terms of their contracts with foreign investors if the umbrella clause is applied in this way. The sanctity of the contract is diminished because one of the parties is permitted to avoid certain key provisions (the dispute resolution clause and the choice of applicable law) and non-parties are entitled to enforce part of the contractual bargain in another forum, often in the absence of one or more of the actual parties to the contract.51 The equality of the parties\u2014normally a fundamental assumption in contractual relationships\u2014is thereby abrogated in circumstances where the state party\u2019s conduct might just as well have been the conduct of the private party (i.e. because there has been no resort to sovereign powers).\n\n\"To hold the parties to their own choice of a legal system as the proper law of their contract and to judge the existence or non-existence of a 'breach' by the law so chosen is imperatively demanded by any legal order which cherishes certainty, equitable treatment, and sound results.\" FA Mann, 'State Contracts and State Responsibility' in *Studies in International Law* (1973) 315-6.\n\n66.\n\nThe result of this approach is the distortion of the legitimate expectations of both parties founded upon the rights and obligations memorialized in the contract and founded upon the law of contract that sustains those rights and obligations. That is not in the long-term interests of foreign investors, who above all else cherish stability and certainty in their relationships with governments and state enterprises. They are entitled to expect that their contracts will be performed in accordance with their proper law but not transformed by the parochial application of international law. State parties will have to look other arrangements such as performance bonds, guarantees, money in escrow and so on to preserve the sanctity of the contract and the principle of *pacta sunt servanda.* Those arrangements come at a cost and the effect is likely to be less foreign investment.\n\n67.\n\nI have not addressed the majority\u2019s additional proposition that *\"legislation or regulations are capable of creating obligations that are protected by an umbrella clause* ,52 As this does not appear to be relevant to their disposition of the case, which rests instead on the contractual obligations in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, I will not lengthen my dissent further in respect of this point.\n\nAward, \u00a7691."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n-------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Abbreviation** | **Definition** |\n| **2006 Energy Policy** | Resolution of Georgia's Parliament on the main directions of Georgia's energy sector policy;

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") under the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Georgia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which entered into force on 1 April 1999 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\"). This arbitration is referred to as the \"**ICSID Arbitration**\". This is one of two arbitrations whose procedure the Parties have agreed to coordinate.\n\n2.\n\nThe other arbitration concerns a dispute submitted under the Rules of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (\"**SCC**\"), pursuant to the terms of the arbitration agreements contained in the Memorandum on the Development of Cooperation in the Electric Sector and the Implementation of Previous Agreements between the Government of Georgia, Partnership Fund JSC (a Georgian state-owned entity), Inter RAO, Telasi, the Khrami Companies, and Mtkvari Energy LLC (owned by Inter RAO) (the \"**2013 Memorandum**\")1 and a share purchase agreement between the Government of Georgia, the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia, the State Service Bureau Ltd. and Gardabani Holdings B.V. (the \"**Khrami SPA**\").2 That arbitration is referred to as the \"SCC Arbitration\".\n\n2013 Memorandum, dated 31 March 2013, C-0034: Claimants' Translation / R-0028: Respondents' Translation, Clause 9, \"Arbitration Section\", which provides at Clause 9.3 that \"[a]ny dispute \u2026 shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce\".\n\nKhrami SPA, dated 12 April 2011, C-0016, Clause 8, \"Dispute Settlement\", which provides at Clause 8.4 that \"[a]ny dispute \u2026 shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce\u2026\".\n\n3.\n\nThese disputes between the Parties to the two arbitrations relate to the Claimants' investments in Georgia's electricity sector, which have been governed by successive agreements with Georgia since 1998 (to which the Claimants' parent company acceded in 2003). Specifically, these arbitrations concern regulatory measures that were adopted shortly after the Parties concluded their most recent agreement in 2013. The Claimants allege that Georgia, through its national electricity regulator, overrode the tariff-related provisions of the Parties' agreements by adjusting the tariffs applicable to the Claimants' investments pursuant to a new tariff-setting methodology, and that its interpretation of certain provisions of the agreements governing the Claimants' investments caused losses to the Claimants' electricity companies in Georgia. The Claimants allege that by way of an amended tariff scheme implemented after the key contractual agreements were concluded, the Respondent breached those agreements and substantially reduced the tariffs that were intended to attract and support investment in Georgia's electricity sector and upon which they relied in making their investments in Georgia. In this ICSID Arbitration, the Claimants allege that the Respondent's conduct breached various aspects of the fair and equitable treatment, impairment and umbrella clause provisions of the BIT and international law. In the SCC Arbitration, the Claimants argue that the Respondents' conduct breached the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants say they each have rights under the contracts and the Treaty because these instruments imposed on the Respondent an obligation to set and adjust tariffs in a particular way, or to compensate the Claimants for any failure to do so. According to the Claimants, the Treaty also required Georgia to ensure them a predictable, transparent and economically-rational regulatory regime for the operation of their local electricity companies. The Claimants say the Respondent violated these rights by reneging on express promises that formed the basis for the Claimants' investments in Georgia, and by acting unreasonably to undermine the viability of their investments.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the impugned actions breach the relevant Georgian law contracts, the Treaty or international law. They say that the tariff-setting mechanisms in the two contracts were not guaranteed to remain unchanged during their term because Georgia's electricity regulator, the NERC, is independent from the Government, and is solely responsible for setting tariffs. In any event, the Respondent says that the new tariff scheme did not breach any of the provisions of the 2013 Memorandum or the Khrami SPA. The Respondent says its conduct was in furtherance of Georgia's right to regulate and was reasonable and proportional. Further, the Respondent says that the Claimants' businesses are not struggling under arbitrary and unlawful regulation as alleged. Rather, they are thriving and receiving a generous profit.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent raises a counterclaim in each of the disputes,3 requesting that their rights under the 2013 Memorandum to a 50% share of a target investment allowance (\"**TIA**\") accumulated by the Claimants' Company, Telasi, JSC, between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015 be accounted for. The Respondent requests that the Claimants be ordered to pay 50% of the TIA to Georgia.\n\nThe Claimants note that the satisfaction of the counterclaim under the 2013 Memorandum in the SCC Arbitration would satisfy Georgia's counterclaim under the Georgia-Netherlands BIT under the ICSID Arbitration, and *vice versa*.\n\n7.\n\nThe contractual claims have been addressed in separate awards (the \"**SCC Awards**\"). The Treaty claims ware be addressed in this award.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties to the two arbitrations are described in this section.\n\n**A.

The SCC Proceedings**\n--------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 9 June 2017, the SCC received two coordinated requests for arbitration. The first was from Gardabani Holdings B.V. against Georgia, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia and State Service Bureau. The second was from Inter RAO UES, PJSC and Telasi, JSC against Georgia (together \"**SCC Request V2017/097**\").

In their answer, the Respondents appointed Professor Zachary Douglas, KC as their party-appointed arbitrator and confirmed the agreement between the Parties that Mr. Henri Alvarez, KC be appointed as chairperson of the Tribunal.\n\n24.\n\nOn 19 April 2018, the SCC referred case V2018/039 to the Tribunal.\n\n**B. The ICSID Proceedings**\n----------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn 4 August 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Gardabani Holdings B.V. and Silk Road Holdings B.V. against Georgia (the \"**ICSID Request**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration of the case styled *Gardabani Holdings B.V. and Silk Road Holdings B.V. v. Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/29). In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n27.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n28.\n\nThe co-arbitrators subsequently proposed, and the Parties agreed on 30 November 2017, to the selection of presiding arbitrator pursuant to a list procedure administered by the co-arbitrators with the assistance of the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal was composed of Mr. Henri C. Alvarez KC, a national of Canada, President, appointed by agreement of his co-arbitrators and pursuant to a list procedure; Professor Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n, a national of the Argentine Republic, appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Zachary Douglas KC, a national of Australia, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 December 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Alex B. Kaplan, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nBy the Parties' joint letters of 14 February 2018, the Parties informed ICSID and the SCC that they agreed to coordinate the two proceedings *Gardabani Holdings B.V. and Silk Road Holdings B.V. v. Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/29) and *Gardabani Holdings B.V. (Netherlands), PJSC Inter RAO (Russia) and Telasi (Georgia) v. Government of Georgia, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia, State Service Bureau Ltd* (SCC Case No. V2017/097). The Parties reached the following agreement on the coordination of the arbitrations:\n\n*(i) Whereas the two arbitrations will remain separate proceedings, the Parties wish for a single tribunal composed of Mr. Zachary Douglas QC (appointed by the Respondents), Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov (appointed by the Claimants) and Mr. Henri Alvarez (as chair) (the \"Tribunal\") to hear all claims, and hope that they, as well as the SCC and ICSID, will be amenable to this proposal;*\n\n*(ii) The two proceedings shall share a single evidentiary record, a single set of briefings, a single hearing, and a unified procedural timetable;*\n\n*(iii) Whenever reasonable to do so, and unless prohibited by or inconsistent with the applicable arbitration rules or law, the Tribunal shall issue single procedural orders, decisions or communications, indicating both proceedings in the cover page of any such procedural order, decision or communication;*\n\n*(iv) The Tribunal shall render two separate awards;*\n\n*(v) The Parties wish to express their gratitude to Professor Tercier and Professor Grigera Na\u00f3n for their service on their respective tribunals. The fees and costs of Professor Tercier and Professor Grigera Na\u00f3n will be borne equally by the Parties, subject to the Tribunal's final allocation of costs in the coordinated proceedings;*\n\n*(vi) As regards the appointment of Messrs. Douglas, Alexandrov and Alvarez, the Parties have reached their agreement on the assumption that, since the separation of the two proceedings is only formal, they would charge their fees and expenses as if this were a single proceeding, save as where necessary and reasonable, and that the two institutions will cooperate in implementing this arrangement.9*\n\nLetter of February 14, 2018, jointly signed by Mr. Noah Rubins KC of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and Mr. Charles Nairac of White & Case LLP (\"**Agreement on Coordination**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn 16 February 2018, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(1), ICSID informed the Parties of its receipt of Professor Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n's resignation in the ICSID proceeding. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 10(2), the ICSID proceeding was suspended until the vacancy resulting from Professor Grigera Na\u00f3n's resignation had been filled.\n\n33.\n\nOn 20 February 2018, ICSID notified the Parties that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 8(2), Mr. Alvarez and Professor Douglas had consented to Professor Grigera Na\u00f3n's resignation in the ICSID proceeding. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 11, the Claimants were invited to appoint an arbitrator to fill the vacancy.\n\n34.\n\nOn 26 February 2018, ICSID informed the ICSID Parties that Professor Stanimir Alexandrov had accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by the Claimants. On the same date, the ICSID proceeding resumed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 12.\n\n35.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1) and the Parties' having consented to defer the 60-day time limit by which the first session must be held, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 13 June 2018 by teleconference.\n\n36.\n\nOn 28 June 2018, the Claimants filed their Memorial (the \"**Claimants' Memorial**\") on the merits, accompanied by:\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Andrey Zavrazhnov (\"**Zavrazhnov I**\"));\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Anatoly Markov (\"**Markov I**\");\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Ilnar Mirsiyapov (\"**Mirsiyapov I**\");\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Sergey Kobtsev (\"**Kobtsev I**\");\n\n\u2022 Expert Report of Michael Peer of KPMG (\"**Peer I**\"), with Annexes MP-001 through MP-0641;\n\n\u2022 Expert Report of Manuel A. Abdala and Julian Delamer of Compass Lexecon (\"**Abdala & Delamer I**\"), with Annexes MAJD-01 through MAJD-14;\n\n\u2022 Exhibits C-0001 through C-0183; and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0112.\n\n37.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 9 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters in the coordinated proceedings. It provides that the applicable rules in the SCC Arbitration prior to the date of Procedural Order No. 1 were the SCC Arbitration Rules in force as of 1 January 2017. As of the date of Procedural Order No. 1, however, the SCC Arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, unless the outcome of the application of these rules would be prohibited by the SCC Arbitration rules or laws applicable to the SCC Arbitration. The ICSID Arbitration is conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006,\n\n38.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 also provides, *inter alia*, that the procedural language would be English, that the place of the ICSID Arbitration is Paris, France and that the place of the SCC Arbitration is Stockholm, Sweden.

On 20 December 2019, Mr. Peer submitted his fourth expert report in response on behalf of the Claimants (\"**Peer IV**\").\n\n61.\n\nThe Parties filed their submissions on costs on 16 January 2020 and replied thereto on 30 January 2020.\n\n62.\n\nOn 11 May 2020, the Claimants provided an update on the Telasi WAPT for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.\n\n63.\n\nOn 10 September 2020, the Tribunal requested an extension of the date for rendering the Award in the SCC proceeding pursuant to Article 43 of the SCC Arbitration Rules. The Parties were given an opportunity to comment on the Tribunal's request, but they did not comment, as confirmed by correspondence from the SCC dated 17 September 2020. Therefore, the SCC extended the deadline for the issuance of the Award in the SCC proceeding until 29 January 2021.\n\n64.\n\nBy letters of 14 January and 22 January 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties, via the SCC Secretariat, that it had made considerable progress in drafting the Awards in the coordinated cases. The Tribunal further indicated that, in order to determine the Parties' respective claims for damages, it would require further information and calculations from the Parties and their experts. The Tribunal therefore explained that it intended to first issue a Partial Award in the SCC proceeding together with directions for further quantum calculations. Then, once the calculations and information on quantum had been received, the Tribunal would issue a Final Award in the SCC proceeding and an Award in the ICSID proceeding simultaneously or shortly thereafter. In order to complete these steps, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to issue a Partial Award on Liability on or about 22 March 2021 and it requested an extension, until 30 June 2021, of the date for issuance of the Final Award in the SCC proceeding pursuant to Article 43 of the SCC Arbitration Rules.\n\n65.\n\nOn 25 January 2021, the SCC Secretariat extended the deadline for the issuance of the Final Award until 30 June 2021.\n\n66.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the SCC Tribunal informed the Parties that it would dispatch the Partial Award on Liability on 19 April 2021.\n\n67.\n\nOn 19 April 2021, the SCC Tribunal issued the Partial Award on Liability and Directions on Quantum to the Parties.

The Respondents also requested an extension of the 11 June 2021 deadline referred to above. On 4 June 2021, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondents' letter of 3 June 2021, opposing the extension. On 5 June 2021, the Respondents filed observations on the Claimants' 4 June 2021 correspondence Then, on 8 June 2021, the Claimants filed further observations, referencing their letter of 4 June 2021 as well as the Respondents' response of 5 June 2021.\n\n73.\n\nHaving considered the Respondents' request for an extension of the deadline for the submission of the experts' joint report and updated calculations, the Tribunal informed the Parties on 9 June 2021 that the 11 June 2021 deadline was maintained. Further, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would accept a brief reply from the Respondents to the Claimants' letter of 8 June 2021 by 15 June 2021; the Claimants would then have the opportunity to file a brief rejoinder by 21 June 2021.\n\n74.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that their experts would not be in a position to finalize their joint report and updated calculations by the 11 June 2021 deadline and that the Parties had agreed to request a one-week extension until 18 June 2021. On 11 June 2021, the Tribunal granted the requested extension.\n\n75.\n\nOn 11 June 2021, the Tribunal, having considered the Parties' observations on the Partial Award on Liability and the Claimants' letter of 3 June 2021, invited the Respondents to submit any comments they might wish to make in response to the Claimants' 3 June 2021 letter by 21 June 2021, and stated that the Claimants would be entitled to submit comments in response by 28 June 2021.\n\n76.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's directions of 9 June 2021, the Respondents submitted their reply to the Claimants' 8 June 2021 letter on 15 June 2021.\n\n77.\n\nOn 16 June 2021, the Respondents requested an extension of time to submit their comments in response to the Claimants' letter of 3 June 2021 until 23 June 2021. On 18 June 2021, the Tribunal granted the Respondents' extension request.\n\n78.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that their experts had made considerable progress but had not been able to complete the joint expert report by the 18 June 2021 deadline. The Parties requested an extension to file the joint expert report and the accompanying deliverables at 6:00pm CET on 21 June 2021. The Parties' request for such extension was subsequently granted by the Tribunal.\n\n79.\n\nOn 21 June 2021, the Parties submitted the Second Joint Expert Report (\"**JER 2**\") and the updated models of both experts and the deliverables. Each Party also submitted simultaneously its Comments on Quantum Issues as requested in the Tribunal's Directions on Quantum (\"**Claimants' Comments on Quantum Issues\"** and **\"Respondents' Comments on Quantum Issues**\").\n\n80.\n\nOn the same date, 21 June 2021, the Claimants provided their comments on the Respondents' letter of 15 June 2021 and earlier correspondence regarding the Respondents' request to re-model the damages calculation to reflect the ongoing \"unbundling\" of Telasi due to the Georgian energy reform legislation.\n\n81.\n\nOn 22 June 2021, the Claimants submitted their observations on the Respondents' Comments on Quantum Issues as filed on 21 June 2021. In response to the Claimants' observations, the Respondents submitted their comments on 23 June 2021.\n\n82.\n\nOn 23 June 2021, the Tribunal admitted the Respondents' Comments on Quantum Issues into the record and informed the Parties that the Claimants could file a response to sections II, VI and VII of the Respondents' Comments on Quantum Issues by 29 June 2021. The Claimants' response was received on 29 June 2021, and was accompanied by Legal Authorities CL-0230 through CL-0233.\n\n83.\n\nOn 29 June 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confirm whether or not the \"Unbundling Regime\" would apply to the Khrami Companies and, if it would apply, to provide a brief description of such effects by 5 July 2021.\n\n84.\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the Claimants submitted their response to the Respondents' comments of 23 June 2021.\n\n85.\n\nOn 5 July 2021, the Claimants submitted the executed Statement of Performance Indicators of Telasi for the year 2020 as Exhibit C-0256.\n\n86.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had conferred and were of the view that the legal unbundling which came into effect on 1 July 2021 does not apply to the Khrami Companies, whose tariffs remain regulated by NERC resolutions. By the same communication, the Claimants reserved their rights in respect of the possible adverse impact of the ongoing Georgian energy reform on the Khrami Companies.\n\n87.\n\nOn 9 July 2021 and pursuant to Article 43 of the SCC Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal requested from the SCC Secretariat an extension of time for the rending of the SCC Final Award. The request was shared with the Parties. No comments having been received from the Parties, the SCC granted the extension by letter of 23 July 2021.\n\n88.\n\nThe procedural history of these proceedings through 30 July 2021 is set out in the Partial Award on Liability and the First Partial Award on Damages.\n\n89.\n\nIn the First Partial Award on Damages, the Tribunal decided a number of issues relating to the calculation of damages, requested that the Parties' damages experts recalculate damages on the basis of those findings and produce a new joint expert report on damages, and deferred the Parties' claims for interest and costs to the Final Award.\n\n90.\n\nOn 4 August 2021, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties to provide the Tribunal's directions regarding the calculations of damages with respect to losses suffered by Telasi and the Khrami Companies for three relevant periods of time.\n\n91.\n\nOn 3 September 2021, pursuant to the Tribunal's directions, the Parties advised that they would provide the Tribunal with an updated joint expert report with revised calculations for the losses to Telasi to 1 July 2021 and the losses to the Khrami Companies by 25 October 2021. On 7 September 2021, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' proposed deadline for the submission of the new updated joint expert report (\"**JER 3**\").\n\n92.\n\nOn 10 September 2021 the Respondents wrote to the ICSID Secretariat to advise that the Parties jointly requested an extension of the deadline the Tribunal had set in its directions for providing an update on the implementation of the Unbundling Regime and its effects on Telasi's claims until 24 September 2021. This request was confirmed by the Claimants on the following day. On 12 September 2021, the Tribunal accepted the requested extension of the deadline.\n\n93.\n\nOn 24 September 2021, the Parties jointly requested a further extension of the deadline for the update on the implementation of the Unbundling Regime until 28 September 2021. On the same date, the Tribunal granted the Parties' request for an extension.\n\n94.\n\nOn 28 September 2021, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they would require additional time to provide an update on the implementation of the Unbundling Regime and to provide an updated calculation of losses to Telasi and Inter RAO for the period from 1 July 2021 through 31 December 2025. On 29 September 2021, the Tribunal confirmed its acceptance of the Parties' proposal to provide the calculation of damages of Telasi and Inter RAO, post-Unbundling, by 25 January 2022. The Tribunal also requested that the Parties provide, by 8 November 2021, an update on the implementation of the Unbundling Regime.\n\n95.\n\nOn 25 October 2021, the Respondents requested an extension for the submission of JER 3 until 27 October 2021.

On 3 November 2021, the SCC Secretariat granted the extension for the issuance of the Final Award.\n\n99.\n\nOn 2 November 2021, the Claimants requested that, in light of the deferral of the Tribunal's award relating to the assessment of damages for the period 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2025, the Tribunal allocate the legal costs incurred to the date of this Second Partial Award on Damages in this award.\n\n100.\n\nOn 8 November 2021, the Respondents opposed the Claimants' request on the basis that the Tribunal should take a decision on the costs of the arbitration only after it had decided all the disputed issues between the Parties in both the SCC and ICSID arbitrations. The Respondents also submitted that it would not be practical for the Tribunal to allocate costs before the outcome of the ICSID arbitration since the Parties had not segregated their costs between the two arbitration proceedings.\n\n101.\n\nOn 9 November 2021, the Parties submitted a joint update on the implementation of the Unbundling Regime, introduced on 1 July 2021, pursuant to which tariffs will be fixed for the period 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2025, together with Exhibits R-0110 through R-0114.\n\n102.\n\nOn 23 November 2021, the Tribunal issued the Second Partial Award on Damages in the SCC Arbitration.

It also determined damages owing to Telasi and Inter RAO for the Historical Period from 31 March 2013 to 31 December 2020 and for the Forecast Period from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021. The Tribunal also deferred the quantification of any damages owing on account of the losses suffered by Telasi and Inter RAO for the period 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2025.\n\n103.\n\nOn 17 January 2022, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal award additional damages to Gardabani on the basis that the assumption upon which the Experts had calculated compensation due to Gardabani tariffs from 1 January 2022 had changed (\"**Claim for Additional Damages**\"). The Claimants indicated that they were prepared to submit an explanation with supporting expert testimony in support of their request and suggested a timeframe for the filing of submissions from the Parties.\n\n104.\n\nOn 24 January 2022, the Parties jointly requested an extension until 14 March 2022 to submit the Joint Expert Report on Telasi's losses in the Forecast Period from 1 July 2021 through 31 December 2025.

On 4 February 2022, counsel for the Respondents advised the Tribunal that they were still seeking instructions with respect to the Claimants' Claim for Additional Damages and had no objection in principle to the Claimants' request for additional time to make their submission in support of their claim and were content with the period of one month from the date of the Claimants' submission to respond.\n\n107.\n\nOn 7 February 2022, the Tribunal granted the Claimants until 7 March 2022 to make their submission on their Claim for Additional Damages and granted the Respondents until 7 April 2022 to provide their response.\n\n108.\n\nOn 18 February 2022, the Tribunal requested an extension of the date for rendering the Final Award until 10 June 2022. On 24 February 2022, the SCC extended the date for the submission of the Final Award until 10 June 2022.\n\n109.\n\nOn 7 March 2022, the Claimants filed their Submission in Respect of Additional Gardabani Losses, together with the Fifth Expert Report of Michael Peer and supporting materials.\n\n110.\n\nOn 13 March 2022, the Parties jointly requested an extension until 22 March 2022 to submit the joint expert report on Telasi's losses during the Forecast Period (1 July 2022\u201331 December 2025).

On 22 March 2022, the Parties jointly requested an extension until 24 March 2022 to submit the joint expert report and the Tribunal granted the Parties' request on the same date.\n\n111.\n\nOn 24 March 2022, the Parties submitted the Fourth Joint Expert Report regarding the quantification of compensation owing to Telasi for the Forecast Period (\"**JER 4**\"). The Parties also subsequently submitted their respective experts' updated models and accompanying exhibits.\n\n112.\n\nOn 7 April 2022, the Respondents submitted their Response to the Claimants' Claim for Additional Damages. In their Response, the Respondents accepted that the tariffs in question had changed and suggested that the Parties' experts attempt to agree on the calculation of any additional damages by 15 May 2022. The Claimants accepted the Respondents' suggestion and the Tribunal set the deadline for the submission of a new joint expert report (\"**JER 5**\") on 16 May 2022.\n\n113.\n\nOn 5 May 2022, the Tribunal requested from the SCC a new extension of the date for rendering the Final Award until 9 September 2022. On 13 May 2022, the SCC granted the Tribunal's request and extended the deadline for rendering the Final Award until 9 September 2022.\n\n114.\n\nOn 16 and 19 May 2022, the Parties jointly requested an extension of the deadline for submitting JER 5 until 6 June 2022. On 20 May 2022, the Tribunal granted the Parties' joint request. Subsequently, the Parties jointly requested additional extensions, which the Tribunal granted.\n\n115.\n\nOn 9 June 2022, the Parties submitted JER 5 which set out the Experts' calculations relating to the Claimants' Claim for Additional Damages.\n\n116.\n\nOn 13 June 2022, the Tribunal requested that the Parties provide their submissions on interest and their updated claims for costs by 30 June 2022.\n\n117.\n\nOn 29 June 2022, the Parties jointly requested an extension of the deadline for submissions on interest and updated costs until 5 July 2022. On 30 June 2022, the Tribunal granted the extension requested.\n\n118.\n\nOn 30 June 2022, the Claimants requested leave to submit in evidence two recent articles relating to the setting of Gardabani's tariffs in November 2022.\n\n119.\n\nOn 5 July 2022, the Parties filed their respective submissions on interest and costs.\n\n120.\n\nOn 8 July 2022, the Respondents submitted their Response to the Claimants' Request to Submit New Articles into Evidence. In their response, the Respondents submitted that the press articles that the Claimants sought to submit into evidence are not relevant to the issue of whether the Khrami Companies' generation tariffs will be increased in November 2022. Nevertheless, the Respondents stated that although the request for admission of the articles in question came late in the proceedings, they had no principled objection to the introduction of the articles into the record.\n\n121.\n\nOn 14 July 2022, the Tribunal accepted the Claimants' request and admitted the articles into the record.\n\n122.\n\nOn 9 September 2022, the Tribunal issued the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration. In that award, the Tribunal determined the damages owing to Telasi for the period of 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2025 and awarded compensation to Gardabani and Telasi for breaches of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum. It also awarded the payment of interest and determined the costs of that arbitration.\n\n123.\n\nThe ICSID proceeding was closed on 27 September 2022.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL OVERVIEW**\n------------------------\n\n**A. Overview of Georgia's Electricity Sector**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nSince its independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and until 2003, the electricity sector in Georgia has transitioned from a Soviet era state-owned monopoly system to a liberalized system which sought to separate the different activities in the electricity supply chain (transmission, distribution, and generation). During this period, a new legal and regulatory framework was established for Georgia's electricity sector.10 Telasi provided electricity during this phase, but widespread shortages were common.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 13-21.\n\n125.\n\nGeorgia's early efforts in the late 1990s to modernize and liberalize its energy sector included privatizing its electricity system by selling a majority share in Telasi to an American company, AES (discussed under Section B below), transferring the management of other distribution companies to another American company, and bringing in other foreign companies to manage transmission as well as wholesale electricity market operators.11 Concurrently, Georgia also sought to strengthen its economic links with the European Union (\"**EU**\") and, in 1996, Georgia entered into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement aimed at fostering cooperation with the then European Community to transition Georgia into a market economy.12 While these efforts improved Georgia's power sector, by 2003 power cuts were still commonplace and further privatization was needed to rehabilitate State-owned electricity generation, transmission and distribution assets.13\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 19.\n\nPartnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and Georgia, 22 April 1996, entered into force 1 July 1999, R-0001, *see especially* Art. 43(1).\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\n126.\n\nGeorgia's 1999 Law on Electricity and Natural Gas (the \"**Law on Electricity**\") defined the legal framework for water, electricity and natural gas production and distribution in Georgia.14 The Law on Electricity allocated the ownership, commercial and regulatory functions in the power sector between the Ministry of Energy (the \"**MOE**\") and what would later become the Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission (the \"**NERC**\").\n\nLaw of Georgia No. 1934 on Electricity and National Gas, dated 30 April 1999 (\"**Law on Electricity**\"), CL-0073 / RL-0001.\n\n127.\n\nThe MOE develops national policy in the energy sector and promotes investments in that sector, but does not implement ownership, regulatory and operational-economic activities in the electricity sector.15\n\nId., Arts. 1(3)(a), 3(1), 3(2).\n\n128.\n\nThe Law on Electricity establishes general principles for setting tariffs that \"protect consumers from monopoly tariffs and promote long-term financial stability and development of the energy sector\", and calls for the adoption of secondary legislation to elaborate specifics.16 The law gives the NERC exclusive competence to adopt tariff-setting methodologies and set tariffs in accordance with those methodologies.17\n\n*Id.*, Arts. 1(3)(e), 43.\n\n*Id.*, Art. 4(5)(b).\n\n129.\n\nThe NERC is an independent body whose role, organization, powers and price-setting authority are governed by the Law on Independent Regulatory Authorities (\"**Law on INRAs**\") and its own Charter.18 The NERC is headed by a chairperson and four commissioners who adopt decisions and resolutions by majority vote regarding the issuing and revoking of licenses, developing and adopting tariff methodologies, setting and regulating tariffs, and settling disputes between market participants.19 Its decisions, which must include written reasons and be published, are regulated by the General Administrative Code of Georgia (\"**GACG**\"), and are subject to judicial review.20\n\nLaw on INRAs, RL-0004, Arts. 4(3), 17; NERC's Resolution No. 6, 6 March 2014, R-0003, Arts. 1(2), 1(3) (The NERC's functional independence is affirmed in its Charter). Financial independence, *see* Law on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Arts. 19, 20: the NERC sets its own budget based on fees it sets itself and collected from the regulated entities, must submit an annual report to Georgia's President and Parliament, and must be audited.\n\nLaw on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Arts. 4(5), 5(3), 6(1).\n\nGeneral Administrative Code of Georgia (\"**GACG**\"), RL-0005, Arts. 53, 103, 121, 177 (judicial review; *see also*, Law on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Art. 15; Law on INRAs, RL-0004, Arts. 4(6), 18).\n\n130.\n\nIn respect of the NERC's competence to adopt and apply tariff-setting methodologies, Article 11(1) of the Law on Electricity was amended in July 2010 to provide that:\n\n*NERC shall follow the basic directions of national policy in the energy, security, economy, environmental protection and other areas and the normative acts issued on the basis of these directions. [NERC] may also take into account the transactions entered into by the State in the energy and water supply sectors, and other relevant legal acts.*21\n\nLaw on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Art. 11(1).\n\n131.\n\nThe NERC is one of two independent regulatory authorities operating in Georgia.22 The Law on INRAs establishes the NERC's \"independence \u2026 from political pressure of any kind, from improper influence and illegal interference of State Authorities or other persons, as well as from any acts as may infringe on their independence\".23 \"Independence\" is defined as:\n\n*the ability of both an independent regulatory Authority and the Commissioner, without improper influence and illegal interference to exercise the authority of a regulatory Authority as determined under the applicable law, including discussing, investigating and deciding the matters assigned to its authority; any interference in the activities of an independent regulatory Authority, control of the said activities and demanding accounts of such activities on the part of any State Authority shall be inadmissible, if this is not explicitly provided for by the applicable law.*24\n\nArticle 6, \"Independence\", provides as follows:\n\n*1. Independent regulatory Authority and Commissioner shall be independent within the scope of their activities and shall comply only with the Georgian Legislation. Only an independent regulatory Authority shall have the right to exercise the full authority in respect to the matters which are delegated to it under the applicable law.*\n\n*2. Dual, concurrent regulatory authority shall be inadmissible.*\n\n*3. Any attempt of any person to exercise the jurisdiction over the sphere of authority of an Independent Regulatory Authority shall be illegal, and the results thereof shall be of no legal force.*\n\n*...*\n\n*5. It shall be inadmissible for an Independent Regulatory Authority to conclude any agreement which imposes certain obligations on Georgia, except for the cases as provided for in the Georgian Legislation.*25\n\nLaw on INRAs, RL-0004, Art. 2(b). The other independent regulatory authority in Georgia is the National Communications Commission.\n\nLaw on INRAs, RL-0004, Art. 1(2).\n\nLaw on INRAs, RL-0004, Art. 3(d).\n\nLaw on INRAs, RL-0004, Art. 6.\n\n132.\n\nIn addition to overseeing the tariffs that distribution companies can charge, controlling the issuance of generation and distribution licenses, and setting the fees for connecting new users to the distribution network, the NERC also produces an annual energy plan of how much energy each distribution company will acquire from each generator on a month-to-month basis over the course of a year (the \"**NERC's Annual Energy Plan**\"). The plan is based on the \"**Annual Electricity Balance**\" prepared by the Georgian State Electrosystem (\"**GSE**\") before the start of each year, and approved by the MOE. It includes a general forecast of the output of each generating plant, an estimate of electricity imports and exports, and a forecast of total electricity sales by each distribution company.26\n\nLaw on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Art. 23.1.\n\n**1. Organization of Georgia's Electricity Sector**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe basic elements of Georgia's electricity supply chain consist of:27\n\n\u2022 generation of electricity by power plants\n\no there are over 80 State-owned and privately-owned generation companies; 80% of which are hydropower plants (\"**HPPs**\"), 20% are thermal power plants (\"**TPPs**\")28\n\n\u2022 transmission of electricity into the distribution network\n\n\u2022 distribution of electricity to final consumers\n\no until 2017, there were three distributors: Telasi, which supplied Tbilisi; Kakheti Energy Distribution (\"**Kakheti**\"), which supplied the eastern region of Kakheti; and Energo-Pro Georgia (\"**Energo-Pro**\"), which supplied electricity to the rest of Georgia\n\no in 2017, Energo-Pro acquired Kakheti\n\no today, Telasi has a 35% market share and Energo-Pro holds the remaining 65%\n\n\u2022 sale of electricity to final consumers\n\no sales are vertically integrated with distribution, meaning that the same operators distribute and supply electricity to end consumers, with the exception of some large consumers who may buy electricity directly from power generators\n\n\u2022 trade of electricity produced by generators and imported from other countries on the wholesale market\n\no operated by the Electricity System Commercial Operator (\"**ESCO**\"), which is also known as the Commercial Operator of Power System (\"**COPS**\"). ESCO/COPS balances the electricity on the market by trading the volume of electricity delivered into the network by generators and importers which is not purchased under direct agreements with distributors.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28; Moselle I, Figure 1 at p. 29.\n\nMost HPPs depend on the amount of water flowing through rivers, which is at its lowest in winter when electricity consumption is at its highest, which in turn leads to electricity shortages that are serviced by TPPs and imports from neighboring countries, primarily Russia. During spring and summer, Georgia exports its surplus electricity to Turkey (Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 23).\n\n134.\n\nIn the electricity sector, transmission and distribution are natural monopolies and are typically regulated to avoid the risk of them charging excess prices to the detriment of consumers, whereas generation activities are competitive.29\n\nMoselle I, \u00b6\u00b6 3.22, 3.24, 3.30; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 28.\n\n135.\n\nUntil 1 July 2021, Telasi was both a distributor and a supplier of electricity. Effective as of that date, Telasi's electricity supply activities were taken over by a new Inter RAO subsidiary, TelMiko LLC, as required by the Electricity Market Model Concept which unbundled the distribution activities of vertically integrated electricity companies operating in Georgia (R-0110, the Unbundling Regime). Telasi continues to operate its distribution network.\n\n136.\n\nESCO/COPS is the State-owned company responsible for operating Georgia's electricity market. It also purchases and sells left over electricity that has not been directly contracted for, at tariffs which depend on the amount of electricity it buys and sells, and on market conditions.30 The price at which ESCO/COPS sells its electricity is usually higher than that of generation companies such as the Khrami Companies.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 17(c).\n\n137.\n\nGeorgia owns the two largest HPPs, Enguri HPP LLC (\"**Enguri**\") and Vardnili HPP Cascade (\"**Vardnili**\"), which produce the cheapest electricity in Georgia. They are required to supply electricity to the occupied territories in Abkhazia.31 Enguri alone produces 31% of the total generation capacity in Georgia. In comparison, the Khrami Companies produce 4% of Georgia's32 generation capacity.\n\nLaw on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Art. 49.\n\nMoselle I, \u00b6 4.11.\n\n138.\n\nThe GSE is the transmission system operator (\"**TSO**\") responsible for ensuring the functioning of the electricity system. The GSE prepares the Annual Electricity Balance which forecasts the supply and demand of electricity in a given year for the MOE's approval. The GSE also assists ESCO/COPS in balancing the electricity on the market.33 Energy supply agreements between generators (sellers) and distributors (buyers) must be registered with the GSE.34\n\nMoselle I, \u00b6\u00b6 4.23-24.\n\nMoselle I, \u00b6 4.40.\n\n**2. Georgia's Tariff System**\n------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe NERC regulates the rates that can be charged by each company for the sale of the energy it generates, known as the \"**Generation Tariffs**\". Generation Tariffs are intended to cover the generation and operating costs and capital expenditures of the company, plus a profit component.\n\n140.\n\nFor distribution companies, the NERC regulates the following three types of interrelated tariffs:\n\n141.\n\nThe \"**Consumer Tariffs**\" are the rates that a distribution company can charge to its customers and which form the revenue component of a distribution company's business.35 A distributor's Consumer Tariffs effectively comprise the sum of the WAPT and the Distribution Tariff, both discussed next.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 18(b)(i).\n\n142.\n\nThe Weighted Average Purchase Tariff (\"**WAPT**\") is a distribution company's weighted average annual cost per kilo watt hour (\"**kWh**\") of purchasing energy from generation companies. It constitutes the primary purchase cost component of a distribution company's business and is a function of the sources from which a distribution company purchases energy. The allocation of energy purchases from different generators to a distributor is referred to as the \"**purchase portfolio**\". Since the cost of energy differs from generator to generator (i.e., depending on whether they are HPPs or TPPs), each distributor's purchase portfolio will include a combination of more and less expensive sources of energy for the year. The NERC's Annual Energy Plan for each distribution company identifies, for each month, the generation companies from which a particular distribution company must purchase electricity, and in what volumes. The Claimants say that the NERC effectively controls the WAPT of each distribution company.36\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 18(b)(ii).\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the \"**Distribution Tariff**\" (or \"**Distribution Margin**\") is the difference between the amount the distributor pays to acquire electricity it is going to distribute and the amount it can charge its customers, which results in the profit.37 It is computed for different voltage levels as the distributor's forecast per unit cost, calculated on a regulated basis. The NERC's methodology in force at any given point provides guidelines as to how to compute each component of the total costs (including capital and operational expenses, normative losses and corrections adjusted for time value of money) and expected distributed amounts of electricity for each group of consumers. The Distribution Tariffs represent a distribution company's margin on a tetri per kWh basis, as opposed to the rates charged to customers.38\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 16.\n\n1 tetri is equal to 0.01 GEL (Abdala & Delamer I, fn 16). \"tetri\" is a fractional currency used only in Georgia since 1995.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants' economic experts summarize the relationship between the different tariffs as follows:39\n\nAbdala & Delamer I, p. 10, Figure I; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 19.\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondents' damages expert summarizes the building blocks of the Consumer Tariff as follows:40\n\nMoselle I, p. 55, Figure 19; Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission, Resolution No. 14 on Approving Electricity Tariff Calculation Methodologies, dated 30 July 2014 (\"**2014 Methodology**\"), CL-0084, Art. 16.\n\n146.\n\nWhen the NERC sets a particular tariff, the market participant might be charged more or less than that amount, and it can be temporarily adjusted upon the occurrence of a previously agreed trigger.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants say that because the NERC can set tariffs and control the actual WAPT, it controls the financial viability of energy generation and distribution companies in Georgia.41\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\n148.\n\nDistribution companies' (and generation companies') purchase portfolios are set as follows:42\n\n\u2022 Before the start of each year, the GSE prepares, and the MOE approves, the Annual Electricity Balance (described above at paragraph). Based on the Annual Electricity Balance, the NERC prepares its Annual Energy Plan. In practice, the NERC's Annual Energy Plan forms the basis of the GSE's daily and hourly planning and is used to match supply and demand on a real-time basis. It also informs the GSE's decisions to approve energy supply agreements between generation companies.43 The Claimants say the NERC's Annual Energy Plan informs the decisions of distribution companies and the ESCO/COPS regarding the allocation of energy from suppliers to distributors.44\n\n\u2022 Based on the NERC's Annual Energy Plan, the NERC calculates tariffs for each distributor predicting an annual WAPT and Distribution Tariff. A company's WAPT, as planned by the NERC, is intended to reflect the annual average costs expected to be incurred when purchasing energy. Each distribution company has a different WAPT, since its purchase portfolio contains a unique mix of energy from various generators at different tariffs.45\n\n\u2022 Next, a distribution company (i.e., Telasi) concludes electricity supply agreements directly with generators. Agreements are concluded on the basis of the NERC's Annual Energy Plan and informal discussions with the ESCO/COPS as to the volume of energy it can receive from a particular generation company.46\n\n\u2022 The agreements come into effect only upon registration by the GSE.47\n\n\u2022 In the event that not all of a distribution company's electricity needs are met by its direct agreements with generation companies, the distribution company will acquire those additional volumes from the ESCO/COPS at a higher tariff.48\n\n\u2022 Finally, the actual delivery of energy to a distribution company is determined on a monthly basis by the ESCO/COPS. The ESCO/COPS determines how much energy was received by a distribution company in a given month from each generator with whom the company has a supply agreement. Any portion of a distribution company's monthly supply of energy that has not been supplied under direct contracts with generators is deemed to have been acquired from the ESCO/COPS at its tariff.49\n\n\u2022 The Claimants say that when a distribution company receives energy, it cannot know from which generation companies it will be deemed to have received power for the purposes of monthly accounts. The ESCO/COPS informs each distributor after the fact which generators actually supplied energy to it in the previous month, in what volume and at what tariff. Monthly \"acts of acceptance\" signed between distributors and generators (and, to the extent applicable, the ESCO/COPS) confirm electricity volumes supplied.50\n\n\u2022 The volume of energy actually provided by various generators (as allocated by the ESCO/COPS) may differ from the projected volume that formed the basis for calculating a company's WAPT. This occurs for a number of reasons, such as the reallocation of inexpensive energy to other distribution companies and/or for export, unplanned increases of generation tariffs, and technical breakdowns in energy supply.51 Consequently, a distribution company's actual WAPT may exceed its planned WAPT, reducing its Distribution Tariff (or Distribution Margin).\n\nThe Claimants say that the manner in which a generation company's electricity output is assigned to distribution companies as part of the NERC's Annual Energy Plan, and implemented through supply contracts executed through the ESCO/COPS, determines its revenue (Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 23).\n\nLaw on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, Arts. 23.2, 35(3)(a), 35(3)(c).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(a).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(b).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(c).\n\nElectricity (Capacity) Market Rules, CL-0070, Arts. 9(2)(d), 16(1)(h); Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(d).\n\nElectricity (Capacity) Market Rules, CL-0070, Art. 14.3; Abdala & Delamer I, \u00b6 12; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(e).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(f): Claimants say this is consistent with the ESCO/COPS's role as the balancing and clearing entity for the energy market. If a distributor needs more electricity than has been planned for in its purchase portfolio (such as if a generator under-performs or because new consumers connect to its network), in practice it can only acquire additional electricity from the ESCO/COPS, or directly from a generator if the contract is registered with the GSE.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(g).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 22(h).\n\n**B. The Telasi SPA: AES's Initial Acquisition of Telasi and Management Rights to the Khrami Companies**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nTelasi was established in 1995 as a Georgian joint stock company. Telasi is now the second-largest distribution company of the three operators in Georgia, and covers Tbilisi and the surrounding urban areas. From 1995 to 1998, it was State-owned. In December 1998, the Government began privatizing distribution companies and power plants. The sale of Telasi in 1998 to an American corporation marked the first major privatization in the Georgian electricity sector. Pursuant to a share purchase agreement, AES Silk Road Holdings B.V. (\"**AES**\") acquired 75% of the shares of Telasi (the \"**Telasi SPA**\").52\n\nShare Sale and Purchase Agreement between Georgia and AES Silk Road Holdings, dated 21 December 1998 (\"**Telasi SPA**\"), C-0001; NERC Resolution No. 3 \"On Approval of the Rules and Procedures for Establishing a Methodology for Electricity Tariffs\", 1 July 1998, RL-0007.\n\n150.\n\nOn the same date, the NERC issued a resolution regarding the approval of methodology, rules and procedures of setting electricity tariffs (\"**1998 Methodology**\").53\n\nNERC Resolution No. 3 \"On Approval of Methodology, Rules and Procedures of Setting Electricity Tariffs\", dated 1 July 1998, RL-0007, \"invalidated by resolution N 8 of [NERC] 06/08/2011\".\n\n151.\n\nIn 1999, AES also acquired the management rights for the Khrami Companies for 25 years.54 In 2003, AES changed its name to Silk Road Holdings B.V., after being acquired by the Inter RAO group.\n\nManagement Agreement between Georgia and AES Georgia Holdings B.V. (another Dutch subsidiary of AES Corporation), 22 December 1999 (\"**Khrami Management Agreement**\"), C-0002.\n\n152.\n\nBy 2003, AES had rehabilitated Telasi from its former state, but had not improved the condition of Khrami Companies. The Respondents explain that when AES first took over the management of the Khrami Companies in 1999, Khrami-2 required extensive repair in order to operate at full capacity. To support the rehabilitation of Khrami-2, Georgia transferred its Japanese bank loans of JPY 2 billion and GEL 3 billion to AES on the condition that AES would repay them by 2025 (by the end of the 25-year Khrami Management Agreement).55\n\n*See* Khrami Management Agreement, C-0002 / R-0006, Clause 3.3.\n\n**C. Inter RAO's 2003 Acquisition of Telasi and Management Rights for the Khrami Companies**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nPursuant to a sale and purchase agreement in 2003, Inter RAO acquired 100% of AES's Georgian Operations, which included:\n\n\u2022 AES's 75% indirect interest in Telasi;56\n\n\u2022 the shares of AES Georgia, which held management rights for the Khrami Companies for 25 years under the Khrami Management Agreement; and\n\n\u2022 the shares of AES Gardabani, which wholly owned AES Mktvari (a Georgian TTP).\n\nSale and Purchase Agreement between AES and RAO Nordic (a Finnish company wholly owned by Inter RAO), dated 11 July 2003, C-0003.\n\n154.\n\nAt the time that Inter RAO acquired AES's existing operations in 2003, electricity consumption tariffs were significantly higher than those in Russia. Representatives of Inter RAO stated that they assumed they would be able to substantially reduce these tariffs.57\n\nNews article, dated 1 September 2003, R-0005; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 43.\n\n155.\n\nIn January 2004 (six-months after Inter RAO acquired Telasi and management rights to the Khrami Companies), a new government was elected in Georgia. It made year-round electricity supply a priority. In this regard, the new Government concluded an Agreement with Inter RAO that provided that the Government would use funds from the state budget to repay bad debts of Telasi's consumers and a commercial loan that Telasi had taken out in 2003. In return, Inter RAO undertook to repay Telasi's debts to the state budget and to ensure the import of additional electricity from Russia.58 The Government also entered into an Agreement with Telasi and Mtkvari-Energy LLC to improve the operation of the Georgian power system and provide a safe power supply to the city of Tbilisi, pursuant to which Telasi would receive a monthly credit to purchase electricity from domestic sources, including the Khrami Companies, and Telasi would sign contracts for the purchase of electricity and ensure the importation of electricity from Russia and Armenia as required to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the City of Tbilisi.59 The Government also entered into a Memorandum with JSC Khrami-2 (\"**Khrami-2**\"), and others to support the rehabilitation of two turbines owned by Khrami-2 by way of loans at preferred rates.60\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 49; 2004-2005 Memorandum of Understanding on Uninterrupted Electricity Supply, R-0007.\n\nAgreement between Georgia, JSC Telasi and LLC Mtkvari-Energy, dated 23 September 2005, R-0008.\n\nMemorandum between Georgia, LEPL \"Energogeneracia\" and JSC \"Khrami HPP-2\" on Rehabilitation of Hydro Power Plant Khrami-2, dated 17 January 2005, R-0004.\n\n156.\n\nIt appears that the Government planned to improve the reliability of the supply of electricity and, for the first time, the supply of electricity was uninterrupted during the winter of 2005-2006.61\n\nKhetaguri I, \u00b6 13.\n\n157.\n\nAt the time that Inter RAO acquired AES's existing operations in 2003, the Telasi SPA and Khrami Management Agreement, which continued to govern the relationship between the Parties, had not been modified since their conclusion in 1998 and 1999, respectively.62 Under the Khrami Management Agreement, Inter RAO was obliged to rehabilitate the Khrami Companies in exchange for a right to receive all dividends and a management fee.63\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 28; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 44.\n\nKhrami Management Agreement, C-0002 / R-0006, \u00b6 3.5.\n\n158.\n\nAfter Inter RAO's acquisition of Telasi in 2003, the tariff related arrangements between the Government and Telasi were modified several times by the Memoranda concluded in 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 and, finally, 2013 (these are discussed, in turn, below). Each time that a new agreement was concluded, it was immediately implemented by the NERC. Each agreement effectively reset the Parties' relationship with new or different tariff regimes.\n\n159.\n\nThe Telasi SPA established long-term tariff rules for calculating and adjusting the tariffs applicable to Telasi's sale of electricity over two time periods: 1 April 1999 to 30 September 2008; and 1 October 2008 onwards.64 The 1998 Telasi SPA became the model for the later agreements. It set Distribution Tariffs, agreed in advance, which provided for a fixed margin. This was separate from and unrelated to the \"**Cost-Plus**\" basis covering costs and a reasonable rate of return, provided for in the 1998 tariff methodology (the \"**1998 Methodology**\").65\n\nTelasi SPA, C-0001, Schedule 11.\n\n1998 Methodology, dated 1 July 1998, RL-0007; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 19-20. However, according to the Claimants, the Telasi SPA did not permit the application of the 1998 Methodology after 2008: Tr. Day 7 (Claimants' Closing Statement), 6-7: \"The Telasi SPA didn't allow the [1998] methodology to come into play even after the first ten years, and the Telasi SPA had no end date\".\n\n160.\n\nThe Telasi SPA allocated three main risks between the parties: (i) changes in currency; (ii) changes in inflation; and (iii) changes in the WAPT. The first period featured fixed Distribution Tariffs which were to be adjusted to take into account inflation, currency fluctuations and increases to the costs of purchasing energy. For the second period, the Telasi SPA did not specify a Distribution Tariff. Instead, the tariff was to be calculated in accordance with Georgian Law which would appear to include the tariff methodology in force at the relevant time, as follows:\n\n*[C]alculated as frequently as every five years and thereafter, will be calculated in co-operation with the NERC and in accordance to Good Utility Practice, and set in accordance with Georgian Law and the following principles:*\n\n*i) The costs which AES and the NERC reasonably anticipates will be incurred by AES and/or the Company in the five-year period to which the new Tariff relates with reference to international practices in regulated utility companies, including but not limited to:*\n\n\u2022 *Operation maintenance and repair costs;*\n\n\u2022 *Personnel costs;*\n\n\u2022 *Insurance and reinsurance costs;*\n\n\u2022 *Depreciation and financial costs (including interest and repayment of investments in supporting, maintaining and developing all Equipment, buildings, installations and the Assets);*\n\n\u2022 *Working capital costs;*\n\n\u2022 *Losses, including all commercial and technical losses;*\n\n\u2022 *Taxes;*\n\n\u2022 *Effects of Force Majeure Events;*\n\n\u2022 *Effects of Developments;*\n\n\u2022 *Costs in relation to any management, support, technical support agreements;*\n\n\u2022 *Any outside investment service fees.*\n\n*ii) A reasonable rate of return will be allowed so as to provide the Company and their Affiliates with a fair and reasonable market-related return on its initial and subsequent investments in the Company; and*\n\n*iii) The large capital expenditure that will be required to upgrade the Company to a world class Energy distribution enterprise; and*\n\n*iv) The need to hold the Company harmless for changes in Exchange Rates and inflation by making periodic adjustments to the Customer Tariff; and*\n\n*v) Any other matters which the State and AES agree should be taken into account.*66\n\nTelasi SPA, C-0001, Schedule 11, \u00b6 3.6. The 1998 Methodology did not expressly exclude Telasi from its application. The 1998 Telasi SPA also contained a Change of Law provision (Clause 20) which provided for compensation of AES for increases in taxes, additional material capital expenditures in order to comply with any change of law, or otherwise materially increase the annual cost of performing the obligations on AES or Telasi or materially decrease the annual returns (other than as the result of the decrease in demand for energy or energy services). Should a Change of Law occur, AES was required to cause Telasi to submit to both Georgia and the NERC a certificate detailing the relevant Change of Law. It also provided that for a period of 10 years from the date of the Telasi SPA, Georgia could submit to the NERC a certificate detailing relevant changes of law and/or decreased costs or increased returns of Telasi which were expected to be borne by the Company and requesting adjustments to Telasi's consumer tariff. In the event the Parties were unable to agree to a tariff adjustment by way of good faith negotiations, either Party could refer the matter to arbitration. Finally, Clause 20.7 provided that Georgia would only be obligated to indemnify AES or Telasi for any change of law in the event the change was discriminatory in the sense that its principal effect was an AES or Telasi or directly borne by them and such action materially adversely affected them (Clause 7.5.7).\n\n161.\n\nBy about 2006, as the end of the first period approached, it became apparent that new arrangements were necessary for Telasi because the Telasi SPA did not prescribe specific tariffs for the second period commencing 1 October 2008 and tariffs would then be set in cooperation with the NERC in accordance with Georgian Law and the various principles set out in the Telasi SPA.67 Further, a number of disagreements had arisen between the parties regarding the adjustment of tariffs and certain taxation matters.68 These issues were resolved by way of an agreement between the Government and Inter RAO in 2007, the 2007 Memorandum, discussed below under Section E.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 31; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 31 and fn 49: \"See for example the preamble and Clause 1.6 of the Memorandum between the Government of Georgia and Inter RAO, 20 June 2007, C-0005 [/ R-0015]\".\n\n**D. The NERC's 2006 Adjustment of Telasi's Tariffs**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nIn late 2005, the NERC undertook a comprehensive review of electricity tariffs and, on 31 January 2006, it established an electricity working group tasked with formulating a new tariff system in the long-term, and for February-April 2006 in the short term.\n\n163.\n\nIn April 2006, Telasi applied to the NERC for a 12 tetri/kWh upward adjustment of its Distribution Tariffs in accordance with the Telasi SPA to recover losses incurred between 1999 and 2005 in excess of the investment program provided for in the Telasi SPA.69\n\nTelasi Tariff Application, 11 April 2006, R-0010, Annex 1.\n\n164.\n\nIn May 2006, the NERC held a public hearing to discuss the results of its tariff system revision and Telasi's application.70 The NERC noted the \"necessity of adjusting the entire tariff system\" due to: (i) increased Russian gas prices, which resulted in a 35% rise in the average cost of gas-fired TPP generated electricity in Georgia; (ii) an \"increase of the expensive power share in the [electricity] balance\" caused by 24-hour electricity supply; and (iii) an increase in the cost of electricity produced by the six HPPs that had submitted tariff applications due to \"wage growths\", \"revaluation of fixed assets\" and \"raised prices on materials\".71 The NERC stated that these changes had resulted in a 61% increase in the WAPT paid by distribution companies to generation companies.72 The Deputy Minister of Energy at the time, Mr. Khetaguri, endorsed the NERC's proposed increase in the WAPT.73\n\nNERC Hearing No. 13 Minutes, dated 11 May 2006, R-0011, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid*.; Explanatory Note to Energy Commission Draft Resolution on Electricity Tariffs, R-0013, p. 1.\n\nNERC Hearing No. 13 Minutes, dated 11 May 2006, R-0011, p. 2.\n\n*Id.*, p. 4; Khetaguri I, \u00b6 15; *see* Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 56.\n\n165.\n\nLater in May 2006, the NERC issued Resolution No. 18 (the \"**2006 Tariff Resolution**\"), wherein it granted to Telasi a 2 tetri/kWh increase (of the 12 tetri/kWh tariff increase requested in Telasi's tariff adjustment application), which raised its Distribution Tariff to 7.89 tetri/kWh, effective 1 June 2006.74 The NERC found that it was necessary to increase Telasi's Distribution Tariff to allow Telasi to recover GEL 22 million in losses in 2005-2006 due to a VAT change, investments in Telasi's power grid between 2002 and 2005 and USD 20 million in other investments to be made by Telasi between 2006 and 2008, and to account for the temporary reduction of Telasi's Distribution Tariff imposed by the NERC in 2003.75 The Claimants say that the NERC's decision to only increase Telasi's Distribution Tariff by 2 tetri/kWh left Inter RAO with claims as of the end of 2006 that it assessed at USD 134 million.76\n\nNERC Resolution No. 18, dated 15 May 2006, R-0014, Art. 7.\n\nExplanatory Note to Energy Commission Draft Resolution on Electricity Tariffs, R-0013, pp. 1-2; NERC Hearing No. 13 Minutes, 11 May 2006, R-0011, p. 3; Khetaguri I, \u00b6 16.\n\nTr. Day 7 (Claimants' Closing Statement), 8:20-23. *See* Inter RAO internal note, dated 16 August 2006, C-0184.\n\n166.\n\nIn June 2006, Georgia's Parliament issued a resolution on Georgia's energy policy. Amongst the various policy directions adopted was the attraction of investment and development of competition through privatization in the sector. The Energy Policy provided for different types of tariffs to protect consumers from monopolistic prices and permit long-term sustainable growth, including the setting of various tariffs, including long-term pre-fixed tariffs (the \"**2006 Energy Policy**\").77\n\nResolution of the Parliament of Georgia No. 3259-I, \"On the Main Directions of Georgia's Energy Sector State Policy\", dated 9 June 2006 (\"**2006 Energy Policy**\"), RL-0006.\n\n167.\n\nShortly thereafter, Telasi asked the MOE to agree to a new tariff policy for Telasi because, as explained above, as of 1 October 2008, the Telasi SPA contemplated that Telasi's tariffs would be determined in accordance with Georgian Law and the principles set out in its Schedule 11.78\n\nKhetaguri I, \u00b6 18.\n\n168.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Energy, Mr. Khetaguri, testified that Inter RAO and the MOE negotiated a new tariff policy for Telasi over several months. According to him, the parties were able to reach an agreement because: (i) Georgia wanted to incentivize additional investments in its energy sector; (ii) Georgia was seeking investors to construct new HPPs to achieve a cheaper supply of energy that was not dependent on the price of imported gas; and (iii) Inter RAO had proven to be a good business partner through prior agreements with respect to Telasi and the Khrami Companies' operations, and was interested in helping the government achieve its energy policy.79\n\nSee *Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n**E. The 2007 Memorandum**\n--------------------------\n\n169.\n\nIn June 2007, Georgia and Inter RAO entered into the Memorandum on the Development of Cooperation in the Electric Power Sector and Implementation of Previous Agreements (the \"**2007 Memorandum**\").80 The 2007 Memorandum provided for, *inter alia*:\n\n\u2022 long-term Distribution Tariffs for Telasi at higher than Cost-Plus rates until 1 September 2015 (namely, 7.89 tetri/kWh, which was the level set by the NERC in the 2006 Tariff Resolution)81 so as to allow Telasi to recover costs previously incurred by 30 September 2008 (Clause 1.1);82\n\n\u2022 a weighted average tariff for the purchase of electricity (the \"**WAPT**\") and the adjustment of Telasi's consumer tariff if the WAPT increased or decreased by more than 10% than the WAPT at 1 September 2007 (Clause 1.3);83\n\n\u2022 the adjustment of Telasi's distribution tariff as follows:\n\n*1.4 To make an adjustment of distribution tariff of Telasi JSC.*\n\n*Adjustment of the distribution tariff (margin) of Telasi JSC, with respect to inflation and change in the lari to US dollar exchange rate, shall be carried out three times (on September 1, 2010, September 1, 2012, and September 1, 2015).*\n\n*The adjustment will be made only by the amount of the change exceeding 10% for any of the factors listed below. In this case:*\n\n*1) Adjustment of the tariff (margin) for distribution by Telasi JSC, taking into account inflation, will be carried out only if the average annual inflation rate for the periods (from September 1, 2007 to September 1, 2010; from September 1, 2010 to September 1, 2012; and from September 1, 2012 to September 1, 2015) is more than 10%.*\n\n*2) Adjustment of the tariff (margin) of distribution by Telasi JSC, taking into account change in the lari exchange rate against the US dollar, will be implemented only if the change in the lari exchange rate against the US dollar, at the time of the adjustment, exceeds 10% since the last revision period. Adjustment for this factor will apply only to 10% of the tariff (margin) of distribution by Telasi JSC.*\n\n*1.5 Measures to ensure tariff policy until 2015.*\n\n*The Government of Georgia, within its competence, will provide all-round assistance so that the long-term tariff schemes and the conditions for their adjustment specified in clauses 1.1 to 1.4 are approved by the GNERC resolutions no later than September 1, 2007.*\n\n*1.6 Controversial issues of adjusting the distribution tariff (margin) of Telasi JSC.*\n\n*Since the criteria set in clause 1.5 is met, Telasi JSC will not demand GNERC to increase or to adjust the tariff (margin) of distribution by Telasi JSC and/or will not use other compensation mechanisms for any of the controversial issues that arose before the signing of this Memorandum, including: change in the VAT taxation regime, reduction in the tariff due to the write-off of the debt to the PPR, the emergence of losses as a result of delays in setting tariffs, a reduction in the tariff due to the resolutions of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, indebtedness to SILK ROAD HOLDINGS B.V. and indebtedness specified in clause 5 hereof.84*\n\n\u2022 The establishment of an investment program to be implemented by Telasi:\n\n*2 Investment program*\n\n*The parties agree that, under the terms of the introduction of the long-term tariff system defined in clause 1 hereof, Telasi JSC shall implement investment projects aimed at further facilitation of the technical condition of the electric network of Telasi JSC, contributing to the reliability and quality of power supply to consumers in Tbilisi. The investment program shall adhere to the following parameters during the period from January 1, 2007 until December 31, 2015:*\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Years* | *Investment commitments (in million US dollars)* |\n| *2007* | *24.0* |\n| *2008* | *13.9* |\n| *2009* | *2.5* |\n| *2010* | *2.5* |\n| *2011* | *2.5* |\n| *2012* | *2.5* |\n| *2013* | *2.6* |\n| *2014* | *2.9* |\n| *2015* | *2.9* |\n| *Total* | *56.3* |\n\n*Telasi JSC shall submit a report on the investments made to the relevant structures, including GNERC, not later than 6 months after the end of the calendar year. In case of failure to meet or complete entirely the announced investment volumes, the GNERC shall have the right to make appropriate tariff adjustments for Telasi JSC* (Clause 2);85\n\n\u2022 The construction of a new HPP on terms to be agreed between the Parties:\n\n*7 Construction of a new HPP*\n\n*7.1 The parties agreed that before March 1, 2008, they will ensure selection and approval of the basic technical and economic parameters of a new hydroelectric power station or hydroelectric power plants within the territory of Georgia with an approximate total capacity of 100 MW. CJSC \"INTER RAO UES\" will provide financing for construction and launch of the above hydroelectric power station or hydroelectric power stations before 1 September 2015. At the same time, Telasi JSC shall ensure a 100% purchase of electricity produced within 7 years from the moment of launching this station and, in case the purchase of this electricity leads to an increase in the tariff for the purchase of electricity, fixed in clause 1.3 hereof, and will not demand from GNERC a corresponding increase in the then existing consumer tariff.*\n\n*7.2 If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the selection and approval of the abovementioned basic technical and economic parameters, and a hydroelectric power station or hydroelectric power stations are not put into operation before September 1, 2015, Telasi JSC shall from September 1, 2015 and during the next 7 years, purchase at its own account at least 15% of its total annual electricity purchases from hydroelectric power plants and/or renewable energy power stations, put into operation after signing this Memorandum. At the same time, if the purchase of this electricity leads to an increase in the average tariff for the purchase of electricity recorded in clause 1.3 hereof, Telasi JSC will not demand GNERC to increase the consumer tariff existing at that time* (Clause 7).86\n\n2007 Memorandum between Georgia and Inter RAO, dated 20 June 2007, C-0005 / R-0015; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 33-35; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 33; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 17; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 63-71.\n\n2007 Memorandum, C-0005 / R-0015, Clause 1.\n\nExplained in Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 65.\n\n2007 Memorandum, C-0005 / R-0015, Clause 1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id.*, Clause 2.\n\n*Id.*, Clause 7.\n\n170.\n\nAs will be discussed below, the Respondents say that fixing Telasi's Distribution Tariffs at the higher rate of 7.89 tetri/kWh for seven years (2007-2015), as opposed to setting them as of 1 October 2008 as provided for in the Telasi SPA, allowed Telasi to earn a significant margin on its Distribution Tariffs by way of a supplement on the base tariff. This margin, which the Respondents refer to as Telasi's alleged \"**super profit**\", was to be used to fund Telasi's future investment obligations in Georgia, including the construction of an HPP.87 The Claimants say that the tariffs set under the 2007 Memorandum were intended to account for the waiver of Telasi's claims, the profitability of Telasi's operations and future investment obligations. They say there was no understanding that the margin provided for in Telasi's tariffs was a \"super profit\".\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 66; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 34(a); Khetaguri I, \u00b6 22. At the hearing, the Respondents conceded that the 2007 Memorandum (and 2011 Memorandum) was drafted in a way that makes it difficult to identify and quantify how much money had been accumulated. Tr. Day 7 (Respondents' Closing Statement), 175-176.\n\n171.\n\nInitially, Mr. Khetaguri suggested that the NERC's decision to hold the 7.89 tetri/kWh Distribution Tariff for Telasi steady until 2015 in the 2007 Memorandum was exclusively in exchange for an obligation to build an HPP, pursuant to Clause 7 of the Memorandum. However, under cross-examination, Mr. Khetaguri acknowledged that Telasi's increased Distribution Tariff for 2007-2015 was compensation for the unresolved issues left at the end of 2006, which amounted to approximately USD 134 million taking into account that the NERC had increased Telasi's Distribution Tariff by 2 tetri/kWh in May 2006.88\n\nTr.

The Respondents say that the thrust of their super-profit argument is that the supplement added to the base tariffs in the 2007 Memorandum, and subsequently in the 2011 Memorandum, was intended to finance Inter RAO's HPP construction obligation. In support, they refer to internal Inter RAO documents which state that it accumulated USD 193 million for that purpose, USD 80 million of which was coming from Telasi's consumers.89\n\nTr.

The 2010 Memorandum**\n--------------------------\n\n182.\n\nIn late 2009, the Parties began negotiating a new memorandum (the 2011 Memorandum, described below) after Inter RAO first expressed its interest in purchasing the Khrami Companies.102 The Parties were aware that the 2007 Memorandum would expire in September 2015 and unless they negotiated a new agreement, Inter RAO perceived a risk that the NERC might re-institute Telasi's Distribution Tariffs on a lower Cost-Plus basis, pursuant to its current tariff-setting methodology.103 During the negotiations, Inter RAO proposed to restructure its share capital to settle some of Telasi's historical debts (dating back to when it was owned by AES) and Georgia wanted to record the Parties' agreement on a planned IPO for Telasi. To that end, in October 2010, the MOE and Inter RAO signed a two-year non-binding memorandum of understanding (the \"**2010 Memorandum**\").104 The 2010 Memorandum recorded the need to improve Telasi's economic efficiency of operation and the intention to undertake joint measures for its financial rehabilitation. In this regard, the 2010 Memorandum recorded the Parties' intention to examine various options of debt restructuring, financial rehabilitation and the increase of value of Telasi, including by consideration of the increase of Telasi's authorized capital by issuing additional ordinary shares to be owned by Georgia and Inter ROA's subsidiary, Silk Road.105 The 2010 Memorandum also stated that Inter RAO and/or its affiliates in Georgia would carry out the construction of an HPP of a capacity of at least 70 MW in accordance with terms which were to be agreed between the Parties.106\n\nKhetaguri I, \u00b6 31; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 78.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 40.\n\nMemorandum of Intentions between the Government of Georgia, JSC INTER RAO UES, Telasi Joint-stock Company and Mtkvari Energy Limited Liability Company, dated 1 October 2010 (\"**2010 Memorandum**\"), C-0006 (Claimants' Translation) / R-0018 (Respondents' Translation).\n\n*Ibid*., Clause 1.\n\n*Ibid.*, Clauses 2-3.\n\n183.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2010 Memorandum, the Parties continued to negotiate a new memorandum to govern Inter RAO's operations in Georgia, and a Sale and Purchase Agreement for the Khrami Companies (the \"**Khrami SPA**\").\n\n**H. The 2011 Memorandum**\n--------------------------\n\n184.\n\nOn 31 March 2011 (five months after the conclusion of the 2010 Memorandum), the Government of Georgia, Inter RAO, Georgian Electrosystem LLC and Energotrans LLC concluded the 2011 Memorandum.107 The Memorandum addressed both Telasi and the Khrami Companies.\n\nMemorandum on the Development of Cooperation in the Electric Power Sector and the Implementation of Previous Agreements between the Government of Georgia, JSC \"INTER RAO UES\", Georgian Electrosystem LLC and Energotrans, dated 31 March 2011 (\"**2011 Memorandum**\"), C-0015 (Claimants' Translation) / R-0019 (Respondents' Translation); Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 18; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 78-94.\n\n185.\n\nThe 2011 Memorandum covered the period from 31 March 2011 to 31 December 2025. It addressed, *inter alia,* the 2011-2025 investment program of Telasi, Inter RAO's investment to purchase the Khrami Companies, the construction of an HPP, and long-term electricity distribution tariffs of Telasi and the Khrami Companies' generation tariff and their adjustment.\n\n**1. Telasi's Tariffs**\n-----------------------\n\n186.\n\nWith respect to Telasi's investment program, the 2011 Memorandum extended the coverage of the program and increased the amount that Inter RAO was obliged to invest in Telasi's distribution grid from USD 56.3 million under the 2007 Memorandum to GEL 376.4 million (approximately USD 221 million) by the end of 2025:108\n\n*1. 2011-2025 Investment Program*\n\n*1.1 Investment Program of Telasi JSC*\n\n*1.1.1 To enhance the reliability of energy supply in Tbilisi and its suburbs and the service quality, to apply modern energy efficient methods and technologies, the Investor intends to procure that Telasi JSC makes and implements investment program and repair works on Telasi JSC electric power grids in the amount of 376.4 mln lari (VAT exclusive) from January 01, 2011, to December 31, 2025. The description and composition of investments and the equipment necessary therefore shall correspond to the Contract for Sale and Purchase of 75% (seventy-five percent) of Telasi JSC equity signed between the Government of Georgia, represented by the Ministry of State Property Management of Georgia, and AES Silk Road Holdings B.

If this objective was not met or did not result in anticipated profits, the Claimants say Telasi was to be compensated with a substantial increase in its Distribution Tariff.111\n\n*Id.*, Clause 2.1.2; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 49.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondents say the location and cost of building the HPP Chain had been determined by a Tbilisi design firm, Stucky Caucasus, which concluded that the most feasible option was to build it along the Khrami river.112 The relevant provisions of the 2011 Memorandum provide as follows:\n\n*1.3. HPP Construction*\n\n*1.3.1 In pursuance of and for the purpose of Clause 7.1 of the Memorandum of June 20, 2007 signed between the Investor and the Government of Georgia (hereinafter the \"Memorandum of 2007\"), having completed the preliminary feasibility studies for prospective HPP construction sites in Georgia, the Parties decided to start the construction of the HPP Chain with aggregate capacity of 90-100 MW to be commissioned by the end of 2015. In this case:*\n\n*\u0430) The Government of Georgia will procure land plots for the HPP Chain construction at a price not exceeding the standard cost to the Investor or a company authorized by the Investor.*\n\n*b) The Government of Georgia will . procure and ensure the provision . provide to the Investor or a company authorized by the Investor with of any and all approvals and licenses necessary to construct and commission the HPP Chain within 4 months after the respective applications accompanied by the documents are filed to the competent authorities as per the applicable laws of Georgia.*\n\n*c) The cost of acquisition and operation of land plots, of approvals, licenses, and other authorization documents and procedures necessary for the construction of the HPP Chain is included in the estimated construction costs of the HPP Chain (193 mln US dollars).*\n\n*1.3.2 The Parties have agreed that if no HPP from the HPP Chain as per Clause 1.3.1 is commissioned within the specified period, Telasi JSC, starting from January 01, 2016 and until any HPP from the HPP Chain is commissioned, shall buy not less than 15% of its total annual electric power purchase amount, as divided by months, from HPPs and/or electric power plants operating on renewable sources of energy, commissioned after the date of this Memorandum. If the purchase of such electric power leads to increase of Weighted Average Purchase Tariff as per Clause 2.2.1 hereof, Telasi JSC will not require from GNEWRC the corresponding increase of then effective Consumer Tariff.*\n\n*1.3.3 The Parties have agreed that not more than 75% but not less than 300 mln kWh per year of electric power produced by the HPP Chain as per Clause 1.3.1 of this Memorandum shall be exported by a company authorized by the Investor. The remaining portion of the electric power shall be purchased by Telasi JSC.*113\n\nPreliminary feasibility study, Stucky Caucasus, dated 28 January 2011, C-0009, p. 10.\n\n2011 Memorandum, C-0015 / R-0019, Clauses 1.3.1 -1.3.3.\n\n190.\n\nThe 2011 Memorandum also recorded that the Parties had agreed that a company of the Inter RAO group would purchase 100% of the two Khrami Companies for the price of USD 104 million pursuant to the Khrami SPA to be agreed between the Parties. The Memorandum also recorded the Parties' agreement that in order to ensure the return on investment for the purchase of the Khrami Companies, tariffs chargeable by those Companies would be increased commencing in 2014.114\n\n*Id.*, Clause 1.2.3 which also provided that Telasi would not, when purchasing electricity from the Khrami Companies, require from the NERC a corresponding increase of the then effective Consumer Tariff.\n\n191.\n\nThe 2011 Memorandum fixed Telasi's Distribution Tariffs at 7.89 tetri/kWh until the end of 2025.115 Telasi's Distribution Tariffs could be increased by a maximum of 0.84 tetri/kWh, calculated on the basis of the export price of electricity that would be generated by the new HPP Chain, with the aim of ensuring \"the return and payback of [Inter RAO's] investment\" in Telasi.116 The relevant provisions provide as follows:\n\n*2.1 Long-term electricity Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC*\n\n*2.1.1 The Parties agree that the establishment of long-term electricity tariffs can be equally beneficial for both Telasi JSC and electricity consumers of all categories, including the general population. Having the long-term electricity tariffs, Telasi JSC may, with the maximum accuracy and efficiency, plan the investment projects and its business in general, and consumers may be able to plan their household budget for the payment of the electrical power.*\n\n*2.1.2 The maximum increase of the electric power Distribution Tariff will be not more than 0.84 tetri per 1 kWh (VAT exclusive) and depends on the level of electric power sale price for export of the border through Akhaltsikhe-Borchkha power transmission line of 400 kV as per the table below. If the electric power sale price for export, without the transportation tariff, is less than 6.0 US cents per 1 kWh or more than 7.5 US cents per 1 kWh and if the Operator 1 and/or Operator 2 fail to observe par. d) of Clause 1.3.4, the Parties shall recalculate the Distribution Tariff delta and/or change the amount of investment into Telasi JSC as per Clause 1.1.1 to ensure the return and payback of investment as stipulated by this Memorandum.*\n\n*Calculation of the Distribution Tariff delta*\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Electric power export tariff, US cents/kWh, without the transportation costs* | *Delta of Distribution Tariff (hereinafter the \"D\" tetri/kWh, VAT inclusive* |\n| *6.0-6.5 inclusive* | *0.84* |\n| *6.5-7.5* | *0.6* |\n\n*2.1.3. Considering the above, for the period 2011-2025 the Parties have agreed to establish the long-term electric power Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC as follows:*\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Voltage of power transmission line (kV)* | *Tariffs (tetri/kWh, VAT exclusive)* |\n| *January 01, 2011 \u2013 September 01, 2016* | *September 01, 2016 \u2013 January 01, 2026* |\n| *Average* | *7.890* | *7.890+A* |\n| *0.4* | *8.080* | *8.080+A* |\n| *6/10* | *7.138* | *7.138+A* |\n| *35/110* | *1.800* | *1.800+A* |\n\n*Id.*, Clause 2.1.3; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 18; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 78-94. 7.89 tetri/kWh was the level the Distribution Tariff was set in the 2006 Tariff Resolution and the 2007 Memorandum until 1 September 2016. The Parties agree this rate is higher than Cost-Plus levels.\n\n*Id.*, Clauses 1.3.4, 2.1.1- 2.1.3. This was dependent on the commissioning of the new transmission line to be constructed by Georgia and the export price remaining within a specified band. If this was not the case, then the Parties would recalculate the Distribution Tariff and adjustment delta or change Telasi's investment commitments.\n\n192.\n\nThe 2011 Memorandum also provided that Telasi's WAPT from 2011-2025 was not to exceed 5.48 tetri/kWh and, if it did by more than 10% (namely, 6.028 tetri/kWh), \"\u2026the Consumer Tariff will correspondingly increase so that the Distribution Tariff (margin) of Telasi JSC would remain unchanged\".117 The adjustment would apply to the Consumer Tariff so as to maintain the Distribution Tariff unchanged if Telasi's WAPT decreased by more than 10%.\n\n*Id.*, Clauses 2.2.1-2.2.2. If Telasi's WAPT decreased by more than 10% then its Consumer Tariff would decrease correspondingly.\n\n193.\n\nThe 2011 Memorandum also provided that Telasi's Distribution Tariffs were to be adjusted every three years between 2011 and 2025 for a total of five times to account for currency exchange fluctuations and inflation.118 The Distribution Tariffs would be corrected upward in the event that the GEL declined against the USD by more than 7%, or if Georgia's average annual inflation rate exceeded 7%.\n\n*Id.*, Clauses 2.3.1-2.3.2.\n\n194.\n\nIn this regard, the relevant provisions of the 2011 Memorandum provided as follows:119\n\n*2.2 Weighted Average Purchase Tariff*\n\n*2.2.1 For 2011-2025 Telasi JSC will purchase electricity under direct contracts with power plants as well as from the Commercial Operator of the Electric Power System and shall form the annual electricity purchase portfolio with the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of no more than 5.48 ttri/kWh (VAT exclusive). The Weighted Average Purchase Tariff shall be calculated annually in the period from 01 September to 31 August of the subsequent year.*\n\n*2.2.2 If the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of Telasi JSC as per Clause 2.2.1 (VAT exclusive, including transmission and dispatching tariffs, reserve components and technical losses in the high voltage electrical grid) increases by over 10%, then the Consumer Tariff will correspondingly increase so that the Distribution Tariff (margin) of Telasi JSC would remain unchanged. During the calculation of increase of the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff, the increase of the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff for reasons set forth in Clauses 1.3 (purchase of electric power from the HPP Chain) and 1.2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 (increase of tariffs for Khrami HPP-1 JSC and Khrami HPP-2 JSC) is not considered.*\n\n*2.2.3 If, during 2011-2025, the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of Telasi JSC for any reasons decreases by over 10%, then the Consumer Tariff will correspondingly decrease so that the Distribution Tariff (margin) of Telasi JSC would remain unchanged.*\n\n*2.3 Adjustment of Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC*\n\n*2.3.1 The Parties have agreed that the Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC shall be adjusted taking into account inflation and change in the lari to US dollar exchange rate once every three years within the period 2011 - 2025 and 5 times in total, according to the following frequency:*\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Period | Duration | Adjustment date |\n| 1 | September 01, 2011 - September 01, 2013 | November 01, 2013 |\n| 2 | September 01. 2013 - September 01,2016 | November 01, 2016 |\n| 3 | September 01, 2016 - September 01, 2019 | November 01, 2019 |\n| 4 | September 01. 2019 - September 01, 2022 | November 01, 2022 |\n| 5 | September 01. 2022 - September 01, 2025 | November 01, 2025 |\n\n*2.3.2 The adjustment will be performed on the basis of any of the following factors:*\n\n*\u0430) the adjustment of the Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC on the basis of the inflation factor shall be made only if the inflation value calculated as follows:*\n\n*ik=((1+i1) x...x(1+in))^(1/n)-1*\n\n*where:*\n\n***i** - average annual inflation,*\n\n***ik** - inflation in the period,*\n\n***n** - number of years in the*\n\n*period,*\n\n***ik** - value of inflation*\n\n*is over 7 (seven) %. In this case, the adjustment will be applied based on the entire value of the calculated inflation ik.*\n\n*b) the adjustment of the Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC taking into account the change in lari to US dollar exchange rate shall be applied to the part of 30 (thirty) percent of the Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC if the change in the lari to US dollar exchange rate is more than 7 (seven) percent for the whole period.

In particular, the Claimants say Clause 1.2 codified the fixed Generation Tariffs contained at Clause 2.4 of the 2011 Memorandum, and Clauses 2.2 and 2.3 set out the same tariff adjustment mechanisms as Clause 2.5 of the 2011 Memorandum: Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.\n\n200.\n\nThe Khrami SPA also provides that:\n\n*1.15 Until the date of the Final Payment Date, the Government is obliged to deliver to the Buyer respective resolution of the \u2026 [NERC] or any other authorized body \u2026 establishing tariffs and terms of correction thereof for \u2026 [the Khrami Companies] as per the [2011] Memorandum and in accordance with Annex #1 to the present Agreement.*129\n\nKhrami SPA, C-0016, Clause 1.15.\n\n201.\n\nIn the event the Government failed to implement the Khrami SPA, Gardabani was entitled to rescind the contract and be indemnified for the consequences, for which the Respondents accepted joint and several liability to compensate.

Implementation of Telasi and the Khrami Companies' Tariffs under the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA: NERC Resolution No. 5**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nOn 7 April 2011, the NERC issued a resolution amending Resolution No. 33 which had set long-term tariffs and adjustment mechanisms applicable to both Telasi and the Khrami Companies (\"**NERC Resolution No. 5**\"). NERC Resolution No. 5 set the Khrami Companies' tariffs as agreed in the 2011 Memorandum (and the Khrami SPA) and their adjustment conditions.131 This occurred one week after the 2011 Memorandum was signed on 31 March 2011, and less than a week before the Khrami SPA was signed.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 5 on Amendments to NERC Resolution No. 33 dated 4 December 2008, dated 7 April 2011 (\"**NERC Resolution No. 5**\"), CL-0080. The resolution did not address Telasi's tariffs as they had been approved in NERC Resolution No. 33 dated 4 December 2008 and had not changed.\n\n203.\n\nClause 1.15 of the Khrami SPA, set out above, required the Government to deliver a resolution of the NERC establishing tariffs and the conditions for their adjustment in accordance with the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. As it had done with the 2007 Memorandum pursuant to Resolution No. 33, the NERC through its Resolution No. 5 implemented the agreed tariffs and adjustment mechanisms for the Khrami Companies and Telasi set out in the 2011 Memorandum and at Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA.

The 2011 Methodology**\n---------------------------\n\n204.\n\nOn 8 June 2011, two months after the conclusion of the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, the NERC adopted a new generally applicable tariff-setting methodology (the \"**2011 Methodology**\").133\n\nNERC Resolution No. 8 on approval of the Methodology for Setting Electricity Tariffs, dated 8 June 2011 (\"**2011 Methodology**\"), CL-0081.\n\n205.\n\nLike the 1998 Methodology before it, the 2011 Methodology was not relevant for Telasi and the Khrami Companies because the Parties' recently agreed tariff scheme in the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, implemented by NERC Resolution No. 5 continued to apply. Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology (entitled \"**Transitional Provision**\") provided as follows:\n\n*The conditions defined by this methodology shall not apply to enterprises (before the expiration of the period of validity of the tariff), for which long-term tariffs were set based on transactions concluded by the state.*134\n\n*Id.*, Art. 27.\n\n206.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 27 means that companies, such as Telasi and the Khrami Companies, which had reached specific tariff agreements with the Government, such as the 2011 Memorandum and Khrami SPA, were excluded from the scope of the 2011 Methodology's application.\n\n207.\n\nThe Parties' positions differ as to whether the same applied for the 2013 Memorandum, discussed below, which was concluded while the 2011 Methodology was still in effect. The Claimants say Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology means that the 2013 Memorandum governed Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs for the entire duration of those agreements.135 According to them, as long as the 2011 Methodology applied, the tariff regimes contained in the Khrami SPA and the 2013 (and 2011) Memorandum governed. The Respondents say that going forward, the NERC would retain its discretion under Article 11(1) of the Law on Electricity as to whether to take into account any further agreements concluded by the Government.136 According to the Respondents, Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology provided a transitional regime for that Methodology only.137 According to them, since the 2013 Memorandum did not pre-exist the 2011 Methodology, the Claimants could not have expected that the tariffs under the 2013 Memorandum would remain exempted from any new tariff Methodology, which the NERC had announced it was developing in late 2012.138\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 90.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 94.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nSee *Id*., \u00b6 159.\n\n**L. Construction of the HPP**\n------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nAlthough the 2013 Memorandum*, infra*, at issue in these disputes has since replaced the previous memoranda, the following divergence in the Parties' positions is relevant to the factual background. The Parties disagree over whether Inter RAO was obliged, as a condition of Telasi's receipt of the increase generated by those tariffs under the 2007 and 2011 Memoranda, to invest Telasi's additional revenues to construct the HPP Chain.139\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 33-35; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 19; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 63-71.\n\n209.\n\nTo be clear, it is common ground between the Parties that the HPP obligation did not carry over into the 2013 Memorandum. The Claimants were released from this obligation\n\n210.\n\nAfter the 2011 Memorandum was signed, Inter RAO took steps intended to fulfill its obligation to construct the new HPP Chain by commissioning a feasibility study from international engineering consultant, P\u00f6yry on 30 September 2011 to estimate the costs of constructing the HPP Chain.140 On 15 February 2012, Inter RAO presented P\u00f6yry's estimate of approximately USD 280-290 million to the then Minister of Energy, Mr. Khetaguri.141 This estimate was considerably more than the preliminary estimate of USD 193 million recorded at Clause 1.3.1 of the 2011 Memorandum, which had been prepared by Georgian company Stucky Caucasus prior to the conclusion of the 2011 Memorandum.142 The increase in costs was attributed to incorrect geological and hydrological data used in the initial Stucky Caucasus study, which was preliminary and did not involve surveying work.143\n\nConstruction contract No. 11/980 between Telasi and P\u00f6yry, dated 30 September 2011, C-0018; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 37; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 59; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.

This study also estimated the construction cost of a TPP at approximately USD 280 million.145 The MOE considered that this estimate was excessive.146 Following continued discussions with Inter RAO over this project, it was agreed that the MOE would solicit proposals from other companies.147\n\nMirsiyapov I, \u00b6 32: \"the reason that the Minister forewent the HPP project was based on the financing of such construction\" because he was \"evidently well aware that it would not be possible to finance an expensive construction project without an increase in the consumer tariffs by \u2026 Telasi\".\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 98; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 35.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 17.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 38; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 98.\n\n212.\n\nBetween June and August 2012, the MOE and Inter RAO negotiated a financial model for the latter's operations in Georgia, including the construction of a TPP. These negotiations progressed in parallel with Georgia's tender for proposals for the construction of a TPP from other companies.148 On 5 June 2012, Inter RAO sent to the MOE a revised financial model which included the construction of a TPP. The financial model was accompanied by an explanatory note.149 According to the explanatory note, the model included a premium on Telasi's tariffs, the doubling of the Khrami Companies' tariffs in the 2011 Memorandum as of 2014, and tariffs for the new TPP. The model also introduced, for the first time, the concept of \"Required Gross Marginal Return\" (the \"**RGMR**\"), which was stated to be a \"key performance criterion\" for Inter RAO's subsidiaries in Georgia, to be guaranteed by the Government.150 According to the explanatory note, if the actual gross margin deviated by more than 5% of the RGMR, an adjustment would be made to the actual gross margin in the following year. The explanatory note did not address adjustment to the various tariffs for increases in WAPT or inflation and foreign exchange rates.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 19.\n\nLetter from Mr. Mirsiyapov to Mr. Khetaguri, dated 5 June 2012, attaching Explanatory Note to the Financial and Economic Model, C-0022; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 99.\n\nLetter from Mr. Mirsiyapov to Mr. Khetaguri, dated 5 June 2012, attaching Explanatory Note to the Financial and Economic Model, C-0022.

The Respondents say that the RGMR concept was a key indicator of the viability of Inter RAO's investment which Mr. Mirsiyapov's letter to Mr. Khetaguri specifically stated would \"not create excess revenues\", but rather \"enable [Telasi] to carry out break-even operating activities\" and \"ensure the return of funds spent for the acquisition of [the Khrami Companies] as well as the return of investments in the construction\" of the new TPP.152 The Respondents say that the financial model provided by Inter RAO built in a 5% profit margin on Inter RAO's operations in Georgia.153\n\nLetter from Mr. Mirsiyapov to Mr. Khetaguri, dated 5 June 2012, attaching Explanatory Note to the Financial and Economic Model, C-0022; Mirsiyapov II, \u00b6 17; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 40*.*\n\nLetter from Mr. Mirsiyapov to Mr. Khetaguri, dated 5 June 2012, attaching Explanatory Note to the Financial and Economic Model, C-0022, p. 3; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 99.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 99.\n\n214.\n\nA Turkish contractor, \u1e08alik Enerj\u1e2d, was ultimately selected by the Government to build the TPP at an estimated cost of USD 199.5 million, and the contracts were concluded on 2 August 2012, without Inter RAO's knowledge.154 At a meeting on 18 August 2012, the Parties attempted to reach agreement on a financial model for Inter ROA's operations in Georgia, including the construction of a TPP and other economic issues, but these efforts failed and Inter RAO informed Georgia that it was not interested in pursuing the TPP project on the terms suggested by Georgia. The MOE was of the view that Inter RAO was required to invest its excess investment margin revenues intended for the construction of the HPP under the 2011 Memorandum (the alleged \"super profit\") into the TPP project, but Inter RAO declined.155\n\nConstruction contract between Partnership Fund JSC and \u1e08alik Enerj\u1e2d Sanayi Ve Ticaret, 2 August 2012, C-0023; Supply contract between Partnership Fund JSC and \u1e08alik Enerj\u1e2d Sanayi Ve Ticaret, 2 August 2012, C-0024; Valishvili I, \u00b6 18; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 42; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 100; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 38: Mr. Mirsiyapov says Inter RAO learned of the \u1e08alik Enerj\u1e2d contracts on 9 August 2012.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 102 and the sources cited there.\n\n215.\n\nInter RAO and the Government met again on 27-28 August 2012 to discuss Inter RAO's participation in the financing of the new TPP. Ms. Valishvili says she explained to Inter RAO that should it decide to pull out of the TPP project, it would nevertheless have to reinvest the accumulated \"super profit\" (which the Government calculated at USD 50 million) it had gained from the high Distribution Tariffs under the 2011 Memorandum to finance the TPP.156 Otherwise the Government would have to reduce Telasi's Distribution Tariff accordingly or compel Inter RAO to purchase 15% of its electricity at its own cost.157 The Parties dispute the interpretation of the 15% purchase requirement in Clause 1.3.2 of the 2011 Memorandum.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 103-105; C-0191 / R-0058, Draft Financial Model dated 9 September 2021; C-0192, Email from Mr. Mirsiyapov to Ms. Valishvili, 12 September 2021, attaching Revised Draft Financial Model. This financial model contemplated that Inter RAO would finance the TPP project with an equity contribution of USD 50 million plus loan financing. The Claimants say that they provided this model to the MOE based on Mr. Khetaguri's request that Inter RAO prepare a forecast based on a scenario where Inter RAO alone would finance the construction of the TPP. The Claimants emphasize that the financial model was a draft, and that, in any event, the proposed funding was to be a combination of equity investment of Group funds and significant loan financing. *See* Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 44. The Claimants say they had not accumulated the funds for the proposed equity contribution. Further, they say the parties had not agreed on the assumptions underlying the draft model nor how Inter RAO would recover and earn a return on the possible equity investment in the TPP.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 22; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimants deny that they were obliged under the 2007 and 2011 Memoranda to invest a portion of Telasi's revenues into the new HPP Chain. They say Inter RAO had discretion to retain a portion of the revenues generated by the investment margin in Telasi's long-term tariffs as compensation in exchange for the waiver of certain claims open to them under the Telasi SPA for compensation for losses caused by adverse tax changes and to ensure the profitability of Telasi.158 They say that Telasi's Distribution Tariff was set in the 2011 Memorandum to enable it to pay the increased generation tariffs of the Khrami Companies, which, in turn, were intended to permit Inter RAO to recover the cost paid to purchase those companies. Therefore, Telasi's tariffs were intended to cover more than only its investment commitments.159 Further, under the 2011 Memorandum, the construction of the new HPP Chain was not a certainty. They say this is why the 2007 and 2011 Memoranda provided Telasi with an \"alternative\" to building the HPP in the form of the financial requirement to purchase 15% of Telasi's electricity from high-cost renewable energy sources if Inter RAO and the Government failed to come to an agreement to construct the new HPP Chain.160 The Claimants also say that the USD 104 million purchase price that Inter RAO paid for the Khrami Companies under the Khrami SPA was three times higher than its real value, and that it did not fully recover this value under the 2011 Memorandum and Khrami SPA because the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs were too low.161\n\n2007 Memorandum, C-0005 / R-0015, Recitals, Clause 1.6; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 33(b); *see also*, \u00b6 84: The 2013 Memorandum also reflected the Parties' settlement of the disputed tax claims that had arisen in August 2012.\n\nRespondents' Reply, \u00b6 34; Zavrazhnov I, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; Zavrazhnov II, \u00b6 18; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 15-22.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 31; 2007 Memorandum, C-0005 / R-0015, Clause 7.2; 2011 Memorandum, C-0015 / R-0019, Clause 1.3.2.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 28, fn 36; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 35; Mirsiyapov II, \u00b6 13.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondents say the higher than Cost-Plus tariffs in the 2007 and 2011 Memoranda were granted on the condition that Inter RAO invests the full amount of the excess revenues162 generated through Telasi's tariffs in Georgia.163 Their position is that the 15% financial penalty was not an alternative to building the new HPP Chain. Rather, it contemplates that Inter RAO would eventually build the plant, and would suffer the financial penalty until the HPP Chain generated power.164 The Respondents say that the Government made clear during the negotiations on the Memoranda that it did not agree that Inter RAO could retain the investment margin as profit or spend it freely, but that it was to finance the construction of the HPP Chain.165 In support, the Respondents refer to a January 2011 Inter RAO internal presentation slide, which they say shows that Inter RAO understood that the Investment Margin revenues were earmarked for the new HPP Chain:\n\n*Tariff policy of JSC Telasi fixed until September 2015 [allows Telasi] [t]o finance [its] investment program at the minimum necessary level [and] accumulate funds \u2026 of $100 million for the construction of a 100 MW hydroelectric power station.*\n\n*Construction of a new [HPP] \u2026 with a capacity of 90 MW with [its] own funds of JSC \"Telasi\" and \u2026 a loan of 113 million USD, and its compensation by including this amount in the distribution tariff of JSC \"Telasi\".*166\n\nRevenues over and above justified costs, plus a reasonable return, which Respondents suggest is 4-5%.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 28; Khetaguri II, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 29.\n\nEmail from Kostyunin to Markov attaching Inter RAO's performance model, 20 January 2011, R-0078, Section 2, p. 5; Section 5, p. 8.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondents also say Inter RAO's internal emails show that it accumulated USD 80 million as of 31 January 2011 through Telasi's tariffs for the construction of the new HPP Chain, and that it planned to raise the balance of the initial estimated construction cost of USD 193 million set out in the 2011 Memorandum through external loans.167\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 31; Email from Parshin to Kostyunin with PowerPoint presentation on Inter RAO's cashflows, dated 31 January 2011, R-0079; 2011 Memorandum, C-0015 / R-0019, Clause 1.1.3.\n\n219.\n\nThe Respondents say that the Parties understood that Inter RAO would recover the purchase price it paid for the Khrami Companies plus a reasonable return on its investment through the investment margin in Telasi's tariffs (agreed in the 2007 Memorandum). This was implemented by significantly increasing the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs between January 2014 and December 2021.168 The Respondents say the 2011 Memorandum ensured that Inter RAO would receive through the added investment margin in Telasi's Distribution Tariffs an advance on the cost of constructing the new HPP and revenues sufficient to recover its full investment in the Khrami Companies. This increase was referred to by the Parties in the proceedings as the \"Supplement\" to the Khrami Companies' tariffs. The Respondents say the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs were high enough to allow for full recovery of Inter RAO's investment, and refer to Inter RAO's internal correspondence in January 2011 rejecting Mr. Mirsiyapov's proposal that Inter RAO's returns should be doubled.169\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 36; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 85.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40; Khetaguri II, \u00b6 27; Zavrazhnov I, \u00b6 23.; Email from Kostyunin to Markov (Inter RAO) attaching Inter RAO's performance model, 20 January 2011, Section 7, R-0078, p. 10.\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondents say Inter RAO refused to invest the portion of the investment margin in Telasi's tariffs, which they maintain was earmarked to build the new HPP Chain and, instead, retained these funds as a \"super profit\".170 To be clear, the Respondents do not contend that Inter RAO's refusal to participate in the TPP project breached the 2011 Memorandum. Rather, the Respondents' position is that regardless of whether it chose to participate in the TPP project with \u1e08alik Enerj\u1e2d, Inter RAO remained obligated to construct the HPP Chain using the revenues that it had received through the Supplement. Accordingly, although the Parties had concluded that the construction of an HPP Chain was prohibitively expensive, Inter RAO was contractually bound to agree with Georgia on a reasonable alternative.171\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 43; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 47.\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondents deny the Claimants' allegations that the then Deputy Minister of Energy, Ms. Valishvili, threatened to cause Telasi's ruin with the 15% financial penalty pursuant to the 2011 Memorandum, or that then Minister of Finance and former Minister of Energy, Mr. Khetaguri, threatened Inter RAO with negative tax consequences.172 The Respondents also challenge the relevance of Mr. Mirsiyapov's testimony that Inter RAO was unprofitable as of June 2012, and thus did not accumulate substantial funds earmarked towards fulfilling its HPP construction obligation. The Respondents say Telasi did not have its accumulated super profit from the Supplement (between USD 50 and 67.9 million by 31 December 2012) in its bank accounts in late 2012 because Inter RAO used these funds for its own benefit. They say this is confirmed by the NERC's audit of Telasi's operations in January-April 2012.173\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 48. For more details, *see* \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; NERC's Audit Act for Telasi, dated 12 April 2012, R-0069, p. 60.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants deny that their decision not to invest in the TPP led to the alleged super profits. They say the 2011 Memorandum did not contemplate Inter RAO building a TPP and that there was no agreement that if the TPP project proceeded, Telasi would fund it rather than \"investing in construction and recovering the capital expense through operations\".174 Further, Telasi had not accumulated USD 50 million in revenues in February 2012.175 The Claimants explain that their reference to USD 50 million is from a draft financial model Inter RAO sent to the MOE on 12 September 2012, based on Mr. Khetaguri's request that Inter RAO prepare a forecast based on a scenario where Inter RAO alone would finance the construction of the TPP. The Claimants say that the proposed USD 50 million was to be a combination of equity investment of Group funds and significant loan financing.176 Mr. Mirsiyapov's testimony is that Telasi had not accumulated funds that could have covered the equity portion of their proposed USD 50 million investment in full.177 Further, his evidence is that the parties had not agreed on the assumptions underlying the aforementioned draft financial model circulated in September 2012, either at the meeting between the parties on 8-9 September, or later, since they had not resolved the issue of how Inter RAO would recover and earn a return on a potential equity investment in the TPP project with an acceptable rate of return.178\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 43.\n\n*See* Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 44.\n\nDraft Financial Model dated 9 September 2021, C-0191 / R-0058; Email from Mirsiyapov toValishvili dated 12 September 2021, attaching Revised Draft Financial Model, C-0192.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 44; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 45; Mirsiyapov II, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 44; Mirsiyapov II, \u00b6\u00b6 28-30; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 47.\n\n**M. The Negotiations Leading up to the Conclusion of the 2013 Memorandum**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nParliamentary elections in the Fall of 2012 interrupted the Parties' discussions regarding the agreement which would later become the 2013 Memorandum.179 On 1 October 2012, a change in government occurred in Georgia (the Dream Party Coalition came into power) and, on 25 October 2012, a new cabinet was appointed. This new cabinet included Prime Minister, Mr. Biszina Ivanishvili, and Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, Mr. Kakha Kaladze. One of their top priorities was to fulfil a campaign promise to reduce the price of electricity for Georgian household consumers by the end of 2012.180\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 55; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 108-126.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 109; Bachiashvili I, \u00b6 10.\n\n224.\n\nFrom November 2012 to March 2013, Inter RAO's Messrs Mirsiyapov and Markov (both of whom had been involved in negotiating the 2011 Memorandum with the prior Government) and the Minister of Energy, Mr. Kaladze, his Deputy Minister of Energy, Mr. Ilia Eloshvili, and the Government's consultant, Mr. George Bachiashvili,181 negotiated what would become the 2013 Memorandum.\n\nThe Respondents say Mr. Bachiashvili was a \"consultant to the Government\": Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 112; Bachiashvili I, \u00b6 9. The Claimants say Mr. Bachiashvili played a leading role in meetings and with all commercial decisions: Mirsiyapov II, \u00b6\u00b6 34-38; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 46.\n\n225.\n\nMr. Bachiashvili played an important role in the meetings between Georgia and Inter RAO in their efforts to conclude the 2013 Memorandum, from November 2012 to March 2013.182 From November 2012 until August 2013, Mr. Bachiashvili served as a consultant to the Georgian Government and as the Deputy CEO of the Georgian State-owned Partnership Fund JSC, which is a party to the 2013 Memorandum through its minority interest in Telasi, and which provides equity financing for energy, hospitality and manufacturing projects in Georgia.183 He was appointed to these roles by the then Prime Minister, Mr. Ivanishvili, shortly after he came into power in October 2012.\n\nMirsiyapov II, \u00b6\u00b6 34-38; *see e.g.*, C-0029, Email from Eloshvili to Mirsiyapov dated 12 December 2012, attaching a further draft memorandum (\"**Draft Memorandum of 12 December 2012**\") (in the email, Mr. Eloshvili writes, \"Please see attached the memorandum with a few changes made by Giorgi Bachiashvili\".).\n\nBachiashvili I, \u00b6 7.\n\n226.\n\nIn September 2013, approximately five months after the conclusion of the 2013 Memorandum, Prime Minister Ivanishvili stepped down from his role as Prime Minister and, at the same time, Mr. Bachiashvili returned to work for Mr. Ivanishvili in a private sector capacity as the CEO of the Georgian Co-Investment Fund, which is privately financed by Mr. Ivanishvili. The Georgian Co-Investment Fund invests in a variety of energy, manufacturing, real estate and agricultural projects, and as its CEO, Mr. Bachiashvili manages assets in excess of USD 2 billion.184\n\nBachiashvili I, \u00b6 8.\n\n227.\n\nWhen the parties met on 29 November 2012, among other things, Inter RAO sought to be formally released from certain investment commitments, including the new HPP Chain, and a guarantee that Telasi would recover through its tariffs certain costs and a reasonable margin.185 The Government sought to reduce certain categories of Telasi's Consumer Tariffs before the end of 2012, in line with its election campaign promise of cheaper electricity. Inter RAO, Telasi and the Khrami Companies accepted a temporary reduction in certain tariff categories subject to final settlement of all issues that had been left unresolved with the previous Government.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 47; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113.\n\n228.\n\nOn 6 December 2012, Inter RAO's Mr. Mirsiyapov sent to Mr. Eloshvili and Mr. Bachiashvili proposed terms for the new memorandum, along with a financial model forecasting Telasi's overall financial performance for the duration of the agreement.186 The spreadsheet contained a summary tab entitled \"margin\" and identified the categories of Telasi's costs that Inter RAO wanted the Government to guarantee would be recovered.187 This financial model would eventually become Appendix 2 to the 2013 Memorandum.\n\nEmail from Inter RAO to Georgia dated 6 December 2012, attaching Prerequisites for activity of the Inter RAO Companies; R-0021, Email from Inter RAO to Georgia dated 6 December 2012, attaching Telasi's financial model (\"Draft Financial and Economic Model for Telasi\"), R-0020; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 114. Inter RAO's proposed terms were described as the \"preconditions for the long-term activity of the [Inter ROA] companies as agreed at the meeting of 05.12.2012\". Among the pre-requisites listed was a condition that the average weighted purchase tariff of Telasi in the period from 2013 to 2025 would not be more than 6.028 Tetri/kWh and that the current tariffs of the Khrami Companies would be taken into account when calculating the average weighted purchase tariff of Telasi. A further pre-requisite was \"[p]rofitability of Telasi JSC on the net profit is 5%\".\n\nDraft Financial and Economic Model for Telasi. The spreadsheet forecasts rate of growth and other costs between 2011-2025, R-0021.\n\n229.\n\nOn 7 December 2012, Mr. Bachiashvili sent Mr. Mirsiyapov Georgia's comments on Inter RAO's proposed terms in the 6 December 2012 financial model:188\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n**Telasi JSC:**\n\n**\u2022 Average compound rate of the productive supply (in 2013-2015) is 2.03% per year.

He says that he and Mr. Eloshvili explained to Mr. Mirsiyapov that Georgia wanted to be able to take an informed decision on the overall level of profitability for Telasi reflected in the financial model. It is here that they say that Mr. Mirsiyapov stated that Inter RAO was committed to operating in the Georgian energy sector in the long-term and was not seeking excessive levels of profit. Mr. Mirsiyapov says that he has no recollection of Mr. Bachiashvili or Mr. Eloshvili saying they needed to make an informed decision on the overall profitability of Telasi. He says that he did say that Inter RAO was not seeking to make exorbitant profits, by which he meant that Inter RAO was not expecting wild rates of return on investment and profitability. However, that did not mean that Inter RAO did not expect to make a profit and grow its business. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Mirsiyapov agreed to send Georgia an updated financial model and a draft of the new memorandum.\n\nBachiashvili I, \u00b6 16; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 116.\n\n231.\n\nOn 10 December 2012, Inter RAO sent Georgia a draft memorandum which included as an appendix the financial model. Georgia marked up the draft and sent it back to Inter RAO on 12 December 2012.190 In this draft, one of the key provisions in dispute in this arbitration (Clause 2.3 of the 2013 Memorandum) reads as follows:\n\n2.3. Telasi JSC\u2019s average weighted electric power procurement tariff\n\n2.3.1. From 2013 through 2025, Telasi JSC will procure electric power under direct contracts with power plants and from the Electricity Grid Commercial Operator and will form an annual portfolio of electric power procurements with an average weighted tariff of no more than 6.028 tetri/kWh (without VAT). The average weighted electric power procurement tariff is calculated annually for the period front 01 September through 31 August of each year.\n\n2.3.2. If the average weighted electric power procurement tariff for Telasi JSC described in subclause 2.3.1. (without VAT, including the tariffs for transmission and dispatch, reserve components and technical losses within the high voltage electricity transmission grid) goes up, there will be a simultaneous rise in the consumer tariff to maintain Telasi JSC\u2019s distribution tariff unchanged in consideration of the terms of cl. 2.2.4.\n\n2.3.3. In calculating the rise in the average weighted electric power procurement tariff, account is not taken of any rise in the average weighted electric power procurement tariff for the reasons set forth in clause 2.4.1. (a rise in the tariffs for AO Khrami-1 and AO Khrami-2).\n\n2.3.4. The Parties have agreed that, from 2013 through 2025, Telasi JSC\u2019s distribution tariff will be adjusted for inflation and any change in the GEL/USD exchange rate in accordance with subclauses 2.3.1. and 2.3.2. ofthe Memorandum dated 31.03.2011.\n\n2.3.5. When the average weighted electric pow'er procurement tariff of Telasi JSC is calculated for 2013 through 2025, account is taken of the AO Khrami-1 and AO Khrami-2 in place when this Memorandum is signed.\n\n2.3.6. If the actual procurement tariff between 2013 and 2016 goes up from 6.028 tetri kWh by more than 0.1 tetri/kWh, the Parties recognise the need for additional negotiations on raising Telasi JSC . di. stri. bution consumer tariff for the year following the current year.\n\nDraft Memorandum of 12 December 2012, C-0029.\n\n232.\n\nOn 15 December 2012, Inter RAO proposed substantial amendments, including the addition of the NERC as a party to the memorandum and a clause providing that \"[t]he Government of Georgia and the [NERC], within the scope of their competence, agree to approve the tariff plans and conditions for their adjustment\".191 Inter RAO also proposed the addition of a clause providing that the Government would compensate Inter RAO for losses caused by a change in Georgian legislation subsequent to the conclusion of a new memorandum.192\n\nEmail from Mirsiyapov to Eloshvili dated 15 December 2012, attaching a further draft memorandum (\"**Draft Memorandum of 15 December 2012**\"), R-0024, Clause 1.5.\n\nDraft Memorandum of 15 December 2012, R-0024, Clause 5.2.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondents suggest that Inter RAO sought to add the NERC as a party to the agreement because it knew that the transitional regime at Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology would not apply to any new memorandum concluded with Georgia after the entry into force of the 2011 Methodology.193 The Claimants do not dispute that they requested that the NERC be added as a party to the 2013 Memorandum, but say that at no point did Georgia represent that the NERC could override the tariff related provisions and adjustment mechanisms in the Agreement. From the Claimants' perspective, \"the 2011 methodology, like the 1998 methodology before it, was irrelevant to Telasi and the Khrami companies because their recently agreed, new, tailored tariff scheme continued to apply\".194 The Claimants also say that at the time the 2013 Memorandum was signed there was no draft of the memorandum and no one knew what its terms would be.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 122; *see e.g.*, Tr.

The 2012 Transitional Memorandum**\n---------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Parties had originally aimed to conclude their tariff agreement by the end of 2012, but were unable to do so. In light of the importance for the new Government of reducing Consumer Tariffs for household consumers,195 The Parties negotiated a transitional memorandum. The last draft of that Memorandum was exchanged between the Government and Inter RAO on 19 December 2012. The Claimants say that it reflected certain changes that the NERC requested, which shows that the NERC was involved in the negotiation process:196\n\nFrom: Ilia Eloshvili [mailto:I.Eloshvili@menr.gov.ge]\n\nSent: Wednesday, December 19, 2012 8:11 PM\n\nTo: MIRSIYAPOV Ilnar I.\n\nCc: gbachiashvili@fund.ge\n\n**Subject: FW:**\n\nIlnar,\n\nFirst of all, it is a pity that Devi has problems.

Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 34.\n\n237.\n\nOn 27 December 2012, the NERC implemented the tariffs agreed in the 2012 Transitional Memorandum through a resolution (\"**NERC Resolution No. 23**\").200\n\nThe NERC implemented the 2012 Transitional Memorandum through CL-0082, NERC Resolution No. 23 on Amendments to NERC Resolution No. 33 dated 4 December 2008, dated 27 December 2012 (\"**NERC Resolution No. 23**\"); Claimants' Opening Presentation, Demonstrative No. 4; Tr.

The 2013 Memorandum**\n--------------------------\n\n239.\n\nNegotiations resumed in mid-January 2013, with further drafts of the memorandum exchanged in the period from January to March. On 31 March 2013, the Government, the Partnership Fund JSC (Georgian State-owned entity which held Georgia's 24.5% stake in Telasi), Inter RAO, Telasi, the Khrami Companies and Mtkvari Energy LLC (owned by Inter RAO) entered into the 2013 Memorandum.202 It supersedes the 2007, 2011 and 2012 Memoranda and sets out long-term tariff regimes for Telasi and the Khrami Companies.\n\n2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028.

The value of the Target Investment Allowance or the Gross Revenue Deficit is defined based on the results of calculating the actual values of the Gross Revenue and the Required Gross Revenue of Telasi JSC for the previous reporting period carried out by an independent auditor.*\n\n*2.1.10 In the period from 2017 to 2025, the Target Investment Allowance will be distributed as follows: 50% remains at the disposal of Telasi JSC; 50% is allocated to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia in accordance with section 2.1.11 (subject to the exceptions set out in section 2.6.8).*\n\n*2.1.11 The part of the Target Investment Allowance (subject to the exception set out in section 2.6.8), which is distributed in favor of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia as a result of a completed reporting period, may be used by way of increasing the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff for Telasi JSC for the subsequent reporting period according to the decision of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia. Other forms for the distribution of the Target Investment Allowance are also permitted (subject to the exception set out in Section 2.6.8); such forms will be established by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia in compliance with the legislation effective at the time. To its end, Telasi JSC shall make every effort to organize the appropriate corporate procedures for approving of the suggested form for the distribution of the Target Investment Allowance.*\n\n*2.1.12 The actual amount of the Gross Revenue Deficit as determined by the results of a reporting period shall be compensated to Telasi JSC by means of raising the Consumer Tariff of Telasi JSC for the subsequent reporting period, as stipulated by the provisions of Sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 2.2.4 of this Memorandum[\u2026]*\n\n*2.2. Long-term electricity tariff to be set by Telasi JSC*\n\n*2.2.1. The Parties agree that the long-term electricity tariffs may be equally [Claimants Translation:] profitable / [Respondents Translation:] financially beneficial for both JSC Telasi and electricity consumers of all categories, including the general public. Long-term tariffs will enable Telasi JSC to plan its investments and operating activities with the maximum possible accuracy and high efficiency, whereas consumers will obtain the possibility to plan their expenditures for consumed electricity. Keeping in mind the understanding of the need for tariff optimization for separate consumer groups within the next years, the Parties have agreed that the Consumer Tariff of purchasing the electricity of Telasi JSC within the period 2013 - 2016 shall be decreased:*\n\n\u2022 *by 4 tetri / kWh with VAT (3.39 tetri / kWh excluding VAT) for consumers of the Population category with the connection on the line with 0.4 kV voltage and consumption of up to 101 kWh per month, inclusive,*\n\n\u2022 *by 3.54 tetri / kWh with VAT (3 tetri / kWh excluding VAT) for consumers of the Population category with the connection on the line with 0.4 kV voltage and consumption from 101 to 301 kWh per month, inclusive,*\n\n*and the establishment of long-term electricity tariff of Telasi JSC in respect to these groups of consumers over the years at the following levels:*\n\nTable 1.

In order to ensure breakeven results of operation of Telasi JSC in the period from 2013 to 2025, The Parties have agreed that the annual Consumer Electricity Tariff of Telasi JSC shall ensure the achievement of the annual amount of the Required Gross Revenue of Telasi JSC stipulated by this Memorandum. In this regard, if the Required Gross Revenue amount of Telasi JSC is actually not achieved as of the end of the reporting year, the Consumer Tariff of Telasi JSC shall be raised since September 1 of the year following the reporting year to the level enabling to compensate, during one year, the Required Gross Revenue amount which was not achieved within the previous year.*\n\n*2.2.3. In the period from 01.04.2013 to 31.12.2016, the Consumer Tariff of Telasi JSC shall not be revised subject to the compliance with the requirements of sections 2.1.2, 2.2.2 and 5.2 hereof.*\n\n*2.2.4. The calculation of the Target Investment Allowance or Gross Revenue Deficit is performed annually starting from 2013. In the period from 2013 to 2016, the Target Investment Allowance obtained in any of the reporting periods is adjusted by the amount of Gross Revenue Deficits obtained within the subsequent reporting periods after the formation of the stated Target Investment Allowance in such manner that the first distribution of the Target Investment Allowance in accordance with Sections 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 of this Memorandum is executed according to the results of 2016.*\n\n*2.3. The weighted average tariff of Telasi JSC for the purchase of electricity*\n\n*2.3.1. In the period from 2013 to 2025 Telasi JSC shall purchase electricity under direct contracts with power plants as well as from the Commercial Operator of the Electrical System and shall form the annual electricity purchase portfolio with the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of no more than 6.028 tetri/kWh. The Weighted average purchase tariff shall be calculated annually in the period from 01 September to 31 August of every year. The maximum level of the weighted average purchase tariff established in this section shall not apply for the purposes of calculation of the Weighted average purchase tariff in accordance with section 2.1.11 hereof.*\n\n*2.3.2. If the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of the electricity of Telasi JSC exceeds the maximum level stipulated by Section 2.3.1, the Consumer Tariff shall be simultaneously increased in such manner that the Gross Revenue of Telasi JSC is not changed.*\n\n*2.3.3. When calculating the amount of the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff increase of Telasi JSC (only for the purpose of Section 2.3.1), an increase of the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff for the reasons stipulated by Section 2.4.1 (the increase of tariffs for Khrami HPP-1 JSC and Khrami HPP-2 JSC) is not taken into account.*\n\n*2.3.4. The parties agreed that the Distribution Tariff of Telasi JSC shall be adjusted with respect to inflation and change in lari to US dollar exchange rate once in three years within the period 2013 - 2025 and 5 times in total according to the following frequency:*\n\nTable 3.

The adjustment shall thereby be applied to the whole amount of a change in lari to US dollar exchange rate.*\n\n*This adjustment and its size will be determined [Claimants: in consultation with / Respondents: with the approval of] the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia.*\n\n*2.3.5. When calculating the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of Telasi JSC (only for the purpose of Section 2.3.1) for the period 2013 - 2025, the tariffs of Khrami HPP-1 JSC and Khrami HPP-2 JSC effective at the moment of signing this Memorandum are taken into account.*\n\n*2.4. Long-term tariff of Khrami HPP-1 JSC and Khrami HPP-2 JSC*\n\n*2.4.1. Until December 31, 2013, inclusive, the tariffs of Khrami HPP-1 JSC and Khrami HPP-2 JSC will remain unchanged at 2.3 tetri / kWh and 3.5 tetri / kWh, respectively, as they were approved by the Resolution of the National Commission for Energy and Water Regulation of Georgia No. 4 of April 1, 2009. For the purposes of return on INTER RAO's investment in respect of acquisition of Khrami HPP-1 JSC and Khrami HPP-2 JSC for the period from 01.01.2014 to 12.31.2021, the tariffs of Khrami HPP-1 and JSC Khrami HPP-2 JSC will be set according to the table below:*\n\n*...*\n\nTable 4. Tariffs of Khrami HPP-1 and Khrami HPP-2 (tetri/kWh, excluding VAT)\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **until December 31, 2013.** | **from Jenuary 01, 2014 to December 31, 2013.** | **from January 01, 2019 to December 31, 2021.** | **after 2021** |\n| **Khrami HPP-1 JSC** | **2.3** | **8.2** | **7.7** | **263** |\n| **Khrami HPP-2 JSC** | **3.5** | **9.4** | **8.9** | **3.5** |\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*2.6. Investment commitments*\n\n*2.6.1. The Parties have agreed that from October 1, 2018 till January 1, 2025 with regard to fulfilment of INTER RAO obligations under Sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 of the memorandum on cooperation in the electricity energy sector and the implementation of agreements reached earlier dated 31.03.2011, Telasi JSC shall purchase 15% of its annual electricity purchases on a monthly basis from hydro power plants and/or renewable sources electrical power plants and commissioned in Georgia after 31.03.2011. The Parties agree that the mechanism of the performance of INTER RAO obligations established in sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 of the memorandum on cooperation in the electric energy sector and the performance of agreements reached earlier dated 31.03.2011 is specified in sections 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4 hereof.*\n\n*2.6.2. The Parties have agreed that Telasi JSC will be obliged to purchase the amount of electricity specified in Section 2.6.1 from electricity producers nominated for the following year by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia. At the same time, electricity suppliers are selected based on the highest bid value for each kWh until the target volume of Telasi JSC's purchases is achieved in accordance with section 2.6.1. This procedure involves the ranking of suppliers and the amounts of electricity offered by such supplies based on the price of offer, starting with the highest price. After that, Telasi JSC shall buy the amount of electricity from the supplier with the highest price of the offer. If the said amount of electricity is not sufficient to achieve the target purchase level of Telasi JSC in accordance with section 2.6.1, Telasi JSC buys electricity from the next supplier in the ranking list, and so on, until the target amount of purchases for Telasi JSC in accordance with section 2.6.1 is reached.*\n\n*2.6.3. The cost of the purchase of the target amount of electricity in accordance with Section 2.6.1 is taken into account for the calculation of the Weighted Average Purchase Tariff of Telasi JSC. The total Weighted Average Purchase tariff of Telasi JSC with due account for the amount of purchases provided for in section 2.6.1 may not exceed the limit established in section 2.3.1.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*5. LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES*\n\n*5.1. The Parties shall be only liable under the Memorandum for the proper performance of their obligations to the extent to which this Memorandum is legally binding in accordance with section 6. In the performance of this Memorandum, the Parties shall comply with the legislation of Georgia.*\n\n*5.2. In the event that, following the signing of this Memorandum, any amendments have been made to the legislation of Georgia, making the position of Inter RAO or of any Inter RAO Group company in Georgia worse as compared to the position as of the date of signing of this Memorandum, the Government of Georgia shall compensate Inter RAO or the relevant Inter RAO Group company in Georgia for all losses caused by such a change in the legislation, including by means of an increase of the Consumer Tariff of Telasi, JSC in accordance with section 2.2.2.*\n\n241.\n\nThe 2013 Memorandum attaches two appendices. Appendix 2 sets out \"Indicative Performance Indicators of Telasi JSC\" (\"**Appendix 2**\"), which set out forecast TIA and RGR Deficits for 2013 - 2025.203\n\n2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028.\n\n**3. Implementation of the 2013 Memorandum: NERC Resolution No. 3**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nIn furtherance of its obligations under Clauses 1.4 and 1.5 of the 2013 Memorandum, on 2 April 2013, the Government sent the 2013 Memorandum to the NERC for its consideration. The NERC issued a resolution the next day, on 3 April 2013, establishing Telasi's tariffs until 31 December 2025, including the reduction for household consumers, at identical rates to those set out in the 2013 Memorandum (\"**NERC Resolution No. 3**\").204 As the Khrami Companies' tariffs specified under the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum did not change in the 2013 Memorandum, NERC Resolutions No. 33 of 2008 and No. 5 of 2011 remained in force.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 3 on Amendments to NERC Resolution No. 33 dated 4 December 2008, dated 3 April 2013 (\"**NERC Resolution No. 3**\"), CL-0083; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 39:18-23.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants say that the NERC participated in the 2013 Memorandum by way of its immediate implementation of Telasi's Distribution Tariffs in Resolution No. 3, at precisely the tariff rates indicated in that agreement. According to them, this contradicts the Respondents' argument that the NERC is independent and that the Government is not responsible for the NERC's tariff setting decisions.205 In this regard, the Claimants also point to the NERC's prompt implementation of the tariffs in all previous memoranda between the Parties: the 2012 Temporary Memorandum through Resolution No. 23, the 2007 Memorandum through Resolution No. 33, and the 2011 Memorandum through Resolution No. 5.206\n\nNERC Resolution No. 3, CL-0083; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 34.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 33, CL-0078; NERC Resolution No. 5, CL-0080; NERC Resolution No. 23, CL-0082.\n\n**4. Telasi's Consumer and Distribution Tariffs**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nClause 2.2.1 of the 2013 Memorandum temporarily reduced Telasi's Consumer Tariffs for 2013-2016 by 3.54 tetri/kWh (from 11.424 to 8.034 tetri/kWh VAT inclusive) and for another category of household consumers, by 4 tetri/kWh (from 13.56 to 10.56 tetri/kWh VAT inclusive), as highlighted in the following \"indicative limit\" tariffs included in Clause 2.2.1:207\n\n**Table 2. Indicative limit consumer tariffs of Telasi JSC (tetri / kWh excluding VAT)**\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Transmission-line voltage and the categories of consumers** | **Until December 31, 2012.** | **from April 01, 2013 to December 31, 2016** | **from January 01, 2017 to December 31, 2025.** |\n| 0.4 kV for Non-Household Customers category | 13.56 | 13.56 | 13.56 |\n| 0.4 kV / up to and including 101 kWh per month, in tetri/kWh for Population category | 11.424 | 8.034 | 11.424 |\n| 0.4 kV / from 101 kWh to 301 kWh per month, in tetri/kWh for Population category | 13.56 | 10.56 | 13.56 |\n| 0.4 kV / from 301 kWh per month, in tetri/kWh for Population category | 14.998 | 14.998 | 14.998 |\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 79(a); Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 129; 2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028, Clause 2.2.1, Table 2 (emphasis added). The figures in the tables in Clause 2.2.1 are \"VAT exclusive\".\n\n245.\n\nUnder Clause 2.2.1, Telasi's long-term Distribution Tariffs were left at the rates set out in the 2011 Memorandum, save for the temporary reduction for household consumers in 2013-2016 by 1.225 tetri/kWh (from 8.08 to 6.855 tetri/kWh without VAT):208\n\n**Table 1.

The Claimants note that the only evidence the Respondents have adduced in support of their position that Clause 2.2.1 sets out indicative tariffs which could change at the NERC's prerogative is testimony from Mr. Bachiashvili.215 The Claimants say that Mr. Bachiashvili's evidence is contradicted by the 2013 Memorandum negotiation record.216 According to Mr. Mirsiyapov, Inter RAO included the words \"indicative limit\" tariff in a 15 December 2012 draft of the new agreement as a direct response to Georgia's attempt to introduce hard caps on tariffs in the 12 December 2012 draft.217 According to the Claimants, the term \"indicative\" was employed to reflect the fact that if the adjustment mechanisms in in the Memorandum were triggered, tariffs could rise higher than the \"indicative limits\".218 The Claimants point out that this logic is seen from the text of the 2013 Memorandum itself, which indicates at the end of Clause 2.2.1 that \"[t]hese indicative limit tariffs will be adjusted in accordance with the mechanisms provided in sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4\".219\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 53.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 54.\n\nMirsiyapov II, \u00b6 57. The Respondents' proposed language referred to \"Maximum\" distribution and consumer tariffs.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 55; Mirsiyapov II, \u00b6 57.\n\n2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028, Clause 2.2.1.\n\n**5. WAPT**\n-----------\n\n250.\n\nAs set out in Clauses 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, if Telasi's actual WAPT rises above 6.028 tetri/kWh in any year in 2013-2025, Telasi could request an increase to its Consumer Tariffs, calculated annually. As will be discussed in the Merits section, the Parties' positions diverge as to how this mechanism functions. The Claimants' view is that Telasi was automatically eligible for an increase when the 6.028 threshold was exceeded. For the Respondents, the adjustment was only possible when the 6.028 threshold was met *and* only to the extent necessary to ensure Telasi's Gross Revenue (\"**GR**\") matched the levels set out in Appendix 2 of the 2013 Memorandum.\n\n**6. Currency Exchange Rate and Inflation Changes**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nClause 2.3.4 provides for adjustment of Telasi's Distribution Tariffs for inflation and currency exchange rate changes. It is identical to the 2011 Memorandum, with one added sentence at the end:\n\n*This adjustment and its size will be determined [Claimants: in consultation with/ Respondents: with the approval of] the [MOE].*220\n\n2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028. The Parties dispute the translation of Clause 2.3.4. Claimants' translation reads: \"in consultation with\"; Respondents' translation reads: \"with the approval of\".\n\n252.\n\nThe Parties' positions diverge as to whether Telasi is entitled to WAPT and inflation and currency-based adjustments for the 2013-2016 tariff freeze. The Respondents argue that Clause 2.2.3, which provides that Telasi's Consumer Tariff \"shall not be revised subject to the compliance with the requirements of sections 2.1.2, 2.2.2 and 5.2 hereof\" prevents any adjustment. On the other hand, the Claimants say that the adjustment mechanisms in Clauses 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 are separate from Clause 2.2 and must be conducted separately from any revision of tariffs related to the Required Gross Revenue (\"**RGR**\"). They also say that Clauses 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 refer to adjustments for WAPT and inflation and currency changes in the full period from 2013-2025.\n\n**7. Required Gross Revenue**\n-----------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe 2013 Memorandum introduced the concept of RGR, defined at Appendix 1 as follows:\n\n*The amount of gross revenue required to cover the following costs: Infrastructural costs, Conditionally fixed costs, Agreed Investments, Interest on Loans, Income Tax, Reserve Revenue, compensation for negative changes in the legislation of Georgia in accordance with section 5.2.*221\n\n2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028, Appendix 1.\n\n254.\n\nAppendix 1 defines the other key terms in the definition as follows:\n\n***Agreed investments**: The amount of investments (excluding investments in new connections) in the amount of depreciation expenses for the reporting period and additional investments in the amount and composition as agreed with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia.*\n\n***Conditionally fixed costs of Telasi JSC**: In 2013: 71.1 mln. lari, including property tax; In 2014: 67.7 mln. lari, including property tax; In 2015: 65.3 mln.m lari, including property tax.*222\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n255.\n\nAs set out at Clause 2.2.2, the RGR was meant \"to ensure breakeven operations of Telasi\".223 The parties agreed on \"indicative limit\" tariffs and a mechanism for adjusting Telasi's Consumer Tariff to ensure Telasi recovered the RGR each year in the period from 2013 to 2025.\n\n*Id.*, Clause 2.2.2.\n\n**8. Reserve Revenue**\n----------------------\n\n256.\n\nReserve Revenue (\"**RR**\") is defined at Appendix 1 as:\n\n*In the period from 2013 to 2016, the value is calculated as 4% of the difference between Revenue and Commercial Losses, and is included in the actual Required Gross Revenue without any changes.*\n\n*In the period from 2017 to 2025, the value is calculated as 5% of the difference between Revenue and Commercial Losses, and is included in the actual Required Gross Revenue without any changes.*\n\n*The amount of funds used by Telasi JSC as a source of principal debt repayment, losses settlements in respect of write-offs and / or unclaimed accounts receivable and investments that have not been approved by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia.*224\n\n*Id.*, Appendix 1.\n\n257.\n\nAccordingly, from 2013-2016, the RR was fixed at 4% and for 2017-2025, it was 5%. It could be used to cover costs not included in the RGR, and could otherwise be retained by Telasi.\n\n**9. Yearly Calculations Yielding Target Investment Allowance or Gross Revenue Deficit**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe \"Target Investment Allowance\" (\"**TIA**\") is defined at Appendix 1 as:\n\n*The amount of funds consisting of the difference between the actual values of the Gross revenue for the reporting period and the Required Gross Revenue for the period. If the value is negative, TIA is recognized to be equal to 0.*225\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n259.\n\nAs set out above, Clause 2.1.7 requires Telasi to engage an independent auditor to calculate the actual RGR and compare it to Telasi's actual GR. GR is defined at Appendix 1 as:\n\n*The amount of revenue net of new connections, commercial losses and the Cost of Purchase of Electricity\u2026*226\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n260.\n\nPursuant to Clause 2.1.8, if the value of the difference between the actual RGR and the actual GR is positive, it forms the TIA. If the difference is negative, it forms the Gross Revenue Deficit (\"**GRD**\"), meaning that Inter RAO did not receive enough revenue to cover its RGR (including its RR).\n\n261.\n\nClause 2.1.10 provides that the TIA, if any, must be shared equally between Telasi and the MOE. However, if there is a GRD, Clause 2.1.12 entitles Telasi to an increase in its Consumer Tariff for the subsequent reporting period by the operation of Clause 2.2.2, postponed until 2017 pursuant to Clause 2.2.3.\n\n**10. The Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nClause 2.4 sets out the agreed long-term tariffs agreed to for the Khrami Companies from 31 December 2013 to 31 December 2025. These are identical to those set out in Clause 2.4.1 of the 2011 Memorandum and Clause 1 of Appendix 1 of the Khrami SPA. It also sets out the same adjustment mechanism for foreign exchange fluctuations as in the 2011 Memorandum and Appendix 1 of the Khrami SPA.\n\n**11. Appendix 2**\n------------------\n\n263.\n\nAppendix 2 to the 2013 Memorandum sets out for each year between 2013-2025 forecasted figures for the RGR, GR, GRD and TIA (VAT excluded), as follows:227\n\nAppendix No 2. Indicative performance indicators of Telasi JSC.

The Respondents say that Appendix 2 sets out the Parties' expectations of a 4 or 5% profit represented by the RR and is the benchmark against which achievement of Telasi's GR and RGR is measured.\n\n**12. Compensation for Amendments to Georgian Legislation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nAs set out above, Clause 5.2 provides for compensation for amendments to Georgian legislation which made Inter RAO's or Telasi's position worse as compared to the position under the Memorandum. The Parties differ on whether Clause 5.2 has been triggered. The Respondents' position is that the Claimants are not entitled to compensation under Clause 5.2 because Telasi is not financially worse off compared to its expectations at the date of signature of the 2013 Memorandum, since Telasi's Gross Revenue each year was not below what is set out in Appendix 2 to the 2013 Memorandum. The Claimants view Clause 5.2 as a stabilisation clause and an indemnity.228 The Claimants point out that Clause 5.2 does not mention Appendix 2 in any way. They contest the Respondents' argument that the numbers in Appendix 2 represent Inter RAO's profit expectations, and that the indemnity is only triggered when Telasi is worse off compared to those numbers.229 The Claimants say that their primary concern was the maintenance of the Distribution Margin, which could lead to greater profits if volumes of electricity sales increased.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 39:11-17.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 110.\n\n**13. Investment Commitments**\n------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nClause 2.6 did not maintain the obligation on Inter RAO to construct a HPP Chain contained in the 2007 and 2011 Memoranda. These were replaced by the requirement that Telasi buy 15% of its annual electricity requirements from renewable sources and/or HPPs commissioned after 31 March 2011. Unlike in the previous Memoranda, Clause 2.6.3 provided that the additional cost involved is taken into account in calculating Telasi's WAPT.\n\n**N. The 2014 Methodology for Setting Electricity Tariffs**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nBy 2012, Georgia's electricity network had been substantially improved. In parallel with the Parties' negotiations concerning the 2013 Memorandum, the NERC commenced the process of updating its tariff regime to bring it in line with the best practices of the EU, pursuant to funding provided by the European Commission (\"**EC**\") under the \"**Twinning Initiative**\" for inter-EU knowledge sharing and administrative reform.230 The tariff review process included consultations between the NERC and electricity companies, including Telasi, and culminated in the adoption of a new tariff setting methodology (the \"**2014 Methodology**\") on 30 July 2014.231 The steps leading to the adoption of the 2014 Methodology included the following:\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 102; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 159; Milorava I, \u00b6 26; Tr. Day 1 (Respondents' Opening Statement), 178-179, 239-240.\n\n2014 Methodology, CL-0084.\n\n268.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, it was publicly announced that the Government, the NERC, and others would harmonize Georgia's regulatory framework in line with EU energy legislation, including a move to an incentive-based electricity tariff methodology.232 The Respondents acknowledge that at this early stage of the process, the outcome of the project was not known, but that \"[t]he idea was to modernise the Georgian regime, and that's what happened over time with the adoption of the 2014 [M]ethodology\".233\n\nEC Press Release, 26 October 2012, R-0030; Chalagashvili speech at Twinning Initiative conference, 26 October 2012, R-0031; Shonia speech at Twinning Initiative conference, 26 October 2012, R-0033.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Respondents' Opening Statement), 178-179, 239-240.\n\n269.\n\nIt appears that there was some discussion of the Twinning Initiative and the NERC's plan to revise its tariff setting methodology during the negotiations of the 2013 Memorandum.234\n\nTr. Day 3 (Cross examination of Mr. Mirsiyapov), 111, 115-117. 1. Inter RAO understood that there could be changes to the tariff setting methodology, which gave rise to its proposal to include the NERC as a party to the 2013 Memorandum and Clause 5.2. *See also*, Tr. Day 7 (Respondents' Closing Statement), 129-130.\n\n270.\n\nOn 19 December 2013, the NERC hosted a discussion between the Twinning Initiative leaders from the NERC (Mr. Shonia), Austrian energy regulator E-Control (Mr. Preinstorfer), Telasi and the Khrami Companies and two other electricity companies to discuss the updating of the existing tariff methodology and integrating quality supply practices from other energy regulatory authorities.235\n\nSummary of Roundtable, 20 December 2013, R-0034, p. 2; EC Press Release, 24 December 2013, R-0035.\n\n271.\n\nOn 17 February 2014, the EC reported on the NERC's and the Twinning team's plan to issue a new methodology for the calculation of electricity tariffs to bring it in line with EU legislation and to create good climate investments it noted that the calculation method being proposed resulted from discussions of the December 2013 roundtable with Georgian market players.236\n\nEC Press Release \u2013 Plans for new calculation of electricity network tariffs for Georgia consumers, 17 February 2014, R-0036.\n\n272.\n\nBy the end of March 2014, Inter RAO and Telasi received a Russian translation of a draft of the 2014 Methodology.237\n\nEmail from Antadze to Balchugov with attachments, dated 31 March 2014, R-0084.\n\n273.\n\nOn 14 May 2014, at the Twinning Initiative's final conference, the NERC's Ms. Milorava explained the new tariff methodology was a result of international and EU best practices and stated that it remained open for public discussion with stakeholders.238\n\nMilorava speech Twinning Conference, dated 14 May 2014, R-0041, p. 2; EC Press Releases, dated 13 May 2014, R-0038, dated 14 May 2014, R-0040; Twinning Conference Agenda, R-0039.\n\n274.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, the NERC met with electricity companies, including Telasi (Mr. Antadze) and the Khrami Companies (Mr. Kandelaki).239 The NERC (Mr. Sanikidze) presented the general principles underpinning the 2014 Methodology.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 170; Milorava I, \u00b6 33.\n\n275.\n\nFinally, on 30 July 2014, the NERC adopted the 2014 Methodology at a public session attended by electricity companies, including Telasi (Mr. Antadze) and the NERC's Ms. Milorava and Mr. Sanikidze.240\n\n2014 Methodology, CL-0084; NERC Hearing No. 30 Minutes, R-0042, p. 1.\n\n276.\n\nThe 2014 Methodology provides for setting distribution and consumer tariffs yearly, based on voltage levels, capital and operational expenses and the WAPT. It applies the \"revenue cap\" method of regulation, in which the regulator calculates allowed revenues for a defined regulatory period in order to allow distribution companies to cover reasonable costs associated with their distribution activities and earn a reasonable return on their capital investment.241\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 175.\n\n277.\n\nThe 2014 Methodology sets and adjusts the distribution tariff based on the justified \"reasonable and fair\" distribution costs and then dividing them by the volume of distributed electricity. The Distribution Tariff derives from dividing the allowed revenues for distribution companies by their forecasted sales according to voltage levels over the required period.242 If the volume increases, then the Distribution Tariff, and in turn the Consumer Tariff, will decrease; and *vice versa*. It treats the cost of electricity as a pass-through cost recovered in full through the Consumer Tariff, whereas the 2013 Memorandum ties the adjustment of the WAPT to Gross Revenue, which is inherently sensitive to volumes. In other words, the 2014 Methodology takes volumes of electricity into account through the distribution tariff, whereas the 2013 Memorandum takes volumes into account through the consumer tariff.\n\nMoselle I, \u00b6 5.11(b).\n\n**1. The Relevant Provisions of the 2014 Methodology**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the 2014 Methodology provide as follows:\n\n*Article 3*\n\n*Main Principles*\n\n*1. This Methodology and the tariffs set on its bases*\n\n*a. protect consumers from the monopolistic prices;*\n\n*b. stimulate utility to increase its efficiency via optimization of its costs with the requirement not to decrease quality of service standards and technical conditions of the utility;*\n\n*c. support the increase of the utility's' returns by means of increased operational and management efficiency;*\n\n*d. support the stable and reliable functioning of the utility;*\n\n*e. ensure that tariffs are transparent, stable and fair for the utility;*\n\n*f. reflect the state policy with regard to discount tariffs, provided that none of the consumers categories shall receive a discount tariff subsidized by licensee, importer, market operator or any other category;*\n\n*g. reflect different costs between the different consumer categories;*\n\n*h. cover costs of the utility with funds received from each consumer category in proportion to costs incurred for servicing this consumer category.*\n\n...\n\n279.\n\nThe 2014 Methodology distinguishes between controllable operational expenses (\"**OPEX**\") and non-controllable OPEX, and incorporates efficiency incentives for controllable OPEX:243\n\n*4. For calculation controllable operational costs \"incentive regulation\" principle is used, which implies setting up incentives to optimize utility's costs. Controllable operational costs audit is carried out before regulatory period and costs changes are made during tariff regulatory period accordingly to this methodology.*\n\n*...*\n\n*Article 4*\n\n*Tariff regulatory and tariff setting period*\n\n*1. Based on this methodology tariff regulation period is determined individually for specific utilities.*\n\n*2. Commission sets tariff regulatory period for each year according to the terms and conditions of this methodology.*\n\n*3. The Commission sets for the whole tariff regulatory period the basic components of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and fixed rate for the efficiency factor (X-factor).*\n\n*4. Tariffs are set annually by the Commission during tariff regulatory period, and it is valid from 1 January to 31 December, except for the circumstances set forth in Paragraph 4 of Article 23 of this Methodology.*\n\n2014 Methodology, CL-0084, Arts. 3(4), 4; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 176: The Respondents say this OPEX distinction encouraged distribution companies to reduce their costs so as to increase their profits.\n\n280.\n\nDistribution companies' permitted revenues are calculated as the sum of OPEX, capital expenses (\"**CAPEX**\"), a normative allowance for electricity losses in the distribution network, and a correction factor:244\n\n*CHAPTER II*\n\n*CALCULATION OF THE REGULATORY COSTS*\n\n*Article 5*\n\n*Regulatory Cost Base for the Tariff Year*\n\n*Regulatory Cost Base for the tariff year is calculated according to the following formula:*\n\n***RCB**(t+1)= **CAPEX**(t+1) +**cOPEX**(t+1)+**ncOPEX**(t+1)+**CNL**(t+1)+**CORR**(t+1)**(1)***\n\n*where,*\n\n*RCB(t+1) - Regulatory Cost Base for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*CAPEX(t+1) - Capital Expenses for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*cOPEX(t+1) - Controllable Operational Expenses for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*ncOPEX(t+1) - Non-controllable Operational Expenses for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*CNL(t+1) - Cost of Normative Losses in distribution networks for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*CORR(t+1) - Cost correction factor, which provides the reflection of the difference between factual and planned costs of Tariff Year in the Regulatory Cost Base of the Tariff Year, and also received income from non-operational activity envisaged in the subparagraph \"e\" of paragraph 1 of Article 19 of this Methodology, based on the principles defined in this Methodology (GEL).*\n\n2014 Methodology, CL-0084, Art. 5; *see e.g.*, Moselle I, \u00b6 5.14.\n\n281.\n\nThe NERC determines CAPEX as the sum of the annual depreciation on fixed assets and a return on capital, which is calculated by multiplying the Regulated Asset Base (\"**RAB**\") in GEL by the rate of return on the RAB using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"**WACC**\") method:245\n\n*Article 6*\n\n*Capital Expenses*\n\n*Capital Expenses for the Tariff Year are calculated according to the following formula:*\n\n***CAPEX**(t+1)= **RAB**(t+1)\\* **WACC** + **D**(t+1)*\n\n*where,*\n\n*CAPEX(t+1) - Capital Expenses for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*RAB(t+1) - Regulated Assets Base for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*WACC - Rate of return on the RAB for the tariff regulatory period (%);*\n\n*D(t+1) - Annual depreciation for the tariff year (GEL).*\n\n*CHAPTER III*\n\n*TARIFF CALCULATION*\n\n*DISTRIBUTION, PASS THROUGH AND CONSUMPTION TARIFF CALCULATION*\n\n*Article 15*\n\n*Electricity Distribution and Pass through Tariffs*\n\n*1.

Electricity consumption tariff includes costs related to the electricity purchase and distribution.*\n\n*2. Electricity consumption tariff is set for each voltage level of the distribution network; it is based on principles of this Methodology and this article and is calculated according to the following formula:*\n\n*Ti Consum(t+1)= Pave(t+1)(11)*\n\n*where,*\n\n*Ti Consum(t+1) - Electricity consumption tariff for i-voltage level of the distribution network for the tariff year (tetri/kWh);*\n\n*Ti distrib - Electricity distribution tariff for i-voltage level of the distribution network for the tariff year (tetri/kWh);*\n\n*Pave(t+1) - forecasted weighted average price of the electricity to be purchased in the tariff year by distribution licensee, which includes all costs of purchasing according to the legislation (tetri/kWh);*\n\n*i - Corresponding voltage level of the electricity distribution network.*\n\n*Article 17*\n\n*Amount of Electricity and Weighted Average Price of Purchase*\n\n*1. While calculating the tariffs the Commission utilizes the actual amounts of purchased and distributed electricity during the test year, considering the consumption dynamics in the sector and/or the Electricity (Capacity) forecasted balance approved for Tariff Year during tariff calculation year.*\n\n*2. The utility is obliged to submit the possible amount and price of the electricity to be purchased from particular sources according to paragraph 1 of this article, for the purpose of determining weighted average price of the electricity to be purchased in the tariff year by distribution licensee; also other forecasted costs related to electricity purchase, such as transmission, dispatch service and purchasing the guaranteed capacity. Based on submitted information the Commission sets Weighted Average Price for Purchased Electricity by the utility.*\n\n*3. Based on submitted information the Commission sets Weighted Average Price for Purchased Electricity by the utility for tariff year according to the following formula:*\n\n*Paver(t+1)= COSTE(t+1)+COSTGC(t+1)+COSTT(t+1)+COSTD(t+1)+CORREl.(t+1)\\*  100(12)*\n\n*E Receiv.(t+1)*\n\n*Where,*\n\n*P aver(t+1) - Weighted Average Price for electricity to be purchased for tariff year by the utility (tetri/kWh);*\n\n*COSTE(t+1) - Total forecasted cost of electricity to be purchased by the utility for the tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*COSTGC(t+1) - Total forecasted cost of guaranteed capacity fee for tariff year (GEL);*\n\n*COSTT(t+1) - Total forecasted cost of transmission service provided by transmission licensees (GEL);*\n\n*COSTD(t+1) - Total forecasted cost of dispatch service provided by dispatch licensee (GEL); CORR El.(t+1) - Electricity Purchase Correction Factor, which ensures the reflection of the difference between planned and actual costs related to the Electricity purchase for Tariff Year;*\n\n*E Receiv. (t+1) - Forecasted amount of electricity received (metered) on the delivery points of the utility for the tariff year (kWh).*\n\n*...*\n\n*Article 20*\n\n*Correction of Capital Costs*\n\n*1. If factual value of investment made by the utility differs from the planned investment value, then the tariff correction is carried out according to the Paragraph 2 of this Article, taking into consideration the principles described in the Article 7 of this methodology.*\n\n*2. Correction of Capital Costs for the difference received from the investment amount is calculated according to the following formula:*\n\n***cRRAB(t+1) = [(aRAB(t+1) - pRAB(t+1) x WACC(t+1)] x (1+ WACC(t+1) x (1 + WACCt)(14),***\n\n*Where:*\n\n*cRRAB(t+1) - Corrected cost or the return for (t+1) period (GEL);*\n\n*aRAB(t\u20131) - Factual cost of RAB for (t-1) period (GEL);*\n\n*pRAB(t\u20131) - Planned cost of RAB for (t-1) period (GEL);*\n\n*WACC - Rate of time value of money, which is equal to WACC (%).*\n\n***cD(t+1) = aD(t+1) x (1+ WACC(t+1) x (1 + WACC t) (15),***\n\n*cD(t+1) - Corrected cost of Annual depreciation for t+1) period (GEL);*\n\n*aD(t\u20131) - Factual cost of Annual depreciation for (t-1) period (GEL);*\n\n*pD(t\u20131) - Planned cost of Annual depreciation for (t-1) period (GEL);*\n\n*WACC - Rate of time value of money, which is equal to WACC (%).*\n\n*...*\n\n*Article 23*\n\n*Correction of Weighted Average Price of Electricity Purchase*\n\n*1. If factual weighted average price of purchased electricity differs from the planned price in the tariff year, the Commission shall make correction of Electricity Consumption Tariff for the next tariff year by the difference of factual and planned price of electricity purchase using the principle of the time value of money envisaged in this Methodology.*\n\n*2. The Correction of Weighted Average Price of Electricity Purchase is based on the following factors:*\n\n*a. amount and cost of purchased electricity;*\n\n*b. cost of purchased guaranteed capacity, electricity transmission and dispatch service.*\n\n*3. The Correction of Weighted Average Price of Electricity Purchase is made in case the change between factual and planned data is not due to the utility.*\n\n*4. The Commission is authorized to make correction of Electricity Consumption Tariff which was calculated based on this Methodology and set for the Tariff year by Weighted Average Price of Electricity Purchase only once in this Tariff Year.*\n\n*CHAPTER V*\n\n*TARIFF SETTING AND APPLICATION SUBMISSION PROCEDURES*\n\n*Article 24*\n\n*Accounting and Reporting*\n\n*1.

The Tribunal assesses the Parties' arguments in this regard under the Merits section, below.\n\n**O. 2014: The Non-Adjustment of Telasi's Tariffs for alleged WAPT-Based Losses**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nFrom September 2014 until 27 December 2017, Telasi applied for increases to its Consumer Tariffs pursuant to the 2013 Memorandum. The following summarises the chronology of the principal relevant exchanges between Inter RAO and the MOE and the NERC during this period.\n\n285.\n\nOn 12 and 18 September 2014, Inter RAO and Telasi lodged their first complaint with the MOE that Telasi's WAPT during 2013-2014 energy year (September 2013-August 2014) was above the maximum threshold of 6.028 tetri/kWh set out in Clause 2.3.1 of the 2013 Memorandum.248 Due to the alleged resulting revenue shortfall of GEL 1.4 million caused by its energy purchase costs, Telasi asked the MOE to order the NERC to set its Consumer Tariffs in accordance with the 2013 Memorandum, or develop a compensation mechanism.249 Telasi also asked for compensation for losses relating to connecting new customers.250\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 18 September 2014, C-0044. The 2013-2014 energy year ran from 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2014.\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Kaladze, dated 12 September 2014, C-0042; Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 18 September 2014, C-0044.\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Kaladze, dated 12 September 2014, C-0043.\n\n286.\n\nOn 25 September 2014, Minister Kaladze, Inter RAO and Telasi met to discuss Telasi's request. On the same date, Inter RAO learned that Telasi's WAPT for September 2014 (2014-2015 energy year) was 7.56 tetri/kWh, and notified Minister Kaladze, reminding him of their earlier agreement on compensating Telasi's WAPT-based loss.251 The Claimants say that to compensate Telasi for its GEL 1.4 million loss in the 2013-2014 energy year, Minister Kaladze agreed to decrease Telasi's WAPT for the September-December 2014 period.252\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 23 October 2014, C-0046; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42.\n\nMarkov I, \u00b6 42; *see* mention of this agreement in Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 23 October 2014, C-0046; *see also*, Inter RAO's note on negotiating position, dated 26 May 2015, C-0059. The Claimants say that the Parties were aware that this commercial resolution was not what was contemplated by the terms of the WAPT-based adjustment at Clause 2.3.2 of the 2013 Memorandum. Nevertheless, because Inter RAO and Telasi were aware that it would be politically difficult for the Government to justify an increase to Consumer Tariffs, the parties were willing to entertain alternative means of compensation: Claimants' Memorial, fn 216.\n\n287.\n\nMinister Kaladze asked Deputy Minister of Energy, Ms. Valishvili, to consider the issues raised by Inter RAO and Telasi's letters regarding the WAPT.253 Ms. Valishvili says that in order to assess whether Telasi was entitled to a WAPT-based adjustment under Clause 2.3.2 or offer another form of compensation, the MOE had to assess the impact of the increase in Telasi's WAPT beyond the 6.028 tetri/kWh threshold in light of Telasi's overall financial performance as reflected in its independently audited reports.254 Given that the audit report for the 2013-2014 energy year would not become available until the second quarter of 2015, Ms. Valishvili says that she could not have determined whether Telasi was entitled to compensation for its actual WAPT exceeding the maximum WAPT of 6.028 tetri/kWh before that time. Ms. Valishvili considered that it would be more expedient to ensure that Telasi's WAPT in the September-December 2014 period would be such as to offset any excess WAPT during the 2013-2014 energy year. She says that this could be achieved by ensuring that Telasi would receive cheaper energy available on the market.255 She shared this assessment with Minister Kaladze, who then discussed it with Inter RAO's Chairman, Mr. Kovalchuk, at the 25 September 2014 meeting.256 Minister Kaladze informed Ms. Valishvili that Inter RAO was agreeable to this proposal.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 38; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 179.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 39.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 40.\n\n288.\n\nOn 23 October 2014, Inter RAO wrote to Minister Kaladze, requesting information about the measures that he had taken to ensure that Telasi's WAPT would be lower going forward.257 At a meeting on 24 October 2014, Ms. Valishvili met with representatives of Inter RAO and Telasi to discuss the evolution of Telasi's WAPT. Ms. Valishvili says she reiterated that the MOE would try to ensure that Telasi's WAPT would be lower going forward so as to offset a deficit. She noted that Telasi had made savings on its WAPT prior to August 2013 (the 2012-2013 energy year), and that this should also be taken into account in assessing whether Telasi's overall average WAPT remained below the 6.028 tetri/kWh threshold.258 The MOE therefore took the position that Georgia had no obligation to compensate Telasi for the WAPT-based losses in the 2013-2014 energy year, because it had previously earned a profit that should be offset against these losses.259 Inter RAO's position was that the previous energy year was irrelevant to any assessment of Telasi's WAPT going forward.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 23 October 2014, C-0046.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 42.\n\nReport on meeting with MOE re 2013 Memorandum performance, dated 24 October 2014, C-0047; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n289.\n\nOn 28 October 2014, Inter RAO wrote to Minister Kaladze (who had not attended the 24 October meeting), requesting a meeting and advising him of the position taken by the MOE.260 On 7 November 2014, Inter RAO met directly with Minister Kaladze, and, according to the Claimants, their discussion proceeded as follows:\n\n\u2022 Minister Kaladze agreed to compensate the GEL 1.4 million shortfall by 31 August 2015 (rather than by the end of 2014, as previously agreed). Ms. Valishvili says Minister Kaladze explained to Inter RAO that, given the high price of electricity in the October-December 2014 period, it was difficult to adjust Telasi's WAPT to ensure break-even results by the end of 2014, but agreed to try to do so by the end of the 2014-2015 energy year (31 August 2015).261\n\n\u2022 Telasi agreed to inform the MOE of its monthly actual WAPT until 2016, and the corresponding compensation it received through the NERC's reduction of its WAPT.262\n\n\u2022 Inter RAO repeated that its WAPT for the 2014-2015 energy year (September to November 2014) was already above the 6.028 tetri/kWh threshold.\n\n\u2022 The parties agreed that the cost of connecting new customers to Telasi's network would be \"break-even\" until a plan was developed by 5 December 2014.263\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 28 October 2014, C-0048.\n\n*Ibid*.; Valishvili I, \u00b6 43.\n\n*See e.g.* Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 23 October 2014, C-0046; Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 11 November 2014, C-0049; Letter from Kobtsev (Telasi) to Kaladze (MOE), dated 1 December 2014, C-0050; Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 10 December 2014, C-0051.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, 11 November 2014, C-0049; Markov I, \u00b6 44.\n\n290.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, the MOE, Inter RAO and Telasi met to discuss the alleged losses in connecting new customers and the depreciation of the GEL in 2014.264\n\nReport on meeting at MOE on compensation for losses from new connections, 11 December 2014, C-0052; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\n291.\n\nThe Parties' discussions continued throughout 2015, with no resolution.265\n\n*See e.g.*, Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 23 April 2015, C-0058; Inter RAO note on negotiating position, 26 May 2015, C-0059; Markov I, \u00b6 50.\n\n292.\n\nOn 27 May 2015, Telasi's audited financial statements for 2014 were approved at Telasi's General Meeting of Shareholders and Telasi resolved to distribute GEL 8.8 million in dividends to its shareholders.266\n\nMinutes of Telasi's Annual General Meeting, 27 May 2015, C-0060.\n\n**1. The 2015 Tariff Review Process**\n-------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nBy July 2015, the Claimants say Telasi was experiencing financial difficulties due to its increasing WAPT, and an \"expected across-the-board increase to generation tariffs in Georgia, which would further increase Telasi's WAPT-based losses\". On 14 July 2015, Telasi asked the NERC to adjust its Consumer Tariffs to reflect the projected increased cost of purchasing electricity, warning that the absence of a \"compensatory mechanism\" would lead to Telasi's bankruptcy.267 Telasi's request read as follows:\n\nMs. Milorava,\n\nIn view of the projected increase in the electricity generation tariffs of thermal power plants in 2015, as well as the already existing increase in the value of the electricity transmission service, the financial standing of JSC Telasi will become extremely complicated which will, unfortunately, inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of the company in the absence of a compensatory mechanism. Moreover, this situation will have a materially adverse impact on all the participants of the Georgian energy sector from whom JSC Telasi purchases services and electricity (capacity).\n\nIn order to stabilize the functioning of the company, we hereby request that you take into account the increase in the expenses to be borne to purchase electricity, as well as the increase m the transmission service tariffs, and that you correct the consumer (end-user) tariffs m respect of electricity purchase. We kindly ask you to provide compensation from the date when the value of the said components of the expenses of JSC Telasi increased.\n\nMoreover, please be advised that the company does not consider the increase of its own operating expenses (which are mcluded m the electricity distribution tariff).\n\nRespectfully,\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103; Letter from Kobtsev to Milorava, dated 14 July 2015, C-0061.\n\n294.\n\nThe next day, the NERC replied that it could not adjust Telasi's Consumer Tariffs.268 It confirmed that Article 23 of the 2014 Methodology allowed for the adjustment of the WAPT of Telasi's electricity, but noted that it could not adjust Telasi's WAPT pursuant to that provision without having first calculated Telasi's tariffs in accordance with the 2014 Methodology (since Telasi's tariffs at that time were still those set pursuant to the 2013 Memorandum and NERC Resolution No. 3). The NERC stated that the only way it could make such an adjustment was if Telasi submitted a formal adjustment application in accordance with the 2014 Methodology, which would require it to ask the NERC to first set its tariffs according to the 2014 Methodology. Until Telasi brought itself within the 2014 Methodology framework, the NERC's position was that it \"lack[ed] legal grounds\" to review and adjust Telasi's Consumer Tariff because its authority to adjust such tariffs derived exclusively from the 2014 Methodology.269 The NERC's letter records as follows:270\n\nIn response to your letter #0714/351 of 14 July 2015, we hereby clarify the following:\n\nArticle 23 of the Methodology for Calculating the Tariffs for the Distribution, Pass-Through and Consumption of Electricity, approved by Decree No. 14 of the Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission, dated 30 July 2014, allows for the adjustment of the weighted average purchase pnce of electncity. However, pursuant to Clause 4 of the same article, the said adjustment only pertains to the electncity consumption tanff which was calculated and established on the basis of the same Methodology.\n\nDue to the fact that JSC Telasi has not submitted a relevant tariff apphcation and the Commission has not set the electncity distribution, pass-through and consumption tanffs for JSC Telasi after the Methodology for Calculating the Tanffs for the Distnbution, Pass-Through and Consumption of Electncity, approved by Decree No. 14 of the Commission, dated 30 July 2014, came into effect, the Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission lacks any legal grounds to renew and adjust the consumption tanff only in respect of electncity purchase.\n\nThus, the electncity distnbution, pass-through and consumption tanffs will be set m the event that JSC Telasi submits a complete tanff apphcation and relevant documentation (both as hard copies and m electronic form) in the form approved by Resolution No. 29/1 of the Commission, dated 7 August 2014. Moreover, each page of the tariff apphcation submitted as a hard copy shall be signed by the person authorized to represent the company.\n\nLetter from Milorava to Kobtsev, dated 15 July 2015, C-0062.\n\nLetter from Milorava to Kobtsev, dated 15 July 2015, C-0062.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n295.\n\nOn 21 July 2015, the MOE and Inter RAO met to discuss the NERC's response to Telasi's request for a WAPT-based adjustment to its Consumer Tariffs. The Claimants say that Minister Kaladze confirmed that Telasi's rights under the 2013 Memorandum would not be affected if it filed a tariff application under the 2014 Methodology.271 The same day, Telasi wrote to Minister Kaladze to confirm its understanding that the application of the 2013 Memorandum would not be cancelled if it filed the tariff application under the 2014 Methodology, and noted that the NERC's recent increase to generation tariffs in Georgia would increase Telasi's WAPT for the 2014-2015 energy year by 2.8% and in the 2015-2016 energy year by 49.5%.272 Telasi also reiterated that it had GEL 1.4 million in WAPT-based losses in the 2013-2014 energy year, and GEL 4.2 million so far in the 2014-2015 energy year (September-July 2014). Telasi's letter to Minister Kaladze read as follows:273\n\n*Mr. Kaladze,*\n\n*Since 20 June 2007, cooperation between the Government of Georgia and INTER RAO (and Group companies) was based on the Memorandum on the Development of Cooperation in the Electric Power Sector and the Implementation of Previous Agreements. The Memoranda successively superseded one another, while the continuity (succession) of mutual obligations was preserved. At present, the fourth Memorandum executed on 31 March 2013 is in force.*\n\n*As per Clause 2.3.1. of the said Memorandum, the annual electricity purchase portfolio of Telasi under direct contracts with generating companies and ESCO (Electricity Market Operator) shall be formed with the Average Weighted Tariff not exceeding 6.028 tetri/kWh. Moreover, as per Appendix 1 to the Memorandum, in addition to the electricity cost under the contracts, the Average Weighted Purchase Tariff shall include the \"components of import, reserve, loss in the electricity system (except for the networks of Telasi JSC), transmission costs, transit, dispatch.\"*\n\n*To the best of our knowledge, in July 2015, GNERC adopted a resolution on the increase of electricity tariffs for heat generators as of 01 September 2015 (on or around 22 July 2015). As of 01 April 2015, the tariff for electricity transmission through the networks of Georgian State Electrosystem has been already increased by 0.28 tetri/kWh. The cost of electricity purchase from the Commercial Operator has increased as well.*\n\n*These resolutions will definitely result in the increase of the threshold level of the Average Weighted Tariff in 2014-2015 and 2015- 2016 energy years by 2.8% and 49.5% respectively. Thus, the Georgian counterparty will be in material breach of Clause 2.3.1. of the Memorandum.*\n\n*As per Clause 2.3.2 of the Memorandum, in the event that the Average Weighted Purchase Tariff of electricity exceeds the threshold level (6.028 tetri/kWh), the Consumer Tariff shall be increased simultaneously.*\n\n*It is hereby requested that you adopt a resolution on the increase of the Consumer Tariff as per the Memorandum of 31 March 2015 [sic] at the same time as adopting the resolutions on the increase of the cost of components of the Average Weighted Purchase Tariff of Telasi.*\n\n*Moreover, we draw your attention to the following:*\n\n*1. In 2013- 2014 energy year, the threshold level of the Average Weighted Tariff was exceeded and amounted to 6.091 tetri/kWh. This resulted in additional expenses for Telasi in the amount of GEL 1.408 million which is also subject to compensation as per the Memorandum of 31 March 2015 [sic].*\n\n*2. In 2014- 2015 energy year, the threshold level of the Average Weighted Tariff for 10 months amounted to 6.23 tetri/kWh. This resulted in additional expenses for Telasi in the amount of GEL 4.2 million which is also subject to compensation as per the Memorandum of 31 March 2015 [sic].*\n\n*In addition, please be advised that Telasi is not planning to increase its own operating expenses which will remain at the level of Conditionally Fixed Costs envisaged in the Memorandum of 31 March 2015 [sic].*\n\n*Telasi referred this matter to GNERC by letter No. 0714/351 of 14 July 2015 in response to which we received letter No. l/03-6/795-4554 of 15 July 2015. Based on the response of GNCERC, in order for the matter of the increase of the Consumer Tariff of Telasi to be considered, it is necessary for Telasi to submit a tariff application In this connection, please confirm that the submission of the application to GNERC by us does not cancel the application of the Memorandum of 3l March 2013 executed between the Government of Georgia, INTER RAO and the Group companies.*\n\nMarkov I, \u00b6 54; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 105.\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Kaladze, dated 21 July 2015, C-0063.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n296.\n\nOn the same day, Minister Kaladze replied that Telasi's application would not affect its rights under the 2013 Memorandum:274\n\nTo the Director General of Telasi JSC,\n\nS.

Telasi stated that while its vision and that of the NERC coincided on most issues, it went on to raise a number of issues and recalled that it had outstanding claims for reimbursements related to the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 energy years. It also raised the issue of the expected increase in energy procurement costs due to the increase in tariffs from generating companies. Telasi also drew to the NERC's attention the requirement that under the 2013 Memorandum its tariff decisions must not worsen the economic standing of Telasi.278\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6 39.\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Milorava, dated 26 August 2015, R-0044.\n\n299.\n\nOn 27 August 2015, the NERC held a public hearing to discuss the approval of Telasi's investment plan for the 2015-2016 energy year in advance of issuing preliminary calculations of Telasi's Consumer and Distribution Tariffs.279 Telasi's Deputy Commercial Director, Mr. Misha Antadze, and other Telasi representatives attended this meeting*.*280 At the meeting the NERC discussed Telasi's investment plan for 2015-2016 submitted with its tariff application and adopted certain decisions regarding the adoption of the plan and how investment projects would be handled in setting Telasi's tariffs.\n\nNERC Hearing No. 49 Minutes, dated 27 August 2015, R-0045.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 1.\n\n**2. September 2015 NERC Resolution No. 26: First Application of the 2014 Methodology to Telasi's Consumer and Distribution Tariffs**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nOn 3 September 2015, the NERC established Telasi's new Consumer and Distribution Tariffs pursuant to the 2014 Methodology, as opposed to the 2013 Memorandum (\"**NERC Resolution No. 26**\").281 The Resolution was issued at a public hearing convened by the NERC, at which its decision and calculations were explained. The hearing was attended by Telasi's Mr. Antadze and several other representatives from Telasi. While Mr. Antadze raised some questions and some disagreements with the NERC's calculations, there is no record that Telasi complains about the application of the 2014 Methodology.282\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26 on Amendments to NERC Resolution No. 33 dated 4 December 2008, dated 3 September 2015 (\"**NERC Resolution No. 26**\"), CL-0085; NERC Hearing No. 51 minutes, dated 3 September 2015*,* R-0046. The Head of the NERC's Tariffs and Economic Analysis Department, Mr. Sanikidze presented the tariff review process and of the NERC's calculation of the different cost components of Telasi's Consumer and Distribution tariffs (pp. 4-51).\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26, CL-0085; NERC Hearing No. 51 minutes, dated 3 September 2015, R-0046, pp. 56-60.\n\n301.\n\nThe new tariffs included a 30% increase to Telasi's Consumer Tariffs, as follows:283\n\nRespondents' Opening Presentation, slide 115; Tr. Day 1, 258-259.\n\n302.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26 increased Telasi's WAPT, while decreasing its Distribution Tariffs, which resulted in an overall 30% increase in Telasi's Consumer Tariffs.284 The Claimants say that the 30% increase to Telasi's Consumer Tariffs was not sufficient to compensate Telasi for its increasing WAPT because it resulted in the Distribution Tariffs being lower than the rates fixed by the 2013 Memorandum.285 Although the issue was not raised at the time, the Respondents now say that under the terms of the 2013 Memorandum, Telasi was not entitled to a tariff adjustment due to the tariff freeze in Clause 2.2.3. However, in view of the conditions described in Telasi's letter of 14 July 2015, referring to the possible bankruptcy of the company, the NERC had granted a tariff revision under the 2014 Methodology, which they say was properly applied. The Respondents say that the Claimants were happy with the tariff adjustment and only complained sometime later.286 The Respondents note that in Inter RAO's 2015 Annual Report, Telasi reported a 42% increase in revenues \"due to growth in electricity sales by increasing the level of consumption and the increase of sales tariffs\" as of September 2015.287 According to the Respondents, from March 2013 to December 2015, Telasi had accumulated a Target Investment Allowance of GEL 54.3 million, GEL 23.3 million of which was generated in 2015 alone despite an expected GRD of GEL 10.74 million.288\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26, CL-0085; Milorava I, \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 108; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\nTr.

Rather, they complained on various occasions and emphasized the need to set Telasi's tariffs in accordance with the 2013 Memorandum.289\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 73 and the sources cited there.\n\n304.\n\nThe following table provided by the Claimants shows the difference between what were the Distribution Tariffs prescribed under the 2013 Memorandum and NERC Resolution No. 3 *versus* those which the NERC fixed pursuant to the 2014 Methodology and Resolution No. 26:290\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Voltage** | **Distribution Tariffs (tetri/kWh)** |\n|  | **Resolution No 3 of 2013, Art 8 [CL-083]** | **Resolution No 26 of 2015, Art 8 [CL-085]** |\n| **220/380 V (commercial consumers)** | 8.08 |  |\n| **220/380 V (household consumers)** | 6.855 | 5.567 |\n| **6-10 kV** | 7.138 | 1.773 |\n| **35-110 kV** | 1.8 | 0.705 |\n\nClaimants' Opening Presentation, Demonstrative No. 6; Tr.

The Respondents accept that the Distribution Tariffs was decreased but that the significant, unexpected increase in sales revenue compared to the volumes forecast at the time the of the 2013 Memorandum increased Telasi's Gross Revenue: Tr. Day 1, 258-259.\n\n305.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26 also adjusted Telasi's Consumer Tariffs as follows:\n\n*Article 10. Limiting tariffs for the purchase of electricity by consumers of Telasi JSC:*\n\n*1. Limiting tariffs for the purchase of electricity by consumers of Telasi JSC by voltage steps:*\n\n*a) 220/380 V (non-domestic consumers) - 16.740 tetri/kWh;*\n\n*b) 3.3-6-10 kV - 12.946 tetri/kWh;*\n\n*c) 35-110 kV - 11.878 tetri/kWh.*\n\n*2. In order to create additional guarantees for social protection of the population and to promote the rational use of electricity for Telasi JSC customers, the limiting tariffs for the purchase of electricity with a voltage of 220/380V by the amount of electricity consumed (domestic consumers (population)), shall be as follows (in 30 calendar days):*\n\n*a) up to and including 101 kWh - 11.000 tetri/kWh;*\n\n*b) 101 to and including 301 kWh - 14.400 tetri/kWh;*\n\n*c) over 301 kWh - 18.200 tetri/kWh.*291\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26, CL-0085, Art. 10.\n\n306.\n\nAlthough the 2014 Methodology initially fixed tariffs for one-year regulatory periods, Telasi's tariffs pursuant to the 2014 Methodology and Resolution No. 26 were set for 16 months (from September 2015 to 31 December 2016), in an attempt to ensure that Telasi would recover all of its costs, including the cost of purchasing electricity.292\n\n*Ibid*.; Milorava I, \u00b6 45.\n\n307.\n\nOn 20 October 2015, Inter RAO wrote to Minister Kaladze that NERC Resolution No. 26 had \"failed to take into account all [the 2013] Memorandum provisions\" by fixing Telasi's tariffs pursuant to the 2014 Methodology.293 Inter RAO also raised its previous complaints regarding grid connection charges for new subscribers and its claims for losses in energy years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 relating to the failure to compensate Telasi for losses it incurred in energy years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 resulting from the increase of its WAPT above the limit set in the 2013 Memorandum. Inter RAO requested consultations between the NERC and Telasi to be held under Minister Kaladze's direction \"aimed at making the soonest and mutually beneficial decisions that will comply with the [2013] Memorandum terms\".294\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 20 October 2015, p. 1, C-0066.\n\n*Id.*, p. 2.\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondents say that Inter RAO's complaint came after the expiry of the period for filing an appeal against NERC Resolution No. 26.295\n\nGACG, RL-0005, Art. 180.\n\n309.\n\nTelasi did not contest the legal basis of NERC Resolution No. 26 before the Georgian courts.296\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6 46.\n\n310.\n\nOn 3 November 2015, Minister Kaladze, Inter RAO (Mr. Kovalchuk) and the NERC (Ms. Milorava) met to discuss Telasi's claims for compensation for tariff years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 and adjustment of Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs on the basis of GEL depreciation.297 No agreement was reached by the Parties. On 8 December 2015, Inter RAO again complained to the MOE that no progress had been achieved, and requested another meeting.298\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 110; Meeting Agenda, dated 3 November 2015, C-0067.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 8 December 2015, C-0068; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\n311.\n\nOn 15 December 2015, the MOE and Inter RAO met again to discuss the issues raised in Inter RAO's 20 October 2015 letter: Telasi's losses in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 due to its high WAPT, losses from connecting new users and \"[o]ther issues involving the activities of Telasi JSC\".299 According to Inter ROA's Mr. Markov, Minister Kaladze informed Inter RAO that the \"indicative\" RGR in the 2013 Memorandum was the ceiling on Telasi's permitted revenues and, as such, there was no loss to compensate since Telasi had earned revenue in excess of its Appendix 2 forecast in the 2013-2014 energy year.300 Minister Kaladze also said that a potential connection fee increase would only apply to new commercial consumers.301\n\nMeeting Agenda, 15 December 2015, C-0069.\n\nMarkov I, \u00b6 61.\n\nKobtsev I, \u00b6 58.\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimants say that this is the first time Minister Kaladze (or anyone at the MOE) informed Inter RAO that the \"indicative\" RGR set out in Annex 2 of the 2013 Memorandum constituted a ceiling on Telasi's permitted revenues, such that there was no loss to compensate for the previous energy years.302 The Claimants complain that Minister Kaladze unexpectedly reversed his previous position that Telasi would be compensated for the rise in the WAPT. As discussed below, the Claimants' position is that Inter RAO and Telasi did not agree that the RGR would negate the tariff adjustment mechanisms set out in Clause 2.3 of the 2013 Memorandum, or that the forecast figure in Appendix 2 would serve as a cap on Telasi's revenue or profit. They say that there is no contemporaneous documentary support for the Respondents' position, which appears to be exclusively based on Mr. Bachiashvili's testimony that Inter RAO represented that it would not be seeking excessive levels of profit.303\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 8 December 2015, C-0068; Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 22 December 2015, C-0071; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, 61; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 110-111.\n\nMirsiyapov II, \u00b6 87; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 63.\n\n313.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, Inter RAO again complained to the MOE, citing GEL 12.5 million in losses due to the WAPT rising above the 6.028 tetri/kWh threshold provided in the 2013 Memorandum.304 Minister Kaladze replied on 6 January 2016 as follows:\n\n*Referring to the past meetings and previous correspondence, let me present our conclusions on the implementation status and events related to the Memorandum between the Government of Georgia and Inter RAO. You have repeatedly raised the issue of compensation for the electric energy procured by Telasi JSC; in the letter of December 22 you detailed the mechanisms for compensation of the so-called \"lost\" profit amounting to 12.5 mln GEL for 2013\u20132015.*\n\n*As per p. 2.3.2 of the Memorandum, in the event that the average weighted purchase tariff exceeds the ceiling level, specified in p. 2.3.1, the consumer tariff will be increased so that gross revenue of Telasi JSC remains unchanged.*\n\n*Moreover, Appendix No. 2 (Indicative performance indices of Telasi JSC) forms an integral part of the Memorandum, and during its validity period specifies a number of parameters, including a gross revenue.*\n\n*Telasi submitted the reports for 2013 and 2014 prepared by an independent auditor, covering the comparison between the actual parameters and the parameters set forth in the Memorandum. In accordance with the report, it is established that during the period under consideration, for two years the Company has received actual income of 228.676 thousand GEL instead of 194.012 thousand GEL, which is greater by 34.7 mln GEL compared to the specified figures.

The Memorandum entered into with the Government of Georgia does not cover the said issue.*\n\n*At the same time, the Ministry has been made aware of this issue, specifically, as regards the term and costs of connection, and the consultations in respect of optimization of the existing rules both with the Regulatory Commission, and other relevant bodies, are under way.*306\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n316.\n\nOn 9 February 2016, Inter RAO replied to Minister Kaladze that the numbers in Appendix 2 of the 2013 Memorandum were irrelevant to the Government's obligations under Clause 2.3.2. For the Claimants, Clause 2.3.2 required the MOE to ensure that the Consumer Tariff was automatically adjusted upward with any increase in WAPT above the 6.028 tetri/kWh threshold.307\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 9 February 2016, C-0073.\n\n317.\n\nIn March 2016, Inter RAO and the MOE met again, and the MOE proposed to compensate Telasi for its WAPT-based losses by waiving its right to any TIA for 2013-2015.308 However, no agreement was reached.\n\nSuggestions for the meeting with Minister Kaladze, dated 18 April 2016, C-0076.\n\n**3. The Adjustment of Telasi's Distribution Tariffs for GEL Depreciation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nAt their March 2016 meeting, the parties also discussed the need to adjust Telasi's (and the Khrami Companies') Distribution Tariffs due to currency fluctuations. They agreed that the next step was for Inter RAO to share with the MOE its calculation of the tariff adjustment under Clause 2.3.4 of the 2013 Memorandum, which it sent to the MOE on 11 April 2016.309 Inter RAO's calculations cited an expected 42.5% increase in the USD against the GEL from 1 September 2013 to 1 September 2016, which would trigger Telasi's right to an upwards inflation-based adjustment to their Distribution Tariffs.310 The MOE did not reply.311\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 11 April 2016, C-0075.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 116; Agenda for meeting between Inter RAO and the MOE, dated March 2016, C-0074; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\nMarkov I, \u00b6 62.\n\n319.\n\nOn 19 May 2016, Telasi applied to the NERC and the MOE pursuant to the 2013 Memorandum for approval of the Distribution Tariff adjustments it had calculated.312 Telasi asked the NERC to clarify the procedure and deadlines for the tariff adjustment requested.\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Milorava, dated 19 May 2016, C-0078. *See also*, Letter from Kobtsev to Kaladze, dated 19 May 2016, C-0079.\n\n320.\n\nOn 30 May 2016, the NERC declined to adjust Telasi's Distribution Tariff, stating that it could only adjust Telasi's tariffs according to the 2014 Methodology, and not based on the 2013 Memorandum.313 The NERC reminded Telasi that its tariffs had been set in September 2015 in accordance with the 2014 Methodology, and that they could not consider Telasi's request without receiving a full tariff application in the format prescribed under the 2014 Methodology. On 9 June 2016, Inter RAO wrote to Minister Kaladze to complain that the NERC's responses to the requests for adjustment from Telasi's and the Khrami Companies contradicted the 2013 Memorandum and the Government's prior position in the Parties' discussions.314\n\nLetter from Milorava to Kobtsev, dated 30 May 2016, C-0082. On the same date, the NERC wrote to the Khrami Companies to deny their request for an adjustment to currency fluctuations for similar reasons: Letter from Kandelaki to Milorava, dated 19 May 2016, C-0077.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 9 June 2016, C-0085.\n\n321.\n\nMeanwhile, on 2 June 2016, the MOE rejected Telasi's proposal on the basis that the tariffs could only be raised to the extent that Telasi's results fell below the RGR levels set out in the indicative projections in Appendix 2 of the 2013 Memorandum.315 As Telasi's revenue for the years from 2013 to 2015 exceeded the \"indicator [of its tariffs specified] in the [A]ppendix to the Memorandum,\" the Ministry denied Telasi's proposed adjustment of its tariffs.\n\nLetter from Valishvili to Telasi, dated 2 June 2016, C-0083.\n\n322.\n\nThroughout May and June 2016, the Parties continued to negotiate a settlement regarding Telasi's WAPT-based losses. A possible resolution discussed by the Parties involved Georgia's waiver of its right to 50% of the TIA under Clause 2.1.10 of the Memorandum; however, Telasi was not prepared to accept the MOE's request that it waive its right to a distribution tariff increase on the basis of currency depreciation.316\n\nReport on results of meeting with Kaladze, dated 30 June 2016, C-0088; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 119; Note for meeting with Kaladze, dated 18 April 2016, C-0076.\n\n323.\n\nOn 3 August 2016, Telasi applied to the NERC for its distribution tariffs to be adjusted for the depreciation of the GEL against the USD and its energy purchase costs exceeding the WAPT threshold, in accordance with Clause 2.3 of the 2013 Memorandum.317 Telasi complained of GEL 12.4 million in WAPT-based losses for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 energy years and a decrease of GEL of 12.6 million in Gross Revenue under the 2013 Memorandum over the same period. Telasi's application was not submitted in the form prescribed by the 2014 Methodology, but rather in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Memorandum.318 According to Inter ROA's Mr. Markov, Telasi filed its tariff application because the previous year's application would expire in September 2015 and the tariffs had to be adjusted under the 2013 Memorandum due to the devaluation of the GEL to the USD. Although Inter RAO was already aware from the NERC's letter of 30 May 2016 that it had a negative view of the tariff adjustments requested, Telasi filed a tariff application in order to avoid having its request denied because an official application had not been submitted.319\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Milorava re: Telasi's Application to the NERC for Clause 2.3.4 adjustment, dated 3 August 2016, C-0090.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 120; Markov I, \u00b6 65.\n\nMarkov I, \u00b6 65.\n\n324.\n\nOn 8 August 2016, the NERC replied that it had no legal basis to review or adjust Telasi's tariffs as requested because the 2014 Methodology and Resolution No. 26 governed tariff setting and tariff adjustments.320 The NERC also noted that Telasi's tariffs had been determined in 2015 by NERC Resolution No. 26 under the 2014 Methodology. Therefore, any request for adjustment was required to be under the 2014 Methodology.\n\nLetter from Milorava to Kobtsev, dated 8 August 2016, C-0094.\n\n325.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, Inter RAO wrote to the Prime Minister seeking compliance with the 2013 Memorandum. In its letter, Inter RAO requested compliance with the 2013 Memorandum with respect to Telasi's WAPT-based losses in 2013/2014 and 2014/2015, revision of tariffs due to the devaluation of the GEL against the USD by more than 7% and the decrease of Telasi's tariffs under the 2014 Methodology.321 Inter RAO also raised the NERC's refusal to accept the tariff application as submitted by the Khrami Companies (as discussed below) and its position that any revisions would be under the 2014 Methodology and not the 2013 Memorandum. The letter also referred to the obligation of the Government under the 2013 Memorandum to compensate for any damages arising from any change in Georgian legislation The letter also stated that in order to protect its interest under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, Inter RAO had no other choice but to apply to the NERC for the modification of the relevant tariffs. However, in view of the NERC's position, filing an application with it would lead to the reduction of tariffs and further increase damages to the Khrami Companies, which damages must be compensated by Georgia.322\n\nLetter from Kovalchuk, Pakhomov, Bron and Buzyanovska to Kvirikashvili, dated 21 September 2016, C-0097.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n326.\n\nThere is no record of the Prime Minister having responded to Inter RAO's letter of 21 September 2016.\n\n327.\n\nOn 10 October 2016, the NERC wrote to inform Telasi that it had to submit a tariff application for 2017 in compliance with the 2014 Methodology within 150 days prior to the expiration date of the existing tariff period and that in order to meet the deadline for calculating tariffs for 2017, requested that Telasi submit its application within 10 business days.323 The NERC also reminded Telasi that if it failed to submit a tariff application within that period, it would be subject to the sanctions stipulated by the legislation.324\n\nLetter from Milorava to Kobtsev, dated 10 October 2016, C-0098; 2014 Methodology, Art. 26(1), CL-0084.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n328.\n\nOn 21 October 2016, Telasi submitted a tariff application complaint with the 2014 Methodology but continued to insist that the 2013 Memorandum be applied. Telasi stated that since the NERC had not reviewed its application submitted on 3 August 2016 pursuant to the 2013 Memorandum, it was enclosing a tariff application with all the documents required by the NERC. It went on to insist that the provisions of the 2013 Memorandum had to be observed in considering its application.325\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Milorava re: Telasi's Application to the NERC for tariff adjustment, dated 21 October 2016, C-0102; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 210.\n\n329.\n\nThe Parties met several times in December 2016. At a meeting in mid-December 2016, the Parties agreed to postpone their discussion of Telasi's tariffs until after the NERC issued its preliminary tariff calculations.326 On 23 December 2016, the NERC's calculations were provided to Telasi and Inter RAO and the Parties met again on 24 December 2016. Inter RAO was of the view that the tariffs calculated by the NERC were not in accordance with the 2013 Memorandum and stated that the parameters set out in Annex 2 of the Memorandum were only indicative in nature. The MOE's position was that Inter RAO was not entitled to any compensation since Telasi was performing better than had been expected and the NERC's proposed tariff adjustment was consistent with the 2013 Memorandum which did not allow Inter RAO to make windfall profits.327\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 123.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 124; Markov I, \u00b6 71; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 211-213; Valishvili I, \u00b6 60.\n\n330.\n\nOn 26 December 2016, the NERC set Telasi's tariffs for 2017 pursuant to the 2014 Methodology (\"**NERC Resolution No. 38**\").328 The new Distribution Tariffs were set in accordance with the unofficial calculations to which Inter RAO had objected at the meeting of 24 December 2016. The Claimants say that the new tariffs fixed in Resolution No. 38 were unacceptable and, in effect further reduced Telasi's Distribution Tariffs. The Respondents say that this is not consistent with Telasi's position during the NERC's public hearing in which the new tariffs were presented.329\n\nNERC Resolution No. 38, dated 26 December 2016, CL-0086.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 214; Minutes of NERC Hearing No. 90, dated 26 December 2016, R-0049, p. 17.

On 1 March 2017, Telasi notified Georgia of a dispute under the 2013 Memorandum, and reserved its rights to bring claims under the BIT.332 On 14 April 2017, Silk Road gave a Notice of Dispute under the BITx and the Energy Charter Treaty to the Government.333\n\nNotice of Dispute from Telasi to Georgia (2013 Memorandum), dated 1 March 2017, C-0107.\n\nNotice of Dispute under Bilateral Investment Treaty and Energy Charter Treaty, dated 14 April 2017, C-0115.\n\n**4.

On 4 August 2017, Telasi submitted a tariff application to the NERC to set its tariffs for 2018.334 Telasi requested an adjustment of 30% of its Distribution Tariffs under Clause 2.3.4 of the 2013 Memorandum to account for the depreciation of the GEL against the USD. It also applied for a WAPT-based adjustment to its Consumer Tariffs to compensate for the reduction of Telasi's GR by GEL 46.3 million as a result of Georgia's alleged non-compliance with Clause 2.3.2 of the 2013 Memorandum for the tariff freeze period (2013-2016), which raised the purchase price of electricity by over 50% in 2016.335\n\nTariff Correction Application from Telasi to NERC, dated 4 August 2017, C-0129.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n336.\n\nOn 10 August 2017, the NERC amended the 2014 Methodology, effective from 2018 (the \"**2014 Amended Methodology**\").336 The 2014 Amended Methodology altered the tariff regulation period from one to three years and set deadlines for the submission of tariff applications to the NERC, identified the time frame for when tariff applications should be submitted (from 4 August to 15 August of the tariff-setting year), and made amendments to the formulas used for defining certain components that should be taken into account while setting the tariffs.337\n\n2014 Amended Methodology, dated 10 August 2017, effective in 2018, CL-0088.\n\n*Id*., Arts. 30-31.\n\n337.\n\nOn 27 December 2017, the NERC held a public hearing, which Telasi's Mr. Antadze attended, and it fixed new tariffs for Telasi in accordance with the 2014 Amended Methodology (\"**NERC Resolution No. 48**\").338 The new tariffs were effective from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2021. NERC Resolution No. 48 set Telasi's Distribution Tariffs at levels which were below those provided by the 2013 Memorandum, except for the smallest category (35-110 kV consumers), as summarized in the following table provided by the Claimants:339\n\n**Telsi's tariffs (fixed in 2017)**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Voltage** | **Distribution Tariffs (tetri/kWh)** |\n|  | **Resolution No 3 of 2013, Art 8 [CL-083]** | **Resolution No 48 of 2017, Art 8 [CL-091]** |\n| **220/380 V (commercial consumers)** | 8.08 | 6.472 |\n| **6-10 kV** | 7.138 | 2.712 |\n| **35-110 kV** | 1.8 | 2.058 |\n\nNERC Resolution No. 48 on Amendments to NERC Resolution No. 33 dated 4 December 2008, dated 27 December 2017 (\"**NERC Resolution No. 48**\"), CL-0091; NERC Public hearing minutes, dated 27 December 2017, C-0215.\n\nClaimants' Opening Presentation, Demonstrative No. 8; Tr.

[Khrami-1] requested additional 15 business days in the letter \u2026 of 16 August 2016, and the request was satisfied ([NERC] letter to [Khrami-1] dated 18 August 2016).

The timing of these tariff applications was a few days after filing their Request for Arbitration in these SCC proceedings.\n\n358.\n\nIn their application, the Khrami Companies used the currency exchange rate on the last day of the previous reference period for the GEL/USD adjustment as the basis of their calculation (referred to by the Parties at the Hearing as the \"**snapshot rate**\"), as opposed to the average rate over the course of the previous reference period.367 The Khrami-1 application stated as follows:\n\n*Pursuant to Resolution [No. 5] and Article 2.2 of Annex #1 of the [Khrami SPA], long-term marginal tariffs of electricity generation by [Khrami-1] shall be corrected if the change in Georgian Lari to US Dollar exchange rate exceeds 7% in comparison to the exchange rate effective as of the execution of the [Khrami SPA].

It also calculated the adjustment through to 1 November 2019.\n\n360.\n\nKhrami-2's application contained the same request with respect to the GEL/USD exchange rate as the Khrami-1 application. It also included in the requested tariffs from 1 September 2017 to 31 August 2018 an additional adjustment to losses for the failure to adjust the tariffs pursuant to its 2016 application in respect of both GEL/USD and GEL/JPY exchange rates.369\n\nKhrami-2 2017 Application, C-0122.\n\n361.\n\nThe Khrami-2 application also requested adjustment with respect to the GEL/JPY exchange rate in the following terms:\n\n*Pursuant to Article 1.1.2 of the Resolution [No. 5] ad Article 2.2.1 of Annex #1 of the [Khrami SPA], in order to ensure guaranteed debt servicing under the Agreement between the Ministry of Finance of Georgia and [Khrami-2] on the Repayment to the State of the Amounts from the Credit Granted by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency which were Disbursed for the Rehabilitation of [Khrami-2], dated of 10 December 2008, the long-term marginal tariff of electricity generation by [Khrami-2] shall be corrected on an annual basis if the change in GEL to Japanese Yen exchange rate exceeds 7% per annum upon correction in comparison to the exchange rate effective as of the adoption of tariff based on Resolution #4 of the [NERC], dated 1 April 2009.*\n\n*Correction is applied to the part of the tariff allocated for the performance of obligation.

The amount paid in relation to the liability in 2016 was 190,636 thousand Yen, as planned. Annual generated electricity in 2016 was 334 million kWh. Therefore, the increased costs of servicing the debt in 2016 which is caused by increase of GEL to Japanese Yen exchange rate must be reflected on the tariff in the amount of 0.164 tetri for each kWh.

Day 7, 230-231.\n\n368.\n\nIn Resolution Nos. 30 and 31, although the NERC agreed that the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs warranted adjustment in view of the depreciation of the GEL against the USD and JPY, it disagreed with the Khrami Companies' calculations. According to the NERC, due to exchange rate volatility, the Khrami Companies' proposed method of calculation using the exchange rate on a single day at the end of each reference year (the snapshot rate), as opposed to using the average exchange rate throughout the reference year preceding the adjustment, was not reliable.380\n\nLetter from Gabelaya to Kandelaki, dated 24 November 2017, C-0133.\n\n369.\n\nThe Department of Tariffs and Economic Analysis of the Commission did not agree with the request of KhramHPP-1 JSC on the use of the indicator of the national currency's exchange rate versus the USD as of 1 September 2016 (USD 1 = GEL 2.3062) in order to determine the national currency's exchange rate versus the USD. Since the adjustment concerns the period from 1 November 2013 to 1 November 2016 in accordance with Clause 3, Article 17 of Resolution No. 33 of the Commission dated 4 December 2008, the department believed that the average exchange rate for this period, which is USD 1 = GEL 2.0863, should be used to determine the change.381\n\n*Id.*, p. 18.\n\n370.\n\nFurther, the NERC disagreed with the Khrami Companies that the adjustment should be applied to the entire Generation Tariff, as opposed to only the difference between the long-term maximum tariffs of the Khrami Companies determined by Resolution No. 5 in 2011 and the tariffs in effect prior to it entering into force. The NERC stated as follows:\n\n*This exchange rate was compared with the exchange rate existing at the time of the conclusion of the contract for the purchase and sale of KhramHPP-1 JSC and KhramHPP-2 JSC \u2013 USD 1 = GEL 1.6454. The change amounted to 26.8%, which exceeds the 7% limit determined by the aforementioned resolution, and, consequently, the long-term maximum rate for electricity generation is subject to adjustment. At the same time, Part 1, clause 3, Article 17 of the same resolution is worded as follows: \"In order to ensure the guaranteed return of investments made during the acquisition of KhramHPP-1 JSC and KhramHPP-2 JSC, the long-term maximum tariffs (upper limit) for electricity generation by KhramHPP-1 JSC and KhramHPP-2 JSC should be adjusted if the change in the lari exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar is more than 7% compared with the rate existing at the time of the conclusion of the purchase and sale contract for KhramHPP-1 JSC and KhramHPP-2 JSC\", which implies an adjustment not for the total long-term maximum electricity generation tariff, but only an adjustment to the difference between the long-term maximum tariffs of KhramHPP-1 JSC determined by Resolution No. 5 dated 7 April 2011 and the tariffs in effect prior to this resolution entering into force (2.3 tetri/kWh), which should ensure a guaranteed return on investment made during the acquisition of KhramHPP-1 JSC and KhramHPP-2 JSC. In particular, for KhramHPP-2 JSC this difference for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 inclusive is 5.9 tetri/kWh, and from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021 inclusive is 5.4 tetri/kWh.*382\n\n*Id.*, p. 9.\n\n371.\n\nRegarding the GEL/JPY adjustment, the NERC disagreed with the Khrami Companies' comparison indicator and, as with the GEL/USD adjustment, decided that the average exchange rate for the past year should be used to determine the change, not the last day of the past period.383 The Respondents point out that in Resolution Nos. 30 and 31 of 31 October 2017, the NERC adjusted the Khrami Companies' tariffs for the GEL/USD depreciation even though its Resolution No. 5 and the Khrami SPA did not contemplate such adjustment until November 2019.\n\nTranscript of NERC public hearing regarding the Khrami Companies' tariff application, dated 31 October 2017, C-0214, pp. 1-2; NERC Public Hearing No. 80-2-3, dated 31 October 2017, R-0052.\n\n372.\n\nThe NERC also rejected the compensation request for loses from the non-adjustment of tariffs in 2016, stating that the Khrami Companies had not submitted compliant applications in 2016.384 The NERC stated as follows:\n\n*As regards the request of KhramHPP-1 JSC in connection with compensation for unearned profit for the period from 1 November 2016 to 31 August 2017 inclusive, which, according to the licensee's explanation, was caused by the fact that the Commission did not hold a discussion as part of the tariff application for the adjustment of long-term maximum tariffs submitted by KhramHPP-2 JSC dated 4 August 2016, this amount is not refundable using the electricity generation tariff since the tariff was not adjusted in 2016 through the fault of the licensee because the application was not submitted in accordance with the requirements specified by legislation, in particular the tariff application should have been submitted in a tangible form and completed in accordance with the \"Tariff application form submitted by an electricity generation licensee in order to calculate electricity generation tariffs\" approved by Decision No. 42/1 of the Commission dated 6 August 2015 taking into account the Law of Georgia \"On Electric Power and Natural Gas\". At the same time, according to Part 2, Article 83 of the General Administrative Code of Georgia, \"if an applicant fails to submit to the administrative authority any document or other information envisaged by law or by a legal act issued on its basis that is necessary to resolve a case, the administrative authority shall determine a period for the applicant during which the applicant must submit an additional document or information\", and according to Part 5, \"\"if an applicant fails to submitthe relevant document or information within the prescribed period, the administrative authority shall be authorized to decide to leave the application without consideration\". Since KhramHPP-1 JSC was unable to ensure the submission of the comprehensive tariff application that was necessary to adjust the long-term maximum tariffs for electricity generation to initiate the public administrative proceedings \"On Amendments to Resolution No. 33 of the Commission dated 4 December 2008 \"On Electricity Tariffs\" during the period specified by the Commission on the basis of legislative requirements, the Commission decided not to consider the tariff application.*385\n\nNERC public hearing transcript re Khrami Companies' tariff application, dated 31 October 2017, C-0214, p. 7.\n\nLetter from Gabelaya to Kandelaki, dated 24 November 2017, C-0133, p.19.\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimants say that in a reversal of its previous position, in Resolution Nos. 30 and 31, the NERC acknowledged that it could (and did) apply the terms of the Parties' agreement in the Khrami SPA, albeit improperly.386\n\nTr.

The company missed the deadline and hence, it is assumed that this one-year period [2016], for which the company is asking the remuneration, this is the loss incurred due to their fault and therefore, the Commission is entitled, rather, it is obliged not to consider this loss. The loss amounts to GEL 14.4 million with respect to the USD [rate] and GEL 1.2 million \u2013 with respect to the adjustments based on Yen [rate].*387\n\nNERC public hearing transcript re Khrami Companies' tariff application, dated 31 October 2017, C-0214, p. 7.\n\n375.\n\nAs set out above, the Claimants say that the Khrami Companies abandoned their 2016 tariff adjustment application because when they requested an adjustment due to the decline in the GEL against the JPY and USD,\n\n*[t]hey were told by the NERC that an adjustment would only be made in accordance with the 2014 [M]ethodology, which does not contemplate currency adjustments. On that basis, having seen what had happened in 2015 to Telasi, the Khrami Companies didn't pursue their 2016 application to the end \u2026 because they were afraid that the situation would get worse. But in the end the situation got so bad that the Khrami Companies had to seek confirmation from Georgia that the tariff deal would be respected, and it wrote a letter to the [G]overnment saying, \"Please confirm that\"; that's C-116. The [G]overnment did not reply.388*\n\n*...*\n\n*[T]here was no adjustment because the Khrami [C]ompanies had effectively been forced to abandon their application under threat of application of the 2014 [M]ethodology.*389\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 52:5-17.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 53:15-18.\n\n**R. The Claimants' Initiation of Arbitrations Against Georgia**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n376.\n\nOn 1 March 2017, Gardabani and Telasi notified Georgia of disputes under the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum and, on 14 April 2017, Gardabani and Silk Road notified Georgia of a dispute under the BIT. In June and August 2017, the Claimants filed their respective Requests for Arbitration before the SCC and ICSID. In the meantime, both Telasi and the Khrami Companies applied to the NERC for an adjustment to their tariffs, as discussed below.\n\n**S. The Parties' Settlement Discussions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nGeorgia initially offered to forego its share of the Target Investment Allowance (TIA) that Telasi had accumulated since March 2013 in exchange for a full and final waiver of all of Telasi's claims under the 2013 Memorandum as of January 2016. The Respondents say that it did so in order to address Inter RAO's purported dissatisfaction with Telasi's tariffs by offering to forego its share of the TIA up until that point, \"although Telasi's financial results in 2014 and 2015 had exceeded all expectations\".390 Ultimately, however, the parties failed to reach an agreement. The Respondents say that Georgia's portion of the TIA was to be distributed in 2017, but that before that distribution could happen, Inter RAO commenced this arbitration.391\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 186; *see also*, Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 201.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6\u00b6 62-66; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 203, 289; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 186.\n\n378.\n\nOn 12 June 2016, Inter RAO rejected Georgia's proposal to forego its share of the TIA in settlement of Telasi's WAPT-based claimed losses as the Respondents required concessions, including a waiver of Telasi's right to claim an adjustment of its distribution tariff on the basis of currency depreciation, which were not acceptable.392 The Respondents suggest that Inter RAO decided to maintain its claims with respect to Telasi as leverage for an increase in the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 119; Email from Markov to Valishvili, dated 12 June 2016, C-0087, p. 1; Email from Valishvili to Markov, dated 11 June 2016, C-0086; Report on the results of meeting with Kaladze, dated 30 June 2016, C-0088,\u00b6 9; NERC Resolution No. 30, dated 28 November 2019, RL-0103.\n\n**T. 2017/2018 Changes to the Law on Electricity**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nOn 30 June 2017, Georgia amended the Law on Electricity applicable to the 35/110 kV category to permit customers to purchase energy directly from ESCO/COPS, rather than from a distributor, effective 1 May 2018.393 This decreased Telasi's sales and allocation of energy. However, after the NERC incorporated the effect of the amended Law on Electricity into its annual plan for 2018 and modified Telasi's tariffs accordingly, on 4 May 2018, the changes were rolled back by a subsequent amendment to the Law to require customers in the 35/110 kV category to continue to purchase their energy from energy distributors.394\n\nKobtsev I, \u00b6 77; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 147-149.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**U. Subsequent Regulatory Changes and the Unbundling Regime**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nOn 28 November 2019, the NERC issued Resolutions Nos. 30 and 31, adjusting the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs for the period from 1 December 2019 to 31 December 2021 to account for the devaluation of the GEL against the USD and the JPY.395 In these tariff resolutions, the NERC increased the Generation Tariffs of Khrami-1 from 9.147 tetri/kWh (as approved in 2017) to 10.837 tetri/kWh and those of Khrami-2 from 10.614 tetri/kWh (as approved in 2017) to 12.304 tetri/kWh.396\n\nRespondents' Comments on Quantum Issues, \u00b6 9; NERC Resolutions Nos. 30 and 31, dated 28 November 2019, RL-0103; NERC Resolution No. 31, dated 28 November 20, RL-0104; NERC Resolution No.30, CL-0089; NERC Resolution No.31, dated 31 October 2017, CL-0090. These Resolution were issued following the Khrami Companies' tariff adjustment applications dated 27 September 2019: Letter from Khrami-1 to the NERC, dated 27 September 2019; Letter from Khrami-2, dated 27 September 2019, R-0100.\n\nRespondents' Comments on Quantum Issues, \u00b6 9, and the sources cited there.\n\n381.\n\nOn 29 December 2020, the NERC issued Resolution No. 83 setting out new Distribution Tariffs for Telasi for 2021-2025 as well as new Consumer Tariffs to 1 July 2021, pursuant to the 2014 Methodology.397\n\n*Id.*, \u00b610; NERC Resolution No. 83, dated 29 December 2020, BM-47.\n\n382.\n\nAs of 1 July 2021, the distribution and supply activities of vertically integrated electricity companies operating in Georgia were legally unbundled, *i.e.* the Unbundling Regime came into effect. According to the Respondents, this was a structural reform which involved the separation of potentially competitive segments (such as the production and supply of electricity) from those where competition is not possible or not permitted (such as the transmission and distribution of electricity). The Unbundling Regime required the establishment of separate legal entities for network activities and wholesale or retail activities. This was intended to harmonize Georgia's legislation and regulatory framework with EU law, which commenced with the adoption of a new tariff methodology applicable to all electricity companies operating in Georgia and to create a competitive market through the unbundling of vertically integrated companies. As a result of the unbundling, Inter RAO established a new energy supply company in Tbilisi, Telmiko LLC (\"**Telmiko**\") which took over Telasi's electricity supply activities while Telasi continued to operate the distribution network.398 The new tariff regime included a profit margin on supply activities representing a percentage of Telmiko's cost of energy, unlike under the 2014 Methodology.399\n\nRespondents' Comments on Quantum Issues, \u00b6 11.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b612. According to the Respondents, this is not disputed. The Parties agree that the Unbundling Regime does apply to the Khrami Companies, whose tariffs remained regulated by the NERC Resolutions that the Parties' experts took into account in their updated calculations. See: Email correspondence from counsel for the Claimants on behalf of the Parties, dated 5 July 2021.\n\n**V. The Claimants' Supplemental Claims**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimants' primary claims relate to the Respondent's measures which affected Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs (the \"Tariff Related Claims\"). In addition, the Claimants pursued three additional claims unrelated to Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs (the \"Supplemental Claims\").\n\n384.\n\nThe background facts relevant to these claims are set out below.\n\n**1. Cost of New Connections Issue**\n------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe 2013 Memorandum does not mention the cost of new connections. The Claimants maintain that, separate from the 2013 Memorandum, the Government assured Inter RAO and Telasi that they would fully recover Telasi's costs of connecting new customers to the distribution network400. They say this has not occurred despite the Respondents' repeated promises.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 150-154; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 85-90; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 128-129.\n\n386.\n\nPursuant to several of the NERC's Resolutions, since 2008 Telasi was obliged to connect new users to its network at its own expense, rather than users bearing the cost, as they had previously.401 Users pay a fixed amount set by the NERC (which has not changed since 2011) according to the applicable voltage class and capacity of the connection, and Telasi performs all necessary connection works at its own expense. If Telasi does not comply with the NERC's connection deadlines, it must pay a penalty. For each new connection, Telasi must obtain a construction permit from the Tbilisi town council and approvals from ecological authorities and other city authorities. Further, Claimants say that Telasi often needed fast-track construction permits which required the payment of a fee, in order to meet Georgia's connection deadlines.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 21, dated 18 September 2008, CL-0076; NERC Resolution No. 20, dated 18 September 2008, (consolidating amendments as of 26 September 2012), Art. 26, CL-0077; NERC Resolution No. 6, dated 19 April 2017, CL-0087.\n\n387.\n\nIn September 2014, Inter RAO and Telasi started complaining to the MOE that the new user connection fees were insufficient to cover Telasi's actual costs and requested full compensation of these costs from Georgia.402 The Parties' discussions continued until 2016.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 18 September 2014, C-0044.\n\n388.\n\nIn December 2014, Georgia proposed that the definition of \"Agreed Investments\" at Appendix 1 to the 2013 Memorandum be amended to include the cost of new connections so as to ensure full recovery of these costs through the mechanisms of compensation for any GRD.403 Inter RAO rejected the proposed amendment and insisted that any costs above the connection fee be compensated by way of a decrease in Telasi's WAPT.404 The MOE rejected this proposal, stating that the connection of new users expands the distribution network, and that all associated costs should be treated as investments in that network and reflected in the Distribution Tariff, not the WAPT.405 The MOE reiterated its proposal to include new connection costs within the meaning of \"Agreed Investments\", which Inter RAO rejected.406\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 182; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 87.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 16 December 2014, C-0053.\n\nLetter from Kaladze to Volkov, dated 29 December 2014, C-0055.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 45.\n\n389.\n\nCommencing in 2015, the NERC took into account the difference between Telasi's costs and the connection fee paid by a new user as capital expenditures (\"**CAPEX**\") recoverable through Telasi's Distribution Tariffs. However, the Claimants argue that the CAPEX mechanism only partly mitigated Telasi's losses, and that \"the net present value of these payments over such a long period of time [gradually over 25 years] is insufficient to cover Telasi's losses\".407 It appears that commencing in 2019 the NERC adopted new connection fees to require payment of Telasi's full costs of connection.408\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 155.\n\nTr. Day 1, (Claimants' Opening Statement), 128-129.\n\n**2. Telasi's Purchase Portfolio Volatility**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nOn 30 March 2017, Telasi paid out GEL 20 million (approximately USD 8.2 million) in dividends to its shareholders.409\n\nTelasi general meeting minutes, dated 30 March 2017, C-0109, p. 3.\n\n391.\n\nGeorgian electricity generation companies, Enguri and Vardnili, produce the cheapest electricity in Georgia. Up until May 2017, Telasi received Enguri energy approximately in proportion to Telasi's share of the Georgian distribution market, pursuant to long-term supply agreements.410 However, on 25 May 2017, the MOE reduced Telasi's usual allocation of Enguri energy because of a purported imbalance between the costs and revenue of energy generation companies in Georgia, which resulted in instability in the electricity system and distribution companies having difficulty paying taxes.411\n\nTelasi has a 35% market share and Energo-Pro holds the remaining 65% (Energo-Pro purchased Kakheti in 2017).\n\nLetter from Valishvili to Telasi *et al*, dated 25 May 2017, C-0117.\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimants claim that in the eight-month period between May-December 2017, the NERC's allocation of energy purchases to Telasi from Enguri followed an *ad hoc* pattern that departed from the planned amounts used to set Telasi's WAPT. In each of May, June and July 2017, Telasi applied to the ESCO/COPS to approve the amount of Enguri energy forecasted in the NERC's Annual Energy Plan, which ESCO/COPS declined, citing technical difficulties in transferring electricity to Tbilisi.412\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 163; Kobtsev I, \u00b6 65.\n\n393.\n\nThe Parties agree that the unavailability of Enguri energy caused an increase in the purchase cost of electricity on the Georgian market. Telasi sought to cover the shortfall in cheap Enguri energy with purchases from more expensive electricity sources.\n\n394.\n\nOn 25 August 2017, the MOE informed Telasi that an additional volume of 50 million kWh of Enguri energy would be allocated to Telasi to cover the earlier shortage.413\n\nLetter from Valishvili to Telasi, Enguri, Energo-pro, COPS and GSE, dated 25 August 2017, C-0131, p. 1.\n\n**3. Diversion of the Khrami Companies' Electricity and Sales to Third Parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nIn October 2017, the NERC adjusted the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs to increase them by over 19%.414\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 200.\n\n396.\n\nIn 2018, the NERC diverted the energy produced by the Khrami Companies away from Telasi for the period from May to August 2018 and replaced it with energy from Enguri.415\n\nNERC Resolution No. 48 (new Telasi tariffs based on the NERC's 2018 Annual Energy Plan), CL-0091; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 169. (By way of background, since the early 2000s, 100% of the Khrami Companies' output had been supplied to Telasi, and made up 15% of its annual purchases.)\n\n397.\n\nOn 25 December 2017, the NERC shared with Mr. Antadze Telasi's forecasted purchase portfolio for 2018-2020, which stated that Telasi would not receive energy from the Khrami Companies in May-July 2018.416\n\nEmail from the NERC to Telasi, dated 25 December 2017, R-0077.\n\n398.\n\nThe Khrami Companies found alternative buyers for their electricity for the remainder of 2018,417 at lower prices than the tariff Telasi would have paid. The Claimants say this was in order to avoid their entire output being deemed acquired by ESCO/COPS at a price substantially lower than the applicable Generation Tariffs.418\n\nPurchase Agreements between Khrami-2 and Geo Servers, dated 15 May 2018, C-0137; Khrami-2 and GFDC Georgia, dated 15 May 2018, C-0138; Khrami-1 and Geo Servers, dated 24 May 2018, C-0139; Khrami-1 and BFDC Georgia, dated 24 May 2018, C-0140; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 201.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 170; Purchase Agreements between Khrami-2 and Geo Servers, dated 15 May 2018, C-0137; Khrami-2 and GFDC Georgia, dated 15 May 2018, C-0138; Khrami-1 and Geo Servers, dated 24 May 2018, C-0139; Khrami-1 and BFDC Georgia, 2 dated 4 May 2018, C-0140.\n\n399.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants say that Telasi purchased energy from another distributor and ESCO/COPS at higher tariffs because the NERC did not allocate the full amount of Enguri energy to Telasi. ESCO/COPS's reason for the under-supply from Enguri to Telasi was that the contract between Georgia and Energo-Pro (Telasi's competitor), provided that Energo-Pro had the right to a fixed volume of Enguri energy.419\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 171.\n\n**W. Findings on Liability in the SCC Partial Award on Liability**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nIn the Partial Award on Liability in the SCC arbitration, the majority of the Tribunal reached the following conclusion:\n\n*1) The Claimants' Claim for a WAPT-based Adjustment under Clause 2.3.2 for the Period Prior to September 2015*\n\n*649. The Tribunal has found that this adjustment mechanism is independent of Clause 2.2.2 and the RGR mechanism. However, this adjustment is covered by the tariff freeze in Clause 2.2.3 which covers the period from 1 April 2013 through 31 December 2016. Therefore, this claim must fail.*\n\n*2) The Claimants' Claim with Respect to the Inflation and Currency-based Adjustments under Clause 2.3.4*\n\n*650. The Claimants' first formal request for an adjustment under Clause 2.3.4 was made on 19 May 2016.420 Although this request was made after 3 September 2015, it includes a claim for a currency adjustment of the exchange rate of the GEL to the USD for period two under Clause 2.3.4 (1 September 2013 to 1 September 2016). The change in the GEL/USD exchange rate during this period appears to qualify for an adjustment during this period and, possibly, for the period prior to 3 September 2015. The Claimants are entitled to an adjustment of Telasi's Distribution Tariff for this period based on the average exchange rate over the relevant review periods. Pursuant to Clause 2.3.4(b), this adjustment should be applied to 30% of Telasi's Distribution Tariff.*\n\n*3) The Claimants' Claim of Breaches of Clauses 2.2.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 after 3 September 2015*\n\n*651. The NERC's application of the 2014 Methodology and the Amended 2014 Methodology and its failure to apply the long-term tariff rates set out in Clause 2.2.1 and the tariff adjustment provisions of Clauses 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 do not, in themselves, constitute a breach of those clauses. Therefore, these claims fail. However, the Claimants' contractual rights under each of these provisions constitute part of the relevant position for the purpose of compensation pursuant to Clause 5.2.*\n\n*652. At 31 March 2013 when the 2013 Memorandum was concluded, Telasi's position included the right to the application of the tariffs contained in Tables 1 and 2 of Clause 2.2.1, including a return to the previous higher tariffs applicable in 2012, in particular the Distribution Tariffs, as of 1 January 2017 and adjustments under Clauses 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 subject to Clause 2.2.3.*\n\n*4) The Claimants' Claim for Breach of Clause 5.2*\n\n*653. A comparison of Telasi's position at 31 March 2013 with its position under the application of the 2014 Methodology (and the Amended 2014 Methodology), indicates that the Claimants have suffered losses as a result of the application of the Methodology. The amount of compensation due will depend on calculations taking into account the Tribunal's findings on how the adjustments under Clauses 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 must be applied and calculations based on directions on quantum from the Tribunal which will be provided separately to the Parties. At this stage, the Tribunal finds that compensation is due under Clause 5.2 and has not been paid by the Respondents. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondents are liable for the payment of compensation to be determined in the next phase of this arbitration which will determine the quantum of the Claimants' claims.*421\n\nLetter from Kobtsev to Kaladze dated 19 May 2016, C-0079.\n\nSCC Partial Award on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 649-653.\n\n401.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal upheld the Counterclaim brought by the Claimants in the SCC arbitration (the Government of Georgia and the Partnership Fund) under the 2013 Memorandum as follows:\n\n*675. The Respondents are entitled to payment of a 50% share of the TIA. The amount of compensation payable is to be set off against the compensation owing to the Claimants and is subject to calculation on the basis of the Tribunal's findings on liability and directions on quantum.*422\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 675.\n\n402.\n\nInsofar as Gardabani's claims under the Khrami SPA are concerned, the Tribunal reached the following conclusions in the Partial Award on Liability:\n\n*794. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal has reached the following conclusions regarding the Claimants' claims under the Khrami SPA:*\n\n*a. Gardabani did not waive or fail to meet a condition precedent to its claims for adjustments of the tariffs of the Khrami Companies;*\n\n*b. The Government, the MOE and the SSB have breached their obligations under Clause 5.2.2 and Clause 2 of the Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA in the following manner:*\n\n*i. By failing to ensure the application of the adjustment provisions in Clause 2 of Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA to the Khrami Companies' application for adjustments in 2016;*\n\n*ii. By failing to ensure the use of the Snapshot Rate for the GEL/JPY exchange rate when making the currency adjustments in Clause 2.1 of Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA;*\n\n*iii. By failing to ensure the use of the Snapshot Rate for the GEL/USD exchange rate when making the currency adjustments in Clause 2.2 of Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA;*\n\n*iv. By failing to ensure that the GEL/USD currency adjustment under Clause 2.2 of Annex #1 of the Khrami SPA was made to the entire tariff (less any portion already adjusted for under Clause 2.1 of Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA);*\n\n*v. By failing to compensate Gardabani and the Khrami Companies pursuant to Clause 5.2.2 for any damage or losses arising from the non-application or alteration of the tariffs and their conditions of adjustment as required under Clause 2 of Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA.*423\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 794.\n\n403.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal found that the Government of Georgia, the MOE and the SSB breached their obligations under Clause 5.2.2 and Clause 2 of Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA and were required to compensate Gardabani for the loss suffered by it. Further, the Tribunal found that the Government had breached its obligation under Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum and was required to pay compensation to Telasi and Inter RAO for the loss suffered by them. In addition, the Tribunal found that the Government of Georgia is entitled to its 50% share of the TIA under the 2013 Memorandum.\n\n**V. OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' CLAIMS AND DEFENSES**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below a general summary of the Parties' claims and defences in this arbitration and their relationship to the claims and defences in the SCC Arbitration before turning to each of the claims in this arbitration in more detail.\n\n405.\n\nThe Claimants are Gardabani and Silk Road and the Respondent is the Government of Georgia. In this ICSID Arbitration, the Claimants pursue a number of claims in addition to the contractual claims brought by Inter RAO, Telasi and Gardabani in the SCC Arbitration. The Respondent advances a counterclaim in both arbitrations, as well. While these claims are brought on the basis of alleged breaches of the BIT, most of the damages claimed in this arbitration overlap with damages claimed in the SCC Arbitration; these are for the losses claimed as a result of the alleged tariff-related breaches. The Claimants note this and confirm that they do not seek double recovery.\n\n406.\n\nIn their agreement on the coordination of the SCC and ICSID arbitrations, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal shall render separate awards in each arbitration.424\n\nAgreement on Coordination, dated 14 February 2018. *See* \u00b6 31 above.\n\n407.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its claims under the BIT and that the Parties have consented to submit disputes arising out of a breach of the BIT to a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention.425 The Claimants say that both Gardabani and Silk Road are protected investors (nationals of the Netherlands) under the BIT with qualifying investments (respectively the Khrami Companies and their contractual rights, and the 75.11% shareholding in Telasi and its assets and its contractual rights). The Claimants say that the dispute and their claims fall within the jurisdiction of ICSID and this Tribunal. However, they say the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the Respondent's counterclaim since it does not fall within the scope of the Parties' consent to arbitration under the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 223.\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent raised no objection to jurisdiction. Accordingly, the issue of jurisdiction will not be discussed further in this award except to the extent necessary in the discussion of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide the Respondent's Counter-Claim.\n\n409.\n\nHowever, after the issuance of the Partial Award on Liability in the SCC claim, the Respondent objected that the Claimants' tariff related claims are not admissible. In their Observations on the Partial Award, the Respondents raised the objection that the Claimants' claims under the BIT in this arbitration seek relief for the same harm as, and are duplicative of, the contract claims brought by the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration (Telasi, Inter RAO and Gardabani). The Respondent alleges that in the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal found breaches of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and held that the Respondent was required to pay compensation as a result of those breaches. Therefore, the Partial Award fully remedied the harm suffered by the Claimants in this arbitration relating to those contractual breaches. The Respondents say that this renders the Claimants' treaty claims seeking relief for the same harm inadmissible.426 The Respondent does not raise the same objection with respect to the Supplemental Claims, which were not addressed in the SCC arbitration.\n\nIn their Observations on the Partial Award, dated 14 May 2021, the Respondents submitted in response to the Claimants' claims under the umbrella clause in the BIT that the underlying contracts (the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA) contained exclusive dispute resolution mechanisms which were effectively exercised by the Claimants. This was not formally raised as an objection to jurisdiction. Therefore, the Tribunal addresses this issue as part of its analysis of the Claimants' claims under the umbrella clause.\n\n410.\n\nThe Claimants disagreed for a number of reasons. They argued that the Partial Award establishes liability in the SCC Arbitration under the relevant contracts and that the Tribunal had not yet ordered compensation for the breaches of those contracts, nor have the Respondents paid any compensation. Therefore, no harm will have been remedied until the Respondents pay compensation to the SCC Claimants.427\n\nClaimants' letter of 2 July 2021, p. 2. Since the Parties' submissions in their pleadings and in their Observations on the Partial Award, the Tribunal has issued the Partial Award and the First and Second Partial Awards on Damages in the SCC arbitration, in which the Tribunal has ordered the payment of compensation for the contractual breaches addressed in the SCC arbitration.\n\n411.\n\nFurther, the Claimants say that the Respondent's conduct in breach of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum harmed them (Gardabani and Silk Road) and violated their rights as qualifying investors under the BIT. According to them, their claims as protected investors under the BIT and the ICSID Convention are separate from the contractual claims by the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration. The Claimants say that the possibility of double recovery is not an issue of admissibility but, rather, relates to the merits and raises no concern in this case.\n\n412.\n\nThe Claimants also say that when the Parties agreed at the outset that the two arbitrations would be coordinated but would result in separate awards, it was plain that the facts underlying the two arbitrations were very similar and that the awards would address overlapping harms. It was on this understanding that they agreed to coordinate the two arbitrations. They say that the Respondent's objection on admissibility was made late.\n\n413.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Claimants bring their claims pursuant to Article 3(1) (fair and equitable treatment and impairment) and 3(4) of the BIT (umbrella clause).\n\n414.\n\nFirst, the Claimants allege that the Respondent failed to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment, as required by Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Claimants say that the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT required the Respondent to treat their investments fairly, including in a manner that was transparent, consistent, stable, predictable, in good faith and in fulfilment of their legitimate expectations as investors.428\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 243, citing *Murphy Exploration & Production Company \u2013 International v. the Republic of Ecuador*, Partial Final Award, dated 6 May 2016 (\"***Murphy v. Ecuador***\"), CL-0042, \u00b6 206 and *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, dated 27 August 2009, CL-0013.\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent frustrated Gardabani's legitimate expectations by failing to provide the stable legal and business environment that it had the right to expect. The Claimants say that the application of the 2014 Methodology to the Khrami Companies violated Gardabani's legitimate expectation based on the Respondent's assurances, the 2011 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and NERC Resolution No. 5 that the Khrami Companies' tariffs would be set and adjusted in accordance with the specific regime agreed in the Khrami SPA.429 The Claimants also allege that the Respondent acted inconsistently, irrationally and contrary to the principles of transparency in its treatment of Gardabani by adopting inconsistent positions with respect to the application of the 2014 Methodology rather than the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum.430 In addition, the Claimants allege that the Respondent acted erratically and in a non-transparent manner in relation to the Khrami Companies when it diverted output away from Telasi during the period of May to July 2018.431\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 248-253.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 264-266.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 262-263.\n\n416.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants allege that the Respondent failed to provide Silk Road with the stable legal and business environment that it legitimately expected. In taking the position that the 2014 Methodology trumped all of the agreements in place governing Telasi's Consumer and Distribution Tariffs, the Respondent acted unfairly and vitiated Silk Road's legitimate expectations.432 The Claimants also say that the Respondent acted inconsistently and in a non-transparent manner in its dealings with Telasi with respect to the setting and adjustment of its tariffs and imposing the 2014 Methodology rather than the agreed tariff regime in the 2013 Memorandum.433 Further, the Claimants allege that the Respondent acted erratically and non-transparently in the manner in which it regulated Telasi's economic activities, including the allocation of low-cost energy from Enguri, diversion of energy from the Khrami Companies, which negatively affected both Telasi and the Khrami Companies, and connection of new users to the electrical network.434\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 254-255.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 264-266.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 257-261; see SCC Partial Award on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 338-343.\n\n417.\n\nSecond, the Claimants say that the Respondent impaired their investments in contravention of Article 3(1) of the BIT by way of its unreasonable conduct in failing to ensure that the tariffs applicable to Telasi and the Khrami Companies were set and adjusted as provided for in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. The Claimants say that the Respondent recognized that it was bound to ensure the application of the tariff related provisions of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and to compensate for any loss that resulted from its failure to do so. By insisting on the application of the 2014 Methodology and failing to identify any rational purpose for its conduct, the Respondent acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and impaired the Claimants' investments.435\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 272-274; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 194-201.\n\n418.\n\nThird, the Claimants also allege that, in breach of Article 3(4) of the BIT (the \"Umbrella Clause\"), the Respondent failed to observe its binding commitments with regard to their specific investments. The Claimants say that the protected obligations include both contractual and non-contractual obligations. They allege that Georgia failed to observe its contractual obligations with regard to each of them for the reasons set out in the breach of contract claims in the SCC Arbitration. They also say that the Respondent failed to observe non-contractual obligations directed at Telasi and Gardabani when it resiled from the tariff terms applicable to Telasi under NERC Resolution No. 3 and to the Khrami Companies under NERC Resolution No. 5.436\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 275-281; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 202-207.\n\n419.\n\nThe Claimants seek full compensation for the alleged Treaty breaches under both international law and Georgian law standards in the form of damages. Initially, the Claimants quantified these as no less than USD 143,622,000 and no more that USD 209,904,000.437 Subsequently, the Claimants recalculated the damages they seek in accordance with the Tribunal's Directions on Quantum, dated 19 April 2021.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6270.\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimants break out the total damages they seek into three categories. The first is for the alleged tariff losses suffered by Telasi and the Khrami Companies and claimed in both arbitrations.438 The second is for alleged losses caused by changes to Telasi's purchase portfolio in 2017, which are quantified as USD 13,000.439 The third is for the alleged losses caused to the Khrami Companies and Gardabani as a result of having to sell electricity to third parties in 2018 at lower tariffs, which are quantified as USD 1.52 million.440\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 251-255.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 256.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 257.\n\n421.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' claims, the Respondent denies that it has breached any provision of the BIT or that it owes any compensation to the Claimants.441 The Respondent says that its conduct was transparent and reasonable and was guided by a legitimate public policy objective.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 338-362; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 344-398.\n\n422.\n\nAs described previously, the Respondent says that none of the Claimants' tariff-related claims are admissible since the Partial Award in the SCC Arbitration fully remedies the harm suffered by the Claimants: Gardabani, as a Claimant in both the SCC and this arbitration, as a result of breaches of the Khrami SPA; Silk Road, which owns 75.11% of Telasi, seeks damages commensurate with its shareholding interest as a result of breaches of the 2013 Memorandum.442\n\nRespondent's Observations on Quantum, dated 14 May 2021; Respondent's letter dated 23 June 2021. The Tribunal addresses the question of admissibility of the Claimants' tariff-related breaches separately, below.\n\n423.\n\nWith respect to the alleged breaches of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, the Respondent says that Article 3(1) does not protect investors against a state's legitimate exercise of its right to change its laws. The Respondent says that the legitimate expectations that the Claimants allege never arose. Further, it says that it acted in a predictable, transparent and reasonable manner with respect to Silk Road's and Gardabani's investments.\n\n424.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Respondent also denies that it impaired either of the Claimants' investments through arbitrary or unreasonable treatment.\n\n425.\n\nWith respect to the claim under the umbrella clause in Article 3(4) of the BIT, the Respondent says that there is no basis for a claim since it did not undertake any obligations with respect to the Claimants, as required under the BIT. In any event, the Respondent says that it complied with its obligations under the 2013 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and the NERC resolutions in question.443\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 365-383; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 399-410.\n\n426.\n\nIn its Observations on Quantum, the Respondent also took the position that there could be no breach of the umbrella clause as alleged by the Claimants since the underlying contracts, the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, contain exclusive dispute resolution mechanisms. It says that these were successfully engaged by the Claimants who have obtained full redress for their losses through the SCC Partial Award.444\n\nRespondent's Observations on Quantum, dated 14 May 2021, p. 5; Respondent's letter dated 23 June 2021.\n\n427.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal considers the Claimants' claim pursuant to the Umbrella Clause, the Respondent brings a counterclaim against Silk Road for its share of the TIA under the 2013 Memorandum. The Respondent says that its counterclaim and related damages arise out of Telasi's obligations under the 2013 Memorandum and are direct counterparts to the Claimants' claims under the BIT for alleged violations of the 2013 Memorandum. According to the Respondent, its counterclaim falls within the broad scope of Article 9 of the BIT and the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent's claim is for 50% of any TIA accumulated between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015, which it says it is entitled to receive under Clauses 2.1.8 and 2.1.10 of the 2013 Memorandum. The Respondent claims GEL 12.4 million plus interest.\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent also says that the Claimants have not demonstrated that they suffered any damages.445\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 384-411; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 425-464.\n\n429.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's updated counterclaim,446 the Claimants maintain that it is not within the Tribunal's jurisdiction since there is no substantive legal basis under the BIT for such a claim. Further, Silk Road has not consented to arbitration of the counterclaim.447 In any event, the Claimants say that the Respondent's counterclaim should be dismissed since any share of the TIA claimed was to be distributed through an adjustment to Telasi's WAPT and not through a cash payment. While other forms of distribution of the TIA are permitted under Clause 2.1.11 of the 2013 Memorandum, the Claimants say that any such distribution had to be in compliance with legislation effective at the relevant time. Further, any cash distribution would have to be agreed with Telasi and implemented by it. As a result, the Claimants say that there is no legal basis for the Respondent to receive a cash distribution of its share of the TIA.448\n\nInitially, the Respondent claimed its share of any TIA in the future. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent confirmed that it was seeking GEL 15.5 million for its counterclaim, calculated by its expert as Georgia's 50 percent share of the TIA that Telasi earned between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015 (GEL 23.3 million) less GEL 10.9 million in tax settlements paid by Inter RAO that were to be offset against the TIA according to the 2013 Memorandum, plus interest (GEL 3.1 million as of 31 December 2018). *See* Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 472-479.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 208-210; Claimants' Rejoinder on Counter-Claims, \u00b6\u00b6 24-31.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 155-157, 211-212; Claimants' Rejoinder on Counter-Claims, \u00b6\u00b6 8-14, 32.\n\n430.\n\nFurther, the Claimants say that if the Tribunal were to determine that a cash payment for the 2013-2016 TIA is warranted, any such amount is subject to set off against subsequent gross revenue deficits pursuant to Clause 2.1.12 of the 2013 Memorandum.449\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 212, 261-266; Claimants' Rejoinder on Counter-Claims, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\n**VI. REQUESTED RELIEF**\n------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n431.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n*(a) DECLARE that Georgia violated Article 3(1) of the BIT by failing to accord Gardabani's and Silk Road's investments fair and equitable treatment and impairing their investments through the adoption of unreasonable measures;*\n\n*(b) DECLARE that by failing to observe its binding commitments with regard to Gardabani's and Silk Road's investments Georgia breached Article 3(4) of the BIT;*\n\n*(c) DECLARE that it lacks jurisdiction over Georgia's counterclaim in respect of the Target Investment Allowance;*\n\n*(d) DISMISS Georgia's counterclaim for payment of a portion of any Target Investment Allowance and pre- and post-award interest and their corresponding claim for set-off under the 2013 Memorandum;*\n\n*(e) ORDER Georgia to pay full compensation to Gardabani and Silk Road for harm caused to their investments as a result of its violations of the BIT.*450\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 269.\n\n432.\n\nIn the SCC Arbitration, the Claimants claim the following relief:\n\n*Gardabani asks that this Tribunal:*\n\n*(a) DECLARE that Georgia, the Ministry of Economy and the State Service Bureau have breached their obligations under Clauses 1.15 and 5.5.2 and Clause 2 of Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA;*\n\n*(b) ORDER Georgia, the Ministry of Economy and the State Service Bureau to pay full compensation to Gardabani for harm caused as a result of their breaches of the Khrami SPA.*\n\n*[Telasi and Inter RAO] ask that this Tribunal:*\n\n*(a) DECLARE that the Government has breached its obligations under Clauses 2.2, 2.3 and 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum;*\n\n*(b) DISMISS the Respondents' counterclaim for payment of a portion of any Target Investment Allowance and pre- and post-award interest and their corresponding claim for set-off under the 2013 Memorandum;*\n\n*(c) ORDER the Government to pay full compensation to Telasi and Inter RAO for harm caused as a result of its breaches of the 2013 Memorandum.*451\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 267-268.\n\n433.\n\nWith respect to damages, the Claimants ask that this Tribunal:\n\n*(a) ORDER that the amounts cumulatively payable by the Respondents pursuant to paragraphs 267(b), 268(c) and 269(e) shall be no less than . US$143,622,000 [USD 140,022,000] and no more than . US$209,904,000 [USD 206,304,000];*452\n\n*(b) ORDER the Respondents to pay post-award interest at a reasonable commercial rate, compounded quarterly, accruing until payment is made in full;*\n\n*(c) ORDER the Respondents to indemnify the Claimants for any taxation liability that arises in relation to the Tribunal's award;*\n\n*(d) ORDER the Respondents to pay the Claimants, jointly and severally, all costs and fees of these arbitrations, including the administrative fees and costs of the SCC and ICSID Arbitrations, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Claimants' legal and other costs in these proceedings; and*\n\n*(e) ORDER such further and other relief as counsel may advise and the Tribunal deems just.*453\n\nThis decrease in the amount claimed is due to USD 3.6 million correction notified by the Claimants and their expert, Mr. Peer, at the hearing for the 35/110 kV category.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 270.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Requests for Relief**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n*i) deny Gardabani's and Silk Road's claims under the Georgia-Netherlands BITx in their entirety;*\n\n*ii) declare that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Georgia's counterclaim for its share of the Target Investment Allowance that Silk Road accumulated between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015;*\n\n*iii) declare that Georgia is entitled to its fifty percent share of the Target Investment Allowance that Silk Road accumulated between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015;*\n\n*iv) order Telasi and Inter RAO to pay Georgia GEL 12.4 million for its share of the Target Investment Allowance accumulated between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015, it being understood that the satisfaction of this counterclaim under the Georgia-Netherlands BIT satisfies the counterclaim under the 2013 Memorandum and vice versa;*\n\n*v) order Telasi and Inter RAO to pay pre- and post-award interest on all amounts due to Georgia under the 2013 Memorandum to be calculated by the Tribunal with reference to the cost of debt used by the NERC to calculate Telasi's tariffs for 2017 and 2018;*\n\n*vi) order Silk Road and Gardabani jointly and severally to pay all costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, legal fees and expenses, fees and expenses of experts and consultants, and expenses of witnesses) incurred by Georgia in connection with the preparation for and conduct of this arbitration; and*\n\n*vii) grant Georgia any such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems just and appropriate in the circumstances.*454\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 480(b).\n\n435.\n\nIn the SCC Arbitration, the Respondents request that the Tribunal:\n\n*i) deny Gardabani's claims under the Khrami SPA in their entirety;*\n\n*ii) deny Telasi's and Inter RAO's claims under the 2013 Memorandum in their entirety;*\n\n*iii) declare that Georgia is entitled to its fifty percent share of the Target Investment Allowance that Telasi accumulated between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015;*\n\n*iv) order Telasi and Inter RAO to pay Georgia GEL 12.4 million for its share of the Target Investment Allowance accumulated between 1 April 2013 and 2 September 2015, it being understood that the satisfaction of this counterclaim under the 2013 Memorandum satisfies Georgia's counterclaim under the Georgia-Netherlands BIT and vice versa;*\n\n*v) order Telasi and Inter RAO to pay pre- and post-award interest on all amounts due to Georgia under the 2013 Memorandum to be calculated by the Tribunal with reference to the cost of debt used by the NERC to calculate Telasi's tariffs for 2017 and 2018;*\n\n*vi) order the Claimants jointly and severally to pay all costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, legal fees and expenses, fees and expenses of experts and consultants, and expenses of witnesses) incurred by Georgia in connection with the preparation for and conduct of this arbitration; and*\n\n*vii) grant Georgia any such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems just and appropriate in the circumstances.*455\n\nId., \u00b6 480(a).\n\n**VII. ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\") requires that the BIT be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".456 The Claimants submit that the object and purpose of the BIT was to set out the treatment to be accorded by the party host state to investments by nationals of the other in order to \"stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties\".457 The Claimants submit that the BIT required the Respondent:\n\n*(a) to ensure fair and equitable treatment of Gardabani's and Silk Road's investments;*\n\n*(b) not to impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory means, the operation, management use, enjoyment or disposal by Gardabani or Silk Road of their respective investments; and*\n\n*(c) to observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.*458\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 239, citing VCLT (23 May 1969; in force on 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, CL-0005, Article 31.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 240 referring to the preamble of the Georgia-Netherlands BIT, CL-0003.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 241.\n\n437.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent's conduct breached each of these requirements while the Respondent maintains that it did not breach any obligation owed to either Claimant under the BIT.\n\n438.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will first address the Respondent's objection that the Claimants' claims related to the tariffs of Telasi and the Khrami Companies are inadmissible since they seek relief for the same harm as and duplicate the contract claims by Telasi, Inter RAO and Gardabani under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA in the SCC Arbitration. The Tribunal will then review the protections said to be afforded to the Claimants under Article 3 of the BIT before turning to an analysis of each of the Claimants' claims and the Respondent's defences. As arbitrator Douglas dissents with the Tribunal's conclusions, with the exception of those relating to the Supplemental Claims and costs, reference to the \"Tribunal\" in the other following sections of this award is intended to refer to the majority of the Tribunal.\n\n**A. Admissibility**\n--------------------\n\n439.\n\nIn their claims for damages in each of the two arbitrations, the Claimants calculated the losses they seek to recover for the tariff-related claims using the same calculation and claiming, for the most part, the same amount, albeit on different legal grounds. In the SCC Arbitration, all of the claims are for tariff-related breaches of contract. In this arbitration, the claims are for violations of the BIT and international law. These include the Supplemental Claims which are not related to the setting or adjustment of tariffs and were not pursued in the SCC Arbitration.459\n\nThe Claimants initially claimed in excess of USD 200 million on account of their tariff-related claims and USD 1,533,000 on account of the Supplemental Claims. In its Final Award on Damages in the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal awarded payment to Telasi in the amount of USD 84,500,000 and to Gardabani in the amount of USD 27,499,000 in respect of their tariff-related claims.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nIn their observations on the Tribunal's Partial Award in the SCC Arbitration (the \"Respondents' Observations on Quantum\"), the Respondent submitted that the Partial Award on Liability deprived Gardabani and Silk Road of standing to pursue treaty claims relating to tariff-related breaches of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum and rendered any such claims in this arbitration inadmissible.460\n\nRespondents' Observations on Quantum, dated 14 May 2021, pp. 1-2.\n\n441.\n\nThe Respondent says that the existence of several legal bases for arbitration does not necessarily mean that various entities in the same shareholder chain can make use of existing arbitration agreements to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances. In this regard, the Respondent refers to the decision in *OTMTI v. Algeria,* which held as follows:\n\n*\u2026the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host state's wrongful measures\u2026 [i]f the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances.*461\n\n*Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, dated 31 May 2017 (\"***OTMTI***\" or \"***OTMTI v. Algeria***\"), RL-0105, \u00b6 495.\n\n442.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, where one company in a shareholder chain is made whole through arbitration proceedings, companies higher up in the same corporate chain are made whole as well and their claims are accordingly inadmissible to the extent that those claims relate to derivative losses suffered by the company, rather than personal losses. With the exception of Silk Road's claim relating to Telasi's purchase portfolio volatility and Gardabani's claim relating to the redirection of its sales away from Telasi (two of the Supplemental Claims), the Claimants' claims under the BIT seek relief for the same harm as, and are duplicative of, the contractual claims brought by Telasi and Inter RAO under the 2013 Memorandum and by Gardabani under the Khrami SPA in the SCC Arbitration.462\n\nRespondents' Observations on Quantum, pp. 1-2.\n\n443.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Claimants have acknowledged that the conduct which led to their international law claims under the BIT and their contractual claims under the Agreements is largely the same, as is the harm alleged to have been suffered by them. The Respondent notes that the claim for damages advanced by the Claimants is precisely the same with respect to the tariff-related contract claims and treaty claims.463\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n444.\n\nThe Respondent says that in the Partial Award on Liability, the Tribunal found breaches of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and ordered that the Respondents (which include the Government of Georgia) must compensate Gardabani, Telasi and Inter RAO for the losses suffered by them as a result of the breaches of those agreements. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Partial Award on Liability fully remedies the harm suffered by Gardabani (which is a Claimant in both the SCC and ICSID Arbitrations) as a result of the breaches of the Khrami SPA as well as the harm suffered by Silk Road (which owns 75.11% of Telasi and seeks damages commensurate with its shareholding interest) as a result of the breaches of the 2013 Memorandum. The Respondent notes that in the Partial Award on Liability, the Tribunal not only found breaches of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum, but also found that the Government \"must compensate\" Gardabani, Telasi and Inter RAO \"for the loss suffered by [them]\".464 Therefore, the Tribunal ordered compensation and the only remaining issue was the precise amount of losses suffered by the Claimants.465\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRespondents' letter of 23 June 2021, p. 1. Since the Partial Award on Liability, the Tribunal has partially quantified the losses of the Claimants in the first two Partial Awards on Damages and the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration.\n\n445.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Claimants' attempt to distinguish the decision of the tribunal in *OTMTI v. Algeria* on the basis that settlement payments had been made by the respondent State in that case, is misconceived. According to the Respondent, the *OTMTI* tribunal dismissed the claimant's claims in that case on the basis that the claimant's subsidiary had initiated separate proceedings against Algeria seeking relief for the same harm, and not simply because settlement payments had been made to the claimant's subsidiary. The Respondent says that the tribunal in *OTMTI* explained that by commencing proceedings against Algeria, the claimant's subsidiary had \"placed itself in the position of being made whole for the alleged harm\" and thus deprived other entities in the corporate chain of standing to bring separate claims relating to the same harm.466 The Respondent says that in this case Gardabani and Silk Road initiated proceedings after Gardabani, Inter RAO and Telasi had commenced proceedings by way of the SCC Arbitration seeking relief for the same harm as they pursue in this arbitration. According to the Respondent, that harm has now been remedied by way of the Partial Award on Liability.467\n\nRespondents' Observations on Quantum, pp. 1-2; *OTMTI v. Algeria,* RL-0105, pp. 496-498.\n\nSince the Partial Award on Liability, in its Partial Awards on Damages in the SCC Arbitration the Tribunal has partially quantified the losses suffered by the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration and ordered payment. In the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal finalized the quantification of damages and awarded payment to Telasi and Gardabani.\n\n446.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant full reparation for the injuries that an investor may have suffered as a result of a host state's measures. They say that it is on this basis that the tribunal in *OTMTI* held, as quoted above, that \"\u2026[i]f the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible\". Therefore, even if the breaches of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA determined in the Partial Award constitute breaches of the BIT (which the Respondent denies), the Claimants' treaty claims in this arbitration based on breaches of contract are nonetheless inadmissible as they have been fully repaired in the Partial Award on Liability (and the Tribunal's subsequent awards in the SCC arbitration).\n\n447.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' submissions relating to the risk of double recovery and their undertaking not to pursue such recovery are irrelevant. The Respondent also says that the Claimants' claims in this arbitration relating to breaches of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA are inadmissible because they seek relief from the same harm which has now been fully repaired.468\n\nRespondents' Observations on Quantum, pp. 1-2. Answer in SCC Case No. V2017/098, dated 14 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26; Answer in SCC Case No. V2017/097, dated 14 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. The Respondent also referred to the Respondents' Submission on Costs, in which they took the position that the Claimants' multiplication of claims was abusive and had compelled the Respondents to expend inordinate time and resources to the defend duplicative contract and treaty claims. See Respondents' Submission on Costs, dated 16 January 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 10-15.\n\n448.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' position that its objection to admissibility was made late, the Respondent refers to the Respondents' Answers submitted in the SCC arbitration, in which they objected that Gardabani and Silk Road had also submitted a request for arbitration before ICSID based on the same facts and seeking relief for essentially the same harm pursued by Gardabani, Telasi and Inter RAO. In their Answers, the Respondents alleged that the multiplication of proceedings was an abuse of process intended to maximize pressure on the Government in an attempt to induce the NERC to grant the Khrami Companies' and Telasi's tariff adjustment applications then before it. In addition, it says that the Respondents' Observations were made in response to the Tribunal's invitation to the Parties to comment on the effect of the Partial Award on Liability on this arbitration and that the Claimants have had the opportunity to make submissions in response to its objection.\n\n449.\n\nTherefore, Gardabani's and Silk Road's treaty claims seeking relief for the same harm as the contract-based claims in the SCC arbitration are inadmissible.469\n\nThe Respondent also says that to the extent the Tribunal finds that treaty claims relating to breaches of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA are admissible, then its Counter-Claim in this arbitration for its share of the TIA would also be admissible for the same reasons.\n\n450.\n\nThe Respondent also submitted that the breaches of contract identified in the Partial Award on Liability do not amount to breach of its treaty obligations since it complied with all of these. With respect to the alleged breaches of the Umbrella Clause in the BIT, the Respondent submitted, *inter alia*, that the 2013 Memorandum and Khrami SPA contain exclusive dispute resolution clauses which were available to, and invoked by, the Claimants. Therefore, there can be no breach of the Umbrella Clause. The Tribunal considers this jurisdictional argument separately, below, where it addresses the Umbrella Clause claims on their merits.\n\n**2. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nIn their observations on the Partial Award, dated 14 May 2021 (the \"Claimants' Observations on Quantum\"), the Claimants submitted that while there is significant overlap between the Claimants' cases in the contract and treaty arbitrations, the cases are not identical. In this regard, they say that: the cases have different legal bases; there are differences in the relevant factual allegations; and, in relation to the distribution business conducted by Telasi, there are different Claimants (Inter RAO and Telasi in the SCC arbitration and Silk Road in the ICSID Arbitration). Therefore, the Claimants say that the claims pursued by Gardabani and Silk Road under the BIT in this arbitration are different and separate from the contractual rights of Gardabani and Telasi/Inter RAO and must be resolved and protected by a separate award. The Claimants say that it was a key element of their agreement to coordinate the two arbitrations that the Tribunal would render two separate awards in order to ensure that Silk Road's and Gardabani's rights under the BIT and the ICSID Convention would be preserved notwithstanding the coordination of the arbitrations. The Claimants submitted that any risk of overcompensation is mitigated by their undertaking not to seek double recovery of the amounts awarded by the Tribunal.470\n\nClaimants' Observations on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n452.\n\nIn their response to the Respondents' submissions of 23 June 2021, the Claimants submitted that the Partial Award on Liability only established liability under the relevant contracts and no compensation was ordered, and none has since been paid. Therefore, no harm will have been remedied until the Respondents actually pay compensation to the Claimants in the SCC arbitration.471 On this basis, the Claimants say that the award in *OTMTI v. Algeria* does not support the Respondent's position since, in that case, a shareholder below the claimant in the ownership chain had previously pursued arbitration under a different treaty in respect of the same underlying measures. The parties to that earlier arbitration settled their dispute through the sale to the host State of shares in the local Algerian company that was the subject of the arbitration.472 As a result, the harm suffered by the parent company, OTMTI, was remedied and it no longer had a claim to satisfy.473\n\nClaimants' letter of 2 July 2021, p. 1.\n\n*Id*., pp. 1-2.\n\n*Id.*, p. 1.\n\n453.\n\nFurther, and in any event, the Claimants submitted that a remedy ordered by the Tribunal in the SCC arbitration would not \"undo\" the Respondents' wrongful conduct nor render Gardabani and Silk Road's ICSID claims moot. According to the Claimants, the Respondents' breaches of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum harmed Gardabani and Silk Road and also violated their rights as qualifying investors under the BIT. They also say that payment of compensation by the Respondents following the Tribunal's Final Award in the SCC Arbitration will not change this. According to the Claimants, they are entitled to all available remedies for the Respondent's violation of the BIT, including: declarations that the Respondent violated the BIT; orders for monetary compensation for harm caused by treaty breaches; and an award that is enforceable pursuant to the ICSID Convention.474\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 June 2021, p. 2.\n\n454.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the award in *OTMTI v. Algeria* suggests that shareholders and companies in which they hold a stake cannot advance separate cases under separate instruments with respect to the same underlying conduct. They say that any suggestion in this regard would be contrary to prevailing practice.475\n\nClaimants' letter of 2 July 2021, p. 2. The Claimants refer to the decisions in *CME Czech Republic BV v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, dated 13 September 2001, CL-0019, \u00b6 419; *Flemingo DutyFree Shop Private Limited v. Republic of Poland,* PCA Case No. 2014-11, Award, dated 12 August 2016, CL-0132, \u00b6\u00b6 337-342.\n\n455.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's argument that the potential for overlapping awards renders the claims in the ICSID Arbitration inadmissible, the Claimants say that double recovery has nothing to do with admissibility. Instead, the Claimants say that admissibility concerns whether a claim is ripe for adjudication and otherwise capable of being resolved by a tribunal.476 Further, and in any event, addressing the possibility of double recovery is not new and has been addressed by other tribunals. In this case, the Claimants say that any concern is mitigated since they have undertaken not to seek compensation beyond the extent of the total harm caused.\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 June 2021, p. 2. The Claimants refer to *Abaclat and others (formerly Giovanna A. Beccara and others) v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/05, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, dated 4 August 2011, CL-0225, \u00b6 247; *Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Liability, 29 December 2014, CL-0226, \u00b6 180. The Claimants referred to the *HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic* Award which states: \"[double recovery] is a matter concerning the remedy rather than the claim. It is not a bar to the admissibility of a claim \u2013 unless, perhaps, it arises as an aspect of an argument based upon the principle of *res judicata*, which is not the case here. To the extent there may be a possibility of double recovery, that is a matter to be taken into account in the context of the need to prove and to quantify loss, and in the drafting of any [o]rder by the [t]ribunal. The [t]ribunal accordingly rejects this objection to the admissibility of the claim\".\n\n456.\n\nThe Claimants say that separating issues of admissibility from concerns relating to double recovery is particularly important in this case where the Parties agreed from the outset that the SCC and ICSID Arbitrations would be closely coordinated but would result in separate awards. They say this agreement was based on both sides' full knowledge that the facts underlying the treaty and contract cases were very similar and that the awards would address overlapping harms. In addition, the Respondent's defence on the basis of admissibility comes late and violates the Parties' agreement to coordinate these arbitrations and render two separate awards as well as the terms of Procedural Order No. 1 which required the Respondents to advance their full positive defence in their Counter-Memorial.477\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 June 2021, p. 3; Procedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 14.2; Claimants' letter of 2 July 2021, p. 2. The Claimants note that the objections relating to multiplication of proceedings and abusive process raised in the Respondents' Answers submitted in the SCC arbitration were not maintained after the Parties agreed to coordinate the proceedings in the two arbitrations. They say the fact that the Tribunal requested comments in relation to the effect of the Partial Award on the ICSID arbitration does not change the fact that they were required to advance that position in their Counter-Memorial.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, its decisions in the Partial Award on Liability, the subsequent Partial Awards on Damages and the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration do not render Silk Road's and Gardabani's claims under the BIT in this arbitration inadmissible.\n\n458.\n\nIn considering the Respondent's objection to the admissibility of the tariff-related claims in this arbitration, the Tribunal finds it helpful to summarize the background relating to the commencement of the arbitrations and their coordination.\n\n459.\n\nOn 9 June 2017, Inter RAO and Telasi filed a Request for Arbitration against the Government of Georgia for breach of the 2013 Memorandum (SCC Arbitration V2017/098). On the same date, Gardabani submitted a Request for Arbitration against the Government of Georgia, the MOE and the SSB for breach of the Khrami SPA (SCC Arbitration V2017/097). The Respondents in those arbitrations requested an extension for the filing of their Answers, which was granted until 14 August 2017.\n\n460.\n\nOn 4 August 2017, Gardabani and Silk Road submitted a Request for Arbitration against the Government of Georgia in these ICSID proceedings. In their Request, they referred to Gardabani's and Inter RAO's and Telasi's Requests for Arbitration filed with the SCC and acknowledged that while these arose out of the same facts as their claims in these proceedings, the SCC arbitrations were commenced under the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum, respectively.478\n\nGardabani's and Silk Road's Request for Arbitration, dated 4 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 76.\n\n461.\n\nOn 14 August 2017, the Respondents in the SCC arbitration, Georgia, the MOE and the SSB, submitted their Answers to the Requests in both arbitrations. In their Answers, the Respondents stated that they would address the factual and legal bases of the claims in the Requests for Arbitration at a later stage once they had had the opportunity to consider fully the claims as well as those in the ICSID proceedings. The Respondents went on to set out their preliminary position that the claims against them did not reflect a genuine dispute and were not ripe for submission to arbitration. They stated that the Claimants were seeking to use the arbitral process to put pressure on the Georgian authorities in hope of securing a favourable outcome in pending applications requesting the NERC to adjust their tariffs. The Respondents also submitted that Gardabani's and Silk Road's Request for Arbitration in these ICSID proceedings was based on the same facts as those at issue in the SCC arbitrations and sought relief for essentially the same alleged harm. According to them, the multiplication of arbitration proceedings relating to essentially the same dispute reflected a strategy of harassment which constituted an abuse of process. In addition, the Respondents alleged that the commencement of multiple proceedings was prejudicial to Georgia in that it would be required to defend multiple sets of clams before different tribunals in different fora and incur duplicative costs.479\n\n*E.g.*, Claimants' Request for Arbitration in the SCC Arbitration V2017/097, dated 30 March 2019, at Section V; Respondents' Answer in SCC Arbitration V2017/097, dated 14 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 15-26.\n\n462.\n\nIn their Answers to the Requests for Arbitration, the Respondents requested the consolidation of the two SCC arbitrations.480 The Claimants subsequently agreed and the SCC consolidated the two SCC arbitrations into SCC Case No. V2017/097.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 15-26.\n\n463.\n\nSubsequently, the Parties agreed to coordinate the consolidated SCC arbitration with this ICSID Arbitration. By way of their Agreement on Coordination, dated 14 February 2018, the Parties agreed that while the two arbitrations remained separate proceedings, a single tribunal would hear all claims. The two proceedings were to share a single evidentiary record, a single set of briefings and a single hearing and unified procedural timetable. However, the Tribunal was required to render two separate awards.481\n\nAgreement on Coordination, dated 14 February 2018.\n\n464.\n\nThe Parties subsequently agreed that a new arbitration would be commenced to resolve the disputes previously the subject of consolidated SCC Case No. V2017/097, which would be coordinated with the ICSID Arbitration as provided for in the Parties' Agreement on Coordination. On 30 March 2018, the Claimants submitted their new Request for Arbitration in the SCC Arbitration, and on 10 April 2018, the Respondents submitted their Answer. In their respective Request for Arbitration and Answer, the Parties referred to and incorporated their submissions in the original Requests for Arbitration and Answers in SCC Arbitration 2017/097 and SCC Arbitration 2017/098. They also referred to their Agreement on Coordination.\n\n465.\n\nPursuant to the Agreement on Coordination and Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties submitted pleadings and evidence addressing the claims in the SCC Arbitration and in the ICSID Arbitration. Throughout the course of these pleadings (including counterclaims) and the hearing, the Respondents did not repeat or otherwise address the preliminary position relating to an abuse of process and duplication of costs flowing from the commencement of proceedings before the SCC and ICSID. Nor was any objection relating to admissibility made. The merits of the Parties' claims and counterclaims were fully pleaded and addressed at the hearing. The Respondents first raised their objection to admissibility in their Observations of 14 May 2021.\n\n466.\n\nAlthough the Respondents initially objected that the commencement of the ICSID Arbitration advancing treaty claims on the same facts as those at issue in the SCC arbitrations and sought relief for essentially the same alleged harm amounted to an abuse of process, this objection was not pursued. It appears that the Parties agreed to coordinate the two arbitrations in order to avoid conducting two separate proceedings in parallel and reduce unnecessary duplication and costs. However, while the Parties' Agreement on Coordination provided for one single procedure and set of briefings, it specified that the two arbitrations would remain separate proceedings and required the Tribunal to issue separate awards in respect of the contractual claims in the SCC Arbitration and the BIT in the ICSID Arbitration. Although the overlap of damages claimed by the Claimants in the two arbitrations was plain from the outset, and in particular from the Claimants' Memorial on the merits, no objection relating to jurisdiction or the admissibility of claims in this arbitration was raised by the Respondents. In these circumstances, it appears that the Parties expected the Tribunal to render awards on the merits of the claims in each of the two separate arbitrations.\n\n467.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's findings in the SCC Arbitration, the Respondent says that Gardabani's and Silk Road's claims in this arbitration under the BIT seek relief for the same harm as, and are entirely duplicative of, the contractual claims brought by Telasi, Inter RAO and Gardabani under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA in the SCC Arbitration. They say that if the harm incurred by one entity in a corporate chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, claims brought by companies higher up in the same corporate chain are made whole as well and their claims are inadmissible to the extent that these relate to derivative losses, rather than personal losses. According to the Respondent, the Partial Award on Liability (and, subsequently, the Partial Awards on Damages and Final Award in the SCC Arbitration) fully remedies the tariff-related losses claimed by Gardabani and Silk Road. Since the Tribunal has found that the Respondents must compensate Gardabani, Telasi and Inter RAO for the losses suffered by them, the fact that the Tribunal had not settled the precise amount of the loss suffered by the Claimants is irrelevant.\n\n468.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the conduct that led to the violations of the BIT and their contractual rights at Georgian law and the harm suffered are largely the same.482 They also provided a single calculation of losses flowing from the breaches of contract and the tariff-related breaches of the BIT. Nevertheless, the Claimants say that the claims in the SCC Arbitration and this Arbitration are separate and distinct. They say that the Respondents' conduct breached both the Claimants' rights under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and also Gardabani's and Silk Road's rights as qualifying investors under the BIT. The Claimants say that the rights and obligations on which they rely are not just contractual, but derive from the resolutions adopted by the NERC to implement the Parties' agreements, which imposed separate obligations on the state. They say that there are fundamental differences between the contractual and BIT claims.483\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 282.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 132:12-133:25.\n\n469.\n\nWith respect to the FET claims, the Claimants say that these are not coextensive with breach of contract. They argue that even if the Tribunal were to find no contractual breach, there could still be a breach of the FET obligation as a result of the Respondents' conduct which they allege was erratic, non-transparent and unpredictable.484 With respect to the impairment claims, the Claimants say that the Respondent's failure to apply the tariff regimes applicable to Telasi and the Khrami Companies was unreasonable and arbitrary as it was not reasonably based on a rational policy objective, independent of the Claimants' expectations.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 132:25-135:24.\n\n470.\n\nWith respect to the claims relating to the umbrella clause in the BIT, the Claimants say that Silk Road and Gardabani have rights which are independent of the companies in which they own shares. Further, they say that the obligations on which they rely are not only the contractual obligations flowing from the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. In addition, the Claimants say the resolutions implementing those Agreements imposed obligations on the State, which they say were disregarded.485\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 132:3-132:24.\n\n471.\n\nIn the SCC Arbitration, Inter RAO's and Telasi's claims are contractual in nature alleging breaches of various provisions of the 2013 Memorandum by the Government of Georgia and the Partnership Fund. Gardabani's claims are against the Government of Georgia, the MOE and the SSB for breach of various provisions of the Khrami SPA.\n\n472.\n\nFor present purposes, the Claimants' claims in this ICSID Arbitration can be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) FET: Georgia breached the FET standard by frustrating Gardabani's and Silk Road's legitimate expectations which were based on the express terms of the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum and, in the case of Silk Road, in the series of written agreements from the 1998 SPA to the 2013 Memorandum. The Claimants say that they were entitled to expect that the explicit obligations undertaken in those Agreements would be respected. In addition, the Claimants maintain that the legitimate expectations were based on oral and written representations made by Georgia as well as the NERC resolutions adopted to implement the tariff regimes agreed to in the Agreements between the Parties.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants say that Georgia acted irrationally and in a non-transparent manner such that they were unable to discern the regulatory environment in which they were to operate and to implement a commercial strategy.\n\n(b) The Claimants also bring three supplemental claims which are unrelated to the tariff-related claims under the Agreements with the Parties. It is common ground that these claims are not affected by the Respondents' inadmissibility objection.\n\n(c) Impairment: Georgia's refusal to abide by the terms of the 2011 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum was unreasonable and impaired the Claimants' investments. The Claimants say that Georgia's failure to carry out what it recognized to be the appropriate tariff regime falls within the meaning of \"unreasonable\" and \"arbitrary\" conduct.\n\n(d) Umbrella Clause: the Claimants say that Georgia failed to observe its contractual obligations contained in the Agreements and also failed to comply with the obligations or commitments contained in the Regulatory Framework established by the relevant NERC resolution. The Claimants say that Georgia breached the obligation or commitments contained in the Agreements and also its unilateral commitments arising from the NERC resolutions.\n\nThe Claimants also say that their claims under the umbrella clause are based on a violation of their rights protected by the BIT and are not contractual in nature. They say that Georgia breached Article 3(4) of the BIT when it resiled from the tariff terms applicable to Telasi under NERC Resolution No. 3 and to the Khrami Companies under NERC Resolution No. 5.\n\n473.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Claimants pursue claims that their alleged rights as investors under the BIT have been breached. While there is considerable overlap between the facts and the damages claimed in the SCC Arbitration and this Arbitration, the claims in the two arbitrations are separate, having separate legal bases and different applicable laws under which the conditions of liability are different. This difference between international law claims under bilateral investment treaties and contractual claims has often been recognised by investment tribunals. In this regard, the annulment committee in the *Vivendi I* case stated as follows:\n\n*98. In a case where the essential basis of the claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract\u2026*\n\n*101. On the other hand, where \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard. At most, it might be relevant \u2013 as a municipal law will often be relevant \u2013 in assessing whether there has been a breach of treaty.*\n\n*102. In the Committee's view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by an actual court. In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.*486\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, dated 3 July 2002 (\"***Vivendi I***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.\n\n474.\n\nIn the resubmitted proceedings in the *Vivendi* case (*Vivendi II*), the tribunal held as follows:\n\n*Whether there is a breach of contract or a breach of the Treaty involves two different inquiries. Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate to a breach of municipal contract. Rather, they set an independent standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract; it may also breach a treaty at the same time it breaches a contract. And, in the latter case it is permissible for the [t]ribunal to consider such alleged contractual breaches, not for the purposes of determining whether a party has incurred liability under domestic law, but to the extent necessary to analyze and to determine whether there has been a breach of the Treaty. In doing so, the [t]ribunal would in no way be exercising jurisdiction over the contract, it would simply be taking into account the parties behaviour under and in relation to the terms of the contract in determining whether there has been a breach of distinct standard of international law, as reflected by Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT.*487\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, CL-0021(\"***Vivendi II***\"), \u00b6 7.3.10. *See also*, *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016 (\"***Crystallex v. Venezuela***\"), CL-0024, \u00b6\u00b6 479-482.\n\n475.\n\nThe Claimants have commenced arbitrations in respect of both their alleged contractual rights under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and their international law rights under the BIT. While the contractual agreements between Inter RAO, Telasi, Gardabani and Georgia, (and others), play an important role in the relationship between the Parties, the Claimants do not pursue claims for breach of contract in this arbitration. Rather, they claim breaches of various aspects of Article 3 of the BIT in relation to Georgia's conduct. While the contracts between the Parties, and their breach, are relevant facts in this arbitration, they are not its subject and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine any contractual disputes of the Parties in this ICSID Arbitration.\n\n476.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this distinction between contractual rights and rights protected by international law under investment treaties distinguishes the award in *OTMTI v. Algeria* on which the Respondent relies.488 In that case, three separate notices of dispute under different bilateral investment treaties were submitted by companies in the same corporate chain. The tribunal found that the three notices complained of the same measures taken by the state and gave notice of the same dispute.489 The tribunal found that in the circumstances of that case, the claims were inadmissible as the claimant parent company and controlling shareholder had caused their subsidiary company to crystalize the dispute, in respect of their international law rights at the level of the direct investor.\n\n*OTMTI v. Algeria*.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 488-489.\n\n477.\n\nThe tribunal went on to find that the parent company was seeking reparation for the same losses claimed by its subsidiary, the direct investor, which the parent sold after the submission of the subsidiary's notice of dispute. The claim brought by the direct investor was then settled by way of an agreement between the relevant state entity and the subsidiary as well as the third-party purchaser of the subsidiary from the parent company. The tribunal found that the parent company's attempt to bring a claim under the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and Algeria in respect of the same state measures subject of the other arbitrations under different bilateral investment treaties was inadmissible and amounted to an abuse of rights.490\n\n*Id*.*,* \u00b6\u00b6 518, 524-526, 538, 542-548.\n\n478.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the circumstances of this case are different from the peculiar circumstances in the *OTMTI* case. As indicated above, Inter RAO, Telasi and Gardabani notified the Respondents of disputes under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and commenced arbitrations before the SCC in June 2017. Subsequently, Gardabani and Silk Road notified the Respondent of a dispute under the BIT in August 2017.\n\n479.\n\nA review of these requests for arbitration and the Parties' subsequent pleadings indicates that it was clear from the outset that the Claimants were pursuing remedies in the SCC and ICSID Arbitrations on the basis of largely the same facts and that the relief pursued would overlap. After the submission of the Respondents' Answers in the SCC Arbitrations, in which they alleged the proceedings were duplicative and an abuse of process, the Parties agreed to coordinate the arbitrations and addressed the claims in the two arbitrations on their merits without further objection from the Respondents. In these circumstances, it appears that the Parties addressed the concerns raised by the Respondents and were content to proceed with coordinated, separate arbitrations and the issuance of separate awards in each case. The fact that the Tribunal has found liability in respect of the Claimants' contractual claims and awarded damages to the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration does not, in its view, affect the admissibility of the Claimants' separate claims under the BIT in this ICSID Arbitration.\n\n480.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered that since the Claimants have presented only one calculation of damages of their tariff-related claims, in respect of which the Tribunal has made a series of findings after the submission of several joint expert reports, it is unlikely that the Tribunal could find a greater measure of damages in respect of those claims in this arbitration than in the SCC Arbitration. However, the claims in the two arbitrations are different and as discussed above, Georgian law and the BIT set independent standards such that Georgia could breach the BIT without breaching either relevant contract and vice versa. Further, as the Claimants point out, the enforcement and challenge regimes applicable to international commercial and investment treaty awards is different. While it is true that any award the Claimants could obtain in respect of their tariff-related claims in this arbitration will not exceed damages awarded to the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration, this does not render the tariff-related claims inadmissible in this arbitration.\n\n481.\n\nThe issue of possible double compensation is commonly encountered in domestic and international jurisprudence. In the Tribunal's view, it is a question of remedy and is appropriately can be adequately addressed as such. The Tribunal has taken note of the Claimants' undertaking not to seek compensation beyond the extent of the total harm they have suffered and can make provision to avoid double recovery in its award.\n\n482.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that it should address the tariff-related claims at issue in this arbitration, together with the Supplemental Claims, on the merits. Accordingly, the Respondents' objection that the Claimants' tariff-related claims in this arbitration are inadmissible is dismissed.491\n\nAs stated previously, the Tribunal will address later in this Award the Respondents' argument that the Claimants cannot invoke the Umbrella Clause provision in Article 3(4) of the BIT and that the Tribunal should decline to exercise its jurisdiction in that respect on the basis of the dispute resolution clauses contained in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nArticle 3(1) BIT provides:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals. Each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical protection and security.*492\n\nGeorgia-Netherlands BIT, CL-0003, Art. 3.\n\n**1. Scope of the FET standard and Legitimate Expectations**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. **The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThe Claimants note that \"fair and equitable treatment\" is not defined in the BIT and submit that the essence of this standard is fairness. The Claimants say that this standard has been recognized consistently to include transparency, consistency, stability, predictability, good faith, legitimate expectations that an investor held when it invested, and a stable legal and business environment.493 Further, according to the Claimants, the State must refrain from arbitrary conduct (actions that lack a reasonable relationship to a legitimate policy goal), observe due process through candour in its administrative processes and transparency, and provide advance notice of acts that will affect investors' legal and property rights.494\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 243-247; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 160-165. *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Argentina* where the tribunal found the respondent state to have acted unfairly by changing the regulatory rules and altering the economic basis for tariffs after the investments were made despite the fact that the measures were taken in response to an economic crisis and that no tariff contract or promise of stabilisation was present in that case.496\n\nTr.

The Claimants argue that the Respondent's reliance on *Waste Management* is similarly misplaced because NAFTA's minimum standard of treatment was restricted by the Free Trade Commission to the customary international law on the treatment of aliens.\n\n*Crystallex v.

Costa Rica* nor *Cargill v. Mexico* support the Respondent's argument that a violation of FET requires a deliberate reversal or repudiation of the State's policy objectives and purpose because the relevant parts of those awards related to the threshold for arbitrariness that could violate FET.

Georgia refers to the following passage from *Waste Management*:\n\n*The minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.*506\n\n*See* sources cited at Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 331-332, fns 665-672.\n\n*Waste Management v.

Therefore, the State's right to regulate must be afforded a reasonable margin of appreciation in taking regulatory measures before being held to account.509 The Respondent says that in cases of this nature, the relevant tariffs must cover all operating expenses, maintenance expenses and service amortization, and provide a reasonable return to investors. It says that this essential term must be (and was) upheld even in a changing economic climate.510 The Respondent says the Claimants must also demonstrate that there has been a deliberate repudiation of the purpose of the State's policy. Further, the Tribunal must consider the remedies made available to investors by the State and their use of them to try to correct the application of the regulatory framework.511\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 35-343; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 334-336, 339; *Teinver v.

Costa Rica* (RL-0018), \u00b6 527.\n\n493.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the fair and equitable treatment standard is closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations.512 It submits that in order to be protected, the expectations must be objective in nature and grounded in the legal order of the host state.513 Accordingly, the analysis must take into account the state's sovereign power to regulate in the public interest and any evolution in the regulatory framework. The Respondent asserts that a contractual arrangement with the State is not a sufficient basis for legitimate expectations that the contract will not be impacted by subsequent changes in the law. Further, on the facts of this case, the Respondent submits that Appendix 2 of the 2013 Memorandum provides the benchmark, which was met and exceeded, for the Parties' expectations at the time that agreement was concluded.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 338.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n494.\n\nThe Respondent submits that investment tribunals have rejected claims of breach of an investor's legitimate expectations in the absence of specific commitments or representations in the relevant legal, regulatory or contractual regime that the State would not introduce regulatory changes affecting, e.g., contractual price arrangements.514 In this regard, the Respondent referred to the awards in *AES v. Hungary*515 and *Electrabel v. Hungary*516 and submitted that the circumstances in those cases were remarkably similar to those at issue here.517 The Respondent notes that those cases related to long-term power purchase agreements that provided for the terms of electricity pricing and included a change-in-law provision.518 The Respondent says that the tribunals in those cases found that the change-in-law provision in the power purchase agreements meant that there was no legitimate expectation that the pricing provided for in the agreements would continue free from any pricing intervention from the Hungarian Government.519\n\n*AES Summit* *Generation Limited and AES Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft. v.

Georgia says that there were no assurances given to the Claimants that regulated pricing would not be introduced prior to the expiry of the 2013 Memorandum. Further, the Parties included a change-in-law provision in the 2013 Memorandum.520 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that there could not have been any legitimate expectation that the pricing under the 2013 Memorandum would continue to apply. Further, the regulatory changes were reasonable.521\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n496.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in order to be protected, legitimate expectations must be grounded in the legal order of the host state (the circumstances in which the investor chose to invest), as opposed to unilaterally established by one of the parties. The investor's legitimate expectation of a fair return on its investment must be balanced against the right to regulate in the public interest.522 The Respondent maintains that the Claimants' allegation of a legitimate expectation based on the written agreements must fail because the determination of Telasi's tariffs under the 2014 Methodology was well within what the Claimants expected, or reasonably should have expected, when they signed the 2013 Memorandum. Further, the forecasted level of profitability, set out in the 2013 Memorandum, was also achieved.523\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 338-339; Rudoff Dolzer, Fair and Equitable Treatment: A Key Standard in Investment, The International Lawyer, RL-0019, p. 16; *Ulysseas, Inc. v.

The Respondent says that there is no factual or legal basis for any of the Claimants' allegations related to the failure to provide transparent or consistent treatment.525\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 372.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 356; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 372-375.\n\nc. **The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT provides that the Respondent shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the Netherlands, in this case Silk Road and Gardabani. Unlike other treaties, the BIT makes no reference to the minimum standard of treatment at international law nor to treatment \"in accordance with principles of international law\" or any similar formulation. As has been found by other arbitral tribunals, the Tribunal believes that the FET standard embodied in the BIT constitutes an autonomous treaty standard which is not limited to the minimum standard of treatment at customary international law.526\n\n*Crystallex v. Venezuela*, CL-0024, \u00b6 530; *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, CL-0052, \u00b6\u00b6 294-295.\n\n499.\n\nMany arbitral tribunals have considered the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" in accordance with the rules of interpretation set out in the VCLT and identified a number of elements of the standard. These include the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations, protection against arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, the obligation to act transparently and with due process and good faith.527 While the formulation of the FET standard may vary between awards, there appears to be a consensus that these elements constitute the core of the FET standard.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, CL-0052*,* \u00b6\u00b6 297-309; *Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 30 November 2012, \u00b6 7.74, (FET \"comprises several elements, including an obligation to act transparently and with due process; and to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework adversely affecting its investment\"); *Crystallex v. Venezuela,* \u00b6\u00b6 538-543, CL-0024.\n\n500.\n\nCompliance with the FET standard must be assessed in light of all of the facts and circumstances of a particular case.528 Further, the standard is an objective one and does not permit an arbitral tribunal to decide in equity or to second-guess government decision making.529\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, CL-0052, \u00b6 298; *Mondev v. USA*, RL-0011 , \u00b6 118.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, CL-0052, \u00b6 284.\n\n501.\n\nWith respect to the difference between the Parties with regard to the threshold for a finding of a breach of FET and whether a respondent state's conduct must be found to be \"seriously improper\", the Tribunal does not accept that the state's conduct must be outrageous or egregious or amount to bad faith in order to breach the standard. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the *Crystallex* tribunal which referred to the award in *Mondev:* \"[t]o the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or be egregious. In particular, a state may treat a foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith\".530 Nevertheless, a breach of the FET standard requires \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective\".531 The infringement of the FET standard is a serious matter involving a significant threshold such that the respondent state's conduct is sufficiently serious to fall below the required standard of transparency, stability and predictability.532 As will be discussed below in the context of legitimate expectations, a state will not breach its obligation to treat investors fairly and equitably if it changes its laws in a legitimate exercise of its regulatory authority, absent a commitment not to do so. Further, a breach by a state of a contractual obligation owed to an investor will not, in itself, necessarily amount to a breach of FET.\n\n*Crystallex v.

The Claimants' Claims of Breach of Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment in a number of ways. First, they say that the Respondent failed to provide both Silk Road and Gardabani with a stable legal environment that they had the right to expect and frustrated their legitimate expectations reflected in the 2013 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA, the 2011 Memorandum and the NERC's Resolutions No. 5 (2011) and No. 3 (2013). The Claimants also allege that the Respondent failed to ensure a transparent and predictable legal framework for their investments. The Tribunal addresses first Silk Road's and then Gardabani's primary claims and then the Supplemental Claims relating to Telasi's purchase portfolio volatility, the diversion of the Khrami Companies' electricity and sales to third-parties and Telasi's cost of new connections.\n\na. **Silk Road's Investments (Telasi)**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**i. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThe Claimants claim that the Respondent frustrated its legitimate expectation of the stable and legal business environment provided for in the 2013 Memorandum which specifically set Telasi's long-term tariffs and the conditions of their adjustment until 2025. They say that this was the basic expectation at the heart of the 2013 Memorandum in exchange for which Silk Road agreed to the four-year tariff reduction requested by the Respondent. They say this was the stable business environment that Silk Road legitimately expected, but that the Respondent refused to abide by that agreement. The Claimants say that beginning in 2014, the Respondent refused to adjust Telasi's tariffs to account for the depreciation of the GEL and then, commencing in September 2015, set Telasi's tariffs based on the 2014 Methodology rather than the long-term tariffs fixed in the 2013 Memorandum. In addition, the Claimants say that the Respondent refused to increase Consumer Tariffs to compensate for the shortfall against Telasi's RGR for 2017.533\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 254; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 121-122.\n\n504.\n\nSilk Road says its expectations were based upon Telasi's relationship with Georgia embodied in the series of agreements from the 1998 Telasi SPA to the 2013 Memorandum. Silk Road says that the Respondent represented that Telasi's tariffs would be set in accordance with the Agreement, and not subject to the discretion of the NERC. It says that when a State expressly assumes specific legal obligations, in this case in the series of agreements leading up to and including the 2013 Memorandum, the investor is justified in expecting that those obligations will be complied with.\n\n505.\n\nSilk Road says that the Respondent specifically committed to the regime by which Telasi's tariffs would be set and adjusted in accordance with the tariff-related provisions of the 2013 Memorandum.534 The Claimants note that the 2013 Memorandum was concluded in part to effect a temporary consumer tariff reduction, but that the parties agreed that previous tariff levels would be restored after 2016 and set in accordance with the 2013 Memorandum.535 They say that Silk Road expected Georgia to honour its commitment that Telasi's tariffs would be restored and that, otherwise, Telasi would not have agreed to reduce its tariffs as requested by the Government.536 Further, the Claimants say that Silk Road's continued investment under the 2013 Memorandum reflects that the Respondent was aware of Silk Road's reliance on the commitment and representations that Telasi's tariffs would be set and adjusted in accordance with the Memorandum.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 255; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 173.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 255; Tr.

Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 123:2-8.\n\n508.\n\nSilk Road also refers to the evidence of the discussions with the MOE commencing in September 2014 regarding the adjustment of Telasi's purchase portfolio to compensate for high electricity costs (WAPT) as also strengthening its expectations that Georgia would abide by the terms of the 2013 Memorandum. It says that in those discussions, the MOE accepted responsibility for increasing Telasi's tariffs under the 2013 Memorandum or compensating Telasi for excessive electricity purchase costs.541 Further, in July 2015 the Minister confirmed that Telasi's rights under the 2013 Memorandum would not be cancelled or nullified if Telasi filed a tariff adjustment application in the form requested by the NERC.542\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 179, Tr.

Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 123:19-24; Letter from Kaladze to Kobtsev, dated 21 July 2015, C-0064.\n\n509.\n\nSilk Road submits that Georgia violated its legitimate expectations as set out in the 2013 Memorandum by leaving the tariff-setting to the discretion of the NERC, which completely disregarded the agreed tariff regime. Silk Road says that the Respondent represented that Telasi's tariffs would be set in accordance with the Parties' agreement and would not be subject to the discretion of the NERC. It says that the Respondent specifically committed to the regime by which Telasi's tariffs would be set and adjusted and entered into a legal obligation in that regard. Therefore, it legitimately expected that the Respondent's commitment would be respected.543 Georgia's position that it lacked control over the electricity tariffs applicable to Telasi (and the Khrami Companies), taken for the first time after the 2013 Memorandum was entered into, undermined the predictability of the regulatory framework.544\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 255.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 267.\n\n510.\n\nThe Claimants do not take issue with the fact that the NERC is formally an independent regulator and they note that nothing in the legal regime changed to make anyone expect it to be more or less independent before or after 2014.545 However, the Claimants say that the way the NERC conducted itself over years of cooperation since 1998 was an important part of the expectations of the Inter RAO Group in coming to negotiate with the government for a tariff deal in 2013.546 Over the course of many years, the NERC set tariffs for Telasi and the Khrami Companies (and other investors) in accordance with tariff agreements entered into by the Government and without an independent review of tariff applications.547 The Claimants submit that, in fact, between 2006 and 2015 Telasi never made a tariff application to the NERC; its tariffs were automatically approved by the NERC when requested by the MOE in accordance with the tariff agreement in effect at the time.548 Therefore, the Claimants submit that the Government's decision in 2015 to renege on the tariff agreements, relying on the NERC's formal independence as an excuse for imposing the 2014 Methodology, was a breach of their legitimate expectations.549\n\nTr.

Day 7 (Claimants' Closing Statement), 31:22-32:24.\n\n513.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's position that Silk Road's legitimate expectations remained intact because Telasi was no worse off under the 2014 Methodology than it was under the 2013 Memorandum, the Claimants say that the Respondent's interpretation of the 2013 Memorandum is incorrect. According to the Claimants, there is no \"profitability cap\" under the 2013 Memorandum and there is no evidence that Silk Road's legitimate expectations were limited by the tariff figures contained in Appendix No. 2. Rather, Telasi's rights were expressly set out in Clauses 2.2 and 2.3 of the 2013 Memorandum which provided for the application of the long-term tariffs provided for in Clause 2.2 and the adjustment of those tariffs pursuant to Clause 2.3 of the 2013 Memorandum.552 The application of the 2014 Methodology pre-empted Telasi's contractual rights and reduced its tariffs and earnings under the 2013 Memorandum, making its position worse. Further, and in any event, the Claimants say that Silk Road invested in Telasi on the understanding that certain aspects of the business environment would be guaranteed by the agreements negotiated over the years with the Government. By discarding the tariff-related terms in the latest of those agreements, the 2013 Memorandum, the Respondent introduced unpredictability into Telasi's business which, by definition, made its position worse than under the terms of that Agreement.553\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 182.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 182.\n\n***(b) Transparency and Predictability***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the Respondent treated both Silk Road's and Gardabani's investments inconsistently, irrationally and non-transparently in breach of its obligation to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for their investments.554 The Claimants say that transparency and predictability require that the legal framework for an investor's obligations must be readily apparent and that any decisions affecting the investor can be traced to that legal framework. According to the Claimants, these principles required the Respondent to be transparent regarding its interpretation of the relevant agreements, the 2013 Memorandum (and the Khrami SPA), and seek to resolve the interpretation disputes with respect to them.555\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 183-185; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 124:5-126:3.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 184.\n\n515.\n\nRather than doing so, the Claimants say that the Respondent and the NERC contradicted themselves and each other at various times in their dealings with the Claimants. In this regard, the Claimants refer to: the MOE's inconsistency with respect to Telasi's claims for tariff adjustments commencing in September 2014, when it agreed to compensate Telasi for increases in its WAPT and then failing to do so; assuring Telasi that its rights under the 2013 Memorandum would be preserved if it were to file a tariff adjustment under the 2014 Methodology, and, shortly thereafter, the NERC applied the 2014 Methodology in disregard of the 2013 Memorandum; in May and August 2016, the NERC explained that it could not adjust Telasi's tariffs as requested under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA because it had no legal basis to apply the terms of those agreements, which was false; and, in 2016 the NERC told the Khrami Companies that the 2014 Methodology would necessarily apply if they sought a tariff adjustment, and then changed course the following year and applied the terms of the Khrami SPA rather than the 2014 Methodology.556\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 185; Tr. Day 1, 124:13-127:3; Tr. Day 7 (Claimants' Closing Statement), 246:16-247:1.\n\n516.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the NERC's position in 2015 and 2016 that it could not adjust either Telasi's or the Khrami Companies' tariffs as requested because the 2014 Methodology deprived the NERC of a legal basis to follow the 2013 Memorandum was false.557 They submit that the bespoke tariff agreements with the State had always been observed and the legal basis for doing so was Article 11(1) of the Energy Law and Resolution 170, which is also consistent with Article 1 of the Energy Law on promoting foreign investment.558 The Claimants say that in 2017, the NERC found a basis to implement the Khrami SPA, albeit incorrectly.559 The NERC's change in position with respect to the Khrami Companies \u2013 initially saying that the 2014 Methodology would apply if they sought a tariff adjustment and then, instead, applying the Khrami SPA \u2013 is another example of inconsistency. The Claimants allege that this behaviour was a further breach of Georgia's obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment through the undermining of the predictable regulatory framework.560\n\nTr.

The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nThe Respondent says it did not violate Silk Road's legitimate expectations or any obligation to act consistently and transparently.\n\n518.\n\nWith respect to legitimate expectations, the Respondent says that these must be established by reference to the legal regime in which an investor invests at the time the investment is made. The Respondent says that Silk Road has operated in Georgia since December 1998 when AES acquired a majority shareholding in Telasi pursuant to the Telasi SPA. The Respondent contests the Claimants' assertion that Silk Road has operated Telasi since that time on the understanding that certain aspects of the business environment would be guaranteed by government agreements. Rather, the Telasi SPA expressly provided that as of October 2008, Telasi's Distribution Tariffs would be \"calculated in co-operation with the NERC [\u2026] in accordance with Georgian Law\".561 Therefore, Silk Road could not have invested with the reasonable expectation that Telasi's operations would be outside the reach of the relevant regulatory framework. Insofar as the 2013 Memorandum is concerned, Silk Road could not have reasonably expected that its tariff provisions would apply without change until 2025 or that the NERC would not introduce new regulated tariffs until that date, because no such assurances were made.562\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 348; Telasi SPA, C-0001, Schedule 11, Clause 3.6. That provision reads, in part, as follows: \"After the initial 10-year period, ending on 30 September 2008, the **Specified Distribution Margin** will be calculated with effect from 1 October 2008 and may be calculated as frequently as every five years and thereafter, will be calculated in co-operation with the NERC and in accordance to Good Utility Practice, and is set in accordance with Georgian Law and the following principles\u2026\"\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 344-358; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 340-348.\n\n519.\n\nThe Respondent says that the facts of this case are very similar to those in the *AES v. Hungary* and *Electrabel v. Hungary* awards where the tribunals found that the contractual arrangements with the state were not a sufficient basis to provide a legitimate expectation that the contracts would not be affected by subsequent changes in law. The Respondent says there was nothing in the legal regime or in the 2013 Memorandum on which Silk Road could reasonably have based an expectation that no new regulated tariffs would be introduced before the expiry of the 2013 Memorandum.563\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 337-339, 354. The Respondent distinguishes the award in *Impregilo* relied upon by the Claimants to say that regulatory changes that alter fundamental aspects of the host state's contractual arrangements with a foreign investor violate the host state's obligation to act fairly and equitably. The Respondent says that the Tribunal in the *Impregilo* case found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation because the respondent in that case failed to restore the economic equilibrium in the claimant's concession agreement and not because of the introduction of the emergency law implementing the specification of tariffs. The Respondent notes that the tribunal in *Impregilo* stated that \"fair and equitable treatment cannot be designed to ensure the immutability of the order, the economic world or the social universe\" and that foreign investors cannot legitimately expect \"that the State will never modify the legal framework\". *See* Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 341-342 and the sources cited there.\n\n520.\n\nThe Respondent says that Silk Road knew that Telasi's tariffs would be set by the NERC, not by the Government, and that the NERC was under no obligation to set and adjust Telasi's tariffs in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Memorandum.564 Further, Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology, which exempted from its scope of application electricity companies with pre-existing tariff agreements with the Government and was still in force at the time the 2013 Memorandum was signed, could not have applied to the 2013 Memorandum since it applied only to tariff agreements pre-existing the adoption of the 2011 Methodology.565 The Respondent also says that, to Telasi's knowledge, the NERC retained its jurisdiction under Article 11.1 of the Law on Electricity to take into account transactions entered into by the State as it deemed appropriate.566 Therefore, the relevant legal regime gave the NERC discretion to take into account contractual tariff arrangements. The fact that it may have chosen not to apply the tariff-setting provisions of the existing Methodologies to the Claimants in the past did not in itself create a legitimate expectation that it would continue to do so in the future, irrespective of the evolving context.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 92-96, 349.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 349; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94; 2011 Methodology, CL-0081, Article 27.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 349-350.\n\n521.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the 2013 Memorandum has no stabilisation clause precluding legislative changes. Rather, it specifically deals with the Parties' rights and obligations should a change in law (e.g., the NERC's introduction of the 2014 Methodology) cause Inter RAO to be worse off compared to its expectations when the 2013 Memorandum was concluded.567 Silk Road therefore knew that Georgia might enact laws that could render the 2013 Memorandum tariffs unenforceable. Accordingly, the only expectation Silk Road could have had was the payment of compensation under Clause 5.2 should the tariffs set by the NERC make Telasi's financial situation worse than when the 2013 Memorandum was signed.568 The Respondent suggests that the Claimants insisted on including Clause 5.2 in the agreement so as to retain the right to obtain compensation from the Government precisely in the event the NERC's tariff decisions made Telasi's financial position worse than the forecasts at Appendix 2. Further, and in any event, the Respondent says Telasi far exceeded its expectations even after the implementation of the 2014 Methodology. In addition, Dr. Moselle confirmed that it would continue to do so up to 2025 because the Methodology guarantees a 4-5% profit margin similar to that provided in the 2013 Memorandum.569\n\n2013 Memorandum, R-0028, Clauses 5.2 \"change in law\", 6.3 \"renegotiation\".\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 345.\n\nMoselle I, \u00b6\u00b6 8.1-8.15.\n\n522.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent says Silk Road's legitimate expectation claim should be rejected because the determination of Telasi's tariffs under the 2014 Methodology was within what the Claimants expected (or ought to have expected) when they signed the 2013 Memorandum. Those expectations were reflected in the forecasts of key performance indicators, at Appendix 2 of the 2013 Memorandum. A comparison of the figures at Appendix 2 to Telasi's actual financial performance after the application of the 2014 Methodology indicates that Silk Road is not worse off since it earned a margin in excess of the 4-5% expected in the 2013 Memorandum.570\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 357; Moselle II, \u00b6\u00b6 2.20, 7.13-7.14, 7.16-7.19: Dr. Moselle says Telasi's revenues above its recognized costs are higher than forecasted in Appendix 2, 2013 Memorandum and that Telasi's average margin relative to its revenues net of commercial losses is higher than the 4-5% Reserve Revenue in the 2013 Memorandum.\n\n523.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that, under Georgian law, the NERC has full discretion to introduce regulated tariffs, and as such, was not required to apply the tariffs in the 2013 Memorandum. The Claimants knew this at the time when the 2013 Memorandum was concluded. The Respondent recalls that Silk Road (initially owned by AES at the time) has operated in Georgia since 1998 when it concluded the Telasi SPA. That agreement contemplated that, as of October 2008, Telasi's Distribution Tariffs would be calculated in co-operation with the NERC, in accordance with Georgian tariff-setting principles. Although the transitional regime in the 2011 Methodology exempted from its application electricity companies with pre-existing tariff arrangements with Georgia, because it was already in force at the time the 2013 Memorandum was signed, this exemption did not apply to the 2013 Memorandum. Accordingly, Silk Road did not invest with the expectation that Telasi would be outside the reach of the applicable regulatory framework, or that the NERC would wait a decade to apply the 2014 Methodology to Telasi, which is one of only three electricity distribution companies in Georgia. In this regard, Ms. Bachiashvili alleged that the Claimants were told during the negotiation process that the 2013 Memorandum tariffs would need to be agreed by the NERC.571\n\nBachiashvili I, \u00b6 21.\n\n524.\n\nThe Respondent says that while the NERC did not devise a new methodology before 2014, it always had the power to override the 2013 Memoranda's tariff provisions. Although the NERC chose not to apply the 2013 Memorandum to Silk Road until July 2015, this did not create a legitimate expectation that it would continue to do so, particularly when, at the time the 2013 Memorandum was concluded, the NERC was, to the Claimants' knowledge, in the process of updating and modernizing its tariff-setting methodology to bring it in line with European standards under the Twinning Initiative. The NERC publicly announced its plans to update its methodology along these lines on 26 October 2012, which was before the Claimants started negotiating the 2013 Memorandum.572 The Claimants attended the public consultations leading up to the adoption of the 2014 Methodology and did not express any reservations. The Respondent argues that the Claimants' participation shows they were aware that, going forward, their tariffs would be set under the new methodology, which would necessarily displace the 2013 Memorandum's tariff adjustment mechanisms. Thus, they could not have expected that Telasi would remain entitled to the tariffs and their adjustment as set out in the 2013 Memorandum.\n\nEC Press Releases, R-0030; Speech declaring that the NERC will develop \"incentive based tariff regulation and creating preconditions for its application\".\n\n525.\n\nGeorgia says it did not represent to Silk Road that Telasi would be exempted from the new tariff methodology. It points to the Government's refusal of Inter RAO's proposal to include the NERC as a contracting party to the 2013 Memorandum, which reflected Inter RAO's understanding of the NERC's exclusive competence over tariff-setting and the Government's corresponding lack of authority to compel the NERC to apply the 2013 Memorandum. Further, the 2013 Memorandum states that the Government will take the necessary measures \"within its authority\" to ensure adoption of the regulations required to implement the tariff provisions of the 2013 Memorandum, which is distinct from Inter RAO's proposed wording that the Government \"approve\" Telasi's tariffs.573 Finally, because the parties understood that only the NERC could fix tariffs, these are referred to in the 2013 Memorandum as \"indicative limit tariffs\" in Clause 2.2.1.\n\n2013 Memorandum, C-0034 / R-0028, Clause 1.5; compare to NERC's 2017 Annual Report, R-0002.\n\n***(b) Transparency and Predictability***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nWith respect to Silk Road's allegations that it failed to act transparently and consistently, the Respondent says that none of these have any basis.574 The Respondent says that the measures about which the Claimants complain were implemented in good faith on the basis of considerations set forth in the applicable laws and regulations in accordance with applicable procedure, ensured due process and were always amply motivated. It also says that the policy considerations underlying the measures in question were made clear and there is no basis to conclude that they were adopted for pretextual reasons.575\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 376-385.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 377.\n\n527.\n\nInsofar as the treatment of Telasi's request for adjustment of its tariffs is concerned, the Respondent says that although Telasi had no claim for an adjustment of its tariffs in 2014 and 2015 since its expectations had all been exceeded, the MOE attempted to address the Claimants' concerns about Telasi's WAPT and the depreciation of the GEL. It also offered to settle the Claimants' complaints on a commercial basis by relinquishing its share of the accumulated TIA. However, the Claimants rejected this good faith offer.576\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 378.\n\n528.\n\nWith respect to the alleged erratic and non-transparent manner in which the 2014 Methodology was implemented, the Respondent says that the record shows that Silk Road was aware that Telasi's tariffs would be set by the NERC and that the NERC was under no obligation to implement the contractual tariff arrangements in the 2013 Memorandum. Further, the Claimants knew that the NERC was in the process of updating its tariff-setting methodology to achieve EU standards. It says that the NERC's preliminary calculations of Telasi's tariffs under the 2014 Methodology were shared with Telasi before the 2014 Methodology was applied to Telasi's Tariff Application in September 2015.577 Further, the Respondent says that the NERC set Telasi's tariffs under the 2014 Methodology after a thorough and transparent tariff review process in compliance with Georgian Law and with Telasi's active participation. Finally, the NERC's decisions with respect to the setting of Telasi's tariffs were fully reasoned.578\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 379, 131-134. The exchanges relating to the adjustment of Telasi's tariffs under the 2014 Methodology occurred in April 2015 and following.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 379.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Silk Road has not demonstrated that at the time the 2013 Memorandum was concluded it had the legitimate expectation that Telasi's tariffs would be set and adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the Memorandum until 31 December 2025 without change. Rather, its expectation was that in the event of a change of legislation which made its position worse as compared to its position at the date of the signature of the 2013 Memorandum, the Respondent would compensate for all losses.\n\n530.\n\nThe relevant time at which to assess whether an investor has a legitimate expectation is at the time it makes its investment. Here, Silk Road first invested in Telasi in 1998 under the terms of the Telasi SPA when it purchased approximately 75% of Telasi's shares. The Telasi SPA contained a change of law clause which provided that for a period of 10 years the State would compensate AES Silk Road Holdings BV for certain changes of law.579 It set Silk Road's investment requirements and Distribution Tariffs until 30 September 2008. After that, the Telasi SPA provided that Telasi's specified Distribution Margin would be calculated every 5 years \"\u2026 in co-operation with the NERC and in accordance to Good Utility Practice, and set in accordance with Georgian Law\" and certain principles: Telasi's costs were anticipated with reference to international practices in regulated utility companies; a reasonable rate of return would be provided so that Telasi and its affiliates would achieve a fair and reasonable market-related return on Silk Road's initial and subsequent investments in Telasi; and, the need to hold Silk Road harmless for changes in exchange rates and inflation by way of periodic adjustments.580\n\nTelasi SPA, C-0001, Clause 20.\n\nTelasi SPA, C-0001, Schedule 11, Clause 3.6.\n\n531.\n\nAfter this, by way of the AES SPA, in 2003 RAO Nordic Oy AES sold its shares in AES Silk Road Holdings BV to Inter RAO.581\n\nAES SPA, dated 11 July 2003, C-0012. Subsequently, on 25 April 2008, RAO Nordic sold its shares in Silk Road and Gardabani to Inter RAO Holdings BV. *See* Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated 25 April 2008, C-0013.\n\n532.\n\nInter RAO then negotiated and concluded the 2007 and 2011 Memoranda, described above, with the Respondent. The 2013 Memorandum was concluded between Inter RAO, Telasi, Mtkvari and the Khrami Companies with the Government of Georgia and the Partnership Fund. As described above, the NERC implemented resolutions adopting the tariffs agreed between the Government and Inter RAO in these Memoranda. Then, in 2014 it adopted a new tariff-setting Methodology which it applied to Telasi's tariffs commencing in September 2015.\n\n533.\n\nSilk Road says that when the 2013 Memorandum was signed, it had an expectation that Telasi's tariffs would be set and adjusted in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Memorandum throughout the course of its entire term and were not subject to the discretion of the NERC. It says this expectation was based upon the previous series of agreements between Inter RAO and Georgia. It also says that during the course of the negotiation of the 2013 Memorandum, Georgia's representatives confirmed that the Memorandum was not to be overridden and the fact that the NERC was not a party to the Agreement would not affect its terms since the Government would ensure full implementation. Further, the NERC's resolutions, particularly Resolution No. 3 of 2013, confirmed its expectation that the Agreement, as negotiated, would be implemented. It also relies on the conduct of the MOE in discussions regarding Telasi's WAPT as confirming its expectation.\n\n534.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the foregoing does not demonstrate a clear, objective legitimate expectation that the tariff-setting and adjustment provisions of the 2013 Memorandum would apply without change for the term of the Memorandum. As described above, under the Telasi SPA of 2008, Telasi's tariffs were to be calculated in cooperation with the NERC in order to achieve a reasonable rate of return and hold Telasi harmless for changes in exchange rates and inflation. The bespoke Memoranda subsequently concluded by Inter RAO and Georgia were separate agreements which set a clean slate upon their entry into effect. In particular, the 2013 Memorandum specifically provided that it superseded any previous memoranda in their entirety.\n\n535.\n\nIn 2012, the MOE and the NERC had commenced the process of modernizing Georgia's tariff regulations to bring them into line with regulatory practices in the European Union. The Claimants were aware of this and attended some early information and discussion sessions. As the Tribunal found in the SCC Partial Award, at the time the 2013 Memorandum was signed, the Claimants had knowledge of the Twinning Initiative, which was intended to revise the NERC's tariff-setting methodology, and had some concern that this might apply to them and affect Inter RAO's activities in Georgia. It appears this was the reason that, in the negotiations leading to the 2013 Memorandum, the Claimants sought to add the NERC as a party and demanded the insertion of Clause 5.2 in the draft of the Memorandum. Although the details of the 2014 Methodology were not known at the time, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants, including Silk Road, had a concern that Georgia or the NERC could seek to change its legislation in the future and affect Telasi's tariffs. This concern appears to have been significant enough for the Claimants to seek to add the NERC as a party to the 2013 Memorandum and to ensure compensation by way of a new Clause 5.2.\n\n536.\n\nIn Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum, the Parties foresaw the possibility that a change in legislation could make Inter RAO's or any Inter RAO Group company's position worse as compared to the position at the date of the signature of the Memorandum. It is common ground between the Parties that a change or amendment of legislation includes changes in the NERC's regulatory resolutions. In the event such a change occurred, Clause 5.2 provided that the Government shall compensate for any losses. This clause was agreed in the context of the Government's demand that Telasi's tariffs would be reduced for a period of approximately 3.5 years and the Claimants' demand that Telasi be protected from the adverse effects of a change in regulation. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Clause 5.2 represents a specific commitment by the Government to compensate Inter RAO or any of the Inter RAO's Group companies operating in Georgia if their position under the newly agreed tariff provisions was made worse by a regulatory change. On this basis, the Claimants could legitimately expect that if a change in legislation negatively affected Telasi's position, they would be compensated by the Government for any losses.\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of the complex, technical provisions of the 2013 Memorandum in the SCC Arbitration indicates that determining whether Telasi's position had been adversely affected pursuant to Clause 5.2 was no easy matter. As the Tribunal noted in the SCC Partial Award on Liability, the terms of the 2013 Memorandum are complex and extensive submissions and evidence were required to determine how it should be interpreted. Further, the calculation of losses incurred by Telasi was particularly complex and required the submission of several joint expert reports. As a result, the Tribunal only recently determined in the SCC Awards that the conditions of Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum have been met and been in a position to assess losses in the SCC Arbitration.\n\n538.\n\nIn the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal determined the Claimants' contractual claims under the terms of the 2013 Memorandum and found that the Government was liable for the payment of compensation.582 In this arbitration, the Tribunal has found that the Government made a specific commitment to compensate for any losses caused by a change in legislation and that Silk Road had a legitimate expectation in that regard. The remaining question is whether the Government has breached that expectation in the circumstances of this case as it has evolved.\n\nSCC Partial Award on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 653, 795.\n\n539.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Silk Road's expectation of compensation is dependent on the finding that its position was made worse by a change in legislation and an assessment of what losses were suffered. When the issue of whether a qualifying change had occurred arose, the Government, as contracting party was entitled to contest the Claimants' interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 2013 Memorandum and any allegations of the breach of its terms. By way of the arbitration clause contained in Article 9 of the Memorandum, the Parties committed to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Memorandum pursuant to arbitration and have done so in good faith. The Respondent has participated fully in both the SCC Arbitration and this arbitration and has not attempted to modify or invalidate the obligation it accepted to compensate for losses caused by a change in legislation. In fact, the Respondent has stated in these proceedings that it has never denied that it would pay compensation found to be owing by the Tribunal.583\n\nTr. Day 1 (Respondents' Opening Statement), 155:2-8.\n\n540.\n\nIn summary, although the Tribunal has found in the SCC Arbitration that the Government and the Partnership Fund breached the 2013 Memorandum by failing to compensate for Telasi's losses, this does not, in itself, amount to a breach of the FET standard in the circumstances of this case. As noted previously, a breach of contract is distinct from a breach of FET, by way of the frustration of legitimate expectations or otherwise. In the circumstances before it this case, where the terms of the 2013 Memorandum are ambiguous and their interpretation is not a straightforward exercise, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's conduct did not rise to the level of a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment. Accordingly, Silk Road's claim that the Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable treatment by frustrating its legitimate expectations fails.\n\n***(b) Transparency and Predictability***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimants also allege that the Respondent treated Silk Road's investment in Telasi inconsistently, irrationally and non-transparently. The Claimants say that each of the Respondents and the NERC's own conduct in treating Silk Road lacked transparency and was unpredictable. They also say that the Respondent and the NERC were inconsistent between themselves such that the rules governing Telasi's tariffs and operations were not readily accessible and apparent and could not be traced to a consistent legal framework. Having reviewed all of the evidence, the Tribunal has concluded that any apparent inconsistency or confusion relating to the adjustment of Telasi's tariffs was the result of the complex and ambiguous nature of some of the terms of the 2013 Memorandum. The Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Respondent's or the NERC's treatment of Telasi and the adjustment of its tariffs rises to the level of a breach of FET due to a lack of transparency or consistency.\n\n542.\n\nWith respect to the adjustment of Telasi's tariffs in 2014 and 2015, the MOE engaged with the Claimants and attempted in good faith to address their concerns regarding Telasi's WAPT and the depreciation of the GEL. Although the MOE did not agree with the Claimants' interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 2013 Memorandum, it engaged in discussions with the Claimant and offered to settle the Parties' dispute on a commercial basis.584 In light of the difficulty in interpreting the complex provisions of the Memorandum, the position taken by the Respondent was not unreasonable.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178-185; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 186-190, and the sources cited there.\n\n543.\n\nWith respect to the adoption and application of the 2014 Methodology, the Tribunal has found the Respondent did not commit that Telasi's tariff regime would not change. Rather, the Parties agreed that in the event a legislative change made Telasi's position worse than at the date of the 2013 Memorandum, it would compensate for any resulting losses. The Tribunal's review of the process involving the adoption of the 2014 Methodology indicates that it was transparent. Further, the NERC provided preliminary calculations of Telasi's adjusted tariffs pursuant to the 2014 Methodology in advance of the commencement of Telasi's tariff adjustment application. The NERC conducted a thorough review and a public hearing in respect of Telasi's tariff applications in 2015, 2016 and 2017. This is reflected in the transcripts of the public hearings in which Telasi participated.585 The Tribunal notes that the NERC considered Telasi's tariff applications pursuant to its standard process, which included public hearings. In its 2015 decision, the NERC increased Telasi's Consumer Tariffs by approximately 30% despite the fact that the freeze period agreed in Clause 2.3 of the 2013 Memorandum was in effect.586 The NERC again increased Telasi's Consumer Tariffs in 2017.587\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 26, dated 3 September 2015, CL-0085; Minutes of the NERC's Hearing No. 51, dated 3 September 2015, R-0046; Respondents' Opening Presentation, slide 119 showing Telasi's Consumer Tariffs for household customers from 2014 to 2017.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 48, dated 27 December 2017, CL-0091; Respondents' Comments on Quantum Issues, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 showing the NERC also subsequently adjusted the Khrami Companies' tariffs in accordance with its interpretation of the Khrami SPA and Telasi's tariffs pursuant to the 2014 Methodology.\n\n544.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully the Claimants' allegations surrounding the 2015 review of Telasi's tariffs and, in particular, the exchange between Telasi and the MOE on 21 July 2015 regarding Telasi's rights under the 2013 Memorandum. As described above, the MOE and Inter RAO met on that date to discuss the NERC's response to Telasi's request for a WAPT-based adjustment to its Consumer Tariffs. The Claimants say that the Minister confirmed that Telasi's rights under the 2013 Memorandum would not be overridden or cancelled if it filed an application under the 2014 Methodology. This was confirmed in a brief note.588 In the Tribunal's view, this response was not misleading. As the Tribunal has determined, the Respondent did not promise that there would be no change in the tariff regime. Rather, the Parties agreed that in the event a legislative change affected Telasi's position negatively compared to its position at 31 March 2013, the Government would compensate for any losses. There was a legitimate dispute as to how the relevant provisions of the 2013 Memorandum should be interpreted and the Respondent, as a party to the Memorandum, was entitled to contest the Claimants' interpretation and claims. The Respondent engaged in good faith in the arbitration process agreed by the Parties to determine the dispute. Thus, Telasi's rights under the 2013 Memorandum were not overridden by the application of the 2014 Methodology.\n\nLetter from Kaladze (MOE) to Kobtsev (Telasi), dated 21 July 2015, C-0064.\n\n545.\n\nAccordingly, Silk Road's claim that the Respondent treated its investment in Telasi and inconsistently, irrationally and non-transparently fails.\n\nb.  **Gardabani's Claims (The Khrami Companies)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**iv. The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nGardabani says that it expected a stable legal and business environment based on the Respondent's commitments to set and adjust the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs until 2025 under the express terms of the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum. It says that it invested more than USD 100 million on the basis of Georgia's representations that the Generation Tariffs would be set and adjusted in accordance with these Agreements. It says that its expectations arose from the applicable legal framework, the 2011 Memorandum, NERC Resolution No. 5 and, in particular, the tariff regime agreed in the Khrami SPA. The Claimants say that the Respondent frustrated Gardabani's legitimate expectations by failing to ensure that the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs were adjusted as required under the terms of Clauses 1 and 2 of Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA and Clause 2.5 of the 2011 Memorandum.589 Specifically, the Claimants say that the Respondent failed to ensure that the Khrami Companies' tariffs were adjusted for the period 1 November 2016 to 1 November 2019 when the GEL devalued against the USD by more than 7% and failed to adjust Khrami-2's Tariffs when the GEL devalued against the JPY by more than 7%.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 248-253; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 166-172; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 118:22-121:11.\n\n547.\n\nThe Claimants say that Gardabani's claim is not based on an expectation of legislative and regulatory stability and they accept that an investor cannot reasonably expect the applicable legal regime to remain static. Rather, Gardabani relies on the specific commitments made by Georgia in the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum, later replicated in the 2013 Memorandum, as forming the basis for its legitimate expectation as to the tariff regime that would apply. The Claimants say that Gardabani's expectations were confirmed by NERC Resolution No. 5 which implemented the specific tariff regime agreed in the Khrami SPA. They say that the relevant provisions of NERC Resolution No. 5 were not \"provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or category of persons\" but the specific adoption of the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum setting the Khrami Companies' tariffs and the terms of their adjustment.590\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 118:24-120:5. The Claimants also say that Gardabani's expectations were reinforced during the negotiation of the Khrami SPA when the Respondent represented that the agreed tariff terms would apply to the Khrami Companies. *See* Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 119:12-119:19; Zavrazhnov I, \u00b6 19.\n\n548.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the fact that the NERC was not bound by the Khrami SPA or the 2011 and 2013 Memoranda is irrelevant. They say that any distinction between the MOE and the NERC is artificial since they are both Georgian government organs and any act of the NERC is attributable to the Respondent. The Claimants say that non-compliance with agreed tariff terms, regardless of the form or the specific agency responsible, triggered the liability of the Respondent under the BIT. Further, the Claimants say that during the negotiation of the Khrami SPA and of the 2011 and 2013 Memoranda, the Respondent represented that it would be able to implement the agreed tariff terms, which forms part of Gardabani's reasonable expectations. The Claimants say that the Respondent never suggested in any of these agreements that the implementation of the tariff provisions remained subject to the discretion of any government agency.591\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 250(b).\n\n549.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's position, the Claimants say that the Khrami Companies did not refile their initial 2016 tariff adjustment requests because the NERC had told them in clear terms that the 2014 Methodology would be applied. In light of the reduction in Telasi's tariffs in 2015 due to the application of the 2014 Methodology, Gardabani says the Khrami Companies took the sensible decision to limit their losses by abandoning their applications.592 The Claimants say that the Respondent cannot rely on the Khrami Companies' mitigation efforts to benefit from its own wrongdoing. They say that the Khrami Companies withdrew their applications to avoid an outcome similar to what had occurred to Telasi's adjustment request. Further, this decision has no bearing on Gardabani's expectation that the Respondent would honour its commitment regarding the Khrami Companies' tariffs.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 121:9-121:11; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 170.\n\n550.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's argument that it respected Gardabani's legitimate expectations when in 2017 the NERC applied the provisions of the Khrami SPA to determine the Khrami Companies' new tariff adjustment requests, the Claimants say that the NERC's tariff adjustment decision did not comply with the terms of the Khrami SPA. The NERC did not use the exchange rate comparators set out in Clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA, but chose, instead, to minimize the adjustments by using the average rather than the snapshot rates. Further, the NERC applied the USD rate adjustment to only part of the Generation Tariffs: the Supplement only, excluding the basic tariff, in breach of Clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA.593\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.\n\n551.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's position that even if it misapplied the Khrami Companies' tariff adjustment provisions in 2017 this would not be unfair or inequitable, the Claimants say the NERC's decisions set out in Resolutions Nos. 30 and 31 were not simply \"imperfect\". Rather they represented a complete disregard, without meaningful explanation, of the agreed tariff adjustment provisions. They say that this was a material, substantive defect, not just a minor imperfection or procedural issue, in breach of the agreed tariff adjustment arrangement at the core of Gardabani's legitimate expectations when it made its investment to purchase the Khrami Companies.594\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 168-169; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 120:21-121:8. On this basis, the Claimants distinguish the award in *AES v. Hungary,* relied on by the Respondent.\n\n552.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's argument that Gardabani waived or lost its claim under the BIT because the Khrami Companies did not pursue judicial review in the Georgian courts, the Claimants say that the BIT imposes no requirement that local remedies be exhausted before initiating arbitration. The Claimants take the same position with respect to the Respondent's argument that Gardabani did not object to NERC Resolutions Nos. 30 and 31 at the public hearing on 31 October 2017. The BIT does not require an investor to exhaust local remedies or complain at a public hearing before commencing arbitration and no such obligation exists as a matter of international law. In any event, the Claimants say that the Khrami Companies made their position clear at the public hearing when Mr. Kandelaki stated that the adjustments requested by the Khrami Companies were justified and that he would refrain from further comment in light of the ongoing dispute between the Parties.595\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 172; C-0214, Transcript of the public hearing held by the NERC regarding the Khrami Companies tariff application, dated 31 October 2017, p. 6.\n\n***(b) Transparency and Predictability***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nGardabani also claims that the Respondent treated its investments inconsistently, irrationally and non-transparently when in May and August 2016, the NERC stated that it could not adjust the Khrami Companies' tariffs under the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum, as requested, because the 2014 Methodology applied and it had no legal basis to apply the Khrami SPA. Nevertheless, the following year the NERC purported to apply the tariff adjustment provisions of the Khrami SPA.596\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 185(e) and (f); Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 125:5-126:8.\n\n**v. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it breached the requirement to provide fair and equitable treatment, whether by frustrating Gardabani's legitimate expectations or any obligation of transparency.597\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 349-362; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 359-371, 380.\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n555.\n\nWith respect to Gardabani's legitimate expectations, the Respondent says that the NERC adjusted the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs on 31 October 2017 in application of the NERC's Resolution No. 5 which replicated the tariff adjustment mechanisms in Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA. It maintains that the only dispute between the Parties relates to the Khrami Companies' complaints regarding the NERC's decision to reject their request for compensation based on the non-adjustment of the Generation Tariffs as of November 2016 and the NERC's understanding of the scope of application of the adjustment mechanisms in its Resolution No. 5.598\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 359.\n\n556.\n\nWith respect to the Khrami Companies' 2016 tariff adjustment applications, the Respondent says that Gardabani could not reasonably have expected that the Khrami Companies' tariffs would be adjusted on 1 November 2016 or that compensation for non-adjustment would be due, in light of the Khrami Companies' abandonment of their applications.599 According to the Respondent, any legitimate expectations of the Khrami Companies in 2016 must be based on the terms of the Khrami SPA and the applicable legal framework. The Khrami SPA does not establish any procedure for the implementation of its tariff adjustment provisions. However, Clause 9.3 of the Khrami SPA provides that \"\u2026 the issues which are not stipulated in this Agreement shall be regulated by the effective Georgian legislation\". Therefore, the implementation of the tariff adjustment provisions of the Khrami SPA is governed by Georgian Law which requires the submission of tariff applications to the NERC in the prescribed format and gives the NERC full discretion to dismiss non-compliant tariff applications without considering their merits.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 360; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 351.\n\n557.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that Clause 1.15 of the Khrami SPA provides that the Government will not be liable for the non-application of the tariff provisions in Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA if the Khrami Companies fail to submit compliant tariff applications.600 In these circumstances, Gardabani could not reasonably have expected that the NERC would adjust the Khrami Companies' tariffs or that the Government would be liable for the NERC's failure to do so when they did not submit tariff applications compliant with the 2014 Methodology.601\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 363. However, Clause 1.15 of the Khrami SPA relates to situations where the NERC Resolution implementing the tariffs set out in the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA is not delivered by the Final Payment Date due to the failure by the Khrami Companies to submit applications to the NERC by 1 July 2011. The NERC issued its Resolution No. 5, which established the tariffs and the terms of their adjustment on 7 April 2011. Clause 1.15 of the Khrami SPA does not purport to apply with respect to subsequent tariff applications.\n\nFor the reasons set out in the SCC Partial Award, the Respondent also argued that Gardabani and the Khrami Companies had lost any rights to make a complaint in respect of the 2016 Application as they had not fulfilled a pre-condition to an adjustment or had waived any right to an adjustment. The Tribunal's findings rejecting the Respondent's argument are set out at \u00b6\u00b6 707-723 of the SCC Partial Award on Liability. In addition, the Respondent says that the Claimants knew that in order to protect their interests under the Khrami SPA, the Khrami Companies had no choice but to apply to the NERC and request a modification of their tariffs. *See* Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 364 and the sources cited there.\n\n558.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that Gardabani's alleged legitimate expectations with respect to the adjustment mechanisms in Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA and in the NERC's Resolution No. 5 are meritless since Gardabani has failed to demonstrate that it actually held any expectations with respect to the scope of application of the relevant adjustment mechanisms. Further, the Claimants have not demonstrated that Gardabani relied upon the alleged expectations in deciding to acquire the Khrami Companies, that those expectations were \"reasonable\" and \"legitimate\" or that Georgia's conduct frustrated any such expectations.602\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 365.\n\n559.\n\nThe Respondent says that there is no evidence supporting Gardabani's claimed expectation with respect to the exchange rate adjustment in Clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of Annex 1 of the Khrami SPA, nor that the alleged expectation relating to the GEL/USD adjustment rate in Clause 2.2 applied to the entire tariff, rather than just the Supplement to the tariff in the period from 2014 to 2021. As a result, the Claimants have no basis to claim that the NERC's implementation of the tariff adjustment provisions in Annex 1 to the Khrami SPA frustrated Gardabani's expectations.\n\n560.\n\nFurther, and in any event, the Respondent says that even assuming, contrary to fact, that the NERC misapplied the adjustment mechanisms contained in the 2011 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum, this would not establish a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The Respondent says there was nothing unfair or arbitrary about the NERC's adjustment of the Khrami Companies' tariffs in October 2017. In this regard, the Respondent referred to the award in *AES v. Hungary,* which states as follows:\n\n*[I]t is not every process failing or imperfection that will amount to a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment. The standard is not one of perfection. It is only when a state's acts or procedural omissions are, on the facts and in the context before the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety) \u2013 to use the words of the Tecmed Tribunal \u2013 that the standard can be said to have been infringed.603*\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 353 quoting from *AES v. Hungary*, CL-0008, \u00b6 9.3.40.\n\n561.\n\nFurther, the *AES* tribunal noted that the claimant had had an opportunity to submit input during the implementation of the relevant price decrees and had also had an opportunity to seek to review the process before the Hungarian courts. The Respondent says that, in this case, the Khrami Companies had the opportunity to provide input on the NERC's tariff resolution during the public hearing on 31 October 2017. Although their General Director attended the hearing, he failed to provide any input on the NERC's proposed implementation of the tariff adjustment mechanisms. Further, the Khrami Companies had the opportunity to seek judicial review of the NERC's tariff resolutions, but chose not to do so.604 While it accepts that the BIT does not require investors to exhaust local remedies, the Respondent says that investment tribunals have confirmed that an investor's failure to challenge local authorities' decisions is a relevant factor in assessing whether the State failed to accord FET.605\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 355.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 367-369; *M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award, dated 31 July 2007, RL-0074, \u00b6 302; CL-0135, *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, dated 14 June 2010, CL-0135, \u00b6 28.\n\n562.\n\nThe Respondent also says the NERC's interpretation and application of the relevant adjustment mechanisms was not part of a pattern of state conduct. In this regard, the Claimants commenced this arbitration while the tariff review process concerning the Khrami Companies was still under way. The Respondent suggests that Gardabani and Inter Rao directed the Khrami Companies to not engage with the process.606\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 371.\n\n***(b) Transparency and Predictability***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nWith respect to Gardabani's allegations relating to the obligation of transparency and consistency, the Respondent says that the various measures about which Gardabani complains were implemented in good faith on the basis of considerations set forth in the applicable law and regulations, in accordance with applicable procedure, provided due process to the Claimants and were always amply motivated. Further, the evidence indicates that the policy considerations underlying the NERC's measures were made clear and there is no basis to conclude they were implemented for pretextual reasons.607\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 372-385.\n\n564.\n\nWith respect to the non-adjustment of the Khrami Companies' tariffs in 2016, the Respondent says that the Claimants knew that Gardabani could not give effect to the tariff adjustment provisions in the Khrami SPA and claim compensation for any non-application of those provisions without causing the Khrami Companies to submit compliant tariff applications to the NERC. If the Claimants truly believed that the NERC would adjust the Khrami Companies' tariffs in accordance with the 2014 Methodology, the Respondent says that they had the opportunity to present their views on the appropriate legal basis for the claimed adjustments. However, the Khrami Companies did not do so, despite repeated invitations and extensions of time from the NERC.608\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 380; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 362.\n\n**vi. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe circumstances relevant to Gardabani's claim relating to its legitimate expectations are somewhat different from those of Silk Road. Gardabani invested in the Khrami Companies by way of the Khrami SPA by which it purchased 100% of the shares of the Khrami Companies on 12 April 2011. This was provided for in the 2011 Memorandum which stated that in order to ensure Gardabani's return on its investment in the acquisition of the Khrami Companies, their tariffs would be set at specific levels and adjusted to ensure guaranteed debt servicing of Khrami-2's debt with the Japan International Cooperation Agency and to offset fluctuation in the JPY-USD exchange rate and inflation with respect to both Companies. The NERC approved and implemented the provisions of the 2011 Memorandum relating to the Khrami Companies' tariffs agreed between the Government and Inter RAO. This occurred on 7 April 2011.609 Subsequently, on 12 April 2011, Gardabani and the Respondents signed the Khrami SPA. Then, on 8 June 2011, the NERC approved and adopted the 2011 Methodology which provided that the terms of the Methodology would not apply to enterprises for which long-term tariffs were set based on transactions concluded by the State.610\n\nNERC Resolution No. 5, CL-0080.\n\n2011 Methodology, CL-0081, Section 27.\n\n566.\n\nIn addition, at the Claimants' insistence, the Parties to the Khrami SPA negotiated and agreed Clause 5.2.2 which reads as follows:\n\n*5.2.2*\n\n*The Sellers and the Government shall, jointly and severally and/or separately, bear full responsibility for any damage, loss and/or expenses incurred by the Buyer and/or the Companies which may arise as a result of and/or in relation to the nullification, non-application in any form or alteration of the tariffs and conditions of their adjustment as determined in accordance with Section 1.1.5 and Annex #1 of this Agreement, during any time of application of such tariffs and conditions of their adjustment. In case if the circumstances described in this section takes place, Sections 1.16.1 and 1.16.2 of this Agreement shall apply.*\n\n567.\n\nClause 1.15 of the Khrami SPA required the Government to deliver a resolution of the NERC establishing the tariffs of the Khrami Companies and the terms of their correction as set out in the 2011 Memorandum and in Annex #1 of the SPA. In the event the Government did not deliver the required NERC resolution, the Buyer (Gardabani), had the option at its sole discretion to rescind the Agreement. Clause 1.18 of the SPA confirmed that any inconsistency of the tariffs in terms of their adjustment in the NERC's resolution with the provisions of Annex #1 of the Khrami SPA was to be considered a breach of the requirement to provide the NERC resolution required by Clause 1.15.\n\n568.\n\nAs summarized above, Gardabani says that at the time it purchased the shares of the Khrami Companies, it had a legitimate, objectively reasonable expectation arising from the applicable legal framework at the time and the representations made by Georgia's representatives that the Khrami Companies' tariffs and their adjustment would be governed by the terms of the Khrami SPA until the end of 2025.\n\n569.\n\nThe Respondent says that Gardabani has not demonstrated a legitimate expectation or that it relied upon any such expectations. In addition, and in any event, it says that it applied the terms of the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum to the Khrami Companies' tariff adjustment application in 2017. It also says that even if the NERC's application of the tariff provisions of the SPA may not have been entirely correct, the Khrami Companies and Gardabani could not expect perfection in this regard. Further, Gardabani and the Khrami Companies did not fully participate in the tariff review applications and did not challenge the NERC's decision in the Georgian courts at the time.\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the evidence of Mr. Zavrazhnov, the head of Inter RAO's Transcaucasia, Turkey and Middle East division who participated in the negotiation of the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. He testified that the long-term agreement regarding the Khrami Companies' tariffs in the 2011 Memorandum was a pre-condition to Gardabani's purchase of the Khrami Companies. For that reason, it was critical that the Khrami SPA include the same long-term tariff and adjustment mechanism provided for in the 2011 Memorandum.611 Further, he says that while the Claimants did not consider the NERC to be a negotiating party to the Khrami SPA, they requested that MOE procure the adoption of the agreed tariff regime by the NERC. This was achieved by NERC Resolution No. 5, adopted five days prior to the signature of the Khrami SPA. From this, the Claimants say they understood that the MOE and the NERC were acting in cooperation in order to implement the terms of the 2011 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. In addition, according to Mr. Zavrazhnov, since Inter RAO was concerned that the Government might not abide by the terms of the Khrami SPA, it insisted that the Agreement include a provision establishing responsibility on the part of the Government and the Sellers for any damage or loss incurred by Gardabani or the Khrami Companies arising from a violation of the agreed tariff regime.612\n\nZavrazhnov I, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.\n\nZavrazhnov I, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. Although he contests other aspects of Mr. Zavrazhnov's evidence, Mr. Khetaguri does not challenge this evidence of Mr. Zavrazhnov. *See* Khetaguri I, \u00b6\u00b6 31-46; Khetaguri II, \u00b6\u00b6 22-30.\n\n571.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimants have not established that at the time they concluded the Khrami SPA, Gardabani had a legitimate expectation that the tariffs and their adjustment provisions contained in Annex #1 to the Khrami SPA and NERC Resolution No. 5 would remain unchanged and unaffected by the decisions of the NERC throughout the entire course of the Khrami SPA to 31 December 2025. Rather, as testified by Mr. Zavrazhnov, the Claimants were concerned that the terms of the Khrami SPA might not be respected and, therefore insisted on the inclusion in the Khrami SPA of Clause 5.2.2. This Clause provides for the Sellers' and the Government's joint and several responsibilities in the event of non-application of the tariffs and the conditions of their adjustment. However, it is not a stabilization clause and does not provide a commitment by the Respondent that there would be no alteration of the tariffs or the conditions of their adjustment until the end of 2025. Rather, bearing in mind the term of the Khrami SPA, from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2025, it suggests that the opposite could occur. Any legitimate expectation Gardabani may have had at the time of the conclusion of the Khrami SPA was that it would be compensated for any damage or loss from the non-applications or the conditions of their adjustment provided for in the Agreement and NERC Resolution No. 5.\n\n572.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties concerns the failure to adjust the Khrami Companies' tariffs in 2016 and the application of the adjustment provisions in 2017. There is no dispute relating to the levels of the tariffs themselves, which remained as set out in the Khrami SPA and NERC Resolution No. 5.\n\n573.\n\nFor the reasons set out in the SCC Partial Award on Liability (at paragraphs 707-794), Tribunal has found that the Government and the Sellers breached the specific obligations of Clause 5.2.2 as a result of the NERC's non-application of the tariff adjustment provisions of Annex #1 to the Khrami SPA in 2016 and its incorrect application of those provisions in 2017. However, in the Tribunal's view, these contractual breaches do not amount to a breach of Gardabani's legitimate expectations under the BIT.\n\n574.\n\nSimilar to the situation under the 2013 Memorandum and Clause 5.2 of that Agreement, the most Gardabani and the Claimants could legitimately expect is that the Government would bear responsibility for any damage or loss incurred as the result of the non-application or alteration of the tariffs and conditions of their adjustment. Gardabani has pursued the Government and the Sellers for breach of contract in the SCC Arbitration and has been partially successful. However, a breach of contract is distinct from a breach of legitimate expectations, particularly in this case. In response to Gardabani's claim under the Khrami SPA, the Government participated in the SCC Arbitration, and this Arbitration, in good faith. It has not denied its responsibility to compensate for damage or loss incurred by Gardabani. As in the case of the Claimants' claims under the 2013 Memorandum, as a party to the Khrami SPA the Respondent was entitled to contest the claims against it. In the Tribunal's view, the positions adopted by the Respondent were not unreasonable.\n\n575.\n\nThe relevant tariff adjustment clauses of Annex #1 to the Khrami SPA are ambiguous and were difficult to interpret. As a consequence, it is not apparent that Gardabani had any specific intention as to how those clauses would be applied by the NERC. The only expectation Gardabani could legitimately have had at the time of concluding the Khrami SPA was that the Government would bear responsibility and compensate for any losses flowing from the non-application or alteration the tariffs and their conditions of adjustment. Although, ultimately, the Government's and the NERC's interpretation of the clauses and their position with respect to the adjustment of Gardabani's tariffs in 2016 and 2017 have proved to be incorrect, and, therefore, in breach of contract, these were not unreasonable or arbitrary such as to give rise to a breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n576.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the NERC's failure to accept the Khrami Companies' tariff adjustment applications in 2016 and its interpretation of the tariff adjustment provisions in Annex #1 to the Khrami SPA and NERC Resolution No. 5 did not amount to a breach of Gardabani's legitimate expectations. As the Tribunal has now determined in the SCC Arbitration the compensation due to Gardabani, the Respondent must now make payment consistent with Gardabani's legitimate expectation that it would be compensated for losses flowing from the non-application or alteration of the tariffs and their conditions of adjustment. In the SCC Final Award dated 9 September 2022 the Tribunal found the compensation due to Gardabani is USD 27,499,000. The Respondent must now pay this amount in compensation to Gardabani.\n\n***(b) Transparency and Predictability***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the NERC's treatment of Gardabani's 2016 and 2017 tariff-adjustment applications amounts to the breach of any obligation of transparency or predictability owed by the Respondent.\n\n578.\n\nWith respect to the NERC's dismissal of Gardabani's 2016 Application to adjust the Khrami Companies' tariffs, the NERC explained the need for the Khrami Companies to submit applications compliant with the 2014 Methodology and afforded them the opportunity to submit compliant applications and explained the consequences of failure to do so. While the NERC's position regarding the requirement to submit an application pursuant to the 2014 Methodology ultimately proved to be incorrect, the NERC was transparent in its dealings with the Khrami Companies.\n\n579.\n\nWith respect to the Khrami Companies' 2017 Applications, these were submitted in a form compliant with the requirements of the 2014 Methodology. The NERC then addressed the applications pursuant to its established procedure which included the opportunity for the Khrami Companies to participate by providing comments and attending a public hearing. The NERC reconsidered its previous position that there was no legal basis for it to apply the terms of the Khrami SPA rather than the 2014 Methodology. Although its application of the tariff adjustment provisions of Annex #1 to the SPA and NERC Resolution No. 5 was not in accordance with the Tribunal's ultimate interpretation of those provisions, the NERC's interpretation was not arbitrary or unreasonable in light of the ambiguity of the provisions in question and the difficulty in their interpretation. In the Tribunal's view, the NERC's interpretation and application of the adjustment provisions in question is a matter of contractual interpretation. As the Tribunal has noted previously, a breach of contract does not necessarily amount to a breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n580.\n\nAs result, Gardabani's claim that the Respondent failed to accord it transparent and predictable treatment fails.\n\nc. **The Claimants' Supplemental Claims**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nIn addition to their claims in respect of the alleged tariff-related breaches, the Claimants advance three separate supplemental claims where they say Georgia was in breach of the obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment of their investments.613\n\nTr.

The Claimants say that this arrangement guaranteed sales for the Khrami Companies, made possible the return of funds used to acquire the Khrami hydro facilities in 2011, and locked in synergies between the generation and distribution businesses.623 The Claimants submit that Georgia's decision to not allocate Khrami energy to Telasi during the 2018 peak season left the Khrami Companies to scramble for alternative buyers, leading to selling their energy at lower prices than what Telasi would have paid. Meanwhile, Telasi was left to purchase more expensive energy from the COPS in order to meet its requirements.624\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 129:11-130:5.\n\nTr.

Telasi's Purchase Portfolio Volatility**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nThe Claimants say that Georgia was erratic, inconsistent and not transparent in its regulation of Telasi's purchase portfolio in 2017 and that the motivation for this was the distribution of dividends to Telasi's shareholders in April 2017. The Claimants say that the Government was opposed to that distribution and that the following month, the MOE announced that the amount of inexpensive electricity that Telasi would receive from Enguri would be reduced, contrary to the NERC's Annual Energy Plan for 2017.625 The Claimants say that this resulted in Telasi's energy allocation deviating significantly from the planned purchase portfolio and required Telasi to purchase energy from the COPS at much higher prices. According to the Claimants, this resulted in an all-time low cash balance, an all-time high accounts payable and interest and penalties being incurred due to delays in settling its liabilities with its suppliers.626\n\nTr.

Until April 2017, Telasi and the other major Georgian distribution company, Energo-Pro, received energy from Enguri, the cheapest source of electricity available to distributors, under long-term supply agreements in proportion to their market share in the Georgian distribution market.627 The Claimants say this changed after Telasi paid out dividends in 2017. By way of a letter dated 25 May 2017, the MOE significantly reduced Telasi's allocation of Enguri energy for the period from May to July.628 In its letter, the MOE advised that the analysis of the current and projected data for the year showed a \"significant disbalance\" between the electric power procurement costs and the income figures for the companies holding electric power distribution licenses. According to the MOE and the COPS, this created cash deficits for certain distribution companies which faced problems in paying their taxes. This, in turn, was said to pose a threat to the financial stability of the entire electricity system. As a result, the MOE changed the current distribution procedure to address the problem by reallocating cheaper energy from Enguri and Vardnili.629 This resulted in a reduction of the electricity Telasi expected to receive from Enguri under the NERC's Annual Energy Plan.630\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 162; Abdala & Delamer I, \u00b6 21. Telasi's market share was approximately 35% and Energo-Pro's market share was approximately 65% (Energo-Pro purchased Kakheti in 2017).

The Claimants say that according to the NERC's Energy Plan for 2017, Telasi was to receive 120 million kWh of energy from Enguri in May, 136 million kWh in June, and 153 million kWh in August. However, Telasi in fact only received 95 million kWh in May, 57 million kWh in June and 97 million kWh in July. *See* Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 164 and fn 350.\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimants say that from May to July 2017, each time Telasi applied to receive the volumes of energy from Enguri provided for in the NERC's Annual Energy Plan, the COPS stated that a technical issue prevented the transfer of the electricity from Enguri to Tbilisi.631 The Claimants say that the COPS' explanation was false and that the Respondent has not produced any documents confirming any technical issues that would have impeded the delivery of Enguri electricity to Telasi at the time.632\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 92(b), 189; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6163; Kobtsev I, \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6189. *See also*, Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 163 where the Claimants say that the COPS' explanation was a pretext as technical reasons had never previously hindered Telasi's purchase of energy from Enguri.\n\n589.\n\nThe Claimants contest the other explanations given by the Respondent in these proceedings for the reduced allocation of Enguri energy to Telasi for the period of May to July 2017. With respect to the Respondent's position that the shortage of Enguri and Vardnili energy was the result of the unexpected increase in electricity consumption in the occupied territories of Abkhazia during the Winter of 2017, the Claimants say that the volume of Enguri and Vardnili electricity exports was only unusually high in one of the three months in question (July) and exports for May and June 2017 were very similar to those for the same months in 2016 and 2018. Therefore, the need to meet the increased demand for energy in Abkhazia in early 2017 does not explain the subsequent diversion of energy of Enguri and Vardnili from Telasi.633\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 92(c); Abdala & Delamer II, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 220. The Claimants also say that the documents produced by the Respondent relating to monthly average export and import tariffs for Enguri and Vardnili do not show that these companies had to pay for expensive imports of electricity from Russia between February and March 2017 with emergency exports of Enguri and Vardnili electricity in July 2017, as maintained by the Respondent. *See* Claimants' Reply, \u00b6188.\n\n590.\n\nThe Claimants also contest the Respondent's position that the under-supply of Enguri and Vardnili energy to Telasi started in January 2017 and that therefore the diversion of energy could not have been related to Telasi's dividend payments in April 2017. The Claimants say there was no unusual deviation from Telasi's planned purchase portfolio during the period from January to April 2017 and that it was only in May 2017 that Telasi's energy allocation began to deviate significantly from its purchase portfolio.634\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 92(d); Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 218-219.\n\n591.\n\nThe Claimants say that although the MOE allocated additional electricity from Enguri to Telasi in August 2017 and the situation was normalized by the end of 2017, the additional allocation of electricity did not offset the detriment to Telasi. The Claimants say that the volatility in Telasi's purchase portfolio between May and December 2017 inflicted lasting financial damage on Telasi.635 The Claimants summarized these effects as follows:\n\n(a) Telasi's cash-flows were negatively affected when it was forced to replace cheaper electricity from Enguri and Vardnili with more expensive electricity. Telasi's electricity costs from May-July 2017 exceeded its planned levels by GEL 1.28 million, reaching all-time high deviations after May 2017.\n\n(b) Monthly deviations from Telasi's planned electricity volumes were almost five times greater than the historical average. This resulted in cash-flow volatility, increasing the spread between the highest and lowest monthly cash-flow for the period by 30% as compared to the plan. This increased volatility and unpredictability affected certain components of Telasi's working capital. For example, Telasi's liabilities with suppliers peaked in May and June 2017 and its cash level reached all-time lows during the same period.\n\n(c) The increased volatility and unpredictability of Telasi's monthly cash-flows would result in increased risks, inevitably taken into account on assessing the value of Telasi either through the discount rate, cash-flows or opportunity costs. The Ministry of Energy's additional electricity allocation did not off-set the detriment to Telasi in this regard. As a regulated company with a single line of business, Telasi was unable to mitigate regulatory risk through diversification.636\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 167; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 94. The Claimants rely on the first two expert reports of Messrs. Abdala & Delamer, Abdala & Delamer I and Abdala & Delamer II. In their third expert report, Messrs. Abdala & Delamer reviewed and commented on additional data provided by the Respondents submitted after the filing of their second report. On the basis of the new data, which covered Telasi, Energo Pro and Kakheti, they confirmed their conclusion in their previous reports that starting in May 2017, the allocation of electricity from Enguri to Telasi and the other distributors evolved from \"discretionary\" to \"arbitrary\". They also concluded that in the period during May to July 2017, the electricity purchases from Enguri allocated to Telasi relative to the other distributors were disproportionately low, compared to planned levels. In their view, this confirmed their conclusions of increased unpredictability and corresponding regulatory risks in relation to Telasi's supplies of electricity. *See* Abdala & Delamer III, \u00b6\u00b6 3-9.\n\n592.\n\nThe Claimants quantify the losses they say Telasi suffered as a result of the treatment of Telasi's purchase portfolio in the amount of USD $13,000. The Claimants' expert, Mr. Peer, calculated this amount on the basis of the additional expenses and resulting cash shortfall due to the redirection of Enguri and Vardnili energy away from Telasi. Mr. Peer estimated Telasi's loss on the basis of the investment return Telasi could have received had they not been required to meet the cash shortfall.637\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 256; Peer II, \u00b6\u00b6 3.5.1, 13.1-13.3.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Position***\n-------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nThe Respondent says that it acted in a predictable, transparent and reasonable manner with respect to all of Silk Road's investments.638 The Respondent denies that the deviations which Silk Road complains of were in retaliation for Telasi's decision to distribute dividends. The Respondent says that the deviations in Telasi's purchase portfolio started in February 2017, before Telasi decided to issue dividends in April 2017.639\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 193, 381; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 219; C-0118, Letter from Kobtsev to Milorava, dated 7 June 2017, p. 1; C-0104, Purchase Portfolio of Telasi in 2017; C-0105, Power Purchase Plan of the NERC for 2017.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 193, 381; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 219; C-0118, Letter from Kobtsev to Milorava, dated 7 June 2017, p. 1; C-0104, Purchase Portfolio of Telasi in 2017; C-0105, Power Purchase Plan of the NERC for 2017.\n\n594.\n\nThe Respondent says that the deviations were due to the need to supply additional electricity to occupied territories of Abkhazia during the winter of 2017. The Respondent says that as the designated suppliers of energy to Abkhazia, Enguri and Vardnili were required to apply all of their output to Abkhazia and to purchase additional volumes of expensive electricity to cover any shortfall. Subsequently, after the peak in demand had subsided, Enguri and Vardnili needed to export their electricity in order to cover the costs incurred to purchase additional electricity to meet Abkhazia's requirements. As a result, according to the Respondent, Enguri and Vardnili also delivered less energy to Energo-Pro, the other major Georgian distributor. This caused an increase in the purchase cost of electricity on the Georgian market.640 The Respondent says that the MOE attempted to allocate additional volumes of Enguri and Vardnili energy to Telasi and Energo-Pro in May 2017. However, this was not sufficient to compensate Telasi for the shortfall of energy during the first half of the year. After exchanges with Telasi, the MOE took measures to ensure that Telasi would receive additional supplies from Enguri and Vardnili.641 The Respondent says that as a result, Telasi received more Enguri electricity than forecasted during the second half of 2017 such that its average WAPT in 2017 was lower than the forecasted WAPT reflected in its tariffs.642\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 220; Milorava III, \u00b6 75; Law on Electricity, CL-0073 / RL-0001, p. 30, requiring Enguri and Vardnili to supply electricity to the occupied territories of Abkhazia; Electricity (Capacity) Market Rules, CL-0070, Article 38(2), requiring Enguri and Vardnili to procure electricity from other sources at their own cost when electricity consumption in Abkhazia exceeded their output; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195 and the sources cited there.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 221, 359; Letter from Valishvili to Telasi *et al*, 25 May 2017, C-0117, p. 1; Valishvili IV, \u00b6 64; Letter from Valishvili to Telasi, Enguri, EnergoPro, COPS and GSE, dated 25 August 2017, C-0131, p. 1.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 222; Milorava III, \u00b6 75; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 195.\n\n595.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the monthly deviations in Telasi's planned volumes were five times their historical average and affected Telasi's cash flow or WAPT. The Respondent says the Claimants' arguments are based on a partial analysis of the planned and actual electricity volumes received by Telasi from Enguri during two years and three months only. They say that Telasi should have considered a longer period because variable rainfall year-to-year affects the supply of electricity.643\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 196; Moselle II, \u00b6 10.5, responding to Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 94(b).\n\n596.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Dr. Moselle, says the Claimants' experts, Messrs. Abdala and Delamer, do not show the difference between the actual figures and expected electricity expenses, but only the difference between actual and what Telasi would have expected with perfect foresight regarding every cost and uncertainty regarding the volume of Enguri energy.644 According to Dr. Moselle, the Claimants and their experts should have considered a longer period of time (rather than two years and three months) in order to draw a meaningful conclusion of the historical size of deviations in the amount of electricity supplied to Telasi from Enguri. In his view, this was particularly so in view of the fact that Enguri is an HPP whose ability to supply electricity depends on rainfall and can vary significantly from year to year.645\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 197; Moselle II, \u00b6 10.14.\n\nMoselle II, \u00b6 10.5-10.6.\n\n597.\n\nThe Respondent also contests the Claimants' claim that there were unusually large deviations between Telasi's actual and expected electricity expenses. According to Dr. Moselle, Dr. Abdala and Mr. Delamer's analysis does not show the difference between actual and expected electricity expenses. Rather, it shows the difference between actual electricity expenses and \"what Telasi would have expected electricity expenses to be if it had perfect foresight concerning every cost uncertainty other than the uncertainty concerning the volume of electricity that would come from Enguri\".646 According to Dr. Moselle, it is impossible to tell from Dr. Abdala's and Mr. Delamer's analysis whether Telasi's electricity expenses in May-June 2017 were in fact higher than expected or whether any deviation between the plan and expected costs due to the change of allocation of Enguri electricity was material in comparison to the other uncertainties that affected Telasi's cost of electricity.647\n\nMoselle II, \u00b6 10.14.\n\nMoselle II, \u00b6 10.15.\n\n598.\n\nDr. Moselle also challenged Dr. Abdala and Mr. Delamer's analysis of Telasi's accounts payable which was said to have increased in order to fund the shortfall in Enguri and Vardnili energy. According to Dr. Moselle, the analysis focusses only on a fraction of Telasi's accounts payable rather than looking at all relevant components which, according to him, would show that there was no dramatic increase in Telasi's accounts payable in the summer of 2017.648\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 197; Moselle II, \u00b6\u00b6 10.25-10.29. Dr. Moselle also denies that Dr. Abdala and Mr. Delamer analysis demonstrates that the deviation in Telasi's purchase portfolio caused it additional exposure to liquidity risk or any direct negative impact on its financial statements. Further, even if there were theoretical increases in risk, Dr. Moselle says this could only be relevant if it were material. According to him, Dr. Abdala and Mr. Delamer did not provide any analysis to support that conclusion. *See* Moselle II, \u00b6\u00b6 10.30-10.34.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent acted erratically and in a non-transparent manner with regard to the regulation of Silk Road's investments such that Telasi and Silk Road were unable to discern the regulatory environment in which they were to operate, and to adopt and implement a commercial strategy. They suggest that due to Telasi's payment of dividends in April 2017, the MOE reduced the supply of Enguri energy to Telasi which affected its cash flow and financial situation. Telasi's Mr. Kobtsev testified that reducing Telasi's access to cheap Enguri energy may have been Georgia's response to paying out dividends.649 The Claimants allege that the Respondents' explanations for the reduction in the allocation of Enguri energy to Telasi were false and inconsistent. They also maintain that although additional quantities of Enguri energy were supplied to Telasi such that by the end of 2017 the situation had been normalized, Telasi nonetheless suffered losses due to cash shortages which required expensive borrowing to supplement its working capital and increased exposure to regulatory risk.\n\nKobtsev I, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63. Kobtsev explains that when Telasi paid out dividends in 2015, Ms. Valishvili was angry by the dividend distribution which she alleged was in violation of the 2013 Memorandum. Mr. Kobtsev says that, in response, he told Ms. Valishvili that the payment had been approved by the Partnership Fund. In 2017, the Partnership Fund voted against the payment of dividends, but the decision was adopted by the necessary majority of Telasi's shareholders.\n\n600.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it diverted Enguri energy away from Telasi in retaliation for Telasi's decision to pay dividends to its shareholders in April 2017. Rather, they say the deviation in energy supply was the result of the unexpected increases in electricity consumption in the occupied territories of Abkhazia which were required to be covered by Enguri and Vardnili. It says that the MOE attempted to minimize the impact of the temporary unavailability of Enguri energy on Telasi's cash flow and that by the end of 2017, Telasi received more Enguri energy than had been forecasted and that its average WAPT in 2017 was lower than the WAPT forecasted in its tariffs.\n\n601.\n\nFrom its review of the evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the reduction in Telasi's allocation of Enguri and Vardnili energy in the months of May to July 2017 was a retaliatory measure for the payment of dividends by Telasi in April of that year. It is more likely that the deviation in supply of Enguri energy was due to the unexpected increase in electricity consumption in Abkhazia during the winter of 2017. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Telasi had started receiving less Enguri and Vardnili energy than forecasted before Telasi's decision to pay dividends.650 Further, the Tribunal finds Ms. Milorava's evidence explaining the need to supply additional energy to Abkhazia and the steps taken in response persuasive and supported by the documentary evidence.651 In the Tribunal's view, the temporary reduction in Enguri and Vardnili energy supply to Telasi of which the Claimants complain was due to unforeseen operational requirements and does not amount to erratic or non-transparent conduct in breach of the Respondent's obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 193; Power Purchase Plan for the NERC for 2017, C-0105; Purchase Portfolio of Telasi in 2017, C-0104.\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6 75; Milorava II, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 195 and the documents cited there.\n\n602.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is not required to address the difference between the Parties' experts on the impact of the deviation in Telasi's purchase portfolio, including Telasi's actual and expected electricity expenses and accounts payable. In any event, the Tribunal notes the relativity modest loss claimed by Silk Road (USD 13,000) in respect of this claim. In the Tribunals view, the amount claimed could easily fall within the margin of difference between the experts' assessment of any loss caused by the deviation in Telasi's purchase portfolio.\n\n**viii. The Cost of New Connections**\n-------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nThe 2013 Memorandum does not mention the cost of new connections. The Claimants' claim is that, separate from the 2013 Memorandum, the Government assured Inter RAO and Telasi that they would fully recover Telasi's costs of connecting new customers to the distribution network652. They say this has not occurred despite the Respondent's repeated promises. The Claimants do not specify an amount of damages for the cost of new connections, but maintain in their written submissions that Telasi suffered \"loss of several million GEL each year since at least 2013 \u2026 and continues to do so\".653\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 150-154; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 85-90; Tr.

The connection fee had not been adjusted by the NERC since 2011. If Telasi does not comply with the NERC's connection deadlines, it must pay a penalty. For each new connection, Telasi must obtain a construction permit from the Tbilisi town council and approvals from ecological authorities and other city authorities. Due to delays in the issuance of regular construction permits, the Claimants say that Telasi often had to request fast-track construction permits, which cost it GEL 400 each.\n\nNERC Resolution No. 21, dated 18 September 2008, CL-0076; NERC Resolution No. 20, dated 18 September 2008, (consolidating amendments as of 26 September 2012), Art. 26, CL-0077; NERC Resolution No. 6, dated 19 April 2017, CL-0087.\n\n605.\n\nIn September 2014, Inter RAO and Telasi started complaining to the MOE that the new user connection fees were insufficient to cover Telasi's actual costs and requested full compensation of these costs.655 The Parties' discussions continued until 2016.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 18 September 2014, C-0044.\n\n606.\n\nIn December 2014, the MOE proposed that the definition of \"Agreed Investments\" in Appendix 1 to the 2013 Memorandum be amended to include the cost of new connections so as to ensure full recovery of these costs through the mechanisms to compensate for any GRD.656 Inter RAO rejected the proposed amendment and insisted that any costs above the connection fee be compensated by way of a decrease in Telasi's WAPT.657 The MOE rejected this proposal, stating that the connection of new users expands the distribution network and that all associated costs should be treated as investments in that network and reflected in the Distribution Tariff, not the WAPT.658 The MOE reiterated its proposal to include new connection costs within the meaning of \"Agreed Investments\", which Inter RAO rejected.659\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 182; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 87.\n\nLetter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 16 December 2014, C-0053.\n\nLetter from Kaladze to Volkov, dated 29 December 2014, C-0055.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6 45.\n\n607.\n\nCommencing in 2015, the NERC took into account the difference between Telasi's costs and the connection fee paid by a new user as capital expenditures (\"**CAPEX**\") recoverable through Telasi's Distribution Tariffs. However, the Claimants argue that the CAPEX mechanism only partly mitigated Telasi's losses, and that \"the net present value of these payments over such a long period of time [gradually over 25 years] is insufficient to cover Telasi's losses\".660 It appears that commencing in 2019 the NERC adjusted new connection fees to require payment of Telasi's full costs of connection.661\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 155.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 128-129.\n\n***(a) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent acted erratically and obstructively in its response to Telasi's requests to increase new connection fees in order to cover the costs of those connections, thereby causing Telasi an annual loss of several million GEL, commencing in 2013.\n\n609.\n\nThe Claimants say that since 2008, Telasi was obliged to connect new users to its network at its own expense, rather than having users bear that cost. Under the applicable rules, users are required to pay a fixed fee set by the NERC according to the voltage class applicable and the capacity of the connection. Telasi was required to perform all necessary connections at its own expense and was subject to penalties if it did not comply with connection deadlines.662 The Claimants say that the user fees for new connections are inadequate and have not been updated. In addition, the requirement to obtain construction permits and approvals from other authorities is expensive and time consuming. As a result, the Claimants say that Telasi has incurred substantial losses in connecting new users, particularly with respect to the connection of household users.663\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 150.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 150-157, 261; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 195; Tr. Day 1, 128:16-129:16.\n\n610.\n\nAlthough since 2015 the NERC has taken into account Telasi's costs and the connection fee paid as part of Telasi's investments to be compensated through its tariffs, the Claimants say this does not fully compensate for Telasi's losses.664\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 155-156.\n\n611.\n\nThe Claimants say that Inter RAO and Telasi raised the issue repeatedly with the Respondent and were assured during the negotiation of the 2013 Memorandum and at various meetings throughout 2014 and 2016 that the new connection fees would be adjusted to a level that would prevent losses to Telasi.665 The Claimants say that despite the Respondent's representations, Telasi's new connection fees were not adjusted to cover the costs of new connections until 2019.666\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 155-157; Kobtsev I, \u00b6\u00b6 51, 58; Markov I, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45; Mirsiyapov I, \u00b6 81; Letter from Volkov to Kaladze, dated 11 November 2014, C-0049, pp. 1-2; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 193.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 128:21-129:9.\n\n612.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's position that the cost of new connections was expressly excluded from the definition of \"Gross Revenue\" and \"Agreed Investments\" in Appendix 1 of the 2013 Memorandum, the Claimants say this is irrelevant. They say that the Respondent repeatedly represented during and after the signing of the 2013 Memorandum that new connections to Telasi's networks would be paid for by consumers at cost.667 The Claimants explain that although \"Inter RAO and the Government recognized the importance of the new connections issue\u2026 it was too difficult to implement a corresponding mechanism for them in the 2013 Memorandum\".668 The Claimants assert that the Government assured them that Telasi's connections would be made on a no-loss basis and that customers would pay for new connections. They say that \"Georgia refused to put this agreement in writing for political reasons,\"669 but because of the Government's assurances they eventually agreed that the cost of new connections would not be included in the 2013 Memorandum.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 193.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 86.\n\nMirsiyapov II, \u00b6\u00b6 81, 97-101; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 86.\n\n613.\n\nThe Claimants say that despite the NERC's promise to raise the connection fee paid by commercial consumers to a level that would prevent Telasi's losses and address Inter RAO's numerous complaints from 2014-2016, the issue was not resolved and losses continued to accrue.\n\n614.\n\nIt appears that the Claimants' concerns were resolved in 2019. At the hearing, the Claimants stated that the Respondent resolved the issue relating to the cost of new connections in 2019, which demonstrates that it had always been possible to do.670\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 128:16-129:4.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Respondent says that it acted in a predictable, transparent and reasonable manner with respect to Silk Road's investments and denies any breach of the FET standard on account of the treatment of the cost of new connections.671\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 361 and the sources cited there; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 202-203 and the sources cited there.\n\n616.\n\nThe Respondent says that the cost of new connections was excluded from the scope of the 2013 Memorandum at Inter RAO's request.672 Nevertheless, the MOE offered in good faith to treat any costs of new connections above the connection fees as \"Agreed Investments\" and thereby ensured their recovery through the RGR mechanism.673 However, the Claimants rejected this offer. Subsequently, at Telasi's request, the NERC treated the additional costs of new connections as capital expenditures recoverable through Telasi's Distribution Tariffs under the 2014 Methodology.674 The Respondent says that the Claimants' complaint that including the additional costs of new connections as CAPEX in Telasi's Distribution Tariff is insufficient to cover Telasi's costs is unjustified. According to Ms. Milorava, the NERC takes into account the time value of money in adjusting CAPEX to reflect any additional costs that Telasi may have incurred in connecting new customers.675\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 158 and the sources cited there; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6202 and the sources cited there.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 202; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178-184; Valishvili I, \u00b6\u00b6 44-48; Letter from Kaladze to Volkov, dated 29 December 2014, C-0055.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 202; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195; Milorava I, \u00b6 40.\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6 42; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 195; 2014 Methodology, CL-0084, Art. 20.\n\n617.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Claimants do not dispute that the NERC has addressed the new connections issue by treating any additional costs in excess of the fixed connection fee as CAPEX. Further, the Respondent notes that the Claimants are not seeking damages related to the cost of new connections.676\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 203.\n\n618.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent says that the Claimants have effectively abandoned their claim with respect to the cost of new connections.677\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 202-203, 385.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's conduct in response to the Claimants' complaints regarding the cost of new connections does not amount to erratic, non-transparent or unreasonable conduct in breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n620.\n\nIt appears that the issue relating to the cost of new connections was discussed to some extent during the negotiation of the 2013 Memorandum.678 There is a dispute as to whether the Respondent's representatives assured the Claimants that the payment for new connections would be set at a level that would fully cover Telasi's expenses. According to Mr. Bachiashvili, he did not guarantee that Inter RAO would be reimbursed for the cost of every new connection in full. In any event, it appears that it was Inter RAO that proposed excluding the cost of new connections under the definitions of Agreed Investments and Gross Revenue.679\n\nMirsiyapov I, \u00b6 81; Bachiashvili I, \u00b6 36.\n\nDraft Memorandum of 15 December 2012, R-0024, p. 17, Appendix No. 1; Email from Inter RAO to Georgia, dated 10 December 2012, R-0023, p. 12, Appendix No. 1.\n\n621.\n\nSubsequently, although the cost of new connections had been excluded from the scope of the 2013 Memorandum, the MOE offered to treat any costs above the fixed connection fee as \"Agreed Investments\" under the 2013 Memorandum in order to ensure their full recovery through the RGR mechanism.680 The MOE offered to amend the terms of the 2013 Memorandum in order to do this. The Claimants did not agree and maintained that the cost of new connections should be covered by decreasing Telasi's WAPT. In the MOE's view, this was not appropriate as the cost of connecting new customers to the network was not related to the price of electricity and there was, therefore, no basis to reflect those costs in the WAPT. Unfortunately, the Parties were not able to agree.\n\nValishvili I, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45; Letter from Kaladze to Volkov, dated 29 December 2014, C-0055.\n\n622.\n\nSubsequently, under the 2014 Methodology, the difference between Telasi's costs and the connection fee paid by new users is taken into account by the NERC as part of Telasi's investments and is included as an element of Telasi's tariffs. There is a dispute between the Parties as to whether the net present value of the payments received by Telasi is sufficient to cover its losses for the full period of the 2013 Memorandum.681\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 155; Kobtsev I, \u00b6 51; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 195; Milorava I, \u00b6 42. According to Ms. Milorava, the NERC takes into account the time value of money in adjusting CAPEX to reflect any additional costs that Telasi may have incurred in connecting new customers. Further, according to the Respondent, Article 20 of the 2014 Methodology contemplates a correction of the CAPEX to reflect the time value of money.\n\n623.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Respondent acted erratically or unreasonably with respect to the cost of new connections. The MOE acknowledged an issue and attempted to resolve it constructively with the Claimants. Although no agreement was reached, the Claimants accept that the NERC addressed the issue by treating additional costs in excess of the fixed connection fee as an element of capital expenditures. Further, as noted above, it appears that as of 2019, the issue had been resolved.682\n\n*See* Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 128:16-129:4.\n\n624.\n\nFinally, and in any event, the Claimants have not quantified or claimed damages in respect of the cost of new connections. As a result, it is not apparent to the Tribunal what loss, if any, Telasi and the Claimants may have suffered in respect of this claim.\n\n625.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants' claim relating to the costs of new connections.\n\n**ix. The Diversion of the Khrami Companies' Electricity and Sales to Third-Parties**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n626.\n\nFrom the early 2000s through 2017, 100% of the Khrami Companies' generation was sold to Telasi. This represented approximately 15% of Telasi's annual purchases.\n\n627.\n\nIn October 2017, the NERC increased the Khrami Companies' Generation Tariffs by over 19%.683\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 200; NERC Resolution No. 30, CL-0089; NERC Resolution No. 31, CL-0090.\n\n628.\n\nOn 25 December 2017, the NERC provided Telasi's forecasted purchase portfolio for 2018-2020 to Telasi. This purchase portfolio indicated that Telasi would not receive energy from the Khrami Companies between May and July 2018.684 On 27 December 2017, the NERC issued its Resolution No. 48 which contained new Telasi tariffs which were based on the NERC's Annual Energy Plan for 2018. According to the NERC's Plan, for the first time, between May and July 2018, Telasi would not receive any energy from the Khrami Companies.685 According to the NERC's Annual Energy Plan, energy to be supplied from the Khrami Companies was to be replaced with less expensive energy produced by Enguri.\n\nEmail from the NERC to Telasi, 25 December, 2017, R-0077; Milorava II, \u00b6 49.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 169; Kobtsev I, \u00b6 71; NERC Resolution No. 48, CL-0091.\n\n629.\n\nAs a result, the Khrami Companies had to find a buyer for the energy they had intended to sell to Telasi. The Khrami Companies were able to find alternative purchasers. However, the prices they obtained were lower than those they would have obtained from Telasi.686\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 170 and the sources cited there; Kobtsev I, \u00b6 73.\n\n***(a) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent acted erratically and in a non-transparent manner by abruptly diverting the Khrami Companies' output from Telasi across the entire peak season of electric power production from May to August in 2018. As a result, the Khrami Companies had to find alternative purchasers for the balance of 2018, which they did, but at a lower price. As a result, the Khrami Companies suffered losses on their sales in 2018.687\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 168-171, 262-263.\n\n631.\n\nThe Claimants say that the sale of 100% of the Khrami Companies' electricity to Telasi was significant since it provided a predictable market for the Khrami Companies' output. That electricity was less expensive than the average market tariffs and significantly less expensive than the tariffs charged by the COPS, which allowed Telasi to avoid obtaining energy from other, potentially more expensive, sources. In addition, the Claimants say that the supply of all of the Khrami Companies' output to Telasi was an important aspect of the financial models underlying the 2011 and 2013 Memoranda.688\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 168; Markov I, \u00b6 22.\n\n632.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent's abrupt diversion of the Khrami Companies' output required the Khrami Companies to find alternative buyers on short notice, which resulted in lower prices than they would have received from Telasi.689 The Claimants say that as a result of the NERC's sudden and unexplained diversion of their output, the Khrami Companies suffered a loss which they quantify in the amount of USD 1,520,000.690\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 170; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 187. The Claimants say that if the Khrami Companies had not been able to find alternative purchasers, their entire output would have been deemed to acquired by the COPS at the much lower tariff of 1.8 tetri/kWh.\n\nClaimants' Closing Presentation, Slide No. 19; Peer II, \u00b6\u00b6 10.1.1-10.1.5; Peer Hearing Presentation, p. 7.\n\n633.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's position that the NERC set maximum tariffs for the Khrami Companies and was under no obligation to ensure that they could sell their entire output at those tariffs, the Claimants say this confuses the Respondent's obligation to act fairly with its contractual obligations. They say that the diversion of the Khrami Companies' output in 2018 changed the Khrami Companies' business activity, which, for almost 20 years, had been to sell all of their electricity to Telasi. This was consistent with the financial models underlying the 2011 and 2013 Memoranda.691\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 187.\n\n634.\n\nThe Claimants also claim that the NERC did not actually allocate the full amount of Enguri energy to Telasi in accordance with its Annual Energy Plan. As a result, Telasi was forced to purchase the shortfall in volumes from Mktvari HPP and the COPS at higher tariffs.692 The Claimants maintain that the COPS explained to Mr. Kobtsev that the shortfall in Enguri energy was due to Energo-Pro's contract which provided that it had the right to a certain guaranteed volume of energy. The Claimants allege that in the past, Telasi and Energo-Pro had received Enguri energy in proportion to their market share. They suggest that the Respondent prioritized its obligations to Energo-Pro over its obligations to them.693\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 171; Kobtsev I, \u00b6 74.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 171; Kobtsev I, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. Mr. Kobtsev stated that if Telasi and Inter RAO had known in advance that supplies from Enguri would not be provided in the volumes envisaged by the NERC's Annual Energy Plan, they would have been able to find a better solution and minimize losses.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nThe Respondent says that it was under no obligation to direct the Khrami Companies' entire output to Telasi or to ensure that the Khrami Companies could sell their entire output at the maximum generation tariffs set by the NERC.694 Further, the Respondent says that the NERC had provided ample advance notice to the Khrami Companies that Telasi would not receive electricity from them between May and July 2018.695\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 360; Milorava I, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 199.\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6 77; Milorava II, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\n636.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the NERC sets maximum tariffs for the Khrami Companies, and it is not required to ensure that they can sell all of their output at those tariffs. Further, Telasi has no right to receive all of the Khrami Companies' output, nor the obligation to take it, particularly if cheaper energy is available on the market. Also according to the Respondent, the NERC only decided not to allocate all of the Khrami Companies' energy to Telasi after the increase in the Khrami Companies' tariffs in October 2017. In order to avoid an increase in Telasi's Consumer Tariffs, the NERC decided to replace some of the Khrami energy in Telasi's purchase portfolio with cheaper Enguri energy. According to Ms. Milorava, at a meeting in 2016, she explained to Messrs. Volkov and Markov that an increase in the Khrami Companies' tariffs could require replacing some of the Khrami energy in Telasi's purchase portfolio with Enguri energy.696 Subsequently, after the increase in the Khrami Companies' tariffs, on 25 December 2017, the NERC provided to Telasi a copy of Telasi's purchase portfolio for 2018 which indicated that there would be no energy supplied from the Khrami Companies for the months of May through July. Accordingly, Ms. Milorava was of the view that the Khrami Companies had four months to find alternative purchasers which, in her experience, was more than sufficient.697\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6\u00b6 77.\n\nMilorava II, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\n637.\n\nFurther, the Respondent notes that the Khrami Companies were able to find alternative purchasers. It says that neither it nor the NERC has any involvement in, or control over, the prices that generation companies negotiate with purchasers.698 According to Ms. Milorava, it is not clear why the Khrami Companies agreed to sell their energy at a price lower than they would have received from Telasi when the \"reference price\" for electricity at the relevant time of year was higher than the Khrami Companies' marginal tariffs and those companies later sold their electricity to the same buyers at the maximum tariffs.699\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 201.\n\nMilorava II, \u00b6 49; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 201, referring to the Direct Agreements on Electricity (Capacity) Purchased between the Khrami Companies and GEO Servers LLC and GFDC Georgia LLC and BFDC Georgia LLC, all dated in May 2018: Purchase Agreements between Khrami-2 and Geo Servers, dated 15 May 2018, C-0137; Khrami-2 and GFDC Georgia, dated 15 May 2018, C-0138, ; Khrami-1 and Geo Servers, dated 24 May 2018, C-0139, ; Khrami-1 and GFDC BFDC Georgia, dated 24 May 2018, C-0140.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n638.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed all of the evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the diversion of the Khrami Companies' electricity from May through July 2018 amounted to erratic or non-transparent conduct in breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n639.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is no contractual obligation or guarantee under the Khrami SPA or the 2013 Memorandum that the Khrami Companies will be able to sell all of their output to Telasi. The Khrami Companies did supply all of their output to Telasi for a number of years and the 2013 Memorandum reflects that Telasi did and would purchase energy from the Khrami Companies (in Clause 2.3.3 and 2.3.5). However, this did not create a right or guarantee that the Khrami Companies would be able to sell all of their output to Telasi at the maximum tariffs described in the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum. The Claimants appear to acknowledge this when they distinguish between the obligation to act fairly and contractual obligations.\n\n640.\n\nThe Claimants say that when the NERC diverted the Khrami Companies' output, it abruptly changed their business activity in a non-transparent and erratic manner to the detriment of Gardabani.700 In the absence of a contractual obligation or a specific commitment by the Respondent that the Khrami Companies would be able to sell all of their production at the maximum tariffs to Telasi on an ongoing basis, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the NERC's decision not to supply all of the Khrami Companies' output to Telasi was in breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 186-187.\n\n641.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it was within the NERC's discretion to replace some of the Khrami energy in Telasi's purchase portfolio with less expensive Enguri energy in order to limit the effect of the increase in the Khrami Companies' tariffs in 2017 on Telasi's Consumer Tariffs. Further, the Tribunal accepts that this possibility should not have come as a surprise to the Khrami Companies or Telasi. It appears that in 2016, Ms. Milorava had informed the Claimants that an increase in the Khrami Companies' tariffs might require replacing some of the Khrami energy in Telasi's purchase portfolio with Enguri energy. In addition, the purchase portfolio provided to Telasi in December 2017 indicated that Telasi would not receive any energy from the Khrami Companies from May to July 2018. As a result, the Claimants had knowledge of the NERC's intended reallocation of the Khrami Companies' energy four months in advance. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the NERC's decision was erratic, non-transparent or unreasonable.\n\n642.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants' claim must fail.\n\n**C. Impairment - Arbitrary or Unreasonable Treatment**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n643.\n\nArticle 3(1) BIT requires that the Contracting Parties\n\n*\u2026not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.*\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the NERC's application of the 2014 Methodology to Telasi and the Khrami Companies in disregard of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA unreasonably impaired the investments of Silk Road and Gardabani.701\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 268-274; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 194-201; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 130:18-131:10.\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimants say that the ordinary meaning of \"impairment\" means any negative impact or effect and that the ordinary meaning \"measures\" includes action or omission.702 Citing *AES v. Hungary,* the Claimants submit that the ordinary meaning of \"unreasonable\" and \"arbitrary\" is essentially the same: something done capriciously, without reason, and that measures must be both in furtherance of a rational policy and be reasonable in relation to that policy:\n\n*There are two elements that are required to be analysed to determine whether a state's act was unreasonable: the existence of a rational policy; and the reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to the policy.*\n\n*A rational policy is taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.*\n\n*Nevertheless, a rational policy is not enough to justify all the measures taken by a state in its name. The challenged measure must also be reasonable. That is, there needs to be an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it. This has to do with the nature of the measure and the way it is implemented.*703\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 268-269.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 270, quoting from *AES v. Hungary,* CL-0008, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.7-10.3.9. The Claimants also refer to *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, dated 8 October 2009 (\"***EDF v. Romania***\"), CL-0026, \u00b6 303; *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 21 January 2010, CL-0037, \u00b6 262.\n\n646.\n\nThe Claimants say that until the present dispute arose, some considerable time after the conclusion of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum, the Respondent accepted that the tariffs applicable to Telasi and the Khrami Companies would be governed by those Agreements. According to the Claimants, the Respondent subsequently denied that it was bound by those Agreements and applied the 2014 Methodology to the setting of Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs. This caused losses to Silk Road's and Gardabani's investments, which the Respondent failed to compensate.704\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 194.\n\n647.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's refusal to continue to determine Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs in accordance with the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA was without any rational policy basis. The Claimants say that those Agreements were wholly consistent with the policy underlying Georgia's general approach to regulating electricity generation and distribution. In that regard the Claimants say that there is nothing to suggest that the Respondent needed to override their contractual agreements since these shared similar underlying objectives to those of the 2014 Methodology: increasing operational and management efficiency; supporting stable and reliable functioning of the utilities; ensuring tariffs that are transparent, stable and fair for the utility; and covering the costs of the utility with funds received from consumers in proportion to costs incurred. The Claimants say that the goals of the 2014 Methodology to have tariffs that are \"transparent\", \"stable\", and \"fair\" were undermined by displacing the long-term rules for setting and adjusting Telasi's and the Khrami Companies' tariffs and the stability and predictability they were designed to achieve.705\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 196-197; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 130:18-131:4.\n\n648.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that even if the Respondent's underlying policy goals were consistent with the Parties' contractual arrangements (which they deny), the Respondent acted unreasonably when it imposed a disproportionate burden on Silk Road and Gardabani. According to the Claimants, proportionality requires that a state's conduct must not be \"\u2026excessive considering the relative weight of each interest involved\".706 The Claimants say that the application of the 2014 Methodology to Telasi and the Khrami Companies unilaterally terminated the Parties' agreements, prioritizing the Respondent's interest in implementing the 2014 Methodology in disregard of the Claimants' rights under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA.707\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 198, quoting from *Electrabel v. Hungary*, RL-0023, \u00b6 179.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 198-199.\n\n649.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's defence that the application of the 2014 Methodology was completely within the control of the NERC which is independent of the Government. They say that the NERC's conduct is undisputedly attributable to the state. Further, the NERC's alleged independence does not provide any policy justification for the Respondent's conduct, whether the NERC acted alone or in concert with other government agencies, its actions were out of proportion with any rational policy goal.708\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 195.\n\n650.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that their claim of unreasonable impairment is separate and distinct from their claim of breach of the Respondent's obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. Therefore, whether a measure was reasonable under the treaty is unrelated to Silk Road's and Gardabani's expectations. In this regard, the Claimants say that their alleged expectations regarding Telasi's financial position under the 2013 Memorandum is irrelevant to a claim of impairment which sanctions any unreasonable impairment of \"the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of investments.\n\n651.\n\nWith respect to Silk Road's claim, the Claimants say that when Telasi earned less revenue than would have been generated under the 2013 Memorandum's tariff-related provisions, Silk Road's rights to operate, enjoy and use its investment were impaired. In any event, the Claimants say that the Respondent's view of the Claimants' and Silk Road's expectations in 2013 is incorrect. Further, the Claimants say that they have demonstrated that as a result of the application of the 2014 Methodology, Telasi's position was worse than what had been expected when the 2013 Memorandum was concluded.709\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 200.\n\n652.\n\nWith respect to Gardabani's claim, the Claimants reject the Respondent's position that Gardabani's investments were not unreasonably impaired because the NERC adjusted the Khrami Companies' tariffs in 2017 and the Khrami Companies did not challenge that decision. The Claimants say that the Khrami Companies' conduct in the tariff-setting process is not relevant to an unreasonable impairment claim. Further, and in any event, they say that neither Gardabani nor the Khrami Companies agreed to the adjustments implemented by the NERC in its Resolutions Nos. 30 and 31 and that they made this clear before, during and after the public hearing at which those Resolutions were adopted.710\n\n*Id*.,\u00b6\u00b6 74-77, 172, 201.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it impaired Silk Road or Gardabani's investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\n\n654.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute the Claimants' articulation of the scope of the BIT's impairment clause. The ordinary meaning of \"impairment\" means any negative impact or effect on the operation, management, maintenance, use or disposal of investments, while \"measures\" include actions or omissions. \"Unreasonable\" and \"arbitrary\" mean \"capriciously, without reason\"; \"a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose\u2026not based on legal standards but on discretion\u2026taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker; or\u2026taken in willful disregard of due process\u2026\".711\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 387, quoting *EDF v. Romania*, CL-0026, \u00b6 303.\n\n655.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal must refrain from second-guessing policy makers and substituting their own judgment for that of Georgia about effective regulatory policy.712 If the Tribunal does not agree with Georgia's policy decision, that alone is not a basis to conclude that the measure is arbitrary or unreasonable. The standard is not one of perfection:\n\n*a BIT may \u2026 not be invoked each time the law is flawed or not fully or properly implemented by a state. Some attempt to balance the interests of the various constituents within a country, some measure of inefficiency, a degree of trial and error, a modicum of human imperfection must be overstepped before a party may complain of a violation of a BIT.*713\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award, dated 16 September 2003, RL-0080, \u00b6 20.33; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, dated 26 January 2006, RL-0081, \u00b6 160; *Investmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, dated 26 June 2009 (\"***Investmart v. Czech Republic***\"), CL-0035, \u00b6 501.\n\n*E.g.,* *Eastern Sugar B.V. (Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, SCC No. 088/2004, Partial Award, dated 27 March 2007, RL-0082, \u00b6 272.\n\n656.\n\nFactually, the Respondent relies on the same rationale as it advances with respect to the FET claims to argue that the Claimants' claims that its measures were unreasonable or discriminatory are baseless. In particular, the Respondent says that the Claimants knew that the NERC had total control over the approval of tariffs; the Claimants could not have expected that the 2013 Memorandum tariffs would continue to apply after the 2014 Methodology was adopted; Telasi is no worse off than it expected to be at the time of signature of the 2013 Memorandum; and the NERC adjusted the Khrami Companies' tariffs in accordance with the agreed adjustment mechanisms and any dispute in that regard falls below the threshold for a violation of the Treaty.714\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 363-364.\n\n657.\n\nThe Respondent says that it did not treat Silk Road or Telasi unreasonably. They say that the 2014 Methodology was developed to bring Georgian legislation in line with EU law and to create transparent and predictable tariff-setting rules for all regulated companies in Georgia. The Methodology established detailed rules aimed at ensuring that electricity companies could cover their justified costs and make a reasonable return on their investment. It also provides for adjustment mechanisms to account for evolving market conditions.715 Further, the development of the 2014 Methodology was an open and transparent process in which Telasi's representatives were involved.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 395.\n\n658.\n\nThe Respondent says that its conduct was clearly guided by a legitimate public policy.716 The Respondent says that the Claimants were aware that the NERC would set its tariffs in accordance with the 2014 Methodology when Telasi submitted its tariff application in July 2015. The 2014 Methodology was applied in a transparent manner and set stable and fair tariffs for Telasi.717\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 393.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 394.\n\n659.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the adoption and implementation of the 2014 Methodology did not impose a disproportionate burden on Telasi, as alleged by the Claimants. It says that this is confirmed by Dr. Moselle's analysis of Telasi's financial performance and the indicators set out in Appendix No. 2 to the 2013 Memorandum, which shows that Telasi's revenues were significantly higher than forecasted and better than Silk Road had expected when it entered in to the 2013 Memorandum.718\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 395-397.\n\n660.\n\nWith respect to the Khrami Companies, the Respondent says that the NERC adjusted their generation tariffs pursuant to the terms of the Khrami SPA and Resolution No. 5 in 2017. They say that the only dispute between the Parties is whether the NERC correctly interpreted the adjustment provisions in Clause 2 of Appendix No. 1 of the Khrami SPA. It says that even if the NERC's interpretation was incorrect, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that the NERC's decisions were arbitrary or unreasonable. Rather, its decisions were taken in good faith following an open and transparent process.719\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 398.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the Parties' respective positions in the complex circumstances of this case, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not unreasonably impair the investments of Silk Road and Gardabani. While in the SCC Arbitration, the Respondents' conduct was found to amount to breaches of contract, it was not unreasonable or arbitrary and, therefore, does not amount to impairment by unreasonable measures of Silk Road's and Gardabani's investments.\n\n662.\n\nIn addressing the Claimants' claims of unreasonable impairment, the Tribunal considers it important to bear in mind the Parties' different interpretations of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA.720 As the Tribunal has noted, the Parties' Agreements, and the 2013 Memorandum in particular, are complex and ambiguous in various respects. This required an extensive interpretive exercise in the SCC Partial Award on Liability. An important element of the Tribunal's interpretation of the relevant Agreements is that neither contains a stabilization clause freezing the regulatory regime at the relevant dates or prohibiting modifications of their tariff-related provisions. Rather, they provided contractual remedies of compensation for damage or losses in the event of a change of legislation or regulation (in the case of the 2013 Memorandum) or the non-application or alteration of tariffs and conditions of their adjustment (in the case of the Khrami SPA). While the Claimants maintain that the Respondent denied that it was bound by these Agreements and effectively terminated them, the Respondent denies this and says that the issue between the Parties is the interpretation of the Agreements. While the Tribunal ultimately determined in the SCC Arbitration that the Claimants' interpretation was correct, the Respondents' interpretation was not unreasonable.\n\nThe differing interpretations of these Agreements is also relevant to the implementing resolutions adopted by NERC.\n\n663.\n\nThe Tribunal's review of the adoption of 2014 Methodology indicates that it was developed to bring Georgian legislation in line with EU law and to create tariff-setting rules for all regulated entities in Georgia. The Methodology seeks to balance the interests of electricity companies and consumers and is in line with EU legislation and practices.721 In the Tribunal's view, the 2014 Methodology and the Amended 2014 Methodology reflect a legitimate public policy objective. Further, the development of the Methodology and its implementation were accomplished by way of a transparent process in which the Claimants' representatives participated. In the Tribunal's view, the NERC's application of the 2014 Methodology to both Telasi and the Khrami Companies was rationally connected to the Respondent's policy of implementing its tariff-setting rules in line with EU legislation and practice. It was also performed with notice to the Claimants.\n\nMilorava I, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 36; Moselle I, \u00b6\u00b6 5.6-5.20; Moselle II, \u00b6\u00b6 7.21-7.24.\n\n664.\n\nWith respect to the application of the 2014 Methodology to Telasi, the Tribunal does not consider that it posed a disproportionate burden. It appears that under the 2014 Methodology, Telasi was able to cover its costs and earn a profit.722 While this profit is lower than would have been achieved under the provisions of the 2013 Memorandum, and therefore, Telasi's position under the 2014 Methodology was worse than under the provisions of the Memorandum as interpreted by the Tribunal, this is an issue of contractual interpretation and remedy. This does not amount to unreasonable or arbitrary treatment under Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n*See* SCC Partial Award on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 644-646.\n\n665.\n\nWith respect to Gardabani's claim relating to the Khrami Companies, the Tribunal found in the Partial Award on Liability that due to the NERC's refusal to accept the Khrami Companies' adjustment applications in 2016, the Respondent breached the terms of Clause 5.2.2 and Clause 2 of Annex #1 of the Khrami SPA. However, this does not amount to unreasonable or arbitrary conduct constituting impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures under Article 3 of the BIT. The determination of whether or not the Khrami Companies were required to file their tariff adjustment application in the format compliant with the 2014 Methodology was not straightforward. In the Tribunal's view, the NERC's insistence that the application had to be made pursuant to the 2014 Methodology, while ultimately found incorrect, was not unreasonable in the circumstances. The NERC subsequently reconsidered its position that it could not address the Khrami Companies' applications under Annex #1 of the Khrami SPA and Resolution No. 5 of 2011 and adjusted the Khrami Companies' tariffs in accordance with its interpretation of those provisions. While the Tribunal has found in the SCC Arbitration that the NERC's interpretation and application of the adjustment provisions of Clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of Annex #1 of the Khrami SPA was incorrect, in light of the ambiguity and difficulty in interpreting those clauses, the Tribunal has concluded that the NERC's interpretation at the time and the Respondent's position in the Arbitrations was reasonable. Further, the NERC appears to have made its determination in good faith by way of a transparent, deliberative process.723\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 179-184, 398.\n\n666.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants' claim of unreasonable impairment of their investments must fail.\n\n**D. The Umbrella Clause**\n--------------------------\n\n667.\n\nArticle 3(4) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nThe Claimants allege Georgia failed to observe its contractual and other binding commitments concerning specific investments in breach of Article 3(4) of the BIT.724\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 275-281; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 202-206.\n\n669.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Article 3(4) is broad, and requires Georgia to observe \"any obligation\", of whatever legal source and nature \u2013 contractual, regulatory or legislative obligations \u2013 it entered into with regard to the investments of Gardabani (the Khrami Companies) and Silk Road (Telasi).725 The Claimants emphasise that the ordinary meaning of Article 3(4) of the BIT is an imperative and categorical obligation on Georgia to observe all obligations entered into with regard to the investments of qualifying investors. The Claimants note that in *SGS v. Philippines,* the Tribunal found that the breach by a state organ of a contractual obligation relating to a qualifying investment was in breach of the umbrella clause in the Swiss Confederation \u2013 Republic of the Philippines Bilateral Investment Treaty.726\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 276-277, citing the VCLT, as well as *Garanti Koza LLP v.

The Claimants say that the Respondent's reference to *WNC v. Czech Republic* disregards \"the obvious (and dispositive) point that the umbrella clause in that case was narrow, expressly covering only 'specific agreements' between the claimant and the host State\".729\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 205, citing *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v.

The Claimants contrast the language of the BIT in this case with other bilateral investment treaties, for example, between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Yemen, CL-0158, Art. 9, Agreement for the Promotion of Protection of Investment between the Republic of Austria and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, CL-0157, Art. 11(1).\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 204, fn 490, citing *WNC Factoring v.

Czech Republic***\"), RL-0026, \u00b6 320.\n\n671.\n\nThe Claimants submit that several tribunals have held that a clause similar to Article 3(4) of the BIT permits an investor to pursue claims based on obligations undertaken in favour of an investment vehicle owned by the Claimant. For instance, in *EDF v. Argentina*, the tribunal accepted an umbrella clause claim founded on a concession agreement with the claimant's subsidiary.730 Similarly, in *Sempra Energy v. Argentina*, the tribunal held that an umbrella clause was breached where a gas transportation license in favour of the claimants' indirect subsidiaries had been amended unilaterally.731 Further, in *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, debt instruments issued to the claimant's subsidiary were considered as guaranteed by the umbrella clause.732 The Claimants point out that, like the umbrella clause applicable in this case, the relevant provision of the applicable treaty in all three of these cases required Argentina to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\".\n\n*EDF v. Argentina,* CL-0131, \u00b6\u00b6 938-942; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 205.\n\n*Sempra Energy v. Argentina*, CL-0150, \u00b6 312; *see also*, *Enron v.

Argentina,* CL-0023, \u00b6 302: the umbrella clause was not found to have been breached, on the facts.\n\n672.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the umbrella clause applies to both contractual and non-contractual obligations, so long as the State has an existing obligation and the obligation was entered into by the State toward the claimant specifically.733 Whether an obligation exists and a breach has occurred are issues to be determined according to the law governing the obligation.734 The Claimants submit that Georgia breached both contractual and non-contractual obligations. They say that the protected contractual obligations in this case include those in the 2011 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA, and the 2013 Memorandum, governed by Georgian law. The non-contractual obligations are contained in the NERC's implementing resolutions: NERC Resolution No. 5 of 7 April 2011 in the case of the Khrami Companies' tariffs; and NERC Resolution No. 3 of 3 April 2013 in the case of Telasi's tariffs.735\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 278.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 131:8-10.\n\n673.\n\nWith respect to the alleged contractual obligations owed to Gardabani, the Claimants say there is no issue since Gardabani is a Party to the Khrami SPA. Insofar as Silk Road is concerned, the Claimants say that Article 3(4) of the BITx refers to \"any obligation [the State] may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other contracting party\". The obligation in question need only be entered into with regard to investments and not directly \"with investors\". Other treaties may use a narrower definition. However, the Claimants say that the State Parties to the BIT consciously chose the language of Article 3(4) of the BIT.736 Therefore, the Respondent's argument that Article 3(4) of the BIT requires privity between the Claimants and the state has no basis.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 131:17-132:8.\n\n674.\n\nWith respect to the alleged non-contractual breaches, the Claimants say that Georgia also breached Article 3(4) when it resiled from the tariff terms applicable to Telasi under NERC Resolution No. 3 and to the Khrami Companies under NERC Resolution No. 5.737 The Claimants say that a State's commitments in the form of a law or a regulation can give rise to a breach of the umbrella clause if the commitment is firm and directed specifically towards the investor.738 They say that the case here is clear since the regulatory framework established in the NERC resolutions were directed specifically at Telasi and the Khrami Companies respectively and were introduced, together with the contractual agreements on which they were based, to induce Silk Road to enter into the 2013 Memorandum and Gardabani to enter into the Khrami SPA. Accordingly, the Respondent failed to observe its obligations when the NERC applied the tariff-setting provisions of the 2014 Methodology to Telasi and the Khrami Companies, overriding the commitments contained in NERC Resolutions Nos. 3 and 5.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 281.\n\n*Ibid*. The Claimants refer to the decision in *LG&E v. Argentina*, CL-0038, \u00b6 175.\n\n675.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that it complied with all the obligations under the 2013 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and the NERC's Resolutions, the Claimants say that this repeats the Respondent's defences to its contractual claims brought by Gardabani, Telasi and Inter RAO in the SCC Arbitration. The Claimants say that the Respondent breached its obligations under the umbrella clause for the same reasons as it breached its contractual obligations under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA.739\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 207.\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n676.\n\nThe Respondent says that there is no basis under the 2013 Memorandum and the NERC's Resolutions Nos. 3 and 5 for an umbrella clause claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT because any obligations that may have undertaken under those instruments are not owed to Silk Road or Gardabani.740\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 367-373; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 400-409.\n\n677.\n\nThe Respondent says that any obligation under Article 3(4) of the BIT is limited to \"\u2026 any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other contracting party\". According to the Respondent, the term \"obligation\" denotes an \"obligor-obligee relationship\", which preconditions any claims to the existence of a legal relationship between the claimant and the State. As neither Silk Road nor Gardabani are parties to the 2013 Memorandum, they are not obligees of any direct obligations owed by Georgia.741 Similarly, insofar as any obligations arise out of the NERC's Resolutions Nos. 3 and 5 are concerned, these run to Telasi and the Khrami Companies, respectively, and not to their parent companies.742\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 367; *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability (\"***Burlington v. Ecuador***\"), dated 14 December 2012, CL-0016, \u00b6 214. The parties to the 2013 Memorandum are: the Government of Georgia, and the Partnership Fund on one side and Inter RAO, Telasi, Mtkvari and Khrami-1 and Khrami-2.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 373.\n\n678.\n\nThe Respondent refers to several cases that interpret umbrella clauses similar to Article 3(4) of the BIT, which it says confirm that the obligation must be entered into by the state towards the claimant specifically, and not just to a claimant's subsidiary.743 The Respondent notes that each of these cases considers umbrella clauses that, like the one at issue in this case, cover \"any obligation\u2026with regard to investments\". Further, the Respondent contends that Georgian law applies to whether an obligation exists and that the Claimants have not alleged, nor established, that under that law a non-signatory parent or subsidiary of a contracting party may directly enforce its parent's or subsidiary's contractual rights.744 Therefore, Silk Road's and Gardabani's umbrella law claims, as they relate to the 2013 Memorandum and NERC Resolutions Nos. 3 and 5, must fail because there is no undertaking to be honoured by Georgia to either parent company.\n\n*See* Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 403-408, fns 800-812; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 368-372, citing *Azurix v. Argentina*, CL-0011, \u00b6 384; *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award, dated 6 February 2007 (\"***Siemens v. Argentina***\"), CL-0056, \u00b6\u00b6 204-205; *CMS v.

In respect of this claim, Georgia submits that it has not violated its obligations under the Khrami SPA and relies on its submissions in the SCC Arbitration in this regard.745\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 374; Respondents' Rejoinder, Sections IV.B and IV.D, \u00b6 410.\n\n680.\n\nIn support of the privity requirement, the Respondent relies on the *WNC v. Czech Republic* award for the general proposition that tribunals have consistently resolved that they have no jurisdiction to consider umbrella clause claims where the contractual obligations do not run to the claimants*.*746 The Respondent contests the distinction drawn by the Claimants on the basis of the umbrella clause in that case as expressly covering only \"specific agreements between the claimant and the host State\". It says that, in *obiter*, the *WNC* tribunal found that it \"would uphold the requirement of privity even for generally worded umbrella clauses\" because they \"are intended to give effect to legal commitments entered into by the host State with regard to investments, not to change their scope or content\".747\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 372; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 405-406.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 405, citing *WNC v. Czech Republic,* RL-0026, \u00b6 335.\n\n681.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the *WNC* tribunal distinguished the 2008 award in *Continental Casualty* and the 2012 award in *EDF v. Argentina*, relied on by the Claimants here. With respect to *Continental Casualty*'s finding that \"[obligations] may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors themselves, so that an undertaking by the host State748 with a subsidiary \u2026 is not in principle excluded\", the Respondent notes that the tribunal stated that this \"should not upset the otherwise consistent jurisprudence on the privity objection\".749 With respect to *EDF v. Argentina*, the Respondent says that the *WNC* tribunal stated that \"the Concession Agreement in the *EDF v. Argentina* case imposed a positive contractual obligation on the claimant companies not to transfer shares without prior consent\" and thus the claimant companies \"were parties to the transactions, not merely beneficiaries\".750\n\n*Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, CL-0023, \u00b6297.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 407, citing *WNC v. Czech Republic*, RL-0026, \u00b6 333. The Respondent refers to the *WNC* tribunal's explanation as follows:  \n*First, in making this statement, the tribunal was referring to obligations of the host state in general and not contractual promises in particular. Second, the tribunal did not ultimately pursue its investigation of whether contractual obligations of Argentina were justiciable under the umbrella clause because it had already decided Argentina could rely on the defence of necessity with respect to those obligations.' As such, it did not need to conduct a full analysis of the issue or engage with cases that had resolved similar questions. Finally, it commented that the contracts in question \"could ... be considered as guaranteed by the umbrella clause, subject to the caveat that they were not directed to foreign investors nor specifically addressed to their investments'. Accordingly, it is not apparent that the contracts would have fallen under the umbrella clause even if the tribunal had taken this question to its conclusion.*\n\n*WNC v. Czech Republic*, RL-0026, \u00b6 339.\n\n682.\n\nThe Respondent says that the tribunal in *Duke Energy,* on which the Claimants rely, rejected an umbrella clause claim on the basis that the obligation alleged to have been breached was in a government decree, and it did not run to the claimant, but rather its subsidiary.751 Similarly, the Respondent says that the annulment committee in *CMS* held that because the obligations under the host State's law were obligations to a subsidiary of the claimant, and not to the claimant itself, the claimants had no right to enforce them. In the Respondent's view, the umbrella clause cannot transform the parties, the underlying legal instrument or the applicable law. Rather, it concerns consensual, specific obligations directed at particular persons, arising independently of the BIT itself (i.e., under the law of the host State or possibly under international law).752\n\n*Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, CL-0025, \u00b6 313, referring to Art. II(3)(c) of the US-Ecuador BIT: \"each party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\".\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 403, referring to *CMS v. Argentina*, RL-0025, \u00b6\u00b6 89-100, especially 95(a)-(d).\n\n683.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that not every breach of contract automatically amounts to a breach of an umbrella clause since these are intended to protect an investor's vested rights against the exercise of sovereign authority. It maintains that there is no evidence that the breaches of contract identified in the Partial Award on Liability were the result of its use or abuse of its sovereign authority such as to give rise to breaches of the umbrella clause.753\n\nRespondents' Observations on the Partial Award, p. 5.\n\n684.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent says it observed all of its obligations in relation to Silk Road and Gardabani's Investments under the 2013 Memorandum, Khrami SPA and the NERC Resolutions Nos. 3 and 5.754\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to have contested that a contractual obligation exists between it and Gardabani under the Khrami SPA. The Parties to the Khrami SPA include: the Government of Georgia, the MOE, and the SSB on one side and Gardabani on the other.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n685.\n\nThe Tribunal's first task is to determine the scope of the umbrella clause. The Tribunal notes that Article 3(4) of the BIT must be interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, which sets out the general customary international law rules of treaty interpretation.\n\n686.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT requires a treaty to be interpreted in good faith, according to the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms used in that treaty, in the context and taking into account the object and purpose of the treaty. Article 32 of the VCLT permits recourse to supplementary means of interpretation in order to confirm the meaning derived by application of Article 31 or to resolve an ambiguity.\n\n687.\n\nPursuant to its plain meaning, Article 3(4) of the BIT is intended to ensure that a Contracting Party observes \"\u2026any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other contracting party\". The use of the word \"any\" suggests that the Contracting Parties intended the protection provided in Article 3(4) to apply broadly to any obligation. There is no limitation of the scope of relevant obligations to international obligations, contractual or non-contractual obligations. On a plain meaning of the language, the obligations falling within the scope of protection could be any of these. However, Article 3(4) goes on to provide that the obligation is one \"\u2026entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other contracting party\". This language suggests that a certain degree of specificity must exist in that it must be with regard to or relate to investments of nationals. Nevertheless, unlike the language used in other treaties, the scope of protection is not limited to obligations entered into \"with\" an investor or an investment of an755 investor.\n\n*See e.g*., Article 10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\n688.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the broad language of Article 3(4) of the BIT and its plain meaning are consistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty which, as stated in the preamble to the BIT, is to \"extend and intensify the economic relations\" between the two States and agree upon the treatment to be provided to investments of nationals of the Contracting Parties. The preamble of the BIT recognizes \"\u2026 that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable treatment of investments is desirable\". Providing assurances with regard to the respect or performance of obligations assumed by the host State with regard to specific investments supports the object and purpose of the Treaty.756\n\nAlthough the issue was not argued by the Parties, the Tribunal sees no relevant distinction between the use of the terms \"observe\" or \"perform\" or other possible terms such as \"respect\" or \"comply with\" in Article 3(4). As the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* found in the context of an umbrella clause which provided that each Contracting Party was required to \"observe any obligation it has assumed with regard to specific investments\u2026\". It went on to state: \"Article X (2) addresses not the *scope* of the commitments entered into with regard to specific investments but the *performance* of these obligations, once they are ascertained. It is a conceivable function of a provision such as Article X (2) of the Swiss-Philippines BIT to provide assurances to foreign investors with regard to the performance of obligations assumed by the host State under its own law with regard to specific investments \u2013 in effect, to help secure the rule of law in relation to investment protection. In the Tribunal's view, this is the proper interpretation of Article X (2). *See* *SGS v. Philippines*, CL-0055, \u00b6\u00b6126 \u2013 127.\n\n689.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that a contractual obligation entered into by a Contracting Party falls within the scope of a protected obligation. The Claimants maintain that in the case of a contractual obligation, there need not be privity between the state and the investment of a national. The Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that there must be privity of contract and that only a party to the contract may bring a claim pursuant to the umbrella clause. The Parties have submitted a number of awards which they say support their respective positions. In the Tribunal's view, the language of Article 3(4) does not require a direct contractual relationship between a contracting party and the investment of a national. Rather, the obligation must be \"with regard to\" the investment of a national. As will be discussed below, the Tribunal finds that the language of the 2013 Memorandum was intended to protect not only the signatories but also any member of the Inter RAO Group, which would include both Silk Road and Gardabani. Further, and in any event, the Tribunal notes that Gardabani's claim is based on the provisions of the Khrami SPA, to which it is a signatory.\n\n690.\n\nThe other issue between the Parties regarding the scope of Article 3(4) of the BIT is whether it is limited to contractual obligations. Again, the Parties have made reference to a number of arbitral awards which address this question. The Claimants say that non-contractual obligations may trigger a breach of an umbrella clause. For example, they say that breach of a commitment contained in a law or regulation may constitute a violation of the umbrella clause providing the obligation or commitment in question is firm and directed specifically towards the investor.757 The Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that an obligation covered by Article 3(4) of the BIT requires the existence of a legal relationship between the claimant and Georgia. As noted above, the Respondent says that any obligation enforceable under the umbrella clause must be assumed to have been entered into by the state towards the claimant specifically. Therefore, a claimant which is not a party to a contract with the state cannot base an umbrella law claim on the basis of the contract.758 Insofar as an obligation which may arise from a law or regulation is concerned, the Respondent says that any such obligation which may arise, must run specifically to the claimant itself.759\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 279-281: *AES v. Kazakhstan*, CL-0006 / RL-0037, \u00b6 333; *Investmart v. Czech Republic*, CL-0035, \u00b6 526; *Enron v. Argentina* , CL-0031, \u00b6 274; *Continental Casualty v. Argentina,* CL-0023, \u00b6\u00b6 298-301; *LG&E v. Argentina*, CL-0038, \u00b6 175.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 367-373; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 401-409; *Azurix v.

Ecuador*, CL-0025, \u00b6\u00b6 317-323.\n\n691.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, legislation or regulations are capable of creating obligations that are protected by an umbrella clause. However, as in the case of contractual obligations, an obligation contained in a law or regulation must have been entered into or undertaken by the state \"with regard to investments\" of a claimant. The obligation must be made with respect to an identifiable investment of a qualifying investor. A general regulatory statute will not normally contain a sufficiently specific commitment or obligation. In this case, the relevant regulations are NERC Resolution No. 3 of 3 April 2013 and NERC Resolution No. 5 of 11 April 2011.\n\n692.\n\nFinally, in their Observations of 14 May 2021 on the Partial Award on Liability in the SCC Arbitration, the Respondents submitted that umbrella clauses serve to protect an investor's vested rights against uses and abuses of sovereign authority and that the breaches of contract identified in the Partial Award on Liability were not the result of Georgia's use and abuse of its sovereign authority such as to rise to breaches of the umbrella clause.760 Consistent with the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 3(4), above, the scope of this provision covers any failure to observe any obligation entered into with regard to investments of the Claimants. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no requirement for the use or abuse of sovereign authority in order to give rise to a breach of the umbrella clause in this case. Further, the Tribunal notes that at the root of the obligation to compensate Silk Road and Gardabani was the exercise of regulatory powers to adopt and apply new tariff regulations.\n\nRespondents' Observations on the Partial Award on Liability, p.5.\n\na.  **Telasi's Claim**\n----------------------\n\n693.\n\nSilk Road pursued its claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT\u00a0on the basis that the Respondent failed to observe its contractual obligations under the 2013 Memorandum by failing to compensate for losses caused by a change in legislation which made its position in Georgia worse as compared to the position at the date of the signature of the Memorandum. It also claims that when it resiled from the tariff terms applicable to Telasi under NERC Resolution No. 3, it also breached Article 3(4) of the BIT.761 In each case, Silk Road says that the Respondent failed to observe an obligation entered into specifically towards it.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\n694.\n\nSilk Road says that the language of Article 3(4) of the BIT is broad and extends to any obligation it entered into with regard to its investment in Telasi. Although it is not a signatory to the 2013 Memorandum, it says that it falls within the scope of protection offered by Article 3(4) of the BIT for a failure by Georgia to observe its contractual obligation contained in the 2013 Memorandum. With respect to NERC Resolution No. 3, Silk Road appears to argue that when the NERC applied the terms of the 2014 Methodology to Telasi, it failed to observe the obligation to set and adjust Telasi's tariffs pursuant to Clause 2 of the 2013 Memorandum.762\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 281; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 203.\n\n695.\n\nThe Respondent says that Silk Road cannot invoke Article 3(4) of the BIT because it is not a party to the 2013 Memorandum and any obligations under the NERC's Resolution No. 3 applies only to Telasi.763\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 373; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 400, 409. The Respondent takes a similar position with respect to Gardabani's claim.\n\n696.\n\nAs indicated above, in the Tribunal's view, the broad language of Article 3(4) of the BIT does not limit the scope of protected obligations to those entered into directly with a claimant. Rather, the relevant obligation need only be entered into by the state with regard to investments provided the obligation was entered into towards the claimant specifically. In this case, the Tribunal finds that the obligation contained in Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum was entered into towards Silk Road although it was not a signatory to the Memorandum.\n\n697.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls the language of Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum:\n\n*5.2. In the event that, following the signing of this Memorandum, any amendments have been made to the legislation of Georgia, making the position of Inter RAO or of any Inter RAO Group company in Georgia worse as compared to the position as of the date of signing of this Memorandum, the Government of Georgia shall compensate Inter RAO or the relevant Inter RAO Group company in Georgia for all losses caused by such a change in the legislation, including by means of an increase of the Consumer Tariff of Telasi, JSC in accordance with section 2.2.2.*\n\n698.\n\nThis provision contains an obligation towards Inter RAO or any member of the Inter RAO Group in Georgia, which includes Silk Road which holds 75.11% of Telasi's shares. Further, as a 25% shareholder of Telasi, the Respondent must be taken to be aware of the majority shareholder of Telasi, Silk Road. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that in the 1998 Telasi SPA, the Respondent sold 75% of the shares of Telasi to AES Silk Road Holdings BV.764 Further, Silk Road was identified as the \"investor\" in the 2010 Memorandum of Intent entered into between the Government and the MOE and Inter RAO and Silk Road.765\n\nTelasi SPA, C-0001. Clause 20 of the Telasi SPA provided for compensation to AES Silk Road for a period of 10 years in respect of losses caused to Telasi by way of specified changes of law. AES Silk Road Holdings B.V. was then purchased by Inter RAO in 2003.\n\n2010 Memorandum, C-0006 / R-0018. Clause 1.3.3.1 of the Memorandum of Intent refers to the joint ownership of Telasi by Georgia and the investor, Silk Road. Reference was also made to Silk Road in Clause 1.6 of the 2007 Memorandum, C-0005 / R-0015, and in Clause 1.1.1 of the 2011 Memorandum, C-0015 / R-0019.\n\n699.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Respondent was aware that Silk Road was the majority shareholder of Telasi and a member of the Inter RAO Group and it entered into an obligation with regard to any member of the Inter RAO Group. In the Tribunal's view, the obligation contained in Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum to compensate Inter RAO or Inter RAO Group company was entered into with regard to Silk Road's investment in Telasi for the purposes of Article 3(4) of the BIT.\n\n700.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Respondent's position that the Claimants have not demonstrated that, under Georgian law, a non-signatory parent or subsidiary of the contracting party may directly enforce its parent or subsidiary's contractual rights. In the Tribunal's view, the right to claim protection under Article 3(4) of the BIT depends on the language of the treaty and international law, which in the Tribunal's view, permits Silk Road to bring its claim.\n\n701.\n\nAs indicated above, in the SCC Arbitration the Tribunal determined the obligation to compensate that the Respondent was required to observe. Having failed to observe that obligation and compensate Silk Road, the Respondent has breached its obligation entered into in the 2013 Memorandum. Accordingly, the Respondent has failed to observe its obligation entered into with respect to Silk Road's investment, Telasi.\n\n702.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Tribunal need not address Silk Road's argument that the Respondent also failed to observe an obligation contained in NERC Resolution No. 3. Nevertheless, the Tribunal recalls that the obligation or commitment undertaken by the Respondents was to compensate for any losses flowing from a change in the legislation which made the position of Inter RAO or any Inter RAO Group company in Georgia worse as compared to the position as of the date of the signature of the 2013 Memorandum. While NERC Resolution No. 3 was implemented to give effect to the tariffs agreed in the 2013 Memorandum, it does not provide that there will be no change in Telasi's tariffs nor does it address the question of compensation in the event this occurs.\n\nb.  **Gardabani's Claim**\n-------------------------\n\n703.\n\nGardabani's primary claim alleges that the Respondent failed to observe the obligation it owed to it pursuant to Khrami SPA. Gardabani also alleges the Respondent failed to observe the obligation contained in NERC Resolution No. 5 which implemented the tariffs agreed in the Khrami SPA. As there is no dispute that Gardabani is a party to the Khrami SPA, the Tribunal need not consider the second basis for the claim, nor the Respondent's defence as it relates to it.766\n\nThe Respondent argued that Gardabani had no basis for a claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT since it was not a signatory to the 2013 Memorandum (which, in addition to Telasi's tariffs and conditions of adjustment, also incorporated Khrami's tariffs and the conditions of their adjustment set out in Annex #1 to the Khrami SPA). Further, the Respondent also alleged that insofar as NERC Resolution No. 5 is concerned, there is no obligation or undertaking by it with respect to Gardabani since any obligation runs to the Khrami Companies and not Gardabani. *See* Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 409.\n\n704.\n\nWith respect to its obligations under the Khrami SPA, the Respondent says that it did not breach any of these.767 In this regard, the Respondent maintains that having failed to cause the Khrami Companies to submit compliant tariff applications, Gardabani is not entitled to claim compensation for their non-adjustment and that, in any event, the Khrami Companies waived their right to a tariff adjustment in 2016. Further, the Respondent says it is not responsible for the Khrami Companies' decision to abandon the request for tariff adjustment. With respect to the Khrami Companies' 2017 applications, the Respondent says that adjustments were made in full compliance with the tariff provisions of the Khrami SPA.768\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 374; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 410.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 285, 322, 410.\n\n705.\n\nGardabani's claims pursuant to the Khrami SPA and the Respondents' defences to those claims were considered in detail and determined by the Tribunal in the SCC Arbitration. Having considered Gardabani's claims under the Khrami SPA in that Arbitration, the Tribunal found that Gardabani did not waive or fail to meet a condition precedent to its claims and found that the Respondents had breached their obligations under Clause 5.2.2 and Clause 2 of Annex #1 of the Khrami SPA.769 In the Partial Award on Liability and the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal determined that the Respondents, the Government, the MOE and the SSB, are required to compensate Gardabani and finally determined the extent of compensation due, in the amount of USD 27,499,000.770 As there is no indication that the Respondent has paid compensation to Gardabani to date, the Respondent must now compensate Gardabani in that amount pursuant to its obligation under Article 3(4) of the BIT.\n\nSCC Partial Award on Liability, \u00b6 794.\n\nSCC Final Award, \u00b6 125(b).\n\n**E. The Dispute Resolution Clauses in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nIn their Observations on the Partial Award, dated 14 May 2021, the Respondents raised an additional defence to the Claimants' claim under the Umbrella Clause in the BIT. In those Observations, the Respondent raised the objection that there can be no breach of an umbrella clause, where, as in this case, the underlying contracts provide for an exclusive dispute resolution mechanism available to the Claimants and which offers them effective means of redress.771 It says that a number of tribunals and commentators have confirmed that investors cannot invoke an umbrella clause provision in a treaty to circumvent an exclusive dispute resolution provision in the underlying contract.772 The Respondent referred in particular to the award of the tribunal in *Consutel v. Algeria*.773\n\nRespondents' Observations on the Partial Award, p. 5; Respondent's letter of 14 May 2021, p. 5.\n\nRespondents' Observations on the Partial Award, p. 5; Respondent's letter of 14 May 2021, p. 5, and the sources cited in fn 32.\n\n*Consutel Group S.p.A in Liquidazione v. People's Demcratic Republic of Algeria*, PCA Case No. 217-33, Final Award, dated 3 February 2020 (\"***Consutel***\" or \"***Consutel v. Algeria***\"), RL-0106, \u00b6\u00b6 372-375.\n\n707.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' position that breaches of contract are facts that support their umbrella law claim and not the legal causes of action under the BIT and that the dispute resolution mechanisms are irrelevant to the legal causes of action under the treaty, the Respondent refers to the award in *SGS v. Philippines* where the tribunal found that it could not \"\u2026accept that standard BIT jurisdiction clauses automatically override the binding selection of a forum by the parties to determine their contractual claims\" and that \"SGS should not be able to approbate and reprobate in respect of the same contract: if it claims under the contract, it should comply with the contract in respect of the very matter which is the foundation of its claim\".774\n\nRespondents' Letter of 23 June 2021, pp. 2-3, and the sources cited there; *SGS v. Philippines*, CL-0055, \u00b6 153.\n\n708.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' position that it had advanced a new argument late in the proceedings under the auspices of the implications of the Partial Award, but which is not dependent upon it, the Respondent says that it has always maintained that the BIT claims presented by Gardabani and Silk Road are duplicative of the contract claims submitted in the SCC arbitration.775 In any event, the Respondent says that it advanced its argument in accordance with the Tribunal's directions for further submissions on the implications of the Partial Award for the pending treaty claims and that both Parties had been given a fair and equal opportunity to be heard.776\n\nRespondents' Letter of 23 June 2021, p. 3, referring to Georgia's Answers in SCC Case No. V2017/098, dated 14 August 2017 and SCC Case No. V2017/097, dated 14 August 2017 and the Respondents' Submissions on Costs, dated 16 January 2020.\n\nRespondents' Letter of 14 May 2021, p. 1-2.\n\n**2. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n709.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent conflates their rights under the BIT with the contractual rights of the Parties to the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. According to the Claimants, breaches of contract are facts that support the Article 3(4) claims and not the legal causes of action under the treaty. Therefore, the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreements is irrelevant to the Claimants' BIT claims.\n\n710.\n\nThe Claimants say that in the Partial Award on Liability, the Tribunal found that the Respondents had breached their contractual obligations. However, it did not assess whether the Respondent violated the treaty by way of those breaches, nor could it have done so. According to the Claimants, the dispute resolution clauses in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA are only relevant in the sense that the Claimants in the SCC arbitration followed them and received a finding of contractual breach in that forum. As such, the findings in the Partial Award simply confirm the truth of the facts underlying the Claimants' umbrella clause claims in this arbitration.777\n\nClaimants' Letter of 3 June 2021, pp. 3-4.\n\n711.\n\nWith respect to the award in *SGS v. Philippines*, the Claimants say that the tribunal in that case observed only that a BIT's umbrella clause does not automatically displace a contractual dispute resolution clause in respect of contractual claims. The Claimants emphasize that their Article 3(4) claims are not contractual but, rather, based on a violation of the Respondent's treaty obligations. According to the Claimants, the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* concluded that the umbrella clause in the relevant treaty would apply once the contractual claim had been determined in accordance with the contractual dispute resolution clause.778\n\nClaimants' Letter of 2 July 2021, p. 2, referring to *SGS v. Philippines*, CL-0055, \u00b6 155 (\"Until the question of scope or extent of the Respondent's obligation to pay is clarified \u2013 whether by agreement between the parties or by proceedings in the Philippine courts as provided for in Article 12 of the CISS Agreement \u2013 a decision by this Tribunal on SGS's claim to payment would be premature\").\n\n712.\n\nFinally, as noted previously, the Claimants say that the Respondent's argument that the dispute resolution clauses in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA preclude their claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT constitutes a new argument which should have been argued from the outset. Further, they say that this new argument advanced under the auspices of the implications of the Partial Award is not dependent on the Partial Award.779\n\nClaimants' Letter of 3 June 2021, p. 4.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the 2013 Memorandum provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n9.3 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Memorandum, including those *relating to the breach, cessation or invalidity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n714.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the Khrami SPA provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n8.4 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. By virtue of this Agreement*, the Parties hereby unambiguously waive their rights use (sic) any other forum appeal, reconsideration or application to the court of any other country or other judicial authority, in case if such a waiver is legal.*\n\n715.\n\nThe Tribunal commences its analysis by noting that the Respondent's position is an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. As such, it should have been raised in the Respondents' Counter-Memorial or at least, in the Respondents' other pleadings on the merits. The argument is not one of admissibility and does not depend on the Partial Award on Liability or the other awards in the SCC Arbitration. Nevertheless, the Tribunal addresses the merits of the Respondent's objection.\n\n716.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is important to distinguish between the contractual rights arising under the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and Silk Road's and Gardabani's claims as investors under Article 3(4) of the BIT. The Tribunal addressed and determined the contractual obligations in the SCC Award and addresses here, in this award, rights and obligations arising at international law under the BIT. Although the Parties agreed to coordinate the two arbitrations, they did not consolidate them. The two arbitrations remain separate and address different rights and obligations, which is implicit in the Parties' agreement that the Tribunal must issue two separate awards.\n\n717.\n\nThe particular, complex circumstances of this arbitration distinguish it from the authorities on which the Respondent relies, in particular, the award in *Consutel v. Algeria* which addresses very different factual circumstances. The fundamental distinction is that in this case, the Claimants have not sought to circumvent exclusive jurisdiction clauses contained in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA. Rather, the dispute resolution processes provided for have been pursued and the Tribunal has determined the scope of those obligations and found that the Respondents, including in each case the Government acting on behalf of the State, and State entities, have breached their contractual obligations and must compensate the Claimants.\n\n718.\n\nNow that the compensation payable has been determined in accordance with the dispute resolution clauses in the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, the issue of the Respondent's observance or performance of its BIT obligations arises under the umbrella clause. The Tribunal notes that unlike the *Consutel* case, the Government of Georgia acting on behalf of the State is itself a party to each agreement and expressly undertakes to compensate for any damage or loss. In the case of the 2013 Memorandum, the Government undertook to compensate Inter RAO or the relevant Inter RAO Group company for all losses by a change in the legislation. In the case of the Khrami SPA, the Government undertook to bear full responsibility for any damage or loss incurred by Gardabani and/or the Khrami Companies resulting from the non-application of the relevant tariffs and their conditions of adjustment. Now that the nature and scope of the Respondent's obligation has been determined, it is now obliged to comply with it and pay compensation to the Claimants in this arbitration, Silk Road and Gardabani.\n\n719.\n\nAs discussed below, Silk Road and Gardabani claim the same amount of damages with respect to their tariff-related claims as were claimed by the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration. The specific compensation due is discussed in the next section of this Award.\n\n**F. The Respondent's Counter-Claim**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n720.\n\nIn the event the Tribunal determines that Silk Road and Gardabani are allowed to make claims pursuant to the umbrella clause, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal also has jurisdiction on the basis of Article 9 of the BIT, Article of the 46 ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to hear its counterclaim for 50% share of any TIA.780 The Respondent says Georgia's counterclaim is a direct counterpart to the Claimants' claims for alleged violations of obligations owed by Georgia to Telasi under the 2013 Memorandum, and that this nexus between the claims and counterclaims establishes the Tribunal's jurisdiction over counterclaims. The Respondent's arguments in support of its entitlement to a 50% share of the TIA from 2013-2016 are set out at paragraph , above.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 375-383; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 411-424; *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CL-0052, \u00b6 39; *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction over the Czech Republic's Couterclaim, dated 7 May 2004 (\"***Saluka v. Czech Republic II***\"), RL-0033, \u00b6 61.\n\n721.\n\nThe dispute resolution clause at Article 9 of the BIT covers:\n\n[A]*ny legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party... .*781\n\nGeorgia-Netherlands BIT, CL-0003, Art. 9.\n\n722.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n[T]*he Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.*782\n\nICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules, RL-0027, Art. 46.\n\n723.\n\nRule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides as follows:\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counterclaim arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.*783\n\n*Id*., Rule 40.\n\n724.\n\nThe Respondent says the Parties' consent to submit their dispute to ICSID arbitration establishes the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear counterclaims because the applicable procedural rules allow counterclaims (Article 46 and Rule 40, above). Several cases have recognized that a tribunal's jurisdiction under investment treaties extends to counterclaims, and thus the fact the Georgia-Netherlands BIT does not expressly give the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear counterclaims is of little784 importance.\n\n*See* Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378, 380-381, citing *Antoine Goetz and others v.

Czech Republic,* CL-0052, \u00b6 39; *Saluka v. Czech Republic II,* RL-0033, \u00b6 61.\n\n725.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimants' arguments that the language of the umbrella clause is not broad enough to give rise to counterclaims. The Respondent says Article 9 of the BIT is \"agnostic\" as to the identity of the claiming party and should not be read in the restrictive manner advocated by Claimants. The express choice of ICSID, which allows counterclaims, should be read as consistent with the absence of a limitation on counterclaims in Article 9.785\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 417.\n\n726.\n\nThe Respondent also contests the Claimants' arguments that Article 9 of the BIT codifies only Georgia's consent to arbitrate and not the Claimants' consent to adjudicate *any* dispute, and thus Article 3(4) of the BIT is asymmetrical and does not allow counterclaims. The Respondent refers to several cases which rejected arguments that the BIT's provisions were asymmetrical and no counterclaim could be raised by the State.786 The Respondent argues that the BIT does not limit the State's ability to raise counterclaims based on its procedural rights under the BIT, the 2013 Memorandum and Georgian law, thereby allowing the State to raise a counterclaim based on a system of law beyond the closed system in the BIT. While the BIT does not provide a choice of law, whereas the Spain-Argentina BIT at issue in the *Urbaser* case did, the Respondent says Article 42(1) ICSID Convention fills the gap with Georgian law and international law as the substantive basis for Georgia's counterclaims.787\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 418; *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award, dated 8 December 2016 (\"***Urbaser***\"), CL-0156, \u00b6 1143 (citing Argentina-Spain BIT, Art. X(1): \"disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute\". The Tribunal held that this clause is \"completely neutral as to the identity of the claimant or respondent in an investment dispute between arising 'between the parties'\", and thus does not limit counterclaims by the State); *Saluka v. Czech Republic II*, RL-0033, \u00b6 39 (citing Netherlands-Czech BIT, Art. 8: \"all disputes\" could be referred to arbitration); *Paushok v. Mongolia*, RL-0031, \u00b6 689 (citing Russia-Mongolia BIT, Art. 6: \"disputes\" broadly interpreted).\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 421-422. Respondents say the *Burlington v. Ecuador* tribunal did just that in considering counterclaims based on Ecuadorian law contracts and tort law because the US-Ecuador BIT did not contain an express choice of law and did not limit an arbitral tribunal to deciding the case solely on the BIT, the tribunal relied on Art. 42(1) ICSID Convention.\n\n727.\n\nRegarding the purported asymmetry of the umbrella clause, the Respondent says *Oxus Gold*, relied on by the Claimants, dealt with a clause that provided that only disputes \"concerning an obligation of the [host State] under this Agreement\" could go to arbitration. That tribunal held that the clause precluded the State's counterclaim and, even if it did not, there would be further hurdles to jurisdiction because the counterclaim was not closely connected to the primary claim, unlike the788 instant case.\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6 423, citing *Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan*, CL-0046, \u00b6 946.\n\n**2. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimants say neither Articles 9 or 3(4) of the BIT nor Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention grant the Tribunal jurisdiction over the Respondent's counterclaim for its alleged share of the TIA from 2013-2016.789 Similarly, interpreting Article 9 of the BIT in this way would suggest that any dispute between any foreign investor and Georgia would be arbitrable, despite no evidence that this was the Contracting Parties' intention and no supporting caselaw.790 Silk Road's Notice of Dispute, which the Claimants say perfected their agreement to arbitrate, only identified breaches of protections Georgia afforded to them under the BIT, and therefore does not contain the Claimants' consent to arbitrate *any* dispute or Georgia's counterclaim, but only those disputes \"arising between [Georgia] and a national of [the Netherlands] concerning an investment of that national in [Georgia]\".791 The Claimants also say Article 9 of the BIT is irrelevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction because Georgia cannot identify any substantive basis for its TIA counterclaim.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 208-212.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 21-31.\n\nGeorgia-Netherlands BIT, CL-0003, Art. 9.\n\n729.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Article 3(4)\u00a0umbrella clause does not permit Georgia to bring a treaty-based claim against Silk Road. The Respondent does not have a cause of action because it conditioned its counterclaim on Article 3(4) of the BIT, which only deals with obligations entered into by the \"Contracting Parties\" (Georgia and the Netherlands), not private parties/investors. The *Oxus Gold* tribunal observed that recourse to the umbrella clause is not possible because it refers to the host State's obligations only.792 The Claimants argue that the Respondent cannot overcome this hurdle by relying on Articles 46 and Rule 40 ICSID Arbitration Rules because the counterclaim is not \"within the scope of the consent of the parties\"793 to arbitration under the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 209; *Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan*, CL-0046, \u00b6 958(i).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 29; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 208-210, citing ICSID Convention, RL-0027, Art. 46.\n\n730.\n\nThe Claimants say Article 42 ICSID Convention is unavailing because it pertains to the law applicable to existing causes of action over which a tribunal already has jurisdiction.\n\n731.\n\nHowever, if the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction over Georgia's counterclaim, the Claimants invoke their arguments above that Georgia is not entitled to a cash payment of its share of the TIA.794\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 32; Tr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 137:21-138:16.\n\n732.\n\nThe Claimants also claim that the Parties' respective entitlements should be calculated and set off as of the date of the Tribunal's Award because the Claimants are entitled to set off any GRDs against the TIA claimed.795 The Claimants refer to Table 8.6 of the second Peer Expert Report, which shows that while there was a TIA from 2013 through to early 2016, starting in 2017 there was a GRD. The Claimants say that under the 2013 Memorandum, the deficits must be offset against the TIA and that tax must also be taken into account, which results in a cancelling out of the Respondent's counterclaim value in the actual scenario.796 The Claimants say that this right to set off is also supported by the provisions of the Georgian Civil Code.797 In the event that the Claimants are successful on their contractual claims, their damages model in the but-for scenario assumes a distribution of 50 percent of any TIA to the state.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 138:21-139:12; 140:22-141:4.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 141:5-11, citing GCC, Article 442.\n\n733.\n\nThe Claimants also contest Georgia's claim for interest from 1 January 2017. The earliest date from which interest could accrue is 25 November 2018 (i.e., the date of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial when the Respondent first requested the payment of the TIA in the two arbitrations).798 However, the Claimants maintain that there cannot be any interest until the Tribunal issues an award on the TIA because no payment was ever asked for by the state so the obligation to pay cannot arise until the Tribunal imposes it.799\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Claimants' Opening Statement), 141:12-17.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n734.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Article 9 of the BIT is sufficiently broad to include the Respondent's claim for a 50% share of the TIA. This claim clearly forms an integral part of the legal dispute between Silk Road and the Respondent and is closely linked to the obligation Silk Road pursues under Article 3(4) of the BIT.\n\n735.\n\nIn the Partial Award on Liability in the SCC Arbitration, the Tribunal found that the Respondent's Counterclaim must be assessed in the context of the Claimants' claims under the 2013 Memorandum and should be assessed as part of the reckoning of the losses claimed by the Claimants. The Tribunal also found that the MOE's entitlement to a 50% share of the TIA forms an integral part of the assessment of Telasi's position at the relevant times provided for in Clause 5.2 of the 2013 Memorandum and the calculation of any compensable loss. Accordingly, Telasi's entitlement to compensation was calculated by the Parties' respective quantum Experts, taking into account the MOE's 50% share of the TIA. As Silk Road relied on the same quantification of damages in this arbitration as the Claimants in the SCC Arbitration, the Respondent's counterclaim has been fully accounted for.\n\n736.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's counterclaim arises directly out of the subject-matter of the underlying dispute and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the counterclaim. The Respondents' entitlement to their 50% share of the TIA under the 2013 Memorandum was upheld in the SCC Arbitration and the relevant amount owing formed a necessary and integral part of the calculation of the Claimants' loss. The same is true in this arbitration where the Respondent's counterclaim forms part of the legal dispute between Silk Road and the Respondent. Accordingly, the Respondent's counterclaim also succeeds under the umbrella clause.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n737.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they are entitled to full compensation for the Respondent's treaty breaches. They note that the alleged wrongful conduct that led to violations of the Claimants' international law and Georgian law rights is largely the same, as is the harm suffered. The additional actions beyond those within the scope of the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA are the actions that introduced volatility into Telasi's purchase portfolio in 2017 and the diversion of the Khrami Companies' energy from Telasi to other buyers at a lower price in 2016 (two of the Supplemental Claims).\n\n738.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the legal standard under customary international law is full compensation pursuant to the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, which requires that all the consequences of the illegal act be wiped out.800 This is achieved by awarding compensation that restores the Claimants to the economic position they would have occupied but for the Respondent's treaty breaches. The Claimants argue that the correct assessment of their losses, which do not need to be proven with absolute certainty, should be based on the fair market value of their investment as it would have been in the absence of Georgia's wrongful conduct.801\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 284-287.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 290.\n\n739.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the measure of damages under Georgian law for breach of contract is very similar to the position under international law. Under Georgian law, damages include both actual, materialized damages and lost profit. Compensation should be such as to place the aggrieved party in the position it would have occupied \"but for\" the breach of contract. In order to be recoverable, the damages must be the consequence of the breaching party's actions and must have been foreseeable. Lost profit is due so long as it is directly connected to the breach of contract.802 The Claimants say that had the tariffs been adjusted according to the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami SPA and the 2011 Memorandum, the Khrami Companies and Telasi would have received additional profits, and that those losses were caused by the Respondent. They say that the loss of profits is a clear and necessary consequence of the failure to apply the tariff adjustment mechanisms in the agreements between the Parties. As such, the loss was entirely foreseeable and the Respondent is liable to compensate for the full loss of profits.803\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 291-294; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 213-216.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 295.\n\n740.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's arguments, the Claimants say that damages caused by an administrative body under public law contracts attract compensation in accordance with the normal rules of the Civil Code of Georgia, which are very similar to those provided by international law.804 In response to the Respondent's argument that they must prove their individual losses, the Claimants say that international arbitral tribunals quantify damages flexibly. They refer to the decisions in *Saphire International Petroleum Ltd. v. National Iranian Oil Company* and several other cases for the proposition that it is not necessary to prove the exact damage in order to award damages. Where proof of the exact damage suffered is not possible, it is sufficient for the adjudicator to find with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage.805 The Claimants say that they need only prove their losses with reasonable certainty, given the particular factual circumstances of this case. Further, they say that all that is required is to ascertain the extent of the total loss they suffered with reasonable certainty and they are not required to allocate damages to each specific breach.806 The Claimants say that international tribunals have held at that separate compensation is not required to be awarded for each separate treaty violation and referred to a number of awards in this regard. They say this is because multiple treaty violations are often based on the same offending governmental measure or measures. The Claimants say that international tribunals focus on whether the offending governmental measures caused loss and not whether a separate monetary amount could be attached to each breach.807\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 218. The Claimants say that the two instances under the GACG in which a balancing of public and private interests may be appropriate are irrelevant. They also distinguish the cases relied upon by the Respondent's expert, Dr. Turava. They say that these cases deal only with liquidated damages in respect of which Georgian courts have sometimes required the damages be limited to some standard of reasonableness of proportionality. In any event, the Claimants say that the damages they seek are not disproportionate to their business and investments. *See* Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 219-220.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 222-223 and the sources cited there.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 223.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 224.\n\n741.\n\nThe Claimants say that in this case their overall losses are not easily divided by breach since the methods for calculating tariff adjustments under the 2013 Memorandum and the 2014 Amended Methodology are completely different.808\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 225-233. Nevertheless, although not required, the Claimants say that their expert, Mr. Peer has attempted to allocate losses by categories of breaches, which, they say disposes of the Respondent's complaint. Further, the Claimants also say that if the Tribunal wishes to attribute losses between claims with greater particularity, the Parties' quantum experts can be requested to recalculate losses according to one or more scenarios depending on the Tribunal's findings.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n742.\n\nThe Respondent says that even if it had breached any obligation, which it denies, no compensation would be owed to the Claimants. The Respondent says that the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden to particularize their losses. In this regard, the Respondent relies on the award in the *Gami v. Mexico*:\n\n*One cannot fail to observe that Gami's complaint of alleged unfair and inequitable treatment is not connected with a demonstration of specific and quantifiable prejudice\u2026 Gami rather proceeds on the basis that the entire value of its investment has been destroyed\u2026 Gami's approach seems to be all or nothing. But no credible cause-and-effect analysis can lay the totality of Gami's disappointments as an investor at the feet of the Mexican Government\u2026 Gami can assert only that mal administration of [Mexico] sugar program caused it some prejudice. But the prejudice must be particularized and quantified. Gami has not done so.809*\n\nRespondent's Counter Memorial, \u00b6 387, citing *Gami Investments, Inc. v. Mexico,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, dated 15 November 2004 (\"***Gami***\" or \"***Gami v. Mexico***\"), RL-0013, \u00b6 83.\n\n743.\n\nThe Respondent says that under Georgian law, a claimant must prove that its alleged losses were caused by the wrongful actions of the respondent in order to obtain compensation. Therefore, the Claimants must demonstrate with specificity which damages flow from which breach. The Respondent says that it is not sufficient for the Claimants to quantify their alleged losses on the basis of \"tariff breaches\" which they define as \"the loss that the Claimants suffered from the breach of the Khrami SPA and the 2013 Memorandum that also represents a breach of the BIT\". The Respondent says that the Claimants' expert's damages model does not connect with any degree of specificity the quantum claimed and the alleged losses of the relevant provisions of the 2013 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and the BIT. On this basis, the Respondent says that the Claimants' damages claim should be rejected.810\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 388-391.\n\n744.\n\nThe Respondent also says that the Claimants' claim for damages is premised on unreasonable, speculative assumptions.811 These arguments are discussed below where the Tribunal addresses the detail of the calculation of the Claimants' damages claim.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 392-407; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 425-452. The Respondent also says that a reasonableness check against objective measures of performance shows that the Claimants' damages claim is unreliable and overstated with respect to Telasi. *See* Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 453-458.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nIn this arbitration, Silk Road and Gardabani claim damages for breach of their rights under the BIT. With the exception of the Supplemental Claims, which are advanced in this arbitration only, the Claimants in both this arbitration and the SCC Arbitration claim the same amounts. According to the Claimants, the measure of damages under international law and Georgian law is very similar. While analytically and legally distinct, simultaneous contractual and treaty breaches attract \"full compensation\". The Claimants say that damages for treaty and contractual breaches must restore claimants to the economic position they would have been in had the breaches not occurred.812 On that basis, the Claimants provided the same calculation of damages for their claims relating to the tariffs of Telasi and the Khrami Companies.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 216.\n\n746.\n\nThe Respondents have not disputed that the measure of damages for international and contractual breaches in this case is similar. Rather, they disputed that the Claimants had properly quantified the losses claimed in a number of ways, including reliance on unreasonable assumptions and the inclusion of alleged hypothetical future losses which resulted in unreliable and overstated damage claims.813\n\nRespondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 425-464.\n\n747.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed in detail the Parties' respective submissions relating to the assessment and quantification of damages in the First and Second Partial Awards on Damages and the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration. The Parties did not distinguish between the measure of damages for international law and Georgian contract law breaches in their submissions on damages and the Parties' Experts did not differentiate between the measure of damages for international and contractual breaches in their various calculations and joint reports.\n\n748.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the Parties' submissions on damages and their Experts' joint reports, the Tribunal fixed the compensation payable by the Respondents for breach of contract in the SCC Final Award. The damages claimed by Silk Road and Gardabani in this arbitration under the umbrella clause in the BIT relate to the same underlying obligations and, with one exception, have been calculated in the same manner.\n\n749.\n\nIn this arbitration, Silk Road's and Gardabani's claims have been calculated on a Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) basis since their claims are based on losses suffered by their investments, Telasi and the Khrami Companies. However, in the SCC Arbitration the Claimants calculated damages on both a Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) to Telasi and on an FCFE basis to Inter RAO and Silk Road. In the SCC Final Award the Tribunal awarded compensation to Telasi in the amount of USD 84,500,000.814\n\nSCC Final Award, \u00b6 89.\n\n750.\n\nSilk Road's claim in this arbitration must be calculated on an FCFE basis and amounts to USD 48,427,000. For the Historical Period from 31 March 2013 to 30 June 2021, the Parties' Experts' agreed calculation on an FCFE basis using a valuation date of 31 December 2020 was USD 35,934,000.815 For the Forecast Period from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2025, in the SCC Final Award the Tribunal adopted the Respondent's Expert's, Dr. Moselle's, approach to the two disputes between the Experts (Valuation Date and FCFF Components) in fixing the compensation payable to Telasi. Adopting the same approach in the calculation of compensation due to Silk Road on an FCFE basis yields the amount of USD 12,493,000.816 Therefore, the compensation due to Silk Road is USD 48,427,000, which represents a portion of the losses awarded to Telasi in the SCC Arbitration on an FCFF basis.\n\nJER 3, \u00b6 2.9. The Claimants' claim with respect to Inter RAO and Silk Road was identical and calculated on the same FCFE basis.\n\nSCC Final Award, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; JER 4, \u00b6 2.8.\n\n751.\n\nCompensation due to Gardabani is calculated on an FCFE basis in both arbitrations and amounts to USD 27,499,000.\n\n752.\n\nThe Claimants have stated that the damages they seek in this arbitration overlap with those claimed in the SCC Arbitration and have undertaken not to seek double compensation. Therefore, any compensation payable in this arbitration is subject to the payment of compensation pursuant to the SCC Final Award and the Claimants' express undertaking.\n\n**IX. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n753.\n\nEach of the Parties claimed interest on the amounts awarded in relation to their respective claims and counterclaims. The Parties' quantum experts took pre-award interest into account in their calculations, without disagreement.817 As a result, the only relevant issue for the Tribunal's determination is post-award interest.\n\n*See* paragraph 90 of the Final Award in the SCC Arbitration and the sources cited there: Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 324-325; Claimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, dated 5 July 2022 (\"**Claimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 4-11; Respondents' Submissions on Costs and Interest, dated 5 July 2022 (\"**Respondents' Additional Submissions on Costs and Interest**\"), \u00b6 17. In their Memorial, at \u00b6 325, the Claimants stated that since their assessment of losses included interest as of the date of assessment, no separate pre-judgment interest is required.\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n754.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Tribunal should award post-award interest at a reasonable commercial rate. The Claimants maintain that the Tribunal should adopt a post-judgment interest rate similar to that used by the Experts in their calculations in their Joint Expert Reports assessing losses. On that basis, the Claimants say that the appropriate interest rates for 2021 and 2022 are 4.4% and 6.5% respectively.818\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 326-328; Claimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.\n\n755.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal could award interest at an annual rate equal to the annual average yield to maturity on 5-year dollar-denominated Georgian Government bonds. They say that this would reflect Georgia's borrowing cost, on the basis that by withholding compensation, the Respondents have forced the Claimants to lend those funds to the State. On this basis, the Claimants say that the relevant interest rates are 2.5% for 2021 and 6% for 2022.819\n\nClaimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, \u00b6 18.\n\n756.\n\nIn further alternative, the Claimants say that if the Tribunal does not accept these alternatives, post-judgment interest should be set at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 2%.820\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 19.\n\n757.\n\nThe Claimants also say that interest should be compounded on a quarterly basis until payment in full.821 The Claimants say that compounding on a quarterly basis reflects the commercial uses to which compensation could have been put if it had been paid in a timely manner. According to the Claimants, investment arbitration tribunals often award post-award interest on a compound basis and refer to certain awards in that regard.822 With respect to the effective date from which interest should accrue, the Claimants say that their losses were assessed as of 31 December 2020. However, the first tranche of damages was awarded later, in the Second Award on Damages, dated 23 November 2021, with the remaining portion to be awarded in the Final Award. The Claimants say that the Respondents have not paid any part of the compensation awarded to them.823 Therefore, interest should accrue from the day after the valuation date, 1 January 2021. Otherwise, the Claimants say that they would be left with less money than they would have received had the Respondents paid compensation on the valuation date.824 With respect to the Respondents' claims for interest, the Claimants say that no such interest is due since these claims were offset against the damages awarded to the Claimants. Since the balance is in favour of the Claimants, no amount is due to the Respondents.825\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 20; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 326-328, 337(b); Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 270(b).\n\nClaimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, \u00b6 20; *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No ARB/15/28, Award, dated 24 April 2019, CL-0235, \u00b6 885; *Crystallex v. Venezuel*a, CL-0024, \u00b6 935.\n\nClaimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, \u00b6 13.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, \u00b6 22. With respect to pre-award interest, the Claimants say that interest on the Respondents' Counterclaims could not have accrued before 25 November 2018 (the date of the Respondents' Counter-Memorial and Memorial on Counterclaims), since this was the first date on which payment of the TIA was requested. *See* Claimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, \u00b6 23.\n\n**B. The Respondents' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n758.\n\nThe Respondents provided submissions on post award interest only, since pre-award interest has been taken into account in the Experts' calculations.826 The Respondents say that any post-award interest should be awarded at the six-month USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"**SOFR**\") plus 2% should be adopted as a reasonable commercial arbitration rate for post-award interest.827 The Respondents say that the Tribunal should apply this rate as of 23 December 2021, the date that the sums awarded in the Second Partial Award on Damages fell due (30 days after the issuance of the Second Partial Award on Damages, pursuant to paragraph of that Award).828\n\nRespondents' Additional Submissions on Costs and Interest, \u00b6 17.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. The Respondents say that since LIBOR is being phased out, arbitral tribunals have found that the SOFR is an appropriate replacement.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 27.\n\n759.\n\nThe Respondents say that interest should be awarded on a simple basis as there are no special circumstances justifying an award of compound interest in this case. Further, the Respondents say that the award of compound interest is not authorized under Georgian law.829 The Respondent says that the award of interest is not, as submitted by the Claimants, to \"incentivize\" a party to satisfy an award. Rather, it is to provide full compensation and should not have a punitive function.830 According to the Respondents, absent specific circumstances that would justify awarding compound interest, only simple interest should be awarded.831 Further, the Respondents say that the Claimants have accepted that compound interest is not authorized under Georgian law and that in these circumstances, simple interest at a reasonable commercial rate is appropriate in the SCC Arbitration.832 As the dispute between the Parties is contractual and the claims in the ICSID Arbitration are entirely duplicative of the contractual claims brought in this arbitration, there is no reason to award compound interest in the ICSID Arbitration.833\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 22.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 26; Respondents' Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 408-411; Respondents' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 468-471.\n\nRespondents' Submissions on Costs and Interest, \u00b6 20; Claimants' Letter to the Tribunal, dated 29 June 2021, p. 3.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 26\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n760.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, post-award interest should accrue as of 24 December 2021, the day following the date on which specific sums, which were first awarded by the Tribunal in the Second Partial Award on Damages, fell due. The Tribunal is not persuaded that post-award interest should run from the assessment date of 31 December 2020, as submitted by the Claimants.\n\n761.\n\nWith respect to the applicable rate of interest, the Tribunal finds that in the circumstances of this case, the six-month USD SOFR plus 2% rate proposed by the Respondents is a reasonable commercial rate for post-award interest. The Tribunal is not persuaded that the other alternatives submitted by the Claimants would be appropriate. Although the Claimants have argued that in investment treaty cases compound interest should be, and often is, awarded, the Tribunal is not persuaded that awarding post-award interest on a compound basis would be appropriate. In particular, the Tribunal sees no basis for awarding different rates of interest in the two arbitrations. Accordingly, interest is awarded on a simple basis.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n762.\n\nIn this arbitration, the relevant rules on costs are Article 61 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The relevant provisions referred to by the Parties are as follows:\n\nICSID Convention\n\nArticle 61 (1)\n\n(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules\n\nRule 28\n\nCost of Proceeding\n\n(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:\n\n(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;\n\n(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.\n\n(2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the cost of the proceeding.\n\n763.\n\nIn their submissions, the Parties also addressed Articles 49 and 50 of the SCC Arbitration Rules. Article 49, which provide as follows:\n\nArticle 49 Costs of the Arbitration\n\n(1) The Costs of the Arbitration consist of: (i) the Fees of the Arbitral Tribunal; (ii) the Administrative Fee; and (iii) the expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the SCC.\n\n[...]\n\n(6) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the request of a party, apportion the Costs of the Arbitration between the parties, having regard to the outcome of the case, each party's contribution to the efficiency and expeditiousness of the arbitration and any other relevant circumstances.\n\nArticle 50 Costs incurred by a party\n\nUnless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may in the final award, at the request of a party, order one party to pay any reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs for legal representation, having regard to the outcome of the case, each party's contribution to the efficiency and expeditiousness of the arbitration and any other relevant circumstances.\n\n764.\n\nThe Parties agree that the rules governing the award of costs under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules\u00a0and the SCC Arbitration Rules are similar and provide the Tribunal broad discretion in allocating costs. Although the Parties referred to different aspects of the procedure in both the SCC Arbitration and the ICSID Arbitration, they did not distinguish between the two arbitrations for the purposes of their claims on costs which sought a single award of costs covering both arbitrations.\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n765.\n\nThe Claimants say that the general basic principle is that costs show follow the event. Therefore, if they are the successful Party in the arbitrations, even if only substantially successful, they should be awarded their full costs. The Claimants say that the successful Party should only be denied its costs if it has needlessly prolonged the proceedings or otherwise conducted itself improperly. The Claimants say that they have conducted the arbitration efficiently and acted in good faith. In this regard, they sought to maximize efficiency by agreeing to the consolidation of the SCC Arbitrations and proposing a method of coordinating the ICSID and SCC Arbitrations. They also say they advanced their full case from the beginning, thus ensuring a fair opportunity for the Respondents to develop a full defence at the appropriate stages of the arbitration.834 In response to the Respondents' argument, the Claimants say that the commencement of parallel arbitrations was not an abuse of process and did not unnecessarily complicate or increase the costs of the arbitrations. According to the Claimants, they are distinct legal entities with rights under different instruments. Therefore, they were entitled to pursue a remedy in the forum designated in the relevant instrument: the 2013 Memorandum, the Khrami SPA and the BIT. In order to promote efficiency in time and cost, the Claimants say they agreed to consolidate the SCC Arbitrations and coordinate the SCC and ICSID Arbitrations. They say they were entitled to advance their claims under alternative liability bases and that they should be denied costs for having commenced parallel claims.835\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, dated 16 January 2020, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimants' Reply Submission on Costs, dated 30 January 2020 (\"**Claimants' Reply on Costs**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n766.\n\nIn response to the Respondents' argument, the Claimants say they did not cause unnecessary expense in their conduct of the arbitration by *inter alia*, bringing the Supplemental Claims in the ICSID Arbitration. They say these claims were appropriate and valid.836\n\nClaimants' Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. The Claimants say that their document production requests in respect of the diversion of the Khrami Company's electricity and sales were legitimate and could not have generated significant costs. Further, the Tribunal ordered production in several of these requests and the Respondents agreed to search for and produce documents in relation to a number of items; although the Claimants did not quantify their claim for the cost of new connections, this represented a breach of Silk Road's rights under the BIT and the fact that it did not lead to a claim for additional damages is irrelevant; with respect to the claim relating to Telasi's Purchase Portfolio Volatility, the Claimants say that the quantum claim is immaterial to the legitimacy of the claim, particularly where it evidenced further breaches of rights under the BIT.\n\n767.\n\nThe Claimants also maintain that their document production requests were proper and consistent with the process agreed in the arbitrations. They say that the fact that the Respondents made fewer document production requests does not demonstrate an abuse of procedural rights.837\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15.\n\n768.\n\nWith respect to the Respondents' claim for costs, the Claimants say that the Respondents should not be awarded costs even if they succeed substantially in the arbitrations. The Claimants allege that the Respondents' conduct was inefficient and uncooperative in a number of respects.838\n\nClaimants' First Submissions on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 17-21; Claimants' Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n769.\n\nThe Claimants also maintain that the Respondents' counterclaims unnecessarily increased the Parties' costs. In this regard, the Claimants say that the Respondents gave no indication that they would be advancing counterclaims in response to the Claimants' Request for Arbitration. In addition, the Claimants say they had to dedicate additional resources to respond to two separate counterclaims that were virtually identical in substance. They also allege that the scope of the Respondents' counterclaims changed drastically between the Counter-Memorial and the Rejoinder.839 The Claimants' updated Statement of Costs provides as follows:840\n\n**Claimants' Statement of Costs**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type of fees and expenses** | **Details/ Law firm/Expert** | **Total (in USD)** | **Total (in \u20ac)** | **Total (in RUB)** | **Total (in GEL)** |\n| Legal fees and expenses (including VAT where | Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer | 8,625,096 |  |  |  |\n| applicable) | Dentons | 373,315 |  |  |  |\n|  | DLA Piper | 80,183 |  |  |  |\n| Advances on the costs of the Tribunal, ICSID and SCC | ICSID | 450,000 |  |  |  |\n|  | SCC | 100,000 | 300,000 |  |  |\n| Experts' fees and | Compass Lexecon | 512,466 |  |  |  |\n| expenses | KPMG | 572,173 | 650,739 |  |  |\n|  | Deloitte | 107,555 |  |  |  |\n| Party expenses (including applicable taxes) | Travel and related costs of the witnesses and party representatives |  | 3,093 | 3,229,480 | 47,058 |\n\nClaimants' First Submissions on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n\nClaimants' Additional Submission on Interest and Costs, Appendix A. Footnotes have been omitted.\n\n**B. The Respondents' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n770.\n\nIn their initial submissions on costs, the Respondents maintain that as the successful Party, they would be entitled to recover of all their costs of the Arbitrations. In this regard, the Respondents submitted that tribunals have applied the principle of \"costs follow the event\" toward the successful party all or a portion of its costs.841 Where a claimant prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, the Respondents say that tribunals typically take into account the relative success of the parties' respective claims and defences in allocating costs.842\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, dated 16 January 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 3-6; Respondents' Reply Submission on Costs, dated 30 January 2020 (\"**Respondents' Reply on Costs**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.\n\nRespondents' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 7.\n\n771.\n\nThe Respondents argued that should they prevail in the Arbitrations, there is no reason to depart from the principle of costs following the event. The Respondents contest the Claimants' allegations with respect to their response to document production requests, the timing and scope of their expert evidence and their counterclaims.843 The Respondents also submitted that the Claimants should be ordered to bear at least part of the Respondents' costs, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitrations, because the Claimants caused the dispute to be unnecessarily complex and costly by: commencing three arbitrations against the Respondents; bringing duplicative contract and treaty claims based on the same underlying facts and challenged measures; and purporting to justify the difference between their duplicative contract and treaty claims by bringing a series of meritless treaty claims.844\n\nRespondents' Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 5-13.\n\nRespondents' Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17.\n\n772.\n\nThe Respondents also say that the Claimants increased the costs of document production by their overbroad requests for documents to support meritless claims.845 The Respondents also complained that the Claimants did not answer their full case from the beginning, as alleged, but, rather, raised new arguments in Peer's direct presentation at the hearing which required the Respondents to compel leave to submit additional evidence from Dr. Moselle.846\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 18.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 19.\n\n773.\n\nThe Respondents also argued that the Claimants' costs are unreasonable. In this regard, they say that the Claimants' decision to bring duplicative contract and treaty claims greatly increased their costs, which the Respondents should not be required to bear. The Respondents also challenged the costs claimed with respect to the expert reports filed by Dr. Abdala and Mr. Delamer for the preparation of three expert reports in respect of the Claimants' very small claim in connection with the volatility of Telasi's Purchase Portfolio.847 The Respondents changed their primary position in their updated submissions on costs in which it maintains that the Parties should each bear their own costs. The Respondents say that irrespective of the Claimants' partial success in the SCC Arbitration, they should not be made to bear the Claimants' costs in the two arbitrations. In this regard, the Respondents say that the Parties' disputes were caused in part by the unclear wording of the 2013 Memorandum and the difficulty in its interpretation. Further, the Claimants did not prevail on all of their claims while the Respondents' prevailed on their counterclaim.848\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 23. The Respondents say that the Claimants claimed USD 512,466 in expert fees and expenses in respect of a claim for USD 13,000. The Respondents say that the costs in question are unreasonable and should not be borne by them irrespective of the Tribunal's findings. The Respondents also challenged the claim for costs incurred by Deloitte, which did not specify how they related to the Arbitrations. The Respondents say that any costs incurred in respect of Deloitte's preparation of Annual Independent Reports on Telasi Performance Indicators was required under the 2013 Memorandum and would have been incurred by Telasi in any event. *See* Respondents' Reply on Costs, \u00b6 24.\n\nRespondents' Additional Submissions on Costs and Interest, \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.\n\n774.\n\nThe Respondent also says that the Claimants unnecessarily complicated the quantum phase of the SCC Arbitration. After having presented their damages claim in the amount of USD $199.5 million dollars at the hearing, the Claimants maintained a claim for damages amounting to USD $205 million after the Tribunal had found in the Respondents' favour with respect to several issues in the Partial Award on Liability. Therefore, the Claimants' updated damages calculations did not properly take the findings in the Partial Award on Liability into account.849\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 10.\n\n775.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal found in the Respondents' favour on the great majority of the disputed issues in the First and Second Partial Awards on Damages.850 The Respondents say that in similar circumstances, arbitral tribunals have held costs of the proceeding should be shared equally between the parties and that the parties should bear their own legal fees and expenses.851 The Respondents also maintain that an equal apportionment of costs is particularly appropriate in the circumstances of these Arbitrations in which the Claimants caused the disputes to be unnecessarily complex and costly. In this regard, the Respondents refer to: the Claimants commencement of three separate arbitrations against the Respondents and bringing duplicative contract and treaty claims based on the same underlying facts and measures; the Claimants' compelling the Respondents to expend an inordinate amount of time and resources to rebut the Supplemental Claims in the ICSID Arbitration which were largely unsubstantiated by any evidence; and the Claimants' use of document production to fish for non-existent evidence to support their meritless Supplemental Claims.852\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 11.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 12 and the sources cited there.\n\nRespondents' Additional Submissions on Costs and Interest, \u00b6 13.\n\n776.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondents maintain that they should not have to bear any of the Claimants' costs and request that the Tribunal order the costs of the proceedings to be shared equally between the Parties and that each Party bear its own legal fees and other costs.\n\nThe Respondents provided an updated Statement of Costs as follows:853\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount as at 31 December 2019** | **Additional Amount as at 30 June 2022** | **Total** |\n| White & Case LLP Legal Fees | USD 6,175,059 | USD 889,983.70 | USD 7,065,042.7 |\n| White & Case LLP Expenses | USD 103,865.08 | USD 3,245.63 | USD 107,110.71 |\n| Ministry of Justice Costs | GEL 80,577.79 | GEL 17,694.50 | GEL 88,272.29 |\n| Dr. Moselle's Fees and Expenses | USD 1,462,244.81 | USD 513,420.6 | USD 1,975,665.41 |\n| Prof. Turava's Fees and Expenses | USD 9,000 | / | USD 9,000 |\n| Prof. Tercier's Fee and Expenses | EUR 8,880 | / | EUR 8,880 |\n| SCC Costs | EUR 42,845 | / | EUR 42,845 |\n| ICSID and Tribunal Costs | / | / | To be determined by ICSID in due course |\n\n*Id.*, \u00b616. Footnotes omitted. These costs and expenses are in addition to the Tribunal's fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of Professor Tercier, and the administrative charges of ICSID and of SCC. The Respondents reserve their right to update their Statement of Costs should further significant costs be incurred after 30 June 2022, including, for example responding to the Claimants' applications seeking to add certain documents to the record.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n777.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the Parties' submissions on costs and considered their conduct of the Arbitration, the outcome of the various disputes addressed in the Partial Award on Liability, the First and Second Partial Awards on Damages and this Final Award in the SCC Arbitration as well as the outcome of the dispute in the ICSID Arbitration, the Tribunal finds that the Parties should share the cost of the proceedings equally and that each Party should bear its own legal fees and other costs.\n\n778.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as in the case of the SCC Arbitration, success in this arbitration has been mixed. While the Claimants have succeeded in obtaining a substantial award, it is significantly less than they claimed. Further, the Respondent has been successful in its counterclaim and with respect to a number of contested issues related to the calculation of damages.\n\n779.\n\nWith respect to the Parties' conduct of the Arbitrations, they pursued their claims and defences vigorously, but did not exceed the bounds of appropriate, diligent conduct, particularly in light of the complexity of the issues in Arbitrations.\n\n780.\n\nThe estimated costs of these arbitration proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |\n| Mr. Henri C. Alvarez KC | 257,671.06 |\n| Professor Stanimir Alexandrov | 111,813.77 |\n| Professor Zachary Douglas KC | 119,823.83 |\n| Professor Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n | 5,625.00 |\n| Assistant Elsa Sardinha's fees and |  |\n|  | 69,521.00 |\n| expenses |  |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 252,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 92,878.97 |\n| **Total** | **909,333.63** |\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts. As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 454,666.815.\n\n781.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties, which will be reflected in ICSID's final financial statement.\n\n**XI.
